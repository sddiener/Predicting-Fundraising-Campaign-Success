</div><p>Hi, I’m Raymond Cuttill. I’m a 62 year old who has always dreamed of being a comedian. Basically I’ve done very little about it until now. I have done a few open mics and I could work my way up to the Edinburgh Fringe in a few years time but have I got the time? So at the last minute I decided to try to perform at the Edinburgh Fringe this coming month. It’s something I’ll remember the rest of my life (even if that’s only 2 weeks LOL). </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you may know the Scottish Referendum is on September 18th, shortly after the Fringe. Here the Scottish decide if they want to be independent of the United Kingdom, including of course England. Are we dragging them down? So I thought what about an English campaign for Scottish Independence? Are they dragging us down? Hence the campaign Independence for Scotland But We’ll Keep The Oil (lots of oil off Scotland). Or to put it another way Sod Off Scotland. So the campaign was born and where better to present but in Edinburgh in the heart of Scotland. I hope (I’m pretty sure) they’ve got a sense of humour (or humor) so that’s my dream. Go and perform. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It’s such a quick decision that nothing’s been arranged so I’m going and plan to join in wherever anyone has dropped out or in compilation shows or even help out where I can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I’m going to Edinburgh in my campervan. I need a small amount to live on and travel around Edinburgh and maybe do some promotion. I’m throwing caution to the winds and going to try it. I’ll be asking around about spare spots in the Fringe and I’ll be sending out press releases for the Sod Off Scotland campaign. I hope to lighten up the serious Scottish Independence debate. I may even do radio or TV interviews.</p>

Typhoon’s Nancy, Violet and Ida all generated speeds in excess of 200 mph while out at sea but slowed prior to encountering land. Haiyan is the second category 5 typhoon to hit the Philippines in 2013, following on from typhoon Usagi in September.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5em; text-align: justify;""> Allied with the destructive power of the winds, the storm surge of a typhoon often causes extensive damage. Despite the extreme nature of the winds during Haiyan, the storm surge contributed most to the destruction and loss of life. The worst area of the Philippines to suffer from the storm surge was Tacloban City, where the surge rose to a height of 2.3m, destroying vast swathes of property and devastating the population. Prior to the typhoon 220,000 people resided in Tacloban City.</p><p style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5em; text-align: justify;""></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""326"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/8UJW84Fqhgw?feature=oembed"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5em; text-align: justify;"">
Whilst the international relief effort has pledged money and assistance, the efforts have been hampered by the sheer scope of the destruction to the infrastructure to the country and the slow mobilisation of aid by the government. The United Nations estimates that presently 2.5 million people desperately require aid, with reports of hunger and thirst widespread amongst survivors.</p><p style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5em; text-align: justify;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/236563/files/20131202070435-1472774_10152197168162018_1950134333_n.jpg?1385996675"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em;""/></p><p style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5em; text-align: justify;""><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/212382/files/20131120133353-WHOAREWE.jpg?1384983233"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em;""/><br/></p><p style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5em; text-align: justify;"">The Haiyan Benefit Anthology is the result of a collaboration of independent comic book creators from around the world who wanted to help raise awareness and funds for those affected by Typhoon Haiyan.</p><p style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5em; text-align: justify;"">The comic book creators whose work will be featured in this anthology and art book all came together through various Facebook groups which act as a nexus point for international creatives to collaborate and educate eachother to form a working community of like minded individuals.</p><p style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5em; text-align: justify;""></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/222584/files/20131125114552-openbook2__1_.png?1385408752"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/212394/files/20131120133659-THEANTHO.jpg?1384983419"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: bold; text-align: center;""/><br/></p><p style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5em; text-align: justify;""></p><p>The Haiyan Benefit anthology is the brainchild of comic writer Phil Woodward.

<p style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5em; text-align: justify;"">Because the country has many islands and is inhabited by different ethnic groups, Philippine mythology and superstitions are very diverse. However, certain similarities exist among these groups, such as the belief in Heaven (kaluwalhatian, kalangitan, kamurawayan), Hell (impiyerno, kasamaan), and the human soul (kaluluwa).</p><p style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5em; text-align: justify;""></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""326"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/2ePhqoyLpXQ?feature=oembed"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5em; text-align: justify;"">The stories of ancient Philippine mythology include deities, creation stories, mythical creatures, and beliefs. Ancient Philippine mythology varies among the many indigenous tribes of the Philippines.

We have been struck by the magnitude of the devastation that Typhoon Haiyan has brought upon the Philippines. Together with creators from all over the globe we are donating our talents to create an anthology. Our goal is to raise money for the relief and response efforts in the aftermath of super typhoon Haiyan.When the category-5 super typhoon Haiyan made landfall in the Philippines on Friday the 8th of November 2013, with speeds ranging from 190-195 mph, it achieved the rank of the strongest storm to ever make landfall. Typhoon’s Nancy, Violet and Ida all generated speeds in excess of 200 mph while out at sea but slowed prior to encountering land. Haiyan is the second category 5 typhoon to hit the Philippines in 2013, following on from typhoon Usagi in September.
 Allied with the destructive power of the winds, the storm surge of a typhoon often causes extensive damage. Despite the extreme nature of the winds during Haiyan, the storm surge contributed most to the destruction and loss of life. The worst area of the Philippines to suffer from the storm surge was Tacloban City, where the surge rose to a height of 2.3m, destroying vast swathes of property and devastating the population. Prior to the typhoon 220,000 people resided in Tacloban City.

Whilst the international relief effort has pledged money and assistance, the efforts have been hampered by the sheer scope of the destruction to the infrastructure to the country and the slow mobilisation of aid by the government. The United Nations estimates that presently 2.5 million people desperately require aid, with reports of hunger and thirst widespread amongst survivors.The Haiyan Benefit Anthology is the result of a collaboration of independent comic book creators from around the world who wanted to help raise awareness and funds for those affected by Typhoon Haiyan.The comic book creators whose work will be featured in this anthology and art book all came together through various Facebook groups which act as a nexus point for international creatives to collaborate and educate eachother to form a working community of like minded individuals.The Haiyan Benefit anthology is the brainchild of comic writer Phil Woodward. The idea was to bring together comic creators from all over the globe to produce 150 colour pages of monsters and myths from Filipino folklore.This collection of stories includes work many published creators all of whom have given up their time and talents free of charge to raise money for those affected by the Haiyan disaster.The covers featured in this campaign are only demo covers,  real covers will be revealed upon completion of projectWork has begun and below are a couple of examples of whats to comeBy Jane StrawBy Frank AgnessThe art book will feature pages of art based on the same myths and legends as the anthology and will be in full colour.It will feature talented artists from all over the globe and will contain various styles not confined to comic art.We have already begun work on producing some imagery and below is our first couple of finished pin-ups.  1) Sarangay:  Pencils and Inks by Graeme Howard with Colours by Lancelot Catan.2) Serina: art work by Tek TanBy Mick AbbathThe sketch book will feature pages of concept work and sketches from both anthology and art book and will be a special extra item at higher packages.  It will feature talented artists from all over the globe and will contain various styles not confined to comic art.As part of the set it shows the base building blocks for some mesmerizing art work.Here are some examples of sketches that will be in the bookBy Craig SherbertBy Frank AgnessPhilippine mythology includes a collection of tales and superstitions about magical creatures and entities. Some Filipinos, even though heavily Christianized, still believe in these tales. The prevalence of belief in the figures of Philippines mythology is strong in the provinces.
Because the country has many islands and is inhabited by different ethnic groups, Philippine mythology and superstitions are very diverse. However, certain similarities exist among these groups, such as the belief in Heaven (kaluwalhatian, kalangitan, kamurawayan), Hell (impiyerno, kasamaan), and the human soul (kaluluwa).
The stories of ancient Philippine mythology include deities, creation stories, mythical creatures, and beliefs. Ancient Philippine mythology varies among the many indigenous tribes of the Philippines. Some groups during the pre-Spanish conquest era believed in a single Supreme Being who created the world and everything in it, while others chose to worship a multitude of tree and forest deities (diwatas).                                          upgrade your pledge with one of the heroic and Legendary perksAll printed material does not include shipping, please see table attached and add the relevant amount to your pledge. All prints will ship with books unless bought as an additional item with the digital pledges.Once the time comes to start shipping, a survey will be sent out asking for your current address.

Even before the typhoon Yolanda entered Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR), food and non-food items were already prepositioned in PRC Cebu Regional Warehouse consisting of 2,000 tins of ready to eat food, 4,000 blankets, 4,000 plastic mats, 2,000 hygiene kits, 2,000 jerry cans, 10 units of health emergency tents and 5,000 of food and non-food items with support from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)Once printing costs and shipping have been deducted from the fund, all proceeds from the Anthology will then go to the Philippine Red Cross who will determine the best allocation to resident victims impacted by the event. (For more information about the Philippine Red Cross and other ways to contribute.)This is a not-for-profit endeavor. All creative effort, art, design, editorial and managerial contributions made in the creation of this anthology were donated by those involved.
If you're unable to donate or want to do more to help the goal of the team behind the anthology then please share this with friends and family of whom may be able to help
Alternatively you can visit our Facebook fan page and keep up to date with production and information that will be posted regularly on the page.
 On behalf of the team i would like to express our gratitude for not only supporting this project but for helping us make a difference, remembering those who have died and bringing hope to those now faced with the aftermath of this tragedy.                              There are no major risk factors. This project is my team and my primary objective! Most of us are freelance artist and writers so we have huge amounts of time on our hands. Everyone is on board! My team and I are very diligent and determined to finish this project even if we don't reach our pledge
All digital versions of the novel will be sent as soon as it is finished while anyone wanting a printed version will have to wait for a period of at least 3 months in order for us to ensure it is printed at its best and that everyone receives a quality product.",86.0,5,"1 Campaign

Agenzia Incantesimi è una serie a fumetti pubblicata gratuitamente  sull'omonima pagina (ma prossimamente si trasferirà sul sito di Verticalismi). Ne sono protagoniste Jasmine e Myriam, due ragazze che, grazie ai loro poteri magici (la prima è una potente maga, la seconda è figlia della regina del Popolo Fatato), indagano su tutti quei casi in cui sia coinvolta la magia.
Le nostre due protagoniste vivono infatti in un mondo in cui esiste la magia e tutta una serie di creature fantastiche come elfi, orchi, fate e altri ancora camminano tranquillamente in mezzo a noi. Un po' come se la Terra di Mezzo o Faerun fossero stati il nostro mondo durante il Medioevo, insomma.





LA STORIA
In questa divertente avventura, Myriam viene inviata in missione su una piccola isola greca dove gli uomini sono stati rapiti da un branco di feroci sirene.
Eccovi le prime cinque vignette. Per leggere il resto, sapete che cosa fare!


   

DI COSA ABBIAMO BISOGNO Oltre a corrispondere a Francesca Follini il giusto compenso per il suo (davvero splendido) lavoro, abbiamo un obiettivo leggermente più ambizioso, questa volta. La storia è infatti nata (ed è stata realizzata di conseguenza) per diventare un video semi-animato (per chi ha superato una certa età, intendiamo un'animazione stile il vecchio Supergulp, solo aggiornata ai tempi odierni: potete trovare molti esempi analoghi in rete). Il video, che verrà messo su Youtube nel 2016, sarà in inglese e servirà da ""trailer"" per la versione internazionale della serie, che partirà nello stesso anno.
Per quanto riguarda la cifra necessaria, sarà così suddivisa: 300€ andranno come compenso a Francesca per il suo lavoro. 200€ saranno invece destinati a coprire i costi dell'animazione del video. Gli altri 100€, infine, copriranno le percentuali di Indiegogo,di Paypal ed altre ed eventuali.
Tutto quel che arriverà in più verrà spartito fra gli autori o, se si presenterà l'occasione, sarà impiegato per ulteriori iniziative legate al video o ad Agenzia Incantesimi.
    

PERCHE' DOVRESTE AIUTARCI? E' presto detto: questa storia è destinata al video promozionale e non verrà quindi pubblicata sulla pagina di Agenzia Incantesimi. Ma chiunque contribuirà con 3 euro o più riceverà via mail, immediatamente alla scadenza della campagna, un pdf con la storia in Italiano. Sarà quindi l'unica possibilità non solo di leggere la storia nella nostra lingua, ma comunque la sola opportunità di poterla ammirare prima dell'uscita del video, il prossimo anno.   

ALTRI MODI IN CUI POTETE AIUTARCI A parte contribuire al finanziamento, potete aiutarci diffondendo questa campagna fra i vostri contatti o attraverso le vostre pagine. Anche solo per questo noi ve ne saremo grati!

Hell, I don't even want to be published to be famous. I want to be published to be recognized, and to share my ideas with the world.

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>My name is Ryan J Hodge. I’m a science fiction author, a huge fan of comics, and I’m marrying those passions with this graphic novel adaptation of my debut work, Wounded Worlds: Nihil Novum. Wounded Worlds is a fantastic military Sci-Fi tale full of compelling characters, stirring drama, and gut-wrenching moral quandaries.</p>
<p>I’m launching this campaign because this story is best told in a visual medium. With your help, we’ll do just that. This is NOT the same stale, recycled alien invasion story you’ve seen over and over. This is about characters from both sides of the conflict finding each other and whether they can reconcile what they’ve done; both to themselves and each other.</p>
<p>If you’re still not convinced, Issue #1 is already available (as of 4/15)! Just visit ryanjhodgeauthor.com and judge for yourself what I’ve accomplished so far with my own investment.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Funding this project will make Issue #2 (and subsequent issues, depending on success) possible. Included in the budget will be artist fees, marketing fund, perk distribution, and dispensation for myself to allow time off work for labor on this and other Issues (not to exceed 20% of total contributions).</p>
<p>A contribution of <u><strong>any </strong></u>amount will get you a PDF copy of Wounded Worlds: Nihil Novum (the novel).</p>
<p><strong>$10+</strong> will get you access to the Issue 2 Launch Day Live-Stream where you will be able to directly chat with me about Wounded Worlds and other projects.</p>
<p><strong>$25+</strong> will grant you a comiXology redemption code for Issues 1 &amp; 2 (when completed)</p>
<p><strong>$40+</strong> will grant you permanent access to the Launch Day Live-Streams for all subsequent issues. You will also be credited as a Major Contributor in Issue #2 and all subsequent issues.</p>
<p><strong>$100+</strong> will get you all of the above plus a signed Wounded Worlds T-Shirt of your choosing from yours truly (US Residents only).</p>
<p>If the posted goal is not met; your contribution <u>will not</u> go to waste. Issue #2 WILL come out (but it will come out faster if it’s funded).</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>There’s a lot of stale air floating around the SciFi genre. My mission is to inject a bit of fresher atmosphere and that mission is not contingent on the success of this campaign. I already offer an illustrated SciFi adventure on my website (ryanjhodgeauthor.com) for free. I’ve got stories to tell and that’s exactly what I’m going to do. With your help, I’ll tell a lot more.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Risks are minimal. I’ve already produced a couple novels and a single issue so far, so I’m familiar with the challenges of production and I have the discipline to finish difficult projects.</p>
<p>The biggest danger is that we’ll run out of funding before we run out of story. However, what has already been produced will continue to be extant; whether it’s three issues or thirteen, and increased visibility will mean increased purchases which means that the project may become self-sufficient at some point.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>You can use the Indiegogo share tools to let others know about this Campaign, of course, and you can visit ryanjhodgeauthor.com. Buy a tee or a hoodie to show some love for Wounded Worlds, check out my other stories, or just let the people of the interwebs know that you think this is a worthy project.</p>
<p>However you choose to help; thank you.</p>

<h3>THE BOOK OF RUTH</h3>
<p>I have been blessed over the course of my career to have written stories for some of the comic industry's most iconic female characters, including Wonder Woman, Catwoman, Rose, Xena, Age of Conan: Valeria, and The Little Mermaid.  But there is something special about the story of Ruth. </p>

<p>Ruth's tale chronicles one family's journey from poverty, to abundance, into poverty again, and then back to abundance.  But it is the central character of Ruth that makes this story so compelling.  Widowed as a young woman, Ruth makes the choice to leave behind everything she knows and follow her bereaved mother-in-law to Bethlehem.  While Naomi rails against God for his seeming abandonment of her family, Ruth holds only a quiet, and sincere faith that God, who she has come to know and love, has a plan.  It is her courage and unwaivering faith that shine like a beacon for all who feel lost.  Especially a retired soldier turned farmer named Boaz. </p>

<p>One of the Bible's most beautiful love stories, this 112 page graphic novel, retelling of The Book of Ruth, set during the Great Depression, is the story of one woman's journey of faith and love as you've never seen it before.

To have 100 full-color paperback printed and shipped to my address costs about $1820. It's estimated that Indiegogo fees could run up to $225, roughly 9% of funds raised. The remaining $455 we're asking goes towards shipping these books (and perks) to donors and other interested parties.
Here's a handy graph to demonstrate how the money gets used.

<p>Hey Gang,</p>
<p><br/>Thanks for looking at my project first of all. For those that don't know me, my name is Carlo Velasquez. I've been a fan of comics most of my life, and throughout my love of comics, roleplaying, gaming, general geekdom, I've always had these stories waiting to get out, whether it was work, moving to a new town, heartbreak, waiting to get better at drawing, trying to make it in music, to distract me, these stories still called out to be told. Thanks to sites like Indieagogo, it really was a no brainer to just go ahead and tell my tales!</p>
<p>With the help of a Fantastic artist Mr. Lee Borden Smith, my dream might actually be realized. And with your help I hope to share my dream with you!! This dream is to publish my stories in a serial comic book form, and maybe one day lead to bigger things in the future! I want you to join me here at the inception. Be introduced to characters and worlds that no one has ever seen. To play in my universe!</p>
This comic book will be first of many, and I know it will put a smile on your faces, and entertain you. My hope is to have you fall in love with my characters and want to spend time in the worlds that they take place in.</div>

After the tragic and sudden death of Lord Nurn, and the disappearance of his first son Jera, Nurn's youngest son Ra-Dor assumed power along with his suspected witch mother Lady Medine.

<p>I grew up reading comics titles such as 2000AD and those by Marvel UK, my favourites being Nemesis the Warlock, Transformers and Death's Head. Since then I‘ve believed that battling robots, far future spaceships travelling at astonishing speeds and scientific ventures gone wrong are some of the coolest themes possible. Throwing in some of my adult interests into the mix we get a comic series that if it were a film I could describe as:</p>
<p>'Ullysses 31 meets Transformers The Movie (1986) via Sideways'</p>
<p>I studied at Plymouth College of Art and Design and have worked on a number of small press projects including, among others, Doctor Who and 2000AD fanzines, anthology comics, and a graphic biography of James Bond creator Ian Fleming. I’ve had a number of desk jobs and I’ve also worked drawing commissioned custom comics and illustrations, sharpening my skills at likenesses by drawing pictures for those who want to see their loved ones as superheroes, Mega-City One Judges or having a cup of coffee with the Golden Girls.</p>
<p>By funding this project, contributors will help me achieve my lifelong dream of creating my own comic from start to finish, hopefully getting a few people hooked on the story along the way.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>In the far future, during the Starship Mayflower’s first incarnation as a cruise liner, holiday hologragher Jack finds himself amongst a deep criminal conspiracy when he unknowingly records evidence of the ship’s criminal element in a holographic recording of two tourists. What begins as a search for his missing photos leads him and his girlfriend Sarah deep into the Mayflower‘s underground business. Meanwhile, something weird is growing in the ship’s vineyards.</p>
<p>The two tourists provide welcome comic relief in their own travels, visiting the ship’s many wine producers.</p>
<p>Centuries later, with the ship in pirate hands, Captain Featherstone and his android second-in-command must travel deep within the vast ship - to parts not visited for centuries - to confront the mythical Green Man, who has forced the ship on a collision course with Earth. </p>
<p>And back on Earth, Helena, a rebellious young woman reluctantly accepts her destiny as the only person who can protect Earth from the incoming disaster.</p>

This campaign is for an exclusive, SIGNED copy of Kevin Eastman's Totally Twisted Tales along with a pack of cool collectibles!
This Clover Press exclusive cover for Kevin Eastman's Totally Twisted Tales is SIGNED by the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles co-creator himself, Kevin Eastman!

Kevin Eastman’s Totally Twisted Tales is 96 pages of dark and twisted depravity from the clinically insane minds of Kevin Eastman and Simon Bisley! The novella features three full length stories featuring guys, girls, monsters, mutants, superheroes, slackers and lowlifes – as well as one VERY fast rat! 
What is a graphic novella?
A graphic novella is a brand-new format created by Clover Press. Graphic Novellas are trade paperbacks that feel like hardcovers. What's even better than that? They're offered at an amazing price!

Why are we here?
We want to show off our brand-new format, offer some amazing perks, and meet some fans!
If you support this project and agree that the graphic novella is a great way to binge comics, we'll be able to make more awesome sets like this in the future!

Who - or what - is beating the cops to the punch? One guess...

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is <strong>M.A.O Hadji</strong>, and I'm a London based author and illustrator with a life-long wish to create an epic space-opera comic book series originating from the wild imagination of my mind, and inspired by the established staple series of the genre such as Star Wars and Firefly.</p>

</div></div>","The Story


My
name is R.B. and I'm a comic artist from the Seattle area. 



Last
year I printed 100 copies of my first graphic novel thanks to good
luck, hard work, and many generous donations. Being an artist isn't easy, but the
Internet came through for me and made a long time dream possible.


Now
it's con season again and I don't have enough books to spread out
between all the conventions I have planned. I'm not only planning to
come out with a re-print of my first graphic novel, I'm planning to
release a whole new book and new merchandise. 



This
project would be impossible without help from the community and I
hope that this years donation run is just as successful as the one before it. 


The Impact



If
I get fully funded I'll be able to purchase more books for
conventions, and my books will go up for consignment in
Seattle comic shops. More outreach means more readers, which means a
better chance at making this part time job a full time job. 



If
things don't get funded? 



I'll have a convention table at ECCC, and hardly anything to sell. If I don't sell enough I
may not have enough money to fund a convention in June, which leads
to the horror of being left with zero merchandise and no way to make
more. It would be crippling. 



What We Need & What You Get



Here
is the breakdown of my current budget. 


Partners
2nd Ed. 


Cost
for 100 books 685.00

Thieves
#1 


Cost
for 100 books: 300$ 


Buttons:



1.5in
packaged buttons:

100
buttons w/packaging = 208.00



This
is about 1,200 total in merchandise. Not including the cost of the
mini that I'm collaborating on. The rest of the money will go toward any
unseen expenses and travel expenses. Anything beyond that will
continue to go toward travel expenses as I'll be heading to the east
coast for my second convention. 


This
isn't just a donation, it's a pre-order. The more you give,
the more you get. From comics and pins to garish coffee mugs. 

No tote bags though.

Like a lot of ideas in their infancy, I just couldn’t get it out of my head. Creating a “non-apocalyptic” end of the world tale. One where there is no external threat; i.e -  zombies, aliens, nuclear winter. Instead I wanted to tell a story where people simply lost their humanity. What if the majority of the people in the world simply ceased being human? What would we be left with? Would the minority left behind become peaceful? War-like? Would the people left even want to remain? How would the minority left behind treat those who had lost their humanity?  These questions and thoughts were the basis for the story behind The Nobodies. Another heavy influence for the themes of the story came from The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoevsky.</p><p>Running with my non-apocalypse theme, I wanted to litter my world with interesting concepts and characters. With Iggy being the character we all see this different world through. I then crafted a story that saw Iggy being connected to this world in unusual ways, with his past being a central mystery to the tale. As you can see by the cover above, marijuana plays a factor in the world of The Nobodies. The story takes place 20 years after the initial event, “the Rapture”, which saw billions of people lose their humanity overnight. Instead of focusing directly on the event, I wanted to focus the story on a society rebounding from the event. Marijuana plays a key factor in society's recovery.</p><p>After developing the initial ideas behind the story, I set out to write the script. It was definitely a trying and learned experience, all helped by the editorial skills of Steven Forbes. You can read about Steven above in the creative team section. He not only helped with editing the script  for The Nobodies but helped me with other aspects of the project. He has an extensive knowledge base when it comes to developing a comic book project, and his guidance was invaluable.</p><p>Ger Curti was an easy find. I sent out feelers to various places, and the moment I saw Ger’s work, I knew he was a perfect fit for The Nobodies. Ger took the script I had written and created a wonderfully dark, and imaginative world. Coupled with Ariel’s greyscale work,  both artists brought The Nobodies to life the way I had in my mind for years.</p><p>Upon completion, I released the comic book as a PDF. After a couple of months it released on Comixology, where it has 4 Stars on five reivews.  It received good sales, and the critics enjoyed it as you can tell from the reviews below. The next step was to print the book and sell physical copies. This step was definitely the biggest struggle. I reached out to some publishers and found one I made a deal with, however, they fell through before the book could be printed. This campaign, and in turn you, is how I wanted to fund the printing in the first place. I’ve always liked the idea of crowd-funding, there’s something about people actively supporting a concept and being a part of making it happen that feels so refreshing. No matter how much you donate, you’ll be helping complete a project that has been years in the making, and I can’t thank you enough.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/494339/files/20140408182147-reviews.jpg?1397006507"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p>""<i>Vinson and the other creators have put together something truly intriguing here, and a title I’m looking forward to reading more of as soon as it becomes available.</i>” - <a href=""http://bigcomicpage.com/2014/02/26/ceej-says-the-nobodies-1-review/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">BigComicPage.com</a></p><p> ""<i>John and his team have an interesting gem on their hands.

He wanders outside into a different world than he saw last. Lifeless people known as the Nobodies roam the streets. Iggy runs into a group of survivors who explain to him what is going on. What follows is action, mystery, and suspense and some dark humor. The concept sounds familiar, but Vinson and artist Ger Curti put a great amount of detail into the world Iggy now inhabits. Vinson also peppers the comic book with storytelling that will get you talking.</p><p>The first thing I had to ask Vinson about was the cover. The one with the giant marijuana leaf on it. It definitely is an eye catcher and is one of the things that makes the comic stand out.</p><p>Here is my interview with John Vinson. Enjoy!</p><p><b>Steve Hash</b>: You look at the cover here and right off the bat, amongst the great artwork is a giant marijuana leaf...</p><p><b>John Vinson</b>: (Laughs) Yeah, There it is. It's pretty apparent.</p><p></p><p><b>SH</b>: One question that comes to mind is the comic being used in anyway, even in small ways, to comment on politics of marijuana?</p><p><b>JV</b>: Um, not the politics really. It's basically... the marijuana aspect, it's a part of this world now in a different way than we know of. Because in this world, there is no law. There is nothing to say that marijuana is wrong. There is nothing to say that this is wrong or that is wrong. Which, you know, is pretty standard with any post apocalyptic tale. I guess the marijuana for me was the way to say, without the law to say that this is wrong, it could just as easily become a staple of society as it could be seen as detrimental. You know like alcohol!  Alcohol is a part of our society. It's legal. There are bars. There are places you can go to drink this alcohol.</p><p><b>SH</b>: Well even alcohol was illegal at one point....</p><p><b>JV</b>: Even that was illegal! Right? They turned that around... it is so arbitrary in a lot of ways. But in this world, marijuana is actually a currency. I don't really dive into a lot of that in the first issue. I think the only marijuana use in issue one is Tom and Dr. Edeman smoke a joint and pass it back and forth with each other. But you'll see more of it as the book goes on. That is just kinda the details of the world I wanted to establish. Marijuana is very prevalent. Everyone smokes it. Everyone is fine with it. It has become a part of society.</p><p><b>SH</b>: Do politics in general even enter into the the theme of the comic?  </p><p><b>JV</b>: Politics some. It's not the main drive of the book. There are going to be a couple of storylines later on in the book... it is a seven issue miniseries. So I think around issue three or four, there is going to be a little more politics involved. I don't want to dive into that too much, but it does get somewhat involved but nothing heavy handed really.</p><p><b>SH</b>: So how did this idea come to you? Where did the story come from?</p><p><b>JV</b>: Actually, it was started by two things. First would be a book called The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. I highly recommend it. To me it is the greatest piece of fiction ever and there is a chapter in the book where they talk about humanity and the loss of it. One of the chapters in that book is called ""The Devil. Ivan's Nightmare.' One of the characters, whose name is Ivan, has a hallucination of Satan. It talks about how Satan uses out aspects of humanity against us. That was kind of what drove me to write this book because the essence is about humanity. What makes us human. What are the negative things that makes us human? What are the positive things? If you take that all away, what are you left with?</p><p><b>SH</b>: That is fascinating. Was this always going to be a comic book? Or did you have something else in mind?</p><p><b>JV</b>: Yeah it was always going to be a comic book. It's funny another inspiration was Led Zeppelin's ""Dancing Days."" That is where I got the idea that I didn't want to do zombies because to me... I didn't want the threat to be the undead. I didn't want it to be something supernatural.</p><p><b>SH</b>: That actually was going to be a question I had. Where did the idea for the Nobodies themselves come from?</p><p><b>JV</b>: It came from when I was actually listening to ""Dancing Days."" It's weird, it actually came when I was listening to music. It didn't come to me when I was reading a story, or watching a movie, or watching a television show. It happened while I was listening to this song. It made me think, the Dancing Days: You are having fun and it's free spirited, all these positive emotions. What would happen if all these emotions got taken away? All the emotions gone from a person. Like what if I am sitting across from a person. You know, I am not sad or happy or angry. I am just sitting here. Nothing is looking back at you.</p><p><b>SH</b>: It almost would be traumatizing.</p><p><b>JV</b>: Exactly! It is! Funny you say that because part of that comes into play too about how people react to the Nobodies when the Rapture happens which is the event that they call it in the book.</p><p><b>SH</b>: You said that there are seven issues, are we ever going to see the actual ""rapture"" happen? It's mentioned obviously.</p><p><b>JV</b>: No. This takes place 20 years after the event.</p><p><b>SH</b>: So might we see flashbacks or anything like that?</p><p><b>JV</b>: There might be flashback maybe. I think most of the flashbacks if they happen are going to be mentioned in the POTUS letter. Whoever has read the comic and seen the POTUS letter at the beginning, he actually is a character in the comic and he will talk about it and flesh out the world a little more. I have a couple of ideas for flashback stories later on. For the most part, I am not going to dive too much into the details. I am going to focus more on the world as it is now.</p><p><b>SH</b>: So you come up with the idea of the comic, how did you go about funding it? Because self starting your own comic book has become a thing here lately. How did the process go?</p><p><b>JV</b>: A lot of savings. A lot of... praying. (Laughs). Let me tell you one thing about comic making is that it is very expensive.</p><p><b>SH</b>: Really? What's the ballpark figure on making one?</p><p>JV: Well if you don't do the art yourself, and you find a competent artist and a competent inker. Without coloring, $1,500 to $2,000. And that is if you are doing a single issue, which is usually 20-22 pages. For me it was pencils, inks, and grayscale.</p><p><b>SH</b>: You planned for the no color then?</p><p><b>JV</b>: Yeah. That decision wasn't made from the funding. It was made because I didn't think the story required color. I didn't think color would help it. It is not a very vibrant world. Like when you are reading Superman. You wouldn't want to read a black and white Superman book. To me, a lot of stories don't require color. I did grayscaling because I wanted to give it more depth. I looked at the inks and there just wasn't a depth on the pages. I gave it a little bit of gray scale just to kind of give the world a bit more layer to it.</p><p><b>SH</b>: So who is the artist? How did you hire them?</p><p><b>JV</b>: I put out a advertisement for this website called Digital Webbing (<a href=""http://www.digitalwebbing.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.digitalwebbing.com</a>). I highly recommend it if you are ever looking for artists. If you ever post there, you'll receive hundreds of postings there and they all want to work for you of course. So I posted it there, and I was going through the submissions and right off the bat you can just see... you know (shakes his head no)... and some people are good but they just don't fit your style. But with Ger (Curti, the artist for the Nobodies), it's funny in that you don't think with an artist that there is going to be so much back and forth, but you really want someone to get the gist of your book. So it was down between him and a couple of other artists and so I talked to each of them and kinda got their take on the book and if they were into it or not. But Ger and I clicked together right off the bat.</p><p><b>SH</b>: Was it his art that just popped right out at you?</p><p><b>JV</b>: Oh yeah! When you send out advertisements for these artists on the website, they'll send you something right back that they have worked on. Most of it is stuff that you know won't work at all but with Ger's stuff, I couldn't get it out of my head. You know, it is like with anything artistic that you like, it clicks. You don't think about it too much. It just works.</p><p><b>SH</b>: So where is the story going to go? Is it going to go worldwide? Because in the first issue here, it pretty much stays in Buffalo, NY for the most part. Do you see it go to somewhere like London? Could we see this from a worldwide perspective?</p><p><b>JV</b>: This actually is a tough question to answer. I can't give specifics because a lot of the places that Iggy and the other characters travel to are actually part of the story. So I don't wanna give away any of the story but I can tell you it definitely expands beyond Buffalo. I can give you a little more insight into the next issue. What's going to happen is that there is going to be a lot of violence in the next issue. A lot of movement in terms of things that are going to happen to the characters. So it is going to be... the second issue is going to be much more action packed. It definitely gets bigger that is for sure.</p><p><b>SH</b>: So what is next? You said that there is seven issues but what is next after you finish this run? You got any other comics planned out ot any other ideas?</p><p><b>JV</b>: I do have a couple of ideas for sure...</p><p><b>SH</b>: What kind of genre you thinking about doing?</p><p><b>JV</b>: Superheroes. I can say that. It's funny though. As hard as it is just to get one issue done, I can't even fathom.... unless this takes off where I can do it full time... fathom what the next series is going to be. But I do have some ideas to keep things going beyond The Nobodies that is for sure.</p><p><b>SH</b>: Cool thanks very much.</p><b>JV</b>: Thank you!<br/><p></p></div>","Issue #1 - The Great Pasture MartPOTus Letter (Prologue Letters For Each Issue) You can view the letter in its full size here.Series SummaryThe Nobodies is a series that focuses on what would happen after an apocalypse that provides no physical catastrophic event.

Coupled with Ariel’s greyscale work,  both artists brought The Nobodies to life the way I had in my mind for years.Upon completion, I released the comic book as a PDF. After a couple of months it released on Comixology, where it has 4 Stars on five reivews.  It received good sales, and the critics enjoyed it as you can tell from the reviews below. The next step was to print the book and sell physical copies. This step was definitely the biggest struggle. I reached out to some publishers and found one I made a deal with, however, they fell through before the book could be printed. This campaign, and in turn you, is how I wanted to fund the printing in the first place. I’ve always liked the idea of crowd-funding, there’s something about people actively supporting a concept and being a part of making it happen that feels so refreshing. No matter how much you donate, you’ll be helping complete a project that has been years in the making, and I can’t thank you enough.""Vinson and the other creators have put together something truly intriguing here, and a title I’m looking forward to reading more of as soon as it becomes available.” - BigComicPage.com ""John and his team have an interesting gem on their hands. Page by page John displays a solid grasp of comic book story telling that made it a joy to read. The choice of revealing Iggy’s identity late was smart and John’s display of suspense building and establishing mystery along with using clues given to strengthen his story were phenomenal. John has much potential in the world of comics. Ger’s artwork has a bit of grime that resembles what I would expect of The Walking Dead which adds a flair of filth needed to truly get our cast. Easily this comic is a must read for comic fans and while it won’t change the medium it is exactly the kind of story that is missing; an honest, throat grabbing draw into an unknown world."" - ImpulseGamer ""I think Vinson made a good choice in getting all the ideas out there and hoping he can intrigue readers with some of the notions he’s come up with. It’s got me interested in seeing more. Now it will be a matter of seeing how the creative team can develop and explore these ideas as they build the story and further flesh out the world they’ve introduced."" ComicsSpectrumDigitalHere is what various reader reviews of the digital version have said:""Hey just purchased and read The Nobodies comic, I love the artwork and the story line is very interesting.""""Orision is a good read I loved it along with The Nobodies which has a unique storyline!""""I personally liked The Nobodies as well great comic John!""A Q&A, providing more insight into the comic book, you can find the website here Set in the future, The Nobodies is about a man named Iggy who wakes up in a garage, attached to all sorts of medical equipment. He wanders outside into a different world than he saw last. Lifeless people known as the Nobodies roam the streets. Iggy runs into a group of survivors who explain to him what is going on. What follows is action, mystery, and suspense and some dark humor. The concept sounds familiar, but Vinson and artist Ger Curti put a great amount of detail into the world Iggy now inhabits. Vinson also peppers the comic book with storytelling that will get you talking.The first thing I had to ask Vinson about was the cover. The one with the giant marijuana leaf on it. It definitely is an eye catcher and is one of the things that makes the comic stand out.Here is my interview with John Vinson. Enjoy!Steve Hash: You look at the cover here and right off the bat, amongst the great artwork is a giant marijuana leaf...John Vinson: (Laughs) Yeah, There it is. It's pretty apparent.SH: One question that comes to mind is the comic being used in anyway, even in small ways, to comment on politics of marijuana?JV: Um, not the politics really. It's basically... the marijuana aspect, it's a part of this world now in a different way than we know of. Because in this world, there is no law. There is nothing to say that marijuana is wrong. There is nothing to say that this is wrong or that is wrong. Which, you know, is pretty standard with any post apocalyptic tale. I guess the marijuana for me was the way to say, without the law to say that this is wrong, it could just as easily become a staple of society as it could be seen as detrimental. You know like alcohol!  Alcohol is a part of our society. It's legal. There are bars. There are places you can go to drink this alcohol.SH: Well even alcohol was illegal at one point....JV: Even that was illegal! Right? They turned that around... it is so arbitrary in a lot of ways. But in this world, marijuana is actually a currency. I don't really dive into a lot of that in the first issue. I think the only marijuana use in issue one is Tom and Dr. Edeman smoke a joint and pass it back and forth with each other. But you'll see more of it as the book goes on. That is just kinda the details of the world I wanted to establish. Marijuana is very prevalent. Everyone smokes it. Everyone is fine with it. It has become a part of society.SH: Do politics in general even enter into the the theme of the comic?  JV: Politics some. It's not the main drive of the book. There are going to be a couple of storylines later on in the book... it is a seven issue miniseries. So I think around issue three or four, there is going to be a little more politics involved. I don't want to dive into that too much, but it does get somewhat involved but nothing heavy handed really.SH: So how did this idea come to you? Where did the story come from?JV: Actually, it was started by two things. First would be a book called The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. I highly recommend it. To me it is the greatest piece of fiction ever and there is a chapter in the book where they talk about humanity and the loss of it. One of the chapters in that book is called ""The Devil. Ivan's Nightmare.' One of the characters, whose name is Ivan, has a hallucination of Satan. It talks about how Satan uses out aspects of humanity against us. That was kind of what drove me to write this book because the essence is about humanity. What makes us human. What are the negative things that makes us human? What are the positive things? If you take that all away, what are you left with?SH: That is fascinating. Was this always going to be a comic book? Or did you have something else in mind?JV: Yeah it was always going to be a comic book. It's funny another inspiration was Led Zeppelin's ""Dancing Days."" That is where I got the idea that I didn't want to do zombies because to me... I didn't want the threat to be the undead. I didn't want it to be something supernatural.SH: That actually was going to be a question I had. Where did the idea for the Nobodies themselves come from?JV: It came from when I was actually listening to ""Dancing Days."" It's weird, it actually came when I was listening to music. It didn't come to me when I was reading a story, or watching a movie, or watching a television show. It happened while I was listening to this song. It made me think, the Dancing Days: You are having fun and it's free spirited, all these positive emotions. What would happen if all these emotions got taken away? All the emotions gone from a person. Like what if I am sitting across from a person. You know, I am not sad or happy or angry. I am just sitting here. Nothing is looking back at you.SH: It almost would be traumatizing.JV: Exactly! It is! Funny you say that because part of that comes into play too about how people react to the Nobodies when the Rapture happens which is the event that they call it in the book.SH: You said that there are seven issues, are we ever going to see the actual ""rapture"" happen? It's mentioned obviously.JV: No. This takes place 20 years after the event.SH: So might we see flashbacks or anything like that?JV: There might be flashback maybe. I think most of the flashbacks if they happen are going to be mentioned in the POTUS letter. Whoever has read the comic and seen the POTUS letter at the beginning, he actually is a character in the comic and he will talk about it and flesh out the world a little more. I have a couple of ideas for flashback stories later on. For the most part, I am not going to dive too much into the details. I am going to focus more on the world as it is now.SH: So you come up with the idea of the comic, how did you go about funding it? Because self starting your own comic book has become a thing here lately. How did the process go?JV: A lot of savings. A lot of... praying. (Laughs). Let me tell you one thing about comic making is that it is very expensive.SH: Really? What's the ballpark figure on making one?JV: Well if you don't do the art yourself, and you find a competent artist and a competent inker. Without coloring, $1,500 to $2,000. And that is if you are doing a single issue, which is usually 20-22 pages. For me it was pencils, inks, and grayscale.SH: You planned for the no color then?JV: Yeah. That decision wasn't made from the funding. It was made because I didn't think the story required color. I didn't think color would help it. It is not a very vibrant world. Like when you are reading Superman. You wouldn't want to read a black and white Superman book. To me, a lot of stories don't require color. I did grayscaling because I wanted to give it more depth. I looked at the inks and there just wasn't a depth on the pages. I gave it a little bit of gray scale just to kind of give the world a bit more layer to it.SH: So who is the artist? How did you hire them?JV: I put out a advertisement for this website called Digital Webbing (www.digitalwebbing.com). I highly recommend it if you are ever looking for artists. If you ever post there, you'll receive hundreds of postings there and they all want to work for you of course. So I posted it there, and I was going through the submissions and right off the bat you can just see... you know (shakes his head no)... and some people are good but they just don't fit your style. But with Ger (Curti, the artist for the Nobodies), it's funny in that you don't think with an artist that there is going to be so much back and forth, but you really want someone to get the gist of your book. So it was down between him and a couple of other artists and so I talked to each of them and kinda got their take on the book and if they were into it or not. But Ger and I clicked together right off the bat.SH: Was it his art that just popped right out at you?JV: Oh yeah! When you send out advertisements for these artists on the website, they'll send you something right back that they have worked on. Most of it is stuff that you know won't work at all but with Ger's stuff, I couldn't get it out of my head. You know, it is like with anything artistic that you like, it clicks. You don't think about it too much. It just works.SH: So where is the story going to go? Is it going to go worldwide? Because in the first issue here, it pretty much stays in Buffalo, NY for the most part. Do you see it go to somewhere like London? Could we see this from a worldwide perspective?JV: This actually is a tough question to answer. I can't give specifics because a lot of the places that Iggy and the other characters travel to are actually part of the story. So I don't wanna give away any of the story but I can tell you it definitely expands beyond Buffalo. I can give you a little more insight into the next issue. What's going to happen is that there is going to be a lot of violence in the next issue. A lot of movement in terms of things that are going to happen to the characters. So it is going to be... the second issue is going to be much more action packed. It definitely gets bigger that is for sure.SH: So what is next? You said that there is seven issues but what is next after you finish this run? You got any other comics planned out ot any other ideas?JV: I do have a couple of ideas for sure...SH: What kind of genre you thinking about doing?JV: Superheroes. I can say that. It's funny though. As hard as it is just to get one issue done, I can't even fathom.... unless this takes off where I can do it full time... fathom what the next series is going to be. But I do have some ideas to keep things going beyond The Nobodies that is for sure.SH: Cool thanks very much.JV: Thank you!",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

I forgot to introduce myself, didn't I? Sorry about that, I'm just too excited!My name is Dave Brink.  I live in the Netherlands with the love of my life Edith, and my fuzzy feline friend Thibeaux.  The book I'm presenting to you today is actually my third creator owned title.  I've ran successful crowdfunding campaigns for my other two comic series (Earthling, and Dreamgirl: Sleeper Agent), but this is my first time on IndieGoGo.


Lettering by Hde
The idea for Perfect 10 came to me back in the nineties, an era wherein comics had never been cooler. Well, to me at least. That, plus I was a huge fan of Tomb Raider. What a time to be alive!

Anyway, the initial premise was fairly simple; what if Lara Croft had to fight actual comic book supervillains? Who doesn't want to see that?!

Somehow I got the opportunity to do a project with artist Pow Rodrix (Wolverine, The Avengers, Justice League of America), and I knew Perfect 10 was it. This book had to happen!


We brought on board color wizard Daniel Rodrigues, who is one of the nicest guys I know, and lettering veteran Hde, whose professional input is always invaluable. Not much of Hde's work is shown on these preview pages, but that's only because I don't want to potentially spoil important story elements. The full experience is in the printed book!

While the comic was in production, guest artists delivered promotional material and pin-ups.I don't want our backers to miss out on all this awesomeness, so I decided that everyone gets everything. This means no variant covers, no mini-posters, no separate prints; except for pre-production sketches, the book will contain every piece of final artwork!

Get a one and only ORIGINAL Pow Rodrix sequential page from Perfect 10, drawn on 11,7 x 16,5 inch Off-set board! After the campaign ends you'll be able to PICK THE PAGE you like to receive, IF that page is still available. Limited to 10 backers!

If you missed out on any of my previous campaigns or you're curious about the other titles, here's the opportunity to get up to speed! (Earthling issue 4, and Dreamgirl: Sleeper Agent need to be reprinted, so they'll become available once we reach our funding goal. You can adjust your order to include them when they're unlocked.)
Finally
I work without a publisher. All orders I'll be shipping out personally. Everyone will be receiving their digital rewards the same week the campaign ends. Physical books and art will be bagged and boarded as soon as possible.Feel free to contact me with any questions about your order. I'm happy to be of assistance!(I'm also on Facebook and Instagram!)Lastly I like to thank everyone for taking a look at this campaign. This has been a dream project, and with your support we'll be able to continue the adventures of Perfect 10 for the coming years!But most importantly, please stay safe and take care of each other.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Tania Lacy; mother, wife, writer and comedian. My career in entertainment spans some 30 years. I started as a dancer (yes, that is me in Kylie Minogue's 'Locomotion') then landed a job on TV. I quickly became a household name, delivering my own brand of off-beat, subversive comedy.</p>
<p>There have been many successes (and failures) since those heady days on TV in the late 80's. I've written and performed live shows, prize winning short films, I've penned two books and also written for film and television. In 2018, I returned to the stage performing standup comedy in Berlin.  I thought my performing days were behind me but no, seems I still have plenty to say and audiences still find me funny, but most importantly, I still love it! It also seems the world is far more accepting of the many strong, brave and often rebellious women who are getting on stage and making people laugh.  </p>
<p>So... I have decided to relaunch myself into this exciting new world order with a brand new show! A show entitled 'Catch A Falling Star'.  But to do this, I need financial support. </p>
<p>With your contributions, I will be able to perform at the Brighton and Edinburgh Fringe Festivals and I'll be able to do it right. These festivals are highly regarded and performing here can lead to many other opportunities. Your contributions would enable me to focus on creating a great show and to get it in front of an international audience. In essence, you will be helping me take my career to an exciting new level. Having your support would mean the world to me. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need to raise 8000 Aussie dollars  to get this show to the Brighton and Edinburgh Fringe Festivals. It's a lot of money, I know. Normally, these would be costs absorbed by a producer. Alas, my time away from the stage makes finding a producer difficult. </p>
<p>The costs of mounting a show at Brighton and Edinburgh Fringe Festivals includes: (all costs converted to AUD)</p>
<p>REGISTRATION FEES - Brighton $344.13    Edinburgh $577.79</p>
<p>VENUE FEES - Brighton (@ 10% projected ticket sales) $1324    Edinburgh $746.92</p>
<p>FLIGHTS - TXL - LHR $177    TXL - EDI $235</p>
<p>PUBLICITY/MARKETING - Posters &amp; Leaflets $300    Publicist    $2300</p>
<p>ACCOMMODATION - Brighton $807    Edinburgh $1870</p>
<p>CONTINGENCY - @ 10% of budget $868.94</p>
<p><strong>GRAND TOTAL - $9548.94</strong></p>
<p>As you can see, it all adds up. I recognise that there are many more people out there who need this money more than me, especially at this time of the year. That's why I will give one dollar of every ten I raise to the Salvation Army Christmas Appeal.  I will provide receipt of donation at the conclusion of the campaign.</p>
<p>So what's in it for you? Well, apart from my undying love for you, I can offer free tickets to the show in Brighton and Edinburgh. Given these places are so far away, that's probably not going to be much recompense for my lovely donators. I would therefore be happy to offer small acts of kindness. Perhaps you want an autographed photo?  Perhaps you'd like me to call you or a friend to say' Happy Birthday'?  I can do that. All reasonable requests will be considered. And updates, of course there will be updates, as we take this journey together. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your donation will help me take this next step in my career. You will be helping me personally and professionally. I'm happier when I'm performing but more importantly, I believe I make others happier when they're laughing along with me.</p>
<p>I had great success with my last show in Edinburgh and I'm hoping to repeat that, only this time bigger and better. And with the wisdom I've gained from age and experience, I feel better able to capitalise on the success of the show. </p>
<p>I really hope you will join me for the ride.   </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are risks in any undertaking, the biggest and one most of us fear is failure. And there's every chance I could fail but, I've never let fear stop me before. I can make this promise to you, my investors. I will tirelessly promote the show, I will pound the pavement, handing out leaflets, doing whatever I can to ensure your money is not wasted. Damn it, I'm going to do whatever I can to lessen any risks. This will be my challenge.  </p>
<h3>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</h3>
</div><div>
<p>If it's not possible for you to donate, please help me by spreading the word. Make some noise about my campaign. Use the Indiegogo share tools. Any and all support is greatly appreciated.</p>

<h3><i>A Supernatural Dream In The Making!</i></h3>
<p><strong>THE CAPTIVATING LIGHT</strong> is a supernatural story of a Miami teenpreneur and his friends who create startups, attend a pioneering school, and uncover a vile trafficking ring that plagues South Florida. Legend unlocks a celestial armor by connecting his cross necklace on the front of his pocket Bible. Before he knows it, he finds himself in an inescapable supernatural journey through the physical and metaphysical worlds.</p>
<p>The Soterian armor was created by the Eternal Existence and Legend is the first one to don the celestial armor. The suit is eternal in nature which allows for travel between dimensions and worlds, weapons to materialize from the metaphysical to the physical, and for him to enter into Isolato (isolation into the spirit realm/think Avatar).</p>

<p> </p>
<p>With other heroes already in the Limelight Verse, Legend believes the armor can help shed light into the darkness of the world and bring about permanent change. However, two of his friends are unaware of his new abilities while the new girl has moved from over 3,000 miles into a Miami culture, which she is unfamiliar with. Together they are set out to make big changes in the physical and metaphysical world.</p>

His personal mission is to rescue his parents from government agents, but that objective is often frustrated with the likes of giant monsters, super-villains, and even the armed forces.The comic takes a contemporary look at the question, ""What does it mean to be truly free?""HISTORY: Voluntaryist was created by liberty fanatic and producer Jack L., whose passion for liberty is only matched by his passion for memes and production. He began the long process of creating the series while trudging through his graduate studies.The Voluntaryist comic series was in a prototyping process for 6 years and is now showcasing the canon origins story.

El atentado “de fogueo” al monarca y un posterior comunicado grabado en vídeo y divulgado por internet otorga al grupo una inesperada repercusión mediática que les anima a salir del anonimato y crear, junto a otras formaciones políticas, el MTL, ""Movimiento Tudmirio de Liberación"", para reivindicar la independencia del Levante español, recuperando la memoria histórica de Tudmir, primer estado independiente de Europa que en el año 714 comprendía las provincias de Murcia, Albacete, Alicante y Almería, y del Cánton Murciano que en 1873 logró la independencia de España, acuñando su propia moneda. Liderados por el carismático Jerónimo Balibrea, el MTL gana con mayoría absoluta las elecciones autonómicas de 2015 y el sueño independentista levantino se consolida a partir de la aparición inesperada de un fenómeno paranormal en el chalet adosado de una urbanización inacabada de Torre Pacheco. En poco tiempo, las originales iniciativas del Presidente de Tudmiria, superan en rigor histórico y sentimiento popular, a las aspiraciones de los separatistas de Cataluña.




Revolución de 1873 por la que el Cantón Murciano logra la independencia de España  y resiste heroicamente los bombardeos de los buques españoles durante seis meses antes de ser derrotados.

Some know each other well, others have even been enemies, and one particular wizard of interest is a stranger of completely unknown origin.

I had originally wanted to be an illustrator, but over time, I fell more-and-more in love with writing. I had wanted to try making a novel out of this place I had created but I just couldn’t find the right story to do it. It took about five or six years before I finally came up with an idea that I truly believed in and could really pour myself into.</i></p><p><i>Ultimately, I found the more I was willing to express myself through my characters, the easier the story became to write.

This was one of the most challenging aspects of writing the books because I had to change so many things throughout the series simultaneously, but the benefit is, as you progress through it, you can reread any of the volumes at any time and see things that you may have missed before. To me, this makes the series infinitely more enjoyable because you will always be finding something new as you revisit it.</i></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462744977/27_wtgpdg.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div><br/></div><p>If you have read this far, you have my thanks!  I hope we have managed to catch your interest and feel free to visit us at our websites where you can get more up-to-date pictures and information!  </p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>Risks and challenges</h3><p>Nearly everything is made locally, so the only foreseeable problem we could encounter is a minor delay in shipping.

Perhaps the land still has many secrets hidden in its valleys and forests?That statement couldn’t be any truer. In a sense, Calaway is a character of its own. It has a history that extends beyond what its inhabitants know, and each race, kingdom and location holds secrets that will continuously come into play. The more the readers come to understand the lore and mysteries of the island, the more they will begin to form opinions of their own as to what things mean and where the story is headed.Is Calaway a place of magic?Magic is one of the greatest components of Grinidon. The series is actually named after a tower that houses a secret assembly of wizards – the most powerful magic users in the realm. During the story, you find out who these characters are and why they have come together. Each is very unique in both personality, and how they have chosen to use their power. Some know each other well, others have even been enemies, and one particular wizard of interest is a stranger of completely unknown origin. This makes for a very interesting dynamic and allows the reader to learn more about magic and the realm through the character’s interactions.You’ve spent three years working on turning this story into a graphic novel. What inspired Grinidon?When I was about thirteen-years-old, I began to slowly piece this world together. I had originally wanted to be an illustrator, but over time, I fell more-and-more in love with writing. I had wanted to try making a novel out of this place I had created but I just couldn’t find the right story to do it. It took about five or six years before I finally came up with an idea that I truly believed in and could really pour myself into.Ultimately, I found the more I was willing to express myself through my characters, the easier the story became to write. Symptomatically, as I became more personally invested in the story, it also made it much more interesting and meaningful to work on.This is why I am so passionate about this story and project, because it is very much a part of who I am. This has kept me from taking shortcuts in regards to plot and development, and really stay true to my vision and remain loyal to the reader. I hope people are able to identify with these characters and circumstances, and find value and meaning as well as entertainment.As the author, is there anything in particular about the series that you would like the readers to be aware of?I think one of the greatest strengths of this series is that since I have written so much of the story already, I have been able to include small clues and various pieces of information in earlier volumes that won’t immediately be obvious – or even recognizable at all. This was one of the most challenging aspects of writing the books because I had to change so many things throughout the series simultaneously, but the benefit is, as you progress through it, you can reread any of the volumes at any time and see things that you may have missed before. To me, this makes the series infinitely more enjoyable because you will always be finding something new as you revisit it.If you have read this far, you have my thanks!  I hope we have managed to catch your interest and feel free to visit us at our websites where you can get more up-to-date pictures and information!  Risks and challengesNearly everything is made locally, so the only foreseeable problem we could encounter is a minor delay in shipping.

And <b>I'm Tanner Simmons</b>, a recent graduate from the College for Creative Studies in Detroit, Michigan. I'm an illustrator and writer who finds inspiration not only in the stories I continue to experience every day, but the stories of others that I cross paths with. Human themes fill my work, whether it's a story of pure fantasy or something that draws heavily from real-life. Everything I do as an artist draws from a feeling or a place I've been before, even in minute ways. However, Jim is a special case of this philosophy in practice.<br/> <p><b>This Is Jim</b> is a book I finished writing and illustrating earlier this year, and a project I've been extremely enthusiastic about since I first starting working on it. This book tells the story of our titular character Jim, as he navigates through his own memories; recalling seemingly random and out-of-order events that have occurred in his life. Many of these memories are normal, mundane happenings that most of us tend to ignore or take for granted on a day-to-day basis, but are vivid recollections in Jim's mind. He is naive, but also wonderfully curious about the littlest details in the world around him, and that's what the book is really about: <i>the little details</i>.</p>
<p>This book holds a lot of sentimental and cathartic value for me, as it draws from many of my own experiences but also the experiences of friends, acquaintances and even complete strangers. I believe it also holds many stories that other individuals can relate to as well though, and this is why I'm launching this crowd-funding project through Indiegogo. With your support, I intend to jump-start the first run of physically printed This Is Jim 172-page paperback and hardcover books so that I can get these stories and feelings into the hands of others, <i>literally.</i></p>
<p>My hope is that through the success of this campaign I will be able to sell additional copies of this book and fund the future of Jim's artistic partnership with me. I certainly have more stories to tell with him, and would love to expand on this concept with more books and other illustrative efforts. With your help, this is a grand possibility.</p>

<p>My name is <b>German Andino</b>. I’m a Honduran artist/journalist. Let me tell you what this project is about…</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1279453/files/20150308193913-leadCampa_aInglesTitulo.jpg?1425868753"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p></p>
<p>The statistics, with all the weight of their inaccuracy, until 2014 said that Honduras was the most violent country in the world and the media has repeated it to the point where our 103 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants are a useless data point. Ten, fifteen, nineteen homicides  a day, it’s all the same now. It’s been repeated so much that it dulls its impact. </p>
<p>The country has turned into a cold sample space, a sterile land that produces little more than bananas. One that lends itself to reporters that pass through quickly and with great care. “Honduras is hell! Look!”</p>
<p>This comic tries to do the opposite: walk you through the feared streets of Honduras and pat your back while your heartbeat slows down to give you a look at the people who aren’t news, those of us who are still alive; like the crime journalist in the first chapter, or the cocaine dealer who wants to be like Daddy Yankee in the next one.</p>
<p>There are no statistics that can count the pools of blood you have to step through or the bursts of AK-47 fire that from far away can make you choke on your dinner or sing you to sleep at night. Just like no one can weigh the cocaine that, sprinkled along the ground, marks the narco-trafficker´s route to North America. Daily life doesn’t appear in headlines and even the world’s most seasoned war reporter doesn’t capture it in a two-week trip here.</p>
<p>Sometimes – too many times for my 30 years – I see a body on the corner of my block. This should cause an emotional response anywhere… and it does for me. But we’ve somehow normalized this! Here the investigators’ yellow tape attracts kids who, just thanks to the spectacle and the crowds that come from all around to see the corpse, get to play in the street even if it’s just for a little while. However long it takes to carry away that next-to-last body, however long it takes for the grim reaper to show up again working in the next neighborhood over.</p>
<p>The children play and among them – in a carnival of rushing around, cameras, notepads, and crime – journalism harvests its colorful scenes; coffin vendors  run behind the family members of the victim to get in that day’s sale. Or those suicidal people who tempt fate running their mouth. Who talk. In Honduras talking at all is always too much.</p>
<p>Those are the stories drawn in this graphic novel. Stories about us Hondurans who have learned to live with the corpses: journalists, transit workers, tattoo artists, vendors, drug dealers, kidnappers, musicians, children… not about the inhabitants of the underworld. They are stories about the people who dared to tell me about their lives. The people who have adapted and spend their days in this country.</p>
<p>Let me explain to you better, with comic strips from street level, how to survive where one has to make a habit of silence  or become an attraction between yellow tape.</p>

Mi nombre es German Andino. Soy un artista/periodista hondureño. Permíteme contarte de qué se trata este proyecto...







Las estadísticas, con todo el peso de su imprecisión, hasta el 2014, decían que Honduras era el país más violento del mundo y los medios lo han repetido hasta el punto en el que nuestros 103 homicidios por cada 100,000 habitantes son un dato ambiguo e inútil. Diez, quince, diecinueve homicidios al día, ya dan igual. Se ha repetido tanto que se anula su impacto.El país se ha convertido en un espacio muestral frío, una tierra estéril que exporta poco más que bananos. Que se ofrece al lucimiento de los reporteros que lo pasean rápido y con cuidado. ""Honduras es el infierno, ¡vean!""...Este cómic pretende lo contrario: Llevarte de la mano por las calles temidas de Honduras y darte unas palmaditas en la espalda mientras los latidos de tu corazón se tranquilizan y te permiten ver a la gente que no es noticia,  los que seguimos vivos; como el periodista de nota roja del primer capítulo, o el vendedor de cocaína -que quiere ser como Daddy Yankee- de uno posterior. No hay estadística que cuente los charcos de sangre que uno pisa ni las ráfagas de AK-47 que, desde lejos, atragantan cenas o cantan canciones de cuna. Como tampoco puede pesarse la cocaína que, regada por el suelo, marca la ruta del narcotráfico que sube a Norteamérica. La vida diaria no entra en ningún titular ni la capta el reportero de guerra más avezado del mundo en un paseo de dos semanas.A veces -demasiadas a mis 30 años-, veo algún muerto en la esquina de mi casa. En cualquier parte esto sería un golpe emocional... Y me incluyo: ¡Cuánto hemos normalizado esto! Aquí, son las cintas amarillas de la fiscalía las que atraen a los niños que, sólo gracias al espectáculo y las multitudes que se juntan para ver el cadáver, pueden jugar en la calle aunque sea solo por un momento, lo que se tarda en levantar al penúltimo muerto, lo que se tarda en volver a encontrarse a la parca trabajando en otro barrio.Juegan los niños y entre ellos -como en un gran carnaval de saltos, prisas, cámaras, libretas y crímenes- cosecha el periodismo escenas llenas de color; vendedores de ataúdes que corren detrás de los familiares de las víctimas para lograr la venta del día. O suicidas que juegan a irse de la lengua. Que hablan. En Honduras, hablar es siempre demasiado.Esas son las historias que se dibujan en esta novela gráfica. Las de los hondureños que  hemos aprendido a convivir con los cadáveres: periodistas, transportistas, tatuadores, comerciantes, dealers, secuestradores, músicos, niñas... No las de los habitantes del averno; las de los que se atrevieron a contarme un poco de su vida. Los que se adaptaron y pasan sus días en este país. Déjenme explicarles mejor, con viñetas y a pie de calle, cómo se sobrevive en el lugar donde hay que desarrollar el hábito de ponerse la mordaza o servir de parque de atracciones entre cintas amarillas.                                                                         ***Aquí van las primeras páginas(posiblemente no en su versión final) de la novela...Puedes hojearla en Issuu: Descarga directa, PDF versión en español(¡compartí!):

El proyecto ""Honduras: El hábito de la mordaza"" empezó en el formato de la crónica periodística. Texto puro y duro en un blog y en dos o tres revistas. 


El siguiente paso fue ilustrar buena parte del trabajo de reporteo que hice intermitentemente durante un par de años en las ciudades más peligrosas de Honduras. Después, dibujar. Y dibujar más. Sin parar. 

Así, estas investigaciones se convirtieron en una novela gráfica en proceso. Ahora, el siguiente paso es: editarlo, completarlo y que se lea. Lo colgaremos en Internet para que todo el que quiera y nos apoye pueda tener este material de primera linea de combate. ¡Directo a tu ordenador! Sin intermediarios.

Aquí tienes un pequeño regalo por haber llegado hasta aquí:

</div></div>","Thanks for taking some time to view our Indiegogo project! We are a writing team seeking funding for two comic books, The Ascendant and Horsemen. Both books are currently in production and will be debuted at the New York Comicon (NYCC). Below is a brief description of both comics and some artwork. For a more comprehensive look at how much it costs to put out a comic book (significantly more than we are asking for here), please see our post on the subject in the updates tab above.
Important note: All rewards will be paid even if we don't reach our goal!   
The Ascendant:
The Ascendant is about Cail, an escaped Duke of Hell, who has entered our world and is righting some of his wrongs by sending other escaped demons back to the Pit. His first challenge comes in the form of a nasty villain named Halstein, the Earl of the Bleak Isles. Check out their first battle below:



Cail is joined in his quest by another escapee, Faustus. Faustus provides Cail with help in the form of arcane knowledge. He's a surly, but well intentioned fellow.  You can also see Cail's meeting with Faustus below:

 
 
Horsemen:
There is a game of chess being played for dominion over the multiverse. On the side of freedom are the Horsemen, an elite fighting force of intergalactic guardians. Their nemesis, Fate and Destiny, look to extinguish all freewill and remake everything in their colorless image. They have battled for the souls of sentient beings across space and time longer than recorded history. Fate and Destiny have multitudes of plans, each more devious than the next, but they are all connected to their ultimate scheme - complete domination of all existence!Led by their senior Horseman War and narrated by his protégé Destruction, the limited series is a adventure that will take its heroes on quests to strange alien worlds or anywhere a battle must be fought. The first issue opens with the fall of the godlike Horseman Thanatos and the emergence of his replacement Gemna, a man born of one of our earthly tragedies. Check out some images:

Formed by a bunch of old college buddies who were tired of living in creative obscurity, our goal is to tell original stories, regardless of genre. All of us have to work full-time jobs to pay off loans and rent, but we’re doing this because it’s our passion. We love comics. We all love writing and drawing our own comics and want to get our stuff out there to be read by fans and professionals alike. We’ve already been hard at work making our dream a reality, creating a line of books, now we just need the funds to get our books in the hands and on the computer screens of everyone out there.

<p> </p></div>","Who are we? Old College Comics is an independent comic publisher staffed by creators who are, above all else, fans of the medium. Formed by a bunch of old college buddies who were tired of living in creative obscurity, our goal is to tell original stories, regardless of genre. All of us have to work full-time jobs to pay off loans and rent, but we’re doing this because it’s our passion. We love comics. We all love writing and drawing our own comics and want to get our stuff out there to be read by fans and professionals alike. We’ve already been hard at work making our dream a reality, creating a line of books, now we just need the funds to get our books in the hands and on the computer screens of everyone out there. If you’d like to help us, we’d greatly appreciate it. What have we got lined up? We’ve got two books in the works. The cornerstone of Old College Comics is our anthology book, The Freshmen Fifteen--a collection of comics that shows what our 24 writers and artists can do. The anthology will be:

15 black & white comics with a full-color cover
110 pages of story
2 or 10-page comics in anti-boredom, easily-digestible, length 
all printed in a standard comic size format (6.625x10.25)
available in print and online as a digital download
Along with that, we’ve got the first issue of our 22-page superhero comic, Afterman, written by Joe Bryant and Mike Pallotta, and beautifully drawn and watercolored by Jeff Chang.At this point, Afterman and all 15 comics in the anthology have been completely scripted out, edited, and are in the process of being drawn by our artists. On top of that we’ve been building a site to showcase all of the talent and projects involved at OldCollegeComics.com.What are the comics about?In the anthology, we’ve got:

Ragnar: the adventure of a loin-clothed Viking prince on the run from his countrymen. He has been running for two days without stopping. It’s his birthday.
Idiot Dad: a slice of life comic about the stupidity of one young father.
Alex Elwood: a trip into another world with a guy and the monstrous giant he befriends. Is it real life? Is it just fantasy? It’s only 10 pages, so it won’t take too long to find out. 
The House on the Forest’s Edge: a horror story about a home for orphans who have to fight for survival whenever a new kid comes to stay. 
Lonely: the memoirs of a delusional and delightful little girl who wants to move to Hollywood, but doesn’t realize she already lives there. 
Bad Pun Comics: a Sunday-strip style collection of awful, awful puns. 
You’re STUCK Here: the minglings of a group of friends who attend a community college and can’t seem to ever graduate or date anyone outside of their own circle.
Dummies: the story of a family of unwitting robots caught in the middle of a futuristic war game between two soldiers.
Child Gone Wild: a comedic-thriller following two detectives tracking down a demon fetus who teleports from womb to womb, destroying relationships with each jump. 
Population 1: a sci-fi comic about a man confined from society in a home filled wall-to-wall with moving screens that show everything from the news to his inner-most thoughts.
No Way Out: the tale of a man whose number of suicide attempts are only outnumbered by the number of ways he’s imagined his own death, each of which have failed miserably.
Katzenkotze: baroque, vaudevillian, and soul-encompassing, this two-part creation will leave you as wide-eyed and captivated as the owner of a vomiting cat, scrambling to clear shoes, clothes and blankets out of the way before certain destructive explosion damns it all.

Old Time Manatee Comics: the sometimes-educational-depending-on-how-little-you-know-about-manatees adventures of a manatee, Morris T. Manatee, and all the bullshit a manatee gets up to. Manatee.
Junklords: the story of two junkyard workers who come across something that’s not quite man, not quite machine.
And finally, we’ve got Rocket Arms: the tale of a man who finds a genie’s lamp on the beach. What does he wish for? Only the title can tell (in a very self-explanatory way)!

Outside of the anthology, we've got our superhero comic. The first issue of Afterman which follows Greg Martelli as he moves from Chicago to Long Beach looking to start fresh in the city of his favorite hero, Afterman. Things go from bad motel to worse when Greg’s caught in the middle of a battle between his idol and a handful of dangerous villains throwing exploding pom-poms, blasting streams of fire, sweating acid onto innocent people, and generally destroying everything in sight. Can Greg survive? Will Afterman save the day? Did I just say “sweating acid”? At least one of the answers is yes!When are we looking to publish? The week of Halloween, just in time for Long Beach Comic Con, November 3rd-4th! The artists are currently sketching out their pages and we’re moving along nicely. With your support we’ll be able to have a small press booth at the Con, and enough copies of our books to sell, along with any promotional material, so that we can properly get our work in the hands of comic readers. How do we plan to use your money?Any money donated to our cause will go directly into covering costs for: 

publishing both of our books, both in print and online
 shipping books and incentives
building and keeping up our website: OldCollegeComics.com 
the Long Beach Comic Con booth
promotional material for LBCC (a banner, business cards, two posters, and prints)
the incentives for all you wonderful people supporting us here (t-shirts, promo cards, prints, character sketches, etc.).

What if we exceed our goal? Any excess funds received will go directly to our next line of books, and securing booths at any future comic conventions.What if we don’t raise the funds?We’ll try not to cry and tweet about it. For updates, comments or questions:

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name's Evin and for about the past 2 years I've been self-publishing the all-ages fantasy comic Knifestone over at <a href=""http://knifestone.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://knifestone.net</a>, the third chapter of which is wrapping up, and it's time I put out a for-reals book. I've been doing some hand-stapled, photocopied editions of the first chapters as I go, but it's time for something better.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I've weighed my options decided to go with the comics-centric digital printing service Ka-Blam (<a href=""http://ka-blam.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://ka-blam.com</a>). I'm only looking to do about 100 copies of the ~176 page book which will cover me for the few conventions I attend, sending out to publishers, selling on the website, stocking at the bookstore I work at and the few comic stores in town, and then some. Of course, if I manage to exceed my goals the first priority is to bump up the number I can print.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Helping me fund this print run will not only help me monetarily but, almost more importantly, will be a pretty big boost emotionally. I've got a nice little readership (about 100 or so weekly) which is awesome and I appreciate it, but I don't get a ton of feedback and I'm pretty quick to get down on myself and feel like I'm doing this for nothing. I'm super happy pushing through those feelings (I've only missed half a week in the past two years and that was 'cuz I was really sick) regardless because I care enough about the story to tell it and comics and storytelling in general are what I want to do with my life, but it'd be really, really nice to just feel that I'm making enough of an impact that a few kind people would be willing to throw some dollars my way to make it happen.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The costs for my run are pretty meager - just shy of $500 or so. I've also got some travel costs and stuff for the convention in May I'm attending and want the book printed in time for (<a href=""http://www.vancaf.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.vancaf.com/</a>), but that's about it. <br/></p>
<p>If I don't hit the final total then I'm still going to print the book, but only about 50 copies or so which I can probably swing on my own (just under $300 or so). So because I'll be printing regardless of how much I make, everyone will get their premiums no matter what.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>The best way you can help, honestly, is to read my comic and tell your friends if you like it. Tweet it out, join the Facebook fan page, throw things (responsibly and with attribution, plz&amp;thx) on Tumblr, leave some comments on my website, whatever. My whole goal in printing books and getting out there and doing shows is just to get people to read my stuff. If all you can do is talk about me, that's really all I ask, and I'm eternally grateful.<br/></p>

<p>The story picks up on the night of a reunion between the six friends who grew up together at Saint Christopher’s Orphanage in Long Island, New York.  They are reminded of a story from their childhood involving a hidden land inside the Himalayas where the Holy Grail was kept in secret, guarded by an ancient race called the Peregrinus.  Upon hearing that name, memories are triggered among the group involving incredible things they could do as children while at the orphanage. </p>
<p>As the group tries to make sense of these new memories, they are joined by their old priest who implores them to go on a quest with him to the Himalayas, where they must become the frightening power of good to protect the Grail from an ancient evil that seeks to possess it.</p>

<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Late last year we completed a successful campaign for the Dominus.  Earlier this year we filled all of our orders and in the time between have completely sold out of our first print run.  This campaign is for funding our second print run, which will sport an all new cover. We are hoping to raise $2,600.  Once the printing is covered we will send all the files to the printer.  We are hoping to ship the book to all the backers in February of 2020.  If we can make that happen sooner, we will. </p>
<p>We have 3 perk levels that will give the backers some really cool swag.</p>
<p>Anything we raise over the goal will be used for additional perks and for starting on another exciting project I am currently writing.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Bringing these characters to life is a dream come true for me.  All the positive feedback I have received on this book has touched my heart and I am so very thankful and humble.  I created these characters years ago as a way to entertain my younger sister and brother.  Now to see them in the pages of their comic book AND that people love this story- words can't express how awesome this feels!</p>
<p>This project is dedicated to Fred Browne and Drew Wessel.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>This is my second Indiegogo project and I am super stoked about it!   I have years of experience in big and small business. I have launched markets for major companies and in 2007 I purchased a failing comic book store and turned it around into a viable business.  I know how to lead people and manage results.  Most of all I know the most important element of any business or project is its customers!</p>

<p><span>I'm Piti Yindee from Thailand and I'm the creator of the webcomic, <a href=""http://www.wufflecomics.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Wuffle</strong></a>. <span>'Wuffle' is a free webcomic about everyday life of Wuffle, the big nice wolf and his friends in the Gingerbread Village. The comic has its own proper website that updates every Wednesday, as well as other social network outlets such as <span><a href=""http://wufflecomic.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Tumblr</strong></a> or <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/wufflecomic"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Facebook</strong></a><span>.

<div>When I said Wuffle is a free webcomic, I meant Free-As-In-Freedom. The webcomic uses CC0 1.0 or “<strong>NO COPYRIGHT</strong>”. That simply means 'Wuffle' comic is free for everyone. You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, anyway you want.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>For more information of what you can do with Wuffle, see <a href=""http://www.wufflecomics.com/free-license/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Wuffle free license</strong></a>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I want Wuffle to be a comic for everyone. I want to bring back the old charms of the good’ old classic cartoon that we saw when we were young. And I hope you enjoy the comic, and will come to love Wuffle the same way that I have. ^^</div>

<div>This campaign is made for you to help me make ""Wuffle"" into a real, color printed book! The book will include:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>All of the comics from its first year (14th Febuary 2012 - 13th February 2013)</li>
<li>All comics will be proofread by a professional proofreader as well as fixing any errors from the webcomic version</li>
<li>Special illustrations made for the book by me and several guest artists</li>
<li>Behind-the-scene sketches</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>All of these will be printed in a hard-cover A5-size full color 100-page book. Limited for this campaign only.<br/><br/><img alt=""Inside the book"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1062793/WuffleComics/Campaign/Picture1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1062793/WuffleComics/Campaign/Line.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><h3><img alt=""Making The Book"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1062793/WuffleComics/Campaign/Header3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<div>
<div>Since I'm self publishing the book, I'll need your help to make this book come true. The money will be spent on the publishing process as well as hiring a professional English proofreader to help editing the comic.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm thinking of printing around 500 copies, but this could change depending on how well the campaign go! You can help me by choosing the perks you like on the right side.<br/><br/>All of the perks with physical rewards already include worldwide shipping cost, so you don't need to add anymore money for shipping. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Also, this is a <strong>Fixed Funding</strong>. This means the book will be printed only when I reach the goal before the deadline. If this campaign doesn't reach the goal, you will get a refund, and the book won't be printed.

I'm Piti Yindee from Thailand and I'm the creator of the webcomic, Wuffle. 'Wuffle' is a free webcomic about everyday life of Wuffle, the big nice wolf and his friends in the Gingerbread Village. The comic has its own proper website that updates every Wednesday, as well as other social network outlets such as Tumblr or Facebook. There is also a Japanese version on Pixiv.
When I said Wuffle is a free webcomic, I meant Free-As-In-Freedom. The webcomic uses CC0 1.0 or “NO COPYRIGHT”. That simply means 'Wuffle' comic is free for everyone. You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, anyway you want.
 
For more information of what you can do with Wuffle, see Wuffle free license

 
I want Wuffle to be a comic for everyone. I want to bring back the old charms of the good’ old classic cartoon that we saw when we were young. And I hope you enjoy the comic, and will come to love Wuffle the same way that I have. ^^

This campaign is made for you to help me make ""Wuffle"" into a real, color printed book! The book will include:


All of the comics from its first year (14th Febuary 2012 - 13th February 2013)
All comics will be proofread by a professional proofreader as well as fixing any errors from the webcomic version
Special illustrations made for the book by me and several guest artists
Behind-the-scene sketches


All of these will be printed in a hard-cover A5-size full color 100-page book. Limited for this campaign only.

Since I'm self publishing the book, I'll need your help to make this book come true. The money will be spent on the publishing process as well as hiring a professional English proofreader to help editing the comic.
 
I'm thinking of printing around 500 copies, but this could change depending on how well the campaign go! You can help me by choosing the perks you like on the right side.All of the perks with physical rewards already include worldwide shipping cost, so you don't need to add anymore money for shipping. 
 
Also, this is a Fixed Funding. This means the book will be printed only when I reach the goal before the deadline. If this campaign doesn't reach the goal, you will get a refund, and the book won't be printed. Even if the campaign fail, I will still continue drawing Wuffle for you, and hopefully I can try again in the future ^^

<p><strong>Chris Hepler: Writer</strong></p>
<p>It is not certain that Chris Hepler had parents — according to the sacred texts of the 1970s, he was given life when Gary Gygax made a papier-mache golem out of discarded pages intended for a roleplaying game. After a short stint at the Johns Hopkins University where Chris was painted to resemble a human, he began working for such titles as <i>Shadowrun</i>, <i>Earthdawn</i>, and <i>Legend of the Five Rings</i> before pursuing screenwriting. In Los Angeles, he worked on a CBS Television drama <i>The Agency</i> and a Top Cow comic called <i>M.I.T.H.</i>, but left for Canada, where the developer Bioware soon had him writing for such video games as <i>Star Wars: The Old Republic </i>and the <i>Mass Effect</i> trilogy.</p>
<p>There, he cemented his position as “that writer who actually cares about the science,” creating much of Mass Effect’s Codex, Galaxy Map, and Daily News. His launch-day Twitter event for <i>Mass Effect 3</i>, “Emily Wong Reports Live from UCLA,” made #solcomms the top-trending worldwide hashtag of the day, and yes, that means you can blame him for killing off several beloved characters.</p>
<p>Today, Chris is working for Seasun Games on a <i>Pirates of the Caribbean </i>video game as well as its comics arm. He enjoys dragon boating, herpetology, and as many martial arts as he can get his hands on. He lives in California with his wife, Jennifer Brandes Hepler, and their two loud children. </p>

<p><strong>Philip Daay: Managing Editor</strong></p>
<p>Phil Daay serves as Lead Writer and Managing Editor for international game company Seasun, Inc.  He oversees his company’s narrative efforts to produce their online mobile game Pirates of the Caribbean: Sea of Glory in partnership with Disney.  He also supervises all aspects of production at his employer’s latest comic book publishing venture, called Seasun Comics.</p>
<p>In the film industry, Phil wrote the feature and short film adaptations of the critically-acclaimed comic series <i>Black Salt</i>.  The <i>Black Salt </i>short film recently won 1st Place in the Urban Action Showcase.  HBO/Cinemax agreed to broadcast the film and it thereafter gained over 3.3 million viewers on their platform.  His upcoming Sci-Fi/Thriller movie <i>Abduct </i>won distribution at the AFM.  His Psychological/Thriller <i>Alone </i>has recently completed post-production.  He also wrote the Horror movie <i>Left in Darkness</i> for legendary producer Stephen J. Cannell.</p>
<p>Phil strives to include three crucial elements in every story.  Stories should escalate into an emotional catharsis in the end. They should contain loads of suspense and keep audiences guessing.  Most importantly, stories should explore some aspect of what it means to be human, layered deeply into the Hero's tale. He applies this discipline and passion to every story and in every genre.</p>
<p>Phil currently lives in California with his wife and a toddler who loves to wander off and explore the wide open world.</p>

<h3><strong>And the last word...</strong></h3>
<p>We hope that this page answers all your Mythkillers questions, but just in case it doesn't, you can leave comments on the Indiegogo page or send an email to <strong>philip@seasungames.com</strong>. </p>
<p>We've warned Phil that he might get a mountain of e-mails as soon as the Indiegogo goes live, so he's prepared. Or at least, we <i>thought</i> we warned him. Good luck, Phil!</p>
<p>In all seriousness...</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The Mythkillers series is currently in production. Publishing or manufacturing delays on the book or merchandise could arise due to unforeseen circumstances. Seasun Comics shall keep all Indiegogo donors informed about the publication of Mythkillers and the manufacturing/shipping status of all items. <br/><br/>Donor packages that involve the review of scripts and story content (i.e. screenplay review) will require up to six months to fulfill, and are subject to the availability of Seasun Comics key employees giving direct feedback.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you want to help out but have more time than funds, no worries. Spreading the word about our comic and our company is a great way to help out.</p>

<p>Our website <a href=""http://www.seasuncomics.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.seasuncomics.com</a> often posts updates. Be sure to sign up for the newsletter.</p>

<p>And Indiegogo has its own share tools!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why Indiegogo?</h3>
<p>Let's address the elephant in the room. If we're a big gaming company, why are we crowdfunding an indie urban fantasy comic? To be clear, Seasun Comics doesn't need donations. The production artwork for the entire series is already 95% complete.</p>
<p>But crowdfunding is about more than just money.</p>
<p>We need Indiegogo because we're a small team without a distribution network. We're competing against 80+ years of legacy by the established publishers. We can't easily get Mythkillers into your local comics store. With Indiegogo, we can send the comics directly to you.</p>
<p>Also, we can't buy the most crucial thing for any new comics: fans. Crowdfunding gives us an amazing opportunity to invite fans to go on this journey with us.</p>
<p>Comics creators can only build fan communities up out of blood, sweat, and convention appearances until they have followers, mailing lists and Facebook groups. </p>
<p>Lastly, Seasun is measuring the success of its new comic projects to see which of them seems viable enough to turn into a video game or movie. By supporting Mythkillers, you’re helping its chances of becoming something you can play or watch.  </p>
<p>Seasun Comics is our way to honor the tradition of our founders by bridging the gap between East and West.  </p>

Her journey to discover the culprit will take her through the Egyptian underworld, into the North Sea, and to the Grand Shrine of Japan, all to answer a single question… who would dare disrupt death itself? 
 

What We Need & What You Get!
Mythkillers was successfully funded via Kickstarter this summer, but we're turning to Indiegogo to continue offering our backer rewards while we set up a more permanent online store. From the $1 pledge for a single digital comic issue, all the way up to jewelry swag and embossed hardcover collectors' editions, our variety of rewards offers a wide palette for different budgets and levels of commitment.
Please Note:
*  All displays of rewards are mock-ups, and may not reflect the visual appearance of the final products. As more artwork gets completed, we'll be able to post samples to this page.
*  International supporters should consider digital reward packages (The Broke Classics Student, the Symposium, or The Heavenly Wisdom Special) because they have no additional shipping charges or shipping time.
 
Add-ons
We're happy to announce that backers can now pick and choose the rewards they wish to receive.  Just use the Indiegogo perk system to customize your reward package.  PLEASE NOTE: Pledges with only digital rewards don't have the option to buy add-ons in order to keep international shipping charges consistent across all reward packages. Those who wish to purchase a mix of physical and digital rewards should start with one of the other packages.

The Creative Team

Vicente Cifuentes: Illustrator & Inker
Born in the small, beautiful Spanish city of Albacete, Vicente Cifuentes works as a gifted 20-year veteran of the comics industry. He has devoted his considerable penciling and inking skills to some of the largest publishers around the world, including Marvel, DC Comics, Dynamite Entertainment, Glénat, and Soleil, among many, many others. Some of the most notable titles under his belt include Aquaman, Batgirl, Xena: Warrior Princess, and a comic book adaptation of The War of the Worlds by H. G. Wells. 
 

Mateo Guerrero Cruz: Illustrator
Born in Cadiz, Spain in 1976, Mateo Guerrero boasts an illustrious career among some of the most prominent publications in Europe. His first published work was Crónicas de Mesene in 1998. Then, he created Cazadores en la Red, a comic strip published by Idibus, a supplement for the newspaper El País, the most widely read online newspaper in Spain. In 2001, Mateo broke through into the English language market, drawing Warlands: Age of Ice, for the studio DreamWave. Then, Guerrero conquered the Franco-Belgian market, producing DragonSeed in 2006 for the publisher Humanoïdes Associés. He enjoys a long-running collaboration with publisher Le Lombard that began in 2008 that saw the release of the post-apocalyptic adventure story Beast, the fantasy series Turo in 2011, the grand Roman Empire epic Gloria Victis, and the recent dark historical thriller Jakob Kayne.
 

Juancho Vélez: Colorist
Juancho is a passionate, ambitious comic book colorist and illustrator who graduated from the Kubert School of Cartoon and Graphic Art located in Dover, New Jersey. Ever since 2012, Juancho has studied color and its nuances as a means to enhance storytelling. He has dedicated his vivid hues to prominent publishers, such as IDW, Aspen Comics, Madefire, Chapter House, Darby Pop, Devil’s Due, Markosia, Zenescope, and even one small gig for DC Comics (which he hopes will blossom into something much bigger in the future!). Born and raised in Bogota, Colombia, he has ventured across the globe in pursuit of his dreams. He’s lived on and explored both the east and west coasts of the USA. Then, after learning his craft, Juancho forged new friendships and professional contacts in the comic book industry. They enabled him to relocate to Barcelona, Spain where he has plied his artistic craft ever since. As a heavyweight in the world of American and European comics, Spain provided a wonderful creative environment that encouraged Juancho to grow immensely as an artist. Finally, we almost forgot to mention that Juancho is currently on a worldwide search for the best cheeseburger in existence. Got any leads? 
 

Bill Tortolini: Letterer
Born and raised in the shadow of Boston, Bill Tortolini graduated from Salem State University. He has held the position of creative director for over two decades. In addition to working on large brands and advertisements for Fortune 500 companies, Bill also became deeply involved in the comics industry starting in 1996. Over the course of his vibrant career, he has lettered comics for some of the most prominent publishers in the world, including Marvel, Dynamite Entertainment, Random House, Disney, and Image Comics, among many others. Notable works include Marvel’s Anita Blake comics, the various adaptations of Robert Jordan’s bestselling Wheel of Time series, Stephen King’s The Talisman, Jim Butcher’s The Dresden Files, and George R. R. Martin’s The Hedge Knight and The Mystery Knight. Bill is an avid Boston sports fan, skier, golfer, and pop-culture aficionado. He lives in Billerica, Massachusetts, with his lovely wife, Kristen, their three children Abigail, Katherine, and Cameron, and his sometimes-loyal dog, Oliver. 
 

Chris Hepler: Writer
It is not certain that Chris Hepler had parents — according to the sacred texts of the 1970s, he was given life when Gary Gygax made a papier-mache golem out of discarded pages intended for a roleplaying game. After a short stint at the Johns Hopkins University where Chris was painted to resemble a human, he began working for such titles as Shadowrun, Earthdawn, and Legend of the Five Rings before pursuing screenwriting. In Los Angeles, he worked on a CBS Television drama The Agency and a Top Cow comic called M.I.T.H., but left for Canada, where the developer Bioware soon had him writing for such video games as Star Wars: The Old Republic and the Mass Effect trilogy.
There, he cemented his position as “that writer who actually cares about the science,” creating much of Mass Effect’s Codex, Galaxy Map, and Daily News. His launch-day Twitter event for Mass Effect 3, “Emily Wong Reports Live from UCLA,” made #solcomms the top-trending worldwide hashtag of the day, and yes, that means you can blame him for killing off several beloved characters.
Today, Chris is working for Seasun Games on a Pirates of the Caribbean video game as well as its comics arm. He enjoys dragon boating, herpetology, and as many martial arts as he can get his hands on. He lives in California with his wife, Jennifer Brandes Hepler, and their two loud children. 
 

Ed Benes: Cover Artist
Perhaps best known for his work on Birds of Prey, Justice League of America, and Batgirl for DC Comics, Ed Benes is one of the industry’s hottest talents! Following the successful launch of the first issue of his first creator-owned title Nina and Ariel, Ed is now hard at work on Issue 2, while also training the next generation of comic book artists at the Ed Benes Studio. 
 

Rafater (a.k.a. Rafael Teruel): Cover Artist
Rafater (whose superhero secret identity is Rafael Teruel) is a Spanish illustrator and masterclass artist. He studied Fine Arts in Barcelona and began his professional career 10 years ago when he discovered the power of digital art. He mainly works as an illustrator and has designed characters for several large companies and game projects, including Warhammer, Warhammer 40K, Legend of the Cryptids, Dragoborne, Infinity the game, and HEX TCG among many others.
He published several art books with Norma Editorial (Nightmare: Dark Gods), Design Studio Press (The Line Art Challenge), and Ediciones Babylon (EROS: The Sexiest Art of Rafater). He’s also the co-founder of the Creatuanary Challenge along with Dibujante Nocturno and Joshua Cairós. Together, they successfully executed their first crowdfunding campaign for the first Creatuanary published art book. Rafater is incredibly active on social media, especially on Instagram, where he has garnered almost 170,000 fans over two years. 
Currently, Rafater teaches part-time at Escola Joso and the Universitat la Salle while also aiding the development of some pretty fresh and amazing art projects that are under NDA (so he can’t talk about them! Don’t ask!)
 

Ediano Silva: Cover Artist
Ediano hit the ground running with his professional debut on the incredibly successful relaunch of Grimm Fairy Tales for Zenescope (v2 issues 1-3) and hasn’t let up since! Following his stint on GFT, Ediano illustrated the entire Pathfinder: Runescars series for Dynamite Entertainment, and then moved on to the comic book adaptation of the popular Microsoft video game Killer Instinct, while also adding nearly 20 cover illustrations whenever he had a free moment …and this was all completed in just his first year in the industry! Ediano is a workhorse with a finely detailed style, and the future is bright! Ediano just completed work on Vampirella / Dejah Thoris, and is just starting in on his new project (as yet unannounced).  
 

Rich Young: Art Director
Rich began his professional career in the U.S. comics industry over 20 years ago at Dark Horse Comics, and most recently finished a 9-year run as Director of Business Development for Dynamite Entertainment. His broad background spans editorial, licensing, marketing, and business development. Some of the graphic novels and art books Rich has edited or project managed include: Brandon Sanderson’s White Sand, Jim Butcher’s Dresden Files, Joe Abercrombie’s The First Law, Robert Jordan’s Wheel of Time, Charlaine Harris’ Grave Sight, Patricia Briggs’ Mercy Thompson, Paizo’s Pathfinder, Paramount’s The Warriors, Grumpy Cat, The Art of Atari, Undisputed Street Fighter: A 30th Anniversary Retrospective, and The Art of Tekken: A Complete Visual History.
A longtime resident of the beautiful Pacific Northwest, Rich lives, works and plays in Portland, Oregon. Rich is also the drummer in the local 5-man band Dear Drummer. The soul/funk/rock group regularly gig around town and have plans to go back into the studio to record their third album later this year.
 

Philip Daay: Managing Editor
Phil Daay serves as Lead Writer and Managing Editor for international game company Seasun, Inc.  He oversees his company’s narrative efforts to produce their online mobile game Pirates of the Caribbean: Sea of Glory in partnership with Disney.  He also supervises all aspects of production at his employer’s latest comic book publishing venture, called Seasun Comics.
In the film industry, Phil wrote the feature and short film adaptations of the critically-acclaimed comic series Black Salt.  The Black Salt short film recently won 1st Place in the Urban Action Showcase.  HBO/Cinemax agreed to broadcast the film and it thereafter gained over 3.3 million viewers on their platform.  His upcoming Sci-Fi/Thriller movie Abduct won distribution at the AFM.  His Psychological/Thriller Alone has recently completed post-production.  He also wrote the Horror movie Left in Darkness for legendary producer Stephen J. Cannell.
Phil strives to include three crucial elements in every story.  Stories should escalate into an emotional catharsis in the end. They should contain loads of suspense and keep audiences guessing.  Most importantly, stories should explore some aspect of what it means to be human, layered deeply into the Hero's tale. He applies this discipline and passion to every story and in every genre.
Phil currently lives in California with his wife and a toddler who loves to wander off and explore the wide open world.
 
And the last word...
We hope that this page answers all your Mythkillers questions, but just in case it doesn't, you can leave comments on the Indiegogo page or send an email to philip@seasungames.com. 
We've warned Phil that he might get a mountain of e-mails as soon as the Indiegogo goes live, so he's prepared. Or at least, we thought we warned him. Good luck, Phil!
In all seriousness...
 
Risks & Challenges
The Mythkillers series is currently in production. Publishing or manufacturing delays on the book or merchandise could arise due to unforeseen circumstances. Seasun Comics shall keep all Indiegogo donors informed about the publication of Mythkillers and the manufacturing/shipping status of all items. Donor packages that involve the review of scripts and story content (i.e. screenplay review) will require up to six months to fulfill, and are subject to the availability of Seasun Comics key employees giving direct feedback.


 
Other Ways You Can Help
If you want to help out but have more time than funds, no worries. Spreading the word about our comic and our company is a great way to help out.

Why Indiegogo?
Let's address the elephant in the room. If we're a big gaming company, why are we crowdfunding an indie urban fantasy comic? To be clear, Seasun Comics doesn't need donations. The production artwork for the entire series is already 95% complete.
But crowdfunding is about more than just money.
We need Indiegogo because we're a small team without a distribution network. We're competing against 80+ years of legacy by the established publishers. We can't easily get Mythkillers into your local comics store. With Indiegogo, we can send the comics directly to you.
Also, we can't buy the most crucial thing for any new comics: fans. Crowdfunding gives us an amazing opportunity to invite fans to go on this journey with us.
Comics creators can only build fan communities up out of blood, sweat, and convention appearances until they have followers, mailing lists and Facebook groups. 
Lastly, Seasun is measuring the success of its new comic projects to see which of them seems viable enough to turn into a video game or movie. By supporting Mythkillers, you’re helping its chances of becoming something you can play or watch.  
Seasun Comics is our way to honor the tradition of our founders by bridging the gap between East and West.",18.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><strong>My name is Stephanie and I have just finished my first graphic novel, ""Machination"". Here's a little more about the book:</strong></h2>
<p>In the year 6032, with the Earth abandoned long ago, the human population now resides on a Space Station surrounding the planet. This is the story of Nadily Tortalin, and is a tale for any person who has ever felt confused…</p>
<p>Nadily has been down on her luck, her entire life. She works in a humble office, traveling through time to solve murders of the past; helping to rewrite files that were deleted by some blundering fool years before.</p>
<p>A sudden and surprising event pulls her from her tedious lifestyle and into a world that she thought she had forgotten entirely. She finds herself falling down a path of mystery, murder and intrigue. Exploring further into this dark cavern of the unknown begins to put her own life in danger and she finds herself questioning her own existence; needing to know the truth about her past, present and future, but then discovering much more than she bargained for.</p>
<p>This multi-genre tale, asks the question, through love and dishonesty; who is deceiving the detective? We follow Nadily through her trials, from her tiresome routine into a world of dishonesty and action, will she be able to get over her own fears and to stop fighting the one thing she always craved: to be loved?</p>

<h2>About the project </h2>
<p><span>I have been working on this project for the last year and have finally completed it. The book is 153 pages long and is a SCI-FI/ Family drama, mixed with a little mystery. </span></p>
<p>I had the basic idea of the story about five years ago and have been developing it in my head ever since. It never really had an ending though, until I sat down and wrote out the 155 page long script. Then once I started drawing the characters, I felt a whole new excitement for the project, I could see them more clearly and felt that their story really needed to be told. </p>
<p>So I went about thumbing out all the pages, noting which was the best way to begin and continue the project, after all this was my first time making a graphic novel, as my background is in animation. As the days went on of getting up early, and working late into the night, I found out somehting odd- I was not getting annoyed with the project and I never once thought that I would give up. This is probably a true sign that I felt really passionate about ""Machination"".  It is my first graphic novel and won't be my last.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Why I need funding</h2>
<p><span>Apart from being that classic cliche of a poor artist, </span>I really want to get this project off of the shelf, and into your hands! I am passionate about what I have produced and feel that it is a really enjoyable read. </p>
<p>The book is available as a hard back or paper back, it's printed with full colour (on all pages), on luxurious matte paper.</p>

<h3>Feral: An Overview</h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>Feral is the insight of a few months in the life of Hayley Rosa, a girl who has nothing but a bitter will to fight. Upon drifting to a new city to scrape a living hustling with her fists, she is beaten for the first time by the highly skilled Dr Brandt, a loss that came with personal consequence. It was a new and humiliating experience for her, something that she couldn't shake off and leave alone.</em><br/><br/><em>Upon learning that Brandt is the top tier of a prestigious fighting circuit based in the city, she joins up to prove herself and take the doctor down by beating him at his own game. Between them stand a set of brutally proficient and sometimes sadistic fighters from all over the world who test Hayley to the very brink of her ability.</em><br/><br/><em>Among the battles however, she neglects the demons rising up inside her with every fight, chewing at her morals and sanity, fueled by a past she cannot let go...</em></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">This comic is a little something I've had in the pipeline for the longest time. It's been revised and thought out to completion, but if a metaphor is needed, it's like a fully re-fuelled and completely booked flight heading for Babylon. It's ready to fly, but is yet to take off due to there being an elephant on the runway or something. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Basically, I'm ready to move that elephant. All I need is funding and time. What I'm creating is almost a 'pilot', the first few chapters, introducing the main characters, a barrage of fisticuffs and ass kicking and generally making it an awesome intro to what I hope to be a complete series and the best first comic project I could hope to achieve.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">While I've extensively worked on commissions all this time, I've always had to push aside the project to work and feed myself. I want to go the next step and create something personal and awesome.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">What this means for you is you'll be treated to an orgasmic array of  Hayley dropping it hotter than Scott Adkins, as well as a funky fresh twist on your usual furry affair. Of course, contribution will not go unrewarded, as I have prepared a plethora of related goodies to say thankyou.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">I hope to get this project started and finished in time for some of the other Aussie comic-cons, so I can throw it out and spread the word. The more hype this gets, the better and more awesome the final, complete story will be (not to mention quicker too). My idea is to get funding and start it in the new year (2013), spend two months drawing it up and a few weeks touch up and printing. Your contributions will mean that you will make sure I have the needed tools and supplies, and that I work on the project (AND NOTHING ELSE) to complete the first few chapters.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Even if you're just spreading the word, you have my utmost grattitude. Thankyou all!</p>

I hope to get a stall there and hype the holy hell out of this comic, breathe fresh life into a comic genre that's over saturated with porn and/or fantasy. Once that's happened, Hayley's story can indeed continue and you'll get to see the awesome battles that she takes on.</p>

Once that's happened, Hayley's story can indeed continue and you'll get to see the awesome battles that she takes on.
Your contribution can be rewarded with:

downloadables and physical goodies
personal art related to the Feral universe
signed copies of the book
Cameo role in the comic in later installments (you get to fisticuff Hayley)



Just so you know, the comic is going forward regardless of the funding amount. It has already been started, but materials and equipment is still in demand for the pages I'm throwing out. Make it known if you are an overseas contributor so I can mail out any physical copies of the book etc etc.
Thank you all for your support!",0.0,0,"5 Campaigns

<p>DRAGOON KNIGHT ALDRAKE is an on going comic series in the style of an adult cartoon (South Park, Family Guy) with super hero action sequences. DRAGOON KNIGHT ALDRAKE: The Legendary Hero is the newest volume, a 140 page manga sized graphic novel by Matt Wenger.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>STORY</h2>
<p>It's been 75 years since Thomas Slugo sacrificed himself to stop an alien invasion that nearly destroyed his world. All over the planet Caliginus, Slugo is heralded as the greatest hero the world has ever known. As a selfish drunk redneck who grew up in a cave, Aldrake Razvalon isn't that guy. In a shocking revelation, Aldrake and sidekick Yoshi find Slugo has apparently returned to the side of the living. How and why? Worse they are in opposition to the great hero. Yoshi is an immortal sphinx who once fought alongside Slugo and knows first hand what Aldrake would be up against. Needless to say, it's a bad situation.<br/> </p>

At the time the ""Cyberpunk"" role-playing game (old school tabletop game. Remember... this is 25 or so years ago ;-) ) had just come out and I was really feeling the Cyberpunk/ Blade Runner vibe. But as with many stories, it ended up in my desk drawer only to be brought out now and again.</p><p>About a year or so ago, while going through the attic I stumbled upon a pile of sketches, notes, and rough layouts of the 25-year old, still unnamed  project . The characters, their backstory, the backstory of the city and world that this took place in, all still excited me. Even after all this time.</p><p>I'm not getting any younger and it won't happen on its own!  We've all heard or seen stories of elderly people who regret SO many things they didn't do in life.

Because of natural disasters and nuclear war, mankind lives in dome protected cities all across the globe.   They have colonized some of the planets and moons in the solar system, but colonist permission is granted to few and is sought after by many.  However, humanity has continued to evolve in their domed cities and thus the cyberpunk element of our story.In the future world of Cybernetic Punk, cybernetics have become as common as cosmetic surgery in our time. Everything from cybernetic limbs to chip implants that enhance vision or connect the user to the global network. Because of the rise in cybernetic associated crime a special task force, Cybersquad, was started.                                                           Cybernetic punk is a story I first wrote some 25 years ago. At the time the ""Cyberpunk"" role-playing game (old school tabletop game. Remember... this is 25 or so years ago ;-) ) had just come out and I was really feeling the Cyberpunk/ Blade Runner vibe. But as with many stories, it ended up in my desk drawer only to be brought out now and again.About a year or so ago, while going through the attic I stumbled upon a pile of sketches, notes, and rough layouts of the 25-year old, still unnamed  project . The characters, their backstory, the backstory of the city and world that this took place in, all still excited me. Even after all this time.I'm not getting any younger and it won't happen on its own!  We've all heard or seen stories of elderly people who regret SO many things they didn't do in life. So many dreams that they kept putting off until it was too late. The older we get the stronger those feelings become. Now, I don't consider 44 as being old. I'm not kicking the bucket quite yet, but I sure as heck don't want to be that bitter old man who didn't go after his dreams of making comics.  Over the years my skills as an artist and storyteller have improved and now I feel that I'm finally at a level where I can take on a project like this and do it justice.So...I'm going for it! It's go time!           The book will be:
21.59cm X 27.94cm (8.5in X 11in) The typical size of a European comic album.
Full-color covers
Over 60 pages of black & white Film Noir, cyberpunk goodness.

Godwell</strong> is the Bronx, New York born co-creator and artist of Nukleus first release <em><strong>'The Boy from Planet A'</strong></em> (2011). A veteran Graphic Designer and a lifelong comics collector, Corey along with childhood friend <strong>DaShen</strong> (Author of sci-fi novel <em><strong>The Rueful</strong></em>), decided to apply his illustrative talents into trying his hand at his own book. Some of the mainstream comics he grew up on were being contorted to suit Hollywood ambitions, much to his dislike. With just 8 pages completed (and liking what he saw) a computer accident wiped out the original 8 pages. Regathering and totally replacing the lost pages, he pushed forward and completed what became 'The Boy from Planet A', which told the story of a boy named Noah and his objective of retrieving a black box (of sorts) that contained the data of the previous earth that functions as present earths 'Heaven'. Instead of shopping the property (and with the assistance of friend and printer Dan Hort of Enterprise Press), he and DaShen decided to form indie label Nukleus Comics, work the shows (NYCC, NYCBMarketplace and Bronx Heroes Con) and slowly add more titles as demand and finances allowed.<br/><br/><img alt=""Dashen_solo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.broadwayltd.com/nukleus/campaign/DaShen.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin: 1px; float: right;"" title=""DaShen""/> Nukleus would focus on a diverse cast of characters that featured ""real everyday people"" (not just Super Models) who have found themselves thrust into epic situations. The titles under Nukleus are Sci-fi based and will focus on human, metaphysics and social issues such as social engineering, climate change, spiritual warfare, championing physical handicaps, the effects of social engineering and how the real world would react to humans endowed with cosmic powers and the potential to mass murder. Imagine a world faced with a human/spiritual/cosmic evolution, the likes of which they have never seen...with flawed humans who could wipe out a city block, should they choose the wrong path. A child or a loved one who is now deemed a threat? Infants that are human bombs should they become irate? Children and family hunted down, should it be decided that they are the 'wrong' race or religion while possessing such abilities. Real comics for real people in world turned upside down almost overnight.</p>

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">With three #1 titles being released at the New York Comic Con, Nukleus is making its official maiden voyage into the thriving and changing world of independent comic book publishing. With the creative obstacles in good hands, the second hurdle to cover is the financial backing, and that is where this campaign plays one of the more critical roles. This is the fuel that will help us set sail and push these creations and the Nukleus brand out to the public to compete with, not only the Big Two, but the hundreds of other properties being released on a weekly basis. We are confident in our product and with your assistance, we will show you why it is a worthy investment. Any amount is acceptable because any amount is appreciated. Every dollar is a step and brings us closer to fulfilling our end of this venture.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<em><strong>The Boy from Planet A</strong></em> - An oddly mature speaking teenage boy shows up in 1979 Bronx, New York to solicit the help of two local heroes to secure a 'black box' (of sorts) that he claims hold the data of his dying planet that he calls ""Old Earth"" and that it surrounds everything on this planet. He even claims it could be Heaven to our own earth. Children do lie.<br/><br/>This is the jump on point to the entire Nukleus universe. A must have.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<em><strong>NUKLEUS: 'Born Into This'</strong></em> - The follow up to 'The Boy from Planet A' and the repercussions that follow. A girl named Nikki has a secret. She decides to tell her best friend who can't hold water and has a penchant for trouble, but this is not a schoolyard secret. Its one that can unlock an interplanetary power source that takes the best or the worst in us and literally...well, check out the preview. (by Corey F Godwell)<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<em><strong>Cold Shoulder</strong></em> - After being crime-free for nearly three decades New York is thrust into mayhem after its protector mysteriously disappears. It’s been five years since Swift Justice, the city’s omnipresent hero vanished and NYPD is clueless how to handle the surge in crime. Amidst the virtual lawlessness, a physically challenged, psychotic, alcoholic with a third of his torso covered in an organic steel, Cold Shoulder, turns hired gun to turn chaos into cash. After deciding to take a job to find a boys missing mother as a favor to a friend, he soon learns easy money ain’t so easy. (by Da'Shen)<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<em><strong>Butterfly Sundae</strong></em> - Its 1981 America. Sklyab had fallen. Ronald Reagan is the President. Video hadn't yet killed radio. The nuclear threat still lingered. ""Adults cause way more s#!% than we kids do"". Meet Papillon, Butter, Chick P, Liz, Pristine, Oh!Donna and friends as they make their mark in the most decadent of times and thru the eyes, hearts and words of the boys who shaped their lives around winning the affections of these unique and mischievous girls.<br/><br/>""We can do what we want and just go to confession on Sunday""<br/>(by F.Corey)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<em><strong>Wunderkind</strong></em> - In a not so distant future NYC, a small band of children unknowingly discover a wormhole deep within a sealed off portion of the New York City subway system that leads to nexus of all things. They discover a world that thrives on the imagination and dreams of everyone in the universe. A universal data bank, of sorts...and its been taken under siege by the benefactor children of a long dead universe who survive on consuming hope and dreams. Naturally, they have got to be stopped, but there is a price that these kids are not ready to pay. (A/W: CFGodwell)</li>

<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Now, as you can see, we have set our goal at <strong>$5700</strong>. This is the nearly the bare minimum to fund decent sized small print runs of 200+ issues per book and that is 3 titles plus ashcans of to more titles. We also factored in the cost of a table at the <strong>New York Comic Con</strong>, posters, prints and to finance the sculpting of bust of one of the main characters (Nuklear Woman) that we will be accepting pre-orders for at the show. A nice portion of the pledge funds will go toward the sculptures artist fee. A third of it will go toward the production fees for the trade paperback/graphic novel of the collected 'Nukleus: Born Into This' that will be released Q1 of 2013.

Corey F. Godwell is the Bronx, New York born co-creator and artist of Nukleus first release 'The Boy from Planet A' (2011). A veteran Graphic Designer and a lifelong comics collector, Corey along with childhood friend DaShen (Author of sci-fi novel The Rueful), decided to apply his illustrative talents into trying his hand at his own book. Some of the mainstream comics he grew up on were being contorted to suit Hollywood ambitions, much to his dislike. With just 8 pages completed (and liking what he saw) a computer accident wiped out the original 8 pages. Regathering and totally replacing the lost pages, he pushed forward and completed what became 'The Boy from Planet A', which told the story of a boy named Noah and his objective of retrieving a black box (of sorts) that contained the data of the previous earth that functions as present earths 'Heaven'. Instead of shopping the property (and with the assistance of friend and printer Dan Hort of Enterprise Press), he and DaShen decided to form indie label Nukleus Comics, work the shows (NYCC, NYCBMarketplace and Bronx Heroes Con) and slowly add more titles as demand and finances allowed. Nukleus would focus on a diverse cast of characters that featured ""real everyday people"" (not just Super Models) who have found themselves thrust into epic situations. The titles under Nukleus are Sci-fi based and will focus on human, metaphysics and social issues such as social engineering, climate change, spiritual warfare, championing physical handicaps, the effects of social engineering and how the real world would react to humans endowed with cosmic powers and the potential to mass murder. Imagine a world faced with a human/spiritual/cosmic evolution, the likes of which they have never seen...with flawed humans who could wipe out a city block, should they choose the wrong path. A child or a loved one who is now deemed a threat? Infants that are human bombs should they become irate? Children and family hunted down, should it be decided that they are the 'wrong' race or religion while possessing such abilities. Real comics for real people in world turned upside down almost overnight.

With three #1 titles being released at the New York Comic Con, Nukleus is making its official maiden voyage into the thriving and changing world of independent comic book publishing. With the creative obstacles in good hands, the second hurdle to cover is the financial backing, and that is where this campaign plays one of the more critical roles. This is the fuel that will help us set sail and push these creations and the Nukleus brand out to the public to compete with, not only the Big Two, but the hundreds of other properties being released on a weekly basis. We are confident in our product and with your assistance, we will show you why it is a worthy investment. Any amount is acceptable because any amount is appreciated. Every dollar is a step and brings us closer to fulfilling our end of this venture.

Our Titles


The Boy from Planet A - An oddly mature speaking teenage boy shows up in 1979 Bronx, New York to solicit the help of two local heroes to secure a 'black box' (of sorts) that he claims hold the data of his dying planet that he calls ""Old Earth"" and that it surrounds everything on this planet. He even claims it could be Heaven to our own earth. Children do lie.This is the jump on point to the entire Nukleus universe. A must have.


NUKLEUS: 'Born Into This' - The follow up to 'The Boy from Planet A' and the repercussions that follow. A girl named Nikki has a secret. She decides to tell her best friend who can't hold water and has a penchant for trouble, but this is not a schoolyard secret. Its one that can unlock an interplanetary power source that takes the best or the worst in us and literally...well, check out the preview. (by Corey F Godwell)


Cold Shoulder - After being crime-free for nearly three decades New York is thrust into mayhem after its protector mysteriously disappears. It’s been five years since Swift Justice, the city’s omnipresent hero vanished and NYPD is clueless how to handle the surge in crime. Amidst the virtual lawlessness, a physically challenged, psychotic, alcoholic with a third of his torso covered in an organic steel, Cold Shoulder, turns hired gun to turn chaos into cash. After deciding to take a job to find a boys missing mother as a favor to a friend, he soon learns easy money ain’t so easy. (by Da'Shen)


Butterfly Sundae - Its 1981 America. Sklyab had fallen. Ronald Reagan is the President. Video hadn't yet killed radio. The nuclear threat still lingered. ""Adults cause way more s#!% than we kids do"". Meet Papillon, Butter, Chick P, Liz, Pristine, Oh!Donna and friends as they make their mark in the most decadent of times and thru the eyes, hearts and words of the boys who shaped their lives around winning the affections of these unique and mischievous girls.""We can do what we want and just go to confession on Sunday""(by F.Corey)



Wunderkind - In a not so distant future NYC, a small band of children unknowingly discover a wormhole deep within a sealed off portion of the New York City subway system that leads to nexus of all things. They discover a world that thrives on the imagination and dreams of everyone in the universe. A universal data bank, of sorts...and its been taken under siege by the benefactor children of a long dead universe who survive on consuming hope and dreams. Naturally, they have got to be stopped, but there is a price that these kids are not ready to pay. (A/W: CFGodwell)




What We Need & What You Get
Now, as you can see, we have set our goal at $5700. This is the nearly the bare minimum to fund decent sized small print runs of 200+ issues per book and that is 3 titles plus ashcans of to more titles. We also factored in the cost of a table at the New York Comic Con, posters, prints and to finance the sculpting of bust of one of the main characters (Nuklear Woman) that we will be accepting pre-orders for at the show. A nice portion of the pledge funds will go toward the sculptures artist fee. A third of it will go toward the production fees for the trade paperback/graphic novel of the collected 'Nukleus: Born Into This' that will be released Q1 of 2013. The remainder will go toward convention fees, in which NYC is the most expensive in the nation. In exchange for your help, you receive some nice gift packs loaded with an arsenal of goodies that allow us to show our gratitude. Indiegogo calls them 'perks'. Let me explain.

I'm Matt Warwick, an artist known as 'DrDubz', who for the past few years has been working on his debut comic series '<i>FERAL</i>'. It is packed full of awesome contemporary martial arts action and deep characters, setting it apart from most of the anthropomorphic character comics available. My goal is to make a great story that will be appreciated by anyone into action comics, even outside of the 'furry' circles. So far, two books in, it's certainly been the case.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442579122/hroamkmnnl0sjlmjp7nq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>If you wish to get a quick overview before reading, check out the <a href=""http://feral-comic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">official FERAL website</a>, where you can also purchase the books in paperback form.</p>
<p><i>FERAL </i>is the story of a proficient fighter and hustler named Hayley Rosa, who in previous two books has made huge leaps within the fighting circuit 'FERAL' in an incredibly short time, quickly breaking into the top tier. Despite this however, events unfold that take a toll on her confidence, and awaken her dangerous nature. </p>
<p>The third book in this series will follow the results of her now unbridled rage, and it's heavy cost. The narrative will now focus on Brandt's point of view, who's shown concern over Hayley's destructiveness, especially now that she has her sights set on his good friend and the circuit's number three, Krista Toporasku. Will Hayley overcome the challenge in her mentally fragile state? Or will she finally be broken by the fearless ex-soldier she now must face...<br/></p>

<p><i>FERAL</i> is an ongoing comic series that I have worked on yearly. It began late 2011 as a small experiment while living in Australia, starting as a 50 page taster for my abilities, to be sold at a convention in Melbourne. However, since its almost instant success due to its deep, interesting characters and intricately crafted fighting scenes, it has blown up exponentially. Some have even gone on to say that it's a hidden gem in the furry comic community that is over saturated with rom-coms, unnecessary sexual content and goofiness.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443478462/npqfcpusjmcuukbptbdo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>From the initial teaser to the two main books, both together totaling over 320 pages of martial arts action, <i>FERAL</i> is both my first foray into comics and also my greatest achievement to date. It's garnered much interest from furs and non-furs alike, and I am hoping that it paves the way for greater things in the future. It is not just me reaching out to a niche audience, but rather a genre and story that I have a passion for, as both an avid action cinema junkie, and martial arts practitioner. </div><div><br/></div><div>I have degrees in both moving image media (ND) and digital animation (BA with HONS), where my martial arts love also seeped into my final major project. Since then, I have used the knowledge gained to apply to comic art, where the two mediums share a common story telling aesthetic. This also gave my art a sense of motion, which has been a major advantage in getting the action in <i>FERAL</i> just right.</div><div>

Many have applauded it's fresh perspective on anthropomorphic comics, while others also appreciate being part of the comic itself as members of the crowd or more. Regardless of the reason, I could not be more thankful. </div><div><br/></div><div>Like the previous campaigns, the funding goals remain roughly the same. I require basic funds to cover the cost of self publishing, which are mostly printing costs for both the merchandise and books. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">While living costs are also factored in, </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">the initial $2000 will NOT be used for living expenses, rather it will be solely used for printing!</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> Anything else beyond the funding goal will be used to help cover unseen technical problems (like equipment failure etc), as well as extra merch ideas such as t-shirts.

</div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I am also coming clean. The A4 books that the last campaign promised will also need funding. I've decided to make a double compendium, both volumes 1 and 2 put together in a limited run of <b>300+ page A4 sized books, with colour pages included with the black and white</b>.

</div><div>In the end, everyone will be treated to Part 3 of <i>FERAL, </i>as well as other awesome perks. The perks in question range from the ever popular exclusive fight commissions, to the returning 'be in the book' slots that went like hot cakes for book 1. I'll also be including personalized desktop wallpapers for your computer, some awesome new merchandise, digital and physical copies of the books and other cool little digital goodies.

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Due to a few people also asking how they could help after the campaign, I have decided to opt into the 'InDemand' funding option on Indiegogo.

So much money!!! What do I do when I get excess funds? Well apart from using some of the money to register for major European conventions to spread the comic about, I'll also start up side projects, including a planned tabletop game based around the <i>FERAL</i> universe! Extra funds will also mean extra help, as I can then pay other artists to take the weight off my shoulders with inking.<ul> </ul> </div><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443971633/t4cb9vmcf0h12j2v5gee.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div><div>To give you an idea of what I'd need to pay out, here's a brief overview -</div><div>
<ul>
<li>at <b>$3500 </b>I'll be able to take on a second paid hand to help with the inking, so that the comic is shot out faster, allowing more time to add content and work on other things. $400 - 500 is a decent wage for an hour or two a day for a month, adding flat shades to pages. They can work this around their usual jobs or work, since they only ink pages as I finish them. I may have them do the work for longer than a month as well, so I'll need to keep on top of paying the artist for their hard and, frankly, tedious work.</li>
<li>at <b>$4500 </b>I'll be able to comfortably afford to register for Eurofurrence, which is the absolute biggest anthropomorphic fandom convention in Europe. I may also be able to allocate funds to set up for MCM in October of 2016, all depends on waiting lists and availability.</li>
<li>at <b>$6000 </b>I'll be able to start making prototypes for a possible <i>FERAL</i> tabletop game. This will allow the many people who've donated their characters to be in the comic and feature in perk commissions to actually be more involved as a fighter. It will be a mixture of role-playing combat and character building, a faster paced D&amp;D if you will, where you can develop your own fighter to be pit against your friends and of course, the <i>FERAL</i> elite. It is aiming to be accessible and quick to play for any level, but also rich and strategic, allowing for many types of players to emulate real life martial artists.</li>
</ul>
<div>As well as all that, I'll be able to spend more on merchandise for you all. More money, better product, everyone wins - <i>especially</i> you guys.</div>
</div><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443477887/ahcdc0khsyhoogq9fsdr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The risks are the same as last year, and now I can manage them much better. That doesn't mean that I get off with a 'get out of predicament free' card. All creators know they should assume that what can go wrong, will go wrong.</div><div><br/></div><div>
<ul>
<li>The biggest problem with a fully digital comic is equipment failure. Everything I work on is backed onto the Hard drive I bought with last campaign's money (which has served me reliably, an awesome piece of kit), so while all work is halted while I replace hardware, no data is lost. Hardware breaking will only result in delays, which will be shortened with a spare computer on hand and my tablet being fairly cheap to replace.</li>

<div>Frankly, as I have said before, even without the funding and despite the problems, <i>FERAL</i> will never become a dead project. Not mentioning the amount of time invested already to just give up, this has been a dream that I plan on seeing through to completion. Book 3 will be the mid-way point of the saga, so through Hell and high water, this is a project that I plan on completing, for myself and the fans I have gathered so far. </div>

</div>
</div></div>","Hey all! I'm Matt Warwick, an artist known as 'DrDubz', who for the past few years has been working on his debut comic series 'FERAL'. It is packed full of awesome contemporary martial arts action and deep characters, setting it apart from most of the anthropomorphic character comics available. My goal is to make a great story that will be appreciated by anyone into action comics, even outside of the 'furry' circles. So far, two books in, it's certainly been the case.


If you wish to get a quick overview before reading, check out the official FERAL website, where you can also purchase the books in paperback form.
FERAL is the story of a proficient fighter and hustler named Hayley Rosa, who in previous two books has made huge leaps within the fighting circuit 'FERAL' in an incredibly short time, quickly breaking into the top tier. Despite this however, events unfold that take a toll on her confidence, and awaken her dangerous nature. 
The third book in this series will follow the results of her now unbridled rage, and it's heavy cost. The narrative will now focus on Brandt's point of view, who's shown concern over Hayley's destructiveness, especially now that she has her sights set on his good friend and the circuit's number three, Krista Toporasku. Will Hayley overcome the challenge in her mentally fragile state? Or will she finally be broken by the fearless ex-soldier she now must face...


FERAL is an ongoing comic series that I have worked on yearly. It began late 2011 as a small experiment while living in Australia, starting as a 50 page taster for my abilities, to be sold at a convention in Melbourne. However, since its almost instant success due to its deep, interesting characters and intricately crafted fighting scenes, it has blown up exponentially. Some have even gone on to say that it's a hidden gem in the furry comic community that is over saturated with rom-coms, unnecessary sexual content and goofiness.

From the initial teaser to the two main books, both together totaling over 320 pages of martial arts action, FERAL is both my first foray into comics and also my greatest achievement to date. It's garnered much interest from furs and non-furs alike, and I am hoping that it paves the way for greater things in the future. It is not just me reaching out to a niche audience, but rather a genre and story that I have a passion for, as both an avid action cinema junkie, and martial arts practitioner. I have degrees in both moving image media (ND) and digital animation (BA with HONS), where my martial arts love also seeped into my final major project. Since then, I have used the knowledge gained to apply to comic art, where the two mediums share a common story telling aesthetic. This also gave my art a sense of motion, which has been a major advantage in getting the action in FERAL just right.


If you've been following the story so far, you will not want to miss this, as it is the start of Hayley's darkest chapter! If you're new, be sure to grab a book from the main website, or even simply grab the digital versions by supporting this campaign!

To echo what has been confirmed in the last two books, the fans are the reason this comic exists. Many have applauded it's fresh perspective on anthropomorphic comics, while others also appreciate being part of the comic itself as members of the crowd or more. Regardless of the reason, I could not be more thankful. Like the previous campaigns, the funding goals remain roughly the same. I require basic funds to cover the cost of self publishing, which are mostly printing costs for both the merchandise and books. While living costs are also factored in, the initial $2000 will NOT be used for living expenses, rather it will be solely used for printing! Anything else beyond the funding goal will be used to help cover unseen technical problems (like equipment failure etc), as well as extra merch ideas such as t-shirts. The excess will go on living, so I can focus more on the comic without being swamped in commissions, since art is my only job.
I am also coming clean. The A4 books that the last campaign promised will also need funding. I've decided to make a double compendium, both volumes 1 and 2 put together in a limited run of 300+ page A4 sized books, with colour pages included with the black and white. This will mean better value all around, and a more collectible product.$2000 makes about £1200 after Paypal takes it's cut. To break down approximate costs -

100x A5 books @ 160+ pages  - £250 - £300

25x A4 books @ 300+ pages - £230 - £250

25x A2 posters and 50x A3 posters - £100 - £120

Misc (stickers, postcards etc) - £150 - £250*

Postage - £300+ (wold-wide shipping can be expensive when books are involved.)


* Dependent on type of printers and product availability.

In the end, everyone will be treated to Part 3 of FERAL, as well as other awesome perks. The perks in question range from the ever popular exclusive fight commissions, to the returning 'be in the book' slots that went like hot cakes for book 1. I'll also be including personalized desktop wallpapers for your computer, some awesome new merchandise, digital and physical copies of the books and other cool little digital goodies. Last campaign, contributors got badge sized commissions, like the two shown below.

Book 2 was fully funded within 3 days of it being put up. It was insane, and I'm hoping that this time will be even more successful. Since I've now gotten used to the ins and outs of Manga Studio, book 3 will be made quicker and better than ever. I am now also aiming to allocate funds to help get me to more conventions to sell this comic to more people, which will hopefully be subsidized by sales of books 1 and 2.
Due to a few people also asking how they could help after the campaign, I have decided to opt into the 'InDemand' funding option on Indiegogo. If you want to donate, even if the campaign is over, this will allow you to. Though no perks will be available to contributors, I shall endeavor to provide some kind of compensation, such as access to the digital goodies and PDF comics etc. I might even throw you a little sketch if you start getting generous. Regardless, thankyou in advance if you believe in me enough to essentially become a patron.
IMPORTANT - ONCE YOU HAVE FUNDED THE CAMPAIGN BY SELECTING A PERK ABOVE $80, PROMPTLY SEND AN EMAIL TO - mightydubz@gmail.com - WITH REFS AND OTHER NECESSARY INFO!

So much money!!! What do I do when I get excess funds? Well apart from using some of the money to register for major European conventions to spread the comic about, I'll also start up side projects, including a planned tabletop game based around the FERAL universe! Extra funds will also mean extra help, as I can then pay other artists to take the weight off my shoulders with inking.  To give you an idea of what I'd need to pay out, here's a brief overview -

at $3500 I'll be able to take on a second paid hand to help with the inking, so that the comic is shot out faster, allowing more time to add content and work on other things. $400 - 500 is a decent wage for an hour or two a day for a month, adding flat shades to pages. They can work this around their usual jobs or work, since they only ink pages as I finish them. I may have them do the work for longer than a month as well, so I'll need to keep on top of paying the artist for their hard and, frankly, tedious work.
at $4500 I'll be able to comfortably afford to register for Eurofurrence, which is the absolute biggest anthropomorphic fandom convention in Europe. I may also be able to allocate funds to set up for MCM in October of 2016, all depends on waiting lists and availability.
at $6000 I'll be able to start making prototypes for a possible FERAL tabletop game. This will allow the many people who've donated their characters to be in the comic and feature in perk commissions to actually be more involved as a fighter. It will be a mixture of role-playing combat and character building, a faster paced D&D if you will, where you can develop your own fighter to be pit against your friends and of course, the FERAL elite. It is aiming to be accessible and quick to play for any level, but also rich and strategic, allowing for many types of players to emulate real life martial artists.

As well as all that, I'll be able to spend more on merchandise for you all. More money, better product, everyone wins - especially you guys.

The risks are the same as last year, and now I can manage them much better. That doesn't mean that I get off with a 'get out of predicament free' card. All creators know they should assume that what can go wrong, will go wrong.

The biggest problem with a fully digital comic is equipment failure. Everything I work on is backed onto the Hard drive I bought with last campaign's money (which has served me reliably, an awesome piece of kit), so while all work is halted while I replace hardware, no data is lost. Hardware breaking will only result in delays, which will be shortened with a spare computer on hand and my tablet being fairly cheap to replace.
Speaking of delays, the deadline for the comics is the 25th May 2016, in time for the major British furry convention, Confuzzled. Last time I barely made it, due to wrestling with programs and printing schedules on short notice. This time, now that I'm fully trained with the programs and have templates at the ready, I should be able to get the third book done with time to spare.
Since I still have to live, I will need to allocate time for commissions work on the side. This can eat up valuable comic production time, which hopefully the campaign's funding should be able to subsidies till the bulk of the work is done, such as all the rough layout and some inking. I am also looking into getting paid help again to assist inking, like last time, to take weight off my shoulders.


Frankly, as I have said before, even without the funding and despite the problems, FERAL will never become a dead project. Not mentioning the amount of time invested already to just give up, this has been a dream that I plan on seeing through to completion. Book 3 will be the mid-way point of the saga, so through Hell and high water, this is a project that I plan on completing, for myself and the fans I have gathered so far. 

Times are hard, I understand. Doesn't make you any less entitled to jumping on this awesome ride, so if you want to help out, simply spread the word and hype the project up! I mean there's a lot to be hyped about, after all.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>MAS Media Studios is an independent publisher established back in 2007 by three guys who wanted to bring something to the comic book world that was more than just super heroes in tights. A few years back we were able to print a small run of a graphic novel entitled Street Journal. The book sold well so we decided to reprint the novel with a larger print run and a new dynamic cover. To do so, however, we need your help.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking to put together $3000. This will cover printing costs, paying an artist for a shnazzy cover and a promotional budget to be able to raise awareness of the project.</p>
<p>As a contributor, you will receive great perks that include original artwork, unique laminated prints, sketch cards, and if that's not enough, we are also throwing in the  limited edition first prints of the graphic novel signed by the crew!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Street Journal is unlike any other comic book in that it gives a real portrayal of one young man's push to build a new life for his two year old daughter. Each person has an obstacle to over come, Tyreke Miles becomes that literal living testament and for many, we believe a symbol of hope. Through your contributions, our goal is to print and release this book so that young indivuduals can be inspired to find their own purpose inspite of their environment and push on. Plus, it's a fun read.</p>

Tecnicamente sarei uno sceneggiatore ma, spesso, mi ritrovo a fare storie scritte e disegnate da me. Quindi sono un autore completo… come completo è il disastro dei miei disegni. Già, non so disegnare. Però pare che questi disegni funzionino con le cose che racconto. PARE eh, mica lo so se è vero… ai posteri l’ardua senza (dannati posteri, sempre lì pronti a giudicare).Comunque:Un giorno mi sono detto: “Davide, perché non illustri, male, tutta la Divina Commedia di Dante Alighieri?”. Ok, ho deciso che la illustro tutta. Però un libro alla volta. Quindi eccomi qui a presentarvi la prima cantica: “L’inferno”.  Ok, so cosa state pensando: “Perché dovrei comprare un libro che è già stato illustrato da Gustave Dorè?”. Per due motivi:1) Dorè era bravo a disegnare, facile illustrare quando si è bravi a disegnare. Provate voi ad essere incapace e illustrare 34 canti (anzi 33+1… che fa sempre 34 ma Dante, pare, preferisse così).2) Dorè è morto.Il libro, brossurato, sarà di circa 200 pagine in bianco e nero.

A skilled artisan can craft words to evoke feelings and emotions from its recipients. (Although not all words mean the same thing to everyone!)
Word Smith is written and created by Stephen Kok, artwork by P.R. Dedelis and coloured by Peyton Freeman. This creative team has worked successfully and delivered on multiple projects without any problems!  If you love anything steampunk, thrilling stories and awesome characters, you will love Word Smith!
 
Word Smith Volume 1 is a 52 page graphic novel. Word Smith Volume 2 will be a 60 page (Final page count to be confirmed) full coloured, perfect bound graphic novel (with a spine!). It will be 260mm x 170mm (10.2"" x 6.7"") in size and printed on 150gsm internal pages with a 250gsm cardstock cover with cello glazing. (For those unfamiliar with paper gsm, I'm a little bit of a paper snob and this is high quality paper! ) 
 
Word Smith Volume 1 :
When a word that Victoria crafts goes awry can she fix it or will she end up making matters worse?

Word Smith Volume 2 :
Victoria is the best word smith in the city, however a challenger from the Eastern Nations might steal Victoria's title! There's adventure, excitement and of course, lots of words.

I am the Husband to my beautiful wife Terrian King and the Father to two beautiful daughters. Astoria who is 2 and Kyree who is 11. I currently work at a grocery store as a cashier but I am chasing my true passion which is writing and creating. I am currently writing two titles, Abigail and F*ck This. </p><p>Brandon Smith is the Co-creator and Co-writer for the team. He is passionate about writing and brings a lot of creativity to the team.</p><p>Terrian King is the customer service manager and HR. She brings everything about customer service and the business ends of things, She will make sure to take care of any questions you may have about the campaign.</p><p>We have been making appearances at cons at comic book shops over the past year and plan on never stopping. We want to make this company as big as possible and bring amazing stories to you.</p><p><strong>WHY CROWDFUNDING?</strong></p><p>We want to use Indiegogo to bring a quality campaign to you and focus on moving forward with our ongoing series. The book is done and we want to use this to take it to the printer. The profit made will be put into making book 2 happen. We already have Shelby Robertson ready to jump on in for interiors for the next project. </p><p><strong>ABIGAIL'S STORY</strong></p><p>In a time of such suffering, the only thing that matters is becoming ascended. Children train day in and day out in hopes of being chosen to join the ranks of the Angels. Once a year, the Gods send their Angels down from Heaven to pick up those lucky enough to have been chosen to train them for ascension. Once ascended, they will become Angels themselves and serve the lords above controlling the surface world below as they see fit.<br/><br/><br/>The lucky few Angels who have proven their worth are honored with the opportunity of becoming Archangels. Very few are ever chosen to take on this glorified position. The responsibility of an Archangel is to oversee the actions of the Angels and combat the Forces of Darkness rising on the surface.<br/><br/><br/>The Forces of Darkness are those who resist the Gods and tear the wings from the angels. They will do anything in there power to resist the tyranny of the Gods above, even if it means creating their demons to rise against heaven. The Forces of Darkness will call forth the deadliest sins and strongest of the fallen to take back what they believe is rightfully theirs.<br/><br/><br/>The Government has found the secret to immortal life and wanted nothing more than to make the world great again in their image. It all began 83 years ago when the self-proclaimed new Gods unleashed a virus upon the world while they escaped to their new world above, Heaven. The only way to cure this plague was to bow down and praise the new gods as their saviors. The fear and rage of the infected sparked the devastating 15-Year War. This brutal and seemingly endless war left the surface world in rubble and ruin. Those who chose to bend the knee and praise the new Gods were granted asylum in safe zones, truly a testament to the love and generosity of the Gods. The protection of these numbered safe zones, each dubbed an ‘Eden’, lies with the Angels.<br/><br/><br/>Abigail’s journey begins in her home, Eden-6, where she and her fellow chosen have trained their whole lives with one goal in mind, to rise through the ranks and become mighty Archangels themselves.</p><p><strong>REVIEWS FROM THE FANS</strong></p><p><strong>""Awesome story brilliant colors killer artwork.""</strong> - Chris Mason</p><p><strong>""I HIGHLY recommend Sacred Chaos and Abigail #1!

<h3>Story</h3>
<p>Rosemari Susan Oppenheimer is the pilot of the <i>Hermit Crab,</i> a one-of-a-kind set of Power Armor engineered with a myriad of optional loadouts to accommodate any job. Mari earns her living as a Contractor, solving problems for anyone willing to pay for her services: Mining, transportation, protection, sometimes even conflict resolution.</p>
<p>Although able to project a veil of professionalism toward her clients, Mari is actually naive, irresponsible, imprudent, and downright derpy - at least according to her mentor, the mad genius, Dr. Masaka. Retiring soon, he insists on imparting a critical lesson to his protege: That although she inherited incredible technological advantages from her estranged father, the universe won't simply step aside for Mari. If she isn't able to adapt to a ever-changing world (and take better care of her equipment) she will find herself quickly overwhelmed and depleted of resources.</p>

<p>Mari travels a foreign universe in a reliable (if clunky) cruiser with her pet/co-pilot, the foxy Bork. Her universe is very different than others: It resembles a swirling galactic soup, an ocean, something one might see under a microscope. There are gas clusters with breathable air, chunks of inhabitable floating rock and soil rather than planets. There is always somewhere interesting to visit, and countless clients seeking the services of a professional problem-solver.</p>

<strong>Tone &amp; Setting:</strong><p>Mari Sue is a love letter to 80's and 90's anime: Filthy alleyways drenched in neon. Mech pilots conducting business in cities overrun with corruption. Sleazy swindlers rubbing elbows with duplicitous, seductive babes. Danger around every corner. Desperate citizens who will stab anyone in the back for a few bucks.</p>
<p>The universe of this story, <i>Ouranos,</i> is a dense sandbox. There are countless planets, planes, and ""clusters"" of inhabitable space for lifeforms to thrive upon, cradled in colorful clouds and intimidating heavenly phenomena. Each location will be lovingly rendered, prioritizing visual pleasure over realism.</p>
<p>This story will feature thrilling exo-suit battles, bizarre creatures, a fine cast of characters to befriend, dastardly enemies to despise, and dozens of rich settings you'll want to visit.</p>
<p><strong>Episodes 1 &amp; 2</strong><br/>Presented as a pair, the first two issues of this series will take place on a cruise ship, focusing on a handful of seminal events in Mari's life.

<p>The Dominus is the story of six childhood friends who reunite as adults and embark on an adventure to protect the Holy Grail from the Antichrist.  Through their adventure, they are drawn into the eternal struggle between good and evil, face death, and become ‘blessed’ with unique abilities and powers. The Dominus is a 96 page full color original graphic novel.  It is intended for mature audiences with violence and mild profanity.   </p>
<p>The story picks up on the night of a reunion between the six friends who grew up together at Saint Christopher’s Orphanage in Long Island, New York.  They are reminded of a story from their childhood involving a hidden land inside the Himalayas where the Holy Grail was kept in secret, guarded by an ancient race called the Peregrinus.  Upon hearing that name, memories are triggered among the group involving incredible things they could do as children while at the orphanage. </p>
<p>As the group tries to make sense of these new memories, they are joined by their old priest who implores them to go on a quest with him to the Himalayas, where they must become the frightening power of good to protect the Grail from an ancient evil that seeks to possess it.</p>

<p>From your first day of pre-school to your last day of high school teachers and parents instill the belief that you have to go to college to get a good education and be successful. Then you go to college and study a specific major and upon graduation most people have a plan to take life by the horns, just one problem... Life doesn't always want to be taken. Most college graduates in today's society find themselves in student-loan debt and are lucky if they can get a job in their major. Most grads need to find a job in any field just to gain ""experience"" and get a steady pay-check to pay off their loans. </p>
<h2>COSMIC- Back Story</h2>
<p>Landon Debson moved to Los Angeles with dreams of being an actor after he graduated college with a degree in Acting. He quickly learned that not all goals in life could be accomplished, especially when nobody has heard of you and barely any companies are hiring. After a year of interviewing, Landon finally got a call-back from “UPA” for a “S.T.A.R.” position! Little did he know that he ""UPA"" actually stands for ""Universal Protection Agency"", and his new job is far from acting! Landon has now signed a five year contract, bonded by his life, to be a “S.T.A.R.”, “Soldier Through All Radii”. Landon Debson thought his position was to be an actor, but the contract was really for a career as a universal superhero known as <i>Cosmic</i>. Landon is officially, and reluctantly, a Soldier Through All Radii, sworn to protect Earth from universal dangers, pirates and creatures. Landon is not quite ready for such responsibility in his life, but needs to keep this job to pay off his student-loan debt. After all, nobody else is hiring.</p>
<p>COSMIC is a comic series for all ages.</p>
<h2>COSMIC- Issues 1 &amp; 2 </h2>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span><em> Cosmic</em> is faced with the task of protecting the infants of Earth from the alien pirate “Captain Priam” and his crew of baby snatchers!</span></h3>
<p>Our story begins a year into Landon's tenure as <i>Cosmic</i> as he will be faced with the challenge of defending Earth's infants from a crew of alien space-pirates led by Captain Priam. Priam and his crew are now looking to abduct babies in order to turn them into soldiers in his army of pirates. </p>

Then you go to college and study a specific major and upon graduation most people have a plan to take life by the horns, just one problem... Life doesn't always want to be taken. Most college graduates in today's society find themselves in student-loan debt and are lucky if they can get a job in their major. Most grads need to find a job in any field just to gain ""experience"" and get a steady pay-check to pay off their loans. 
COSMIC- Back Story
Landon Debson moved to Los Angeles with dreams of being an actor after he graduated college with a degree in Acting. He quickly learned that not all goals in life could be accomplished, especially when nobody has heard of you and barely any companies are hiring. After a year of interviewing, Landon finally got a call-back from “UPA” for a “S.T.A.R.” position! Little did he know that he ""UPA"" actually stands for ""Universal Protection Agency"", and his new job is far from acting! Landon has now signed a five year contract, bonded by his life, to be a “S.T.A.R.”, “Soldier Through All Radii”. Landon Debson thought his position was to be an actor, but the contract was really for a career as a universal superhero known as Cosmic. Landon is officially, and reluctantly, a Soldier Through All Radii, sworn to protect Earth from universal dangers, pirates and creatures. Landon is not quite ready for such responsibility in his life, but needs to keep this job to pay off his student-loan debt. After all, nobody else is hiring.
COSMIC is a comic series for all ages.
COSMIC- Issues 1 & 2 
 Cosmic is faced with the task of protecting the infants of Earth from the alien pirate “Captain Priam” and his crew of baby snatchers!
Our story begins a year into Landon's tenure as Cosmic as he will be faced with the challenge of defending Earth's infants from a crew of alien space-pirates led by Captain Priam. Priam and his crew are now looking to abduct babies in order to turn them into soldiers in his army of pirates.

Hey Gang,

that don't know me, my name is C.H.Ng. I've been a fan of comics most
of my life, and throughout my love of comics, roleplaying and gaming, I've always had these stories waiting to get out, whether it was work, heartbreak, trying better at drawing, these stories still called out to be told.And I have not just sit with wishful thinking of seeing my stories crystalize. Previously I have published hardcopy comics with works like "" Fate of Three Kingdoms""  and ""Roshido"" Short Story ( Tales of the Onin War ). You can visit CH-Ng.com to have a view of my earlier works. Most of these previous projects are self funded and the return I got was merely below break even point ! Getting funds to propel my future works has become increasingly difficult as I need to strike a balance between passion and my Bread & Butter. Thanks to sites like Indiegogo, it really was a no brainer to just go ahead
and tell my tales! With the help of crowdfunding my next dream might actually be realized. And with your help I hope to share my next dream
with you!! This dream is to publish my '""Sherman"" story in comic book form, and
maybe one day lead to bigger things in the future! I want you to join me here
at the inception. Be introduced to characters and world of Sherman - A Robot / Mecha Superhero.The title of this book ""Sherman"" is in actual fact the name of an American battle tank that was deployed during the Second World War. Base on historical records, Sherman is a well rounded medium tank with good mobility, speed and firepower.These advantages along with it's relative ease of production had made her the primary U.S tanks and it had given the US army a numerical superiority over the Axis. Sherman were removed from the frontline after the korean war and thus mark an end to this legendary tank. While brainstorming for the robot character design, I made constant references to the picturial details of a Sherman Tank Model and incorporate them into the Tank-Man final sketch. This comic book will
put a smile on your faces, and entertain you. My hope is to have you fall in
love with my characters and want to spend time in the world that they take
place in. What Are NeededThe Sherman Short Story is already completed and is now being sent for editorial process. My Goal is to get a funding of $2000. What does it cover? Mainly printing!
And shipping and the Booth Expenses for Comic Convention in Singapore. If the goal of $2000 is reached, there will be a book launch and an exhibition at the Singapore Toy, Games and Comics Convention 2014. STGCC is a major comic event in Singapore and the best place to introduce new comic product to a large crowd.
If the funding goal exceed $2000, an additional larger
print run will be considered based on pre-orders. 
If the goal of $2000 is not reach through crowd funding, all perks will still be provided and I'll use on line marketing and print on demand to get this book out to the world. The deadline is September 2014.What You Get
To the minimum contributors get at least a Sherman digital copy in PDF format.The Artist Signed Hardcopy Book :

Paperback - A5 Size
Black and White Art
plus Sherman Concept Art & Sketches
Approximately 64 pages
I hope most people will choose to get a physical copy. There
is nothing like actually having the comic book in your hand. More details in
the perks section. Furthermore you can own some of my previous comics works like  "" Fate of Three Kingdoms""  ( 220 pgs ) and ""Roshido -Tales of the Onin War ( 42 pgs ) if you decide to choose anything above the Collector Perk. Hence you can actually get a value package of more stories by contributing more. I include here a video of these works for your view. If you are interested to find out more of my other works simply go to my website at CH-Ng.com.Other Ways You Can HelpTweet

<div>""Ladies &amp; Gentlemen"" is the brainchild of myself (Richard Worth) and my buddy Jordan Collver (a real Canadian!). It's a silver age style comic about a group of Victorian crime fighters.

<p>Barking Bad is going to sweep you off your feet and take you
on a journey that will spark your curiosity and leave you wanting to find out what is lurking in those back alleys and dog parks.  You'll never know unless you're willing to take a walk on the WILD side.... </p>

<p>When Brock Wurst (a.k.a. The Big Sausage), a gruff, older Dachshund and Top Dog of the New Jersey Canine Cartel, discovers the Canadian Cartel’s Top Dog, Mr. Labatzki, a sinister, older Rottweiler, is selling “treats” (drugs) on his turf, Brock declares war on him and his younger business partner, Blue, a scrappy Irish Terrier.</p>
<p>This leads Brock, his gang of “made” mongrels and family on a sinful and erotically captivating journey of jaw-dropping twists and unexpected betrayals, involving constant conflict with the authorities and adversaries. Queenie, his sly and devoted wife, supports Brock’s illegal doings to ensure her lavish lifestyle, while Rocco and Lulu, their two teenage kids are constantly barking down the wrong alleys. And as they lick their wounds, these lovable anti-heroes manage to capture our hearts.</p>

Barking Bad is a comic book reflection of my vivid imagination, love for animals, fondness for mafia movies, and some hilarious misadventures (somewhat exaggerated) as a former private investigator in Los Angeles, the City of Angels, where everyone is decidedly not angelic.</p>

 It started out as a whimsical, fun project that I wanted my son, Shawn,
who is a talented illustrator and animator, (and Saturday morning cartoon addict) to draw as a comic book. But the more I
developed the characters, the more my imagination ran wild. That’s when I knew I could never let
these “sleeping dogs lie,"" and I've spent the past two years developing this continuing saga of unending havoc in the lives of my colorful characters.

<p>
My desire is to have this story published as an ongoing
Graphic Novel series. But my DREAM is to bring these characters to life someday via

<p>
</p>
<p>By incorporating themes from successful shows like The Sopranos, The

<p>The characters are both mature and young, and likeable and

Barking Bad is going to sweep you off your feet and take you
on a journey that will spark your curiosity and leave you wanting to find out what is lurking in those back alleys and dog parks.  You'll never know unless you're willing to take a walk on the WILD side.... 





When Brock Wurst (a.k.a. The Big Sausage), a gruff, older Dachshund and Top Dog of the New Jersey Canine Cartel, discovers the Canadian Cartel’s Top Dog, Mr. Labatzki, a sinister, older Rottweiler, is selling “treats” (drugs) on his turf, Brock declares war on him and his younger business partner, Blue, a scrappy Irish Terrier.
This leads Brock, his gang of “made” mongrels and family on a sinful and erotically captivating journey of jaw-dropping twists and unexpected betrayals, involving constant conflict with the authorities and adversaries. Queenie, his sly and devoted wife, supports Brock’s illegal doings to ensure her lavish lifestyle, while Rocco and Lulu, their two teenage kids are constantly barking down the wrong alleys. And as they lick their wounds, these lovable anti-heroes manage to capture our hearts.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>A medieval adventure where warriors must join forces, caught in the center of an epic battle between angels and demons.</strong></p>
<h1>
<strong>Welcome to the first issue of The Tribulations of Abaddon</strong>!</h1>
<p>As humanity prospers and kingdoms grow, the balance of good and evil shifts into chaos when the demon Syria escapes from the dark bowels of Hell. On Earth, the Sumerian city of Larsa begins to consume itself as a demonic plague begins to spread at an overwhelming rate.

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>FROM THE CREATOR:</strong></p>
<p>Hey everyone! My name is David Sandoval, and I am here to ask for your help in making the first issue of “The Tribulations of Abaddon” a reality. The journey to produce this fantastic tale has been a long one. I’ve been working on T.O.A. for a few years, and in the process of development I came together with a fantastic team of artists who have helped me create this labor of love.</p>
<p><span><img alt=""The Human Warriors"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/216357_524839614219195_1764936246_n.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Meet the Cast""/></span></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This is where you can help. I’ve been personally funding the creative production of this book, but I can’t do it alone -- and producing the physical comic is a financial challenge in itself. We’re looking forward to getting this story out to comic fans everywhere, so we can show everyone what an epic adventure we’ve created. We’re hoping to find enough support to make this a successful Kickstarter and make the book happen. We’ve gotten some great reactions from our fellow creators, artists and fans in the industry, so we’re even more excited than ever about bringing this comic to you.</p>
<p>One of the things about self-publishing that isn’t often spoken about, is the expenses. When I got into writing, I never imagined myself putting together a comic.Two years later, here I am and the most difficult thing isn’t finding the talent, it’s paying for quality work.</p>
<p>I decided to try Indiegogo to not only help pay the artists for their hard work on the book, but to actually get it into people’s hands in both print and digital format. I started N.A.S Studios for this very reason: I love telling stories. I have actually been working on developing the story of The Tribulations of Abaddon for over five years; finally I got the script to where I wanted it. Being a history buff as well as a huge fantasy and horror fan, I took all that I loved and turned it into this epic adventure.</p>
<p>If you love monsters, demons, barbarians, sword fighting and beautiful women, then helping to fund the production of The Tribulations of Abaddon is for you. And lets not forget all of the awesome REWARDS we have lined up for you guys.</p>
<p><span>The funding ($3000) will be used to help pay for the interior sequential art, which includes: pencils by Kris Cagle, inks by Juan Albarran, colors by Tommy Shelton, lettering by Kel Nuttall, post-production graphic design by Raymond Dowaliby, and the printing and Distribution of T.O.A. #1 </span><br/><br/><span>This first issue will have 24 pages of story as well as 8 pages of bonus materials including concept sketches and pinup art.

<p><em>“The Tribulations of Abaddon is one of those rare projects that comes along and combines everything I love about high fantasy in the comic medium.

<p><em>""T.O.A. is a BIG story... Big, over-sized people shooting off their big, over-sized mouths in a big, over-sized adventure! Feeding T.O.A.'s 'bigness' however, is a deep pool of subtlety.</em><em>The characters are relevant, original and complex, and the settings are familiar enough to be engaging without being predictable. T.O.A.'s dialogue is loaded with humor and emotion, while remaining happily free of the campy bulls**t that is the lingua franca of modern Sword and Sorcery. </em><em>The script paints crystal clear pictures -- I wish I were the artist drawing it! Its going to be a fun, epic saga and I can't wait to see it all come together!""</em>                                                <strong>-</strong><strong>Steve Firchow (artist/colorist for Top Cow, DC, Marvel)</strong></p>

The Impact


What's been said about The Story (The Tribulations of Abaddon)
“The Tribulations of Abaddon is one of those rare projects that comes along and combines everything I love about high fantasy in the comic medium. N.A.S Studios is putting together an incredible tale of sword, sorcery, angels and demons and I am very excited to be involved in helping to bring this to life!”    - Patrick Blaine (penciler/artist for Top Cow, Dark Horse, DC)
“TOA… monsters, demons, hot women, badass men. And a great storyline to boot! I am looking forward to my involvement with this project.""- Kevin Conrad (inker/artist for Image, DC)
""T.O.A. is a BIG story... Big, over-sized people shooting off their big, over-sized mouths in a big, over-sized adventure! Feeding T.O.A.'s 'bigness' however, is a deep pool of subtlety.The characters are relevant, original and complex, and the settings are familiar enough to be engaging without being predictable. T.O.A.'s dialogue is loaded with humor and emotion, while remaining happily free of the campy bulls**t that is the lingua franca of modern Sword and Sorcery. The script paints crystal clear pictures -- I wish I were the artist drawing it! Its going to be a fun, epic saga and I can't wait to see it all come together!""                                                -Steve Firchow (artist/colorist for Top Cow, DC, Marvel)


Everyone at N.A.S Studios is putting in there heart and soul to this project. 
Having worked on this story for a few years and having one of the best teams I've had the privilege of working with I feel TOA is a story that not only will it be noticed but will stand out with its great cover art and epic story telling.

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>My name is Brandon and I'm an Illustration graduate from Massachusetts college of Art and Design. I live in Massachusetts, just north of boston and I love to draw. I've been drawing since I was about 5 and trying to make comics for just as long. I've always been attracted to story and feel a natural affinity to try and tell stories.</p>
<p>Match, to date, is my first comic completely created on my own. I did all of the drawing, the inking, lettering and editing myself. It started as a project while I was at massart to create a comic and post a page regularily every friday as a way to discipline myself. It took hours of writing and rewriting script pages and finding the right models for my characters but once I sat down and began to draw it finally all felt right.</p>
<p>For its successes and failures, Match is still very close to me. It's my first completed story, a story thats defined my voice, my style and other stories I'm writing for the future. It's my ultimate dream and goal to have a printed version, with all my extras in tow that I couldnt have dreamed to have in one collection. It would mean so much to me to have the hard copy to go to comic cons with and promote my work. I feel like it would strengthen my presence as a young Illustrator.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and for reading!</p>
<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Details</h3>
<p>The comic itself will cost me $900 to print and bind into trade paperback(not counting the cost of shipping). It's a difficult goal to meet on my own so any contribution would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>As a special thank you, I'm going to include bonuses for different levels of contribution!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
With the comic already completed in digital format it would be so powerful to see in a complete printed format. To include all of the extras that I've worked on and have it all together for the first time would be very integral to making my first steps in the comic industry. It would open the doors to artist gallery and vendor tables at local cons and help build relationships with other local creators.</div>

I'm the writer/creator of the new fantasy comic <b>Chronicles of a Necromancer</b>, and I've loved reading &amp; writing since I can remember. This story is about a female college student who discovers that she is a necromancer.

I know you'll love it :). </h4><p>This campaign is to complete <b>Volume 1</b>, which means <b><i>Issues 2-7</i></b>. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I've written out the scripts for all issues of Volume 1, which means all we need is the minimum amount of money ($6,300 USD) to proceed to finish the first batch. <i>Note: I do have plans to create <b>Volume 2</b>, and I already have the overarching story outlined.</i> </span></p><h3><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Why is this campaign only Vol. 1?</b></h3><ul>
<li>
<b>Feasibility - </b>It is more feasible to create 6 comic books first since it is a grueling process for the artist. To save you and me some $ I hired someone who is excellent at what he does and is also multi-talented. He not only does the artwork. He also does the coloring and lettering for the comics. Usually, you'd hire someone for each of these tasks, but that would greatly increase costs. </li>
<li>
<b>Story Potential -</b> I love creating these characters. They truly speak to me, and it's funny how I can finish writing one or two comics in a day if my muses are there and the time is right. The thing is, I can love these characters 'til death do us part, but the real <i>firework</i> event is when you guys love them, as well. For that reason, I chose to wait and see what kind of reaction I get from readers and fans before proceeding to the next volume of comic books. If Volume 1 exceeds my expectations in terms of the response I get, I promise you that the next volume will be BIGGER and BETTER!!!</li>
<li>
<b>Room for Improvement -</b> As in all creative projects, there is always room for improvement. By only creating Vol. 1 first I am able to pause afterward and see what the reaction is from readers/fans so that when I start Volume 2 I can make the necessary changes and improvements to the story and the presentation of the comic book. </li>
</ul><h1><b>CHARITY: For every Issue 1 sold through this campaign TWO digital comics will be donated to the non-profit organization Comics For Kids (@comics4_kids). They help underprivileged children, as well as those with special needs, by providing them with the BEST GIFT: a comic book.

You know when you like something. No questions asked! Any support will be MUCH appreciated. This includes retweeting @MythicJose, telling your friends, liking my Facebook page (<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/chroniclesofanecromancer"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>www.facebook.com/chroniclesofanecromancer</b></a>), and basically showing any sign of support! Even a message of ""I love the project"" keeps me motivated! hehe ^_^</h3><p><b>Budget</b></p><p>Most of the money will be going directly to paying the professional comic artist. As mentioned before, I hired someone who is excellent at what he does and is also multi-talented. He not only does the artwork. He also does the coloring and lettering for the comics. Usually, you'd hire someone for each of these tasks, but that would greatly increase costs. </p><p>I will NEVER use the money received in this campaign for personal use. All expenses are to ensure the comic is made, advertised and promoted in the best way possible. </p><p>If we receive even more money than we need for the minimum expenses, I want to assure you that we WILL put that money to good use. We will spend that money on marketing to further increase the value of your investment.</p><h2><b>Thank You<br/></b></h2><h3>Thank you for donating your time and money! It means THE WORLD 2 me :).

Not only that, but...SPOILER ALERT...she seems to share some kind of metaphysical relationship with the Greek gods. This is a tale of mystery, magic, love and - of course - fantasy! Themes Present: 
Female Empowerment
Coming of Age
Darkness and Light
I have worked very hard to save up money so that I could provide Issue 1 right away to you guys! Glenn has done a FANTASTIC job, and I can't wait to have you guys read it! I know you'll love it :). This campaign is to complete Volume 1, which means Issues 2-7. I've written out the scripts for all issues of Volume 1, which means all we need is the minimum amount of money ($6,300 USD) to proceed to finish the first batch. Note: I do have plans to create Volume 2, and I already have the overarching story outlined. Why is this campaign only Vol. 1?

Feasibility - It is more feasible to create 6 comic books first since it is a grueling process for the artist. To save you and me some $ I hired someone who is excellent at what he does and is also multi-talented. He not only does the artwork. He also does the coloring and lettering for the comics. Usually, you'd hire someone for each of these tasks, but that would greatly increase costs. 

Story Potential - I love creating these characters. They truly speak to me, and it's funny how I can finish writing one or two comics in a day if my muses are there and the time is right. The thing is, I can love these characters 'til death do us part, but the real firework event is when you guys love them, as well. For that reason, I chose to wait and see what kind of reaction I get from readers and fans before proceeding to the next volume of comic books. If Volume 1 exceeds my expectations in terms of the response I get, I promise you that the next volume will be BIGGER and BETTER!!!

Room for Improvement - As in all creative projects, there is always room for improvement. By only creating Vol. 1 first I am able to pause afterward and see what the reaction is from readers/fans so that when I start Volume 2 I can make the necessary changes and improvements to the story and the presentation of the comic book. 
CHARITY: For every Issue 1 sold through this campaign TWO digital comics will be donated to the non-profit organization Comics For Kids (@comics4_kids). They help underprivileged children, as well as those with special needs, by providing them with the BEST GIFT: a comic book. For more info: https://www.facebook.com/ComicsforkidsJust remember the kid in you and don't hesitate! You know when you like something. No questions asked! Any support will be MUCH appreciated. This includes retweeting @MythicJose, telling your friends, liking my Facebook page (www.facebook.com/chroniclesofanecromancer), and basically showing any sign of support! Even a message of ""I love the project"" keeps me motivated! hehe ^_^BudgetMost of the money will be going directly to paying the professional comic artist. As mentioned before, I hired someone who is excellent at what he does and is also multi-talented. He not only does the artwork. He also does the coloring and lettering for the comics. Usually, you'd hire someone for each of these tasks, but that would greatly increase costs. I will NEVER use the money received in this campaign for personal use. All expenses are to ensure the comic is made, advertised and promoted in the best way possible. If we receive even more money than we need for the minimum expenses, I want to assure you that we WILL put that money to good use. We will spend that money on marketing to further increase the value of your investment.Thank YouThank you for donating your time and money! It means THE WORLD 2 me :). And know that no matter how much you pay, you TRULY have made a DIFFERENCE!!!Credits (video):SFX

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello Comic Fans!</p>
<p>My name is Ray Whitcher and I'm from South Africa (yup, that tiny country right at the bottom of the Africa). My friend Moray Rhoda and I were invited by the San Diego Comic Convention to present our panel: <span style=""font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;""><strong>The Velocity Anthology - Comic Art of Africa and Australia </strong>on Thursday the 18th of July at 6:30pm. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"">Moray is the South African Publisher of the anthology and I am one of the administrators of the South African Arts forum Legionink.com. Together, our organisations have strived to create a viable and high-quality comic output in collaboration with Neville Howard, who is based in Australia and publishes the anthology there. I am a scholar of comic adaptation theory (with research outputs published in <em>The Arts in Media</em> journal) and Moray is a designer and part-time lecturer in Cape Town, and is a member of the TDT comic group as well as being co-founder of Velocity Anthology with Neville Howard. We are extremely passionate and dedicated to our cause, and when presented with the opportunity to showcase the work of South Africa and Australia and demonstrate the international standards of our artistic outputs. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"">This is a MASSIVE achievement for us, as it will be a South African first to present a panel at SDCC, especially because we've been given a slot on the openining night. We've also been given a 90minute-long slot, which is an honour in of itself!<br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"">We do have a slight problem though... We only received notification of our acceptance to the panels yesterday and have had no chance to organise funding to get to San Diego, hence doing this crowd-funding initiative.<br/></span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Right, so to get to nitty-gritty, Moray and I are both lecturers and hence not exactly in the best of financial means to pay for air tickets. So we're looking to raise approximately $5000 to cover our travel expenses. If we get more, that'd be AMAZING!</p>
<p>It's really just to pay for our flights as Moray and I will sort out our own accommodation fees. We'll happily list you as a contributor to the initiative and add you in to our presentation. I will also be happy to blog/vlog/tweet for any major corporates that sponsor us as well. (Obviously this would be more beneficial to South African and Australian organisations that wouldn't normally have access to this convention).</p>
<p>We'll be taking the Anthology with us and will be showing it to the big boys like Marvel, DC, Image and Dark Horse as well as network with publishers we love such as IDW, Dynamite Entertainment and UK's Com-X. We hope to expose South African and Australian comic artists as extensively as possible.</p>
<p>We will use every cent that we raise to get there, even if we don't make our target, so any donation big or small would be massively beneficial!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Moray and I will keep an updated blog running on our experience at SDCC and I'd be very keen to do a feature on Cosplay as well. Once we've returned, I am going to be writing and contributing new research outputs about Comics in South Africa and how to take them further. Our panel will hopefully also open the door to many previously underexposed Australian and South African artists and show the world what we're made of.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
If you can't afford to help us financially, please feel free to spread this campaign around as much as possible, especially if you know of any corporates or potential sponsors that'd be keen to help! We'd be eternally grateful to you. :)</div></div>","Short Summary
Hello Comic Fans!

<p>     Autumn Grey is my personal journey as a comic writer and artist. It has grown over the years and changed along with my life in the comic industry. I'm proud to introduce issue #8 and would love for you to take the journey with me.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590684262/ozdra9jhhzqlndlrc9os.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>     The tale is about a girl named Kara Grey, who is pulled into a war hidden from people in 1990's New Hampshire between fairies and monsters. She is turned into a weapon as she falls down the proverbial rabbit hole into very dark places. By this issue, she is serving a monster known only as Simon as they terminate the creatures on his hit list. </p>

<p>     The book is already complete! This is your opportunity to get into this tale, or continue the journey you're already on! Either way, I hope you enjoy what you find here.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>As I stated before. This book is complete! I am only looking to acquire the expenses for printing. </li>
<li>I am offering a few different perks including digital or physical copies of all the Autumn Grey books. All books will be signed by me. There is also going to be a special variant cover only available through this campaign! </li>
<li>Any funds raised by this campaign will go directly to printing costs. The better this campaign does, the nicer options for printing we will have. </li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>The indie market in comics is booming! There is unlimited potential stretching in every direction with more variety than you can imagine.

<li>This is the first time I'm using crowd funding for an issue of Autumn Grey. Usually I preorder through my site and make most of my sales through comic conventions. But the way the world is at this time, I needed to find other ways of promoting growth. </li>
<li>So every dollar I make here will solely go to the printing and distribution of the comic, Autumn Grey. I hope this campaign brings Autumn Grey to more places than I ever could by traveling to comic shows. </li>

<p>I begin drawing in sixth grade when I realized school was boring and I needed something to distract myself from it. Soon, I realized other people enjoyed seeing my work as much as I enjoyed making it. Sometime in high school I begin making comics. And eventually I got a real drawing tablet (pictured above). And it served me well for 8+ years making every comic and digital art piece that you've seen. But sadly, it is dying. I've worked it to death and it is slowly getting harder and harder to work with. So I need a new one, and I figured this is an excellent time for some of you to get some cool stuff while we're at it.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Stuff for Stuff</h3> <p>If I'm to continue making comics, I'm going to need some help. I've got some money but with the wonderful financial obligations of being a college student, I don't have enough to buy what I need. And this is where you come in.</p> <ul><li>I'm looking for 500 bucks. That's it. I'm aiming for the Large Wacom Intuos5 but if by some miracle we raise more money, I'll spring for a tablet with a screen. All of this in the name of bringing you more free webcomics for your enjoyment.</li></ul>You're probably wondering: Dave! What do I get if I help you get a tablet (besides more comics)? Well that's a good question, person. You see, depending on how much you donate, you can get stuff. That's right stuff. Specifically this stuff:</div><div>
<ul>
<li>$1: Eternal Gratitude</li>
<li>$5: A full-res digital file of any comic strip/page from any comic I've made. Your choice.</li>
<li>$10: A scan of a pencil sketch of any two characters you want. Doing whatever you want (with the exception of overly graphic or risqué content) (no backgrounds)</li>
<li>$15: A scan of a pencil sketch any three characters you want. Doing whatever you want (with the exception of overly graphic or risqué content) (no backgrounds)</li>
<li>$25: A digital drawing of any two characters you want Doing whatever you want (with the exception of overly graphic or risqué content) (no backgrounds)</li>
<li>$50: A digital drawing of up to four characters you want. Doing whatever you want. (with the exception of overly graphic or risqué content) (NO background)</li>
<li>$60: A digital drawing of up to four characters you want. Doing whatever you want. (with the exception of overly graphic or risqué content) (background included!)</li>
<li>$100: An actual pencil drawing (up to 3 characters doing whatever you want with the exception of overly graphic or risqué content) mailed to you. Signed and stuff by the creators of the characters that you choose.</li>
</ul>
<div>EVERY perk above $5 will include the digital file of a comic strip/page of your choice</div>
<div>NOTE: I reserve the right to draw what I think is appropriate. If you request a drawing I'm not comfortable with, I will contact you about it. I will do my best to draw what you want. I will get as close to what you are thinking as I can. The more description of what you want the better chance of getting the drawing the way you want it.</div>
</div><div>
<br/>You might also be wondering: Dave! What if you don't reach your goal? Any money earned will be going towards the tablet. Additional money will go towards bettering the comics. Always.<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>What? This has an impact? Well it will help me continue to bring great free content to you folks. Everyone loves free stuff right? </p>
</div><div><ul></ul></div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you can't contribute, please consider at least sharing my comics with people you know. Because that's what this is really about. Having something cool, or funny, or awesome to share with your friends. Any support will help me share my stories with you and the rest of the internet. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>If We Succeed</h3>
<p>If everyone works out you all will have helped ensure I can continue to work on the comics. And if we manage to raise more money I'll be able to go for even better tablets to make the comics the best they can be.</p>
<p>Depending on how things go, bonus stuff might appear. Who knows?</p>

Stan Lee, Steve Ditko, and Jack Kirby don't create comics anymore.  Or do they?
Can we channel the spirits of the greats?
Get back to that love of comics you had!  When and heroes fought off great odds to rescue the helpless and mad scientists created formula x!
SunJay is a young man who lived in another dimension and escaped from a totalitarian world to America.  He's so thrilled at the many different ways he can run his own life, he decides to pay back the great kindness of being allowed to stay:  By becoming a hero.
In this first issue ever, SunJay is challenged by Sarna.   In their world, Sarna had been a demolition expert, hired to destroy the past.  Now in America, not satisfied with being free, she longs for the perks of her old life.  And she's willing to blow things up to get them.
Armed with his strength and good looks and the values of his father, SunJay could get her what she wants-- ""everything""-- or stop her!

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>FAQ</h3>
<div><b>1. Where do I add shipping?</b></div> <p>There isn't a place for indiegogo to add shipping after the fact so we have added it to all perks. So that shipping charge is included in everything.</p>
<p><b>2. What made you decide to partner up with Dani Divine?</b></p>
<p>Basically we had this great script ready but something was missing. The main character was already a bad ass, sexy, hard as nails woman so we looked around for who represented those characteristics. Naturally, our first choice was Dani Divine and the rest is history.</p>
<p><b>3. How do the character perks work?</b></p>
<p>Simple. Once you order this perk you will be contacted by someone on the art team for Hard Exit. You will be asked to send 2-3 pictures for us to create your character that will appear in the comic. Just by looking at our main character you can see how good we are at making this happen.</p>
<p><b>4. What about these indie movie rumours?</b></p>
<p>Yes, we have been contacted about taking this from comic form to movie but creating an eye catching, hard hitting comic series is our first priority. To do that we need your help. Without your support none of this is possible.</p>
<p><b>5. Is Dani Divine really going to be at the signing party perk? Where is it going to be held and isn't she based in the UK?</b></p>
<p>Absolutely! She is working out as we speak to get her hands and arms in top strength to sign everyones copy that comes to the signing party. The party will be held in the city that has the most backers. Dani will fly in and everyone will have a fantastic day getting autographs and taking pictures.</p>
<p><b>6. I would love to help but you know...the economy and all.</b></p>
<p>Understood! It would be great if you can share this project with all your friends and family, especially on social media. Indiegogo offers a lot of ways to share projects so look for the tabs they provide and help spread the word. It's appreciated.</p>
<p>Any questions can also be sent to info@atomicinkcomix.com and we will do our best to answer them quickly.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hey! I'm Twixx Johnson an amateur comedienne from Asbury Park, NJ. In March I will be celebrating my one yr comedy anniversary and I am still trying to learn and grow, network and get to work with various people. I was introduced to the FICA or Females In Comedy Association through a dear friend and also to the fact that they are having their First Annual Female Comedy convention. A place that is perfect for me to get the experience and support of comediennes such as myself. Ms. Hope Flood A 23 yr vet started the association to give people the opputunity and i feel that i deserve to be there but being a single mom on a fixed income, well its kinda hard to take financial leaps as great as this because my responsibilities definitely come first.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact will be great on my family, friends, supporters, and my community as a whole because i get to come out and represent for us and they get to see that I am very serious about making positive examples to our children that you can be what you want to be with God, determination and hardwork. It will be an impact on me because it will prove my point that there are ppl who still care enough to support a person who has a dream and it shows that am loved and also blessed.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What we need it the funds to pay for the transportation, the room/board, the convention, the performer's fee and the professional attire. Its strictly for the trip not for a vacation even though i plan to enjoy every experience this trip has to offer.

The comic book industry has spent almost the entire past century writing super hero comics. Now, consumers are demanding new material, and we have three stories that we want to tell that we think you'll all enjoy.<br/><br/>The first one is called <i>Travelers Passed</i>, and it's the story of how Detective Prospero Leatherby finds out he can warp reality and then spends about four years trying to get back to our version of reality once he's banished from it for breaking the rules. Also notable is his partner, Lieutenant Richard Hall, who solves murders with Prospero.<br/><br/>On what might seem like a lighter tone, we have a series called <i>Orenda</i>. It's a retelling of fairy tales, folk tales, and classical literature from across the world, but it is definitely not for kids. <i>Orenda</i> follows an expansive cast of characters, but for the first stretch of the comic it mostly follows two unlikely friends: Tsarevitch Ivan of <i>Tsarevitch Ivan, the Fire Bird and the Grey Wolf</i> and Rapunzel, of... <i>Rapunzel</i>... The two seem to get into quite a bit of trouble together, but unlike many fairy tales, their villains' actions can't always be fixed at the end.<br/><br/>Finally, we're working on a limited eight part miniseries with fourty eight pages a piece called <i>The Final Stretch</i>. The idea is that Order and Chaos have fought with humans since the beginning of time. Our history has been shaped by their battles, called turning points. When we jump in there are five turning points left and both sides are tied.

Now, consumers are demanding new material, and we have three stories that we want to tell that we think you'll all enjoy.The first one is called Travelers Passed, and it's the story of how Detective Prospero Leatherby finds out he can warp reality and then spends about four years trying to get back to our version of reality once he's banished from it for breaking the rules. Also notable is his partner, Lieutenant Richard Hall, who solves murders with Prospero.On what might seem like a lighter tone, we have a series called Orenda. It's a retelling of fairy tales, folk tales, and classical literature from across the world, but it is definitely not for kids. Orenda follows an expansive cast of characters, but for the first stretch of the comic it mostly follows two unlikely friends: Tsarevitch Ivan of Tsarevitch Ivan, the Fire Bird and the Grey Wolf and Rapunzel, of... Rapunzel... The two seem to get into quite a bit of trouble together, but unlike many fairy tales, their villains' actions can't always be fixed at the end.Finally, we're working on a limited eight part miniseries with fourty eight pages a piece called The Final Stretch. The idea is that Order and Chaos have fought with humans since the beginning of time. Our history has been shaped by their battles, called turning points. When we jump in there are five turning points left and both sides are tied. We watch as two young Irish boys, best friends to this point, are made key players for each side.What We Need & What You GetSo our Studio is a production studio, not a publisher, which means our startup costs are pretty cheap. What do we need to start up?
We have to pay all of our business licensing fees. You know, so that we can do business with publishers and have some protection besides one person saying that they'll take care of it.
A website. While we're currently working off of a Tumblr, that's ultimately not going to cut it. We've got to have a place for people to see what we do.
Artists. While most of our artists work off of a royalty program, there are a few that are being used and/or considered as guest artists who will only work for page rates. So besides paying them, we want to be sure that over the four to eight month gap between submitting and getting out books out to the public our artists have some cash.
So those are the three things that we're focused on with this project.You guys can look to the perks to see what you'll get in investing in us at each level, but some of our favorites being offered are a special edition Acrine Preview, which will include not only preview of all three series but concept art, and a special video conference where you'll get to ask us questions and we'll answer them.The ImpactWe can make comics as much as we want, and even if we have to do it on no budget we'll keep making them, because that's what we love to do.

<h3>Allô !</h3>
<p>Bienvenue à ma campagne Indiegogo !</p>
<p>Je suis Rosz, je suis actuellement finissante à l'Université du Québec en Outaouais, dans le Baccalauréat en Arts et design, concentration bande dessinée. À la fin de leur parcours universitaire, les étudiants finissants doivent réaliser un projet de fin d'études qui représente tout leurs apprentissages et leur évolution au sein de l'Université. Et je n'y échappe pas !</p>
<p>L'impression des projets &lt;&lt;synthèse&gt;&gt; est très important pour les étudiants finissants en bande dessinée, car ils représentent non seulement la fin de leurs études , mais il est souvent vendu à l'Exposition des finissants de l'ÉMI, dans divers festivals de bande dessinée, et il est aussi représenté en guise de portfolio pour les maisons d'éditions. </p>
<p>Ainsi, je vous demande de l'aide pour m'aider à imprimer mon projet, en échange de votre don.  Si le montant est d'au moins 15$, vous aurez droit à une copie du livre!</p>
<p>L'intimidation est un sujet très important pour moi, et c'est pour cette raison que j'en ai fait le sujet de mon projet de fin d'études. Ayant été victime moi-même d'intimidation, je me suis basée non seulement sur les choses que j'ai vécues, mais ce que j'ai aussi entendu de mes pairs. Le secondaire a été une partie très noire de ma vie, où je me sentais perdue, et abandonnée. Je souhaiterais que <i>Crinolines </i>apporte de l'espoir à son lecteur, que s'il a une passion, un.e ami.e, qui lui est cher.ère, que tout ira bien et pour le mieux. </p>
<p>Sur ce, si vous avez envie de m'encourager moi, ou le projet <i>Crinolines</i>, je serais éternellement reconnaissante de vos dons, peut importe de sa valeur ! Non seulement vous contribuer à l'impression de ce projet, mais également au début de la carrière de mes rêves; auteure de bande dessinée.</p>

individual in matters related to educating our youth on environmental issues.       Earth Team Green's overarching goal is to introduce our <b>Environmental Edutainment System</b> titled,“The Art and Science of Getting Green,”that includes our signature Eco-Thriller Comic Book series aptly titled “<b>Earth Team Green,” </b> to 5th Grade Students across America. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Today we're seeking funds to assist with the costs of employing a new lead comic book artist and printing sufficient copies of Earth Team Green's Issue 8 for distribution to 5th Graders at Cedarwood Alternative Elementary School, located in Columbus, Ohio. Cedarwood Alternative Elementary School will be the sixth school district we've introduced our ""Eco-Thriller Comic Books In The Classroom"" initiative. Here's where we've been: Elgin, Illinois, Century Oaks Elementary School, Reynoldsburg, Ohio, Hannah Ashton Middle School, Mansfield, Ohio, Malabar and Hedges Middle Schools, Brilliant, Ohio, Buckeye North Elementary School. Working with the ""Next Generation"" (5th Graders) is near and dear to my heart. They are the future and we need to show them how to protect and respect the environment. </p>
<p>Earth Team Green's slogan is, ""<b>We Touch The Future</b>"" which simply means we help our youth understand the importance of caring for our planet today to ensure our  natural resources and needs of future generations will be sustained.</p>
