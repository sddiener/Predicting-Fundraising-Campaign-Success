<p>Hello,</p>
<p>My name is Dephillia McClenon, inventor of the
Pro-Protector Toothbrush Holder. I am the mother of three girls. I worked for
the US Postal Service close to twenty -five years before trying my hand at
business.</p>
<p>We were attending a conference, staying in a
major hotel with our only toothbrush storage options were, place
toothbrush in bathroom cup or place toothbrush in drawer. So, we purchased
economy holders at one of the major drug chains. The next morning our
toothbrushes were still damp from not being able to dry.<br/>
The Pro-Protector was created out of a need for a toothbrush holder that
protects the entire toothbrush from airborne germs and bacteria floating in the
air from flushing the toilet. </p>
<p>Through years of hard
work, enduring very difficult times and making family sacrifices  for
the last ten years, I finally have a product that serves a need, one of which
most of us encounter, protecting of toothbrush from airborne germs and
bacteria. Your contribution to my campaign will be highly appreciated.  I asking
for your help is supporting my campaign and making it a success.</p>

There will also be an increased amount of competitors offering similar products. However, our goal is that by then, repellX would be the obvious choice for the consumer as our product is the only one that is extremely effective as well as ecofriendly.
We will always be at the cutting edge when it comes to research and advancements in technology and therefore we think we will always be able to offer the best products to our customers, before any competitors do.

My name is Terry Cox and I'm the Inventor of the Save our Swimmers alert system. When I was a child, I lost TWO of my closest friends to drowning. I never got over it. Later in life, I discovered that drowning 
is the NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF DEATH in children
under 4, and second only to car accidents in killing children and adults under 25. A majority of those who drown are in the company or care of responsible adults.
I also learned that DROWNING IS ALMOST ALWAYS PREVENTABLE. The main reason people are so vulnerable is that most of us are unaware of what drowning really looks like. 

*   Drowning
doesn’t make a splash.  People who are drowning look very much like
they’re just treading water. They don’t stand out among other swimmers. 
*   Drowning
is silent.  Because the throat closes up to prevent water from entering the
windpipe, those drowning are unable to call out for help. Most people don't know this, and it is exactly why so many swimmers drown within feet of other swimmers!
*   Drowning
is fast. It takes as little as 60 seconds in adults and as little as 20
seconds in children.  
* NOTHING CAN OR SHOULD REPLACE PARENTAL VIGILANCE. 
Just like seatbelts help save lives in cars and helmets help save lives on bikes, the SOS device can help save lives in the water.
Please help us to bring this product to market, so we can make the water the fun and the safe place we all know it can be!
How it Works


The SOS Alert System can be worn on a headband by an experienced
swimmer and set to go off after a dangerous period of submersion or worn on a
wristband by a non-swimmer, going off immediately upon contact with water. The product also features a “panic button,”
which a swimmer can push at any sign of danger to themselves or others in the
water.
Currently in prototype form, the device electronically
communicates with a pager-like receiver. We're now working with developers to
create a smartphone application for the SOS – a goal we anticipate achieving
in the coming weeks. 
Our unique product has a patent pending.
   What We Need & What You Get We need 100,000.00 to evolve our current rough prototype into a more streamlined & designed prototype that works with an external receiver and is also compatible with iPhone and Android technology. This amount will also allow us a significant opportunity to test-market the product and raise awareness, making it possible to then mass produce. 
If we go beyond our current goal, the additional funds will allow us to make any changes the new prototype proves necessary or advantageous. 
Should we significantly surpass our goal, we will move to the manufacturing phase. 
    The Impact 1.2 MILLION people die worldwide annually from drowning. THAT'S 2 PEOPLE PER SECOND! Most of these deaths are entirely preventable.
Our product and even the campaign itself will raise awareness about recognizing the signs of drowning. This knowledge and the release of the product can realistically prevent unnecessary deaths in children and adults.
We've spent all of our own money to get where we are -- with a rough working prototype and a PATENT PENDING. Now we need you on the team to get the SOS Device out to the world!
    Risks & Challenges Our biggest challenge at this point is getting the funds to get the product to market -- an undertaking that costs literally hundreds of thousands of dollars. This is why we need your help. We see a very dire need here with nothing less at stake than the lives of children. Hundreds of thousands of dollars MUST NOT stand in the way of saving hundreds of thousands of lives!
    Other Ways You Can Help We know that financial contributions are not possible for everyone. You can still help. Please spread the word about our campaign through social media and good old-fashioned word of mouth. Indiegogo has some great share tools (just a click away). While the SOS device is a powerful tool, AWARENESS is the most important tool and you can build that with your choice to get involved!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p><p><b>Hello!</b><br/>
<br/>
We are Michael Farraj and Alejandra Picazo founders and inventors of Tidy Nails, the first and only swab for cleaning underneath finger and toenails.  <span>Our campaign is important to us for a couple of reasons, we believe this unique
product will improve the world by introducing a specialized device to clean and
protect under nails.  There are many statistics of germs that collect
underneath the fingernails such as fungus, bacteria, viruses and just plain
unsightly dirt and oil.  The only thing we have to date which supposedly
cleans underneath the fingernail is either a piece of wood, metal, or plastic that scrapes dirt while stripping the protective coating allowing dirt and oil
to collect underneath the nail faster than before.  Our product cleans and
disinfects with a natural solution, plus helps rebuild the nail with amino
acids.  How many times have you looked down at your nails and said to
yourself ""There has got to be a better way""?<br/>
<br/>
By helping fund this project, you can be a part of history in the making! 
We believe this device will pioneer and change how the world beautifies and
disinfects their finger/toenails.  We tried to fund this project
ourselves, but the way the USPTO is set up, one must continuously submit applications (paying fees every time) while waiting months to years for a
response.  Most of the time this leads to
another submission and delaying the process of having your patent properly
apply to your invention.  This alone has hindered our ability to bring this extremely useful invention to You!  Needless to say, after 5 years of going back and
forth with the patent office, we now have a patent!  The downside to our battle with the patent office is we have used up all of our investment money and
we do not have what we need to move forward with a prototype, manufacturing, packaging, marketing, consulting
etc...<br/>
<br/>
<b>What we need:</b><br/>
<br/>
Currently, we need contributions in upwards of $500,000.00 to launch this
product correctly.  The funds will go to properly launching the company.<br/>
<br/>

<p>As for funding to produce the necessary moulds in order to

files and cut the molds. This would then permit me to employ the services of plastic
injection facility to output the PolyCarbonate pieces. The aluminum requires 3
moulds for extrusion. However, these are far less expensive. It is my belief
that I can purchase the bristle and hire a third party facility to actually
doing the bristling aspect of the brush. We plan to look at using the services
of a third party service for the physically and mentally challenged to perform
the assembly. This will be a step by step process and I believe would be well

<div>I opened the Ranch in the summer of 2014 to address the growing need for land-based treatment options for rural folks suffering from addiction and mental health problems. My years in the federal health sector as an addiction counsellor, program developer and residential treatment director (and my driving passion for this work) allowed me to honestly look at our programs and see how we were failing many of our most vulnerable people. </div>
<div>For many years the grass roots and front-lines  have advocated to develop land-based, culturally grounded treatment programs, family treatment programs, and facilities that did not, by design, discriminate based on sexual orientation or identity. I and passionate others worked diligently to move these recommendations forward within the system to no avail.</div>
<div>I began to bring my residential clients out to my home ranch for day trips - just a chance to get out of the institutional setting, stop watching the clock and be in a space big enough to contain their pain and grief. I watched the masks they wore to protect themselves fall away in this environment - they connected deeply with the land, the wildlife and especially with the horses. These were healing days, my favorite days...and I knew if I ever had the chance, I'd make every day look and feel like that.</div>
<div>I left the federal health sector in 2013 and pursued my vision of developing a truly integrated land-based program. With my background in addictions and psychology, newly aquired EAPD training and lots of support from Higher Trails and it's alumni, a solid business plan, 160 acres and all the courage I could muster, I launched the program and haven't looked back since!</div>

<p>Introducing Amni-Nik®, a medical device which safely and easily ruptures the amniotic sac during childbirth! We at BirthTec have developed a technology to make amniotomy easier, safer and more comfortable. Currently, other devices used for amniotomy (the procedure of artificially rupturing the amniotic sac) all have an exposed sharp which can injure mother and/or baby. Thanks to Amni-Nik®'s unique design features, it works quickly and easily with no risk of injury to mother or baby. The specially<span> engineered sharp is curved and hollow, designed to overcome the surface tension and the double layer of the amniotic sac. The sharp is surrounded by prongs that both protect the fetal head and depress the wall of the sac towards the sharp. It is easy and intuitive to use - just gentle forward pressure, you'll get it on your first try! </span>A few dedicated investors and practitioners have funded the initial R &amp; D for the Amni-Nik® - the first generation (in stainless steel) is currently in use and providers love its efficacy and ease of use.

<p><b></b></p>
<h3>What We Need and What You Get</h3>
<p>We need you to buy it! Pre-sales will help fund the making of a mold for plastic-injection manufacturing and a first run of Amni-Nik®, the safer, easier to use device that will become the standard of care for the common procedure of rupturing the amniotic sac.</p>
<p>For MDs, midwives, hospitals and birth centers this is your chance to be early adopters! This way you and your patients know you use the most up-to-date technology for safe, reliable care. Amni-Nik® is appropriate for use in any setting where amniotomy is performed, by any provider who would typically perform the procedure. </p>
<p>For everyone else, you get one of our great branded give aways that show the world you care about making maternity care as good as it can be. In our journey to develop and market this device, we've heard countless stories from women who experienced a painful or harmful amniotomy and understand the value of this gentle technology. Add your voice to the message that women and babies deserve better! Choose from postcard, tote bag, or cap. You can also GIVE Amni-Nik® to a low-resource clinic. </p>
<p>We at BirthTec care deeply about making birth safer, about improving the patient experience, and about improved health outcomes. Support our campaign and show that you too care about the large and small details of making birth better.  Every contributor makes a difference!<br/></p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Teach someone else about the company</b></p>
<p>At
its core, this campaign is about helping people who love sports like we do. If
you're in a position to teach someone else how to support this team - do it!
You are contributing to this campaign by passing on the awareness of this company’s
mission. FanOne Sports is your team!</p>
<p><b>Spread the word</b></p>
<p>You
can contribute your popularity by telling your friends and family about this campaign.
The success of this campaign is directly correlated with the number of people
who view this page. If you can increase that number, you are making a tangible
contribution to the mission!</p>
<p><b>How We'll Use the Funds</b></p>
<p>Approximately <b>$100,000</b> will be needed to break FanOne Sports into the sports
apparel market. That will include licensing, marketing, manufacturing, distribution and
business <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">related expenses. This initial
investment will allow us to enter into the Collegiate market first. If our
campaign raises more capital than our initial goal amount, we will use those funds to
obtain licenses from each of the professional licensing organizations located
within the United States &amp; Canada: NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL, UFC, MLS, CFL, WWE
and Walt Disney. Each of these companies have their own unique price structures for licensing. Some of these can go well into 6 figures or more.</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>The most notable risk is production delays. Any delay in production will lead to delivery delays to our customers. We actually believe our orders will be delivered to our supporters much earlier.</div>

Teach someone else about the company
At
its core, this campaign is about helping people who love sports like we do. If
you're in a position to teach someone else how to support this team - do it!
You are contributing to this campaign by passing on the awareness of this company’s
mission. FanOne Sports is your team!
Spread the word
You
can contribute your popularity by telling your friends and family about this campaign.
The success of this campaign is directly correlated with the number of people
who view this page. If you can increase that number, you are making a tangible
contribution to the mission!
How We'll Use the Funds
Approximately $100,000 will be needed to break FanOne Sports into the sports
apparel market. That will include licensing, marketing, manufacturing, distribution and
business related expenses. This initial
investment will allow us to enter into the Collegiate market first. If our
campaign raises more capital than our initial goal amount, we will use those funds to
obtain licenses from each of the professional licensing organizations located
within the United States & Canada: NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL, UFC, MLS, CFL, WWE
and Walt Disney. Each of these companies have their own unique price structures for licensing. Some of these can go well into 6 figures or more.

Risks & ChallengesThe most notable risk is production delays. Any delay in production will lead to delivery delays to our customers. We actually believe our orders will be delivered to our supporters much earlier.








     






We feel so grateful to everyone who has
taken the time to read our campaign and for those who contributed what they
could to make a difference and helping us spread the word.  We have spent the last few months working
hard to bring our vision to life in this campaign and it was worth every minute
thanks to all our generous supporters.

debit cards.
Please
help spread the word!
This has proven to be one of the
hardest things I have ever done.  I don't
have a million friends to share this with.

<h2>FAQ’s</h2>
<h4><i>So what are the disks made of again?</i></h4>
<p>The disks are made of tourmaline stone. The stones are seen in many colours and when transparent, are considered as semi-precious gemstones. They have been used by many cultures for their healing qualities for centuries. The tourmaline used to make the disks has an added quality of having been treated with nanotechnology.  Certain beneficial qualities not available before have been brought out through the treatment process, and our disks carry these beneficial qualities. </p>
<p><i style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 24px; background-color: initial;"">Is there a best time to apply the disks?</i></p>
<p>No!  The disks can be applied any time of day, and in almost any situation, depending what you are wanting to treat.  For instance, if you are experiencing greater than usual stress levels, it may be the perfect time to use the disks with the stress-relief prescription.</p>
<p><i><b>How long do I leave them on my body for?</b></i></p>
<p>You can leave the disks on your body for up to 40 minutes, depending on how sensitive you are.  Even if you start with only a few minutes and continue using them while increasing the time with each application, you'll learn to know when their job is done and they can be removed.</p>
<p><i><b>Do I need to rest afterwards?</b></i></p>
<p>This is really up to you.  It is recommended that you take a moment after removing the disks to experience the gentle changes that are happening within you. The healing continues on subtle levels as more and more harmony and peace spreads throughout your being. However, if you have no time for reflection, just carry on your day with the awareness of how the disks are helping you.</p>
<p><b><i>How long do the disks last?</i></b></p>
<p>There really is no life limit on the disks.  With proper use and care, they should last you indefinitely.  Their healing powers do not run out!

</p>
<p><b><i>Can I order more disks if I want?</i></b></p>
<p>Yes!  We would be happy to ship more disks, as there are a few prescriptions, such as the Anti-Ageing Treatment that can use up to 20 disks.</p>
<p><b><i>Can I use the same disks for multiple people?</i></b></p>
<p>Of course.  Just wipe the disks with a damp tissue after each use, as per the instructional guide, and they are ready to use again for anyone.  Ee like to think of the kit as a family investment, as well as an individual one.</p>
<p><b><i>Is this the same as Hot Stone Therapy?</i></b></p>
<p>No.  Our therapy are not hot stone therapy. When the healing disks are on, some of the points may feel hot, but this is your body's reaction as the energy and neural blocks begin to dissolve. </p>

Proven Effectiveness


The Healing Disks are made of Tourmaline stone and treated with Nanotechnology, which can affect materials on an exceedingly small scale. This technology is used in medicine to provide better healing effects than were previously possible. Our disks are one example.
So how do the Healing Disks Work?Placed on the chosen body points, the 1.3"" wide disks interact with the body's energy (Chi) channels creating a resonance that gently dissolves existing energy blocks. Open pathways enable the fluid intelligence of the Source Energy (WuChi), present in all creation, to act on and harmonize the brain, nerves, blood, muscles, organs, even bone marrow.  Use of the disks restores order on the body's cellular physiology, and consequently rebalances the whole body bringing well-being.

(back of the neck and top of the wrists) has
effectively removed any tension-related headaches
and symptoms. I also sleep better, and am generally
more relaxed.” Becky S.

“I experienced painful sciatica caused by a
herniated disk. The healing disks eased the pain
before and after the operation – with no need for pain
medication. Now I use the disks to overcome stress,
to improve my immune system and for rejuvenation.
I am so thankful!” Elizabeth L. 



Why We Need YouOur initial funding is to cover our costs so far; guidebooks, packaging, material and expertise, and in the production of 40 kits for the new year.  At this point, 60 guidebooks have been printed and are ready to go, and we have enough disks to make 40 kits.  The next stage is to expand our business, and we will of course need to purchase more supplies.  We also need to finance our packaging in order to sell the kit in a safe and presentable way.  Then, in order to reach out to potential customers, we need funds for local and online promotion, including brochures, and website design, building, and hosting. We need your help to make our plan a market reality!
Further Funding
With your help, we can achieve and pass our initial goal of $30,000, and then expand our reach to businesses such as health food and supply stores as well as to health care professionals, who can use the disks to improve the health of their clients. This way more and more people can benefit from our simple yet reliable Health Preservation and Healing system.
Our further, and most important outreach is to third world countries, which have the greatest needs for reasonable alternatives such as our simple-to-use Healing Disks. They could become part of a realizable health solution for all human beings.
Our Vision
To expand and reach a global market with a goal of helping as many people as possible Be-In-Charge of their own health by using Holistic Healing Disks regularly. Through this we can achieve balance and well-being in every aspect of life. This clarifies and nurtures us physically, emotionally and spiritually.  We can regain our innate vitality while radiating harmony and joy to those around us.
Timeline



FAQ’s
So what are the disks made of again?
The disks are made of tourmaline stone. The stones are seen in many colours and when transparent, are considered as semi-precious gemstones. They have been used by many cultures for their healing qualities for centuries. The tourmaline used to make the disks has an added quality of having been treated with nanotechnology.  Certain beneficial qualities not available before have been brought out through the treatment process, and our disks carry these beneficial qualities. 
Is there a best time to apply the disks?
No!  The disks can be applied any time of day, and in almost any situation, depending what you are wanting to treat.  For instance, if you are experiencing greater than usual stress levels, it may be the perfect time to use the disks with the stress-relief prescription.
How long do I leave them on my body for?
You can leave the disks on your body for up to 40 minutes, depending on how sensitive you are.  Even if you start with only a few minutes and continue using them while increasing the time with each application, you'll learn to know when their job is done and they can be removed.
Do I need to rest afterwards?
This is really up to you.  It is recommended that you take a moment after removing the disks to experience the gentle changes that are happening within you. The healing continues on subtle levels as more and more harmony and peace spreads throughout your being. However, if you have no time for reflection, just carry on your day with the awareness of how the disks are helping you.
How long do the disks last?
There really is no life limit on the disks.  With proper use and care, they should last you indefinitely.  Their healing powers do not run out!


Can I order more disks if I want?
Yes!  We would be happy to ship more disks, as there are a few prescriptions, such as the Anti-Ageing Treatment that can use up to 20 disks.
Can I use the same disks for multiple people?
Of course.  Just wipe the disks with a damp tissue after each use, as per the instructional guide, and they are ready to use again for anyone.  Ee like to think of the kit as a family investment, as well as an individual one.
Is this the same as Hot Stone Therapy?
No.  Our therapy are not hot stone therapy. When the healing disks are on, some of the points may feel hot, but this is your body's reaction as the energy and neural blocks begin to dissolve. 

A last wordIf you share our dream of bringing healing to as many people as possible, or would just like to own your own Needle-less Acupuncture kit, then please help us by donating. Please help us bring healing far and wide, even if it is just spreading the word about our idea. . .  We appreciate anything you can do to help us, because we can only do so much!

The Team

Anna Carling
Anna is the pioneer behind our business’s idea.  Having been a professional acupuncturist for over 25 years, Anna has seen how the Nanotech Disks have changed acupuncture in her practice since they came into the field about ten years ago.  Her dream has always been to bring healing to as many people as possible, and now, with these disks, she feels that that is more possible than ever.



Carl Natiuk
Carl is the other half of the team.  He is in charge of the technical and social-media aspects of our campaign, and much of the other ‘behind-the-scenes’ work.  Having recently graduated rom High School, Carl is fresh with new ideas, while at the same time is able to offer insight into the deeper levels of the business.  With a natural talent for layout and design, he is learning how to best reach our customers in the fast-changing culture of business/customer relationships. 


Medicine Tao
Medicine Tao is the name of our business.  Currently, we sell only the Acupuncture kit, but in the future, we hope to expand and carry other products of a similar nature to the kit, perhaps complimenting it, or offering another approach, but always looking along the idea of healing oneself.




See the signs and know the times, 
Let the long night end,
Let the new day dawn.
May the heart be quiet and calm,
The New Day is coming on.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

Providing a significant ""Athlete's Edge"" for users, they offer a highly effective, non-drug therapy that will enhance performance in athletes and should become part of their regular training and exercise regimens.The tights are proven to accelerate muscle recovery and the healing of cellular function and blood vessels, and to promote overall soft tissue recovery from strenuous athletic training and competition.FDA/GMP and ISO13483/2003 Certified, the WearTech Tights are tested, proven and ready to go into large scale production with a boost from our Indiegogo supporters. That's why, for a limited time only and for a limited quantity, we are offering rewards representing deep discounts on the tights, our proprietary DC stimulators and more, most at 40-50% off as presented on the right.GET YOURS NOW!While designed and tested with the professional and other serious athletes in mind, the unique WearTech Tights will benefit anyone with an active lifestyle, anyone with sore muscles or circulation issues. The tights provide a convenient, comfortable, easy but highly effective therapy, pain relief and muscle recovery without the need for any large equipment, wires or a therapist. Just put them on and turn them on, then relax. There is nothing else on the market today that compares.The fundamental dynamic of WearTech Therapeutics' products is continuous, variable, DC electrotherapeutic energy that is applied to the exterior surface of the body, such as the legs, but which penetrates deep into the muscle tissue promoting rapid soft tissue healing.Sport-Z DC StimulatorThe continuous energy application is achieved through WearTech's proprietary electrical stimulator, the Sport-Z™.  It generates the DC energy that is conducted through WearTech's proprietary ""Intelligent Textiles For Medicine®"" silver mesh fabric.The result is increased microcirculation to the designated body regions for better pain management, relief of muscle spasms, and  reduction of disuse atrophy (muscle wasting), edema (swelling) and inflammation, all of which contribute to more rapid soft tissue recoveryand enhanced endurance.Unlike the TENS units whose AC current only stays near the surface of the skin, the WearTech Tights' small Sport-Z stimulator applies pulsed direct current (DC) deep into the soft tissue, stimulating micro-circulation and reducing inflammation down where the TENS units cannot reach, thereby speeding up the muscle recovery process throughout the legs and providing real pain relief. WearTech has already developed, clinically proven and holds two copyrights for its proprietary software for the Sport-Z's DC electrotherapeutic energy technology and its delivery through the tights while sleeping with optional, pre-programmed, eight cycles of deep, pulsed therapy.The Conductive FabricThe tights are made of WearTech's highly conductive Electro-Mesh Silver Yards (EMSY) which conducts the deep-penetrating DC current throughout the legs. This fabric can be made into numerous configurations including various panels and wraps. EMSY is time-tested with a sixteen-year safety database and laboratory studies proving its biocompatibility and lack of cytotoxicity. The fabric's high effectiveness is proven with 20 published clinical studies and treatment of more than 300,000 patients. EMSY is in compliance with the FDA/GMP as well as CE-Certification under The Medical Device Directive of the EU ISO13485/2003. Therapy While SleepingOne of the WearTech Tights' unique features is the simple wireless therapy delivery at home or on the road while at rest.Therapy while sleeping is highly effective because: 
The human body’s biological healing cycle is more regenerative and pronounced at night, where 70% of growth hormones are produced along with Venous Endothelia Growth Factor, VEGF.
Pain, which is often more pronounced at night, is relieved, allowing for better sleep.
There's no better ease-of-use than getting 8 treatments while asleep.

<br/><p>Stevia del Condado nace en el año 2013 como un proyecto de investigación en la localidad de Navas de San Juan, Jaén. Jaén está situada en la Comunidad Autónoma de Andalucía, España.</p>
<p>Tras distintos estudios de mercado y otros estudios empíricos sobre analítica de suelo, los resultados arrojaban una propensión positiva a producción y rentabilidad. Somos una empresa dedicada a la comercialización de Stevia y derivados, como plantas aromáticas y tés con Stevia. Para todo ello se utilizan productos naturales, ecológicos y en algunos casos silvestres. Asimismo, el principal producto, la Stevia de cultivo propio y producido en régimen ecológico, tiene unas propiedades medicinales difícilmente comparables a cualquier otra Stevia, no solo como edulcorante natural.</p>
<p>Manuel Justiniano es el ingeniero encargado de la producción de Stevia. La labor más compleja reside en la selección de las semillas que van a integrar los cultivos de esta planta. Dicha selección se obtiene de parámetros comprendidos entre la experiencia, los estudios realizados con anteriores y por último, apoyándose en técnicas naturales como la polinización con abejas.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p></p>
<p>Necesitamos, al menos, 35000 euros para poder mejorar la
cadena de producción. Queremos ser más eficientes y desarrollar acciones para
ser mas respetuosos con el medio ambiente.</p>
<p>Desarrollaremos maquinaria específica que sea limpia,
innovadora y útil. Hasta hoy hemos recibido muchos premios por nuestra gestión,
y queremos seguir al alza.</p>
<p>En caso de no conseguir la meta, usaremos el dinero para el
mismo asunto, aunque no podamos desarrollar al completo, iniciaremos su
desarrollo y completarlo lo antes posible.</p>

</div></div>","Stevia del Condado was founded in the year 2013 as a research project in the town of Navas de San Juan, Jaén. Jaen is located in the autonomous community of Andalusia, Spain. After various market research and other empirical studies on analysis of soil, the results threw a positive propensity to production and profitability.
We are a company dedicated to the commercialization of derivatives, such as herbs and teas with Stevia. Natural, organic and wild sometimes products are used for all.
In addition, the main product, the Stevia cultivation itself and produced in eco-friendly regime, has medicinal properties hardly comparable to any other Stevia, not only as natural sweetener.
Manuel Justiniano is an engineer in charge of Stevia production. The more complex labour resides in the selection of seeds that will integrate crops of this plant. This selection is obtained from parameters between experience, studies and lastly, relying on natural techniques such as bee pollination.

   
We need at
least 35,000 euros to improve the production chain. We want to be more
efficient and develop actions to be kinder to the environment.
We develop
specific machinery that is clean, innovative and useful. Until today we have
received many awards for our management, and we want to continue to rise.
Failure to
achieve the goal, we will use the money for the same thing, although we can not
develop the full, complete development and begin as soon as possible.

-------- En castellano / In spanish -----------------------------------------------------------------



Stevia del Condado nace en el año 2013 como un proyecto de investigación en la localidad de Navas de San Juan, Jaén. Jaén está situada en la Comunidad Autónoma de Andalucía, España.
Tras distintos estudios de mercado y otros estudios empíricos sobre analítica de suelo, los resultados arrojaban una propensión positiva a producción y rentabilidad. Somos una empresa dedicada a la comercialización de Stevia y derivados, como plantas aromáticas y tés con Stevia. Para todo ello se utilizan productos naturales, ecológicos y en algunos casos silvestres. Asimismo, el principal producto, la Stevia de cultivo propio y producido en régimen ecológico, tiene unas propiedades medicinales difícilmente comparables a cualquier otra Stevia, no solo como edulcorante natural.
Manuel Justiniano es el ingeniero encargado de la producción de Stevia. La labor más compleja reside en la selección de las semillas que van a integrar los cultivos de esta planta. Dicha selección se obtiene de parámetros comprendidos entre la experiencia, los estudios realizados con anteriores y por último, apoyándose en técnicas naturales como la polinización con abejas.




Necesitamos, al menos, 35000 euros para poder mejorar la
cadena de producción. Queremos ser más eficientes y desarrollar acciones para
ser mas respetuosos con el medio ambiente.
Desarrollaremos maquinaria específica que sea limpia,
innovadora y útil. Hasta hoy hemos recibido muchos premios por nuestra gestión,
y queremos seguir al alza.
En caso de no conseguir la meta, usaremos el dinero para el
mismo asunto, aunque no podamos desarrollar al completo, iniciaremos su
desarrollo y completarlo lo antes posible.

Logros 2015


En el año 2015, como primer año en comercialización en firme se ha asistido como expositor oficial a la Feria Internacional de Sevilla, Andalucía Sabor. Siendo una de las empresas revelación en la destacada cita.(http://www.andaluciasabor.com/uploads/expositor...abor_03.09.2015.pdf)

Through this event, families gain exposure to activities and services that will help them become physically fit thereby reducing the risk of obesity in their lives. Some of these activities include: fencing, tennis, soccer, golf, archery, volleyball, capoeira, gymnastics, basketball, baseball and much more. The sports clinics are conducted by over 35 Certified, Semi-Pro collegiate athletes.</p><p>As President of Body Sculpt of New York and a personal trainer, my mission has always been to help people attain their fitness goals so they can live healthier lives.

</div></div>","Who We Are: Experts You Can Trust
We are a team of friendly, dedicated doctors spearheading a free and cutting-edge platform to share the wisdom of practitioners from many healing disciplines.  Our core team
consists of a traditional medical doctor (Christopher Smith, M.D.), two
osteopathic doctors (Maryclaire O'Neill, D.O., and Jonathan Terry, D.O., ABIHM)
and a chiropractic physician (Kristin Gulliver, D.C).  Each of us has a
deep interest in health and
being able to promote education in free,
collaborative, and innovative ways. 
Each of our founding members is a recognized
expert in integrative health by fellowship
or board-certification.  
Why Desta?Our company is called “Desta Health.”  The word
""Desta"" means ""joy"" in two languages (Amharic and Tigrinya)
that originate from Eastern Africa.  We believe the quest
toward optimal health is one best guided by joy.
 Our goal is to
empower everyone’s path toward optimal health by providing meaningful
information and promoting legitimate integrative health modalities using multimedia content.  
What's On The Site?
We have created a free
and easily navigable internet database that delivers
reliable information on a variety of health and
wellness topics. As physician authors, we review the best literature and practices and
make this challenging content accessible for a high school reading
level.  All content on our site is viewable in desktop, mobile,
and tablet versions, so viewers can access us at home, in
the grocery store, or at their doctor's office. We host video and
text resources with high-quality links to outside
research and content.  Desta Health is a new endeavor, with an official
launch scheduled for March 2015. We invite you to visit our website. 
Please keep in mind, the website is still being constructed, so you will be
viewing a nearly finished product.   The official
domain name is www.destahealth.com       Screenshots of Desta search capability by 'Healing Therapy'  and 'Body System' 
Our High-Definition Videos
Recognizing that people learn in
different ways, many of our topics have accompanying high
definition videos. And keeping in mind the fast pace of our technology-driven
world, the average length of our videos is one to three minutes.
Our ""Everything-You-Need-to-Know Monographs""
When shopping for a nutritional product, who has time
to comb through the inconsistent and conflicting information on the web? Let
our doctors do the research for you.  Our articles range from simple ""monographs""
offering key information on dosing, side effects, cautions, and
conditions to in-depth articles summarizing the best research to
date.  Our articles cover non-nutritional topics as well, including breathing exercises for stress reduction, strategies for low back pain, and many other timely topics from the integrative health field. 
We Have Already Amassed 40+ (and
counting) Topics
Easily organized by Healing Therapy or by Body
System and complete with a powerful and integrated search,
readers can find the topic they want fast.  Fast as in check-out-lane
fast.   Best yet: all of our written and studio video content is completely free.
Some of our launch day topics include:


Turmeric


Fish Oil 


Echinacea


Behavioral Activation Treatment for Depression


Cancer Prevention


Super Foods


Osteopathic Manipulation


Chiropractic Techniques


Inflammation and Depression


Dementia


Ginger


CoQ10 (Ubiquinone)


Probiotics


Headaches


Low Back Pain


....and many more!



Desta At Home: Personalized Video
Consults With Our Leading Experts

Want to put it all together with a personal health consult?  The planned Video
Consultation service will put our practitioners' expert advice
directly in the hands of our viewers for a reasonable fee.  Our consults
will range from personalized education about how to ameliorate chronic disease to
how to prevent it.
Just imagine...this will be the most innovative integrative health video service, allowing people to consult with at diverse array of highly-qualified and carefully-screened practitioners: traditional
medical doctors (MDs), osteopathic physicians (DOs), chiropractors (DCs),
acupuncturists, herbalists, nutritionists, and other integrative health practitioners. Our
practitioners are held to the highest standards, are board-certified and/or fellowship trained in their consulting area, understand
the medical literature, and share a common perspective on health and
wellness.

An App?  You bet.
For on-the-go readers, it just
makes sense to develop a mobile application for iPhone and Android. 
Our website is the first step in this direction, as it is reactive and looks
beautiful on a mobile device.  We are in the process of starting the development of a dedicated mobile application.
Some features of this app may
include:



Quick access to our easy-to-read articles
and videos.  Imagine being able to have all of Desta's expert
resources at your fingertips. 


A map of
high-quality practitioners tailored to location and search
criteria.  


Real-time appointment scheduling for
our video consultation service.  


Among other useful features!

Moving Forward
Our company is at work
daily on what is quickly becoming a comprehensive database; and we are actively recruiting expert practitioners from
a variety of disciplines to add their writing and video
narratives, and join our consultation team.  Imagine being able
to easily connect with respected experts to guide your journey toward optimal
health. 
At Desta, we aim to become the most trusted world-wide resource for reliable, accurate information on optimal health and wellness.  We have begun with four integrative experts from across the United States. Stay tuned: our
team is about to become not just the best
panel of experts, but also the most
accessible consumer health resource to date.  We
believe this sort of resource has the ability to change health care in
a necessary and profound direction.

</div></div>","Short Summary
We are passionate about this project because it reaches persons who are in extreme situations of suffering and need. up! international has partnered with a local Cambodian organisation TPO and is impressed with the impact they are having. We want to ensure that this project which has been running for 3 years can continue! With your support we can ensure that:
1) Fewer prisoners suffer from mental illness and psychological problems and those with mental health issues can better manage their illnesses, the symptoms and associated behavioural problems.
2) Prisoners have improved social and relational skills to be able to live harmoniously with other prisoners, communicate to officials, manage anger and violent tendencies, relate better to family and increase empathy and understanding of others.
3) Prisoners have better ability to cope with the effects of incarceration and are better prepared to re-enter society, with greater skills and capabilities and clearer plans for the future.

<p><b>Where can I install a Vorty?</b></p>
<p>A Vorty controller is an
electronic trigger, therefore it can trigger electromagnetic locks on doors, doors' electric strikes, automatic garage doors, automatic gates, automatic barriers or
any other device that uses an electrical connection to operate.</p>
<p><b>What is the biggest advantage of the system?</b><br/></p>
<p>The best experience
is when you upgrade all of your entrances, home's doors, also your garage and gates.
Then you no longer need to worry about your keys and you just carry your phone. </p>
<p><b>What I need to make complete home's keyless system?</b></p>
<p>To do this you need Vorty Intro package to control your automated gates and garage and Vorty Doors package to control any doors.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Does it need batteries?</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>No, it does not. It uses a low voltage supply provided by the user.</p>
<p><b>Which smartphones are compatible with a Vorty?</b></p>
<p>There no technology
limits. It works with Android and iOS devices. It has been fully tested for Android
and iOS is in development. Windows phone are planned also for the future.</p>
<p><b>Can I install a Vorty by myself?</b></p>
<p>If you know what is
meant by “normally open” or “normally closed”, then most probably yes. There
are only four leads that have to be connected: two of them are for the low
voltage power and the other two are from a relay. There is a detailed
installation guide. If you are not certain how to connect with an existing
entrance device, please ask an electrician to help you.</p>
<p><b>Do you use Bluetooth?</b></p>
<p>We use a Bluetooth
signal to identify the user.</p>
<p><b>Is it Bluetooth 4.0?</b></p>
<p>No. We do not retrofit
deadbolts, therefore we are not forced to limit users only to Bluetooth4.0, which is a low energy system. Our access controller is
powered from the mains, so there no problems with the Bluetooth standard and
type of OS.</p>
<p><b>Why Bluetooth instead of NFC?</b></p>
<p>First, despite the growing
availability of NFC on smartphones, all phones have Bluetooth. Second, NFC
works only over very short ranges, at most a few centimeters, and cannot be
used for applications over any distance. A Vorty controller can be placed
conveniently inside a door, making it a perfect vandal-proof solution for all
smartphones, which would not be possible with NFC.</p>
<p><b>How near do I have
to be and how far away can I go to unlock my door, gate or garage?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>Vorty controller comes in two versions. In the Vorty doors package, we use a low-range antenna, which typically works up to 7 to 8 meters (about 22 ft). A lock installed inside and near to a door works over a range of 0.5 meters (1 ft 7 11⁄16 in) to 5 meters (16 ft) outside the door. Construction materials affect the range.</p>
<p>The Vorty controller for the gates / garage package comes with a better antenna, which increases the distance to 15 or 20 meters (50 or 65 feet) in direct sight.</p></span><p></p>
<p><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Is it secure?</b><br/></p>
<p>The Bluetooth
pairing between the lock and the phone is potentially at risk. A Vorty is
only a smartphone controlled system, which is always only in listening mode. It does not
interfere with your phone and is virtually tamperproof. We use a unique
approach to set up devices and issues keys without Bluetooth pairing.</p>
<p><b>How do you trigger a Vorty? What exactly is a
key?</b></p>
<p>A
key is unique BlueTooth signal of your phone. This signal becomes visible for
the short time when you tap an app or widget. This triggers device.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>How do I know that
no one else can use my app key?</b></p>
<p>The app itself is
not unique; it is just a shortcut for accessing your phone’s hardware-based
unique Bluetooth signal for a short time. It is impossible to give your virtual
key to anybody else without physically giving them your phone. </p>
<p><b>Can I give keys to
my house guests for 1 or 2 days only? </b></p>
<p>You can give access rights to your guests and then
revoke them at the end of their stay.</p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">How much of my
phone’s battery charge will it use?</b><br/></p>
<p>Each time you
trigger a Vorty Intro, you turn Bluetooth on just for 5 seconds. This has a tiny
influence on your phone’s battery charge.</p>
<p><b>What if my smartphone battery has no charge?</b></p>
<p>Since Vorty is designed to be an additional option, in most cases your existing key, proximity
card, keypad, etc. can still be used.</p>
<p><b>How do you set up keys?</b></p>
<p>To set up a new key,
you use an app called Vorty Master, which can be downloaded from Google Play or
our web page <a href=""http://www.vorty.eu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.vorty.eu</a><span>.</span> It
is free to use. It has a simple, intuitive wizard style.</p>
<p><b>What is a master key? </b></p>
<p>The first
registered user is given master key or administrator rights. Only a master can subsequent
issue keys.</p>
<p><b>What if I lose the
master phone or it’s broken? How do I reinstall it?</b></p>
<p>When you set up a new key, at the same time you can
also grant master rights to another family member or employee. In the worst
case, the hardware has a factory reset function. </p>
<p><b>Are upgrades
included?</b></p>
<p>Yes, future upgrades of the Vorty Key app and Master
app are included.</p>
<p><b>Is there a limit
to how many keys I can have for one lock</b>?</p>
<p>Yes, the maximum is
124</p>
<p><b>How fast does it react when I tap the widget?</b></p>
<p>This depends on how
fast your phone is and how well Bluetooth operates in your area, but normally
it takes about 0.1 to 2 seconds from tapping a key widget to the device being
triggered. </p>
<p><b>To use Vorty, what
kind of a lock do my doors need to have?</b></p>
<p>A door has to have an electromagnetic lock or electric strike first and then you add a Vorty controller as
a trigger. Vorty Door package includes electromagnetic lock which makes possible to upgrade any door.</p>
<p><b>Can you use a Vorty to open garage doors or
gates as well?</b></p>
<p>Yes, it is primarly designed and you can easily
adapt automatic garage or motorized gates by adding a Vorty Intro controller as a trigger.</p>
<p><b>Do you use Wi-Fi?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">No, we do not. We use Bluetooth for setup and control. Therefore, the system is not dependent on Wi-Fi coverage.</span><br/></p>
<p><b>Does
connecting Vorty Intro to the garage door, gates controller disable your
existing remotes?</b></p>
<p>No. You can keep using
your original remotes as usual.</p>
<p><b>How do you differ
from the others? What makes you better?</b></p>
<p>We are quite different.</p>
<p>Our concept
requires some wiring to integrate the system. This can be considered as disadvantage.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you
get reliable, affordable system that can be used with the vast majority of smartphones,
not just the latest ones. Vorty you use for a wide range of applications including garages
and gates, Vorty Doors package allow upgrade any doors which is great advantage comparing with deadbolts smart locks. </p>
<p>You also never need care about battery life, because Vorty uses mains power.</p>
<p>We use Bluetooth in
a secure silent mode, which makes our system completely different from others.</p>
<p>Finally, Vorty can
make you truly keyless. And there are no restrictions on the type of smartphone
or entranceway. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Does the Perks price include VAT or other taxes?</b></p>
<p>No, contributors must pay any taxes and duties related to the selected destination country. Tax, customs fees and other applicable customs charges are not included in the price of the Vorty Intro or Vorty Doors packages. Once we get close to the delivery date, we will ask you to confirm your shipping address and we will provide further instructions on handling VAT or any other applicable taxes.</p>

<p>First of all we have
not been in a rush. For three years, our product development has looked at countless
ideas. We have tested the system and avoided potentially buggy solutions, and tried
numerous prototypes. Well, it has been a bit of a hobby and primarily
we used Vorty for our own homes and we found ourselves excited how it's works.
Now we have a rugged, fully tested version, which we ready to share with you!</p>
<p>There may be a
small risk when upgrading your electronic entrance system if you are confused about
how it works. Please read the documentation for your existing automation controller
and ask an electrician for help if you have any doubts about installing a Vorty
Intro or Vorty Doors. We also provide ample documentation on our device. From an installer’s
point of view, it is only a trigger, similar to a light switch, and there is always
a simple way to integrate it with any other electric device.</p>
<p>At the moment, the
campaign has been launched, and the iOS app is still under development. This is
a clone of the Android app, therefore we do not consider this to be a difficult
task.</p>

On the
day we launched the campaign, we already had the first 50 PCB boards, so we can send assembled units to early adopters, our most
valuable beta customers, for an unbeatable price right now!<br/>

deadbolts, therefore we are not forced to limit users only to Bluetooth4.0, which is a low energy system. Our access controller is
powered from the mains, so there no problems with the Bluetooth standard and
type of OS.
Why Bluetooth instead of NFC?
First, despite the growing
availability of NFC on smartphones, all phones have Bluetooth. Second, NFC
works only over very short ranges, at most a few centimeters, and cannot be
used for applications over any distance. A Vorty controller can be placed
conveniently inside a door, making it a perfect vandal-proof solution for all
smartphones, which would not be possible with NFC.
How near do I have
to be and how far away can I go to unlock my door, gate or garage?


Vorty controller comes in two versions. In the Vorty doors package, we use a low-range antenna, which typically works up to 7 to 8 meters (about 22 ft). A lock installed inside and near to a door works over a range of 0.5 meters (1 ft 7 11⁄16 in) to 5 meters (16 ft) outside the door. Construction materials affect the range.
The Vorty controller for the gates / garage package comes with a better antenna, which increases the distance to 15 or 20 meters (50 or 65 feet) in direct sight.
Is it secure?
The Bluetooth
pairing between the lock and the phone is potentially at risk. A Vorty is
only a smartphone controlled system, which is always only in listening mode. It does not
interfere with your phone and is virtually tamperproof. We use a unique
approach to set up devices and issues keys without Bluetooth pairing.
How do you trigger a Vorty? What exactly is a
key?
A
key is unique BlueTooth signal of your phone. This signal becomes visible for
the short time when you tap an app or widget. This triggers device.

How do I know that
no one else can use my app key?
The app itself is
not unique; it is just a shortcut for accessing your phone’s hardware-based
unique Bluetooth signal for a short time. It is impossible to give your virtual
key to anybody else without physically giving them your phone. 
Can I give keys to
my house guests for 1 or 2 days only? 
You can give access rights to your guests and then
revoke them at the end of their stay.
How much of my
phone’s battery charge will it use?
Each time you
trigger a Vorty Intro, you turn Bluetooth on just for 5 seconds. This has a tiny
influence on your phone’s battery charge.
What if my smartphone battery has no charge?
Since Vorty is designed to be an additional option, in most cases your existing key, proximity
card, keypad, etc. can still be used.
How do you set up keys?
To set up a new key,
you use an app called Vorty Master, which can be downloaded from Google Play or
our web page www.vorty.eu. It
is free to use. It has a simple, intuitive wizard style.
What is a master key? 
The first
registered user is given master key or administrator rights. Only a master can subsequent
issue keys.
What if I lose the
master phone or it’s broken? How do I reinstall it?
When you set up a new key, at the same time you can
also grant master rights to another family member or employee. In the worst
case, the hardware has a factory reset function. 
Are upgrades
included?
Yes, future upgrades of the Vorty Key app and Master
app are included.
Is there a limit
to how many keys I can have for one lock?
Yes, the maximum is
124
How fast does it react when I tap the widget?
This depends on how
fast your phone is and how well Bluetooth operates in your area, but normally
it takes about 0.1 to 2 seconds from tapping a key widget to the device being
triggered. 
To use Vorty, what
kind of a lock do my doors need to have?
A door has to have an electromagnetic lock or electric strike first and then you add a Vorty controller as
a trigger. Vorty Door package includes electromagnetic lock which makes possible to upgrade any door.
Can you use a Vorty to open garage doors or
gates as well?
Yes, it is primarly designed and you can easily
adapt automatic garage or motorized gates by adding a Vorty Intro controller as a trigger.
Do you use Wi-Fi?


No, we do not. We use Bluetooth for setup and control. Therefore, the system is not dependent on Wi-Fi coverage.
Does
connecting Vorty Intro to the garage door, gates controller disable your
existing remotes?
No. You can keep using
your original remotes as usual.
How do you differ
from the others? What makes you better?
We are quite different.
Our concept
requires some wiring to integrate the system. This can be considered as disadvantage.
On the other hand, you
get reliable, affordable system that can be used with the vast majority of smartphones,
not just the latest ones. Vorty you use for a wide range of applications including garages
and gates, Vorty Doors package allow upgrade any doors which is great advantage comparing with deadbolts smart locks. 
You also never need care about battery life, because Vorty uses mains power.
We use Bluetooth in
a secure silent mode, which makes our system completely different from others.
Finally, Vorty can
make you truly keyless. And there are no restrictions on the type of smartphone
or entranceway. 

Does the Perks price include VAT or other taxes?
No, contributors must pay any taxes and duties related to the selected destination country. Tax, customs fees and other applicable customs charges are not included in the price of the Vorty Intro or Vorty Doors packages. Once we get close to the delivery date, we will ask you to confirm your shipping address and we will provide further instructions on handling VAT or any other applicable taxes.



First of all we have
not been in a rush. For three years, our product development has looked at countless
ideas. We have tested the system and avoided potentially buggy solutions, and tried
numerous prototypes. Well, it has been a bit of a hobby and primarily
we used Vorty for our own homes and we found ourselves excited how it's works.
Now we have a rugged, fully tested version, which we ready to share with you!
There may be a
small risk when upgrading your electronic entrance system if you are confused about
how it works. Please read the documentation for your existing automation controller
and ask an electrician for help if you have any doubts about installing a Vorty
Intro or Vorty Doors. We also provide ample documentation on our device. From an installer’s
point of view, it is only a trigger, similar to a light switch, and there is always
a simple way to integrate it with any other electric device.
At the moment, the
campaign has been launched, and the iOS app is still under development. This is
a clone of the Android app, therefore we do not consider this to be a difficult
task.

On the
day we launched the campaign, we already had the first 50 PCB boards, so we can send assembled units to early adopters, our most
valuable beta customers, for an unbeatable price right now!",54.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style="""">The last year I've decided to fly to Florida being part of a historical project of Spain</span><span style=""""> </span><span style="""">(El Galeón de Florida) </span><span style="""">as a volunteer.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style="""">Since the first day I've had a </span><span style="""">charming welcome of all the people I've met all these last months in Florida, and actually I can say I have a great friends, including my actual partner Gustavo Ramos</span><span style="""">.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style="""">Having some interesting conversations with him about gastronomy and the extra virgin olive oil, we started a good friendship relation and I've had the idea to start a business together taking advantage of putting together our skills and knowledge about the industry.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style="""">... and after eight months of a deep research and a hard promotional work, we have got the conclusion that the Jaen's Extra Virgin Olive Oil </span><span style="""">(</span><i style="""">Picual olive variety</i><span style="""">) </span><span style="""">is very difficult to find in the U.S., and the quality of the few ones I've found , is very low comparing to our oil.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style="""">We have been working </span><span style="""">very hard </span><span style="""">since the first day and we are very excited and happy to share this project with you.

ORIGIN OF OUR ""PICUAL"" EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OILS 

Our farms are privileged located in the Sierra de Magina, province of Jaen, Spain.  This geographical location and the type of our olives ""Picual variety"" enjoys a perfect climate conditions suitable for obtaining the highest quality oils and unique organoleptic qualities.







Olivar de Jaen produce today the result of years of intensive labour and acknowledge shared by the enthusiasm of our farmers and doing simply what’s right by compromising a deep commitment to quality, protecting the environment and engaging support for the local and rural economy.





Our farms' production is a portion of the majority of the World's olive oil, being since centuries the first and the most quality olive oil manufacturer worldwide.



HOW DO WE GET THE HIGHEST QUALITY?


We grow our ""PICUAL"" olives naturally avoiding the use of any harm products. 

Our Extra Virgin Olive Oils are handcrafted and manufactured following the traditional and most selective mechanical and centenary procedures to ensure the highest quality.









In the harvest season, we pick our olives by hand avoiding any mechanical intervention, and within two hours our olives are transported quickly to our ""Almazara"" (factory) to keep all their healthy benefits.

Once in our ""Almazara"", we use a cold-milled and slow pressing system to extract the oil.


Then, we storage it in stainless tanks to preserve it from the light and humidity.


Finally we bottle it in our traditional dark glasses or tins to continue keeping all the ""extra virgin"" attributes and we pack it to be shipped to the United States.







Olivar de Jaen is proud to produce the finest certified 
""PICUAL"" Extra Virgin Olive Oils 
being awarded in the most  prestigious international festivals like
New York and Los Angeles in 2014.




They exceed the maximum quality requirements of the United States, containing a
consistence a average acidity between 0-0,2 and delivering a
100% authentic and original product from Spain.
""I'm glad we can get finally the best Extra Virgin Olive Oil of Spain. Olivar de Jaen is importing it and selling it directly from Jaen. Juan Manuel Gomez has given me to try of their olive oil and I'm really impressed with the quality. The ""Picual variety olive"" is definitely the best.""

OUR STORY
First of all, we would like to tell you what ""Olivar de Jaen"" means: it comes from Jaen's olive tree farms and this name has been chosen to identify exactly where our olive oils come from.
The last year I've decided to fly to Florida being part of a historical project of Spain (El Galeón de Florida) as a volunteer.
Since the first day I've had a charming welcome of all the people I've met all these last months in Florida, and actually I can say I have a great friends, including my actual partner Gustavo Ramos.
Having some interesting conversations with him about gastronomy and the extra virgin olive oil, we started a good friendship relation and I've had the idea to start a business together taking advantage of putting together our skills and knowledge about the industry.
... and after eight months of a deep research and a hard promotional work, we have got the conclusion that the Jaen's Extra Virgin Olive Oil (Picual olive variety) is very difficult to find in the U.S., and the quality of the few ones I've found , is very low comparing to our oil.
We have been working very hard since the first day and we are very excited and happy to share this project with you. Our enthusiasm, the results of our research and the successful future customers' feedback after giving them to try our oils, were reasons enough to go ahead. 

RISKS
We feel very comfortable about our timeline. We’ve already finalized all major start up steps (95%) and we have all the product ready to ship from Spain to our warehouse in St. Augustine.

WHY INDIEGOGO
We have very good references of Indiegogo with other campaigns and how they could get their targets. 
Absolutely amazing. Connecting to new customers, fans and friends. This is a very good oportunity for us to meet in advance our future customers and start a loyal relation. 

HOW MUCH WE NEED TO LAUNCH OLIVAR DE JAEN?
We need $ 38.000 to start up and here you can see the areas where the money will be designated:



We will buy the first stock of the finest brands of Jaen's Extra Virgin Olive Oil internationally awarded (Soler Romero, Oro de Canavas, Alba Urgavo, Melgarejo, Oleocampo Supremo, Trujal de Magina, etc).

<p>I decided that I needed to focus on getting healthy.  I wasn't able to be active for about 2.5 years, after 4 surgeries to fix my arms.  I was not in a good state physically.  I started to run and do races, which is great rehabilitation.  My brother-in-law built me a competitive road bike, I trained hard and entered some biking races.  The spark was lit, I found it was a great way to get back into a healthy routine.  I decided to train and race at the National Duathlon Championship in St. Paul Minnesota.  If I qualified at this race it would allow me to compete at the World Championships.  I worked and trained hard and qualified.  It was a huge goal reached!  I made TEAM USA!  To attend the World Championship race would be a huge capstone to something I have worked hard to acheive.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Introducing Agkura™ Personal Score:</h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Blood test to monitor breast health</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">A revolutionary approach for your peace of mind</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>MAKING THINGS EASIER</strong></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What is the Agkura™ Personal Score?</strong></h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">OncoTAb’s cutting edge, patented technology was discovered by a leading breast cancer scientist and Mayo Clinic alumna. Agkura™ technology specifically detects a tumor protein that is overexpressed in more than 90% of breast cancer patients.</p>
<p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500488966/plhatlwa4kaylw5pg9ba.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500489022/p99j3bhha5rgjdgec8ol.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2> </h2>
<p>OncoTAb’s Agkura™ Personal Score is a <strong>revolutionary supplement to the standard mammogram</strong>. We all know or have heard of women whose mammograms have missed a cancerous tumor, sometimes too late.  The Agkura™ Personal Score provides peace of mind to women by offering a much-needed early warning system that supplements the standard mammogram.</p>
<p>This simple, non-invasive blood test is especially important for women with high-risk factors, including those with dense breast tissue, <strong>providing early warning signs</strong> when malignant cells in the breast start growing. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500489259/gyqfkb7txgqciwm4hyal.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>How the Agkura™ Personal Score</h2>
<h2>Benefits Women</h2>
<p>Mammography misses 50% of cancers in women with dense breast tissue often resulting in late stage diagnosis and mortality.</p>
<p>But, the Agkura™ Personal Score provides targeted, personalized information about a specific protein in your blood, giving you and your doctor crucial information about the state of your breast health. If your Personal Score is increasing, this triggers the need for additional imaging – perhaps an Ultrasound or an MRI – to allow for earlier diagnosis of breast cancer. Including this test in annual preventive care routines can result in diagnosing breast cancer years earlier. A detailed review of this test can be found in <a href=""http://www.impactjournals.com/Genes&amp;Cancer/files/papers/1/134/134.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Genes &amp; Cancer, May 21, 2017</strong></a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>For Those Impacted by Hard-To-Treat</h3>
<h3>Triple Negative Breast Cancer</h3>
<p>According to BreastCancer.org, “About 10-20% of breast cancers — more than 1 out of every 10 — are found to be triple-negative. For doctors and researchers, there is intense interest in finding new medications that can treat this kind of breast cancer.” For women who need to monitor for this cancer sub-type, there is the Agkura™ Personal Score, which can be used to screen for all breast cancer sub-types, including triple negative breast cancer.</p>
<p>The Agkura™ Personal Score sample collection kit can automatically be sent to you once or twice a year based on your risk, right on schedule, to make it convenient and easy to keep up to date on the status of your breast health. It’s as easy as 1-2-3. Sign up is available on our site <strong><a href=""http://www.Oncotab.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.OncoTAb.com</a></strong>.</p>

<h3>Rahul Puri, Ph.D.</h3>
<p>Rahul Puri, Ph.D., co-founder of OncoTAb, shares the type of scenario that we all want to eliminate. In 2015, Dr. Puri picked up a newspaper and saw the picture of a woman holding up her mammography report. The look in her eyes haunted him, the look of someone who had been cheated. It ends up that this woman was at high risk for breast cancer, yet her past five mammograms were all deemed normal. So, she was shocked when her gynecologist discovered a lump that was already the size of a tennis ball. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>This is your chance to help make a difference for all of humanity. Because breast cancer affects us all.</strong></h3>
<p>According to the American Cancer Society, there will be more than 1.6 million new cancer cases diagnosed in the United States annually. Each of us has lost someone precious due to breast cancer. So, it’s crucial to further cancer research and to bring Agkura™ Personal Score to the attention of doctors and women everywhere.</p>
<p>OncoTAb has received <strong>awards from the National Cancer Institute</strong> to initiate development of treatments for triple negative breast cancer and pancreatic cancer. The OncoTAb team believes that their technology may also lead to a test for <strong>early-stage pancreatic cancer</strong> and plan to devote research to this in the future.</p>

<h3>FAQs</h3>
<p><strong>1. What is Agkura™ Personal Score?</strong></p>
<p>The Agkura™ Personal Score is a simple blood test that measures the levels of tumor-associated MUC1, a protein that increases with cancer progression.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>2. How does the Agkura™ Personal Score aid in diagnosing breast cancer?</strong></p>
<p>The Agkura™ Personal Score can be used to monitor the levels of the tumor-associated MUC1 protein (or tMUC1) in each individual. A personal baseline value or score will be established for each person allowing us to detect changes from this baseline over time. A score above the normal range or a significant departure from your baseline value would trigger a recommendation for additional diagnostic imaging like ultrasounds and MRI. If you have dense breast tissue which can obscure breast cancer detection with mammography, using the Agkura™ Personal Score as a supplemental test gives you an additional independent measure to monitor your breast health.  <strong>In a blinded study, the Agkura™ Personal Score triggered the need for an ultrasound up to two years before diagnosis by mammography.</strong> Given the risks associated with high breast tissue density, we recommend that women with the dense tissue risk factor monitor their Agkura™ Personal Score every 6 to 12 months.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>3. Are there any guidelines for the blood draw for this test?</strong></p>
<p>A small amount of blood, ~ 3 mL, is needed to perform this non-invasive test. Consume normal levels of water prior to the blood draw.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>4. Where can I go to receive this test and how much will it cost?</strong></p>
<p>The Agkura™ Personal Score is performed in OncoTAb’s CLIA registered laboratory and has a retail cost of $199 per test, which includes all shipping and handling of sample collection kit to the customer and back to OncoTAb.  You can order the test through our website. A completed requisition form signed by you and your physician is required to perform the test.  Get your blood drawn at your physician’s office or a local laboratory (you may be charged a separate fee). More details on the process of getting your test can be found by clicking on the “ORDER NOW” button on our website.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>5. Does this test need to be done in conjunction with a mammogram or can it be performed independently of other diagnostic tests?</strong></p>
<p>Your Agkura™ Personal Score can be performed independently of other diagnostic tests. However, we do recommend that you continue using the breast cancer screening tests that are deemed appropriate for you by your physician.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>6. Can the Agkura™ Personal Score screen for triple negative breast cancer?</strong></p>
<p>The Agkura™ Personal Score can be used to screen for all breast cancer sub-types including triple negative breast cancer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>7. Can the Agkura™ Personal Score be used to monitor for breast cancer recurrence?</strong></p>
<p>Our studies have been focused on women at the first time diagnosis of breast cancer. Our data has shown that the Agkura™ Personal Score increases with each stage at diagnosis or the extent of disease progression. Given these results, we believe this test would be useful to monitor for recurrence in conjunction with current clinical practices. The best course of action is to talk to your physician to determine if this test should be part of your recurrence-monitoring plan. We will gladly speak to your physician and answer any questions he or she may have.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>8. Do I need to complete a requisition form each time I test?</strong></p>
<p>No. A completed requisition form signed by both you and your physician is required the first time you order the Agkura™ Personal Score blood test.  This form allows for ongoing monitoring.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>9. Is the test covered by insurance?</strong></p>
<p>Currently the Agkura™ Personal Score is not covered by insurance. Our goal is to have it included in private insurance coverage as soon as possible.</p>

Blood test to monitor breast health
A revolutionary approach for your peace of mind
 
MAKING THINGS EASIER
What is the Agkura™ Personal Score?
OncoTAb’s cutting edge, patented technology was discovered by a leading breast cancer scientist and Mayo Clinic alumna. Agkura™ technology specifically detects a tumor protein that is overexpressed in more than 90% of breast cancer patients.
 
 
OncoTAb’s Agkura™ Personal Score is a revolutionary supplement to the standard mammogram. We all know or have heard of women whose mammograms have missed a cancerous tumor, sometimes too late.  The Agkura™ Personal Score provides peace of mind to women by offering a much-needed early warning system that supplements the standard mammogram.
This simple, non-invasive blood test is especially important for women with high-risk factors, including those with dense breast tissue, providing early warning signs when malignant cells in the breast start growing. 
 

 
How the Agkura™ Personal Score
Benefits Women
Mammography misses 50% of cancers in women with dense breast tissue often resulting in late stage diagnosis and mortality.
But, the Agkura™ Personal Score provides targeted, personalized information about a specific protein in your blood, giving you and your doctor crucial information about the state of your breast health. If your Personal Score is increasing, this triggers the need for additional imaging – perhaps an Ultrasound or an MRI – to allow for earlier diagnosis of breast cancer. Including this test in annual preventive care routines can result in diagnosing breast cancer years earlier. A detailed review of this test can be found in Genes & Cancer, May 21, 2017.
 
For Those Impacted by Hard-To-Treat
Triple Negative Breast Cancer
According to BreastCancer.org, “About 10-20% of breast cancers — more than 1 out of every 10 — are found to be triple-negative. For doctors and researchers, there is intense interest in finding new medications that can treat this kind of breast cancer.” For women who need to monitor for this cancer sub-type, there is the Agkura™ Personal Score, which can be used to screen for all breast cancer sub-types, including triple negative breast cancer.
The Agkura™ Personal Score sample collection kit can automatically be sent to you once or twice a year based on your risk, right on schedule, to make it convenient and easy to keep up to date on the status of your breast health. It’s as easy as 1-2-3. Sign up is available on our site www.OncoTAb.com.
 


 
Dr. Pinku Mukherjee
Mayo Clinic alumna Dr. Pinku Mukherjee, pictured above, co-founded OncoTAb, Inc. to improve the quality of cancer care by addressing unmet diagnostic and treatment needs. She has been awarded the prestigious O. Max Gardner Award for her revolutionary discovery of an antigen that can detect when malignant cells in the body start growing – and it is her dream that people everywhere are routinely given this test. She has been involved in cancer research, starting at the Mayo Clinic, since 1998 and is now an Irwin Belk Distinguished Professor of Cancer Research at the University of North Carolina in Charlotte.
 

 
Rahul Puri, Ph.D.
Rahul Puri, Ph.D., co-founder of OncoTAb, shares the type of scenario that we all want to eliminate. In 2015, Dr. Puri picked up a newspaper and saw the picture of a woman holding up her mammography report. The look in her eyes haunted him, the look of someone who had been cheated. It ends up that this woman was at high risk for breast cancer, yet her past five mammograms were all deemed normal. So, she was shocked when her gynecologist discovered a lump that was already the size of a tennis ball. 
 
This is your chance to help make a difference for all of humanity. Because breast cancer affects us all.
According to the American Cancer Society, there will be more than 1.6 million new cancer cases diagnosed in the United States annually. Each of us has lost someone precious due to breast cancer. So, it’s crucial to further cancer research and to bring Agkura™ Personal Score to the attention of doctors and women everywhere.
OncoTAb has received awards from the National Cancer Institute to initiate development of treatments for triple negative breast cancer and pancreatic cancer. The OncoTAb team believes that their technology may also lead to a test for early-stage pancreatic cancer and plan to devote research to this in the future.

FAQs
1. What is Agkura™ Personal Score?
The Agkura™ Personal Score is a simple blood test that measures the levels of tumor-associated MUC1, a protein that increases with cancer progression.
 
2. How does the Agkura™ Personal Score aid in diagnosing breast cancer?
The Agkura™ Personal Score can be used to monitor the levels of the tumor-associated MUC1 protein (or tMUC1) in each individual. A personal baseline value or score will be established for each person allowing us to detect changes from this baseline over time. A score above the normal range or a significant departure from your baseline value would trigger a recommendation for additional diagnostic imaging like ultrasounds and MRI. If you have dense breast tissue which can obscure breast cancer detection with mammography, using the Agkura™ Personal Score as a supplemental test gives you an additional independent measure to monitor your breast health.  In a blinded study, the Agkura™ Personal Score triggered the need for an ultrasound up to two years before diagnosis by mammography. Given the risks associated with high breast tissue density, we recommend that women with the dense tissue risk factor monitor their Agkura™ Personal Score every 6 to 12 months.
 
3. Are there any guidelines for the blood draw for this test?
A small amount of blood, ~ 3 mL, is needed to perform this non-invasive test. Consume normal levels of water prior to the blood draw.
 
4. Where can I go to receive this test and how much will it cost?
The Agkura™ Personal Score is performed in OncoTAb’s CLIA registered laboratory and has a retail cost of $199 per test, which includes all shipping and handling of sample collection kit to the customer and back to OncoTAb.  You can order the test through our website. A completed requisition form signed by you and your physician is required to perform the test.  Get your blood drawn at your physician’s office or a local laboratory (you may be charged a separate fee). More details on the process of getting your test can be found by clicking on the “ORDER NOW” button on our website.
 
5. Does this test need to be done in conjunction with a mammogram or can it be performed independently of other diagnostic tests?
Your Agkura™ Personal Score can be performed independently of other diagnostic tests. However, we do recommend that you continue using the breast cancer screening tests that are deemed appropriate for you by your physician.
 
6. Can the Agkura™ Personal Score screen for triple negative breast cancer?

<p>Jaime and Jennifer Tanna are the founders of Energy Therapy, which began in 2005 not long after Jaime's father had a life threatening illness and fell into a coma. </p>
<p>As his father struggled to recover using standard medical care, Jaime desperately sought out alternative ways that could make a difference, and Energy Therapy was born!</p>
<p>Jennifer’s connection to energy healing and spirituality began early on in life, with influences from many teachings, including the Baha’i Faith. Holistic approaches to health were a way of life since she was a young child, and she has continued to develop her knowledge and awareness of the mind-body-spirit continuum throughout her professional career and personal life.</p>
<p>Both Jaime and Jennifer love helping others awaken to their true healing potential, and live vibrant, meaningful lives by following the path of higher intuition, creativity and joy. Together this dynamic duo bring a diverse array of energy-based wisdom and skills to the healing table, serving clients and students in many different countries worldwide.</p>
<p>Jaime was first guided onto the path of Raja Yoga by his maternal grandmother from a young age, and his early life experiences showed him how body and mind were unquestionably and intricately linked – beyond the outer form was an extraordinary presence that could heal both.</p>
<p>By having the courage to leave his salaried job in his late twenties and pursue energy healing as his vocation, he was able to experience and verify, first-hand, the powerful effects of this healing, both distant and ‘hands-on’, and witness remarkable improvements in his own health and his father’s – additionally, his father as a pharmacist and ‘man of science’ did not believe in energy healing at all, so this helped him understand that belief is not a requirement!</p>
<p>Both Jaime and Jennifer teach from a wellspring of deep knowledge and wisdom, linking the ancient teachings of yoga with energy medicine and deep intuitive insight. Together, they are dedicated to spreading the message of how meditation/mindfulness, energy medicine, yoga, remote healing combine to help transform consciousness, and deeply heal the body, mind and spirit.</p>
<p>We invite you to experience the power of energy work through our new e-learning platform and app in order to tap into your own inner wisdom, and we hope that here at Energy Therapy we can play a part in inspiring you to be the very best that you can be!</p>

I have achieved amazing growth on all levels - mentally, emotionally, spiritually and, of course, physically! Can't wait to learn more!"" Helena, Cyprus</i></p>
<p><i>""I loved working with you Jaime! Just want to report that when I measured my brain waves after every meditation I do, I got 94% congruency. The highest i have ever gotten was 72%! I feel like everything I have been working on with effort just started to flow."" Elle, USA</i></p>
<p><i>""I was highly sceptical of the healing session with Jaime as I’m 8000 miles away in Singapore and was wondering how effective could a remote healing be? I had nothing to lose and decided to give it a shot. I was proven so completely wrong!! I’ve started having a craving for salad and ‘healthy foods’, which is quite unlike me and I’ve slept like a log the first 2 nights. I feel more emotionally balanced and my cough is a lot better already. My back pain has lessened a lot too. I went for a massage today (5 days later) &amp; that didn’t leave me screeching in pain. My masseuse who massaged me a week back told me that my shoulders were not tight or blocked anymore."" S Kaur, Singapore</i></p>
<p><i>""I had an Indian Head Massage from Jennifer about 3 years ago when I lived near her in London, and it was amazing. In three years since moving away from Dulwich to Putney I hadn't had a better massage, so I recently contacted Jennifer to book in another appointment. The Indian Head Massage was again incredible and really helped release the tension I had been feeling in my neck, shoulders and the back of my head. I can recommend Jennifer as the best masseuse and energy worker I've ever been to and also as a great person! Jennifer gave me some good tips on how to help prevent the tension build up in the first place. First class service!"" Daniel, London, England </i></p>
<p><i>""Thank you for the online session Jaime. I've experienced amazing and significant shifts in my energy in the past 36 hours."" Susan, Wilmot, USA</i></p>
<p><i>""I recently had my second remote healing session with Jaime and had a tremendous experience. I had suffered night and day for 11 months from painful plantar fasciitis in both feet. I'm a massage therapist with a network of extraordinary colleagues, energy workers, and acupuncturists and no one had been able to help me. Jaime was extremely professional and friendly which immediately put me at ease. He is both grounded and intuitive n his approach. In short, my pain was 90% relieved that same day. It was truly astonishing. A week later it's about 99% gone with only occasional stiffness. In fact, my whole physical structure is being reorganized around this miraculous experience. Thank you Jaime!"" Lisa, New York, USA</i></p>
<p><i>""I decided to try an energy healing session with Jennifer as I was feeling completely depleted, and pretty stressed. I felt Jennifer was extremely intuitive in her assessment of areas that I could improve, and the psychological exercises she suggested to me were extremely useful, and did indeed bring about positive results. I had been slightly sceptical about Reiki, but the healing session was effective, and I felt more relaxed and definitely energised after the session. So much so, that I had 2 further sessions with similar positive results. I would highly recommend Jennifer and Energy Therapy!"" Martin, MD, Bournemouth, England</i></p>
<p><i>""Last year (2017) I was told I was in early menopause. I’d been struggling for over a year with hot sweats, migraines and out of control hormones. I just didn’t feel myself and the HRT therapies didn’t seem to help. So, I made a connection with Jaime because I needed to try something completely different. I’ll be honest, I was a little reticent to believe in the effectiveness of remote healing, but I am so pleased I opened my mind enough to try. The results were astonishing! In ONE session Jaime turned my early menopause quite literally on its head. After months of symptoms, everything suddenly settled. My cycles have never been so regular and I feel so much better balanced. It completely baffled my GP... "" Jo, England</i></p>
<p><i>""Thank you for the remote healing session. My neck pain has disappeared and the pain in my feet has reduced significantly. I wasn't sure what I was expecting to happen but I was, and still am, really amazed that a lot of physical pain has disappeared"" Uma, England </i></p>
<p><i>""I just wanted to write to you to let you know of our good news. I am 6 months pregnant with a little girl on the way! Last year was a real struggle in terms of fertility. My husband and I made an appointment at the IVF clinic to get all the information once and for all so as to make an informed and final decision. And bang, the evening before that first IVF appointment we found out we were naturally pregnant after the healing sessions with you... What a wonderful, miraculous turn of events!  Your input, guidance and your amazing remote healing sessions have all truly contributed to a beautiful outcome for me and I wanted to pass on my sincere thanks for the wonderful work you do in making this world a better place!"" Nicole, Lagos, Nigeria</i></p>
<p><i>""I went to Jennifer for a couple of energy healing sessions and I found her to be very warm, kind and compassionate. She explained everything with such amazing clarity which helped me progress in my healing journey. And she empowered me to seek clarity and answers within myself. I felt so much more grounded and emotionally balanced just after the first session. I would be very happy to recommend Jennifer to anyone seeking healing and balance."" Anney, London, England</i></p>
<p><i>""Having had a persistent rash on my lower legs for 6 years which conventional medicine, reiki, acupuncture, homeopathy, reflexology, medical herbalism etc didn't shift, I booked a remote healing session with Jaime. To my delight and amazement the rash started fading immediately and now, 16 weeks later, it has gone. His charming professionalism inspired immediate confidence, but it is the success of the treatment which speaks for itself."" Susan Lyall, London, England</i></p>
<p><i>""Jaime is a God send! I originally booked an energy session to help deal with insomnia and feelings of overwhelment. Just two days after the first session I felt much calmer - and to my amazement my insomnia had completely disappeared, enabling me to feel more refreshed, energised and able to deal with life! As these issues had been completely transformed with such success I wondered if Jaime could help with my back and neck pain, I had been working with a chiropractor for the last eight years. After the first session the symptoms were 50% better, on the second session they had completely disappeared. Jaime easily clears and heals physical aliments that have proved difficult to shift via the usual conventional means. Thank you Jaime!” Sarah, Senior Psychotherapist, London, England</i></p>
<p><i>""I  had an extraordinarily successful healing experience after an appointment with Jaime. Having broken my femur badly, and had a metal plate put in, the bone was still not mended after 9 months. I had had an X-ray and the Fracture Consultant at an Orthopaedic Hospital had told me there was a possibility of it never mending, what they call 'non-union', very worst case scenario could be amputation! Someone recommended I see Jaime. I honestly did not know what to expect, but came away with a strong feeling of well being. After a follow up session with Jaime, I returned to the hospital for my next appointment, had an X-ray, and the consultant simply said, ""That looks good now, I think it's time to start weight bearing"", and I have not looked back since! Sometimes we have to accept there are things we will never understand in a conventional way!"" Caroline, London, England</i></p>
<p><i>""I received a reflexology session from Jennifer. It lasted for one hour but I was so relaxed and felt that the session had lasted for three hours. Whenever she found tension in parts of my foot, I felt her using energy to ease the stress - I felt a soothing warmth on my feet whenever she did it. When the treatment was finished I felt so relaxed and refreshed. Highly recommend!"" Heidi, Surrey, England</i></p>
<p><i>""I saw Jaime in person and also remotely (via Skype) for chronic double disc prolapse and nerve root damage pain. After just one session, my pain was - and still is - greatly reduced and I have much more movement/flexibility in my body. I have been suffering from serious pain for over 4 years - with traditional methods of injections, medication and such, not making much difference! I advocate having healing with Jaime for anyone seeking relief from such physical ailments and pain. This isn't placebo in the medical, negative sense. This is truly a remarkable way of addressing the root energetic cause of pain1"" Graeme, London, England</i></p>
<p><i>""I had back pain for some years and tried different approaches, medical and alternative alike, that did not work so well. After some healing sessions with Jaime and Jennifer I really felt a big difference. It's been a few months and I don't have any sort of excruciating and debilitating pain anymore. Additionally the allergies I used to have and that they did some treatment on totally disappeared! I felt very comfortable with both of them and I think it has been a very good experience for me and I will definitely come back again if I have any sort of pain/health problem.It really made a difference!"" Joana, England</i></p>
<p><i>""I had severe pain in my spine and the doctor said that my spine was twisted from top to toe. Every vertebra was practically in a different position. So no wonder I could not stand on both feet happily at the same time! Then, after the remote energetic healing work that Jaime did, I felt an enormous heat in the middle of the night in my spine/body, and I slept amazingly deeply. My back felt good. And then, quite remarkably, two days later, all pain vanished. I am pain free for the first time for years and am able to balance much better than before as the vertebrae seem to be readjusting."" Sabine, Austria</i></p>
<p><i>""It's been several days since my remote healing with Jaime, and I'm a little bit amazed at how much better I'm feeling. I didn't doubt that the therapy would help, but I was quite sceptical about the speed at which it's supposed to start working. After the energy session, I felt this odd sense of peace and wellness for a while and I was able to lie down with my eyes closed, without any anxiety or panic - this hasn't happened for years! Yesterday I woke up in a rush of anxiety but it didn't last long. And today I've woken up -for the first time in weeks- without any despair or anxiety. I'm feeling light and energised, and I actually feel able to tackle big and small chores without feeling overwhelmed. Here's something interesting also - for the last several months, I have been pretty much living on painkillers, thanks to an old shoulder injury that returned with a vengeance. I've been worried about the impact on my liver/kidneys, of so many meds, while I wait for a physiotherapy appointment. I just realised on Sunday that for the first time in about 6 months, I went for a whole 48 hours without any pain meds- and without any pain! It's quite amazing!"" Simran, England </i></p>

<p>Even if you can't help fund our campaign, if you believe in a world where people can have access to powerful tools for self-healing, and become less reliant on drugs and external methods of dealing with pain and suffering (which clearly don't work a lot of the time!) then please share this campaign with your friends, family and anyone else you think would be interested!</p>
<p>If you know anyone in the press who would be happy to share this campaign in a positive light, then please do pass it on!  We'd be thrilled to have that kind of support!</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for reading this far! :)</strong></p>

</div></div>","We invite you to experience the power of energy work through our new e-learning platform and app. Learn to tap into your own inner wisdom, and transform all aspects of your life. We hope that here at Energy Therapy we can play a part in inspiring you to be the very best that you can be!



 


The world around us seems to be spiralling into chaos and dysfunction. We're hoping to make a difference by helping people on a very personal level.  

By having access to expert guidance, anytime, anywhere, it can help bring about a radical shift in our thinking and consciousness.  You will learn how to shift your frequency -- fast!
We started off from very humble beginnings, working out of one tiny room in Jaime’s London apartment to the massive online presence of 2 Million followers that we have today.
Our work is rooted in direct experience, helping others one to one and in groups, both in person and online. We've walked the path of fire too, using these powerful wisdom teachings to navigate major crises in our own lives. Our client and student testimonials below speak for themselves - we simply want to impact people on a larger scale now - and we need your help to do this!
The main hurdle of finding a quality technology company to create the e-platform and app, along with a film and editing crew that are experts in the their respective fields and worth the high price has already been overcome.  Developing the technology and the content will demand huge amounts of time, money and energy!
The tech company and film crew both understand that if we don't hit our goal, we'll have to make changes in the way we create this - however, we're fully committed to this project - and to you. There's no going back now!
We absolutely know in our hearts that this information needs to be out there - so many people have asked us how they can learn what we know, especially when they can't come to learn in person with us.
We really need YOU to make it really shine and to help us make the impact it deserves, and we're hugely grateful for your wonderful support!


Our new e-learning platform and app will enable you to have access to timeless, powerful teachings anywhere in the world!  Blending Energy Medicine with yoga, meditation/mindfulness, chakra work, breathwork, energy psychology, sound healing and more.  The dynamic interplay of these approaches to living an integrated life will create powerful changes in your mind and body, because your spirit will be involved all the way through.
We're excited to say we've already completed the first stage of building the e-learning platform from our own efforts and from our own pockets. 
Now we really need your support to make our vision a living, breathing reality! :)
As well as delivering the highest quality film and audio production in terms of content -- shooting the footage, editing, sound production etc - and getting it to you in good time. We need to invest substantially more to make the e-platform even more robust, and a breeze to use.  This includes building flexible layouts and search functionality in, tagging of keywords, saving content, sending out reminders, and so much more. 
We also need to start building the mobile app to make these teachings even more accessible to everyone, everywhere. 
Once this has been accomplished we are also looking to partner with an additional  tech company to measure the dynamic healing frequencies of the body-mind continuum, plus recording & charting heart and brain waves before and after doing each technique and process on the platform and app, so you can chart your own energy healing journey, and see just how far you’ve come.
So far, we've already put tens of thousands of dollars out of our own pocket into building the e-learning website/e-platform, so we're looking for a timely and much needed boost to help us go on further and finish what we've started... and maybe take us into uncharted territory - for the benefit of all!





Jaime and Jennifer Tanna are the founders of Energy Therapy, which began in 2005 not long after Jaime's father had a life threatening illness and fell into a coma. 
As his father struggled to recover using standard medical care, Jaime desperately sought out alternative ways that could make a difference, and Energy Therapy was born!
Jennifer’s connection to energy healing and spirituality began early on in life, with influences from many teachings, including the Baha’i Faith. Holistic approaches to health were a way of life since she was a young child, and she has continued to develop her knowledge and awareness of the mind-body-spirit continuum throughout her professional career and personal life.
Both Jaime and Jennifer love helping others awaken to their true healing potential, and live vibrant, meaningful lives by following the path of higher intuition, creativity and joy. Together this dynamic duo bring a diverse array of energy-based wisdom and skills to the healing table, serving clients and students in many different countries worldwide.
Jaime was first guided onto the path of Raja Yoga by his maternal grandmother from a young age, and his early life experiences showed him how body and mind were unquestionably and intricately linked – beyond the outer form was an extraordinary presence that could heal both.
By having the courage to leave his salaried job in his late twenties and pursue energy healing as his vocation, he was able to experience and verify, first-hand, the powerful effects of this healing, both distant and ‘hands-on’, and witness remarkable improvements in his own health and his father’s – additionally, his father as a pharmacist and ‘man of science’ did not believe in energy healing at all, so this helped him understand that belief is not a requirement!
Both Jaime and Jennifer teach from a wellspring of deep knowledge and wisdom, linking the ancient teachings of yoga with energy medicine and deep intuitive insight. Together, they are dedicated to spreading the message of how meditation/mindfulness, energy medicine, yoga, remote healing combine to help transform consciousness, and deeply heal the body, mind and spirit.
We invite you to experience the power of energy work through our new e-learning platform and app in order to tap into your own inner wisdom, and we hope that here at Energy Therapy we can play a part in inspiring you to be the very best that you can be!

These powerful testimonials show you why we are qualified to teach you all you need to know about the power of Energy Medicine to heal, transform and bless your life!
""My journey has certainly been an incredible one with Energy Therapy! Jaime and Jennifer make a super team, with their combined expertise. I have achieved amazing growth on all levels - mentally, emotionally, spiritually and, of course, physically! Can't wait to learn more!"" Helena, Cyprus
""I loved working with you Jaime! Just want to report that when I measured my brain waves after every meditation I do, I got 94% congruency. The highest i have ever gotten was 72%! I feel like everything I have been working on with effort just started to flow."" Elle, USA
""I was highly sceptical of the healing session with Jaime as I’m 8000 miles away in Singapore and was wondering how effective could a remote healing be? I had nothing to lose and decided to give it a shot. I was proven so completely wrong!! I’ve started having a craving for salad and ‘healthy foods’, which is quite unlike me and I’ve slept like a log the first 2 nights. I feel more emotionally balanced and my cough is a lot better already. My back pain has lessened a lot too. I went for a massage today (5 days later) & that didn’t leave me screeching in pain. My masseuse who massaged me a week back told me that my shoulders were not tight or blocked anymore."" S Kaur, Singapore
""I had an Indian Head Massage from Jennifer about 3 years ago when I lived near her in London, and it was amazing. In three years since moving away from Dulwich to Putney I hadn't had a better massage, so I recently contacted Jennifer to book in another appointment. The Indian Head Massage was again incredible and really helped release the tension I had been feeling in my neck, shoulders and the back of my head. I can recommend Jennifer as the best masseuse and energy worker I've ever been to and also as a great person! Jennifer gave me some good tips on how to help prevent the tension build up in the first place. First class service!"" Daniel, London, England 
""Thank you for the online session Jaime. I've experienced amazing and significant shifts in my energy in the past 36 hours."" Susan, Wilmot, USA

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Thirst Quench Hydrating Mask</h3>
<p>Thirst Quench Hydrating mask is deeply hydrating and will help maintain the moisture balance in the skin. The mask is revitalizing and the skin will feel smoother and more radiant.</p>
<p><u><strong>Key Ingredients:</strong></u></p>
<p><u>Niacinamide:</u> Niacinamide is an active form of Vitamin B<sub>3</sub>. Niacinamide forms the essential constituent of the oxidoreduction coenzymes NAD and NADP, which decline with age in our skin. NAD and NADP are essential in the metabolism of cells.  Niacinamide has shown great effect on enlarged pores, fine lines and uneven skin tones. It is anti-inflammatory, strengthens the elasticity of the skin and reduces skin sensitivity. Who wouldn’t want this?</p>
<p><u>Sodium Hyaluronate: </u>Sodium Hyaluronate is the sodium salt of hyaluronic acid. It has the same benefits as hyaluronic acid but is more easily absorbed. Hyaluronic acid and sodium hyaluronate can attract and hold large amounts of moisture which makes it a powerful hydrating ingredient. It will plump the skin which will in turn diminish fine lines, even out skin tone and texture as well as increase skin radiance. Amazing!</p>
<p><u>Panthenol: </u>Also known as Provitamin B<sub>5</sub>. Panthenol has the ability to bind water to the skin and is very hydrating. It also has anti-inflammatory properties and can help calm irritated and sensitive skin. Good for everyone!</p>
<p><u>Amino acid complex: </u>Amino acids play a vital role in maintaining our health as well as the appearance of the skin. Amino acids are found naturally in the skin and works as natural moisturising factors (NMF’s). Their main benefit in skin is to maintain skins hydration and smoothness. In skincare, amino acids aid in strengthening our skin’s natural defence system and in turn help protect from environmental damage to the skin. Get strong!</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Fresh Start Hydrating Mask</h3>
<p>Fresh Start Exfoliating mask is exfoliating and deeply hydrating. The mask will make the skin feel brighter and more radiant as well as help even out the skin tone.</p>
<p><strong><u>Key Ingredients:</u></strong></p>

It will plump the skin which will in turn diminish fine lines, even out skin tone and texture as well as increase skin radiance. Amazing!</p>
<p><u>AHA’s: </u>Glycolic and lactic acid to gently exfoliate and hydrate the skin. We have used a low concentration of Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHA’s) in this mask for the purpose of a single use formula and using the full 30ml all at once. It provides a gentle exfoliation that suits even a more sensitive skin type. AHA is a chemical exfoliation, which means it loosens up the bonds between the skin cells in the upper layers. It also helps the skin retain moisture. The result is hydrated and smooth looking skin.  </p>
<p><u>Licorice root extract: </u>One of the components in licorice, glabridin, is a powerful antioxidant as well as being skin-soothing. There is also evidence supporting licorice root extract improving an uneven skin tone. This s why we find it being the perfect complement to AHA, it helps to soothe any irritation that may arise from using AHA for the more sensitive skin, as well as work together with the AHA on making the skin tone more even. Simply the perfect combo!</p>

<h2>Jock Itchy that bugs you big time</h2>
<p><strong>S</strong>tudies show that many men suffer from jock itchy, tinea cruris, which is a fungal infection of the skin. Jock itch is caused by mold-like fungi, and they can multiply quickly and cause infections when they are allowed to thrive in warm, moist area where happens to be your groin.</p>

We’re here to try and help you and the millions of other women who have monthly period pain. If every woman with period pain donated $5, we could begin on this solution tomorrow. When Sally started menstruating, her periods were painful – so her doctor told her to take Ibuprofen. Initially, it worked. Sally could return to class, sports, and hanging out with her friends, without pain. But Sally took a lot of Ibuprofen every month and more than the recommended amount, just like a lot of her friends. After years of taking Ibuprofen, she began having stomach pain. Her doctor recommended Sally stop taking Ibuprofen. Without the Ibuprofen, Sally’s period pain came back, and she found herself missing work.This time, Sally’s doctor put her on birth control pills. The hope was that this would work, but it didn’t stop the pain like Ibuprofen had. And now Sally feels bloated constantly, feels sick to her stomach, and is having headaches. Besides the side effects, Sally wants to begin having children soon, but she’s worried that if she goes off the birth control, the pain will come back. Sally doesn't want to go back to taking Ibuprofen. But Sally doesn’t know of any other options. So now what should Sally do?Sally’s case is so common and illustrates the limitation in current medical treatments for period pain. Ibuprofen and birth control work for a lot of women, but they don’t work for everyone. We believe women should have more options for such a common problem.Why don’t we have more options?* Sally is a fictitious character only meant to illustrate the problem. :) We’re hoping the plant, Pau d’ Arco, may offer a solution. Many plants are used as medicine, and this plant has been used in South America for over 1,000 years, but hasn’t been used much in the U.S. There’s a lot of technical reasons that we want to use this particular plant. Mostly, because we think it decreases inflammation (inflammation is what causes period pain) and it's completely natural. Previous studies in people have shown this plant medicine to be generally safe for use in humans, and we need more research to determine the safety and usefulness of this plant for period pain.

To see if Pau d’ Arco works in the way we think it might, we need to do more research. Specifically, we need to start with a clinical trial. This first clinical trial will examine whether Pau d’ Arco is, or isn’t, as safe as we think it is. Why are we trying to fund the trial this way? We could try to get funding through more traditional sources, but this can take years and funding is very limited. This way, we’ll be able to get started and help women more quickly! Since this is a problem that affects so many women, this trial could be conducted much more quickly with grassroots fundraising. 
We are looking to raise 35k for use in clinical trials to test Pau d’ Arco. These trials are critical to moving the process forward.
Your contribution will help push women's health forward and hopefully provide new options in a limited market that could impact women across the US and beyond.
We are in the process of collecting some unique perks for your contributions!

<h3>What is QueerWell?</h3>
<p>QueerWell is the first-ever digital platform devoted to the health, happiness, and well-being of LGBTQIA+ people (and their allies). </p>
<p>Whit will draw on their rich life experience as a neurodiverse, LGBTQIA+ womxn and non-binary human to create this platform.</p>
<p>We need your help getting QueerWell from an idea and a concept — into a reality. <strong>Because Queers deserve to be happy, too. </strong></p>
<h3>Why QueerWell? </h3>
<p>According to <a href=""https://news.gallup.com/poll/175418/lgbt-americans-report-lower.aspx?utm_source=add_this&amp;utm_medium=addthis.com&amp;utm_campaign=sharing#.U_sedDuhjaU.twitter"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">research</a>, LGBTQIA+ Americans report lower well-being than their non-queer counterparts, even after factoring in differences of race and socioeconomic status. The Atlantic has dubbed the well-being of Queer Women, in particular, <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/08/the-quiet-crisis-among-queer-women/379404/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">a ""Quiet Crisis.""</a></p>
<p>The tech industry has responded to the unique needs of LGBTQ+ folks through the creation of apps devoted to sex and love. And while this is important, <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/queering-psychology/202002/what-does-queering-psychology-mean"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Queer mental health and happiness run</a> deeper than our sex lives.</p>
<p>What if an app existed to respond to the unique emotional and psychological challenges of being Queer? </p>
<p>Of the $1.3 billion dollar Mindfulness industry, there is a tremendous gap and lack of attention to the <strong>Queer Generation and their specific needs</strong>. Whit identifies with many letters of the Queer Alphabet (L, G, T, and of course, Q) and they’re passionate about bridging the gap. </p>
<p>A trained therapist, former psychological well-being researcher, and mindfulness instructor, Whit spent nearly a decade working in academia, mental health, and wellness start-ups without ever hearing a conversation about the specific needs of Queer people. QueerWell seeks to change this.</p>
<p><strong>In the midst of COVID-19,</strong> the need for a digital wellness space has never been greater.</p>
<p>Enter QueerWell, <strong>the first-ever app devoted to the health, happiness, and well-being of LGBTQIA+ people (and their allies)</strong>. Whit is a fierce, resilient, business and tech-savvy leader who left behind their role on the therapist couch to reach a broader audience. They've devoted their entire career to serving under-resourced communities and believe QueerWell can reach Queer folks where they are: on their phones!</p>
<p>But, Whit also recognizes QueerWell-<i>ness</i> is about more than just meditations. And, they recognize the tremendous diversity of the Queer community in terms of race, language, ethnicity, immigration status, gender, geographic location, ability/disability, and more. </p>
<p>They seek to develop an adaptive app with <a href=""https://clearbridgemobile.com/artificial-intelligence-driving-future-mobile-app-personalization/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">cutting edge technology</a>. QueerWell will get to know the preferences of its user through a diverse content library of art, writing, music, and fitness videos that QueerWell subscribers can choose from to best suit their mental health needs and Queer happiness goals.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>QueerWell is in the pre-concept stage, and needs your financial support to grow from an idea and into a reality.</p>
<p>Ideally, QueerWell will launch in time for Election Season 2020 — a very stressful time to be Queer. </p>
<p>This initial round of funding for $15,000 will go towards: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>TECHNOLOGY:</strong> Purchasing video and sound equipment for the creation of high-quality digital mindfulness and marketing content. Prototype development technology.</li>
<li>
<strong>MENTORSHIP:</strong> Consulting with tech and business experts to support, develop and refine the QueerWell business plan and financial strategy. </li>
<li>
<strong>FEES:</strong> The fun part! All of the legal, accounting fees associated with QueerWell operating as a fully-functional business. This includes trademarking, incorporating as a business, and tax compliance. </li>
<li>
<strong>MARKETING:</strong> Website design, marketing materials, branding, SEO, and securing domains.</li>
<li>
<strong>COMPENSATION:</strong> Hiring and paying a diverse team of content creators, operations support and tech whizzes for business development. </li>
<li>
<strong>TEAM:</strong> Identification of tech geniuses to develop the app itself from Whit’s prototype. Whit wants the best technology for QueerWell, and that has a price tag beginning at $100K. Network at industry conferences such as <a href=""https://lesbianswhotech.org/sanfrancisco2020/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lesbians Who Tech</a> (COVID-19 allowing). </li>
<li>
<strong>RESEARCH:</strong> Focus groups with QueerWell’s target market to listen to and continue identifying needs of consumers within the platform.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>QueerWell will run on a tiered subscription model, designed with different levels of access to content.</strong></p>
<p> In this spirit, those that donate to QueerWell’s current campaign will receive:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$1-99:</strong> For every $1 donated, 1-day of access to a QueerB (Queer Basic) subscription. </li>
<li>
<strong>$100-250:</strong> For every $1 donated, 1-day of access to a Queer+ (Queer Plus) subscription.</li>
<li>
<strong>$251-1000:</strong> 1-year free subscription to Queer+, and the opportunity to gift a month free of QueerB to three people.</li>
<li>
<strong>$1000 - 4999:</strong> 1-year free subscription to Queer+, infinitely good karma, as well as a 1:1 conversation with Whit (via Video) with their sincerest thanks and to hear your input on the direction of QueerWell. </li>
<li>
<strong>$5,000+ Beyond:</strong> Lifetime Subscription to QueerWell. Yep, you heard that right. QueerJoy to last a lifetime.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>If you don't want access to QueerWell but still want to give to this campaign, you can gift your reward to a Queer person in need (or two or three).</i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>QueerWell believes all Queer folks deserve to ""Live Well, Be Well, QueerWell” and is devoted to the improved accessibility of wellness content for Queer People.</p>
<p>QueerWell imagines a world where all Queers (and their family members and friends) can take out their phones and find holistic content relevant to their lives and happiness, at any time day or night.</p>
<p>A sampling of themes for the QueerWell app meditation series:</p>
<ul>
<li>Living With Chronic Illness (Auto-Immune Conditions, Lyme Disease, HIV/AIDS)</li>
<li>Coming Out of the Closet</li>
<li>Supporting a Partner/Friend Through a Gender Transition</li>
<li>Supporting a Child as They Come Out of the Closet </li>
<li>Questioning Your Sexuality or Gender Identity Series</li>
<li>Holistic content delivery with the inclusion of art, writing, fitness, and more.</li>
<li>
<strong>""Queerspañol"":</strong> bilingual Spanish + English wellness content, meditations, and more for the Latinx community and allies. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Tech's Diversity Gaps &amp; LGBTQIA Entrepreneurs</h3>
<p>It’s common knowledge that the tech industry, as a whole, <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/06/tech-computers-are-bigger-problem-diversity/592456/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">has a diversity problem</a>. It’s estimated that 90% of venture capital funding goes to white men. </p>
<p>Venture capitalists like <a href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/90227793/backstage-capitals-arlan-hamilton-brings-diversity-to-venture-capital"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Arlan Hamilton</a> are making waves by funding underrepresented entrepreneurs, seeking to change the face of entrepreneurship in the U.S. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, Whit recognizes this lack of diversity will be an obstacle facing them on the road ahead as they found a company run by Queer People (and allies) for Queer people.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand that times are difficult for many amidst COVID-19. If you aren't able to give financially at this time, please consider supporting in one of the following ways: </p>
<ul>
<li>Spread the word far and wide with people who you think might be psyched to support a company like QueerWell! Share this to your social; text it to your friends! </li>
<li>Sign up for updates to QueerWell's progress at <a href=""https://www.queerpsych.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">QueerWell.co </a>
</li>
<li>Consider mentoring Whit and investing in them as a human. Or, connect them to people you believe can help Whit move this dream into a concrete digital reality. <a href=""https://www.whiteaston.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tech-savvy, queer geniuses (or allies), need apply!</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, this campaign is the launch of what will be a long road of development for QueerWell, but truly, any dollar donated today is fundamental and invaluable to our growth and development. </p>
<p>My question to you is: What would QueerWell, a cutting-edge and unprecedented radical digital Queer wellness community, right in your pocket, be worth to you? </p>
<p>May you ""Live Well, Be Well, QueerWell,"" my friends. Your support means the world to me. </p>
<p>With gratitude,</p>
<p>Whit, Founder of QueerWell (and our future Badass team of diverse humans)</p>

This feature gives you or a loved one the ability to always have a handle with good ergonomics which doesn't cause pain.The diameter and the material of the handle allow a gentle grip that doesn’t cause additional pain.The pressure placed on the painful areas of the hand is insignificant. •INDEPENDENCE :The users will be able to eat by themselves without help from others.•JOY OF EATING: Eating is no longer a chore, this essential gesture becomes pleasurable again.•INCLUSIVENESS: The product allows people to participate in social activities, and not feel isolated.   ACT is the result of two years of study of the disease, research with university teachers and mentors from the accelerator. We sketched, modeled and tested materials intensively.Each prototype was tested by beneficiaries and constantly improved based on their direct feedback.

Instead, your body will be filled with the oxygen-rich hydration that it craves.    Hexagonal water in the body generates ""Exclusion Zones“ Within the millions of layers of hexagonal water/exclusion zones no atom, no molecule and no virus can stay and will, therefore, be pressed to the surrounding bulk water from where it can be transported much easier out the cells/body.  
These exclusion zones begin directly at the cell membranes and nucleus membranes and protect those areas in the meaning that they will be protected from being directly connected with the spikes of viruses, which tend to „hack“ the DNA of cells. 
The hexagonal layers are always negatively loaded inside human bodies and neutralize positively charged hydronium ions; this leads to a beneficial regulation of the acidity level.In a better alkaline environment, all immune system responses to viruses are improved, including the intra-cellular functioning of the mitochondria as part of the immune system by producing more ""NO (Nitric Oxide)” gas as an intra-cellular weapon against viruses. 
Hexagonal water optimizes the overall energy level in all systems, including the immune system; furthermore, another natural weapon against viruses, H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide), can be easily produced.H2O2 is used by the body to neutralize all kinds of pathogenic agents. Moreover, it has signaling functions for the activation of specific additional immune responses. In deeper tissues, it will be split by the enzyme ""catalase"" into H2O and ""O"" pure oxygen and thereby improves the oxygen supply there.
 Simply put, Diawater is permanent hexagonal deuterium reduced water with extra oxygen that penetrates our cells more effectively and more efficiently serves to ward off bacteria, fungi, and other viruses that thrive in areas that lack oxygen.As a result, your body will be filled with the oxygen-rich hydration that it craves.  How Does Hexagonal Deuterium Reduced Water Support Health?In addition to its contamination-free level of purity, hexagonal water molecules actually contain a higher rate of penetration into human cells, while being able to carry much more oxygen than your typical drinking water.
While we are unable to simply leverage nature’s own process, DiaWater has used technology to mimic the same effects. Our process works to effectively reduce deuterium water molecules in a way that it promotes the stability of these new hexagonal water structures, which positively impact our health in a variety of different ways.
 
With DiaWater, you’re not just drinking water – you’re drinking the purest water on the planet.

   DiaWater is considered hexagonal deuterium reduced water.In other words:
DiaWater is structured, magnetized water.This means that strong magnetic forces have impacted the molecules that make up each drop of water, consequently reducing their size and rearranging its structure into a hexagonal cluster. Now, why is that important?It’s important because hexagonal water molecules are virtually exact copies of water molecules that haven’t been contaminated with some sort of human process. And in today’s world, those molecules are quite difficult to come by.Instead, what you’re left with is the purest man-made water available in the world today – nearly as pure as the water molecules that undergo magnetization right in the heart of Antarctica, just above the Earth’s natural pole.  Thanks to DiaWater, you can reap the benefits of advanced hydration designed to mimic the exact effects that nature’s most coldest environments have on water molecules to bring forth a new type of hydration that protects your body from diseases and other issues. Here at DiaWater, our production process relies on the use of advanced magnetization technology designed to remove hydrogen and deuterium from the water molecules, and substituting these elements with rich and pure oxygen.  The ApproachWe take pure, naturally structured living water and separate the deuterium rich and deuterium poor molecules from one other through an artificial process that mimics the natural processes of evaporation, condensation, and rain.  Under a scientific and precisely calculated process that takes into account time, temperature, pressure, humidity, and room specifications, we heat the contained water to produce water vapors that rise to the top of the space and rain down from above. This process is always ongoing and virtually permanent.  From there, we’re able to acquire an exchange of different water molecule isotopes, which allows us to physically extract the hydrogen atom from each isotope, effectively separating heavy (deuterium rich) and light (deuterium poor) water molecules. From there, we’re able to rearrange the deuterium poor water molecules to ensure that they remain separated from the heavy, hydrogen-rich molecules.This technology is essentially used to imitate the exact same process of magnetization that occurs in places like Antarctica and high mountains where glacial water is found. Under tremendous pressure and unimaginable temperature conditions, this process occurs naturally in the world, leaving the purest, freshest, most oxygen-rich untouched water that the world has ever seen.           At DiaWater, our mission is simple – we’re passionate about promoting the health of every single person who walks this Earth. We understand just how valuable clean, toxin-free, un-contaminated water can be, and how unlikely it is to be found in today’s world.  For that very reason, we continue to create, innovate, and advance our technologies to ensure that we can offer the most pure man-made hexagonal deuterium reduced water available specifically designed to provide each user with advanced hydration that promotes overall health.     For several decades, Arthur has worked, researched, and experimented with the different ways in which the frequencies, energies, and vibrations found in the world around us effect our human cells. His intense rigor has led him to further explore the areas of water revitalization and hydration, and ultimately, DiaWater.Considered an expert on Tesla and Lakhovsky, Arthur continues to research the different components of water, including the concepts of absolute purity, hexagonality, and the production of deuterium poor water.Understanding just how powerful water that contains a low content of heavy hydrogen is, Arthur continues to use advanced technologies to magnetize water and ensure that it remains oxygen-rich and deuterium poor.       1 → What distinguishes DiaWater from other brands?Other brands offer high-quality alkaline water.

This means that our backers can purchase diawater at least 8 weeks before all other, in addition to discounts. 9 → Can I mix DiaWater with my favorite powders to make shakes?Yes, but we recommend the use of DiaWater pure without mixing with external substances in order not to reduce the effect, as we have not conducted any studies on this. 10 → How often should I drink DiaWater?Since DiaWater is not a drug, but pure hexagonal deuterium reduced water, you can drink it as often as you like, we recommend drinking one 1 liter per day!For best results, we recommend the consumption of Diawater as follows:250 ml on an empty stomach after getting up250 ml 30 minutes before lunch250 ml 30 minutes before dinner250 ml before going to bedYou will find that you need less intake compared to your previous options, and that's fine; it's proof of how healthy hexagonal deuterium is reduced water and how the alkaline capacity of DiaWater hydrates your cells faster and at a higher level. 11 → How can I know if I am dehydrated?The interesting thing about dehydration is that when it becomes a normal condition, it can actually be difficult to detect. Only when we experience a highly hydrated state can we really see that we might have been exhausted all along. Some signals may be: Brain mist or lack of concentration, general physical fatigue that lingers, shortness of breath, inconsistent digestion and bowel movements, deep coloration of urine, lack of mental strength, decreased motivation and emotional mood swings. 12 → Where can I buy DiaWater?Right here on our campaigns page with up to 33 % discount and delivery at the end of August. Otherwise online from the end of October at our website. 13 → How can I contact you if I have a question?Our team is ready and willing to contact you. Share your thoughts, feedback or questions on our contact page here.",43.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<br/>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Runatek an early-stage startup working on a tech solution to the opioid crisis. We're developing the Sotiras as a wearable device that can prevent opioid addiction. By actively monitoring opioid levels in patients and administering microdoses as needed, the Sotiras by Runatek will manage pain without an addictive high. The goals of this project are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prevent patients from developing an addiction to prescription opioid pain medication.</li>
<li>Help chronic pain patients to live normal lives.</li>
<li>End the opioid crisis </li>
</ul>
<p>With your help, we can build up our current prototypes and move toward FDA approval, so that this device can get to work saving thousands of lives per year and millions of lives from being toward apart because of an opioid addiction.</p>

<p>Our campaign wants to raise
$7500.00 dollars in 35 days. We anticipate reaching the goal
but in the instance that we reach less than 100% of the goal we will use the
funds raised to move forward with the naming process and further product development.</p>
<p>We will be sending the
Limited Edition Indiegogo Microfiber Air Fresheners with their new Indiegogo
selected name within 30 days following the close of our campaign. Contributors
who support our campaign at the featured level will start receiving the club incentives
in April of 2015. We believe we will exceed our goal so that everyone can enjoy the club level benefits.</p>
<p><b>A limited edition Indiegogo
Microfiber Air Freshener is being designed as a perk for contributors of all
levels in this campaign. The air freshener features our logo a great phrase and
the Indiegogo icon. </b><span></span></p>
<p>The Microfiber Air Freshener
Club uses input from the club members to choose the air freshener artwork,
shapes and colors to be used for the upcoming release. Graphic choices will
include images of dogs, cats, sports and other seasonal themes. The releases
will be based on the times of the year. Such as in January and
February the theme will be winter, Presidents Day or Valentines Day. May and
June will be designated as spring themes. July and August will feature
Independence Day and summer themes.</p>
<p>We have innovated, designed
and patented, several other cleaning products for tablets and technology. We are
really excited about including everyone in the naming process for the
Microfiber Air Freshener. Your input as always is very important to our firm. </p>
<p>When we designed the
Microfiber Air Freshener we were faced with many challenges. Overcoming the
challenges has been the most inspirational part of the journey for the new
product. With your help the Microfiber Air Freshener product line will be a
household item with a short, and poetically memorable name.</p>
<p>Our company is very
inclusive. Part of our plan for naming the air freshener includes gathering as
much input for a name from customers, vendors, and Indiegogo contributors. Selecting
the best name from the vast pool of creative Indiegogo minds can only lead to
success with the product. We are interested in poetic names that may be
humorous, serious, eco-friendly, patriotic, or whatever name comes to mind. So
contribute names and stack the pool with as many names that come to your mind
for a Microfiber Air Freshener. <br/></p>
<p>Cooper Product appreciates

Wouldn't it be cool to know you had a hand in naming the Microfiber Air Freshener?In essence, the selected
names will become household terms seen and used by millions of people on a
daily basis. Cooper Product will fulfill the campaign orders from the USA. In
addition, your contribution will help to create much needed employment. A
California Non-Profit will fulfill orders for our Microfiber Air Fresheners.
Our campaign wants to raise
$7500.00 dollars in 35 days. We anticipate reaching the goal
but in the instance that we reach less than 100% of the goal we will use the
funds raised to move forward with the naming process and further product development.
We will be sending the
Limited Edition Indiegogo Microfiber Air Fresheners with their new Indiegogo
selected name within 30 days following the close of our campaign. Contributors
who support our campaign at the featured level will start receiving the club incentives
in April of 2015. We believe we will exceed our goal so that everyone can enjoy the club level benefits.
A limited edition Indiegogo
Microfiber Air Freshener is being designed as a perk for contributors of all
levels in this campaign. The air freshener features our logo a great phrase and
the Indiegogo icon. 
The Microfiber Air Freshener
Club uses input from the club members to choose the air freshener artwork,
shapes and colors to be used for the upcoming release. Graphic choices will
include images of dogs, cats, sports and other seasonal themes. The releases
will be based on the times of the year. Such as in January and
February the theme will be winter, Presidents Day or Valentines Day. May and
June will be designated as spring themes. July and August will feature
Independence Day and summer themes.
We have innovated, designed
and patented, several other cleaning products for tablets and technology. We are
really excited about including everyone in the naming process for the
Microfiber Air Freshener. Your input as always is very important to our firm. 
When we designed the
Microfiber Air Freshener we were faced with many challenges. Overcoming the
challenges has been the most inspirational part of the journey for the new
product. With your help the Microfiber Air Freshener product line will be a
household item with a short, and poetically memorable name.
Our company is very
inclusive. Part of our plan for naming the air freshener includes gathering as
much input for a name from customers, vendors, and Indiegogo contributors. Selecting
the best name from the vast pool of creative Indiegogo minds can only lead to
success with the product. We are interested in poetic names that may be
humorous, serious, eco-friendly, patriotic, or whatever name comes to mind. So
contribute names and stack the pool with as many names that come to your mind
for a Microfiber Air Freshener. 
Cooper Product appreciates
you visiting our campaign. We want to encourage you, your friends, family, co-workers,
and colleagues to get the word out about our Indiegogo campaign. We are on
Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, Instagram, Linkedin, and most social media cites.

<h3>Optimize your health with this new one-of-a-kind tailored vegetable construction kit made by Fresh Food Paradise.

<h2><b></b></h2>
<p><b></b></p> <p><b>There is a problem which all of us know and which follows us our entire lives!</b> We ask ourselves the same question 365 days a year: <br/></p>
<h4>
<b>What am I going to cook today?</b> <br/>
</h4>
<p>One usually ends up going for dinner, grabbing some fast food or throwing something into the microwave. I know this from personal experience. Even though I am a good cook and I know what is healthy I always have the same problem. <b>To go shopping daily is stressful, takes time and is usually expensive,</b> because you usually end up buying stuff which you do not need or which is unhealthy. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<h4><b>Together we can solve this problem and change the world!</b></h4>
<p>How would you like to have one healthy meal per day delivered to your doorstep or, just pick one up at one of our shops; the preparation of our meals takes less than 15 minutes. <b>No work, no waste, and you don't even have to know how to cook; it is really that simple and healthy at same time</b>, since only natural and fresh ingredients are used. The choice of meals is large enough to experience a different taste every day. <br/></p>
<p></p>

<br/><h4><b>Your help can make our vision reality</b></h4>
It is possible. It just takes a little capital to finance this project, but it is really worth it. With your help, we will reinvent the market for ready meals. <b>Our idea is unique, and has the potential to literally change the world, by ensuring that people become and stay fit and healthy again. </b><br/>What use are the latest technological advances or the modern biotechnologies, if we literally eat ourselves to death? <br/>Two out of three US citizens are already obese; this means over 200 million citizens alone in the USA, whose quality of life is becoming more and more desolate since today's ready meals not only make the consumer fat, but almost addicted to the chemical ingredients and flavor enhancers in these meals. Animal farms use this principle to feed the cattle. Sad but true.<br/>

<p><br/></p>
<p><b>With your help, we will be able to produce meals that are tasty, healthy, and will drastically change the eating habit of the population</b>; without any chemical ingredients! <br/></p>
<p>We use exclusively natural ingredients such as fresh vegetables, fresh fruit, fresh herbs and spices, as well as selected cereals and nuts as sides. <br/></p>

<br/>
<p><b>With your support and our success we will create many attractive and lucrative new jobs in the US</b>, while at the same time tackling the health issue number 1 without the need for extra diets or additional exercise.

<p><br/></p>
<h3>
The impossible is possible - together we can do it</h3>
In order to realize our idea, we need an excellent team,  modern production sites, our own stores, machines, software and of course advertising. According to our calculations, we will need a total of up to $10-20 million to set up this Corporation.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435081690/xoxfczwhkmgegwzaro89.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

Realistically, the first meals will be shipped in the Begin of 2017; in case we make it earlier, we will inform you right away.</b> <br/><br/>Please also note that the exact date of delivery will depend on our available locations. <b>Our initial production site is planned around Ithaca, NY which will allow us to serve a 300 mile radius. </b>If you are not within this, it may be longer.<br/><br/><b></b><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435197467/ihae92pymmkf71afj1r5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>IMPORTANT: Deliveries outside the USA are currently not possible.<br/><br/><br/><br/><h3>Why is the regular price for a single menue $13.5?</h3>
<br/>High quality food, which is produced while taking into account social and environmental factors, is not cheap. For that reason, we will not explore the cheapest way to produce, but rather keep quality and nutritional value, as well as customer satisfaction, as our main objectives. <br/><br/><b>All Meals include at least 0.55 lb to 1 lb of vegetables</b>, meaning that a single meal would satisfy the government's suggestion for a healthy diet.

With your help, we will be able to produce meals that are tasty, healthy, and will drastically change the eating habit of the population; without any chemical ingredients! 
We use exclusively natural ingredients such as fresh vegetables, fresh fruit, fresh herbs and spices, as well as selected cereals and nuts as sides. 
There are such a large variety of vegetables and spices available that we will be able to develop hundreds of large variety of dishes allowing for a different taste experience every day. 




With your support and our success we will create many attractive and lucrative new jobs in the US, while at the same time tackling the health issue number 1 without the need for extra diets or additional exercise. You help fund the project and in return you will receive our products and all of the above-mentioned advantages; you do not have to be vegan or vegetarian since every meal can be used as a healthy side dish for a nice steak as well. 


The impossible is possible - together we can do it
In order to realize our idea, we need an excellent team,  modern production sites, our own stores, machines, software and of course advertising. According to our calculations, we will need a total of up to $10-20 million to set up this Corporation.
We hope that you are just as enthusiastic about our idea as we are and that it will be possible to launch such a campaign in the food market and make it a reality. What is the collected capital used for?Your financial assistance will be used to set up the production. We need an initial capital of $1-$3 million, in order to set up the management, to set up the first smaller production site an into the infrastructure. As soon we need further capital, we will have a good basis to be a get more money for Venture Capitals.Help us to make this dream a reality and enjoy healthy ready meals in return. What do you get for your support?
The best we have to offer. Healthy and tasty ready meals that taste so good that you will definitely want more. We offer discounted packages as perks during this campaign with no additional shipping. But you will have to be patient. Realistically, the first meals will be shipped in the Begin of 2017; in case we make it earlier, we will inform you right away. Please also note that the exact date of delivery will depend on our available locations. Our initial production site is planned around Ithaca, NY which will allow us to serve a 300 mile radius. If you are not within this, it may be longer.IMPORTANT: Deliveries outside the USA are currently not possible.Why is the regular price for a single menue $13.5?
High quality food, which is produced while taking into account social and environmental factors, is not cheap. For that reason, we will not explore the cheapest way to produce, but rather keep quality and nutritional value, as well as customer satisfaction, as our main objectives. All Meals include at least 0.55 lb to 1 lb of vegetables, meaning that a single meal would satisfy the government's suggestion for a healthy diet. Regular 'ready-meals' are usually cereal based because this is cheap and fills the stomach. Real vegetables are very rare in these meals and thus the nutritional value is rather low.All products are made from fresh ingredients and are either shipped directly to the customers house or can be purchased directly at one of our stores. All products are not precooked or frozen, nor do they contain any chemicals. Any parts of the meal that could oxidize will be specially packed in order to ensure that you receive only fresh food.

All ingredients are 100% vegan (with guarantee) and will be from organic and/or controlled production and will be checked regularly. No artificial ingredients will be included. You receive only those ingredients which you would use if you prepared the entire meal by yourself. All components of the meal will be packed individually. The vegetables will be washed, cleaned and prepared for cooking. The pre-cut vegetables will be vacuum packed and, depending on the menu, be packed into one or more separate containers. All spices will be packed into meal-specific mixtures and will be included with the meal. Salt will always be kept separate. Side orders like rice or noodles will also be packed separately and will be included in healthy quantities.After opening the package you can prepare each meal within 15 minutes; even making a pizza takes much longer! All meals taste 100% homemade. Why only vegan ingredients?
If you are vegan or vegetarian, you would not eat meat or fish products, if you are non-vegetarian, you will not have a problem eating a purely vegetarian meal.Our products offer a healthy alternative for vegans, vegetarians and non-vegetarians  which have not been available on the market in this form before.Our healthy, vegan food which can be prepared quickly, will assist obese people in losing weight. Offering solely vegan products is not a limitation but instead an option to really reach everyone. If you are jewish or islamic, you will be pleased to hear that our products will fall within the Kosher and Halal guidelines.Fresh Food Paradise Corporation - experience just how good health can taste...

Road map to helloDOC - 
Dr Varun worked with international SOS in rural Madhya Pradesh and is a national award winner for outstanding performance in the year 2012.Dr Jase believes in a doctor-patient relationship, worked extensively with the National Rural Health Mission in the most rural parts of Kerala.
It was during our stints with primary health care, we decided to stop curing diseases and start preventing diseases by coaching a good life style.
In the year 2013 May, we started our service by house visits, school visits and office visits. We got busy and happy. 


The overwhelming response made us to realise the need of redesigned preventive and holistic lifestyle ecosystem. This made us to think, dream and materialize an integrated holistic lifestyle ecosystem. 
 We started helloDOC ecosystem on January of 2015.
We want helloDOC to be used by all. We want to give a very high quality of service not just for rich, but for all. We wanted helloDOC to be a place where people love to come unlike hospitals.

</div><p><strong>How does the unit works and what are the modes?</strong> </p><div>
</div><ul>
<li>The unit works with three modes and turns off the air conditioning system if there is no movement detected.  The 3 different modes have the following functions:</li>
<li>
<b>Mode 1 - 24 hour detection mode</b> - Detects body movement at all times and emits the ""OFF"" command to turn off the A/C when no body up to pre-set time threshold is detected (timeframes 2, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120 &amp; 140mins).</li>
<li>
<b>M2 - Night Set Mode</b> – Allows the A/C to stay on when the room is dark and there is no movement, i.e. when sleeping. In this mode Waltech uses light sensing technology to allow the A/C to stay on when the room is dark enough.  When the unit detects the room is bright again it will automatically work as M1 mode.</li>
<li>
<b>M3 – Comfort Timer Mode</b> – Allows the air conditioner to be set between certain hours to keep it on or off no matter if there is movement detected. The unit will work as M1 mode out of pre-set time.</li>
</ul><p>
</p><p>Setting up the unit is so easy and should only take 1 – 2 minutes.  The unit comes with an instructional booklet
(which you shouldn’t even need) as well as a quick set-up page.  If you get stuck we even have an
instructional You Tube Video at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XP6usnB6INg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XP6usnB6INg</a></p>

</div></div>","SAVE MONEY AND THE ENVIRONMENT



Switches off your Air Con when nobody is there to use it
Saves you money by not using your power when you don’t need it
 Helps the environment by using less electricity without compromising your quality of life. 
Waltech has a ""learn"" function meaning it can learn the infrared Off signal from any infrared remote control.







How does the unit works and what are the modes? 

The unit works with three modes and turns off the air conditioning system if there is no movement detected.  The 3 different modes have the following functions:

Mode 1 - 24 hour detection mode - Detects body movement at all times and emits the ""OFF"" command to turn off the A/C when no body up to pre-set time threshold is detected (timeframes 2, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120 & 140mins).

M2 - Night Set Mode – Allows the A/C to stay on when the room is dark and there is no movement, i.e. when sleeping. In this mode Waltech uses light sensing technology to allow the A/C to stay on when the room is dark enough.  When the unit detects the room is bright again it will automatically work as M1 mode.

M3 – Comfort Timer Mode – Allows the air conditioner to be set between certain hours to keep it on or off no matter if there is movement detected. The unit will work as M1 mode out of pre-set time.

Setting up the unit is so easy and should only take 1 – 2 minutes.  The unit comes with an instructional booklet
(which you shouldn’t even need) as well as a quick set-up page.  If you get stuck we even have an
instructional You Tube Video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XP6usnB6INg




The Waltech unit is under 13 cm in length and can positioned on a wall out of reach (if necessary) as it is a “set and forget” device.The units sleek design will blend in with any décor.


WALTECH COMPONENTS AND  THE TECHNOLOGY INVOLVED
Waltech main PCB Board


Waltech PIR Unit - Motion Detection sensor


Infra red emitter - to send the off signal to the Airconditioner

All the components that make a Waltech


WHAT COMES IN THE BOX
1 x Waltech unit, 3 x AAA batteries, Mounting bracket with screws and a instruction book.  Please Note that if airfreight is required for delivery some carriers do not allow your box to include the batteries.






What We Have Done So Far

We have had 3 electrical engineers who have designed and developed the Waltech Unit, to our specifications over a 6 month period 
We have tested the prototype and refined the functions over another 6 month period in real environments – including having it installed in homes and having Waltech installed in every room in several complexes of Holiday Apartments



We have competed 2 x production runs so far consisting of a 100
x prototype units that we used for testing in real life environments and a
subsequent production run of 2,500 units to test/ensure the production
processes and quality control. 

Now we are happy with the Waltech Unit and are 100% satisfied that it will do the job it was designed for, we are ready to commercialise it.

</div></div>","The What and The Why  We're organizing four Fitness Fanatics workshops in Houston, New Orleans and Atlanta with your help to spread the positive, life-changing message of fitness and better nutrition in communities with incomes near the poverty line.
I'm the author of Back in the Saddle to Fit: 10 Steps to Reclaiming Athletic Fitness for the Busy Professional, as well as a marketing communications professional, half marathoner and fitness trainer certified by the American Council on Exercise since 2001. The five-hour workshops and training sessions will be based on the principles of the book. 



According to Centers for Disease Control, low-income communities are likely to have higher incidences of obesity, diabetes or undiagnosed diabetes. Unfortunately, accurate fitness and nutrition information often just doesn't trickle down. These communities are also likely to have poorer health outcomes overall, marked by increased stress, pain, worry, sadness and anger, according to information from Gallup and the Brookings Institute.
One hundred fitness enthusiasts – fitness fanatics or F2s – from community centers, churches and
neighborhood associations in low-income areas will be invited to a free, five-hour ""train the trainer"" workshops. After the workshops, F2s will be able to share accurate health, fitness and nutrition information in their communities throughout the year at health fairs, church workshops and other community events. In short, they become the voices of information who help dispel fitness misinformation and nutrition myths.

U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen 


Warns about eco-terrorism using scalar electromagnetic weapons""Others [terrorists] are engaging even in an eco-type of terrorism whereby they can alter the climate, set off earthquakes, volcanoes remotely through the use of electromagnetic waves... So there are plenty of ingenious minds out there that are at work finding ways in which they can wreak terror upon other nations...It's real, and that's the reason why we have to intensify our [counter terrorism] efforts."" - Defense Secretary William Cohen, 1997


















Dr. Walter Russell scientifically recorded Nature’s Cosmological mechanics via Waves . . . and expressed that all elements are transmutating from one vibration to another . . . as wave geometries evolving . . . Gold was the frequency attuned by the Alchemist.    













The modern Science of Cymatics also reveals vibrational geometries as the core signature of atoms and molecules as the building blocks of Nature and matter. Essentially the vibrational-geometry as cause determines the outcome or effect in space and/or time. 















The Ancient Hermetic Caduceus reveals the action of Scalar-Waves . . . as each electromagnetic charge spirals pass the other . . . the “Zero-Point” or the “Scalar"" nexus is accessed. As the two EM wave frequencies cancel each other along the spine of the Human body’s Endocrine Glands as “nodes”, the “Æther-Spirit” enters “Space"" and motion's drag of ""Time”. Thus . . . Scalars reset the Quantum-Wave patterns . . . for the Elements of Life into Balance, neutralizing Radiation and harmful EMFs without interfering with wireless technology, a perfect match!






Take Action now in 2015 for our children's future . . . for our Mother Earth who gives us life needs our care. Contribute to the balance of our footprints and heal our World. Scalar-Wave technology can do exactly this! 





“Ma'atKaRe” is a portable “PHI”- ratio engineered scalarwave inducer harmonizer for an environmental safe-zone free of Radiation, Bio-resonant harmful EMFs and Atmospheric Pollutions exposure. The 7.5” x 7.5” - 16s metric Crystallinite is composed of Rare-Earth Monoatomic Elements; “17"" refined Quartz Minerals; a “gilded-Gold leaf” PHI ratio lattice; 1  “Gold” SP-12 (w/gold N52 magnets) Vortex circuit plate(6M frequencies), all casted in clear resin for a 6 Billion Scalar Frequency modulated protective torus field . . . the Ma’atKaRe protective time reversal field of 6 miles is PHI-TEK.

</div></div>","Short Summary 
You can agree that we are witnessing a growth in the natural hair movement. Natural hair salons and trends have increased exponentially in the last 10 years. Like many women, my natural hair journey has been challenged by the lack of hair products on the market for grooming my locs.  I am Nandi Gilkey, and like Madam C J Walker, I created the natural hair invention of our time.  I am the patent holder of Wrap-A-Loc a hair styling tool -- and a
technique that creates curls, spirals and waves on locked and natural hair.  This amazing tool can be worn undetectable in the hair as a style and when
removed, curls blossom. Wrap-A-Loc uniquely satisfies the need for versatility, flexibility and long-lasting curls. If you are considering rendering your support for this campaign...you too are beautiful and open to finding more healthy ways to accent your natural beauty.   

My beloved husband and business partner, Glenn Gilkey, after working some 14
years in higher education, quit his job to support my vision.,,which is now our vision. Join us in the natural hair product revolution by supporting our campaign and sharing it with your family and friends.  
  What We Need & What You Get
 
Our company is at an aggressive Growth Stage. The recent
rapid growth and popularity of Wrap-A-Loc products nationally and internationally
moves us to expand our operations.  Currently,
there is nothing like the Wrap-A-Loc tool in the marketplace.  This miraculous tool has transformed the way locs
and natural hair is styled. We have a contractual agreement that will assist in
putting the face of our products in retail outlets with major distribution chains
across North America.  We also submitted
proposals to have our products marketed though large suppliers to the Caribbean
and Central America.
    The Impact

With your financial donations and support our goal is to raise $5000, over the next  50 days. Your benevolent contribution will allow us
to:
· 
 Repackage
the product, giving greater appeal to an ever changing and increasing customer
base.
· 
Re-branding of the website for a smoother and
effective purchasing experience.
· 
Satisfy increasing demands for access in local
salons, beauty supply and department stores as well as ethnic shops. 
· 
Expand some administrative operations through partnership
with a fulfillment center.
To thank you for your donation I've created perks that I hope will inspire you to give as much as you can. Peace & Blessings!",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

ambulances need repairs! </h3>
<p>If you have ever had to wait for an ambulance you will know  it's at times like this that
minutes feel like hours, but imagine actually having to wait so long that it is
too late when the ambulance arrives to save a life. People are dying waiting for an
ambulance purely because there are not enough in working order. <br/></p>
<p>Health spending in Greece has been slashed in half in the
last five years. Many ambulances are off the road in desperate need of repairs.
Consequently the remaining ambulances are taking too long to reach an emergency
call out and people are dying waiting for them. Ambulance staff, who have seen
more recent wage cuts, have just suspended a proposed strike as they do not
want to endanger public health. These people despite not having a full wage or
even the tools needed to do their job properly are dedicated to public
healthcare and continue to strive to save lives. In my eyes they are heroes!</p>

The perks include a couple of simple traditional Greek items and a couple of amazing holiday destinations (flights holiday insurance are NOT included but airport transfers and a welcome hamper are).

<h3>Why have I started

<p>I am lucky enough to be able to spend a lot of time in
Greece. I have seen the effects of the Greek crisis first hand and wish to try
to raise funds for specific causes that are in dire need of cash injections

<p>I recently made a donation to Thom Feeney's Greek Bailout
Fund campaign on here. Sadly the campaign did not reach its goal. I did
everything I could to spread the word and encourage donations. It was a tad
ambitious but a great idea anyway. It did, however, get me thinking about the
purpose and what the results would have actually been for the Greeks as
individuals should it have reached its goal. It may well have covered the payment
that Greece has just defaulted on but it would still mean that the Greek people
must carry on living as they are and continue to work towards paying the next
huge installment. I see Thom has now started another campaign to help fund
education in Greece. Investing in the future of the Greek people is an awesome
idea but there are some more pressing and immediate issues that with funding
can be fixed sooner rather than later. People dying whilst waiting for an
ambulance because there aren’t enough in service would be just one of them.</p>

<p>My name is Norman Seavers III. I’m an entrepreneur and consultant focusing my efforts on the area where I’ve gained the most experience: the allograft and tissue implant industry. My experience working in R&amp;D and with researchers across the country has helped me to develop a pipeline of product ideas based on tissue allografts, donated &amp; processed human tissues of various kinds, that can bring innovation to the established allograft market. Our focus is Amnion: the inner lining of the placenta which has tremendous clinical capability! Organ &amp; tissue donation is an extremely generous way that people can help to restore function and enhance the lives of thousands of patients in need. Our goal is to extend the gift of donation by increasing the available therapies derived from allografts, specifically amniotic grafts. Your contribution will help to establish and confirm our R&amp;D efforts, introducing a new line of therapies and the potential for enhanced quality of life for patients with unmet or underserved needs.</p>

<p>Imagine the possibility of taking something normally discarded and transforming it into a life-changing therapy that could benefit thousands. Millions of women have cesarean sections each year as they welcome their new additions to the family. In each case, after the baby is safely removed, the placenta, where the baby grows, develops and is nourished, is discarded by the surgical staff. The special inner lining of the placenta called amnion carries millions of life saving cells and healing factors within its innate function. Through medical advancements over the past several decades a number of companies are using the innate capabilities of amnion to bring cure diseases and ailments including eye diseases &amp; injures, chronic &amp; acute wounds, and improved healing of surgical incisions. </p>
<p>Here’s the short story: potential donor mothers are provided information during their local OB-GYN visits and given the option of donating their placenta if they are having a scheduled c-section. The placenta is removed by the doctor &amp; surgical staff after the safe delivery of the baby. It is normally discarded as medical waste but in this case is able to be utilized to provide a valuable clinical therapy. Qualified &amp; accredited procurement agencies receive the placenta from the surgical staff under sterile conditions and prepare, package and ship the placenta to be utilized in our proprietary process.</p>
<p>One of our initial targets is in Wound Care. The industry is estimated to reach nearly $19 billion in revenue by the year 2019. Our developing pipeline of applications provides allograft therapies (an already established technology) manufactured in unique delivery methods. Our first candidate has a provisional patent and aims to provide a more effective wound irrigation solution related to current  options while avoiding some of the contraindications of available alternatives (esp. toxicity from long-term use). Through our proprietary process, we'll provide a wound irrigation solution that is not only antibacterial but also introduces the wound healing attributes of amnion into negative pressure wound therapy applications. In addition, we are also working on the presentation of a new therapeutic delivery method (candidate #2) for an under-served segment of the industry: inflammatory skin disorders. </p>
<p>Amnion provides anti-inflammatory protection, angiogenesis, and has the potential for the introduction of multipotent cells- all-important characteristics that promote healing in the wound environment. Amnion is natural, readily available, and powerful in its clinical effect. Our plan is to provide documented evidence to demonstrate the success of our process and the value of the innovative therapy. We’ll work with established labs, accredited procurement agencies, and provide full disclosure of our work to all contributors as we make progress.</p>
</div> <div> </div><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>Like all worthy ventures and causes, our campaign is not without challenges. Here are a few challenges that may arise in the process with our plans to address them. </p><ul>
<li>Actual yield per donor: We understand that the placenta is a limited resource and will yield only a certain amount of viable testable material. We've planned with our sources to gain access to additional material as needed so we're able to continue to make progress in the event more initial material is required.  </li>
<li>Determining processing parameters: Our process is novel, meaning we may need to make adjustments quickly based on incoming results. We plan to establish a target range for initial testing parameters based advice from on industry experts and available literature reviews. In addition, we'll make definitive decisions on subsequent trials based on the differences between real data and our targeted outcome.</li>
<li>Chemical compound development: The novelty of one our product candidates is unchartered territory and with it comes the associated risk. We plan to consult chemical composition and pharmaceutical industry experts to determine the most strategic starting point to reach project success.</li>
</ul><p>My career in R&amp;D provided the experience necessary to make adjustments to project parameters in the most effective manner possible. I’ve had the opportunity to build project parameters with clients &amp; researchers from scratch and worked closely with them to adjust as needed whether the required changes determined project success or failure or whether it simply enhanced the project’s efficacy. We will make a definitive roadmap to project success while also developing alternative plans to address risks and challenges to keep us making progress in the right direction. </p> <div> </div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>We realize everyone can't contribute financially, but we appreciate your support. Take the time to spread the word about our campaign and make sure you keep up with the status updates. Let us know how you think we're doing. We value your feedback.</p><p>And if anything is ever unclear related to our projects or processes, don't hesitate to reach out &amp; ask for clarification. We want to keep you in the loop and educated about what we do. We love sharing our story &amp; its impact on our communities. Use the Indiegogo share tools &amp; let people know we're here!</p></div>","Small Business, Big Impact

In this manner we would expect that R&D success will allow for additional follow up funding and phase two development (processing runs, product sizing, packaging requirements, etc).  The Impact
Imagine the possibility of taking something normally discarded and transforming it into a life-changing therapy that could benefit thousands. Millions of women have cesarean sections each year as they welcome their new additions to the family. In each case, after the baby is safely removed, the placenta, where the baby grows, develops and is nourished, is discarded by the surgical staff. The special inner lining of the placenta called amnion carries millions of life saving cells and healing factors within its innate function. Through medical advancements over the past several decades a number of companies are using the innate capabilities of amnion to bring cure diseases and ailments including eye diseases & injures, chronic & acute wounds, and improved healing of surgical incisions. 
Here’s the short story: potential donor mothers are provided information during their local OB-GYN visits and given the option of donating their placenta if they are having a scheduled c-section. The placenta is removed by the doctor & surgical staff after the safe delivery of the baby. It is normally discarded as medical waste but in this case is able to be utilized to provide a valuable clinical therapy. Qualified & accredited procurement agencies receive the placenta from the surgical staff under sterile conditions and prepare, package and ship the placenta to be utilized in our proprietary process.
One of our initial targets is in Wound Care. The industry is estimated to reach nearly $19 billion in revenue by the year 2019. Our developing pipeline of applications provides allograft therapies (an already established technology) manufactured in unique delivery methods. Our first candidate has a provisional patent and aims to provide a more effective wound irrigation solution related to current  options while avoiding some of the contraindications of available alternatives (esp. toxicity from long-term use). Through our proprietary process, we'll provide a wound irrigation solution that is not only antibacterial but also introduces the wound healing attributes of amnion into negative pressure wound therapy applications. In addition, we are also working on the presentation of a new therapeutic delivery method (candidate #2) for an under-served segment of the industry: inflammatory skin disorders. 
Amnion provides anti-inflammatory protection, angiogenesis, and has the potential for the introduction of multipotent cells- all-important characteristics that promote healing in the wound environment. Amnion is natural, readily available, and powerful in its clinical effect. Our plan is to provide documented evidence to demonstrate the success of our process and the value of the innovative therapy. We’ll work with established labs, accredited procurement agencies, and provide full disclosure of our work to all contributors as we make progress.
  Risks & ChallengesLike all worthy ventures and causes, our campaign is not without challenges. Here are a few challenges that may arise in the process with our plans to address them. 
Actual yield per donor: We understand that the placenta is a limited resource and will yield only a certain amount of viable testable material. We've planned with our sources to gain access to additional material as needed so we're able to continue to make progress in the event more initial material is required.  
Determining processing parameters: Our process is novel, meaning we may need to make adjustments quickly based on incoming results. We plan to establish a target range for initial testing parameters based advice from on industry experts and available literature reviews. In addition, we'll make definitive decisions on subsequent trials based on the differences between real data and our targeted outcome.
Chemical compound development: The novelty of one our product candidates is unchartered territory and with it comes the associated risk. We plan to consult chemical composition and pharmaceutical industry experts to determine the most strategic starting point to reach project success.
My career in R&D provided the experience necessary to make adjustments to project parameters in the most effective manner possible. I’ve had the opportunity to build project parameters with clients & researchers from scratch and worked closely with them to adjust as needed whether the required changes determined project success or failure or whether it simply enhanced the project’s efficacy. We will make a definitive roadmap to project success while also developing alternative plans to address risks and challenges to keep us making progress in the right direction.

<p><b>SECRET NUMBER 2 OF REBOOT REVEALED</b></p>
<p>It appears that the big question everyone is asking is - Can you use the phone/tablet whilst they are in their Reboot case and charging?</p>
<p>So here as promised is SECRET 2.</p>
<p><b>Yes you can.</b> We just could not reveal to much information so close to our target launch date.</p>
<p><i>You will also see from this image (deliberately low resolution) we are showing the sim card slot.</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451587826/mlpiv9plzzcbibeqxr13.jpg"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>
<p>So how? well the leather is of course pliable and as you would expect it simply flabs around to the back of the case.</p>
<p>The front Stainless Steel cover is hinged, come on we've all bought into the current trend in laptops, haven't we?</p>
<p>So I guess this might not have been to unexpected, it can be utilised as a stand or totally folded back behind the Reboot device, the leather - which you should now contains small magnets folds over the flap and will keep both of the flaps firmly tucked away; your phone or tablet is still of course secured by the sides of the Reboot case, and it is still docked and still charging whilst you have full access to your devices screen and speakers.</p>
<p><b>ANOTHER SECRET is revealed tomorrow evening. Regards Mike</b></p>
<p>Traffic visiting Reboot on Indiegogo; Last updated about 2 hours ago. 17.51 30th December - <b>18,844 Visits - 17,317  Referrals</b>: with a very small number of pledges; so clearly something is wrong.</p>
<p>I have not shown you the prototypes (pre-production models will be with me on 16th January, so stay tuned).</p>
<p>Plus I have not fully shared the secrets of these first 3 Reboot products.</p>
<p>Why, well there are some <b>trade secrets</b>, and this industry is very prone to copycat products. Even though our products and the Brand is a Trade Mark and the products are protected by Design Rights in the UK, well that does not offer a great feeling of security.</p>
<p>But - here goes - it seems that to get investors ""in"", I need to reveal more about the products features.</p>
<p>So here is <b>SECRET NUMBER 1.</b></p>
<p>Each device contains a removable memory storage capacity of 16GB. How, well that is a secret I can not reveal at this time. Simply be assured that you can back up your phone or tablet on the move, remove the storage to somewhere safe, just in case your phone or tablet is damaged or stolen; your precious memories are back in the safe in your hotel.</p>
<p>I will revel <b>SECRET NUMBER 2</b> on 31st December at 17.00hrs.</p>
<p>Please pledge and help me get these Reboot Devices to market on 1st March 2016 as targeted.</p>
<p>WE <b>NEED</b> your support now.</p>

card holder/flight case/battery pack simply as a power bank with a case for
business cards or is it made for any special type of electronic business card?

<ul>
<ul>
<li><b>The
      case is made to hold all sorts of cards, also electronic ones. They will
      thus be shielded from your phone, so that your credit or even hotel key
      cards cannot be disabled by coming too close to your phone in your pocket
      or bag. This would normally cause damage to the magnet strip in your card
      due to the phone’s radiation.</b></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>What capacity does the battery
have (in mAh) that is contained inside these three devices?</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><b>The
      business card holder has 3500 mAh, the phone case has 4400 mAh and the
      tablet case has 15,000 mAh</b></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>How many input/output connectors
do they have?</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><b>The
      phone and tablet case have an output connector on the inside at the
      bottom of the case where you can plug the device in by sliding it into
      the case. All three devices have an external USB slider. There are no
      other connectors.</b></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>How efficient are they?</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><b>The
      devices have an efficiency of 80%</b></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>If I have a tablet holder/flight
case/battery pack, can I charge my tablet and my phone at the same time by
connecting my phone to the tablet case?</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><b>No,
      because the USB plug is not made to fit your phone’s charge connector.
      But you can recharge your device whilst your battery pack is recharging.
      Simply insert the device and plug your battery pack into any USB outlet.</b></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Are the cases shockproof?</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Yes,
      they are made from stainless steel and are supposed to protect your phone
      from damage when dropped, so this material was selected to guarantee long
      durability of the case despite occasional dropping.</b></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>What accessories are included in
the package? Does it come with an electric plug?</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Thanks
      to this product you don’t need any wires or plugs anymore. The business
      card holder will come with a short cable connector with a length of only
      a few inches. This is essential in order to use the card holder to

into production, and that will happen on the first of March 2016. Built,
finished and ready to deliver to your home.</p>
<p>Cant you buy these in the market
already? - A resounding NO. These are the very first hybrid devices anywhere in
the world, and I designed them to suit my needs, and most likely - YOUR NEEDS.</p>
<p>I will deliver to you very
shortly after this first production date either 1, 2 or 3 of these devices, as
there are 3 devices in the first collection, I feel sure everyone will
want all three, but of course that is your choice. These will be a special
""Indiegogo pledgers"" ""SPECIAL EDITION"" presented in Black
Leather, Chrome Plated Case, with JAGUAR Racing Green Leather Interior (these
will be a one-off SPECIAL LIMITED EDITION, and will never be again be released
in this colour match, so a real collectors item from day one).</p>

</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>We need to raise £150,000, this
is going into producing the first working prototypes, which I will share images
of on the Reboot Digital Technologies web site - <a href=""http://www.rebootdt.com./"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><u>www.rebootdt.com.</u></span></a>
Then ultimately the money raised is to complete the tooling and initial product
runs. </p>
<p>None of the money raised is going
into design of product or packaging as this is already done, The website will
show you these designs and packaging designs in greater detail.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The perks - a small investment is
your choice, you can pledge for just one device, 2 devices or all three devices,
even pledging for all three devices is affordable; Perhaps most
importantly they will certainly cost a lot less than you will pay to a retailer
after we have launched.</p>
<p>What about your pledges and the
funds raised if we don't reach our target? The funds raised will all contribute
to the manufacturing costs, and every contribution will go into the tooling and
production, there will be NO wasted contributions - and we will still hit our
deadline for production. March 1st 2016. Go to the website regularly and watch
the production clock counting down.</p>

</div>","SECRET NUMBER 2 OF REBOOT REVEALED
It appears that the big question everyone is asking is - Can you use the phone/tablet whilst they are in their Reboot case and charging?
So here as promised is SECRET 2.
Yes you can. We just could not reveal to much information so close to our target launch date.
You will also see from this image (deliberately low resolution) we are showing the sim card slot.

So how? well the leather is of course pliable and as you would expect it simply flabs around to the back of the case.
The front Stainless Steel cover is hinged, come on we've all bought into the current trend in laptops, haven't we?
So I guess this might not have been to unexpected, it can be utilised as a stand or totally folded back behind the Reboot device, the leather - which you should now contains small magnets folds over the flap and will keep both of the flaps firmly tucked away; your phone or tablet is still of course secured by the sides of the Reboot case, and it is still docked and still charging whilst you have full access to your devices screen and speakers.
ANOTHER SECRET is revealed tomorrow evening. Regards Mike
Traffic visiting Reboot on Indiegogo; Last updated about 2 hours ago. 17.51 30th December - 18,844 Visits - 17,317  Referrals: with a very small number of pledges; so clearly something is wrong.
I have not shown you the prototypes (pre-production models will be with me on 16th January, so stay tuned).
Plus I have not fully shared the secrets of these first 3 Reboot products.
Why, well there are some trade secrets, and this industry is very prone to copycat products. Even though our products and the Brand is a Trade Mark and the products are protected by Design Rights in the UK, well that does not offer a great feeling of security.
But - here goes - it seems that to get investors ""in"", I need to reveal more about the products features.
So here is SECRET NUMBER 1.
Each device contains a removable memory storage capacity of 16GB. How, well that is a secret I can not reveal at this time. Simply be assured that you can back up your phone or tablet on the move, remove the storage to somewhere safe, just in case your phone or tablet is damaged or stolen; your precious memories are back in the safe in your hotel.
I will revel SECRET NUMBER 2 on 31st December at 17.00hrs.
Please pledge and help me get these Reboot Devices to market on 1st March 2016 as targeted.
WE NEED your support now.
Regards Mike - mikec@rebootdt.com if you have any questions.


                             

 
Last updated about 2 hours ago Campaign Activity
Dated 13.12.2015 - In The last 4 days we have had another 7,000+ visitors to our Indiegogo site; you not many who have a made a pledge and with a total 18,450 visitors and virtually no contributions - that really means that I need to REBOOT my Indiegogo campaign so here we go -
Recharge your device - Reboot your life INEVEST NOW.
From 12.12.15 until the campaign ends - As the founder and inventor of these devices I am releasing 15,000 shares of £10 per share of the 100,000 shares established in REBOOT. Or a total of 15% of the business and brand. The minimum share purchase is 1,000 shares at £10,000.
Reboot Digital Technologies is not just these 3 devices which are for Apple devices.
Most of us carry both Apple and Android devices - correct?
So each of the first 3 devices includes called ""Accelerate"" the connection to charge any other device as well as the Apple device. This female connector allows ALL of the Accelerator products to charge any other device.
Compact torch, E-cigarette, tablet or phone. Never be stuck without power for any device.



The business is forecast to turnover £340,000,000 by 30th December 2020. Net profitability is forecast at 20% PBT. Is this an investment serious investors can afford to miss?
Those with serious intent need to call me or mail ne urgently to register their interest - mikec@rebootdt.com - 07889 362922

PRODUCT Frequently asked
questions


CEO Comments -
Apple compatible at launch date - this device is suitable for all Apple Devices. 2 months from launch date we will be launching visions suitable for all major brands such as Samsung, Lenovo and most other Android powered brands.

Can you describe the business
card holder/flight case/battery pack simply as a power bank with a case for
business cards or is it made for any special type of electronic business card?



The
      case is made to hold all sorts of cards, also electronic ones. They will
      thus be shielded from your phone, so that your credit or even hotel key
      cards cannot be disabled by coming too close to your phone in your pocket
      or bag. This would normally cause damage to the magnet strip in your card
      due to the phone’s radiation.


What capacity does the battery
have (in mAh) that is contained inside these three devices?


The
      business card holder has 3500 mAh, the phone case has 4400 mAh and the
      tablet case has 15,000 mAh


How many input/output connectors
do they have?


The
      phone and tablet case have an output connector on the inside at the
      bottom of the case where you can plug the device in by sliding it into
      the case. All three devices have an external USB slider. There are no
      other connectors.


How efficient are they?


The
      devices have an efficiency of 80%


If I have a tablet holder/flight
case/battery pack, can I charge my tablet and my phone at the same time by
connecting my phone to the tablet case?


No,
      because the USB plug is not made to fit your phone’s charge connector.
      But you can recharge your device whilst your battery pack is recharging.
      Simply insert the device and plug your battery pack into any USB outlet.


Are the cases shockproof?


Yes,
      they are made from stainless steel and are supposed to protect your phone
      from damage when dropped, so this material was selected to guarantee long
      durability of the case despite occasional dropping.


What accessories are included in
the package? Does it come with an electric plug?


Thanks
      to this product you don’t need any wires or plugs anymore. The business
      card holder will come with a short cable connector with a length of only
      a few inches. This is essential in order to use the card holder to
      recharge your phone. One end goes into the USB outlet of the card holder,
      the other into your phone’s charge connector. There will be no other
      accessories.


Reboot Your World

""Life in general and life in
business is a game"", and the best games are always played to win; but
having fun at the same time - 'well that does help'!
As a very seasoned global
traveller that spends a lot of time in hotels, airport lounges - &
trains, planes and automobiles, I need to stay connected. My mobile needs to be
available - all of the time, and my biggest issue is not WiFi connectivity -
NO, its having the power to keep me and my devices connected. I am about to
provide you dear reader with my solution - the ultimate solution!!
Who am I? My name is Michael
Campbell and I am a 53 year old geek, with a real penchant for GADGETS. 



My business, AET Global
Group www.aetglobalgroup.com
is a 24 hour business, we work in every time zone across the globe; and digital
communications are what makes my business work. AS CEO with offices
working globally to keep our customers and our manufacturers right up
to speed; every hour of everyday -  there are no holidays when you are
operating globally - welcome to my world. 

Or realistically - WELCOME TO THE
MODERN DAY WORLD. Communications rule in this world. And staying connected is
now NOT AN OPTION, whether we like it or not.


My Indiegogo
campaign is to provide you with the devices that I have designed to keep your
mobile devices safe from accidental damage, always charged and ready for that
next photo opportunity, or to answer that very important phone call from...well
from anyone. To travel, always CHARGED and READY for any and every opportunity.



So why am I asking for pledges on
Indiegogo? because I want you to be the first customers to own an executive
range of battery pack/flight cases to keep you charged and on the ball at every
opportunity.

I need to go from this design
into production, and that will happen on the first of March 2016. Built,
finished and ready to deliver to your home.
Cant you buy these in the market
already? - A resounding NO. These are the very first hybrid devices anywhere in
the world, and I designed them to suit my needs, and most likely - YOUR NEEDS.
I will deliver to you very
shortly after this first production date either 1, 2 or 3 of these devices, as
there are 3 devices in the first collection, I feel sure everyone will
want all three, but of course that is your choice. These will be a special
""Indiegogo pledgers"" ""SPECIAL EDITION"" presented in Black
Leather, Chrome Plated Case, with JAGUAR Racing Green Leather Interior (these
will be a one-off SPECIAL LIMITED EDITION, and will never be again be released
in this colour match, so a real collectors item from day one).



What We Need & What You Get
We need to raise £150,000, this
is going into producing the first working prototypes, which I will share images
of on the Reboot Digital Technologies web site - www.rebootdt.com.
Then ultimately the money raised is to complete the tooling and initial product
runs. 
None of the money raised is going
into design of product or packaging as this is already done, The website will
show you these designs and packaging designs in greater detail.


The perks - a small investment is
your choice, you can pledge for just one device, 2 devices or all three devices,
even pledging for all three devices is affordable; Perhaps most
importantly they will certainly cost a lot less than you will pay to a retailer
after we have launched.
What about your pledges and the
funds raised if we don't reach our target? The funds raised will all contribute
to the manufacturing costs, and every contribution will go into the tooling and
production, there will be NO wasted contributions - and we will still hit our
deadline for production. March 1st 2016. Go to the website regularly and watch
the production clock counting down.


The Impact

Reboot Digital Technologies is a
game changing business with game changing products designed to take the pain
out of staying connected and staying in touch - and staying SAFE. I never want my
daughter out at night without her phone fully charged so she can call a cab, or
call her mum, or call the emergency services if her car breaks down - I think
everyone sympathises with my message here.

how do I prove my credentials?
You wont know this - however! when you are next taking a shower that is
thermostatically controlled for safe scald-free showering; look closer, YES, I
designed it. And one of my factories/partners likely sold it to the home
builder or the hotel where you are about to take that shower.


Risks & Challenges
 
There are no risks
investing with Reboot devices. We will deliver the products. They will make
your life easier and safer by keeping you connected - ALWAYS.

There have been some design
challenges, we have incorporated cable and plug free recharging and that's new
technology! But the risks are already designed out - so we know our devices
work, and that's a great start. We just want our customers to experience a
great product that is easy to use and a joy to engage with - think
Apple!!


Other Ways You Can Help
What do we want - we want you -
yes you - Indiegogo supporters, to be the first to RECHARGE YOUR DEVICES - TO
RECHARGE YOUR WORLD. If you can’t invest - then just tag all your contacts -
tell them and excite them - that's all we ask

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>This story is not a story about OncoStem Biotherapeutics. Ultimately, It is about those who have had to contend with this dreadful disease.</p>
<p>Let me paraphrase Kubler Ross: The most precious people I have known are those who have known defeat from this disease, who have known struggle, who have known loss, and yet still somehow found their way out of the devastating cost we pay when dealing with cancer.</p>
<p>Like many of us, you have already shown your concern about this dreadful disease. OncoStem Biotherapeutics has launched its crowdfunding campaign for the development of a potentially revolutionary cancer treatment taken by mouth. </p>
<p>     OncoStem Biotherapeutics, a novel, small startup, cancer drug development Biotech Company, needs your help. It is reaching out to the public to seek the initial funding needed to change, the way we treat cancer. OncoStem Biotherapeutics is not part of the bureaucratic, high-priced, pharmaceutical giants that continue to produce expensive, toxic drugs that have not produced any significant cure for cancer. If there is any David among the giants, it is us.</p>
<p>     OncoStem has proposed a whole new approach to cancer treatment. Because paradigm-changing ideas are rarely accepted, OncoStem Biotherapeutics has decided to seek the initial financial support it needs from those who know this disease far too well. Help us let the world know that there is a better way to treat, and potentially cure, this horrendous disease. OncoStem will have a memorable gift for you for your support. Even if you decide to not join us in this important effort, please tell as many as you can about OncoStem and what it is trying to achieve. Let's continue the effort to finally cure cancer.</p>
<p>It is time to take a more logical, rational, but scientific approach in the treatment of cancer. We cannot cure a disease that we have not understood - until now. OncoStem Biotherapeutics has applied Bioinformatics to Systems Biology, Genomics, and Network Theory to identify a group of unique genetic biomarkers critical to cancer growth and metastasis, and specific for any individual’s unique cancer. It possesses a proprietary database of such markers. The protein products of these cancer biomarkers are already commercially available for the establishment of inhibitory assays for the immediate identification of drug Hits and subsequent drug Hit Leads for the development of a whole new class of oral, targeted anti-cancer drugs.</p>
<p>You may visit us at <a href=""http://www.oncostembio.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.oncostembio.com</a></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>The cost of current cancer drugs is astronomical and untenable. This is not a reflection of the true costs to make such drugs, but a result of the massive, and expensive support systems big pharmaceutical companies have in place to achieve their goals. Remarkable, more effective, cancer drugs are more efficiently developed by small drug development companies, like OncoStem Biotherapeutics. We are seeking funding support for the cost of access to the chemical libraries to screen the pre-drug candidates that will turn off the master cancer genes that caused your specific cancer. If we reach at least 50% of our goal, we will still be able to identify at least one potential cancer drug during the screening process. The number of potential cancer drugs isolated will increase as we approach our goal and exceed it.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>President Nixon's war on cancer effort has been a failure. Part of the problem has been the “lemming” effect in the discovery of new biomarkers, and drugs, as a result of Pharmaceutical companies' leeriness to pursue more effective drug targets. Large pharmaceutical companies continue to produce copies of the same kinds of drugs. Few of these expensive, toxic drugs are curable. We are in dire need of the right biomarkers useful for the development of specific targeted anti-cancer drugs that inhibit the master cancer genes that your cancer is dependent upon for its survival and growth.

This story is not a story about OncoStem Biotherapeutics. Ultimately, It is about those who have had to contend with this dreadful disease.
Let me paraphrase Kubler Ross: The most precious people I have known are those who have known defeat from this disease, who have known struggle, who have known loss, and yet still somehow found their way out of the devastating cost we pay when dealing with cancer.
Like many of us, you have already shown your concern about this dreadful disease. OncoStem Biotherapeutics has launched its crowdfunding campaign for the development of a potentially revolutionary cancer treatment taken by mouth. 
     OncoStem Biotherapeutics, a novel, small startup, cancer drug development Biotech Company, needs your help. It is reaching out to the public to seek the initial funding needed to change, the way we treat cancer. OncoStem Biotherapeutics is not part of the bureaucratic, high-priced, pharmaceutical giants that continue to produce expensive, toxic drugs that have not produced any significant cure for cancer. If there is any David among the giants, it is us.
     OncoStem has proposed a whole new approach to cancer treatment. Because paradigm-changing ideas are rarely accepted, OncoStem Biotherapeutics has decided to seek the initial financial support it needs from those who know this disease far too well. Help us let the world know that there is a better way to treat, and potentially cure, this horrendous disease. OncoStem will have a memorable gift for you for your support. Even if you decide to not join us in this important effort, please tell as many as you can about OncoStem and what it is trying to achieve. Let's continue the effort to finally cure cancer.
It is time to take a more logical, rational, but scientific approach in the treatment of cancer. We cannot cure a disease that we have not understood - until now. OncoStem Biotherapeutics has applied Bioinformatics to Systems Biology, Genomics, and Network Theory to identify a group of unique genetic biomarkers critical to cancer growth and metastasis, and specific for any individual’s unique cancer. It possesses a proprietary database of such markers. The protein products of these cancer biomarkers are already commercially available for the establishment of inhibitory assays for the immediate identification of drug Hits and subsequent drug Hit Leads for the development of a whole new class of oral, targeted anti-cancer drugs.

What We Need 
The cost of current cancer drugs is astronomical and untenable. This is not a reflection of the true costs to make such drugs, but a result of the massive, and expensive support systems big pharmaceutical companies have in place to achieve their goals. Remarkable, more effective, cancer drugs are more efficiently developed by small drug development companies, like OncoStem Biotherapeutics. We are seeking funding support for the cost of access to the chemical libraries to screen the pre-drug candidates that will turn off the master cancer genes that caused your specific cancer. If we reach at least 50% of our goal, we will still be able to identify at least one potential cancer drug during the screening process. The number of potential cancer drugs isolated will increase as we approach our goal and exceed it.
 

The Impact
President Nixon's war on cancer effort has been a failure. Part of the problem has been the “lemming” effect in the discovery of new biomarkers, and drugs, as a result of Pharmaceutical companies' leeriness to pursue more effective drug targets. Large pharmaceutical companies continue to produce copies of the same kinds of drugs. Few of these expensive, toxic drugs are curable. We are in dire need of the right biomarkers useful for the development of specific targeted anti-cancer drugs that inhibit the master cancer genes that your cancer is dependent upon for its survival and growth. We believe we have identified those kind of master cancer genes.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Steven and Jessica's active lifestyles and passion for adventure gave birth to their business <i>Roll and Go. </i>Together, they're setting out to make the world a better place by encouraging people to loosen their muscles, go for walks, enjoy the outdoors, and stay healthy.</p>
<p>When they make their rollers, they like to keep a few things in mind:</p>
<p><strong>Usability</strong> - they want to make sure that their devices can be used to massage as much of the body as possible; and if one type of roller can't reach, then another will.</p>
<p><strong>Portability</strong> - This is second only to customer satisfaction, and is the company namesake. The rollers are specifically designed to be moved around with ease, as opposed to traditional massage roller sticks which are difficult to stick in a bag or backpack. Future models will include larger foam rollers and other designs for effective massaging.</p>
<p><strong>Modularity</strong> - The rollers are designed to be completely customizable. Everything between color, size, and strength is meant to be curated just for you.</p>
<p><strong>Cost Effectiveness</strong> - Steven and Jessica are truly passionate about seeing the world improve, so they wish to keep their products as inexpensive as possible, especially under $20 if possible.</p>
<p><strong>Environmental Impact</strong> - Their rollers use PLA plastic, common for 3D printers. This plastic is derived from corn rather than oil, so the rollers are low carbon footprint. Future designs may incorporate up-cycling and wood.</p>
<p><strong>Durability</strong> - The rollers are designed to be strong against any impact, especially since they are meant to live in an athlete's bag!</p>
<p><strong>Customer Satisfaction</strong> - Still not enough? Steven and Jessica are only a click away if you have any comments, questions, or suggestions. They want to be involved so that you can be as pleased as possible with your roller, your body, and thus your life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>None of this will be possible, however, without your generous support. Unfortunately, plastic injection is expensive, and without you, we won't have anything to achieve these goals with.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need your help to fund the production of our rollers. This is a one-time thing where the creation of the molds happens (which is the super expensive part). All of your funds will be going to that and becoming an effective member of the masseuse community, this will be just under $15000.</p>
<p>Items for you:</p>
<p>Funds of at least $30 will get you 2 massage rollers, fully customizable as shown in the video.</p>
<p>Funds of at least $60 will get you codes for 2 free rollers of any model, available any time in the future.</p>
<p>Just want to donate? That's fine too!</p>
<p>If our goal isn't met, we're going to give everything we have to the mold making, and once it's completed, you will still receive what you bargained for.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With our rollers and involvement in the athletic community, we hope to bring cost-effective environmentally friendly massage therapy items that anyone can use. Because of this mantra, we believe that we can help improve the global, body, and mental health everywhere.</p>
<p>Since we started this business in November 2016, we have found few obstacles that we could not overcome. While this is our first business venture, we're very apt at learning so no matter the challenges that come our way, we can adapt and use them to our advantage; everything is a learning experience.</p>
<p>We exist to help people, so we keep that in the forefront of our minds when conducting all of our business.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, we face very few challenges due to the fact that this market is fairly untapped; this of course means that there will be more risk because it is also an untested market. However, after some preliminary research, there seems to be a fairly high demand for our products, so even that risk is mitigated.</p>
<p>Risks from the product are small because it has been tested quite thoroughly for months before arriving at the current design. The product in question, known as the Flex Roller, is also patented, thus securing our spot in the industry.</p>
<p>The only foreseeable challenges that remain are marketing and packaging the products, as well as designing and testing different types. We are easily able to overcome these because we know where we stand as a company, and we have the creativity to improve that standing. We will do as we always do to persevere: research the problem, create a number of solutions, pick the best one, make it better, and move on.</p>

What is Raw Strength Nutrition?

What you consume becomes who you are. This fundamental truth, is our foundation at Raw Strength Nutrition. You try your hardest to eat healthy. You give 100% in the gym. Heck, you even go and do YOGA! But when it comes to Supplements, there is really no good option. You either have to choose between some flashy labeled supplement, with chemicals in it you cant even pronounce. Or you jump over to the discount isle and where you chose the cheapest one possible. We believe at Raw Strength Nutrition that supplementing your diet is a crucial aspect in becoming the best possible version of yourself. Which is why we set out on a mission to find and bring you the best possible Supplement Brand. One without artificial colors, and flavors. Without fillers and additives. Not put into Containers riddled with BPA's and other Plastic Bi-products. One that was Organic and that you could trace back to the Source. Out of that Journey, Raw strength Nutrition was born. We don't hide behind flashy labels. We don't mark our products up simply because they are Healthy.We sell supplements that are, what they say they are.

Where do the Funds Go?The funding will allow us to finally get an official warehouse and office space. We have been currently in a very small office, in our Alma mater. With your help we will move to an official office/warehouse and be able to operate more freely. 

Your funding will also help us expand out to other types of organic products. One of our sticking points is that we never want to have anything on credit. Call us old school, but all of the business expenses have been completely funded by us.  At Raw Strength Nutrition we understand that even though this forces the company to start off small, it gives us the freedom to not have to worry about making and pushing customers to purchase products. We know the products that we offer are the top of the line, and we  believes that you the customer should be allowed the decision to purchase our product. With your decisions to fund and purchase our products, we can offer you the customer, an ever growing variety of different organic supplements.

RSN Organic Psyllium Husk 




Our Organic Psyllium Husk is rich in dietary fiber, has been traditionally used to help support a healthy digestive tract. Fiber is deficient in the diets of most Americans due to frequent consumption of over-processed foods that are stripped of their natural fiber content. Short-term inadequate fiber intake can cause stomach discomfort related 
to constipation, and over time this can lead to more serious 
complications in the intestine like diverticulosis & diverticulitis,
 causing unwanted pain and discomfort. The recommended fiber intake for the general population is 25-35 grams per day for optimal intestinal health. 

Psyllium husk provides an excellent source of both soluble and insoluble fiber, which can help promote proper digestion as well as support healthy cholesterol levels in the body.Serving Size: 4.6gAmount of Fiber Per Scoop: 4gIngredients: Organic Whole Psyllium HuskHealth Certifications: 1.

<h2>Introducing Curi™</h2>
<p>Everyone has family. Whether they are blood relatives, life partners, or close friends, you have their back and they have yours. Families care for each other...that's what they do.</p>
<p>Why you care is simple. Caregiving—for a chronically ill child, a disabled friend, an elderly parent—often isn't. When you have to juggle caring for multiple people, sharing care responsibilities, and caring for yourself...and you still have to work for a living...life can be complicated and hectic.</p>
<p> At Semafores we understand the challenges today’s family caregivers face because we’re caregivers ourselves. Our founder, Julie Tittler, had the idea for Curi™, our mobile social family caregivers’ assistant, when she was faced with her own caregiving challenges. Julie tells her story in our video above.</p>
<p>Curi™ simplifies family caregiving and gives caregivers peace of mind. Curi™ helps caregivers:</p>
<p>●     refocus caregiving into clear concrete goals for each family member</p>
<p>●     hand care off between caregivers effortlessly, so the right<br/>        person is notified to do the right thing at the right time</p>
<p>●     back each other up when things don’t or can’t happen</p>
<p>●     know everyone’s status at a glance, up-to-the-minute,<br/>        even when you are miles away</p>
<p>●     pull together their collective caregiving know-how into a<br/>        shared multimedia library</p>
<p>●     keep everyone encouraged and engaged with their care</p>
<p>●     foster and maintain independence in the young and the<br/>       old while maintaining discreet caregiver supervision</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Why We Need Your Help</strong></h3>
<p>Creating the tools to make complicated family caregiving simple is a labor of love. It has taken much time and a lot of our own money. It’s also taken a lot of team work with families like yours. We are almost there, almost ready to put it into families’ hands. We just need to cover a few more things before we can do that: insurance, devices for testing, and tools to get our customer support in place. Join our tribe. Become part of the Semafores team and help us cross the finish line.</p>
<h3><strong>How You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>You can contribute as much, or as little, as you like. Crowdfunding is a grassroots effort to get us off the ground. In return, we can send you some nice perks—subscriptions to Curi™, an invitation to a private beta test, some promotional merchandise. Even if you don’t need Curi™ yourself, you probably know someone who could really use it. You are free to give any license you may receive to someone you know. If you want, we’ll donate it to a family in need--just let us know. Or, if you like, you can make a donation without accepting any perks. Spread the word about Curi™. Tweet it. Share it. Text it.

<h2>Our Story</h2> One of our co-founders, has a cousin who was diagnosed with epilepsy a year ago. This cousin's aunt, her primary caregiver, had no way of figuring out when she was having a seizure in her sleep without popping in to inspect the sleeping girl every now and then to ensure that all was well. This is a huge cause for concern considering the fact that sudden unexpected death of someone with epilepsy or SUDEP occurs most often when the patient has a seizure while he or she is sleeping.That's when we came up with the idea of creating an alert system that can notify caregivers in case of emergency while the patient is sleeping, and an assurance that their loved one is safe.</div><div>

<p>According to the <a href=""http://www.epilepsy.com/learn/epilepsy-101/what-epilepsy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Epilepsy Foundation</a>, epilepsy is the fourth most common neurological disorder. It is estimated that 3 - 5% of the population have a seizure sometime in their life and 0.5 -1% have ‘active epilepsy’. More people die from epileptic seizures every year than in a house fire.

<p><span>Epilepsy has no known cure. Several forms of medication exist that allow the patient to control the symptoms and live with the condition.

So the fact remains that no matter what the mitigating treatment being used is, some form of monitoring is necessary to ensure safety of the patient.Several seizure alert devices are already on the market today. However, the non-invasive ones primarily use abnormal movement as the criteria to detect seizures. Breathing and heart rate are important markers when it comes to SUDEP.

The Problem


According to the Epilepsy Foundation, epilepsy is the fourth most common neurological disorder. It is estimated that 3 - 5% of the population have a seizure sometime in their life and 0.5 -1% have ‘active epilepsy’. More people die from epileptic seizures every year than in a house fire. SUDEP in particular is a cause for serious concern.

1,00,000 people die annually due to SUDEP
More than 1 in 1000 people worldwide suffering from epilepsy die in their sleep every year
SUDEP accounts for 34% of all sudden deaths in children

Why we are the best solution 
 
Epilepsy has no known cure. Several forms of medication exist that allow the patient to control the symptoms and live with the condition. However, there are some for whom anti-epileptic drugs(AEDs) do not necessarily work and may have to resort to other methods such as ketogenic diets, VNS therapy, DBS therapy, and even brain surgery if it is found that the cause for epilepsy can be found in one specific part of the brain.

How Does It Work

This is markedly important for patients diagnosed with epilepsy as there is no additional reminder that they have a condition that requires monitoring, considering the stigma that the disease carries. Our solution measures respiration rates and motion patterns from a distance to detect seizures through irregularities in vital statistics. Once detected, caregivers are notified via an app on their smartphones so that they can take immediate mitigating action. This also allows patient data such as the severity and frequency of the attacks to be collected since this information is necessary for the consulting neurologists/doctors to devise appropriate treatment.  iCare does all this at a very affordable price.
Our wall monitor has five major components:

Presence Detection: Detects a person’s presence in the room
Respiration Profile: Continuous streaming and analysis of respiration rate
Motion Profile: Continuous streaming and analysis of motion profile 
Artificial Intelligence Component: Analyse, process, and assimilate data to create an early stage alert mechanism

Mobile application: Using wi-fi/bluetooth/mobile network, the data is continuously streamed to the caregiver’s smartphone. When there is any change in the respiration rate or the motion profile, an alert is sent to the caregiver.        



 Why We Need You 
We have a great product and we know it. What we need now is the money to get this product from the prototype stage to the market. Help us reach our goal and bring us one step closer to making the lives of millions of people worldwide safer.

                              FAQ
What happens when there is more than one person in the room?
The system collects data from both people and develops a respiration profile over time.  The AI algorithm will pick this up and send out alerts when there is a disruption in either one of them.
What happens if the system fails?
In the exceptional case that the system experiences software and/or mechanical failure, an alert goes out to the primary caregiver who can then get in touch with our customer care to solve the issue in a timely fashion.

What happens if there’s an electrical failure?
The device has  built-in battery backup that will last for about 4 hours.
How do you deal with the issue of data privacy?
We understand how important data privacy is to our users. Our system is built on a secure platform and encrypted with up-to-date tools to ensure that the information stored therein is not misused.
 
 
Risk And Challenges
We have a long road ahead of us and the challenges will be plenty. From manufacturing schedules or clinical trials, we’re bound to face hurdles we’re prepared for and ones we aren’t. In terms of limitations the the  iCare solution is not built to be used to collect data for more than three persons in the same room.  While this is out of our current scope, it is definitely something we need to look into in the future.

</h3> <p>Dr.Sanango was established by Shaman Don Eluco Navarro and his English apprentice Emily Sinclair in May 2015. Our vision was to create a centre of positive cross-cultural exchange, providing authentic shamanic healing with Master Plants Ayahuasca and Sanango. We aim to preserve, share, and develop shamanic knowledge through our interaction with the international community, whilst working with and serving the local community. For the last year we have been growing organically without outside investment. In order to realise our vision of moving further in to the rain-forest this coming year, the time has come to seek the help of the wider 'familia de la medicina'... </p>

Our Story
 Dr.Sanango was established by Shaman Don Eluco Navarro and his English apprentice Emily Sinclair in May 2015. Our vision was to create a centre of positive cross-cultural exchange, providing authentic shamanic healing with Master Plants Ayahuasca and Sanango. We aim to preserve, share, and develop shamanic knowledge through our interaction with the international community, whilst working with and serving the local community. For the last year we have been growing organically without outside investment. In order to realise our vision of moving further in to the rain-forest this coming year, the time has come to seek the help of the wider 'familia de la medicina'... 

We currently facilitate ayahuasca healing retreats and shamanic dietas at Chinchelejo Lodge (Dragonfly Lodge), the family home of indigenous Ayahuascero Don Eluco Navarro, in his Amazonian village of Jenaro Herrera. Chinchelejo Lodge was first established as a healing centre in 2008 by Eluco and his partner at the time, Meghan Shannon. They lived and worked together until 2011 after which Eluco worked in other centres near Iquitos. It was at one of these centres that he met Emily, an English Anthropologist and travelling volunteer at the time and together they re-opened Chinchelejo Lodge for healing retreats. 
This Campaign

Dr.Sanango has enjoyed a wonderful first year in which we have helped many amazing people from around the world, welcoming them in to our 'familia de la medicina'. In order to better serve them and future visitors we would like to move deeper in to the rain-forest away from the sounds of the village, which are sometimes distracting for our guests. Chinchelejo Lodge has served Don Eluco and the medicine community connected to him well for many years, but over this time the village has expanded moving closer to the lodge, whilst electricity has made outside noise louder. Chinchelejo Lodge will continue to be a big part of Dr. Sanango giving guests a taste of Amazonian village life. However, we will gradually grow out in the forest where our visitors can experience greater tranquility in nature. A friend of the centre who first visited last year has generously bought and donated land for this purpose. 
First, we want to build a maloca (ceremony house) , which we are hoping to fund with this campaign. This will enable our guests to enjoy ayahuasca ceremonies in the forest in the safety and beauty of this traditional sacred structure. We estimate it will cost $2000, including labour, to build. 
Alongside the maloca we need to construct a simple communal house, which can be used for meditation and relaxation before and during the day after ceremonies. We estimate this will cost $1000. 
To improve accommodation and provide more space for guests at the camp, we would like to renovate a large guest house that was gifted to us by Don Alberto. The house needs a new roof, work inside and decoration. We estimate this will cost $1000. 
Thus, with your help we are campaigning to raise $4000 for this project. 

Future Plans

Later, we  plan to build tambos (individual wooden huts) for plant dietas, to provide a quiet haven for people undergoing this deep personal healing experience. 
In time, we will build retreat guest houses and a kitchen space in the forest. 
We have begun planting ayahuasca vine on the land in order to provide a sustainable source for the centre, and will plant chakruna and other medicinal plants as we continue, creating an abundant medicinal garden in the centre grounds. We also envisage a vegetable patch and eco toilets so the space will gradually grow in to a sustainable medicinal community.

NOSADE - Yoga in Morocco


NOSADE was founded in 2014 by Anica Herrmann to share very authentic, high-quality and familiar travel experiences with like-minded, nomad-hearted people in beautiful, ever fascinating Morocco.

NOSADE is successfully running group yoga retreats as well as individual yoga trips in Marrakech, the Sahara Desert and at Morocco's coastlines - currently three varying retreats per month.

The most retreats we are running in our beloved home base Marrakech that has developed more and more to a hot spot for a variety of travelers. Here we are starting all our trips from and welcome our guests from all over the world.

Green fascinating Marrakech

Ever since Anica started NOSADE, she was driven and always highly inspired by Morocco's cultural variety and its natural diversity. By its hospitality and the surprises it holds on a day-to-day basis in a most positive and challenging way. 

Marrakech stands for exactly these fascinating characteristics. And Marrakech stands for its green havens: its gardens.

""Ever since I m living Morocco these gardens
fascinated, inspired, calmed me within the hustle and bustle of the city. Ever since I dreamed about a garden in
Marrakech! As a haven in the middle of the city! A garden as a space and meeting place for fellow yogis living or
traveling here"", Anica says.

This way we will cover as many affected as possible. Other Ways You Can HelpYou can help many ways, with money, sharing, telling friends and don´t forget to use the share tool of indigogo.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>We Want to Help More Women<br/>
</h3>It's time to turn the page on <b>Buff</b><i>Camp</i> and build something bigger that allows us to help more women... many more women! Both locally and worldwide!<br/><b>  <i>Programs For Everyone</i></b><i>:</i>  We want to build a bigger gym. The goal is to serve every segment of the female population - from the young female athlete to the grandmother looking to improve her balance. The additional space takes the restrictions off what we can do. It will allow us to help many more groups of women and hold multiple classes at one time. It will also make filming the workouts for online access much easier.<br/><b>  <i>Fat Loss:</i></b>  In  a small space we can't show the many different exercise combinations, or the different types of equipment that can be used to achieve fat loss. This is <b>very important</b> because we want to show women that they can achieve results regardless of the equipment they have access to ...or their limitations (<i>Ex.</i> someone who can't run because of ankle pain). Too many women think they ""must run"", ""lift heavy"" or  do a lot of cardio to lose body fat... this is simply not true! We will blow this myth out of the water!<br/>  <i><b>Online Access:</b></i>  The Fat Loss workouts will be available online so that any woman with access to a computer or cell phone can follow along.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463960780/new_womens_gym_in_buffalo_qji81y.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<li>These are two programs that we are very excited about, our <b>Senior Fit</b> program and our <b>Excell</b> program. These are two groups of women who are largely neglected in gyms everywhere. Unless you belong to a YMCA, you've probably never seen a class for seniors that focus on their needs specifically... Actually you've probably never seen any sort of class for seniors! Seniors realize how important <b>Balance, Functional/Life Movements</b> and <b>Bone - Strengthening</b> activities are... and that's what we will focus on.</li>
<li>The <b>Excell</b> program is so badly needed. many more young female athletes are participating in sports than ever before. many of these athletes have a chance to get College scholarships. We have coaches that work specifically with theses athletes. Being 
involved with boys athletics (I have two sons), I realize that there is a
 huge void in programs that are geared toward helping female athletes 
improve in their particular sport, eat correctly and maintain a positive
 self-image. <br/>

<p><b>ReSpin</b> is one of several several programs that use the <b>AfterBurn 50</b> program to burn fat faster and in a shorter amount of time: <i>Resistance exercises are used to increase your heart rate...</i> the cardio exercises/machines are used to maintain a lower heart rate in between the resistance cycles. This combination gives you faster fat loss and it preserves muscle so that your body looks fit and tone as you lose weight.</p>

<b><b>Anyone Can Take The Fat Loss classes</b>. </b>Don't think you 
have to be some super athlete or in great shape to participate in the 
Fat Loss classes. Anyone can get the same results as long as you follow 
the correct format. Maybe you can't run on a 
treadmill because of a nagging injury, or maybe you just don't like 
running. No problem, you can use a spin bike or an elliptical to achieve
 the same results.These fat loss workouts allow you to do that. It doesn't matter
 because there are many ways to achieve your goals as long as you follow the core principles.....

</div><p><b>FRUSTRATION:</b></p><div>
</div><p>About 10 years ago, While working in big box gyms as an independent trainer. I became frustrated for two reasons. <br/></p><div>
</div><ol>
</ol><div>
</div><ol>
<li>Women, who were starting to come to gyms much more than ever before, were often not taken serious by trainers. The were often given programs designed for men. Very few got results and many times, women who came to the gym to lose weight were getting bigger!</li>
<li>The fat loss industry started to explode with bogus weight loss cures such as ""miracle"" diet pills, or exercise machines that could ""melt"" fat. These were all 100% ineffective solutions designed to take money from women who were desperate to get results </li>
</ol><div>
</div><ul>
<li>fat loss body wraps</li>
<li>shake and juice diets<br/>
</li>
<li>lasers that burn fat</li>
<li>cleanses</li>
<li>Infomercials: exercise machines making unbelievable claims</li>
<li>""miracle"" fat loss pills</li>
<li>infomercials: workout programs that only required 10-15 min a day to ""melt fat away""</li>
<li>every week there was a new ""<b>secret</b>"" ""<b>rare</b>"" or ""<b>miracle</b>"" Berry or Fruit from some far off country that <i>""holds the secret to fat loss""</i>
</li>
</ul><div>
<b>This is Basically How It WAS and STILL Is Today:</b> Like buying a car from a slimy used car salesman<br/>
</div><p>  </p> <div> <h3>What We Need <br/>
</h3> <p>The Goal is $20,000. This is the minimum that will allow us to set the gym up with the proper equipment. <b>It's really important to understand that maximum results CAN be achieved with ""regular"" equipment that's found in any gym</b>. We need a few specialized pieces of equipment (<i>balance training, core training, sports training</i>) - but we will never use 'gimmicky' or 'fad' equipment. <br/></p>
<p><b>What If I Don't Have A Gym Membership?</b> Doesn't matter, we will show you how to perform these workouts at home with just some dumbbells (online access).<br/></p>

<br/>
<ul> <li>
<b>A gym like this need a variety of exercise machines</b>. Rowers, ellipticals, treadmills, sleds, spin bikes, punching bags. Variety is a major component in women's fat loss. Another key component is resistance equipment: dumbbells, barbells and specialized/functional machines. Specialized equipment is important, for example, a <b>hex bar</b> allows women to train their legs with squats without having to put a heavy bar on their back. The goal is to have equipment that is adaptable to EVERYONE.</li>

Gyms don't make women a priority! Gyms are built for men. There is 
no gym that caters to women... NONE! Big gyms run a few group/bootcamp 
classes, maybe a few spin classes, a few times a week.
 They offer just enough to appease the women, who make up HALF of their 
 memberships!!   












We use the same training principles whether you want to lose 10 lbs or 100 lbs... whether you want to lose your baby weight or go into competition. You can achieve whatever you want as long as you follow the proper principles.



We Want to Help More Women
It's time to turn the page on BuffCamp and build something bigger that allows us to help more women... many more women! Both locally and worldwide!  Programs For Everyone:  We want to build a bigger gym. The goal is to serve every segment of the female population - from the young female athlete to the grandmother looking to improve her balance. The additional space takes the restrictions off what we can do. It will allow us to help many more groups of women and hold multiple classes at one time. It will also make filming the workouts for online access much easier.  Fat Loss:  In  a small space we can't show the many different exercise combinations, or the different types of equipment that can be used to achieve fat loss. This is very important because we want to show women that they can achieve results regardless of the equipment they have access to ...or their limitations (Ex. someone who can't run because of ankle pain). Too many women think they ""must run"", ""lift heavy"" or  do a lot of cardio to lose body fat... this is simply not true! We will blow this myth out of the water!  Online Access:  The Fat Loss workouts will be available online so that any woman with access to a computer or cell phone can follow along.









As you can see this is a gym designed for every segment of the female population - But Make No Mistake About It our Fat Loss Programs are going to change the way the fitness industry trains women! Let me explain why it's so different (keep in mind I've trained thousands of women all over the world using these methods).












These are two programs that we are very excited about, our Senior Fit program and our Excell program. These are two groups of women who are largely neglected in gyms everywhere. Unless you belong to a YMCA, you've probably never seen a class for seniors that focus on their needs specifically... Actually you've probably never seen any sort of class for seniors! Seniors realize how important Balance, Functional/Life Movements and Bone - Strengthening activities are... and that's what we will focus on.
The Excell program is so badly needed. many more young female athletes are participating in sports than ever before. many of these athletes have a chance to get College scholarships. We have coaches that work specifically with theses athletes. Being 
involved with boys athletics (I have two sons), I realize that there is a
 huge void in programs that are geared toward helping female athletes 
improve in their particular sport, eat correctly and maintain a positive
 self-image. 





ReSpin is one of several several programs that use the AfterBurn 50 program to burn fat faster and in a shorter amount of time: Resistance exercises are used to increase your heart rate... the cardio exercises/machines are used to maintain a lower heart rate in between the resistance cycles. This combination gives you faster fat loss and it preserves muscle so that your body looks fit and tone as you lose weight.


Anyone Can Take The Fat Loss classes. Don't think you 
have to be some super athlete or in great shape to participate in the 
Fat Loss classes. Anyone can get the same results as long as you follow 
the correct format. Maybe you can't run on a 
treadmill because of a nagging injury, or maybe you just don't like 
running. No problem, you can use a spin bike or an elliptical to achieve
 the same results.These fat loss workouts allow you to do that. It doesn't matter
 because there are many ways to achieve your goals as long as you follow the core principles..... 



Don't Live Near The Gym? No Problem! Not only will this gym be 
able to help many more women In the Buffalo area achieve results, but it 
also gives women all over the world online access to the workouts we do 
in the gym.
 Online Access is perfect for  women who workout alone or for the 
Personal Trainer or Group Instructor who struggles with clients who 
can't lose weight.










Police and Firefighter Training: Training for female Police and 
Firefighter recruits who have to take the physical fitness exam: I often
 get women come to me very late in the process with only a week or two 
remaining before their exam. This is not enough time and has led to many
 failures. I'm going to set up a program to identify these women early 
and get them in so they can ace their exams.








Speaker Series: Our goal is to bring in influential women from the community to talk about issues pertaining to women. Whether it's a discussion about health issues, demonstrating the new exercise craze (we have a bunch of ideas for unique classes), self-defense demonstrations, money matters or anything of interest to women - we will have a platform for it.

Domestic Violence 5K Run: My proudest moment last year was putting on this awesome run to support Haven House and victims of domestic violence. Every year we fund raise for a different women's cause. We've decided to make domestic violence our focus from now on. Being raised by a single mom I've always been an advocate of women. Seeing abuse growing up (fortunately not in my family) changed me and molded me into a person who has a need to celebrate and protect women... which is why I opened an all women's gym that was a safe and non-judgemental place for women to come and workout.








Women make up 1/2 of the 50 million gym memberships in the United States


Don't get me wrong there is a place for this type of training... but the fact is that most women want to lose some body fat and keep their existing muscle so that they look leaner and more toned... Therefore if these are the results you want then you must train specifically for them.
Women must train differently than men to achieve results. Women's workouts must be based in real science because it's so much harder for women to lose weight and get in shape.  I know, because I've trained women exclusively for many years! You can't just slap some exercises together, throw in a class or two and hope to get results. 90% of women who join a gym will quit due to lack of results. If they would have had workouts based on maximum calorie expenditure and proper exercise sequence - they could have gotten results in half the time.


FRUSTRATION:
About 10 years ago, While working in big box gyms as an independent trainer. I became frustrated for two reasons. 



Women, who were starting to come to gyms much more than ever before, were often not taken serious by trainers. The were often given programs designed for men. Very few got results and many times, women who came to the gym to lose weight were getting bigger!
The fat loss industry started to explode with bogus weight loss cures such as ""miracle"" diet pills, or exercise machines that could ""melt"" fat. These were all 100% ineffective solutions designed to take money from women who were desperate to get results 


fat loss body wraps
shake and juice diets

lasers that burn fat
cleanses
Infomercials: exercise machines making unbelievable claims
""miracle"" fat loss pills
infomercials: workout programs that only required 10-15 min a day to ""melt fat away""
every week there was a new ""secret"" ""rare"" or ""miracle"" Berry or Fruit from some far off country that ""holds the secret to fat loss""


This is Basically How It WAS and STILL Is Today: Like buying a car from a slimy used car salesman
    What We Need 
 The Goal is $20,000. This is the minimum that will allow us to set the gym up with the proper equipment. It's really important to understand that maximum results CAN be achieved with ""regular"" equipment that's found in any gym. We need a few specialized pieces of equipment (balance training, core training, sports training) - but we will never use 'gimmicky' or 'fad' equipment. 
What If I Don't Have A Gym Membership? Doesn't matter, we will show you how to perform these workouts at home with just some dumbbells (online access).


 
A gym like this need a variety of exercise machines. Rowers, ellipticals, treadmills, sleds, spin bikes, punching bags. Variety is a major component in women's fat loss. Another key component is resistance equipment: dumbbells, barbells and specialized/functional machines. Specialized equipment is important, for example, a hex bar allows women to train their legs with squats without having to put a heavy bar on their back. The goal is to have equipment that is adaptable to EVERYONE.

Video camera: to film workouts for online viewing

Polar Heart Rate System: http://www.polar.com/us-en/club
   



Large Display Screen (above): allows everyone to see their heart rates

Video Camera: record workouts for online access

The Team
 One person could not possibly make this work. It takes a team of dedicated instructors and leaders, committed to making this happen.

<br/><p>My name is Ismael, i´m a dietitian from Spain,
CEO of CINUSA Group (<a href=""http://www.cinusagroup.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.cinusagroup.com</a>), me and my team are working from more
than 7 years in nutrition and health. Enrolled my work, I can appreciate how
people choose bad unhealthy food everyday (snacks, sugar’s products,
chocolate´s bars, fast food, beverages, etc), and they remove from the
traditional food pattern products as fish, vegetables, fruits, legumes, water,
etc. When you ask to the people why the take those products, they say that are
in all commercials, markets, are cheap and delicious. </p>
<p>In other hand we had consciences about 2
problems in our society. 1) The increasing number of chronic disease (diabetes,
obesity, cardiovascular, cancer, allergy and intolerances…) and how this
pattern of consume is not help to much, and intake less vegetables foods (whole
grains, fruit, vegetables and legumes) is part of the problem. 2) How this kind
of consume is worst and dangerous for our planet. That´s mean for example for
300 grams of meat we spend 4500 liters of water, and just 900 liters for legumes.
</p>
<p>2 basic problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bad habits of food intake and
     unhealthy food options</li>
<li>Big problem of production, environmental
     impact and water footprint.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, that´s why, 1 year ago, we focus in start a
line of work to help people to offer new products, based in these 2 basic ideas
to give and respect the option of snack and nowadays´ pattern: healthy and respectful
with the environment.</p>
<p>LegumSnack, is a Healthy Nachos of legumes.
It´s a natural ingredients snack, completely vegan, gluten free, soy free, GMOs
free, baked-not fried-, high quality of vegan protein thank to the combined
legumes with cereals and superfoods. It´s free of common allergies (seafood and
shellfish, fish, nuts, cereal containing gluten, egg, milk and dairy, sulphur
dioxide, soya, nuts, peanuts, lupin, mustard, celery, sesame seeds), low salt,
low saturated fat and trans fat, high fiber, high minerals, high quality of
protein (the quality of protein is about the component which build the protein,
amino acids, and whether the number of essential amino acids has, that protein
is better for humans. Legumes hasn´t methionine, but cereals are high on it,
so, combined both we have a good quality of protein, that´s why traditionally
different gastronomy cultures mix in meals, as cuscus with chickpea, lentils
with rice, etc). We were looking for create a healthy and taste, delicious,
crunch snack, for children, adolescent and adults. </p>

Help us spreading the word about the db.coach project and join the program for yourself or donate subscription for people you care.We thank you and appreciate your support to help diabetes patients overcoming their disease. Your db.coach Team --- Deutsche Version --- Wer sind wir?Zusammen mit der Universität Basel (https://dsbg.unibas.ch) entwickeln wir eine  Diabetes-Coaching-Plattform, namens db.coach.Überlegen Sie sich einmal:
Alle 6 Sekunden stirbt ein Mensch an Diabetes
1 von 11 Erwachsenen hat Diabetes
Fast 50% der Diabetes-Fälle sind nicht diagnostiziert
Diese ziemlich schockierenden Fakten motivierten uns db.coach zu entwickeln um Menschen zu helfen ihren Lifestyle zu ändern, bevor dies Diabetes für sie tut. Was ist eigentlich das Problem der heutigen Diabetes-Behandlung?Diabetes wird grundsätzlich als eine chronisch, progressive verlaufende Krankheit behandelt.Leider sieht der standardisierte Therapieansatz meistens so aus:
Lebenslange Einnahme von Medikamenten
Steigende Dosierung der Medikamente
Entsprechende Nebeneffekte
Behandlung von Symptomen ohne die Ursache zu heilen
Tönt nicht gerade vielversprechend, oder? Was kann die Lösung sein?Diabetes muss nicht chronisch und progressiv verlaufen im Gegenteil, sie kann rückgängig gemacht werden!Die Studienlagen zeigt deutlich, dass mit angepassten und individualisierten Ernährungs- und Bewegungskonzepten die Krankheit Diabetes rückgängig gemacht werden kann. Wie funktioniert db.coach?

Registration und Daten-Input: Patient trägt seine Persönlichkeits-Merkale und Zielsetzung ein

Analyse & Planerstellung: Patient erhält – basierende auf seinen Eintragungen – seinen individualisierten Ernährungs- und Bewegungsplan, der jederzeit geändert werden kann und automatisch neu berechnet wird

Daten-Tracking: Daten werden laufend gesammelt und übersichtlich dargestellt, damit der Patient  über seine Fortschritte laufend informiert wird

Patient-Arzt Verbindung: Über die integrierte Experten-Support Applikation hat der behandelnde Arzt immer eine konsolidierte Übersicht über den Zustand des Patienten und kann so die Therapie optimieren
Was ist der Nutzen von db.coach?db.coach hilft Diabetes rückgängig zu machen. Wie unterscheiden wir uns von Mitbewerbern?Die meisten Diabetes Apps sind reine Tracking Apps. Die db.coach App offeriert aber zwei entscheidende Zusatzleistungen:
Erarbeitung von Diabetes-spezifischen, individualisierten Ernährungs-und Bewegungsprogramme, basierend auf dem aktuellsten Stand der  Sports- und Ernährungswissenschaft
Integrierte Austausch- und Rückmeldung Applikation zwischen Patient und Arzt, über die der Patient seine Daten mit dem Arzt austauschen kann und dieser bei Bedarf intervenieren kann, um so die Therapiequalität zu optimieren
 Wie sieht der Entwicklungsplan von db.coach aus?
1 Monat um die Betaversion einer Mobile-freundlichen Web-Applikation zu lancieren
2 Monate um die Vollversion mit integrierter Experten-Verbindung zu lancieren
Sollten wir 40’000 $ erreichen, werden wir zusätzlich noch eine Mobile App (iPhone, Android) entwickeln
 Um dies zu erreichen, brauchen wir deine UnterstützungUnsere Erfahrung, Passion und Überzeugung motivierten uns selber Geld in die Entwicklung eines Prototypen zu investieren. Für die finale Version und Vermarktung von db.coach brauchen wir aber zusätzliche finanzielle Unterstützung.Mach unsere Mission zu deiner eigenen Mission und helfe Diabetes-Patienten ihre Krankheit erfolgreich zu bekämpfen.Hilf uns die Idee zu verbreiten, werde selber Mitglied bei db.coach,  oder ermögliche die Mitgliedschaft jemandem, der Dir nahe steht.

<h3>i3-garden Weiterentwicklung,</h3>
<h3>dafür brauchen wir Eure Unterstützung!</h3>
<p>Wir stehen erst am Anfang. i3-garden versteht sich als ein flexibles und modulares Gartensystem, das für jeden Haushalt und für jede Wohnsituation adaptierbar ist bzw. sein wird. Es wird in naher Zukunft weitere verschiedene Ausführungsmodelle geben -<i>Benjamin möchte auch Geschwister!</i><br/>Bei uns steht der Anwender/Kunde mit seinen Bedürfnissen im Fokus. So entwickeln wir gleichzeitig in mehrere Richtungen - für den Gartenprofi, der sich sein Erdsubstrat selber mischt und jede Pflanze einzeln gießt bis hin zum bequemen Laien, der  mit dem Plug&amp;Play Prinzip einfach seine frischen Lebensmittel mit ""sauberen Fingern"" ernten möchte, ohne viel Zeit- und Arbeitsaufwand.<br/>Wir wollen unserem Kunden nichts verkaufen bzw. aufzwingen, was er nicht braucht und will, so gestalten wir unsere Systeme von Grund auf modular, d.h. mit dem Zubehörprogramm ist alles den Bedürfnissen entsprechend jederzeit nachrüstbar (z.B. autom. Bewässerung, Kälteschutz, elektrischer Schneckenschutz usw.). Wir haben bereits für die nächsten 3 Jahre ausgearbeitete und getestete Konzepte, Ideen für mindestens weitere 5+ Jahre!</p>
<p>Derzeit arbeiten wir hart an der <strong>Weiterentwicklung</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kälteschutz für die Übergangszeit</li>
<li>Pflanzen-Ranksystem</li>
<li>i3-Sockel für lndoor-Einsatz</li>
<li>Online Konfigurator =Erleichterung für ""Neu-Gärtner""</li>
<li>i3-Erdsubstrat als Einsatz für den i3-<i>Benjamin</i>
</li>
<li>elektrischer  Schneckenschutz</li>
<li>Optimierung der Produktion und Kostenreduzierung</li>
<li>Glashaus mit Beheizung für den Winterbetrieb</li>
<li>wir wollen in naher Zukunft auch Jungpflanzen bereits im i3-Dock anbieten- kein Umpflanzen mehr notwendig</li>
</ul>
<h3 style=""margin-left:40px;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>i3-garden – further developments –</strong></h3>
<h3 style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>and this is why we need your support!</strong></h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">This is only the beginning. i3-garden is a flexible and modular garden system which (soon) can be adapted for each household and housing situation. In the future, there will be different design models - <i>Benjamin wants brothers and sisters!</i><br/>We focus on users/customers and their needs. Therefore, we have been developing the system in several directions – for gardening professionals who mix their own soil substrate and individually water every one of their plants to more laid-back amateurs who simply want to use the plug&amp;play principle to harvest their own fresh produce while keeping their hands clean and minimising their time and work expenditure.<br/>We don't want to sell our customers anything that they don't need and want. Therefore, we use a modular system design on all levels. In other words, our accessories programme ensures that all systems can always be upgraded depending on one's needs (e.g. automatic watering system, protection against the cold, electrical slug and snail protection, etc.). We already have worked out and tested concepts for the next three years and have collected ideas to last an additional 5+ years!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Currently, we are working hard on the following <strong>developments</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">temperature-protection during spring / autumn</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">climbing system for plants</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">​i3-Base for indoor use</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">online configurator = the easy way for newcomers to gardening</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">i3-Soil substrate to be used with the i3-<i>Benjamin</i>
</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">electrical slug and snail protection</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">optimising production and reducing costs</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">heated greenhouse for winter gardening</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">In the near future, we also want to offer young plants already in the i3-Dock, thus eliminating the need for re-planting</li>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>""Upcycling"" – </i>We don't want to produce and sell things that all people can produce themselves with simple means! We are happy to offer instruction and small components that will allow you to put waste products to new use. For example, one can simply use disposable bottles or containers to build a ""high-level tank"" for the watering system. <strong>This way, you can save money and help the environment!</strong></p>

i3-garden – further developments –
and this is why we need your support!
This is only the beginning. i3-garden is a flexible and modular garden system which (soon) can be adapted for each household and housing situation. In the future, there will be different design models - Benjamin wants brothers and sisters!We focus on users/customers and their needs. Therefore, we have been developing the system in several directions – for gardening professionals who mix their own soil substrate and individually water every one of their plants to more laid-back amateurs who simply want to use the plug&play principle to harvest their own fresh produce while keeping their hands clean and minimising their time and work expenditure.We don't want to sell our customers anything that they don't need and want. Therefore, we use a modular system design on all levels. In other words, our accessories programme ensures that all systems can always be upgraded depending on one's needs (e.g. automatic watering system, protection against the cold, electrical slug and snail protection, etc.). We already have worked out and tested concepts for the next three years and have collected ideas to last an additional 5+ years!
Currently, we are working hard on the following developments:

temperature-protection during spring / autumn
climbing system for plants
​i3-Base for indoor use
online configurator = the easy way for newcomers to gardening
i3-Soil substrate to be used with the i3-Benjamin

electrical slug and snail protection
optimising production and reducing costs
heated greenhouse for winter gardening
In the near future, we also want to offer young plants already in the i3-Dock, thus eliminating the need for re-planting


Willkommen in der i3-Community


""Die Summe des geteilten Wissens ist immer höher als das Wissen eines einzelnen Genies! 
Wir nehmen euch und eure Ideen ernst! All unsere Konzepte und Ideen sind nichts wert, wenn diese dem Anwender/Kunden keinen Nutzen bringen - hier benötigen wir EUCH, die Community, die uns mit konstruktiver Kritik, Ratschlägen, Erfahrungen, Tipps bei der Weiterentwicklung unterstützen!Als Dankeschön für unsere Unterstützerinnen und Unterstützer wollen wir Euch hier interessante und attraktive Perks anbieten. 
Welcome to the i3-Community
""The sum of all knowledge shared is always more than the entire knowledge of an individual genius!
We take you and your ideas seriously! All of our concepts and ideas are worth nothing, unless they create benefits for users/customers – and this is where we need YOU, the community supporting our development with constructive criticism, tips and experiences!To thank you, our supporters, we would like to offer interesting and attractive incentives here.
 
  Worüber wir nachdenken  

""Wir wollen verantwortungsvoll mit Ressourcen und Energie umgehen""  - deshalb legen wir bei der Konstruktion und Materialauswahl größten Wert auf ""lebensmittelecht"", lange Haltbarkeit und Einfachheit. Dabei sind alle Materialien zu 100% recyclebar. 
""Upcycling"" - Wir wollen hier keine Dinge produzieren und teuer verkaufen, die jeder selbst mit einfachen Mitteln herstellen kann! Wir geben gerne Anleitungen und bieten entsprechende Kleinteile an, um aus ""Abfall-Produkten"" neue Verwendungsmöglichkeiten zu schaffen. So kann man sich ganz einfach aus Flaschen, Einmal-Gebinden oder Kanister einen ""Hochtank"" für das Bewässerungssystem bauen. So spart ihr Geld und schont die Umwelt!
""Wo wir verkaufen wollen, müssen wir auch etwas zurückgeben"" - der i3-Benjamin wird mit größter Sorgfalt zu 100% in der EU erzeugt.
 
           What we are thinking about
""We want to use material and energy resources responsibly"". Therefore, in our construction and material selection we strongly focus on food-save materials, a long service life and simplicity. All materials can be recycled to 100%. 
""Upcycling"" – We don't want to produce and sell things that all people can produce themselves with simple means! We are happy to offer instruction and small components that will allow you to put waste products to new use. For example, one can simply use disposable bottles or containers to build a ""high-level tank"" for the watering system. This way, you can save money and help the environment!
""We want to give something back to the region where we sell our products"" - the i3-Benjamin  is produced with the greatest care to 100% in the EU.

<h3>Help those you care about survive their Cancer Journey</h3>
<p>My name is Peter Green, Founder of Workout Through Cancer (WOTC). </p>
<p>13 years ago, when I heard the words ""We found something"", my world imploded. I was told I had brain cancer. </p>
<p>After my diagnosis, I went through a clinical trial that required 6 months of chemotherapy and 25 days of full brain radiation. I was a single Dad with a 10-year-old son. In addition to the great care I received from my doctors, I attribute my ability to survive my treatment - now 13 years in remission - to the adaptive exercise program I developed.</p>
<p>I launched my company Workout Through Cancer in 2017. Our mission is to provide hope, inspiration, guidance <u><i>and tools</i></u> specifically designed for those going through, and coming out of, cancer treatment. In the U.S. that's over 3 million people every year. </p>
<p>As a survivor, I know the fear and challenges that each of these 3 million people going into, and coming out of treatment, feel. And the questions: ""What comes next for me?""  ""What comes next for my family?"" Cancer is a brutal disease. It rips apart the fabric of peoples lives. It doesn't care about your life before cancer. When you're diagnosed, you still have responsibilities, a family, a career, friends. I know because I've been there and I am committed -  compelled - to help those going through cancer treatment to win their cancer battle. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518746065/g5vfn4hhtrot3iq55lul.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>The funding from this $75,000 campaign will allow all of us at Workout Through Cancer to continue to build our cancer community and to provide our Fitness Packs to cancer patients in need. Using our Fitness Pack and adaptive Oncologist approved exercise program is a step that helps those that have been touched by cancer - you, a family member or a friend - to take action and begin to fight!</p>
<p>Your investment helps those going through cancer treatment in a number of ways, from hands-on services that include direct coaching for individuals and cancer support groups to items that help patients feel more comfortable as they go through treatment.  </p>
<h3><b>The Medical Community recognizes the benefits of what we're doing.</b></h3>
<p><strong>Dr. Neal Fischbach</strong> <i>(Dr. of Oncology, Smilow Cancer Hospital, Yale Medical)</i></p>
<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/weYLLbzdnYY?rel=0"" width=""560""></iframe></div><p> </p>
<p>The Workout Through Cancer program is the only exercise program specifically designed for cancer patients. Today the medical community - some 13 years after I was first diagnosed - is now embracing exercise while in treatment because of all the benefits exercise provides.</p>
<p>If you're the one going through treatment, or coming out of treatment, the benefits of exercise can make a huge difference. Exercise helps:</p>
<p><strong> - Raise your level of cancer-fighting antioxidants</strong></p>
<p> <strong>- Improve the body's ability to fight inflammation</strong></p>
<p><strong> - Stimulate healthy cell metabolism</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Reduce anxiety and depression </strong></p>
<p><strong> - Aid recovery from the fatigue that is associated with chemotherapy and radiation treatment</strong></p>
<p>WOTC's exercise program - integrating exercise with meditative breathing - is adapted to the specific needs of patients who are going through cancer treatment because during treatment, nothing is the same as before. Metabolism rates change, energy levels change, the immune system is challenged. Patients can get the benefits of our exercise program whether they're standing up, lying down or sitting in a chair. Importantly, our exercise program is designed to be done at home which is really important because many cancer patients' immune systems are compromised and they can't expose themselves to a lot of people. </p>
<h3><strong>The WOTC exercise program and the Fitness Pack</strong></h3>
<h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518733071/mtgznpladsciefubjy2v.jpg"" src=""""/></h2>
<p><i>T<u>he adaptive exercises using the WOTC Fitness Pack gives patients the tools to fight.</u></i>  At the core of Workout Through Cancer is our Fitness Pack and our guided exercise program.  If you're going through treatment, our 14 core movements can be done in the comfort and safety of your home and at your own pace. Our guided program is available on the DVD/USB drive in every Fitness Pack and through the Workout Through Cancer site <u><a href=""http://www.workoutthroughcancer.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.workoutthroughcancer.com</a>  </u></p>
<p>WOTC's exercise program is Oncologist approved and is built around the unique requirements of cancer patients. It is specifically designed to help those going through, and coming out of, cancer treatment to stay strong both physically and mentally and to help sustain them for the years living beyond cancer.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The $75,000 that we're seeking to raise can serve those going through cancer treatment in  multiple ways:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Provide you, a loved one, a friend or a colleague with the exercise program and apparel needed by anyone going through chemotherapy, radiation and surgery. You choose where you want our Fitness Packs and curated apparel to go.</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>Make available coaching and training sessions directly with Peter. Cancer patients want to talk with others who are living with, and beyond, cancer treatment. Peter is an active ""cancer coach"" and a number of our Perks enable individuals and Support groups to work directly with him. </p>
<p><strong>3.</strong>  Help us build our on-line cancer support community. All the content on the WOTC web site is free and we're adding to it constantly. Our content is focused on one thing: <strong>bringing guidance, support, inspiration and the tools to fight for anyone who is going through their cancer journey.  </strong></p>
<p>Most people, when they hear that someone close to them has been diagnosed, ask <strong>""How can I help?"" </strong>Many send flowers, fruit baskets, candy or offer to make meals. This is all really kind as I know people want to help. However, the reality is that when someone is going through cancer treatment, even many of the foods and beverages we were able to enjoy pre-treatment s might be more harmful than helpful.</p>
<p>Many of our Perks are designed to directly help individuals and groups by making Fitness Packs available. All of our Perks support the development of the WOTC community we are building. A community where cancer patients and their families can share their stories and connect with others who are also going through, or have gone through, this life-changing moment.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:280px;""><strong>FAQ</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why is Workout Through Cancer both a for-profit and nonprofit business?</strong></p>
<p>WOTC believes a company can do well by doing good. We also believe that a for-profit business can, in some cases, be more agile and move more quickly than a nonprofit business when the need arises. That being said, we also appreciate the unique strengths a nonprofit organization can bring to our mission. WOTC will have both a for-profit and a nonprofit arm: the WOTC Foundation.  10% of WOTC's for-profit net income will go into the WOTC Foundation. Our Foundation will provide Fitness Packs to those that can't afford them and also support other organizations focused on helping cancer patients - both survivors and co survivors - learn to navigate life with cancer.</p>
<p><strong>If I am a patient, a cancer survivor or a cancer co-survivor, why should I sign up to become part of the WOTC community?  </strong></p>
<p><strong>The one thing I am positive about! </strong>People going through cancer feel most comfortable with others going through the same experience. By becoming part of the WOTC community just your presence - whether you are actively participating or just taking in all the content provided - will be invaluable. My hope is that a large percentage of our content will be created  by those sharing their current, or past, experience. The site has been designed just for that purpose. It provides easy-to-use applications for sharing stories, insights or messages of support. By joining the WOTC community you become part of a very special group of people that can make a difference for so many in need.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If anyone says there are no risk in starting a business there would be tens of million entrepreneurs. The word entrepreneur in itself represents risk, but it also represents <strong>passion</strong>. Workout Through Cancer is my <strong>passion. </strong>This passion doesn't blind me - or the rest of the WOTC team - to the challenges faced by all young ventures. But as we launch our Indiegogo campaign, we've already laid a solid foundation for the journey ahead of us and have already generated exciting momentum and awareness of our mission and of WOTC.  </p>

<p style=""font-weight:300;font-size:87%;"">The World Bank estimates 20% the education of a girl living in the developing world is missed because of their periods. In Kenya alone, annually about 100 million working days are lost due to women staying at home during their period.</p>
<p style=""font-weight:300;font-size:87%;"">In many of the communities in which partners operate families are living on US$1-2 per day, yet each month girls and women need to find a solution. While conducting pilot workshops we’ve been confronted with cringe worthy accounts of what they resorted to during their periods.</p>
<ul>
<li style=""font-weight:300;font-size:87%;"">Girls would stay home from school to sit in a corner and bleed</li>
<li style=""font-weight:300;font-size:87%;"">Teenagers often engaged in transactional sex with older men to get the money they needed to purchase pads</li>
<li style=""font-weight:300;font-size:87%;"">Grown women would skip work for fear of an accident</li>
<li style=""font-weight:300;font-size:87%;"">Others would find use whatever they could find, mattress filling, leaves, tissue, old cloth, pretty much anything that could absorb the flow</li>
</ul>
<p style=""font-weight:300;font-size:87%;"">Our goal is not only to provide each country with at least 4,000 donated WonderCups but also to create a WonderCup salesforce of women who will sell the cups at a fair market rate ~$4.00 and earn a commission for their efforts. With your support we can scale the pilot programs, work with additional organizations and reach more women. Moreover, in each country we are supporting women’s entrepreneurship locally packaging and manufacturing the reusable bags.</p>

<p style=""font-weight:300;font-size:87%;"">We've already changed the normal donation model, but giving away WonderCups is not a solution in itself. There is a lack of reproductive health education in the communities in which we are working. We help our partners conduct workshops with school girls and women's groups (both formal and informal). During these session our expert trainers explain how the female reproductive system works, what it means to be a virgin, how STIs are transmitted, and of course how to properly use, store, sterilize a WonderCup cup.</p>

<p style=""font-weight:300;font-size:87%;"">Now you understand the social impact, think of the environmental impact. Every year, approximately 20 billion pads, tampons, and applicators find their way into North American landfills. To put it another way, the average woman bleeds for a total of 6 years over the course of her life. Do you know how many disposable products it takes to absorb that much blood? It’s about half a truck’s worth and not a pick-up truck we're talking a long haul rig. So even if the plight of young women in the developing world doesn’t urge you to click the contribute button think about the carbon emissions and the refuse that lands in the ocean.</p>

<p style=""font-weight:300;font-size:87%;"">WonderCup is an environmentally friendly affordable alternative to tampons and pads. The menstrual cup is made of soft 100% medical grade silicone. Unlike tampons, the WonderCup is inserted into the body to collect menstrual blood not absorb it, so it may be worn for extended periods of time.

</div></div>","WHAT IS A MENSTRUAL CUP?A menstrual cup a feminine hygiene product. It is worn inside during menstruation to catch not absorb menstrual blood. They are ideal for physically active women.We are excited to spread awareness and introduce the WonderCup to women worldwide. The WonderCup offers the perfect solution for women wishing to save money, be healthier, reduce her carbon footprint or be free from the hassles of pads and tampons. We know this product has the potential to change hundreds of millions of women’s lives for the better. The time has come to break the stigma and taboos surrounding menstruation and we are on the frontlines. For every WonderCup or Miracle Cup we sell online we will donate ten to one of our partner organizations in developing nations. -Volker Bassen, CEO WonderCup 

 
 
CHANGING LIVES 

If you have heard your friends on social media raving about the menstrual cup revolution well here is your chance to try it out and give back at the same time.For each 1 you buy we give 10 to one of our partner organizations in Kenya, Colombia, and Ghana.
The World Bank estimates 20% the education of a girl living in the developing world is missed because of their periods. In Kenya alone, annually about 100 million working days are lost due to women staying at home during their period.
In many of the communities in which partners operate families are living on US$1-2 per day, yet each month girls and women need to find a solution. While conducting pilot workshops we’ve been confronted with cringe worthy accounts of what they resorted to during their periods.

Girls would stay home from school to sit in a corner and bleed
Teenagers often engaged in transactional sex with older men to get the money they needed to purchase pads
Grown women would skip work for fear of an accident
Others would find use whatever they could find, mattress filling, leaves, tissue, old cloth, pretty much anything that could absorb the flow

Our goal is not only to provide each country with at least 4,000 donated WonderCups but also to create a WonderCup salesforce of women who will sell the cups at a fair market rate ~$4.00 and earn a commission for their efforts. With your support we can scale the pilot programs, work with additional organizations and reach more women. Moreover, in each country we are supporting women’s entrepreneurship locally packaging and manufacturing the reusable bags.
Please visit our site for more information about WonderCup

 
BREAKING THE MOLD

We've already changed the normal donation model, but giving away WonderCups is not a solution in itself. There is a lack of reproductive health education in the communities in which we are working. We help our partners conduct workshops with school girls and women's groups (both formal and informal). During these session our expert trainers explain how the female reproductive system works, what it means to be a virgin, how STIs are transmitted, and of course how to properly use, store, sterilize a WonderCup cup.
By March of 2017 we will begin selling our cups in select North American, European, Australian, and South American markets with the same Buy 1 Donate 10 model.

 
PILOT PROGAMS

While the company is based in Kenya, we partnered with organizations in Ghana and Colombia focused on female justice issues. With their support we launch this fundraising campaign to bring WonderCups to as many girls and women as possible.
We know WonderCups can't change every girl's life but we want to reach as many as possible with this affordable healthy technology.
In Ghana we work with The Sangy Foundation- Guided by purpose and passion to help young people live healthier lives, The Sangy Foundation seeks to provide quality health prevention information and education of the youth that will lead to better health outcomes and healthier young people. The Foundation was registered in Ghana in 2014. They are conducting workshops in schools about reproductive health and the benefits of the WonderCup.
In Kenya we are working with The Cup and Maasai women's groups. They believe Investing in girls can unleash their potential and make an impact on the whole society. Many girls in poverty are being left behind, simply because they don’t have the resources or information to handle their periods. Our project in Kenya fights taboos associated with menstruation and raises awareness about the benefits of using a menstrual cup. They conduct workshops with doctors, rural health organizations and in the largest slum in East Africa.
In Colombia we are working with FICA Mujeres, who started an independent self-funded program to spread their belief in menstrual cups to women in low income areas and Mini Ku Suto. Working  in at risk communities across the country, they  conduct intimate workshops where women can safely discuss reproductive health issues.

 
ECO-FRIENDLY

Now you understand the social impact, think of the environmental impact. Every year, approximately 20 billion pads, tampons, and applicators find their way into North American landfills. To put it another way, the average woman bleeds for a total of 6 years over the course of her life. Do you know how many disposable products it takes to absorb that much blood? It’s about half a truck’s worth and not a pick-up truck we're talking a long haul rig. So even if the plight of young women in the developing world doesn’t urge you to click the contribute button think about the carbon emissions and the refuse that lands in the ocean.
OUR PRODUCTS
WonderCup is an environmentally friendly affordable alternative to tampons and pads. The menstrual cup is made of soft 100% medical grade silicone. Unlike tampons, the WonderCup is inserted into the body to collect menstrual blood not absorb it, so it may be worn for extended periods of time. Between uses keep it in the reusable sack in a dry place. WonderCup is easily cleaned with soapy water and before each use your WonderCup should be sterilized by placing it in boiling water for 5 minutes. Your WonderCup can last for up to ten years.

The MiracleCup is called so because like the WonderCup it is reusable, and made of 100% medical grade silicone but it has an extra feature. An innovative valve at the bottom which allows the wearer to keep the MiracleCup in throughout her period. She can drain the build through the valve as often as she likes.
We created four sizes to suit the different sizes of women's bodies. The largest WonderCup holds three times as much fluid as a super-max tampon. Depending on your flow, you may only need to change it two times a day, and because menstrual blood only smells when in comes into contact with air, i.e. the smell associated with pads, you don’t have to worry about any odor since the WonderCup sits inside your body.
