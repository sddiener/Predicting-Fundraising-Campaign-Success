<p><b>The Project:</b></p>
<p>I am producing RENT in the spring of 
2014 March 29th 2pm and 8pm (and student performance Friday the 28th) at
 the California Theatre in San Bernardino, California. The Inland Empire
 of California is one of the most economically challenged areas in the 
entire country. We are second to on Detroit economically. That said, 
most in the community can't afford theatre. We do have patrons, they 
love the theatre,  and still try to come as often as they can. In order 
to keep tickets cheap,  I need help paying some of the cost of the 
production. If you folks would hep me pay for the show royalty,  that 
would be tremendous. I will be trying to get student performances set up
 that will allow the most needy students in our community to see the 
show for free.</p>
<p>The style of the production will be true to 
Jonathan Larsons vision. Jonathan Larson told an interviewer once that, 
""in the theater, the old thing about how you can make a killing but you 
can't make a living is absolutely true. I'm living proof of that."" . </p>
<p>Rent will play the 1700 seat California Theatre of the Performing Arts May 29, 2014 2pm and 8pm.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The
 November workshop of RENT in 1994 must have been a magical thing to 
see. We want to celebrate the way that RENT has grown in the 20 years 
that has passed since the 1994 workshop. We will be trying to get access
 to some of the original songs that did not make the show to play in the
 pre-show, with a narrative of why they did not make the production, as 
well as a narrative of the time leading up to opening night of the show. <br/></p>

<p><b>Why this production is important:</b></p>
<p>As a straight man 
producing live theatre,  I am often surprised at how my fellow GLBT, 
actors, producers, make-up artists, stagehands and in general... FRIENDS
 are still treated in this time and age we live in.  Why do we still 
judge people based on how they live their lives, as opposed to the 
quality of human that they have become? Until there is equality for all 
in this nation of FREEDOM, we must continue to show RENT. This 
production shows us that no matter who or what we are, death takes us 
all. We have to address homophobia full force,  and one of the best ways
 to do that is to keep presenting material like RENT that shows us, we 
are all simply humans,  trying to get by in a world that will keep 
spinning long after we are gone. And we all need love.</p>

<p>The night of the final dress rehearsal, Jonathan was sick with a
 sore chest and a fever. But he took a taxi to Fourth Street, watched 
the show, and sat for his interview with the Times. The last thing

 do. The first performance was scheduled for that evening. Jim Nicola's 
first inclination was to cancel, but he knew they needed to do something
 for Jonathan's memory. Jim was uneasy. The first act, in particular, 
involved a lot of tricky dancing and jumping on tables. It hadn't been 
completely rehearsed, and he was afraid there would be injuries. Eddie 
Rosenstein urged him to run the whole show full out. By the evening, 
Jonathan's friends were streaming into the theatre, his parents were 
there, New York Theatre workshop was filled to capacity with people Jon 
loved - friends, family and colleagues. Jim decided on a sing-through - 
no movement, just songs. Throughout the first act, the cast was able to 
hold their seats. But very slowly, they began to rise. They acted, they 
danced. ""It was incredible and terrible,"" Anthony remembers. ""It was 
like we had to do it. We were all sobbing and crying."" The lighting 
people made their way to the lighting booth; the sound manager began to 
pick up his cues. ""They couldn't contain themselves,"" Eddie remembers. 
""The audience was reaching out to the cast. They were crying and 
cheering. By the second act, it was no longer contained. It was the full
 show run full-out, with every line hit for greater and greater meaning.
 If emotion could have become a physical force, the roof would have 
blown off, the weather would have changed."" The second act ended. There 
was a huge ovation, the cast slowly left the stage, and the audience 
stayed in the theater. No one was sure what to do. The cast returned and
 sat down in the front row. Finally, a single voice called from the 
audience, ""Thank you, Jonathan Larson,"" which brought the evening's 
loudest, final burst of applause. <p></p>

the last performance venue of humorist Will Rogers prior to his death in

<p>The first version of King Kong was test screened to an audience at 
the California Theatre,  in January 1933, before the official release. 
At that time the film contained a scene showing what happened to the 
sailors who were shaken from the log by Kong, showing that they were 
eaten alive at the bottom of the ravine by a giant spider, giant crab, 
giant lizard and an octopoid. The spider-pit scene provoked many members
 of the audience to scream, leave the theatre and even faint. After the 
preview, Merian C. Cooper cut the scene.</p>

insisting that the song was a loser and destined to hurt the movie. It

We are searching for young creative and talented people and help them make their dreams come true (dancers, singers, photographers, actors). We are not making anyone rich, just help them with promotional stuff. Our projects haven't made much profit yet, therefore we are searching for financial help to buy a proper equipment to support further projects. Also, we would get a excellent result of what we can make if there is a proper budget behind a project.The beginning: Mission 1 - The Pharaohs. 
We have all seen dozen of choreography videos, which are kind of non-budget and usually quickly made. We find that quite boring therefore we are trying to do some kind of a choreography video with a story. The only problem is that it's quite hard to get budget for this kind of videos, that is why we are asking you to help. We are currently working on a nonprofit project called ""Time is a Currency"" with the Pharaohs. The story is about our lives and how we aren't able to control our time and enjoy it. Dance type is hip hop with some stuns.We are going to make a 4 up to 5 minutes long ""music/dance"" video. Just like our previous one.The Pharaohs represent a group of 8 young dancers, high school students and college students, that began their dancing career in local dance crew in Celje, Slovenia.

The end
You can also help us by promoting our project or sharing our previous video.If the project will receive positive feedback, we are going to publish choreography tutorial. In case we don't reach the goal, we will just buy cheaper equipment which means that the project will be done either way.This is more or less everything.

<h3>New Orleans Fringe Festival Parade -- it's a tradition!</h3>
<p>Now in its 6th year, the collaboration between the Fringe Festival and the Goodchildren Social Aid &amp; Pleasure Club is ready to scale new heights! But in these tough times, our regular sources of funding are pretty tapped out -- less money to go around, more requests for it. So we've come to you!</p>
Our mission, unchanged since 2007, is to revitalize St. Claude, through celebration and cultural preservation. We have, over ther years, kept our parades as accessible as possible, while retaining the traditions of the neighborhoods we serve.<br/><p>After our first parade in 2008, aptly titled ""Resurrection"" in honor of the changes taking place all over our city after the floods of Katrina, we were invited to produce a parade for the Fringe Festival -- by our very first Easter Bunny, one of the founders of the New Orleans Fringe!</p>
<p><img alt=""Easter Bunny"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.weebly.com/uploads/5/7/7/2/5772187/174428_orig.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""bunny""/></p>
<p>From the first, we took the values of the many diverse neighborhoods surrounding St. Claude very seriously. We meant to be affordable, sustainable, dedicated to reuse and recycle, creative and inclusive.</p>
<p>We called ourselves ""Goodchildren"" in honor of the original name of St. Claude (Bons Enfants = Good Children). We rescued dolls from dumpsters and thrift stores, decorated them and used them as our signature throw. We pledged ourselves to not leaving a mess, and the Dukes of Debris was born.</p>
<p><img alt=""Dukes"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.weebly.com/uploads/5/7/7/2/5772187/1889929_orig.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Dukes of Debris""/></p>
<p>We held our meetings and parties at local businesses, to show our gratitude for everyone who came back or stayed after Katrina. In fact, many of our early sponsors were local businesses and organizations. We still hold events and parties at bars and backyards in our neighborhoods.</p>
<p>We also make it a point to honor our elders, at St. Margaret's and Holy Angels, with parade stops and band performances. These are, after all, the very people who made these neighborhoods, and we want them to know how much we love them!</p>
<p><img alt=""The Band at St. Margaret's"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.weebly.com/uploads/5/7/7/2/5772187/6648305_orig.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""bandstmargarets""/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<img alt=""breakdown of expenses"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/medias/949425/pictures/full/20130725184223-colorpiechart_jpg.JPG?1374802944"" src="""" style="""" title=""pie chart""/>
</div>
<div>This pie chart shows how the money we raise will get spent. Much of it is non-negotiable, i.e., police escort and insurance, fees and fulfillment.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If we make our goal, we will be able to obtain all the supplies we need for promotion and publicity, and for band expenses and throws.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>NOPD Escort - 40% ($1600)</div>
<div>   Lead and follow car, motorcylce escorts/traffic control, 6-8 officers</div>
<div>Insurance - 10% ($400)</div>
<div>   We insure for $1M</div>
<div>Pub/Promo - 20% ($800)</div>
<div>    Postcards, flyers, buttons, stickers, etc</div>
<div>Supplies - 20% ($800)</div>
<div>    Office, parade and band supplies</div>
<div>Fees/Fulfillment - 10% ($400)</div>
<div>     Rewards, packaging and postage</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If we don't reach the full amount, we will still roll. We're committed to that. If there is shortfall, it will come from supplies and promotion.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If we go over our goal, we will be able to continue our band outreach to the kids in the neighborhood, and possibly get them some drums and sticks!</div>
<div> </div>
<div><img alt=""King Al and the Band"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.weebly.com/uploads/5/7/7/2/5772187/8972825_orig.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""kingalband""/></div>
<div> </div>
<div>We think we have come up with some tempting rewards (check 'em out!) including our handmade throws, parade buttons and stickers, and a chance to be part of our royalty! We really love that highest level a lot -- and we hope someone takes advantage of it!</div>
<div>
<h3>Why It Matters</h3>
In the 5 years we've been doing this, we have seen remarkable comebacks and new growth along St. Claude. While we can't take ALL the credit, we are proud to have played a small role in bringing people out to see our progress. Like the Fringe Festival, we are deeply committed to our community, and we love the spontaneous combustion of combining neighborhood groups, bands, dance groups, artists, Mardi Gras Indians, buskers, businesses, cheerleaders, bike sculptures and random locals with Fringe performers from all over the county, and indeed the world!</div>
<div> </div>
<div><img alt=""Fringe Parade 2012 - Moving Heavy Things"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.weebly.com/uploads/5/7/7/2/5772187/7254904_orig.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""fringeseesaw""/></div>
<div> </div>
<div>And we are equally committed to keeping it free and accessible for as long as we can. We absolutely adore the fact that just about everyone can be in our parades -- the spirit of New Orleans abounds and abides.</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

Now in its 6th year, the collaboration between the Fringe Festival and the Goodchildren Social Aid & Pleasure Club is ready to scale new heights! But in these tough times, our regular sources of funding are pretty tapped out -- less money to go around, more requests for it. So we've come to you!
Our mission, unchanged since 2007, is to revitalize St. Claude, through celebration and cultural preservation. We have, over ther years, kept our parades as accessible as possible, while retaining the traditions of the neighborhoods we serve.After our first parade in 2008, aptly titled ""Resurrection"" in honor of the changes taking place all over our city after the floods of Katrina, we were invited to produce a parade for the Fringe Festival -- by our very first Easter Bunny, one of the founders of the New Orleans Fringe!

From the first, we took the values of the many diverse neighborhoods surrounding St. Claude very seriously. We meant to be affordable, sustainable, dedicated to reuse and recycle, creative and inclusive.
We called ourselves ""Goodchildren"" in honor of the original name of St. Claude (Bons Enfants = Good Children). We rescued dolls from dumpsters and thrift stores, decorated them and used them as our signature throw. We pledged ourselves to not leaving a mess, and the Dukes of Debris was born.

We held our meetings and parties at local businesses, to show our gratitude for everyone who came back or stayed after Katrina. In fact, many of our early sponsors were local businesses and organizations. We still hold events and parties at bars and backyards in our neighborhoods.
We also make it a point to honor our elders, at St. Margaret's and Holy Angels, with parade stops and band performances. These are, after all, the very people who made these neighborhoods, and we want them to know how much we love them!



What We Need & What You Get


This pie chart shows how the money we raise will get spent. Much of it is non-negotiable, i.e., police escort and insurance, fees and fulfillment.
 
If we make our goal, we will be able to obtain all the supplies we need for promotion and publicity, and for band expenses and throws.
 
NOPD Escort - 40% ($1600)
   Lead and follow car, motorcylce escorts/traffic control, 6-8 officers
Insurance - 10% ($400)
   We insure for $1M
Pub/Promo - 20% ($800)
    Postcards, flyers, buttons, stickers, etc
Supplies - 20% ($800)
    Office, parade and band supplies
Fees/Fulfillment - 10% ($400)
     Rewards, packaging and postage
 
If we don't reach the full amount, we will still roll. We're committed to that. If there is shortfall, it will come from supplies and promotion.
 
If we go over our goal, we will be able to continue our band outreach to the kids in the neighborhood, and possibly get them some drums and sticks!
 

 
We think we have come up with some tempting rewards (check 'em out!) including our handmade throws, parade buttons and stickers, and a chance to be part of our royalty! We really love that highest level a lot -- and we hope someone takes advantage of it!

Why It Matters
In the 5 years we've been doing this, we have seen remarkable comebacks and new growth along St. Claude. While we can't take ALL the credit, we are proud to have played a small role in bringing people out to see our progress. Like the Fringe Festival, we are deeply committed to our community, and we love the spontaneous combustion of combining neighborhood groups, bands, dance groups, artists, Mardi Gras Indians, buskers, businesses, cheerleaders, bike sculptures and random locals with Fringe performers from all over the county, and indeed the world!
 

 
And we are equally committed to keeping it free and accessible for as long as we can. We absolutely adore the fact that just about everyone can be in our parades -- the spirit of New Orleans abounds and abides.

Other Ways You Can Help
We know that everyone can't afford to contribute financially to every good cause. But there are still many ways to help!
 
* Email, tweet, like us on Facebook! We've provided all the links right here.
* Come to one of our throw parties, and help us fulfill our rewards!
* Let us know if you have extra art supplies or dolls you want to give us!
* Be in the parade! (Just email us, and we'll tell you how.)
 
Most of all, tell everyone you know to check us out and come to the parade. That's what this is all about! THANK  YOU!!!",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Janet Cole Valdez is a Gold Record
songwriter and award-winning musical theatre writer.  Deedee O’Malley is a multi-award winning
quadruple threat:  singer, songwriter,
actress and dancer.  Over the years, we
have laughed ourselves silly (and cried ourselves crazy) over the strange
adventures we’ve had in the entertainment industry.  We’ve decided to put the laughter and tears
into a new musical, starring Deedee as
New York actress Rita Donatella, and her desperate attempts to land a role in a Johnny Depp film! </span></h4>

ABOUT THE SHOW
Janet Cole Valdez is a Gold Record
songwriter and award-winning musical theatre writer.  Deedee O’Malley is a multi-award winning
quadruple threat:  singer, songwriter,
actress and dancer.  Over the years, we
have laughed ourselves silly (and cried ourselves crazy) over the strange
adventures we’ve had in the entertainment industry.  We’ve decided to put the laughter and tears
into a new musical, starring Deedee as
New York actress Rita Donatella, and her desperate attempts to land a role in a Johnny Depp film! 

After finishing the script and
songs, we brought in world class arranger and composer Bettie Ross to join our
creative team!  Click on “GALLERY” above,

<p><strong>Season 9: Empires Collapsing</strong></p>
<p>In December 2009, Greece admits its debts have reached 300 billion Euros- the highest in modern history. As the European Central Bank scrambles to keep Greece afloat, member countries experience crippling debt and the Euro-Zone crisis threatens to destroy the European Union. On December 18, 2010, a Tunisian activist lights himself on fire. This event instigates a wave of intense civil uprisings across the Middle East that comes to be known as The Arab Spring. On September 17, 2011, thousands of protesters descend on Zuccotti Park in New York’s financial district speaking out against wealth inequality and government corruption. The movement sweeps across the U.S. sparking ongoing protests nationwide.</p>
<p><strong>Leaders forced from power. Alliances shaken. Populations that can’t be silenced. The powers, systems and structures that we trust, rely on and perpetuate are failing us. Empires are collapsing. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Skriker </strong><strong>by Caryl Churchill</strong><br/> September 13 to October 20 <br/> directed by Eric Hoff</p>
<p>An ancient shapeshifter, hell-bent on destroying the lives of two impressionable young mothers, unleashes an army of folklore creatures. THE SKRIKER is Churchill’s visionary exploration of global ecology made through gender, storytelling, distorted language and modern urban life. Red Tape Theatre presents THE SKRIKER, a haunting fairytale by Caryl Churchill, directed by Eric Hoff, director of The Inconvenience’s critically-acclaimed production of Hit the Wall.</p>
<p><strong>Stadium Devildare </strong><strong><br/></strong>by Ruth Margraff<br/> January 17 to February 24 <br/> directed by Karen Yates</p>
<p>“In ancient gladiator style, and based on polls from viewers like yourselves, we have relocated our most patriotic finale to one of America’s actual war zones. During these events you will witness five of your favorites battle to defeat each other for the highest honor.” Don’t miss the sporting event of the year as Reiko throws down with the boys for the ultimate prize, which has nothing to do with a trophy. Karen Yates directs this Chicago premiere that questions love, power and loyalty against the backdrop of world war.</p>
<p><strong>Lear </strong><strong>by Young Jean Lee<br/></strong>May 9 to June 23 <br/> directed by James D Palmer</p>
<p>It’s King Lear. But there’s no King Lear. Experimental playwright and Doris Duke Artist Award winner Young Jean Lee has penned a whimsical and psychologically disturbing look at a world in which the pater familias is noticeably absent. The children are left to run the show but they must first overcome their anxiety and regret. As the story goes off the rails, Big Bird arrives to help us make sense of the madness. This is James D Palmer’s return to Lee’s work after CHURCH/PULLMAN, WA, one of Time Out Chicago’s Top Plays of 2011.</p>

By supporting our show, you make our dreams come true, bring this play to life, and jump-start the careers of some amazing artists. PLUS we're assembling some great perks by the day. With a donation to the show you can get a sitar lesson, a genre-bending performance, and more ... If you can dream it, we can probably make it happen. <br/></p>

Some Reviews: ""Minimal, yet lush. Simple, yet complex. It’s a mesmerizing experience."" - DC Theatre Scenehttp://dctheatrescene.com/2011/07/14/sanyasi/""Bordi and her production team have removed any extraneous visual or aural input, creating an atmosphere where the text and talented players are allowed to speak for themselves."" - DCisthttp://dcist.com/2011/07/capital_fringe_review_sanyasi.php""Sanyasi’s journey from zealot to skeptic comes off without a glitch"" - Washington City Paperhttp://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/fringe/2011/07/13/hip-shot-sanyasi/""The cast of this performance justifies the price of the Fringe ticket, especially Evan Sanderson"" - MD Theater Guidehttp://mdtheatreguide.com/2011/07/fringe-review-sanyasi/""Bordi’s production of Sanyasi should certainly be on anyone’s short list of plays to see at this year’s Fringe Festival. Sanyasi is a true, beautiful and complex stand out from the normal offerings"" - women around townhttp://www.womanaroundtown.com/sections/playing-around/sanyasi-a-quest-for-enlightenment
What We Need & What You Get
We're looking to cover the costs associated with entering two (two!!) festivals - the entrance fees, production costs, and advertising expenses to get the show up and get people to see it. By supporting our show, you make our dreams come true, bring this play to life, and jump-start the careers of some amazing artists. PLUS we're assembling some great perks by the day. With a donation to the show you can get a sitar lesson, a genre-bending performance, and more ... If you can dream it, we can probably make it happen. 


The DC Show: 
In DC: also staring Nikki Massoud, Nora Achrati, Amie Cazel, Thony Mena, Betsy Rosen, Vishal Vaidya

<h3>What is Tomfoolery?</h3>
</div>
<div>Tomfoolery Theatre Inc. began as a small group of young people with a passion for the performing arts &amp; a desire to make musical theatre accessible to more people in all walks of life with all levels of experience. By rehearsing just twice a week and keeping costs and resources to a minimum, year after year we manage to create theatre that comes straight from our hearts and touches many others'. <br/><br/>Visit <a href=""http://sites.google.com/site/tomfoolerytheatre/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">our website</a> to view more.</div>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<div>Guardian Angel Parish in Allendale, NJ has been kind enough to house Tomfoolery Theatre free of charge since our inception in 2009. However, there are many other costs associated with putting on a musical:</div>
<ul>
<li>Theatrical <span class=""messageBody""><span>licensing</span></span> fees</li>
<li>Rental materials</li>
<li>Insurance costs</li>

<li>Marketing</li>
<li>A million little unforeseen disasters!</li>
</ul><div>Every donation gets us closer to being able to cover one of these areas. Your support is what will make this show a success.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thus, we want to recognize you for your contribution! See ""Perks"" for an array of ways we'd like to honor you for your generosity.</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
Tomfoolery is not just a theatre group. After the devastating earthquake in 2010, we adopted The Rose Foundation of Haiti as our charity of choice. Since then, proceeds from each Tomfoolery production have gone toward aiding the impoverished people of Haiti. The more costs we can cover up front, the more we can ultimately give The Rose Foundation.

<h3>What Is Artist Magnet?</h3>
<p>* Artist Magnet is the theatre revolution, connecting Artists through Productions and Venues Everywhere.</p>
<p>* Through Artist Magnet, Artists will be able to build as many customized hyperlinking theatre resumes as they like to save, print, and share with their co-workers, family and friends.</p>
<p>* Through Artists' hyperlinking resumes, users will have the ability to (1) connect to the resumes of Directors those Artists have worked with (2) connect to the pages of their past, current and upcoming Productions (which will link to the hyperlinking resumes of all the Artists who worked in those Productions) and (3) connect to Venues they've worked in (which will link to the pages of all past, current and upcoming Productions in those Venues) - it's like a 6 (or 3.74) degrees of separation for the theatre community.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why Artist Magnet?</h3>
<p>* The difference between Artist Magnet and other sites is here Artists will generate and control the content and flow of their information - wiki style.  No more waiting for approval from web developers or production companies.</p>
<p>* Most importantly, the site is FREE for the Artists.  Instead of paying tons of money (which most Artists can't afford) to huge production companies for the opportunity to be seen (much less to get a job), those same corporate interests will now invest in gaining access to Artists' information.</p>
<p>* By connecting Artists, Directors, Productions and Venues on one network, Artist Magnet will help build connections and strengthen relationships among Artists, their audiences and their communities.</p>

<p>* We need $5,000 in funding for our web development team to build the next phase of the site and keep our servers from crashing (due to the site's popularity) - if we don't reach our total goal, funds will be allocated to add the hyperlinking technology feature to resumes.</p>

Then, ten years later, Hope is tracked down by a New York Times reporter who had interviewed her during her relief work. Hope reluctantly speaks about her struggle to reconcile those extraordinary experiences with her return to the ‘regular world’.

</div></div>","Our Story
Two Seul Productions is a Montreal based theatre Company created by Braulio Elicer (Centaur’s Comedy of Errors, Paradise by the River; winner of the CETM’s Le Spotlight 2008, Dome Graduate) David Sklar (Persephone’s Henry V, Concordia Theatre’s Scorched, Assistant Director at the Stratford Shakespeare School) and Nico Racicot(NTS Grad-2012) These actors decided to rejoin forces after their successfully sold-out and 2008 Mecca Nominated Fringe Show, This Hour Has 88 Years.

This year they are presenting ""Crazy Love"", a one-act play written and directed by David Sklar and winner of the 2010 Kit Brennan Award for Best Play at the Montreal Fringe Festival at MainLine Theatre.  

BASED ON A TRUE STORY   


 A funny, smart and scary play - it's a roller coaster ride about one of those 
relationships you always knew you should get out of, once and for all, but never got around to.  After this, you won't forget” –Kit Brennan 




What is the play about?



Leo has just been freed from a rocky relationship and is set
to restart his life with his new love. That is until his ex, Rebecca, shows up
unannounced to reveal that she is pregnant with their “love” child. Tension
ensues, past grudges are rehashed and both parties stop at nothing to win back
their life, even at the expense of their furniture. Both are forced to take a
deep and honest look into each other’s hearts. Dead baby jokes included!

We go from the twisted trauma-drama of a 14 year old girl to a show about potential from the point of view of a young boy, an egg, and a radio show host. In order to get these shows on their feet, we are looking to raise $500 to supply props, set pieces, costumes, posters and press, as well as provide payment to our technical crew. These shows are about a year in progress, Patience having begun development in a workshop last summer and The Egg Show beginning soon after. This dynamic duo of actor/writer/director/students has been supported by their awesome co-director, Michael Dreger, and a technical team including Huntington Filson and Matt Ray, all students or alum of Cornish College of the Arts. Together we accomplished a successful staged reading this past spring and hope to be able to share this show many times over with your help! Come see us perform for free September 3rd-5th in 102 (the black box space) at Cornish College of the Arts' main campus center! More information will also become available on our facebook page. <br/>Thank you for your support!!</p></div>","The Core Ensemble presents a weekend of two one-act solo performances: Clara Hayes' ""Patience is Understanding"" and Spencer Funk's ""The Egg Show"".

<p><strong><u>About
the Show:</u></strong></p>
<p><em>Gearhead
and the Realbot </em>is a wacky, science fiction
comedy and playwright Bob Simpson’s homage to awesome, terrible, and terribly
awesome science fiction films and television shows, particularly from the 1950s
and 60s.  The play takes us through a day in the lives of the crew of the
spaceship, Pomegranate Fizz, as they explore the galaxy and try desperately to
not blow themselves up.  The show contains a smorgasbord of goofy
characters, from the inept and overly-masculine captain, to the shell-shocked
first mate, to the gentle but probably an axe murderer doctor, to her sweet and
annoying son…you know, the one the producers put on the show to appeal to kids
but actually appeals to your carnal desire to see a child run over by an Abrams
tank.  And don’t forget the villain, whose desire to take over the
universe is rooted in the fact that…I don’t know…it’s Wednesday?  Lots of
laughs, lots of cool special effects, and a sock puppet…<em>Gearhead and the Realbot</em>has it all. </p>

Festival consisting of original and established one-act plays, and Lysistrata, A Re-Imagining. The Unknown Artists’ mission is to provide opportunities for talented, unknown individuals to thrive on a stage, enabling them to show off their gifts of music, acting, dance, comedy, film, and all categories of art. After the success of the above mentioned productions, we know how instrumental our supporters are to achieving the highest production level possible. The funds raised during this campaign will go directly to necessities such as theater rental, promotional materials, rehearsal space, costumes, props, and... wait for it... booze for intermission. Yes, booze for intermission. Our new location in Hollywood is pro-booze. Pro. Booze. (Check out our perks in the right sidebar!) Thank you in advance for your donation!Where can I find out more about the show, you ask? Check out details below!

About
the Show:
Gearhead
and the Realbot is a wacky, science fiction
comedy and playwright Bob Simpson’s homage to awesome, terrible, and terribly
awesome science fiction films and television shows, particularly from the 1950s
and 60s.  The play takes us through a day in the lives of the crew of the
spaceship, Pomegranate Fizz, as they explore the galaxy and try desperately to
not blow themselves up.  The show contains a smorgasbord of goofy
characters, from the inept and overly-masculine captain, to the shell-shocked
first mate, to the gentle but probably an axe murderer doctor, to her sweet and
annoying son…you know, the one the producers put on the show to appeal to kids
but actually appeals to your carnal desire to see a child run over by an Abrams
tank.  And don’t forget the villain, whose desire to take over the
universe is rooted in the fact that…I don’t know…it’s Wednesday?  Lots of
laughs, lots of cool special effects, and a sock puppet…Gearhead and the Realbothas it all.

<p>Our primary show is <i><strong>Antigone na h’Éireann, </strong></i>a brand new adaptation of the myth set in post-Brexit Northern Ireland. </p>
<p><i>Driven by faith to resurrect the IRA, Annie battles to bring her family the honour they deserve. A new Northern Irish adaptation of the myth by multi award-winning writer James Beagon.</i></p>
<p><i>In the not too distant future, a hard-border Brexit has severed Ireland in two once and for all. Annie and her siblings will not let this stand. An unshakeable shadow lingers over their journey as faith, family and factions collide: the shadow of their father and the memory of the Disappeared.</i></p>
<p><i>A fresh take on the story, inspired by Sophocles and other sources.</i></p>
<p><i><strong>Antigone na h’Éireann</strong><i> </i></i>is being performed at the <strong>Edinburgh Fringe</strong> from <strong>3rd-26th August</strong>, <strong>6pm</strong> at <strong>Paradise in the Vault</strong>. We are also seeking to bring it to the <strong>Buxton Fringe </strong>and <strong>Greater Manchester Fringe </strong>in July.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>What We Need</u></h2>
<p>We are looking to raise £2000 to help cover the following costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<u><strong>Venue Fees</strong> &amp; </u><strong><u>Fringe Registration</u> - </strong>despite being based in Edinburgh, it is almost prohibitively expensive to put on a show in our home city. We are only able to produce one show at a paid venue (<i><strong>Antigone na h’Éireann)<i> </i></strong></i>whilst our second (<strong><i>Shakespeare Catalysts)</i></strong> is only possible because of the Free Festival. On top of that, two shows means two Edinburgh registration fees. We are also seeking to take <i><strong>Antigone na h’Éireann</strong></i> to Buxton &amp; Greater Manchester, which means yet more registration &amp; venue fees.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong><u>Travel &amp; Accommodation for Buxton &amp; Greater Manchester</u> </strong>- Though we have created award-winning work of a high standard, we operate as an amateur company as we do not have anywhere near the resources to pay any of cast or crew a living wage. That said, we maintain a policy of making sure that we reimburse as many expenses as possible to ensure that nobody loses money by being part of the show. With that in mind, we intend to cover all of our cast &amp; crew travel &amp; accommodation fees for Buxton &amp; Greater Manchester.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>What You Get</u></h2>
<p>Our primary perk structure is very simple. For every<strong> £30</strong> raised, we pledge to run <strong>a free hour of youth theatre workshops</strong> for local children in the Edinburgh &amp; Lothians area.</p>
<p>You can either choose to donate this hour (or more!) to <strong>a specific Edinburgh local school or community group </strong>of your choosing <strong>or </strong>you can donate the time in general. </p>
<p>(Although if you would like to buy time for a specific group outside of that area, please get in touch and we'll see what we can do!)</p>
<p>For all hours not donated to a specific school/group, we will split these across a number of <strong>completely free</strong> youth theatre workshops over the course of 2018 and beginning of 2019. These will be split across the following age groups: 5-7, 8-10, 11-13 and 14-16.</p>
<p>These will be led by professional youth theatre tutor, company founder &amp; award-winning director-playwright James Beagon, who currently works freelance with both <strong>Strange Town Theatre Company </strong>and <strong>East Lothian Youth Theatre</strong>.</p>
<p>On top of this, our perks also include the opportunity to get the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Free Tickets to <i><strong>Antigone na h’Éireann</strong></i>.</li>
<li>Aulos Productions mugs and t-shirts.</li>
<li>Signed posters of both shows by the cast &amp; crew</li>
<li>And more!</li>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>The Impact</u></h2>
<p>By donating to our campaign, you will be making a real impact for children from families with deprived backgrounds. Youth Theatre tuition can be very expensive and access to drama through the school curriculum is incredibly limited.</p>
<p>Arts funding in Scotland is currently in crisis. Groups like <strong>Scottish Youth Theatre, Birds in Paradise </strong>and <strong>Lung Ha </strong>have all recently suffered at the hands of Creative Scotland. When even groups at the top of the Scottish theatre world are in trouble, it means that crowdfunding and regular fundraising events are the only way for groups like Aulos to exist.</p>
<p>By supporting this campaign, you not only make it possible for us to share our work with a wide audience but to produce our work at all.</p>

</div></div>","Who are we?
Aulos Productions is a multi award-winning Edinburgh theatre group, led by director, writer and youth theatre tutor James Beagon.
We have been operating in Edinburgh since 2014, producing award-winning and award-nominated shows including:


Gobland for the Goblins!  (Winner of Best Children's Show, Edinburgh Fringe 2017 - The Derek Awards; ★★★★★ , Families Edinburgh)

First Class (Winner of Best New Writing, Buxton Fringe 2014; ★★★★ – Edinburgh Reporter), 

Women of the Mourning Fields (★★★★ – Fringe Guru,  ★★★★ - Broadway Baby , ★★★★ - All Edinburgh Theatre; Nominated – Best Production, Buxton Fringe Festival 2015) 

Lest We Forget (★★★★ – Broadway Baby; Nominated – Best Production & Best New Writing, Buxton Fringe Festival 2016).


What's the campaign for?
This year, we are producing two brand new shows for the Edinburgh, Buxton & Greater Manchester Fringes, Antigone na h’Éireann and The Shakespeare Catalysts.
Antigone na h’Éireann
Our primary show is Antigone na h’Éireann, a brand new adaptation of the myth set in post-Brexit Northern Ireland. 
Driven by faith to resurrect the IRA, Annie battles to bring her family the honour they deserve. A new Northern Irish adaptation of the myth by multi award-winning writer James Beagon.
In the not too distant future, a hard-border Brexit has severed Ireland in two once and for all. Annie and her siblings will not let this stand. An unshakeable shadow lingers over their journey as faith, family and factions collide: the shadow of their father and the memory of the Disappeared.
A fresh take on the story, inspired by Sophocles and other sources.
Antigone na h’Éireann is being performed at the Edinburgh Fringe from 3rd-26th August, 6pm at Paradise in the Vault. We are also seeking to bring it to the Buxton Fringe and Greater Manchester Fringe in July.

The Shakespeare Catalysts
Our second show is The Shakespeare Catalysts, an exploration of ""change"" in the modern world through a collection of different Shakespearean scenes.
""Abide the change of time."" Cymbeline II.4.
Multi award-winning company (‘Gobland for the Goblins!’ ★★★★★, Families Edinburgh) explores “change” through a timely re-imagining of Shakespeare’s better and lesser known works in the wake of our current social and political upheavals.
Through starkly different scenes from his folios, we challenge audiences to question “change” in our modern world, whether it be something as intimate as the loss of a loved one at old age or the political shake-ups rocking both Europe and the rest of the world.
The Shakespeare Catalysts is being performed at the Edinburgh Fringe as part of the Free Festival from 20th-26th August, 8pm at Espionage (Mata Hari room).

<h3>Our Fourth Festival happens May 29th - June 2nd, 2019!</h3>
<p>We are excited to be presenting the festival again this year. We've had over 250 performers in the last three festivals, presenting both newer and established industry professionals. We have burlesque, sideshow, and the variety arts represented at the festival. This year we are partnering with The Southern Sideshow Hootenanny to bring information about the Carnaval Girls that toured with Girlie Shows in the Carnaval and highlight our variety and sideshow partners.</p>
<p>HI! I'm Lili VonSchtupp, founder of the Hollywood Burlesque Festival in 2013. I've produced over 700 burlesque shows, a gallery photography show, and have toured and headlined festivals throughout the United States. I also run Lili's School for Wayward Girls, a higher education school for burlesque. This year we are growing the festival to include all of southern California. </p>
<p>Festivals are not a huge money makers. We work within the community to bring a niche art form out from the shadows. It's a community event without major corporate sponsors, that's why we need you. We have a great community in Los Angeles and this event brings producers and performers together in one weekend to educate and entertain the public about that we do.</p>
<ul><li>Your contrabutions provide the cash flow before ticket sales to get this event off the ground.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>We Need To Fund This &amp; You Need Cool Stuff</h3>
<p>How are you really helping?</p>
<ul>
<li>Our venue and production costs are about 6k. We bring in lighting and equipment to create a top production event, and we need insurance too. </li>
<li>People love our artwork. Daisy Church created our original Hollywood Showgirls and they are working hard to raise money for us! Take one or all of them home with you, even if you can't attend you can support this event and art locally!</li>
<li>All the money raised will go back into the expense of the festival. Venue rental, lighting, sound equipment, media walls, programming, marketing, class room rental, and we provide food to the performers when they perform, you could actually be feeding a hungry artist! </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Have you ever wanted to be a part of something bigger than just you?</p>
<ul>
<li>Burlesque is an art form for the people. Shows have cover charges from free to $25. It's a relatively inexpensive art to experience but an expensive art to make happen. It celebrates artists, not limited by their sex, sexual preference, shape, color or disabilty. In fact, I'm 53 and disabled and still perform. </li>
<li>We've made this event happen three times now. For our fourth event we are directly asking for your help!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The festival is three nights in two cities. Weather and art are fickle. We've sold out three times but there is always the chance this weekend night have issues and people stay home. But with your support, the show will go on whether it be sold out or as an intimate event. </p>
<ul><li>We understand we want all the perks and all the bells and whistles! We want our performers to feel loved and valued, yet we know if all the money needed doesn't come in, some things just won't happen. Programs might be smaller, gift bags could be lighter, but we can and have done so much with our  partners working hard to fill them. With your help we can stay on our timeline, cut costs by making early purchases rather than rush orders, and really make this a stellar event. </li></ul>

Check out the FAQ at the bottom of the page!)Who Is The Cat?      Cappy! A lil' rascal dedicated to mischief, curiosity and exploration. What Our Theatre Is      HAT came together through discussions of weird ideas the founders had, ideas that were too outlandish, too theatrical, too risky, too exciting to ignore. We have compiled these ideas into our first season of theatre to share with the Atlanta community!             IDEAS LIKE:Abortion Road Trip – September 2019. A staged reading of Rachel Lynett's award-winning play about two sisters who take a taxi from San Antonio to New Mexico to get an abortion. A portion of the proceeds will go to support reproductive justice in Georgia. 8 p.m. Wed., Sept. 4 at The Bakery.Hold On To Your Hats - November 2019. Ten Atlanta playwrights. Ten plays. Ten minutes long. One prompt: Write an Impossible play. Featuring plays by well-known Atlanta playwrights and performers: Mark Kendall, Suehyla El-Attar, Nick Tecovsky, Jon Carr and Addae Moon, alongside rising writers on the scene: Caleigh Derreberry, Wade Lawrence Hollomon, Slokha Krishnan, Esther Lang Reeves and Bryce Irvin. 8 p.m. Thur.-Sun., Nov. 14-17 at Synchronicity Theatre.A Hamlet – Spring 2020.  A full production of Hamlet where a different audience member plays the titular character every night. No rehearsal, no prep time, just diving headfirst into Denmark. How universal is the most universal story? Come on down and choose 2 be (or not)!A World Premiere Play by Anterior Leverett - Summer, 2020. We commissioned Atlanta-playwright Anterior Leverett to write an Atlanta-specific play for our inaugural season. That's the outlook. 13 plays. One big year. What We Need & What You Get: What Your Contributions CoverSpace! The majority of the money from our Indiegogo will help us secure rehearsal and performance space in Atlanta venues both familiar and strange.Artists!

<p><i>Two nerds, Griff

popular girls in school. Despite the objections of their longtime goth friend
Hemlock (who has a crush on Griff ), Griff and Kemper hatch a plan to win the
twins: Make themselves more popular using science. But when a serum meant to
clear Griff's acne turns him invisible, all seems lost. That is, until Griff
uses his invisibility to help Kemper beat Chetwick, the school's bully, in a
fight, which sends the school abuzz about Kemper.  Kemper goes mad with power and betrays Griff.</i></p>

<h3>About <i>Readymade</i>
</h3>
<p>Conveying the power of perspective and appreciation, ka·nei·see | collective presents Readymade, an evening-length dance inspired by Marcel Duchamp's art theory by the same title. An hour long, the show involves ten performers, commissioned costume and lighting design, original choreography by Tanya Chianese, and hundreds of rolls of toilet paper.</p>
<p>In 1917 Duchamp turned a porcelain urinal on its side at an esteemed exhibition and titled it Fountain. He did nothing to the object except present it for contemplation. The infuriated art world argued that dignifying commonplace objects did not make them works of art. Duchamp's actions prompted a philosophical movement that challenged society's idea of what art should be and how we view the world.</p>
<p>Now a century later as society becomes reliant on our technological existence, Duchamp's theory of the readymade is relevant today more than ever; it reminds us to acknowledge our surroundings, and in turn our lives, with a positive, open-minded lens. Readymade is not about Duchamp's work, but instead aims to invoke his iconic idea of do-it-yourself power to reshape one's own life by changing how we view things.   </p>

</div><div><h3>About the Budget</h3></div><div>
<p>Our budget for <i>Readymade </i>is $15,260.</p>

<p>This project is supported by the Phyllis C. Wattis Foundation, the Lighting Artists in Dance grant (a program of Dancers’ Group), and individual donors. Additionally, we anticipate selling out and we are factoring ticket sales into our income.</p>
<p>However, we are still $1,500 away from reaching our goal. We hope you will consider supporting contemporary dance and bridging this gap for the present and future.</p>

<h3>About ka·nei·see | collective</h3>

Readymade is not about Duchamp's work, but instead aims to invoke his iconic idea of do-it-yourself power to reshape one's own life by changing how we view things.   

About the Budget
Our budget for Readymade is $15,260.
This includes: Theater Rental $3,500, Personnel $7,300, Costumes and Props $1,400, Marketing & Publicity $1,019, Receptions $181, Rehearsal Space $1,860
This project is supported by the Phyllis C. Wattis Foundation, the Lighting Artists in Dance grant (a program of Dancers’ Group), and individual donors. Additionally, we anticipate selling out and we are factoring ticket sales into our income.
However, we are still $1,500 away from reaching our goal. We hope you will consider supporting contemporary dance and bridging this gap for the present and future.

About ka·nei·see | collective
ka·nei·see | collective debuted its first home season, Cookie Cutter, to sold-out audiences and a front page cover story of the SF Chronicle's 96 Hours that read “accessible and provocative, as well as unafraid to meld innovation with time-honored dance conventions.” (Nirmala Nataraj, Jan 2015). Launched in 2014, ka·nei·see | collective is a Bay Area performing arts ensemble directed by Tanya Chianese creating vitalizing, accessible contemporary dance that promotes finding humor, appreciation, compassion, awareness, and celebration in our increasingly technological existence. The company has been presented at various venues including ODC Theater, Z Space, Joe Goode Annex, Shawl-Anderson Dance Center, Dance Mission Theater, Fort Mason Center, and Yerba Buena Gardens, as well as toured to Los Angeles. The recipient of two audience choice awards, ka·nei·see | collective has presented in many festivals notably SF International Arts Festival, West Wave Dance Festival, RAWdance’s CONCEPT series, and SPF.
“If you’re in the area, go see it and if you’re not, make a special trip. Tanya Chianese and ka·nei·see | collective are important players in the emerging contemporary dance scene.”  -Heather Desaulniers, Critical Dance, Jan 2015

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello All!</p>
<p>This production of The Importance of Being Earnest is a project that is close to my heart. In the Fall of 2017, I began a journey of directing Bye Bye Birdie for Asbury University's annual musical presented by the sophomore class. During this time, I discovered my love of directing and storytelling that gets to the heart of human nature: all of our mistakes, all of our triumphs and joys, and everything in between that makes us relate to and understand one another. Because I found a passion in theatre in a new way, I sought after another project as soon as I possibly could, and The Importance of Being Earnest fell into my open hands as a personal project. Throughout the process of putting this show together in two and a half weeks, I have been grown and stretched as an individual and artist and seen my cast and crew rise to the challenge to assist me and my passion to create a unique version of this classic show. As time draws near to opening our doors, we ask that you consider joining us in our journey and helping us get our feet on the stage, ready to go. </p>

<p>I am the creator, founder and visionary of JuxtaPosition Dance Theatre (JPDT). I am also the mother of a happy, energetic, and smart-allec 11 month old baby girl.  Having my own dance company and producing/directing a show of my choreography has been a dream of mine since I began dancing as a child and after our little one was born, I realized that in order to teach her that she can reach her dreams, I needed to have the courage to pursue my own. So I decided to take the plunge and began founding JPDT.  Together with our dancers we are bringing to life ""Kinetic Interludes,"" our first full-length evening dance concert dealing with themes ranging from body image struggles to social greed, but we can't do it alone.</p>
<p><strong>A little bit about me: </strong></p>
<p>I received my B.A. in Theater Arts &amp; Dance, with an emphasis in Dance from CSU, Los Angeles. Upon completion of my collegiate studies, I spent some time in France with the M.A.D.E. in France program where I trained with David Dorfman Dance, Lisa Race, Liz Claire, and Libertivore Dance Theatre. I have also had the opportunity to work with and train with artists such as Hae Lee of Hae Kyung Lee &amp; Dancers, Holly Johnston of Ledges &amp; Bones, Rebeca Hernandez, C. Derrick Jones III  of Catch Me Bird, and many more. In winter of 2010 I choreographed, co-wrote, produced and starred in my first dance for film production entitled ""Silenced Dreams,"" which I created as a social awareness project for the Women of Juarez Femicides; an issue that I am deeply impassioned by. In late 2012 I was given the opportunity to dance under the direction of Rebeca Hernandez for the annual Day of the Dead Celebration at the Los Angeles Hollywood Cemetary. <br/><br/></p>
<p><strong>About our project:</strong></p>
<p>With ""Kinetic Interludes,"" we will present an evening of dynamic, athletic, highly physical and highly emotive choreography that examines our everyday lives, ourselves, the way we love, and the world beyond our front door through the eyes of the femenine perspective.  Our show touches issues ranging from body image and female objectification to social greed and everyday interactions in our humanity. We seek to make dances that create contrast within concepts, music, and movement.  The choreography we are most drawn to is that which pushes limits, derives inspiration from unlikely places, and blooms from confined spaces.</p>
<p>As an emerging dance company we seek to create performance opportunities for dancers of all ages, backgrounds, and abilities. We thrive in the bodies of the unexpected dancer and we desire to depict both the pain &amp; joy in our humanity through our movement.</p>
<p>Furthermore, our mission is to bring modern and contemporary dance to underprivileged youths in low-income neighborhoods. This concert is the first step toward accomplishing our vision and you have the power to make it a reality.</p>
<p><strong>What your donation will contribute:</strong></p>

<h3> </h3></span></div>","HELLO!
I am the creator, founder and visionary of JuxtaPosition Dance Theatre (JPDT). I am also the mother of a happy, energetic, and smart-allec 11 month old baby girl.  Having my own dance company and producing/directing a show of my choreography has been a dream of mine since I began dancing as a child and after our little one was born, I realized that in order to teach her that she can reach her dreams, I needed to have the courage to pursue my own. So I decided to take the plunge and began founding JPDT.  Together with our dancers we are bringing to life ""Kinetic Interludes,"" our first full-length evening dance concert dealing with themes ranging from body image struggles to social greed, but we can't do it alone.
A little bit about me: 
I received my B.A. in Theater Arts & Dance, with an emphasis in Dance from CSU, Los Angeles. Upon completion of my collegiate studies, I spent some time in France with the M.A.D.E. in France program where I trained with David Dorfman Dance, Lisa Race, Liz Claire, and Libertivore Dance Theatre. I have also had the opportunity to work with and train with artists such as Hae Lee of Hae Kyung Lee & Dancers, Holly Johnston of Ledges & Bones, Rebeca Hernandez, C. Derrick Jones III  of Catch Me Bird, and many more. In winter of 2010 I choreographed, co-wrote, produced and starred in my first dance for film production entitled ""Silenced Dreams,"" which I created as a social awareness project for the Women of Juarez Femicides; an issue that I am deeply impassioned by. In late 2012 I was given the opportunity to dance under the direction of Rebeca Hernandez for the annual Day of the Dead Celebration at the Los Angeles Hollywood Cemetary. 
About our project:
With ""Kinetic Interludes,"" we will present an evening of dynamic, athletic, highly physical and highly emotive choreography that examines our everyday lives, ourselves, the way we love, and the world beyond our front door through the eyes of the femenine perspective.  Our show touches issues ranging from body image and female objectification to social greed and everyday interactions in our humanity. We seek to make dances that create contrast within concepts, music, and movement.  The choreography we are most drawn to is that which pushes limits, derives inspiration from unlikely places, and blooms from confined spaces.
As an emerging dance company we seek to create performance opportunities for dancers of all ages, backgrounds, and abilities. We thrive in the bodies of the unexpected dancer and we desire to depict both the pain & joy in our humanity through our movement.
Furthermore, our mission is to bring modern and contemporary dance to underprivileged youths in low-income neighborhoods. This concert is the first step toward accomplishing our vision and you have the power to make it a reality.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.draft89.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""draft89"">draft89 Theatre Collective</a> has been producing original Canadian interdisciplinary theatre since 2003.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><i>Islands</i> is a new play by long-time collective member Graham Porter.  Set in the distant future, it looks at the clash between utopia and human nature.  Are people entitled to their bad ideas?  Are people free to relinquish their freedom?  When the mob is at the gate, does it matter if they're right or wrong?  When your opponent plays dirty, when do you climb down into the dirt with them?  All this, plus holograms, radioactive sunflowers, anti-ageing medicine and big hats will be on display in two-hour installments starting May 17, 2012.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Original live theatre is hard.  Space is expensive, lots of people are required, and you'd like to pay everyone <i>something</i> for their time, even though there's so little money to go around.  So why do we still do it?</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Maybe we're nuts.  Maybe...no, we're nuts.  But if you've got the theatre bug, you just have to do it.  So here we are, after nine years and seven shows, getting ready to do it all over again.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>For all that film and television provide, there's still one thing they can't do (yet).  They can't put you in the room.  That's something draft89 tries to do with every show - put the audience right in the action, nose to nose with the performers, and make them feel like they're a part of what's going on.  That's what we did when we turned <i><a href=""http://www.draft89.com/past-productions/foe-aug-2007"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""FOE"">FOE</a> </i>(2007) into a living art gallery.  That's what we did when we rebuilt John and Yoko's Montreal hotel room for <i><a href=""http://www.draft89.com/past-productions/johnyoko-bed-piece-dec-2009"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""John/Yoko Bed Piece"">John/Yoko Bed Piece</a></i> (2009).  And that's what we'll do with <i>Islands</i>, when we treat the audience to front-row seats to the end of the world, and to what came after.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Right now we're $8000 away from being able to open - our performance space, rehearsal space and insurance all need to be paid for up-front.  Once that's handled, we will use any overflow funds to improve the quality of our sets, costumes and video projection.  The goal is for the show to be debt-free on opening night.  If we can reach that goal, then 100% of the ticket sales can go to paying the cast and crew.  These fine people will have put in months of hard work by the time the show closes, and we want to give them as much financial compensation as we can.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Oh, and don't forget the perks.  Please see the sidebar for all the fabulous prizes you'll win for helping us reach our goal.</p>

search for The Origin of Love, inspiring anyone who has felt life gave them an

smash also won multiple awards for its hit film adaptation.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/353582/files/20140206114309-Hedwig379_-_Version_2.jpg?1391715789"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FUDMLYYUW3ZU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DUDMLYYUW3ZU&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FUDMLYYUW3ZU%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<h3>The Theatre</h3>
<p><span>This
production of Hedwig and the Angry Inch will take place at New Venture Theatre,
a charity theatre based in Brighton, East Sussex and run entirely by
volunteers. It has won several local awards for the high quality of its productions. The NVT was founded over fifty years ago to </span>provide education and experience to anyone wanting to
get involved in theatre and to bring affordable performing arts to the local community.</p>
<h3>The Festival</h3>
<p>Brighton Fringe is the largest arts festival in England and one of the
largest fringe festivals in the world. It sets out to stimulate, educate and
entertain a wide audience by providing a showcase for diverse art forms.
Everyone can take part, in fact, whilst enjoying a friendly and supportive
environment. And all this in an iconic city with unique cultural heritage.</p>
<h3>Why We Need Your Funding</h3>
<p>No matter what happens, New Venture Theatre’s Hedwig is going to be a
fantastic show. We already have a huge team of talented crew who have fallen in
love with it and casting auditions have gone even better than we could have
hoped. We now have an experienced cast with just the right mix of charisma,
comedy timing and musical talent.</p>
<p>But there are things we would like to add. NVT has excellent lighting
facilities for a small theatre, but we would like to add more – the kind of
lighting worthy of an ass-kicking band like The Angry Inch. Part of your
donation will pay for a high quality strobe light and other equipment to give
that extra oomph.</p>
<p>We always enjoy being part of Brighton Fringe Festival. It gets bigger
and better every year – but this does make it harder and harder for a modest
charity theatre to be noticed amongst the other big shows. Part of your
donation will go towards making sure that Hedwig and the Angry Inch get the
audience and recognition that they deserve.</p>
<p>There are lots of other things we could bolster too. We have plans for
a very stylish set – part of your donation will go towards making it even
better. We have a band who will most definitely rock your world – part of your donation will go towards giving them some extra studio rehearsal time.</p>
<p>In order to produce this challenging show, and make it the best we can, we require additional funding to make the show truly outstanding.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/365531/files/20140212055039-Hedwig201_-_Version_3.jpg?1392213039"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

I said there are so many.  He said he wanted to write me a Ricky Roma... and in one way I can say he did, and Willy Loman and Stanley Kowalski too -- what all three of those men do share in common with Jack Gallo is that they will do anything towards achieving the American dream.   Unlike Jack, those great characters before him either destroy or get destroyed... Jack has maybe... just maybe one ounce... possibly an ounce of a chance towards redemption.""

Help support... DESTRUCTION!
We'd love for you to support our workshop production of Darren Debari's full-length play DESTRUCTION OF THE AMERICAN MALE which we are producing at Coastal Artists Productions, 66 South Main Street in Ocean Grove, NJ. on Friday, April 11 at 8pm; Saturday, April 12 at 2pm & 8pm; and Sunday, April 13 at 2pm.LaStrada Ensemble Theater is birthed as Jack Gallo meets his destruction this April.  Founders A.J. Ciccotelli, Darren Debari and Stephen Larsen form a new ensemble theater that focuses on local playwrights and talent.  
Jack
Gallo had it all – a promising career as an actor, a trophy wife, and all
the booze a young man could drink – then he lost it all. He takes a job as a
stockbroker, and starts to claw up the ladder to the American Dream again –
only to lose his footing and lose it all, again. Now, he wonders who he is –
where will he get his next drink – and what will he leave behind that matters?

Destruction of the American Male was first presented as a reading in April 2013 as a part of the reading series of Black Box of Asbury Park.  After a summer-long dramaturgical reworking, the play is ready for its first workshop production.   The workshop production will help us develop the play into a MainStage production.  We are planning to do two Q&A so audience feedback can help Darren further refine his play.               DESTRUCTION: Budget Needs             
Our budget is $1,500. This includes: set, props, costumes and rehearsal space.
Set, Props, Costumes: $1,000
$1,000 for set, props and costumes for the show.
Rehearsal Space:  $500

In fact, thanks to you we more than did it. Your generous donation, combined with that of 54 fellow supporters, raised $3,457 in 31 days. Meaning that together, we surpassed our original goal of $3,000. You’ve helped us grow National Choreography Month into a national organization with over 80 participating choreographers. </span><span style=""font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">We are so grateful for your support.</span><br/><br/><span style=""font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">It has been an exciting and eventful month of movement for our Nachmo participants. This year saw the creation of over 80 new dance works, including a piece inspired by The Trojan Women, a movement study of doors in New York, and a ballet to live guitar. We established a rockstar website where Nachmo Artists could share their work. And we brought in an Artists’ Committee to guide our growing organization. Your donations have helped make all of these new undertakings come to life. </span><br/><br/><span style=""font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">For each of the last three years we’ve hosted one evening of work under the guidance of 2 dancers and their friends. You are a major architect of our growth this year in providing funds to shore up our new infrastructure. This year, with the support of your contributions, we and our 15 member Artists’ Committee are thrilled to invite you to seven performances spread across three cities in which our intrepid choreographers present their world premieres to the public. If you received the Two Tickets perk from our campaign, then your name is already on our guest lists in every city.

We invite dancers to forge a new work in one month, from January 1st to 31st. Our framework expands artistic resources through live events, interactive blogging, and a community who expects completion. Many dancers have the inclination and the skills to make their own work, but are limited by the economics of time and funding. Nachmo breaks down that wall with the power of a deadline accompanied by an active community.</span></strong>

They admired the model used by National Novel Writing Month, and created a similar format to motivate themselves to put together new work. The event has grown each year, and already we have over 90 Nachmo 4 artists working on creating new pieces this January. </span></strong>

About NachmoNachmo spurs dancers to choreograph by challenging them with a deadline and supporting them with a community. We invite dancers to forge a new work in one month, from January 1st to 31st. Our framework expands artistic resources through live events, interactive blogging, and a community who expects completion. Many dancers have the inclination and the skills to make their own work, but are limited by the economics of time and funding. Nachmo breaks down that wall with the power of a deadline accompanied by an active community.

 

Who we areNachmo was conceived by dancers Sharyn Korey and Anna Brown Massey in 2009, when they felt they both needed a serious nudge to start making work. They admired the model used by National Novel Writing Month, and created a similar format to motivate themselves to put together new work. The event has grown each year, and already we have over 90 Nachmo 4 artists working on creating new pieces this January. 


Over our first three years we have been lucky to receive the generous donations of skills, smarts, and energy from fellow choreographers. Nachmo is now in its fourth year and it’s time to generate funds to support the phenomenal work of the Artists Board, the costs of our productions, and the power of publicity. Please join us in our strategic campaign to support us as we spur artists to creation through communal action. Your donation will support us for Nachmo 4 and to help us grow into the coming decade.What your support providesNachmo 4 is supported by a volunteer Artists Committee of 15 dancers who donate services in web design, copy editing, financial development, publicity outreach, graphic design, video editing, email marketing, and event planning. Whew! Their amazing generosity ensures that our costs remain radically low and we need only ask you for the minimum of support. Your donation will support us this January and help us grow into the coming decade.- Two nights rental of a dance theater with lighting designer: $1270- Fiscal non-profit sponsorship in 2013: $200- Rentals for 4 studio performances: $340- Stipend to members of Artists Committee: $750- Email marketing: $360- Studio rental for Choreography Feedback Sessions: $30- Website domain maintenance: $50Other Ways You Can Help:We understand that not everyone is able to make a financial contribution, but you can still help!

<p>On April 14, 2013 (the 101st anniversary of Titanic's sinking), PLAY Conservatory will perform <em>Escape From Titanic</em> at Albuquerque’s N4th Theater.</p>
<p>Based on the Senate Hearing transcripts and survivor accounts, <em>Escape From Titanic</em> is a memory play told through the eyes of J. Bruce Ismay, president of the White Star Line at the time of the disaster and himself a survivor of the wreck.  Now at the end of his life, he anguishes over his role in the catastrophe, as voices from the past torment him. </p>
<p>Nineteen young actors ages 11 to 18, who have been coached in ensemble work and various dialects, will play more than 70 roles.</p>
<p>This original play by Jonathan Dunski made its debut in 2012 with a production directed by Ryan Morris.  It is being developed specifically as a play for young audiences.</p>
<p>As much as $9,000 has already been invested in this play's development by PLAY Conservatory and the Albuquerque community.  We need your help to take it to the next level.</p>
<p>The plan for development includes:</p>

<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Help us spread the word!  Please share our indiegogo campaign with your networks.  If you know a “Titaniac” history buff, please tell him or her about this project.  It should also appeal to Drama teachers and producers of Youth Theater.</p>
<p>And, if you are in the Albuquerque area on April 14, please come see the show.  We hope to sell out!</p>
<p><strong>From the Director</strong></p>
<p>The role of the Dramatist has been defined as putting “ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.”  Even the greatest writer could not have imagined a story like the one that took place 100 years ago, when Titanic, the largest moving object in the world, sank 2.5 miles to the bottom of the sea, leaving 2,223 people to fight for their survival.  Each person’s story is extraordinary.  Perhaps that is why to this day we are still fascinated with the tragedy.  An inspiration for countless films, books, television shows, and Broadway musicals, Titanic has been rigorously studied and represented as both a work of history and numerous works of fiction based on history.</p>
<p>Writers of history have attempted to piece together a timeline of what actually happened that night – cause and effect – using primary documentation, including both written and oral accounts of passengers of the RMS Titanic.  The fictional representations of Titanic have attempted to fill in the gaps of what we don’t know.  What we do know is that there are two questions still debated a century later:  Why did so many people perish that night?  And who should be held accountable for it?</p>
<p>Our play asks these questions of its protagonist J. Bruce Ismay, CEO of the White Star Line, whom history has branded a coward for finding a place for himself in a lifeboat.  In our story Ismay is attempting to pass from his earthly life, but before he can, the spirits and voices of his fellow passengers must haunt him.  He is forced to recount his actions.  We are challenged to see the catastrophe through his eyes.</p>
<p>The passengers of Titanic would like to tell you their extraordinary stories.  As you witness them and consider judgment upon Mr. Ismay, I ask you to, please, “Be Mindful.”</p>

<p>From June 12<span><sup>th</sup></span> to 22<span><sup>nd</sup></span>, Cherylyn Lavagnino, Zvi Gotheiner and Dusan Tynek, three choreographers whose creative instincts are driven by music, will come together to present a new festival entitled <em>Musa</em>, at the Baruch Performing Arts Center Nagelberg Theatre. </p>
<p>For this festival, Cherylyn Lavagnino Dance is collaborating with violinist Jane Chung and cellist, Sarah Biber, to create an evocative new 45-minute ballet entitled ""Treize en Jeu"" for 13 dancers set to 3 movements of Franz Schubert's Piano Trio in E Flat Major for piano, violin, and cello that will be performed live on precious period instruments.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Facilitate the Collaboration</strong></p>
<p>Because the heart of a CLD ballet is woven into the music as much as it is woven into the movement, it is imperative to work with the most talented and soulful collaborators in both fields. CLD’s June season at Baruch Performing Arts Center is no different, and so we are looking to you to help us support this collaboration between CLD and American Virtuosi so that we can offer to you, our loyal audience and community, an evening that highlights the powers of music, dance, and the collaborative human spirit.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>""Treize en Jeu""...The New Ballet by CLD</strong></p>
<p>The collaboration between CLD, Jane Chung, and Sarah Biber in performing ""Treize en Jeu"" this June will go beyond standard live accompaniment. The musicians will be highlighted in this incomparable Romantic-era work played on period instruments, including a Broadwood 1829 fortepiano. Also on the program is a duet entitled “Compadre” with music by Astor Piazzolla, performed by JP Jofre on an early 20<span><sup>th</sup></span> century bandoneón. It is a rare opportunity to hear these works performed live on period instruments, and these pieces by CLD will be an even more unique experience as dance, live music and period instruments come together.</p>
<p>The complexity of Schubert’s Trio in E Flat Major has lead Lavagnino to create an intricate visual composition responding to the emotional and rhythmic shifts of this rich masterpiece. Although Lavagnino's choreography is typically abstract and emotional, this ballet will explore some of the classical character dance from London's Royal Academy of Dance, placing it more in the pure movement/music genre. This gives Lavagnino an opportunity to employ the engaging medium of classical ballet while remaining within the expressive genre of contemporary dance. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Any amount of support is greatly appreciated and will help us reach our goal of bringing to you engaging works of contemporary ballet with live music. We also hope you will join us at <em>Musa</em> this June at the Baruch Performing Arts Center to see what your support has helped us achieve. Thank you. </p>

<p><strong>Cherylyn Lavagnino Dance Mission Statement</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Cherylyn Lavagnino’s mission is to create movement that engages an audience by aligning the rigor of ballet with the humanistic performance values of contemporary dance.  Her choreography uses the physically limiting state of dancing “en pointe” as a platform to delve into the range of human interaction and emotion.  The exaggerated classical ballet form is directed to express sensitive and honest portrayals by her dancers.  Music is paramount to Lavagnino’s creative process and its influence pushes and prods her imagery. Live music is a hallmark.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Cherylyn Lavagnino Biography</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Cherylyn Lavagnino (Artistic Director/Choreographer)</strong> has an MFA in Dance from NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts, as well as a BA in Philosophy from USC. Lavagnino toured nationally as a soloist with the Pennsylvania Ballet.  She has performed a range of classical repertoire and contemporary work by choreographers including Balanchine, John Butler, Hans Van Manen, and Tere O’Connor, and the diversity of these experiences has informed the dialogue between classical and contemporary in her work with Cherylyn Lavagnino Dance.  Ms. Lavagnino has created over thirty works in the past fifteen years, and since 2000 the platform for her choreography has been Cherylyn Lavagnino Dance. Many of those works were created in collaboration with composers Scott Killian and Jane Chung. She regularly incorporates the performance of live music into her performances. The American Virtuosi, directed by Kenneth Hamrick and Ms. Lavagnino are developing a <em>Dance and Live Music</em> incentive to support their collaborative interests. Lavagnino’s choreography has been presented in New York City by Danspace Project at St. Mark’s Church, Dance Theater Workshop, Symphony Space, DanceNow/NYC, Kaatsban International Dance Center and The Joyce Theatre’s “Evening Stars” series. Ms. Lavagnino is a recipient of the Joyce Dutka Arts Foundation’s award for choreography and of a space grant residency from the Baryshnikov Arts Center and her choreography has been supported by the American Music Center’s Live Music for Dance grant and the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council’s Manhattan Creative Communities Fund.</p>
<p>Lavagnino is currently Chair of the Dance Department at NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts. She has been a full-time member of the NYU faculty since 1987. She teaches professional ballet locally in NYC and internationally; she is developing a creative exchange with the Beijing Dance Academy and Minzu University in Beijing. In recognition of her superior work, Lavagnino won New York University’s prestigious David Payne Carter Award for Excellence in Teaching in 2003.</p></div>","Musa, a new Festival and CLD's June Season in NYC

Lavagnino toured nationally as a soloist with the Pennsylvania Ballet.  She has performed a range of classical repertoire and contemporary work by choreographers including Balanchine, John Butler, Hans Van Manen, and Tere O’Connor, and the diversity of these experiences has informed the dialogue between classical and contemporary in her work with Cherylyn Lavagnino Dance.  Ms. Lavagnino has created over thirty works in the past fifteen years, and since 2000 the platform for her choreography has been Cherylyn Lavagnino Dance. Many of those works were created in collaboration with composers Scott Killian and Jane Chung. She regularly incorporates the performance of live music into her performances. The American Virtuosi, directed by Kenneth Hamrick and Ms. Lavagnino are developing a Dance and Live Music incentive to support their collaborative interests. Lavagnino’s choreography has been presented in New York City by Danspace Project at St. Mark’s Church, Dance Theater Workshop, Symphony Space, DanceNow/NYC, Kaatsban International Dance Center and The Joyce Theatre’s “Evening Stars” series. Ms. Lavagnino is a recipient of the Joyce Dutka Arts Foundation’s award for choreography and of a space grant residency from the Baryshnikov Arts Center and her choreography has been supported by the American Music Center’s Live Music for Dance grant and the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council’s Manhattan Creative Communities Fund.
Lavagnino is currently Chair of the Dance Department at NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts. She has been a full-time member of the NYU faculty since 1987. She teaches professional ballet locally in NYC and internationally; she is developing a creative exchange with the Beijing Dance Academy and Minzu University in Beijing. In recognition of her superior work, Lavagnino won New York University’s prestigious David Payne Carter Award for Excellence in Teaching in 2003.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

I also wondered about within an intercultural contexts (me as a Taiwanese who have been through a diverse cultural exposures and now living and making movement arts in American), how I interact with my surroundings (including people who inhabited in the surroundings) and carry myself through it.

By giving even a very small contribution you will help launching a project that aims to promote the growth of art inside and outside our ardours but beloved Palermo by helping artists in their professional development. Advertising costs varies a lot so every single cent can make the difference.But money is not the only way, you can still contribute and give your support by spreading the word with your friends and on social media!And don’t forget the Indiegogo  share tools! HELP US GROW          HELP PALERMO           HELP THE ARTS     Vuoi saperne di più?Mo.Re Open Space è un programma che punta ad implementare la danza contemporanea a Palermo, offrendo ad artisti internazionali uno spazio di residenza dove sviluppare i propri lavori coreografici.Agli artisti residenti verrà richiesto di condurre dei workshop; un’opportunità unica per i danzatori locali per continuare ad allenarsi, esplorare, mettersi alla prova e sviluppare una buona rete di contatti internazionali.Tutto questo sarà realizzabile grazie al tuo contributo.  Essendo un progetto interamente autofinanziato, abbiamo bisogno di supporto per pubblicizzare su giornali, siti di danza e, sì, anche su Facebook.Dando anche un piccolo contributo puoi aiutare nel lancio di un progetto che ha l’obbiettivo di promuovere l’arte all’interno e all’esterno della nostra ostica ma amata Palermo, aiutando gli artisti nella loro crescita professionale.Ogni singolo centesimo può fare la differenza.Ma i soldi non sono l’unica strada, puoi sempre contribuire e dare il tuo supporto spargendo la voce tra tuoi amici e sui social media!E non dimenticare gli Indiegogo share tools!AIUTACI A CRESCERE              AIUTA PALERMO        AIUTA L’ARTE",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><u>WHAT WE DO</u></h3>
<p>As students of a liberal arts college in the heart of New York City, we've had the extreme pleasure of participating in theoretical dialogues and embodied practices involving interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary performance. At present, we are each engaged in individual creative processes in a workshop setting facilitated by Neil Greenberg. These processes are the synthesis of our readings and research, our backgrounds and experiences, our influences and interests. We are dealing with a wide range of themes and problems in our works, such as identity, oddness, blackness, isolation, image-dominated culture, family history, pop music, and science fiction. The show we will be presenting, <i>In Real Time</i>, is either the beginning, middle, or end, of our explorations. It is not to be missed, as it is time-based and an will never happen again in quite the same way. </p>

<b>White</b> captures the imagination of children like no other theater show. Created by Andy Manley of the award-winning, internationally acclaimed children's theatre company Catherine Wheels, the world of <b>White</b> is full of birdsong and birdhouses. Two friends keep the eggs safe and make sure their world remains ordered, and most importantly, always <b>White</b>. Much to the two friends' shock and denial, color starts to appear... The public accompanies the friends in their initial struggle to reject that which is different and unexpected, until the eventual realization that different colors, <b>just like our differences, enrich our lives</b>.<br/>

</div></div>","About White 
White is a magnificent play for 2-4 year olds, created by Andy Manley from the Scottish theatre company Catherine Wheels. With over 975 performances worldwide, White makes its Latin American debut through Monterrey, Mexico. 

Date:  Saturday November 28 and Saturday November 29, 2015, at 4:30 pm


Location: Pabellón El Universo inside Planetario Alfa, in San Pedro, Monterrey, Mexico.


For every 3 tickets bought through the perks, 1 will be given to a child from a low-income family (La Ciudad de Los Niños). 



'...one of the great experiences of a lifetime... Thank you for the best 40 minutes of my life...' -Sarah-Jessica Parker



'an utter delight no matter your age.' -The Times
COMO COMPRAR TUS BOLETOS: A través de los perks (LADO DERECHO) compra cada boletos individualmente para la función elegida.

_____________________________________________________________________________






White captures the imagination of children like no other theater show. Created by Andy Manley of the award-winning, internationally acclaimed children's theatre company Catherine Wheels, the world of White is full of birdsong and birdhouses. Two friends keep the eggs safe and make sure their world remains ordered, and most importantly, always White. Much to the two friends' shock and denial, color starts to appear... The public accompanies the friends in their initial struggle to reject that which is different and unexpected, until the eventual realization that different colors, just like our differences, enrich our lives.







The critics say:
'a palpable hit.' -Tom Dibdin: The Stage
'an utter delight no matter your age.' -The Times
'Gentle, charming and enchanting, White is a must-see.' -David Owens: Wales Online
'as cleverly executed as a conjuring trick.' -Lyn Gardner
'It was so beautifully constructed- the story, the plot (the moments of suspense!), the characters, and the theme. It amazes me how theatre for young children can take an idea and turn it into this terrific sensory experience.' -Picadilly Arts








The public says:
'The BEST play we have been to, for mummy and kids! So so clever and funny. Thank you so much.' (Adelaide 2011) -Jasper and Sophie
""Delight"" is a great word for this show, moving from the ordered and safe world of White to an explosion of color. You've brightened my world today! (Melbourne 2012) -Mary Alice
'To all at WHITE- one of the great experiences of a lifetime. Thank you for the memories and the best 40 minutes of my life. Best of luck and much appreciated. (New York 2011) -Sarah-Jessica Parker
White in Monterrey, Mexico: 
We are looking for funding for two functions in Monterrey, Mexico. For every three tickets purchased, one will be donated to a child from a non profit school called ""La Ciudad de Los Niños."" La Ciudad de Los Niños (The City of the Children) serves children of very low-income families though a rigorous academic and human education, and is on a mission to keep children off the streets. It is extremely rare that these children have access to any cultural or artistic events of any kind. 
In partnership with the non-profit, LA-based Crayon Collection, we invite all attendees to the show to bring their spare art material that they do not use anymore. These will be re-purposed and distributed to the children of La Ciudad de Los Niños.




About me: 
My name is Susana Odriozola, and I am a social-impact driven, freshly-minted theater promoter who believes in the importance of art, the preciousness of childhood, and the innate goodness of people. 
About the team:



Catherine Wheels is an award-winning theater company from Scotland. 


Friday SS is a Monterrey-based production company with experience in producing large concerts and corporate events. 





Our Art Sponsors:

   What We Need We need $12,000 to make this happen. This covers the cost of two functions, one of which YOU will be able to attend! Yes, through the purchase of some of our perks, you can be one of the lucky few to see White in person.

The Impact
 When you contribute towards White in Monterrey, you are giving children from low-income families the gift of travel, color, and imagination, all without leaving their hometown. You are giving them a rare glimpse into a magical world, a glimpse that will remain ingrained in them and can later serve as the catalyst for change. 
More than a single theater show, White would be the seed for positive growth and appreciation of the arts. A single event that can lead to the ripple effect throughout a community deprived of art and theater.
   Risks & Challenges High quality artistic theater from the UK is probably not on people's list of 'Most Needed' in a city in a developing country. There are bigger fish to fry: crime, food availability, illiteracy... People might first feel obliged to contribute to medicine, education, and pressing environmental issues. Please do! Contribute towards these areas!
But art is important too. Although not a necessary tool for survival, for many art is a necessary tool for finding a purpose in life. For self-expression, for finding joy in the everyday mundane, for an escape from our 9 to 5 routines. 
Art may not be essential for survival, but what's the point of survival without art?

<h2>Yesterday, Once More: A Cambodian Musical</h2>
<h3>THE OPPORTUNITY</h3>
<p><br/>This year we have been given a wonderful opportunity - the support of Creative Partnerships Australia to help us raise the seed funds needed to create a new musical in Cambodia. <br/>The Cambodian Space Project is among just a handful of artists chosen to receive Creative Partnerships Australia’s 2017 MATCH Lab grant. This means that if I reach our fundraising goal of $10,000(AUS) it will be matched, dollar for dollar, by CPA. Your donation will be doubled!!</p>
<h3>
<br/>Yesterday, Once More aka Msel Mehn Mdong Tiet - spans the birth, death and resurrection of South East Asian rock’n’roll and explores the life story of one of its most beguiling and mysterious characters – Poev Vannary.</h3>

<h2> </h2>
<h3>AN ESSENTIAL STORY TO TELL</h3>
<p><br/><strong>Yesterday, Once More </strong>(aka Msel Menh Mdong Tiet) tells the story of Cambodia singing sensation <strong>Poev Vannary </strong>- starting out in 1970, a young, ‘liberated’, Khmer woman, Vannary, picks up a folk guitar plus a repertoire of American radio hits and sets her sights on the city. Arriving in Phnom Penh shortly after a coup d’état ousts Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Vannary’s rise to superstardom is as rapid and bewildering as the demise of Marshal Lon Nol’s corrupt and dysfunctional CIA installed regime and the ideological clashes and social shifts of the early 70’s. Cambodia is engulfed in brutal civil war and the nation’s capital soon becomes surrounded by communist forces. In April 1975, Phnom Penh falls to the Khmer Rouge and within days the regime drives the city’s entire population into forced labor camps in the countryside. Musicians and artists become targets of the genocidal regime as it sets about destroying culture in a perverse attempt to erase the past and install “Year Zero” - an agrarian Marxist utopia. From 1975-1979 Cambodia descends into darkness and Poev Vannary disappears along with and estimated 1.7 million people presumed murdered in the killing fields. The next decade proves almost as tough as the 70s; one long struggle to survive but out of the darkness hope returns. Music, art and culture survive and, while her whereabouts remain unknown, Poev Vannary’s hauntingly beautiful songs are rediscovered. It’s this music that returns to the airwaves, helping to heal and reconcile the tortured memories and broken lives of individuals and whole communities rebuilding a violently shattered past. Vannary’s life, loves, hopes and dreams are reimagined in this extraordinary musical that is as much a testimony to the power of the human spirit to overcome as it is a heartbreaking portrayal honoring a young singer’s life, and an entire generation, lost in one of the most devastating chapters in human history.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499060087/mfkptdldyjb5uoeocl0v.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>WITH YOUR SUPPORT WE ACHIEVE SOMETHING INCREDIBLE!</h3>
<p>YOM will be the first musical of it's kind made in Cambodia. The opportunity to create music theatre in Cambodia means that we can make a huge impact on the contemporary arts scene and engage many artists in collaboration as well as reach across to a wide audience within Cambodian and beyond.</p>
<h3>AN OVERWHELMING AND HEARTBREAKING STORY!</h3>
<p><strong>Yesterday, Once More</strong> is an exploration of music by radio stars like Poev Vannary and the little or unknown musicians and entertainers  of the Vietnam War era. In a live show that brings to the stage the “lost sounds” of vintage South East Asian rock’n’roll, it is a vibrant musical extravaganza set against the seismic sociopolitical shifts of the late 60’s through to the dramatic fall of Phnom Penh and Saigon in 1975, and the rediscovery of Cambodian rock - it's reissuing by record labels and filmmakers in the late 80’s and early 90’s and rediscovery by music lovers worldwide.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499060507/ifheisq4i1qfgllrnclf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Okay let's talk about the money! Our aim is to raise 20k to kickstart the production and cover 12 months of development in Cambodia. We don't expect to create YOM on 20k only but will us the money to create the plays script, live and recorded music, set design, dancer and actor auditions and tests, research historical material, create video design for projections, videography for documentary presentation of the project, marketing and communications material to on sell the show to presenter partners internationally. The seed funding we raise for Yesterday, Once More will allow us to undertake all the development and rehearsal work in Cambodia, culminating with a premiere of the show in Phnom Penh.</p>

<h3>
<br/>Staging a professional musical is expensive!</h3>
<p>In Cambodia, where contemporary theatre is virtually non-existent, staging Yesterday, Once More will need all the support we can get but this is a powerful story with fabulous music and a compelling rationale for the creation of such an ambitious work – we believe and will strive to make this incredible independent musical happen it but can only do this with YOUR SUPPORT.</p>
<p>A play requires actors and a director.  A ballet requires dancers and a choreographer.  A concert requires singers and a Musical Director.  A musical requires all 6, plus: assistant directors; repetiteurs; orchestrators; set, costume, lighting and sound designers; costume department; radio mic technicians; scenery builders; follow-spot operators; stage managers; chaperones (if there are children involved); hair and wigs department etc. as well as principal cast, ensemble, swings, orchestra, technical crew, front-of-house team, office staff, company managers and loads more.  All of these need paying, along with the team who wrote the piece in the first place.</p>
<p>Yesterday Once More is our third venture into producing music theatre and will be a work that we will develop entirely in Cambodia.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499057933/njvwnu9erlklncpuxr04.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</div></div>","Yesterday, Once More: A Cambodian Musical
THE OPPORTUNITY
This year we have been given a wonderful opportunity - the support of Creative Partnerships Australia to help us raise the seed funds needed to create a new musical in Cambodia. The Cambodian Space Project is among just a handful of artists chosen to receive Creative Partnerships Australia’s 2017 MATCH Lab grant. This means that if I reach our fundraising goal of $10,000(AUS) it will be matched, dollar for dollar, by CPA. Your donation will be doubled!!

Yesterday, Once More aka Msel Mehn Mdong Tiet - spans the birth, death and resurrection of South East Asian rock’n’roll and explores the life story of one of its most beguiling and mysterious characters – Poev Vannary.

 
 


 
AN ESSENTIAL STORY TO TELL
Yesterday, Once More (aka Msel Menh Mdong Tiet) tells the story of Cambodia singing sensation Poev Vannary - starting out in 1970, a young, ‘liberated’, Khmer woman, Vannary, picks up a folk guitar plus a repertoire of American radio hits and sets her sights on the city. Arriving in Phnom Penh shortly after a coup d’état ousts Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Vannary’s rise to superstardom is as rapid and bewildering as the demise of Marshal Lon Nol’s corrupt and dysfunctional CIA installed regime and the ideological clashes and social shifts of the early 70’s. Cambodia is engulfed in brutal civil war and the nation’s capital soon becomes surrounded by communist forces. In April 1975, Phnom Penh falls to the Khmer Rouge and within days the regime drives the city’s entire population into forced labor camps in the countryside. Musicians and artists become targets of the genocidal regime as it sets about destroying culture in a perverse attempt to erase the past and install “Year Zero” - an agrarian Marxist utopia. From 1975-1979 Cambodia descends into darkness and Poev Vannary disappears along with and estimated 1.7 million people presumed murdered in the killing fields. The next decade proves almost as tough as the 70s; one long struggle to survive but out of the darkness hope returns. Music, art and culture survive and, while her whereabouts remain unknown, Poev Vannary’s hauntingly beautiful songs are rediscovered. It’s this music that returns to the airwaves, helping to heal and reconcile the tortured memories and broken lives of individuals and whole communities rebuilding a violently shattered past. Vannary’s life, loves, hopes and dreams are reimagined in this extraordinary musical that is as much a testimony to the power of the human spirit to overcome as it is a heartbreaking portrayal honoring a young singer’s life, and an entire generation, lost in one of the most devastating chapters in human history.

WITH YOUR SUPPORT WE ACHIEVE SOMETHING INCREDIBLE!
YOM will be the first musical of it's kind made in Cambodia. The opportunity to create music theatre in Cambodia means that we can make a huge impact on the contemporary arts scene and engage many artists in collaboration as well as reach across to a wide audience within Cambodian and beyond.
AN OVERWHELMING AND HEARTBREAKING STORY!
Yesterday, Once More is an exploration of music by radio stars like Poev Vannary and the little or unknown musicians and entertainers  of the Vietnam War era. In a live show that brings to the stage the “lost sounds” of vintage South East Asian rock’n’roll, it is a vibrant musical extravaganza set against the seismic sociopolitical shifts of the late 60’s through to the dramatic fall of Phnom Penh and Saigon in 1975, and the rediscovery of Cambodian rock - it's reissuing by record labels and filmmakers in the late 80’s and early 90’s and rediscovery by music lovers worldwide.


What We Need & What You Get

Okay let's talk about the money! Our aim is to raise 20k to kickstart the production and cover 12 months of development in Cambodia. We don't expect to create YOM on 20k only but will us the money to create the plays script, live and recorded music, set design, dancer and actor auditions and tests, research historical material, create video design for projections, videography for documentary presentation of the project, marketing and communications material to on sell the show to presenter partners internationally. The seed funding we raise for Yesterday, Once More will allow us to undertake all the development and rehearsal work in Cambodia, culminating with a premiere of the show in Phnom Penh.


Staging a professional musical is expensive!
In Cambodia, where contemporary theatre is virtually non-existent, staging Yesterday, Once More will need all the support we can get but this is a powerful story with fabulous music and a compelling rationale for the creation of such an ambitious work – we believe and will strive to make this incredible independent musical happen it but can only do this with YOUR SUPPORT.
A play requires actors and a director.  A ballet requires dancers and a choreographer.  A concert requires singers and a Musical Director.  A musical requires all 6, plus: assistant directors; repetiteurs; orchestrators; set, costume, lighting and sound designers; costume department; radio mic technicians; scenery builders; follow-spot operators; stage managers; chaperones (if there are children involved); hair and wigs department etc. as well as principal cast, ensemble, swings, orchestra, technical crew, front-of-house team, office staff, company managers and loads more.  All of these need paying, along with the team who wrote the piece in the first place.
Yesterday Once More is our third venture into producing music theatre and will be a work that we will develop entirely in Cambodia.

What happens if we don't reach our funding goal?
Should we fall short of our target (let's hope not) we will still use the funds to work on Yesterday Once More but will re-prioritize aspects of the production - e.g. we can do a lot to progress this work by using smaller amounts for producing video documentary and audition and rehearsal sessions and/or writing and recording sessions to create a 'soundtrack' as a stand alone release. The production will continue to raise funds via grants and commissions and we have a proven track record  in self-producing - concept to stage - and achieving our production targets.
Why it's so important to make this a success

Yesterday, Once More is such an important historical story and is a ready made musical considering the incredible era of music the narrative covers. This gives us the chance to create meaningful and compelling storytelling that is as haunting and confronting as it is uplifting and inspiring. We believe the process of making YOM will be a success in itself - pioneering contemporary theatre in Cambodia and bringing international opportunities for all the artists involved as well as inspiring others to create new works that will add quality and sustainability to the creative community in Cambodia.

Now in it's 7th year, we are able to consider works like Yesterday, Once More: A Cambodian Musical simply because of all the support and encouragement our wonderful friends, families, fans and supporters have given the project. It's this generosity of spirit that keeps us flying! and allows us the inspiration as well as the resources to create music and art that is so important in showing strength, fortitude and the incredible natural talents of Srey Channthy and chart the incredible distance we've all come. Most of all it's all about bringing communities together and celebrating in a totally cosmic way - vive! Cambodian Rock'n'Roll!

<p>     PulsePDX began in May of 2011 with the goal of creating a unique dance fitness experience that would combine the fun of a nightclub with the health benefits of a fitness center. Along the way, though, we realized that PulsePDX is so much more than just a place to work out. It is a place where people rediscover the joy of dance and movement, where people reach health goals they didn’t think possible, where new friendships and connections are created daily, where people deal with the stress of their everyday life, and where they celebrate life’s special occasions. It is both nightclub-style fitness and a very special community.</p>
<p>     After renting venues by the hour to hold our nightclub-style fitness classes, we have decided to make the leap and move into our very own building. Taking on this new opportunity will allow us to continue to improve our customer experience, add new and exciting classes, and increase our charitable activities. Luckily, the perfect building was located, but it needs some work! Most notably, it needs a good dance floor that will provide the right amount of spring in order to be easy on people’s joints, and it needs to be impervious to changes in temperature and humidity so students always have just the right amount of traction for the best class experience.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What We Are Doing &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>     Moving into a new space and designing it from the ground up to best meet our community's needs and desires is a tremendous undertaking. There are many important elements that we are incorporating to make each PulsePDX class experience the best possible: high-tech lights, an amazing sound system, a stage for easy viewing, a comfortable waiting room, a water fountain for easy sport bottle refills, a fast check-in area, good climate control, and beautiful new bathrooms. While all of these elements are important, none are as important to the quality of our classes as the dance floor! Whether we are dancing around in Zumba®, barefoot in willPower&amp;grace®, or on our mats in Melt® or Burn, a good floor makes all the difference in both the safety and appeal of the class.</p>
<p>     Many of you have asked how you can get involved.  As we complete the build out of the PulsePDX building and further foster the PulsePDX community, we are excited to offer you the chance to be a part of it!  We are not just asking for help in creating the perfect PulsePDX dance floor experience, we have some very unique gifts and perks to offer in exchange for your support that will only be available through this campaign.  From a specially designed t-shirt by Julio Aleman, to an exclusive launch event for contributors only, to an action photo shoot by Megan Henson Photography under the Pulse lights, these are items on which you won’t want to miss out! If you want to join the Pulse team in choosing and creating a class, or always be guaranteed the best cubby or parking spot available, we have something for you, too!</p>
<p>     <span>Any funds raised during this campaign will be applied to the approximate cost to install the new dance floor.  Join us in this campaign with the satisfaction of knowing you helped make it possible for everyone to enjoy the amazing classes and PulsePDX community for many years to come.</span></p>

<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>     Since our inception, giving back to our community has been one of our company goals. In our first year of business we helped to raise close to $12,000 for charities such as Passionately Pink for the Cure, the Special Olympics of Oregon, The Autism Society, and the Jefferson Dancers. It is our hope that our new space will give us many more ways we can play an active role in supporting charities and local non-profits. Having a nicely sprung, durable floor will allow us to hold a range of events from Zumbathons to auctions, dinners, fashion shows, and live performances.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><strong>A Word on the <em>Let's Go There Collective</em></strong></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><em>""Don't even go there.""</em></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Originating in 2009 as a writers/artists group of women of color and their allies, the <em>Let's Go There Collective</em> expanded into the area of theater in 2012. We are women from Palestine, the African Diaspora, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Haiti, Sicily, and Iraq who have decided that telling the stories of our people, of our struggle for liberation and our resistance, is central to our humanity and consequently our art.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">We believe that art (in this case theater) belongs to all of us and exists as a means of communicating the beauty and pain of our lives, and at the same time what we need to know and do collectively as we engage in struggle day to day.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">We believe that artistic exploration, in the theater, on the written page, in music, or on the canvas, should be accessible to everyone including folks working tough schedules, organizers, moms, teachers, youth, our elders--  folks with big life commitments.</p>

</div></div>","A Word on the Let's Go There Collective
""Don't even go there.""
Originating in 2009 as a writers/artists group of women of color and their allies, the Let's Go There Collective expanded into the area of theater in 2012. We are women from Palestine, the African Diaspora, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Haiti, Sicily, and Iraq who have decided that telling the stories of our people, of our struggle for liberation and our resistance, is central to our humanity and consequently our art.
We believe that art (in this case theater) belongs to all of us and exists as a means of communicating the beauty and pain of our lives, and at the same time what we need to know and do collectively as we engage in struggle day to day.
We believe that artistic exploration, in the theater, on the written page, in music, or on the canvas, should be accessible to everyone including folks working tough schedules, organizers, moms, teachers, youth, our elders--  folks with big life commitments.
We believe that art, in and of itself, is not an end, but part of the journey of struggle. It is and should be part of our daily lives. It should educate and inspire. Perhaps most importantly, it should be a leaping off point for collective exploration, discussion, and ultimately action.
Our first theatrical production will be the premiere performance of an original play on Palestinian political prisoners written, directed, and acted by members of our collective.
We are fundraising for this production as well as for future theatrical projects this summer.
We are trying to raise $2000 by May 1st. Your contribution will go toward production costs including venue, lighting design, costumes, set, programs, and flyers.
With this in mind, we invite you to join us not only for a ""theatrical experience"", but to engage/question/discuss/organize(!) after each of our shows.
Let's go there!

<p>SO....</p>
<p>Can you make a contribution to our crowdfunder?</p>
<p>If the answer is <u><strong>YES</strong></u> you will be helping to raise awareness for those who have suffered abuse, those who are still suffering and those who have been effected by infertility - you <u><strong>WILL</strong></u> be encouraging those who come to see the play, and who have been affected, to seek help with organisations we will be working with.</p>
<p>If you can, please donate any amount, or buy a perk!</p>

<h2><u><strong>What We Need &amp; What You will Get!</strong></u></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>We need to raise £5000 by December.</strong></p>
<p>We need to raise £8,000 overall - the second stage of raising money will be at a <strong>charity event on December 17th</strong> at the o2 Academy in Islington, London - it is set to be a great event so get involved people! Look out for the launch of the event mid November!</p>
<p>All money will be used for the following:  cover marketing coats, stage craft, creatives payment, hires costs, rehearsal/performance costs, and of course to connect to those who have been effected by the play, to the charities and support groups we will be working with.</p>
<h2><u><strong>PERKS &amp; DONATIONS:</strong></u></h2>
<p>We have some wonderful perks!</p>
<p>We are working very closely with the internationally acclaimed artist Louis Masai; he is a environmental artist known for raising awareness against the extinction of nature and endangered animals - a great link to our show! To all of us on the team, nature is an important part of healing, and so we wanted to work withs someone who was as passionate about connections to nature as we are.</p>
<p> We are VERY lucky to have some of his art as rewards!</p>
<p>We also have badges, rehearsal experiences and much more! Have a look to the right of the page for full list of perks.</p>
<p>Feel free to buy a perk, or you can make a donation. All that is received is helpful and goes towards making this show happen. <u>YOUR CONTRIBUTION WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE!</u></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2><u>The Impact...</u></h2>
<p>Every member of our team is extremely passionate and active in using theatre to try and make the world a better place - sounds cheesy, but it is true! Through our work we all will be raising awareness for sexual abuse, fertility and the positive benefits of nature.</p>
<p> We believe that theatre has the power to make a difference, to encourage, to empower, to influence and to create change. Wouldn't it be phenomenal if people who came to see this play were able to be inspired, seek help and support? We are want the audience to <u>respond.</u></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><u><strong style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Risks &amp; Challenges...</strong></u></h2>
<p>Putting on a play with trigger themes is a risk, it carries some responsibility. We hope to raise awareness only, and to share our own stories - a risk in itself! We hope people will come to all our shows in March; we are at a wonderful venue that has faith on our work, our story and our truths - we hope you will have faith in us too! </p>
<p>Our main challenge is to get this funding - any logistical problems can be easily rectified as we are a well connected team with links to rehearsal spaces and venues etc.</p>

inspiration: the DMV (Department of Motor Vehicles), anywhere USA. At the DMV,
we encounter three women, complete strangers who’ve been patiently standing in
the same line for an hour. Thanks to one simple yet unexpected act of kindness,
they start to speak candidly with one another and share details of their lives.
As fate would have it, all three women have heard of the profound <i>L’il
Black Taoist</i>, and their serendipitous meeting at the DMV no longer seems
like a simple chance encounter. For these three women, heartfelt conversation
with strangers in an ordinary setting becomes a life changing event.</span></p><p></p><p></p>

ABOUT THE PROJECT: 
“Talking to DeVon” is a multi-layered, funny,
complex yet light-hearted musical that explores the possibilities of trust,
openness, respect and generosity between strangers. It is a Multi-Media Musical
that features spoken word, song, sound and video installations, dance, fine
art, and live percussion all set to an original digital trance-house music
soundtrack.
 
“Talking to DeVon” takes you on a journey to
explore human connectedness in a place that doesn’t usually promise
inspiration: the DMV (Department of Motor Vehicles), anywhere USA. At the DMV,
we encounter three women, complete strangers who’ve been patiently standing in
the same line for an hour. Thanks to one simple yet unexpected act of kindness,
they start to speak candidly with one another and share details of their lives.
As fate would have it, all three women have heard of the profound L’il
Black Taoist, and their serendipitous meeting at the DMV no longer seems
like a simple chance encounter. For these three women, heartfelt conversation
with strangers in an ordinary setting becomes a life changing event.

WHO IS DEVON?
Devon was Leisha Lashawn’s younger
brother. At the end of 2008, Leisha lost Devon in a devastating car crash. She
says that:  ""Devon's death, has forever changed me and everyone who
knew him. In 2007, I began to experiment with digital music by making loops
that I could play alongside my drums. I played those early loops DeVon, He
loved the sound and he encouraged me to continue.""
 
""In life,
DeVon inspired me,  and now even though
he has moved on, he continues to do so. This play is more than a simple musical,
it is my grieving process made manifest and it is a celebration of Devon’s life.
For Devon, there were no strangers, just friends he hadn’t met yet.”

BooTown is an independent theatre group in Houston, Texas.
We focus on homegrown storytelling based pieces that audiences have never seen
before and this Spring we are bringing back the popular Benshi Show from last season. This time around we are interpreting Roadhouse, the cult American Classic starring Patrick Swayze and Sam Elliot.



In a traditional Japanese Benshi show, Benshi performers memorized western movies and then
reinterpreted the story for an eastern audience. BooTownâ€™s crew (BooTown founder
Emily Hynds, Blake Whitaker and Joe Wozny) will retell the story of two
battling bar bouncers through their own satirical commentary backed by the
musical stylings of local blues hound Lucas Gorham (Grandfather Child).

â€œHopefully, the audience will go away with a ton of laughs,
and the overwhelming urge to high-five their best friend. Or just roundhouse
kick someone,â€ the show's director and BooTown Associate Artistic Director Lindsay Burleson says.

In keeping with our mission of producing in
non-traditional settings in order to cultivate new audiences, the play will be
performed at Rudyardâ€™s British Pub, home of the Grown-up Storytime series. 

The production runs March 9-10 at 8p.m. and March 16 at
10:30 p.m. and midnight at Rudyardâ€™s, 2010 Waugh, Houston TX 77006. Tickets are
pay-what-you-can and can be purchased at the door.

you on our fancy-pants website.

«  Les
membres de Belzébrute (...) ont choisi l'indépendance. Ils se débrouillent avec
peu, en dehors des théâtres établis. S'ils travaillent dans un esprit festif et
décontracté, ils sont pourtant très sérieux quand vient le temps de polir
l'esthétique. » 
Philippe Couture le DEVOIR
BELZÉBRUTE :
Belzébrute se définit comme un band de théâtre --
auteurs-concepteurs-interprètes -- qui se plaît à créer des spectacles à GRAND
déploiement et petit budget.  À travers ses créations, le band explore
avec une énergie lumineuse et une désinvolture contagieuse le théâtre d’objets,
la marionnette, le jeu masqué, la poésie de l’image et le théâtre d’ombres.
 
who are we ?
 
“The members of Belzébrute chose
independence. They manage with very little money.  They work in a very
festive spirit but they are, nevertheless, very serious when comes the time to
refining   their work”.
 
Philippe Couture Le DEVOIR 
 Belzébrute
:
 
Belzébrute defines itself as a Theater Band which
likes to create Tiny budget-mega productions… Through its creations Belzébrute
explore Object Theater, Puppetry, Shadow Theater, Mask Play and the poetry
images with a contagious energy. 
 
 
LE PROJET :
 
Notre nouvelle création Manga ! sera jouée au Festival Fringe de Montréal
et de Windsor en juin et juillet 2011. 
Nous avons besoin d'un gros coup de
main pour transporter Manga à Windsor en Ontario. Le spectacle ayant connu un
immense succès à Montréal en janvier dernier, nous voulons le faire connaître à
un plus grand nombre de spectateurs et le Fringe nous apparaît être la meilleure
vitrine !!
 
 
THE PROJECT :
 
Manga! Our latest
creation will be performed at the Fringe Festival of Montreal and Windsor
(Ontario) in June and July 2011 
This is why we need your help ! It is very costly to
carry the show to Windsor. Since the show was a great success in Montreal last
January we want a largest number of spectators to see it. The Windsor Fringe
Festival is the best place to start our quest. 
 
 
LE SHOW : 
Depuis sept ans, Ritsuko prépare soigneusement sa
vengeance et la voici enfin aux portes de sa libération… Voilà une audacieuse
histoire épique délicieusement ingénieuse. Un délirant voyage au cœur d'un Japon médiéval déjanté. Vous en perdrez votre japonais!
 
Avec Manga, Belzébrute propose un univers peuplé de
samouraïs, de vieux sages et de Shogun. Dans un langage pseudo-japonais, la
pièce nous entraîne sur les traces de Ritsuko qui concocte sa propre vendetta.
 
Manga constitue le second volet de la trilogie de la
vengeance, amorcée avec « Shavirez le Tsigane des mers».
À mi-chemin entre la bande dessinée et le cinéma d’animation japonais,
Manga est une succession ininterrompue de tableaux qui compose une trame
narrative mystérieuse, poétique et où l’image prime sur la parole. http://www.belzebrute.com/Revue_de_Presse.html

 
THE SHOW :
For the past seven
years, Ritsuko has been concocting her vengeance.  And now here she is, at
last, ready to get her revenge against the Shogun.   Belzébrute
presents Manga an epic and deliciously clever adventure into an off-the-wall
medieval Japan.  You will lose your Japanese!!!
 
Manga
is the second part of Belzébrute’s trilogy of vengeance, begun with
""Shavirez the Gypsy of the Seas"".
Halfway
between the comic and Japanese animation film, Manga is an uninterrupted
succession of scenes that compose a mysterious and poetic narrative in witch
the image prevails on the speech. Once again Belzébrute plunges in a contagious
energy that will keep you on the edge of your seat.

OBJECTIF 2000$ :

-       
ATTEINT : On est heureux
-       
SURPASSÉ : En plus d’être heureux on va pouvoir se payer de la bouffe !
-        PAS
ATTEINT : Nous sommes dans le rouge, mais rien ne nous arrête, alors nous irons quand même... Au risque d'avoir à tirer le camion par les dents en se relayant à tour de rôle ou encore se mettre à genoux devant notre banquier pour qu'il nous accorde ""encore"" une marge de crédit, car qui sait nous sommes peut-être les futurs Guy Laliberté de ce monde !!
 
Our Goal 2000$ :
-       
If we achieve our goal : We
are so happy !!!
-       
If we exceed our goal: We will be
able to eat !
-       
If  not reached: Well… that
means we will probably have to tow the mini van by hand between Belleville and
Windsor (approximately 500 km)… but I guess that, since nothing can stop
Belzébrute, we will still go on… Go Belzébrute, go!!!
 
Nous avons besoin de :
-2000$ : location
d’une mini van + coût du gaz continuellement à la hausse… (au dessus de 1800km
allez-retour)
-200$ : pour la
promotion flyers, affiches, communiqués couleurs
-150$ : hôtel sur
la route, c’est long 10h de route…
Là bas nous serons logés, mais pas nourrit, si
nous arrivons à dépasser notre objectif, et nos besoins, nous pourrons allouer
un budget pour se faire des épiceries. 
 
Votre participation nous permet non seulement de
nous déplacer mais aussi à faire grandir une compagnie qui est en pleine
expansion. 
 
our needs :
-
$2000 : mini van rental and gas (over 1800km)
-
$200: For promotion material (Posters, flyers, color press release…)
-
$150: For accommodations (Montreal-Windsor is a long trip…)
 
Your donation also  helps a growing company
in its expansion.

<p>Hi! I'm Bobby Holder, artistic director of The Actor's Project NYC, a unique theatre company that assists it's actors land representation and get work through industry showcases and plays.  I'm also a writer and playwright.   I wrote a play inspired by a scene called MOTHER from my book OUT OF THE BLUE.  The play is called:            <br/></p>
<p>                         <b>Manhattan Fable-The Actress Who Cried Wolf!  </b></p>
<p><strong>Manhattan Fable-The Actress Who Cried Wolf! is not only the twisted dark comedy of an actress who is haunted and begins to believe her own lies, but is also a heartbreaking tale of a young couple, Andrew and Carla, who are passionately fighting and loving while living in a cluttered, small apartment in midtown Manhattan. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The play begins with four characters addressing the audience, preparing them for the frantic story that is about to unfold.  There is conflict, arguments, and dry wit, as each character tries to explain when all the madness began:</strong></p>
<p><i>         ""I'm Andrew, and this all began the day Carla thought she was pregnant."" <br/></i></p>
<p><i>          ""I'm Acantha, and I am part of this story."" <br/></i></p>
<p><i>         ""I'm Carla, and this all happened the day I read Andrew's journal."" <br/></i></p>
<p><i>         ""And I'm Anna.  This all began the day I died.""</i><strong><i><br/></i></strong></p></span></span><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p>The Actor's Project NYC first produced Manhattan Fable in 2009 to wonderful feedback from audiences, talent agents and managers.  However funding did not allow us to extend the play to be viewed by a larger audience.  Increasing costs in producing a play have made it difficult for us to keep the original play division alive in our company. <br/></p>

<h3>The Show</h3>
<p>Nicholas Sparks, whose novel ""The Notebook"" and subsequent film reduced even the most sturdy of men to blubbering tears, is an international sensation. He has written over a dozen novels, several of which have become blockbuster tearjerkers on the big screen. In this (obviously) completely fabricated satirical comedy, we investigate how and why Sparks became the unparalleled master of the ""Crymance"" genre.</p>
<p>In the play, Nicholas Sparks is visited by the ghost of his ancestor, Reginald Sparks, who tells him he must save the world from a bloodthirsty demon named Rodanthe. The only defense against this demon is the tears of humanity. Nick vows to write ""The saddest damn book in the damn world!"" to keep the mankind crying and therefore safe from the apocalypse. But Nick soon crumbles beneath the weight of his newfound fame. He must learn to keep the secret of his destiny close to his heart or risk being locked in a mental institution and kept from the woman he loves forever.</p>
<div>The play will premiere at the 2012 New York International Fringe Festival. According to Mayor Bloomberg, FringeNYC has ""...been a big part of downtown Manhattan's  burgeoning cultural scene, and it has launched the careers of many a director, designer, and actor - all the while  maintaining a top ticket price of $15. Despite its name, ""The Fringe"" is at the very center of this city's unrivaled creativity.""</div>
<div><strong><span class=""open""><br/></span></strong></div>
<div>
<strong class=""open""> </strong>Needless to say, we're pretty honored and pumped! However, we're going to need a little help to give this show the production it deserves for its maiden voyage.</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Help Nicholas Sparks Save the World! (Or help us help him).</h3>
<p>FringeNYC is an incredible organization and it provides each of its productions with a historic downtown theater space, lighting and sound equipment, wonderful volunteer PAs, and personalized publicity. However, there are a few things that FringeNYC does <strong>not</strong> typically pick up the tab for...</p>
<ul>
<li>Rehearsal Studio Fees</li>
<li>Props and Costumes</li>
<li>Actors' Equity Stipends</li>
<li>Designer Fees</li>
<li>Transportation Expenses</li>
</ul>
We need a little extra help covering these costs to make our show as big and beautiful and crazy as it can be! Every little bit will help put a wig on an actor or a designer on a train. Or a fearsome demon back into Hell where it belongs.</div>
<h3><strong>Who We Are</strong></h3>
<p>We are Christina Brosman and Elizabeth Kerin. We wrote ""And Then She DIES at the End!"" and will be directing it as a team for Fringe. We're graduates of the Goldberg Department of Dramatic Writing at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, former roommates, and have collectively read a total of one page of a Nicholas Sparks book as research for this project. Christina read it and then sent it to Liz, if we're splitting hairs. Liz divides her time between New York and LA and Christina is settled in New York. We've been working virtually a lot lately, cultivating a successful long distance relationship of sorts. We're very excited to embark on our first theatre piece together after years of collaborating in other mediums!</p>
<p>Audra Arnaudon is our formidable producer/ACR (Authorized Company Representative for FringeNYC). She majored in Film and Television and minored in Producing at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts. She met Christina while in line for a movie at the Cannes International Film Festival in 2008, and was introduced to Liz later that summer. When not finding ways to support our collective artistic endeavors, she works in Production Management for National Geographic Television, and lives happily in Brooklyn. We couldn't do this without her!</p>
<p>Jill Sapenoff, our stage manager, h<span>as worked on a wide range of entertainment productions including projects in video, stage, television, and film. Stage credits include </span><em>Rebecca the Musical </em><span>(Broadway, Fall 2012), </span><em>Voices in Conflict </em><span>(Public Theatre, Vineyard Theatre), </span><em>Swimming in the Shallows </em><span>(Theatre for the New City). TV/Film credits include </span><em>Putzel </em><span>(Stouthearted Films)</span><em>, Bert and Arnie's Guide to Friendship </em><span>(Justified Ends Entertainment)</span><em>, The Newlywed Game </em><span>(Game Show Network)</span><em>.</em></p>

<h3>Fringe &amp; The Future (Of humanity?)</h3>
<p>FringeNYC has served as a springboard to Broadway and Off-Broadway for many years, introducing the world to shows like ""Urinetown"" and ""Dog Sees God"". The festival has also launched the careers of many a well-known writer, such as one of our favorites, The Office's Mindy Kaling. Basically: Kill it at Fringe and it can open doors. Doors you will have helped us walk through!</p>
<p>We would love to take you on the adventure that is building a theatre piece from the ground up. We hope you'll support our show and the tradition of FringeNYC!</p>

</div></div>","The Show
Nicholas Sparks, whose novel ""The Notebook"" and subsequent film reduced even the most sturdy of men to blubbering tears, is an international sensation. He has written over a dozen novels, several of which have become blockbuster tearjerkers on the big screen. In this (obviously) completely fabricated satirical comedy, we investigate how and why Sparks became the unparalleled master of the ""Crymance"" genre.
In the play, Nicholas Sparks is visited by the ghost of his ancestor, Reginald Sparks, who tells him he must save the world from a bloodthirsty demon named Rodanthe. The only defense against this demon is the tears of humanity. Nick vows to write ""The saddest damn book in the damn world!"" to keep the mankind crying and therefore safe from the apocalypse. But Nick soon crumbles beneath the weight of his newfound fame. He must learn to keep the secret of his destiny close to his heart or risk being locked in a mental institution and kept from the woman he loves forever.
The play will premiere at the 2012 New York International Fringe Festival. According to Mayor Bloomberg, FringeNYC has ""...been a big part of downtown Manhattan's  burgeoning cultural scene, and it has launched the careers of many a director, designer, and actor - all the while  maintaining a top ticket price of $15. Despite its name, ""The Fringe"" is at the very center of this city's unrivaled creativity.""


 Needless to say, we're pretty honored and pumped! However, we're going to need a little help to give this show the production it deserves for its maiden voyage.


Help Nicholas Sparks Save the World! (Or help us help him).
FringeNYC is an incredible organization and it provides each of its productions with a historic downtown theater space, lighting and sound equipment, wonderful volunteer PAs, and personalized publicity. However, there are a few things that FringeNYC does not typically pick up the tab for...

Rehearsal Studio Fees
Props and Costumes
Actors' Equity Stipends
Designer Fees
Transportation Expenses

We need a little extra help covering these costs to make our show as big and beautiful and crazy as it can be! Every little bit will help put a wig on an actor or a designer on a train. Or a fearsome demon back into Hell where it belongs.
Who We Are
We are Christina Brosman and Elizabeth Kerin. We wrote ""And Then She DIES at the End!"" and will be directing it as a team for Fringe. We're graduates of the Goldberg Department of Dramatic Writing at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, former roommates, and have collectively read a total of one page of a Nicholas Sparks book as research for this project. Christina read it and then sent it to Liz, if we're splitting hairs. Liz divides her time between New York and LA and Christina is settled in New York. We've been working virtually a lot lately, cultivating a successful long distance relationship of sorts. We're very excited to embark on our first theatre piece together after years of collaborating in other mediums!
Audra Arnaudon is our formidable producer/ACR (Authorized Company Representative for FringeNYC). She majored in Film and Television and minored in Producing at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts. She met Christina while in line for a movie at the Cannes International Film Festival in 2008, and was introduced to Liz later that summer. When not finding ways to support our collective artistic endeavors, she works in Production Management for National Geographic Television, and lives happily in Brooklyn. We couldn't do this without her!
Jill Sapenoff, our stage manager, has worked on a wide range of entertainment productions including projects in video, stage, television, and film. Stage credits include Rebecca the Musical (Broadway, Fall 2012), Voices in Conflict (Public Theatre, Vineyard Theatre), Swimming in the Shallows (Theatre for the New City). TV/Film credits include Putzel (Stouthearted Films), Bert and Arnie's Guide to Friendship (Justified Ends Entertainment), The Newlywed Game (Game Show Network).

<p>Hello! My name is Roy Harrington Tracy. I am currently a Masters of Fine Arts (MFA) Candidate in Dance at the College at Brockport. I am heading a funding initiative and represent a group of six dancers who have been invited to premiere a new dance by James Hansen in the Pasadena Dance Festival in California! This festival would be a powerful networking tool for each of us and could lay the groundwork for many more performance opportunities in the future. This opportunity is unbelievably exciting for us and we are committed to representing western NY dance in a positive way!</p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>When we found out we were accepted to perform, we all released hesitant cheers of excitement not being sure we could fund the trip. Then, I had a thought. There are seven of us involved in the project. If each one of our friends on Facebook donated just 1 dollar, we would cover travel expenses and food for everyone. I am using this media to reach out to family and friends that are connected to the 7 of us and asking you to help raise the money needed! Again, just $1 would make this trip possible. (but feel free to donate more.  In fact…feel free to donate as much as you can!!!!!!!)</p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $3,000 which, when added to several small grants we are applying for, will completely cover our travel expenses for this exciting adventure as artists.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>For each of us the professional opportunities we will encounter by participating in this festival can and likely will shape our future careers.</p>
<p>Professionally, it will provide a HUGE networking opportunity which in Dance is essential.  Meeting other choreographers, performers, producers, and dance professionals will enhance our resources to create and produce our own choreography in the future and can also lay the groundwork for future teaching and performing jobs.  Working with dance artists from a different region of the country will strengthen the quality of our own artistic voices by exposing us to new aesthetics and creative forces. In the professional arena of dance performance, these kinds of experiences are crucial to success.</p>
<p>Personally, for most of us, this will be our first professional performance on the west coast which makes it even more exciting.</p>
<p>Our company includes myself and Mathew Frazier Smith, Vaness VanWormer, Devon Monin, Zachary Frazee, and Brett Cox.  Each of us are at different paths of our careers but we are all passionate about our art and eager to share it with a west coast audience in the Pasadena Dance Festival.  The choreographer, James Hansen, has had his work produced in amazing theaters like the Kennedy Center and Jacob’s Pillow. </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Even if you can't contribute financially to this campaign, please help by sharing through various forms of social media and spreading the word to anyone who might have an interest in supporting the arts and one of the most enjoyable groups I have had the privilege of working with!</p></div>","Short Summary

Cinderella: The Tragedy of Mónica Lafemme, slightly cradled in the folkloric tale told by the Brothers Grimm in which a detective investigates the murder of a young prostitute shot at midnight. As a former client of the departed, the detective must tread lightly in order to avoid bringing suspicion upon himself. Together with friends and partners I created an independent theatrical group named ""Irkelú"" whose first production will be the aforementioned Cinderella.What We Need & What You GetAs an independent group, we have to raise the amount necessary in order to comply with the calculated budget for the production.The final budget rounded $1,000 of which we have raised $400 with local sponsors and fundraising initiatives. The gross of the money would be allocated to the construction of the sets and publicity. If we're not able to reach the goal, any money donated will be used in the aforementioned categories in the best way possible. Your help will greatly help foster the emerging theatrical groups and artists back here in Puerto Rico that with much talent, and scarce resources, strive to do what they love most and develop a healthy industry.   The ImpactAs a first formal experience carried out with fellow students and future professionals, in which we're able to apply our newly and everyday growing set of skills and knowledge, the success of this project would prove that there is a career and a life to be made out of theater. We would see the results of our hard work and dedication for this project has been in the works for over more than six months. And, maybe not the world, but those who contribute and learn of the play will experience hands-on the importance of theater, how it is merely a mean to understanding ourselves in search for a better life.Other Ways You Can HelpEvery and any help on the matter will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Les
Lutins et le Farfama, qu’est ce donc ? C’est un conte musical pour enfants
débordant d'énergie, de poésie et de féerie. </p>
<p>Ecoutez plutôt :</p>
<p><i>«Savez-vous ce qui se passe près de
chez vous ? Dans un monde magiquement coloré de musique, que certains ne
soupçonnent même pas !? Prenez deux lutins, fous d’amour l’un pour
l’autre : Luzel et Libélia, et  un
écureuil malicieux nommé Timus. Ajoutez un énorme danger dissimulé dans une
toute petite boîte, trouvée devant leur toute petite porte ! Vous voilà
parti pour une aventure inoubliable !! </i></p>
<p><i>C’est le voyage de Luzel
et Libélia, à la recherche d’ingrédients, peu ordinaires, pour combattre ce
mal, l’horrible Farfama ! Laissez vous emporter, ce monde vous enchantera !!
Entrez dans la Forêt Chanteuse, l’ancêtre de tous les arbres y abrite le Vieux
Papi, roi des claquettes, aux multiples secrets !! Osez vous approchez du
lac bouillonnant. Saperlipopette ! Vous ne rêvez pas : voici bien un
champignon qui sort d’un lac et, qui en dit long dans son fond ! Et
Florisse, un drôle de petit lutin farfelu, qui décidément se passionne pour les
fleurs et les « SACS à PAPIER » ! Puis vient le moment
d’affronter l’horreur, la pire chose, et cette odeur répugnante qui envahit
l’espace, le manque d’air, les hurlements des profondeurs torturées….</i></p>
<p><i>Heureusement il y a
encore la musique !</i><i> Mais que se passe-t-il vraiment ? Quel
est le contenu de cette  étrange petite
boîte ?</i><i> Vous ne le savez toujours pas ?</i></p>
<p><i>Entrez, tendez l’oreille,
et regardez… »</i></p>
<p>Ce conte
musical, les enfants l’adorent. Les parents y sont sensibles aussi. Les
personnages sont haut en couleur, la musique de qualité, variée tantôt douce et
harmonieuse, tantôt jazzy et colorée. Enjoué,  émouvant, drôle, effrayant, il s’est invité
dans les familles, les écoles, et même en 
cours de chant ! En quelques années <i>Les Lutins et le Farfama</i> a trouvé son public et a rencontré un
succès formidable en région toulousaine.</p></span><b>L'origine des Lutins et le Farfama.</b><br/><p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Je
m’appelle Nadia NELL, et je suis <b>passionnée de musique </b>et des arts en
général  depuis ma plus tendre enfance. A
la suite de mes études (Premier Prix de piano, classes d’écriture, chant…), ma
passion fut entretenue grâce aux rencontres et aux partages avec toute sorte de
musiciens, amateurs ou professionnels, et grâce à la rencontre il y a quelques
années, d’une histoire pour enfant, écrite par une collègue clarinettiste, l’histoire
des <i>Lutins et du Farfama.</i></p>
<p><b>L’envie d’écrire des chansons </b>et les idées musicales se sont imposées à moi dès la première lecture. Il
fallait que cette musique jaillisse sur le papier;  l’écriture me rapprochait de mon enfance,
d’un état que j’exprime comme cela :</p>
<p> <i>Il me reste quelque chose de l’enfance si loin, si proche. Quelque
chose d’évanescent et cependant si présent, à chaque battement de cœur, à toute
respiration nouvelle. Un imaginaire qui vacille entre des mondes malfaisants et
des mondes héroïques, fait de jeux et de peurs, de danses et de combats. De
nombreuses fois, je m’y suis égarée avec délectation. Juste quelques minutes,
parfois des heures entières. </i></p>
<p><i>J’y ai bougé et sculpté des images ; j’ai coloré cet espace
impalpable de mots, de gestes, de sons, de bruits, de musique. Quelque part…
Là, dans cet ailleurs, où tout prend vie : de nos espoirs les plus fous à
nos peurs les plus terrifiantes, où l’impossible n’existe pas… </i></p>
<p>Alors cet imaginaire si présent ne
m’a plus laissé le choix. Il me fut dès lors impossible de laisser reposer ce

Lutins et le Farfama, qu’est ce donc ? C’est un conte musical pour enfants
débordant d'énergie, de poésie et de féerie. 
Ecoutez plutôt :
«Savez-vous ce qui se passe près de
chez vous ? Dans un monde magiquement coloré de musique, que certains ne
soupçonnent même pas !? Prenez deux lutins, fous d’amour l’un pour
l’autre : Luzel et Libélia, et  un
écureuil malicieux nommé Timus. Ajoutez un énorme danger dissimulé dans une
toute petite boîte, trouvée devant leur toute petite porte ! Vous voilà
parti pour une aventure inoubliable !! 
C’est le voyage de Luzel
et Libélia, à la recherche d’ingrédients, peu ordinaires, pour combattre ce
mal, l’horrible Farfama ! Laissez vous emporter, ce monde vous enchantera !!
Entrez dans la Forêt Chanteuse, l’ancêtre de tous les arbres y abrite le Vieux
Papi, roi des claquettes, aux multiples secrets !! Osez vous approchez du
lac bouillonnant. Saperlipopette ! Vous ne rêvez pas : voici bien un
champignon qui sort d’un lac et, qui en dit long dans son fond ! Et
Florisse, un drôle de petit lutin farfelu, qui décidément se passionne pour les
fleurs et les « SACS à PAPIER » ! Puis vient le moment
d’affronter l’horreur, la pire chose, et cette odeur répugnante qui envahit
l’espace, le manque d’air, les hurlements des profondeurs torturées….
Heureusement il y a
encore la musique ! Mais que se passe-t-il vraiment ? Quel
est le contenu de cette  étrange petite
boîte ? Vous ne le savez toujours pas ?
Entrez, tendez l’oreille,
et regardez… »
Ce conte
musical, les enfants l’adorent. Les parents y sont sensibles aussi. Les
personnages sont haut en couleur, la musique de qualité, variée tantôt douce et
harmonieuse, tantôt jazzy et colorée. Enjoué,  émouvant, drôle, effrayant, il s’est invité
dans les familles, les écoles, et même en 
cours de chant ! En quelques années Les Lutins et le Farfama a trouvé son public et a rencontré un
succès formidable en région toulousaine.L'origine des Lutins et le Farfama.


Je
m’appelle Nadia NELL, et je suis passionnée de musique et des arts en
général  depuis ma plus tendre enfance. A
la suite de mes études (Premier Prix de piano, classes d’écriture, chant…), ma
passion fut entretenue grâce aux rencontres et aux partages avec toute sorte de
musiciens, amateurs ou professionnels, et grâce à la rencontre il y a quelques
années, d’une histoire pour enfant, écrite par une collègue clarinettiste, l’histoire
des Lutins et du Farfama.
L’envie d’écrire des chansons et les idées musicales se sont imposées à moi dès la première lecture. Il
fallait que cette musique jaillisse sur le papier;  l’écriture me rapprochait de mon enfance,
d’un état que j’exprime comme cela :
 Il me reste quelque chose de l’enfance si loin, si proche. Quelque
chose d’évanescent et cependant si présent, à chaque battement de cœur, à toute
respiration nouvelle. Un imaginaire qui vacille entre des mondes malfaisants et
des mondes héroïques, fait de jeux et de peurs, de danses et de combats. De
nombreuses fois, je m’y suis égarée avec délectation. Juste quelques minutes,
parfois des heures entières. 
J’y ai bougé et sculpté des images ; j’ai coloré cet espace
impalpable de mots, de gestes, de sons, de bruits, de musique. Quelque part…
Là, dans cet ailleurs, où tout prend vie : de nos espoirs les plus fous à
nos peurs les plus terrifiantes, où l’impossible n’existe pas… 
Alors cet imaginaire si présent ne
m’a plus laissé le choix. Il me fut dès lors impossible de laisser reposer ce
conte musical naissant dans un tiroir. Le chemin fut long : contacts
divers et variés avec des compagnies de théâtre, des maisons de disques, des
éditeurs… qui sais-je encore ? Les portes sont restées
irrémédiablement  fermées.
Qu’à cela ne tienne ! J’ai
retroussé mes manches, démultiplié mes
énergies et réalisé un CD en 2009 avec une quinzaine de mes amis musiciens,
chanteurs, acteurs. Le CD est édité par l’association Geste et Musique. Ce fut une belle aventure pour chacun d’entre
nous ! Je les remercie encore aujourd’hui du fond du cœur.
Puis ce fut la réalisation du site
internet www.farfama.fr avec
Olivier J. pour la diffusion de l’œuvre. Débordante d’idées, je crée des
supports pédagogiques et des activités créatives pour les enseignants, les
enfants et les familles. De nombreux
retours enthousiasmés d’enfants, de parents et de professeurs des écoles,
m’encouragent à poursuivre le chemin.
De plus, cet imaginaire me taraude
encore et toujours, il est là, je peux presque le toucher, les idées
s’amoncèlent. Alors il faut aller
jusqu’au bout, faire naître le spectacle, la scène. 
A nouveau, je retrousse mes
manches, apprends tout ce qui est lié à la gestion d’entreprise culturelle, et
je me lance : constitution des dossiers, contacts avec les personnalités
du métier, les programmateurs, recherche des acteurs, d’un chorégraphe, d’un régisseur,
etc.… Quelques portes s’ouvrent 
enfin ; des résidences, des dates de programmation. L’accueil est
chaleureux.
Le rêve est presque là.

<h3>We're Baaack!</h3>
<p>As you may have noticed, our first fundraising campaign was a rousing success.  Those generous donations allowed us to secure rehearsal and performance space at the historic Jan Hus Playhouse.  As members of the newly formed Jan Hus Arts Collective, we are thrilled to be working on a stage where such legends as Robin Williams, Jerry Seinfeld, and Barbara Streisand (in her New York debut) once performed. </p>
<p>With our space secured, we were able to assemble an extraordinarily talented group of actors and a production staff we're extremely excited to work with.  This second round of fundraising will be focused on the production itself.  There are still many things to be paid for and with your support we can put the final pieces of the puzzle together! </p>
<p>If you already donated to our first campaign, we (once again) thank you <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">a thousand times</span>!  We would like to make clear that this campaign is a continuation of that one, and that you should feel absolutely no obligation to contribute again - you've already been incredibly generous!

<h3>Aloha from Houston, Texas! A little bit about us...</h3>
<p>We are Halau Ho'ola Ka Mana O Hawai'i, a traditional hula school based in Houston, Texas. The name of the halau (hula school) means, ""Resurrect the power of Hawai'i -- the hula.""  We welcome all to join our halau because it is our belief that anyone with a passion for Hawaiian culture and hula is welcome to learn with us.<br/><br/>In July, we plan to enter Ho'ike Hawai'i, a hula competition being hosted in Orlando, Florida. We will be joining together 3 hula schools based in Houston, Dallas and Oklahoma so that we may compete as one under the direction of Kumu Hula Keli'i Chang, III.

<h3>Fundraising Goal and the Perks for Donors</h3>
<p>We would like to enter this competition with 40 students ranging in age from 10 to 65 years, with many of our students being keiki or children. <br/><br/>Our goal as a group is to raise $15,000 in order to be able to take all of our students with us who wish to compete.  This amount will cover our competition registration fees; ground transportation from Houston and Oklahoma to Florida; lodging; costumes; hula implements and meals.  We are making our own costumes and implements, so your funds will help us with purchasing supplies.<br/><br/>Donors will receive perks ranging from being listed on our website (which is gaining a great deal of exposure in the Houston area) to our highest level donors receiving a photo of our group taken at the competition. Of course, we will be grateful for any level of kokua (help) -- and every donation -- regardless of the amount -- will be met with our deepest gratitude. <br/><br/>Also, we are now a sponsored project of <a href=""http://www.fracturedatlas.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fractured Atlas</a>, a non-profit arts service organization.

Of course, we will be grateful for any level of kokua (help) -- and every donation -- regardless of the amount -- will be met with our deepest gratitude. Also, we are now a sponsored project of Fractured Atlas, a non-profit arts service organization. Contributions for the purposes of Halau Ho'ola Ka Mana O Hawai'i must be made payable to Fractured Atlas and are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law. Please donate online through this campaign or make checks payable to Fractured Atlas and mail to 7601 W. Sam Houston Pkwy S. Unit 650, Houston, TX 77036.


The Impact
Our participation in this competition is one step along our journey to leave a lasting impact on the sharing of Hawaiian culture and values.  In his 30 year career, our Kumu has successfully taught other teachers and participated in hula competitions like the King Kamehameha competition and Merrie Monarch. It is our goal to join the halau on the East Coast in this competition and be a part of the legacy there.  You too can be a part of this legacy when you donate to our Halau!

In September, a dynamic team of producers, designers, technicians, and actors will bring The Forgetting Curve to life for the first time. This world premiere play is inspired in part by the true-life story of Patient HM, who in his teen years underwent an experimental neurosurgery to treat epilepsy, which instead destroyed his brain's ability to form new memories. 
The Forgetting Curve is told through the lens of fictional doctor, Laura Nebbens. While HM hasn't formed a new memory in over 40 years, Dr. Nebbens struggles to reconcile her past. Ahead of receiving a prestigious achievement award in her field, she questions what she sacrificed to leave the legacy of her life's work. Through this Indiegogo campaign, you can help create a memory -- please chip in what you can, and be a part of bringing this fascinating story to Boston.

<h3>WHY?  Because.....</h3>
<p>If I can touch one person, give one person permission to speak up, inspire hope or plant a seed, that is why I love doing this.  I am Laura Grimaldi and this is my story and my experiences with sexual abuse, domestic violence, bad choices and digging myself out from which those trenches engulfed me .  How many times do I have to fall in that hole before I learn to walk around it or better yet, walk on the other side of the street?  As I tell my children, if you can learn from my mistakes even a little bit, then I've done my job well.  I'm just taking that to a bigger scale.  If you can laugh at my mishaps and learn a little something along the way, I will have lived my purpose and executed it in a place I love to be which is on stage. </p>
<p>A little bit about me, I am a California Native.  I was born and raised in Northern California by my mother who stayed at home and worked odd jobs and my ""father"" who was never home.  Yes, quotes are there on purpose.  Mystery story number 1.  I have three children and I lived in Virginia for 18 years, 10 of which were under duress.  That's a whole other story.  I am now living in North Hollywood, CA and I'm married to my third husband, in separate residences.  And that's another story.  See what you're gonna miss if you don't come? </p>
<p>All joking aside, my story touches on very sensitive subjects with a touch of humor and a lot of love.  It's a story in being true and raw and loving the beauties we all are in our own unique way.  Circumstances never matter.  Our world as we perceive it all lies with our state of being in it. </p>

A pure masterpiece"" - Karabo Makenna (Art Director, JHB)</p><p>MODJADJI is not a linear play at all, there are so many stories being told within the piece.  This is a play that strongly engages with themes of drought, violence, rape, replenishment, politics and power; and how they all interlink. The visually gripping and multimedia infused production traces a journey through social, political and cultural views.The characters in the play shift and interchange at all times. The space transforms.

This sense of (re)discovery has had a strong impact on concepts of cultural history in post-Apartheid South Africa. It has meant rediscovering lost facts, redefining principles of historiography, mythology, as well as reinterpreting the old, and ultimately seeking to write a new history. The most fundamental issue of course is to uncover the vast treasure-trove of events and artefacts produced before and during the colonial period, but ignored, denied or undervalued by commentators in the past. </p><p>MODJADJI is an avant-garde contemporary production about current affairs, about life in South Africa today and about our mythologies. We believe that a wider spectrum of African stories deserve to be told, especially the ones that help make sense of what the country and the continent are today.</p><p>MODJADJI matters because A) The Rain Queen is a real life God in South African culture, she is reincarnated in human form and has provided us with life sustaining rain for hundreds of years, yet her story is not often told; and B) it is a proactive attempt by a new generation of theatre makers to shake and push theatre forward into new directions, new subject matters, and new artistic explorations. We believe that by motivating the audience to fund the play, we are reducing dependency from conventional and often colonial funding channels. We want the success of this play to be funded by those who believe in African vision. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536073845/wcftmamclobzghl5jebb.png"" src=""""/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>SO, WHO CREATED THIS?</strong></h3><p>The director, Carla Fonseca, obsessed with telling stories, believes in the power of healing through theatre. Since graduating (BA Theatre &amp; Performance) from the University of Cape Town in 2010, she has focussed her work on South Africa's historical and current societal traumas for nearly a decade.</p><p>Carla is vigorous in helping encourage a stronger theatre &amp; performance art culture within Southern Africa.

A pure masterpiece"" - Karabo Makenna (Art Director, JHB)MODJADJI is not a linear play at all, there are so many stories being told within the piece.  This is a play that strongly engages with themes of drought, violence, rape, replenishment, politics and power; and how they all interlink. The visually gripping and multimedia infused production traces a journey through social, political and cultural views.The characters in the play shift and interchange at all times. The space transforms. There is not one thing that doesn't shift or move. Modjadji deconstructs the mystical rituals, social turmoil, love songs, lullabies and history that all form part of South Africa.""You have healed me, Thank you for such powerful work."" - Warona Seane (Actress, CPT) WHY DOES IT MATTER?Radical changes in political, social and cultural thinking over the past twenty years have significantly affected concepts of historiography and have caused major re-evaluations of accepted histories and mythologies across the world. This sense of (re)discovery has had a strong impact on concepts of cultural history in post-Apartheid South Africa. It has meant rediscovering lost facts, redefining principles of historiography, mythology, as well as reinterpreting the old, and ultimately seeking to write a new history. The most fundamental issue of course is to uncover the vast treasure-trove of events and artefacts produced before and during the colonial period, but ignored, denied or undervalued by commentators in the past. MODJADJI is an avant-garde contemporary production about current affairs, about life in South Africa today and about our mythologies. We believe that a wider spectrum of African stories deserve to be told, especially the ones that help make sense of what the country and the continent are today.MODJADJI matters because A) The Rain Queen is a real life God in South African culture, she is reincarnated in human form and has provided us with life sustaining rain for hundreds of years, yet her story is not often told; and B) it is a proactive attempt by a new generation of theatre makers to shake and push theatre forward into new directions, new subject matters, and new artistic explorations. We believe that by motivating the audience to fund the play, we are reducing dependency from conventional and often colonial funding channels. We want the success of this play to be funded by those who believe in African vision.  SO, WHO CREATED THIS?The director, Carla Fonseca, obsessed with telling stories, believes in the power of healing through theatre. Since graduating (BA Theatre & Performance) from the University of Cape Town in 2010, she has focussed her work on South Africa's historical and current societal traumas for nearly a decade.Carla is vigorous in helping encourage a stronger theatre & performance art culture within Southern Africa. Her work includes a variety of media to achieve her creative objectives. She draws most of her inspiration from personal experiences, street art, lowbrow art, African tradition and global affairs. Her zeal lies within Avant Garde theatre and installation based performance artIn this production, her latest work, she decided to invite a group of brilliant minds together to workshop and develop her idea. It took nearly three years to put together. The ensemble includes Mandla Mbothwe as co-director, Nthato Mokgata (Spoek Mathambo) as sound designer, Iman Isaacs as choreographer and performer, Indalo Stofile, Richard September, and TJ Ngoma as performers and Ryno Keet as lighting designer. Needless to say, the show is a great success onstage because of the unprecedented collaboration which drives it.  WHY DO WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT?“It takes a village to make a theatre production...” Okay, it doesn’t go exactly like that… But, for independent theatre makers, it's really not that different. Over the past 3 years producer and director, Carla Fonseca has saved all she could, with two small sponsorships along the way, to make MODJADJI come alive. She has lost some money in the process, but she remains committed and dedicated to the vision. The team has workshopped and recreated the script over and over to find creative ways of saving money without compromising the quality and vision they have. We have a product, and we want to share it. And sharing it means booking rehearsal venues, booking flights, booking accommodation for cast/crew, feeding tummies, paying artist fee's (at industry standard), hiring theatres, paying for marketing, and making this show come alive again. We have approached sponsors and we hope that they will throw some coins at us, but lets be real, the corporates don't sponsor theatre....so we need your support to achieve the $17 000 we lack in our budget. Please join us in this dream and help us make bring the great production to Johannesburg (first) and then the rest of the globe. Believe in us.  WHERE DOES YOUR CONTRIBUTION GO?See below how we'll use the funds raised during the campaign. This budget will cover 1 month pre-prod, 2 week rehearsal and 1 week run. Seven days a week. HOW ELSE CAN YOU HELP?Share the campaign as much as you can (don’t forget to include a link to this page)! Talk to your friends, colleagues and family about our production MODJADJI, the campaign and how we hope to contribute to South African theatre and the development of young theatre makers! Mention MODJADJI on your social networks, website, blog, vlog, vine or however you express your creativity. Take a megaphone and walk around your neighborhood encouraging every person you see to join us!

<h3>Help us put on this show!</h3>
<p>Students at Santa Clara High School have been begging their teacher to let them choose a dramatic show for the Spring Musical and this year he's given them a deal; Next to Normal in the Fall if they can raise the money on time.</p>
<p>For a lot of us, this show has been an inspiration and helped us find our passion in theatre. To be able to actually perform this show would be the dream and opportunity of a lifetime, not to mention a chance to expand our range as actors.</p>
<p>So, in the mood to help some young aspiring actors?</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Where's All this Money Going?</h3>
<p>Every cent of that $1,500 will be going to purchasing the rights to even perform the show. We already have the SCHS theater reserved and things like costumes and set will be donated from parents or recycled from previous shows.</p>
<p>We'll offer tickets to the show to anyone who donates $3 or more. We'll also offer video recordings of any song of your choice from Next to Normal, bows,  and any donation will get you a shoutout in our program letting everyone else know what a saint you are for helping us!</p>
<p>In the unfortunate event that we don't reach our goal in time combined with what we might earn in physical donations, the profits from this campaign will be going towards our Spring Musical How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. We already have money set aside for the rights of that show, but unfortunately, we need $4,000 just to use the pit in our theater.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If this were to pull through, it would mean the world to everyone involved; the actors, musicians, conductor, even our teacher. The chance to do a musical of this extremely high calibur is such an honor and will probably be the most valuable experience any of us will have as actors in our high school career.</p>
<p>This is our first time raising money for a show because of recent budget cuts, but we will all work our butts off to do this show!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that not everyone interested may be able to donate, but please spread the word and help make the people around you aware of our cause. You might just make a new friend based off a newfound mutual interest!</p>
<p>Please help make our dream come true!</p>

The Crown and Scepter Theater Company is a brand new Columbia student-run theatre organization not yet recognized by the university. This is our first semester and first production. It is a company made of a lot of heart and an unending enthusiasm for bringing great theatre to Columbia students and the greater New York area. The group is very diverse in artistic talent and brings a fresh vibe to the entire Columbia Community. The company also volunteers its time with Columbia’s Double Discovery Center providing arts based workshops to some of its middle and high school students.




We Have the BEST Pies in London!


Sweeney Todd is a masterwork of American musical theater, a tragicomic free-for-all of blood, guts, laughs, love, lust, greed and sorrow, all told in the dark tones of Stephen Sondheim’s London. Sweeney Todd describes it best when he intones “There's a hole in the world like a great black pit/ And the vermin of the world inhabit it/ And its morals aren't worth what a pig could spit/ And it goes by the name of London.” We want to show you that place, not because it is exotic, but because iniquity abounds in all cities, not least in New York, and what we see in Sweeney we also see to one extent or another in our own lives. For the fan of Shakespeare and the Greeks, the character of Sweeney Todd is a tragic hero, sympathetic to start but who twists and warps into someone altogether different as the show progresses; a maniacal beast who gets his final comeuppance when he learns the true fate of his wife. For the fan of spectacle, there is no shortage of that here. From the moment Sweeney Todd has his first taste of blood, slitting the fraud Pirelli’s throat and stuffing his still writhing body into a wooden chest, he cannot stop his horrible, incessant need to kill. The audience will be treated to meat pies made of priests, lines of dying customers, and lots of bloody, bloody business. The Crows and Sceptor Theater Company presents to you a cast of top-notch performers from Columbia University, a full orchestra hailing from The Juilliard School to Hofstra to Columbia University, directed by Joseph Rozenshtein and conducted by Mitchell Feinberg. So without further ado, we invite you to “Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd”!

<h3>The Play</h3>
<p>The Boy in the Church is a modernized retelling of The Hunchback of Notre Dame that takes place in the Great-Depression-era, deep south. This play critically analyzes the race relations of the time, while also drawing parallels to our most pressing, contemporary issues. The story follows aspiring writer, Peter Gorenstein, through his journey into small-town Alabama, where he meets the shadowy figures of the Sheriff and the Reverend, a beautiful African-American dancer named Estelle, and Q, the rumored “boy in the church.” The text raises the question of how much has really changed in the last 75 years?  </p>

<h3>We need your help! </h3>
<p>We are proud that show had impact enough to be asked to return to the stage. To ensure that the production meets its full potential, we are asking for donations to contribute to the overall production budget. Due to the nature of a tour, not only will fundraising efforts contribute to sets, costumes, and promotional materials, but in addition each donation will offset hotels and transportation.  Even a little can go a long way, and each cent is appreciated.</p>

<h3><font color=""#990000"" size=""6"">All About Us!!!</font></h3>
<p>We are a small theatre company with a great product! Great Expectations is our latest adaptation and it went down a storm in theatres and arts centres in the UK and Ireland last Autumn. Now we want to tour it again this spring. We have the tour booked and the play cast but we need funding to help cover our staggering production costs! Touring is an expensive business. Fuel and accommodation are not cheap. Things go wrong on tours; cars break down (twice), computers get run over (yes that happened too), actors get ill (and need replacing with less than 24 hours notice). All of these things happened last autumn and our contingency fund was not deep enough to cover it. We took a big hit. This spring we need the tour to work (which it will with a little support ) in order to get back on our feet and take the company to new heights!</p>
<p>PS the contributions are in dollars purely because that's the only currency this website deals in. You give and we will receive the sterling equivalent at the current rate of exchange</p>

<h3><font color=""#993300"" size=""5"">The Impact</font></h3>
<p>This production is both a milestone and a watershed for Hotbuckle as a company . It is commercially extremely viable and is a veritable hit with audiences but if we don't succeed in making this tour happen the company will inevitably fold. </p>
