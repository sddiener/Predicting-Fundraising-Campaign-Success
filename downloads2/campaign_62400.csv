Dear Friend, The U.S. Supreme Court recently heard oral arguments as marriage equality is litigated.  I'd like to take a moment to put into context why marriage equality matters.
Gay, gay, gay.  How many times have we heard it?  Gay, gay, gay.  If a gay individual is talking about his or her life—the thrill of a date experienced, a moment that felt like a threat to one’s safety, the inequity of a job situation, or a verbalization of the loneliness sometimes felt in a moment of isolation, how many times has a gay or lesbian heard in response, ""Why do you have to talk about being gay all the time?""
I know why I talk about it.  Because it can be a matter of life and death.
My gay self started celebrating life differently nine years ago when I met my partner.  But here's a catch: I fell in love with a nonnative.  In the U.S.A. on an H1B visa, he was working in the States while paying his own U.S. taxes, and we were shockingly saddened ten months after his move with a notice from the Department of Homeland Security.  His visa (applied before 9/11 and now transferring his visa post 9/11) was being revoked.  He was facing potential deportment from the United States.
Gay, gay, gay. 
We wanted—needed—marriage equality.  Not a civil union.  Not a gay marriage.  A civil marriage recognized by the federal and state governments that would keep us together and allow us to keep contributing to our society, our community, our neighbors, and our selves. Alas, we traveled long distances for nearly two years before immigrating to Canada where we could live together.
THE REQUEST
The financial realities of needing to move from the States have been fierce.  Our first year we were both unemployed.  It took each of us several years to re-build our careers, slowly, from the bottom all over again.  While I paid for U.S. health care for a while as an ex-pat, it was not financially possible for long.  Because marriage equality was not offered in the States, we lost our house, our careers, and our health care. 
While Canada does provide national health care, wait times can be a challenge.  So can access to particular specialists because of Canada’s limited population.  While the States has a population of 330 million, Canada is one of 33 million.  There are few family doctors and far fewer specialists.
It can be in Canada's interest to delay treatment.
Recently, I was diagnosed with a brain tumor.  While benign, it is also life threatening.   I have spent two months trying to see various specialists in Toronto and gotten access to one, who determined it would be six to twelve months before I could receive my necessary surgical treatment.  Wait times are long.  Others have larger tumors.  And, primarily, given the rarity of this particular type of tumor, there are exceptionally few neurosurgeons and radiosurgeons who know how to treat it.  
But over the past year, balance issues emerged and intensified, and I have become further symptomatic, with tinnitus in my left ear that has grown resounding.  It took me the past seven months of working my way through the Canadian system to get diagnosed with a rare brain tumor that rests along a series of nerves that regulate balance, hearing, and facial function.  I have what's called an acoustic neuroma, with 1 out of every 100,000 individuals identified annually.
After sending my MRIs to a half dozen neurosurgeons in the States, all of them indicate that I need treatment sooner rather than later.
This whole time, as I've been coping with understanding my diagnosis, I kept having this gnawing feeling of ""If only.""  If only my partner hadn't lost his visa through no fault of his own.... If only we hadn't moved from the States....If only the United States had marriage equality, we would still have had insurance, still had treatment coverage, and still had options.  Granted, issues of U.S. insurance navigation, in-network/out-of-network situations, deductibles, and too many people underinsured or with no insurance, U.S. health care is not ideal.  But I'm convinced that if we still were living in the United States---but are not because of the lack of marriage equality---I would have been diagnosed sooner (preserving more of my hearing), the tumor would have been smaller (more treatment approaches would be possible), and the financial consequences would not be so devastating.

But to do this, I have to pay out-of-pocket for my hospital care, a procedure that will cost up to $30,000.
THE IMPACT
To my Canadian friends, I want to make clear:  we thank you for the refuge you have shown us, and we know my post-treatment care will be provided with love and success in this compassionate country.  We're thankful this country has extended marriage equality for nearly 10 years now.
To those individuals in States where there is not marriage equality, I encourage you to contact your representative and explain that real lives are affected with decisions that they make.  These are decisions that have little consequence on their own lives but huge implications on the lives of others.   My reality recently has been about understanding acoustic neuromas, learning about how to treat and finance one, and not giving up hope that my partner and I can have the freedom and choice to come home.   Many people have asked how they can help.  You could help in two meaningful ways. The first of which is to use the power of your vote and your voice and influence change in the United States by encouraging marriage equality with your congressional leaders.  Show your support of us by voicing your support to your representative.
 Second--and I ask reluctantly—you can make a donation, with my sincerest gratitude, here on Indiegogo.  If you opt to contribute to the cause, your meaningful support will go a long way to defer some of our costs.   Times are tight, reasons are real--for all of us--so the gist of this request is to ask for your support on my marriage and help support me physically, emotionally, and financially.    If you’re not able to make a financial donation right now, please at least use your voice to contact our congressional leaders and demand their support. My partner and I appreciate your place in the world.   No matter what people call our marriage, it's very real to us and as we have faced this challenging moment, it's reminded us of our marriage vows:  till death do us part.  Thankfully, we suspect we won't be parting ways for a long, long time and look forward to equality in the very near future.  And we look forward to further sharing our lives with you--and your life with us!

<h2>My Story</h2>
<p>My name is Sandra Londino. I am a doula, childbirth educator, registered nurse, certified nurse midwife, and OBGYN nurse practitioner. I have 2 great kids - Paloma is 14 and Samson is 12, and we live in Ithaca, New York.</p>
<p>After I gave birth for the first time I realized I wanted to be involved with helping women and their families experience birth in a loving and nurtured way. Out of this realization grew my desire to help empower women through personalized midwifery and well-woman care, education, and support.</p>
<p>I have been a clinician at Planned Parenthood of the Southern Finger Lakes for almost a year, and while I have greatly enjoyed and benefited from my experiences there, I would like to return to my original goal of providing midwifery care in childbirth. I am also passionate about offering personalized, holistic, and respectful well-woman care.</p>
</div>
<h2>Philosophy and model of care</h2>
<p>As a midwife, I focus on promoting the health and well-being of women and newborns through respectful, compassionate, and evidence-based care that acknowledges the inherent power and wisdom in women’s bodies. I believe that all people have a right to quality health care that respects their dignity and individuality, accurate information that allows active participation in decision-making, and family involvement as desired. The normalcy of women’s biological events is acknowledged by a “high touch, low tech” model of care that emphasizes the therapeutic use of human connection and communication, while appropriately utilizing interventions and technology only when necessary. I provide health care to women throughout the life-cycle: preconception counseling, prenatal care, labor and birth, postpartum care, newborn care, well-woman exams, family planning, menopause, and general health counseling.</p>
<p>I believe that birth is a normal, yet life-changing event, and the best outcomes for mother and baby are achieved with attentive, personalized, and home-based care. The evidence for safety and satisfactory outcomes in home birth is widespread and growing. Women and their families need to have the opportunity to choose midwifery care where and when they desire it.</p>
<p>I believe that menstruation, pregnancy, birth, and menopause are not illnesses. I feel strongly that only medically complicated situations should be managed medically, and that the vast majority of women will go through these natural life stages without complications or problems. I believe and trust that the female body is designed perfectly to prepare for and give birth without outside interference. I affirm the power and strength of women and the importance of their health in the well-being of families, communities, and nations. <strong></strong></p>
<p>I support and welcome clients regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, age, race, ethnicity, physical ability, or religion. All services are provided in a respectful, compassionate, and professional manner.</p>
<h2>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<div>
<p>I need your help to get Birthroot Midwifery and Women's Health off the ground. Money that you donate will help me to purchase needed supplies and equipment and ensure that I have a well-equipped, clean, and accessible office where I can see clients for prenatal visits and well-woman care. All of the following (and more!) are needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>medical supplies: gloves, gauze, alcohol wipes, bandages, instruments, IV tubing, supplies, and fluids, resuscitation supplies and equipment, emergency medications, underpads, syringes and needles, suturing equipment and supplies, thermometer, doppler ultrasound, blood pressure cuff, adult and newborn stethoscopes, adult scale, baby scale, speculums, urine dip sticks, microscope and supplies, sharps containers, etc.</li>
<li>office supplies: copy/fax machine, file cabinets, file folders, client charts, forms for charts, appointment cards, business cards, envelopes, paper, printer ink, checks, etc.</li>
<li>educational materials: posters, handouts, books, DVDs, anatomy models, etc</li>
<li>marketing: website, promotional materials</li>
</ul>
<p>Your donation will help me acquire these much needed supplies. Also, I hope to be able to provide care and services to women in my community at a low cost - so I need your help! Every single donation helps, no matter how small. Even if I don't reach my funding goal, Birthroot is already on its way towards providing women in this community with a much-needed service - it might just take me a little longer!</p>
<p>Donate $100 and get your first well-woman exam FREE! Donate $50 and receive a FREE pre-conception counseling visit. See the side bar to the right for other great perks!</p>
</div>
<h2>The Impact of Midwifery Care is Real</h2>
<div>Maternal and infant mortality and morbidity rates are constantly rising in the United States, along with unnecessary and avoidable c-sections and inductions. More mothers and babies die in U.S. hospitals than in many third-world countries, yet the medical establishment in the U.S. continues to go the wrong way toward more and more interference with the natural process – the very thing that is causing the problems.<br/> Home birth with midwives, however, continues to have a very high level of proven safety. Countries that use the most midwives have the best outcomes. Midwifery care consistently results in statistically safer births, less use of traumatic interventions, and higher maternal satisfaction. Research shows that midwives are the safest care providers for the majority of women with normal pregnancies and births!</div>
<div>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>I understand that not everyone has money to contribute -- but there are other ways to help!</p>

<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
<h3 class=""Normal1"">
<strong>An in-water wearable monitor to make</strong><strong> swimming safer and more enjoyable</strong>
</h3>
<p class=""Normal1"">The SEAL wearable swim monitor and drowning detection system offers an extra layer of protection.   It issues accurate and unmistakable warnings and alarms to lifeguards and parents so that they can overcome distractions to respond to a swimmer in distress before medical complications or drowning ensues. Drowning is the #1 cause of traumatic death for children under the age of 5, and the #2 cause of accidental death for all kids in the United States. In this extraordinary age of technology, isn’t it time to bring wireless applications to the swimming pool?</p>
<h3><img alt=""The SEAL Swim Monitoring and Drowning Detection System"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/747436/pictures/full/20130410073517-SEAL_system_large.png?1365604523"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""The SEAL Swim Monitoring and Drowning Detection System""/></h3>
<h3> </h3>
</div>
<h3 class=""Normal1"">How the SEAL works</h3>
<div>Using its patented SwimSafe™ technology, the SEAL system creates a virtual safety network between swimmers, guards, and parents by wirelessly connecting wearable swimmer and guard/parent bands through a compact, portable monitoring hub. Each swimmer band continually reports the swimmer’s status to both the central hub and to the guard/parent band, and each band contains a unique electronic signature so many swimmers can be simultaneously monitored.</div>

<p class=""Normal1"">After completing a fully functioning prototype and then developing an attractive enclosure that has the right form and fit, the company is now in the design for manufacture process ahead of its commercial release later this year in 2013.  </p>
<h3 class=""Normal1""><strong>Detection is the key</strong></h3>
<p class=""Normal1"">If the system detects a swimmer in distress, interim warnings followed by a high-intensity audio, visual, and vibrating alarm are triggered on the swimmer band(s), the guard/parent band(s) and the central hub. The SEAL also incorporates warning and full-alert alarms in the event of power failure, out-of-range signal failure, or if a swimmer has unclasped his or her band. Once in warning or alarm state, The SEAL system requires the applicable swimmers to tap the central hub, close the loop, and confirm all is well. Every device in the system is aware of, and will report, the absence of any other device, which means the SEAL is fault-tolerant and fail-safe in helping parents and lifeguards to be more reliable and responsive than they are today.</p>
<h3 class=""Normal1""><strong>Guards are swimmers too</strong></h3>
<p class=""Normal1"">Clicking a special orange front cover onto a band instantly configures that band to be notified of every activity and alarm on all the other bands, allowing a parent or guard to swim and move about the pool while simultaneously keeping track of the status of each swimmer connected to its system. Best of all, it protects the wearer too by notifying the hub and other guard bands if they become a swimmer in distress. Since the band covers are interchangeable, the SEAL can be configured with any ratio of swim and guard bands to support all possible scenarios.</p>
<h3 class=""Normal1""><strong>The most effective way to prevent drowning is to learn to swim</strong></h3>
<p class=""Normal1"">Most pool alarms on the market today signal if someone has fallen into the water, with the goal of keeping people safe by restricting access to the pool. But it’s hard to learn to swim without getting wet. The SEAL system lets swimmers play, jump, dive, and even hold their breath yet remain safe in the water while wearing a comfortable, wireless swim band.  <img alt=""Swimmers Wearing the SEAL"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/758093/pictures/full/20130415105601-girls_and_bands.png?1366048568"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Swimmers Wearing the SEAL""/></p>
</div>
<h3 class=""Normal1""><strong>Safety never takes a holiday</strong></h3>
<p class=""Normal1"">The SEAL is portable and powered with long-lasting rechargeable batteries in all devices. It can monitor your backyard pool or travel with you on vacations, to your friend's house, to your community pool, or your swim club. The entire system is compact enough to toss into a pool bag. </p>
<h3 class=""Normal1""><strong>Comfort is king</strong></h3>
<p class=""Normal1"">Human factors and ergonomics were judiciously considered and validated to ensure that swimming fun is uninhibited by the band. The SEAL bands are adjustable and comfortable to wear. Swimmers who have tested the band confirm that it is unnoticeable and doesn’t restrict their strokes -- or their silliness.</p>
<h3 class=""Normal1""><strong>Expandable as you add swimmers</strong></h3>
<p class=""Normal1"">Families and swim clubs grow. The SEAL system can grow as well. Additional bands and hubs can be added to the SEAL system to ensure protection of your expanding family or swim club. We have also designed a commercial version that can safeguard large numbers of swimmers at one location or travel site.</p>
<h3 class=""Normal1""><strong>Every swimmer is different</strong></h3>
<p class=""Normal1"">A single family, or swim facility, can contain a wide range of swimming abilities. The SEAL swimmer band can be set to four distinct levels, from acting as an immersion alarm for the non-swimmer (triggering the moment the band submerges in water), all the way to the highest level for safeguarding elite swimmers or triathletes. Adult recreational swimmers, rehabilitation patients, and active seniors can maintain their exercise regimen with the peace of mind that they, too, have the SEAL on their side.</p>

</div></div>","Overview

An in-water wearable monitor to make swimming safer and more enjoyable

The SEAL wearable swim monitor and drowning detection system offers an extra layer of protection.   It issues accurate and unmistakable warnings and alarms to lifeguards and parents so that they can overcome distractions to respond to a swimmer in distress before medical complications or drowning ensues. Drowning is the #1 cause of traumatic death for children under the age of 5, and the #2 cause of accidental death for all kids in the United States. In this extraordinary age of technology, isn’t it time to bring wireless applications to the swimming pool?

 

How the SEAL works
Using its patented SwimSafe™ technology, the SEAL system creates a virtual safety network between swimmers, guards, and parents by wirelessly connecting wearable swimmer and guard/parent bands through a compact, portable monitoring hub. Each swimmer band continually reports the swimmer’s status to both the central hub and to the guard/parent band, and each band contains a unique electronic signature so many swimmers can be simultaneously monitored.

Stage of Development


After completing a fully functioning prototype and then developing an attractive enclosure that has the right form and fit, the company is now in the design for manufacture process ahead of its commercial release later this year in 2013.  
Detection is the key
If the system detects a swimmer in distress, interim warnings followed by a high-intensity audio, visual, and vibrating alarm are triggered on the swimmer band(s), the guard/parent band(s) and the central hub. The SEAL also incorporates warning and full-alert alarms in the event of power failure, out-of-range signal failure, or if a swimmer has unclasped his or her band. Once in warning or alarm state, The SEAL system requires the applicable swimmers to tap the central hub, close the loop, and confirm all is well. Every device in the system is aware of, and will report, the absence of any other device, which means the SEAL is fault-tolerant and fail-safe in helping parents and lifeguards to be more reliable and responsive than they are today.
Guards are swimmers too
Clicking a special orange front cover onto a band instantly configures that band to be notified of every activity and alarm on all the other bands, allowing a parent or guard to swim and move about the pool while simultaneously keeping track of the status of each swimmer connected to its system. Best of all, it protects the wearer too by notifying the hub and other guard bands if they become a swimmer in distress. Since the band covers are interchangeable, the SEAL can be configured with any ratio of swim and guard bands to support all possible scenarios.
The most effective way to prevent drowning is to learn to swim
Most pool alarms on the market today signal if someone has fallen into the water, with the goal of keeping people safe by restricting access to the pool. But it’s hard to learn to swim without getting wet. The SEAL system lets swimmers play, jump, dive, and even hold their breath yet remain safe in the water while wearing a comfortable, wireless swim band.  

Safety never takes a holiday
The SEAL is portable and powered with long-lasting rechargeable batteries in all devices. It can monitor your backyard pool or travel with you on vacations, to your friend's house, to your community pool, or your swim club. The entire system is compact enough to toss into a pool bag. 
Comfort is king
Human factors and ergonomics were judiciously considered and validated to ensure that swimming fun is uninhibited by the band. The SEAL bands are adjustable and comfortable to wear. Swimmers who have tested the band confirm that it is unnoticeable and doesn’t restrict their strokes -- or their silliness.
Expandable as you add swimmers
Families and swim clubs grow. The SEAL system can grow as well. Additional bands and hubs can be added to the SEAL system to ensure protection of your expanding family or swim club. We have also designed a commercial version that can safeguard large numbers of swimmers at one location or travel site.
Every swimmer is different
A single family, or swim facility, can contain a wide range of swimming abilities. The SEAL swimmer band can be set to four distinct levels, from acting as an immersion alarm for the non-swimmer (triggering the moment the band submerges in water), all the way to the highest level for safeguarding elite swimmers or triathletes. Adult recreational swimmers, rehabilitation patients, and active seniors can maintain their exercise regimen with the peace of mind that they, too, have the SEAL on their side.

<p class=""MsoNormal"">An amazing woman in pain</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">My name is Dannette Tillery and I come to you today as a Daughter worried about her mother’s health. I know a lot of people out there say they have the best mom, but I know I do. She has worked her whole life to take care of me and my 2 brothers and she even took care of my critically ill father, home schooled myself and my little brother while working 2 jobs. It hurts to lose one parent and watch them go through pain and it's another thing to worry about the only one you have left in this world, I was a little girl when I lost my father to lung cancer, but I'm an adult now and I want to fight for my mother’s health and well-being. She has no health insurance and cannot go to the hospital for the test that the doctors have told her she needs to get; they suspect that she has MS (Multiple Sclerosis) or RA. We were running a cleaning business but do to the fact that it hurts her to walk and mostly everything else we had to let it go so my brother and I are looking to take on new jobs to keep up on our High mortgage payments and expense, but I do not want to play with my mother’s health and I fear and break down with tears when I think of her being in pain but pushing on.

<p>The MilestonePod - for runners, by runners</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial; font-size: large; font-weight: 100; color: #999999; line-height: 140%;"">The new MilestonePod (<strong><em>patent pending</em></strong>) allows you to passively track the mileage logged on your running shoes so they can be replaced at the correct time, not too soon (wasting valuable tread) and not too late (potentially causing injury). Although your shoes may continue to look new, the constant pounding from running causes the materials to wear down and stop providing support and protection. This reduction in shock absorption often leads to injury.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial; font-size: large; font-weight: 100; color: #999999; line-height: 140%;"">It sounds simple but let's face it, do you really track the mileage on your shoes? As runners ourselves, we have multiple GPS watches, devices and mobile applications that track individual runs and training.  Yet despite training for multiple marathons and Ironmans we have failed to accurately track shoe mileage. This inexpensive device (only $14.95 suggested retail) completely eliminates any worry about when to retire your shoes - your knees, hips and ankles are now much safer!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial; font-size: large; font-weight: 100; color: #999999; line-height: 140%;"">When you purchase your new pair of shoes just lace the MilestonePod to your sneakers and leave it alone.  Over the coming weeks and months it will track every mile you run and provide a constant read-out of the total miles. You can then replace your shoes at the mileage you desire (typically between 400-600) and move the MilestonePod to the new pair of shoes.  A USB connection allows you to wipe the mileage clean and start fresh with your next pair of shoes.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial; font-size: large; font-weight: 100; color: #999999; line-height: 140%;"">But that is not all... many runners have allergies, take medications and have other bits of information that might be critical for an emergency responder to know. The MilestonePod allows you to input emergency information (blood type, medical history and more) that can be accessed by simply plugging it in to any USB enabled computer or device. It is different from existing bracelet and anklet IDs because it is always attached to your shoe (ever forget your bracelet?), the information can be changed or augmented anytime and you can include much more information.</span></p>

<h1><strong><span style=""font-family: arial; font-size: x-large; font-weight: 100; color: #000000;"">The Process</span></strong></h1>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial; font-size: large; font-weight: 100; color: #999999; line-height: 140%;"">Our team has led design and development of complex hardware projects such as the Microsoft Kinect (the most successful consumer product launch ever) as well as high-end virtual reality goggles used by the military. We have completed many of the critical steps for bringing the MilestonePod to market including rigorously analyzing the bill of materials, completing manufacturing drawings, aligning design and manufacturing facilities and developing a comprehensive production plan. So how will we use the funds you contribute via Indiegogo? Below are the major steps:</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial; font-size: large; font-weight: 100; color: #999999; line-height: 140%;"">Design and build an enclosure: As you can see from the pictures we have designed the device itself and have produced early models. We will use part of the funds we raise to develop mass production capabilities to ensure we minimize manufacturing costs.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial; font-size: large; font-weight: 100; color: #999999; line-height: 140%;"">Layout electronics: As we have done with past projects, our first step with the MilestonePod was to develope the requirements for the electronics and the build prototype units. We have completed the layout of the actual smaller electronics boards (PCBs) that will be used in the MilestonePod.  Our final step is to optimize the design and prepare for mass production. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial; font-size: large; font-weight: 100; color: #999999; line-height: 140%;"">Algorithm development: We have already developed and tested advanced algorithms for capturing movement and accurately recording distance. The algorithms must be ported to the final electronics and optimized on the finished product. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial; font-size: large; font-weight: 100; color: #999999; line-height: 140%;"">To summarize, the system has been fully designed, the core functionality has been built and tested, the industrial design is complete, manufacturing partners have been identified and algorithms have been developed. We are turning to you through Indiegogo to help fund some of the initial investment required to help make this vision come alive and provide runners a much needed product.</span></p>

<h1>The Team</h1>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial; font-size: large; font-weight: 100; color: #999999; line-height: 140%;"">Our team is comprised of committed athletes, technologists and entrepreneurs. The mission of Milestone is to leverage the wide availability of sensors and other technologies to bring low cost, high value sensor-based products to the casual sports world. Our initial product is the MilestonePod and we will follow this first release with new versions of the MilestonePod and products for other sports.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial; font-size: large; font-weight: 100; color: #999999; line-height: 140%;"">During our training for various road races and triathlons we noticed that despite our GPS watches, mobile training apps and other running peripherals there were a few items we still could not easily track. So we built a device. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial; font-size: large; font-weight: 100; color: #999999; line-height: 140%;"">Here we are:</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: arial; font-size: large; font-weight: 100; color: #999999; line-height: 140%;"">Tzach has been in the endurance sport business for the last 16 years. He has completed a dozen marathons, two IronMans and has been a part of teams for adventure racing around the globe. He owns a chain of retail stores for endurance sports and therefore has tremendous knowledge of the needs of runners and other athletes. Tzach regularly responds to runners everyday questions including the big problem  - ""When do I need to replace my running shoes?"" Tzach brings to Milestone 20 years of experience in starting and growing businesses.<br/> <br/>Meir has been enthusiastic about triathlons and running for more than 15 years. He is a four-time IronMan finisher and has completed many marathons - with a 2:48 PR. Until now, Meir feels he has been too lazy/busy to log the mileage of his shoes (though he owns every GPS watch ever made), and has just used one pair at a time for too long. Meir has managed technology projects for the last 15 years, holding executive R&amp;D positions. He was the first R&amp;D manager of the technology for the Microsoft Kinect sensor. As a serious runner and technology enthusiast, Meir is the perfect fit to bring this idea to reality.<br/><br/>Jason has been an avid runner for the past 12 years.  He has completed six marathons and numerous half marathons and other races. Jason always alternates shoes when training and has never been able to consistently count mileage on any given pair. Jason has been in executive management, sales, business development and marketing for technology start-up companies for the past 17 years. He has been a part of companies that have gone from  pre-revenue to IPO and some that did not succeed. He would like to think he has learned a thing or two about succesfully launching a company along the way.</span></p>

Studies show that the life of a running shoe is between 400 - 600 miles, after which the cushioning and support breaks down leading to many common injuries.   
Think for a minute about your current running shoes.  Do you know how many miles are on them?  Are you putting yourself at risk for injury? Don't you wish you could easily track those miles so you never have that dead-shoe feeling again?
Let the MilestonePod track your running shoe miles for you! No more cumbersome training logs, no more guessing and no more math.  Simple, easy to read digital display shows how many miles your shoes have gone. 
 

 
 
Real World Runner ""Buzz"":
""I don't usually think about buying new shoes until my hip starts hurting. That's too late. I can't wait to automatically and continuously know the mileage on my shoes."" Dr. Scott Laborwit, opthalmic surgeon,  Boston and Philly Marathon finisher, multiple half-Ironman finisher.
""My shoes are critical to my training and preparation. The MilestonePod will definitely help me remain fresh and injury free, not  to mention the data tag feature eases my mind as I have a serious bee allergy."" David Anshen, ranked 18th nationally in the 40-44 age group for duathalons
""I am really excited to offer the MilestonePod to our customers. The device will help minimize injuries during running and the digital tag can be a life saver if there is ever an emergency.

The MilestonePod - for runners, by runners
 
The new MilestonePod (patent pending) allows you to passively track the mileage logged on your running shoes so they can be replaced at the correct time, not too soon (wasting valuable tread) and not too late (potentially causing injury). Although your shoes may continue to look new, the constant pounding from running causes the materials to wear down and stop providing support and protection. This reduction in shock absorption often leads to injury.
It sounds simple but let's face it, do you really track the mileage on your shoes? As runners ourselves, we have multiple GPS watches, devices and mobile applications that track individual runs and training.  Yet despite training for multiple marathons and Ironmans we have failed to accurately track shoe mileage. This inexpensive device (only $14.95 suggested retail) completely eliminates any worry about when to retire your shoes - your knees, hips and ankles are now much safer!
When you purchase your new pair of shoes just lace the MilestonePod to your sneakers and leave it alone.  Over the coming weeks and months it will track every mile you run and provide a constant read-out of the total miles. You can then replace your shoes at the mileage you desire (typically between 400-600) and move the MilestonePod to the new pair of shoes.  A USB connection allows you to wipe the mileage clean and start fresh with your next pair of shoes.
But that is not all... many runners have allergies, take medications and have other bits of information that might be critical for an emergency responder to know. The MilestonePod allows you to input emergency information (blood type, medical history and more) that can be accessed by simply plugging it in to any USB enabled computer or device. It is different from existing bracelet and anklet IDs because it is always attached to your shoe (ever forget your bracelet?), the information can be changed or augmented anytime and you can include much more information.

Suggested retail price of $14.95
 
The Process
Our team has led design and development of complex hardware projects such as the Microsoft Kinect (the most successful consumer product launch ever) as well as high-end virtual reality goggles used by the military. We have completed many of the critical steps for bringing the MilestonePod to market including rigorously analyzing the bill of materials, completing manufacturing drawings, aligning design and manufacturing facilities and developing a comprehensive production plan. So how will we use the funds you contribute via Indiegogo? Below are the major steps:
Design and build an enclosure: As you can see from the pictures we have designed the device itself and have produced early models. We will use part of the funds we raise to develop mass production capabilities to ensure we minimize manufacturing costs.
Layout electronics: As we have done with past projects, our first step with the MilestonePod was to develope the requirements for the electronics and the build prototype units. We have completed the layout of the actual smaller electronics boards (PCBs) that will be used in the MilestonePod.  Our final step is to optimize the design and prepare for mass production. 
Algorithm development: We have already developed and tested advanced algorithms for capturing movement and accurately recording distance. The algorithms must be ported to the final electronics and optimized on the finished product. 
To summarize, the system has been fully designed, the core functionality has been built and tested, the industrial design is complete, manufacturing partners have been identified and algorithms have been developed. We are turning to you through Indiegogo to help fund some of the initial investment required to help make this vision come alive and provide runners a much needed product.
 
 
 
The Team
Our team is comprised of committed athletes, technologists and entrepreneurs. The mission of Milestone is to leverage the wide availability of sensors and other technologies to bring low cost, high value sensor-based products to the casual sports world. Our initial product is the MilestonePod and we will follow this first release with new versions of the MilestonePod and products for other sports.
During our training for various road races and triathlons we noticed that despite our GPS watches, mobile training apps and other running peripherals there were a few items we still could not easily track. So we built a device. 
Here we are:
Tzach has been in the endurance sport business for the last 16 years. He has completed a dozen marathons, two IronMans and has been a part of teams for adventure racing around the globe. He owns a chain of retail stores for endurance sports and therefore has tremendous knowledge of the needs of runners and other athletes. Tzach regularly responds to runners everyday questions including the big problem  - ""When do I need to replace my running shoes?"" Tzach brings to Milestone 20 years of experience in starting and growing businesses. Meir has been enthusiastic about triathlons and running for more than 15 years. He is a four-time IronMan finisher and has completed many marathons - with a 2:48 PR. Until now, Meir feels he has been too lazy/busy to log the mileage of his shoes (though he owns every GPS watch ever made), and has just used one pair at a time for too long. Meir has managed technology projects for the last 15 years, holding executive R&D positions. He was the first R&D manager of the technology for the Microsoft Kinect sensor. As a serious runner and technology enthusiast, Meir is the perfect fit to bring this idea to reality.Jason has been an avid runner for the past 12 years.  He has completed six marathons and numerous half marathons and other races. Jason always alternates shoes when training and has never been able to consistently count mileage on any given pair. Jason has been in executive management, sales, business development and marketing for technology start-up companies for the past 17 years. He has been a part of companies that have gone from  pre-revenue to IPO and some that did not succeed. He would like to think he has learned a thing or two about succesfully launching a company along the way.
Dotan has completed four marathons in the past two years (the last one was 40 minutes faster than the first one). During these two years he managed to replace more than 10 pair of shoes but usually not until his knees started aching.  In the past 18 years Dotan has managed technology projects in the field of web based applications and services and has managed development of web portal services and traffic management systems. Among the projects that Dotan has led are the NBA 50th Anniversary CD ROM, the official Olympic Committee CD ROM for the Atlanta Olympic Games and a series of real time 3D games.

Camp Pumziko is a national camp that serves multi-gendered youth ages six through seventeen and is a program of Community Aid Development and the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement. The activities offered teach political, cultural and historical subjects while incorporating outdoor camping skills. CAD’s Camp Pumziko has been training youth for twenty years to become activists in their respective communities.  Because the coordinators are veteran liberation movement activists themselves, the young people gain a unique insight into the Civil Rights Movement and the subsequent movements, allowing them to analyze the strengths and challenges of individuals and organizations.We are members of the Community Aid Development (CAD) New Afrikan People's Organization (NAPO), the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement (MXGM), New Afrikan Scouts Organization (NASO) and activists in our communities that teach our youth about wilderness survival, self-determination and sustainability of culture and community from an African-centered perspective, all while having fun! Our staff of volunteers fly and drive in from around the nation to support the consistency and growth of our camp. 
A vast majority of our campers rely on donations and sponsorship from the community to get them to camp. Our entire staff consists of volunteers and a large number of them take off a week from work in order to attend camp. 


That's Why We Need You!
Our goal is $10,000. That amount covers all administrative costs including space, activities, supplies, equipment and food. The camp is fully staffed with volunteers and we have children come from cities around the nation. We have had children and staff attend from Georgia, Mississippi, Lousiana, Texas, Alabama, Michigan, California, Connecticut, NY and more.
 Your donations will help us rent a host camp facility, purchase insurance for the week of camp, buy supplies for activities, procure food and provide scholarships to campers with financial need. 
If we are unable to reach our goal, we will still be able to offer some scholarships to campers in need.

idea:</b></p>
<p>My name is Kevin Stafford and I am a
Registered Marriage and Family Therapist and Psychotherapist in private
practice. I have a passion for helping people with the ordinary and out-of-the-ordinary
problems. I have been in private practice in Guelph, Ontario since 1997 under
the name Hillside Family Therapy.</p>
<p>I want to focus 25% of my practice serving
people who cannot afford to pay private practice fees, do not have access to
insurance coverage, and have no (or limited) benefits through an employee
assistance program.  </p>
<p>Your contribution to the Mental Health Matters
Fund will assist individuals, couples and families to get the help they need
and want but can’t afford.  </p>
<p>The people I want to assist with this fund
are those who want to make meaningful change in their lives but can’t afford to
pay for therapy or whose access to therapy is limiting. </p>
<p>I have over 20 years of experience creating
therapeutic conversations with people to help generate new ideas, alternative
perspectives and possibilities for their lives. I work collaboratively with
people to help them reconnect their lives to the beliefs, ideas and
relationships that matter to them. I also help people to understand the effects
and influences that problems have on their lives and to find possible solutions
for managing and standing against those problems. </p><p><br/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/327617/files/20140124113118-anxiety2.jpg?1390591878"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/327611/files/20140124112744-depression1.jpg?1390591664"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em; width: 219.66867469879517px; height: 165px;""/></p><p></p><br/><p></p>

idea:
My name is Kevin Stafford and I am a
Registered Marriage and Family Therapist and Psychotherapist in private
practice. I have a passion for helping people with the ordinary and out-of-the-ordinary
problems. I have been in private practice in Guelph, Ontario since 1997 under
the name Hillside Family Therapy.
I want to focus 25% of my practice serving
people who cannot afford to pay private practice fees, do not have access to
insurance coverage, and have no (or limited) benefits through an employee
assistance program.  
Your contribution to the Mental Health Matters
Fund will assist individuals, couples and families to get the help they need
and want but can’t afford.  
The people I want to assist with this fund
are those who want to make meaningful change in their lives but can’t afford to
pay for therapy or whose access to therapy is limiting. 
I have over 20 years of experience creating
therapeutic conversations with people to help generate new ideas, alternative
perspectives and possibilities for their lives. I work collaboratively with
people to help them reconnect their lives to the beliefs, ideas and
relationships that matter to them. I also help people to understand the effects
and influences that problems have on their lives and to find possible solutions
for managing and standing against those problems. 
How my Idea will
work:
At its heart this idea creates a three way
partnership to help someone access needed and wanted therapy. 


 The client: contributes
a portion by paying some of the fee, even if it’s only a small amount.


The
Therapist (that’s me): contributes a portion and absorbs all taxes.  


The
Indiegogo funder (that’s you): collectively contributes the remaining or “topped-up”
portion of the fee.


This chart shows how the funds collected will
be used based upon fees paid by the client.



Amount paid in dollars by:




The Client

  Indiegogo Funder

Example:  A client, who can only afford to pay $20.00, will
have their fee “topped up” by $60.00 from the Indiegogo Mental Health Matters Fund
and I would contribute the remaining $30.00. 

Funds will only be used to top up clients after the funds have
been received and will not be used to pay for missed or cancelled appointments.
A record will be kept accounting for the amounts drawn from the
fund. I will post regular updates on how the funds are being used on my website (www.kevinstafford.com) and at the end of the year, I will post a complete accounting
of how the funds were allocated, and how many clients and sessions were
generated. Client confidentiality will be maintained at all times.



With the success of this campaign:With the success of this campaign, a second campaign could
be launched to broaden its reach. The second campaign would bring in more therapists,
who would help provide easier access to therapy for more people who cannot
afford to pay.  Where will clients
come from?

I have a good referral network that consists of family physicians,
colleagues in private practice, a university training program and word of
mouth.

Breakdown of how the funds will be spent and what they will
provide:
My goal is to raise $20,000.00 (CDN). Here is a breakdown
of where the funding will go:


Indiegogo takes 4% (plus 3% on credit card transactions)  


$ 1,800 (est.)




Amount to be used to “top up” reduced fee clients


$18,200




Fund Goal Total


$20,000





The $18,200 will allow
approximately 33 clients access to my therapy services at an average of 12
sessions at an average fee “top-up” of $45.00 per session.

It has effects on work

It has effects socially
because we do not talk enough about mental health, and when someone has a
struggle or problem, people often resort to fear, do not know what to do or say

<h3>Teri's Story</h3>
<p>In addition to being an amazing mother, wife, sister and aunt, Teri Heitman is an extremely loving, caring and courageous woman who will bend over backwards to help anyone in need. She has been a strong advocate for the local theatre community and has greatly impacted the lives of many.  Now is our chance to help her.</p>
<p>Over a year ago, Teri was diagnosed with cancer for a third time.  She had previously battled cervical cancer and anaplastic large cell lymphoma and won.  In 2012 she was diagnosed with an extremely rare, aggressive form of lymphoma called cutaneous gamma-delta T-cell lymphoma (CGD-TCL).  This is a form of skin cancer that creates plaque-like lesions all over her body and has also attacked the nerves in her left arm so she currently has no use of her left hand and is in constant pain.   </p>
<p>In March of this year, after completing a rigorous chemotherapy regimen which lasted several months, it was determined that Teri’s cancer had gone into remission.  Her physicians had made plans to move forward with two separate stem-cell transplants in the hope that these transplants would prevent her lymphoma from returning.</p>
<p>However, in May of 2013, a PET scan reflected that Teri’s cancer had already come back.  Her physicians determined that there was one more chemotherapy combination that she could try, but it did not seem to work.  After regrouping, her oncologist and a team of cutaneous oncologists at Stanford have decided to try one other chemotherapy drug.  In addition, she decided to pursue some alternative therapies to help her fight this battle.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How Can I Help?</h3>
<p>After much research and consulting with friends and loved ones, Teri found two alternative therapies which have been successful in fighting cancer in late stage cancer patients. </p>
<p>One such therapy is a treatment called Transfer Factor Plus, a capsule that helps boost the immune system and enhance chemotherapy treatments.  Teri has already begun the Transfer Factor Plus regimen that seems to be helping with her energy and the skin lesions.</p>
<p>The other therapy involves two different vaccines, a universal vaccine and a customized vaccine, developed by Dr. Kenichiro Hasumi, a physician in Japan who specializes in cancer immunotherapy. </p>
<p>In addition to the two therapies, Teri is currently undergoing chemo and is living in a care facility.  She is extremely weak and needs help doing just about everything.  We would love to bring her home so she could be around her dogs and people that make her happy, but the cost of in-home care is very high and not covered by Medicare. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the in-home care and both therapies are very expensive and are not covered under Teri’s medical insurance.  </p>
<p>In-home care in her area is $20/hour and we feel she would need care 24/7.  That equals $480 per day until she gets her strength back and can start doing things for herself.</p>
<p>Transfer Factor Plus costs around $600 for a two month supply, and the Hasumi Vaccines will cost $150 every month, plus an initial start up cost of roughly $3400 to create a custom vaccine that will help Teri's cells fight with her rather than against her.  Teri will be required to utilize both therapies for an indefinite amount of time. </p>
<p>Thus, our goal is to raise $5000 to assist Teri and her family with payment for these ongoing treatments.  </p>

<h3>What Do I Get?</h3>
<p>Teri has always believed strongly in angels watching over us all and has acted as an angel here on earth to many people.</p>
<p>We would like everyone to become one of ""Teri's Angels"" so anyone that donates will receive one of the following: a beautiful pair of Teri's Angels earrings, key chain, bookmark (examples below) or a beaded spiral suncatcher (not pictured) - designed and hand-crafted by Teri's sister, Judy with help from Teri's daughter, Kristen.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways To Help</h3>
<p>We would be truly grateful for any support you could provide in helping us to achieve this goal, but we understand in this tough economy that may not be possible.  </p>
<p><em>Your kind thoughts, healing vibes and prayer are more than welcome.  </em></p>
<p>Please feel free to share this campaign as well, and, if you or somebody you love is battling cancer and you would like more information on any of these alternative thearapies, please reach out to us using the email address below.</p>
<p>Family and friends (and even the kind words of strangers) can make a huge difference in lifting a person's spirits.  If you would like to send Teri a note, you can do so at <strong><a href=""mailto:terisangels@icloud.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">terisangels@icloud.com</a>.</strong></p>

In March of this year, after completing a rigorous chemotherapy regimen which lasted several months, it was determined that Teri’s cancer had gone into remission.  Her physicians had made plans to move forward with two separate stem-cell transplants in the hope that these transplants would prevent her lymphoma from returning.
However, in May of 2013, a PET scan reflected that Teri’s cancer had already come back.  Her physicians determined that there was one more chemotherapy combination that she could try, but it did not seem to work.  After regrouping, her oncologist and a team of cutaneous oncologists at Stanford have decided to try one other chemotherapy drug.  In addition, she decided to pursue some alternative therapies to help her fight this battle.


How Can I Help?
After much research and consulting with friends and loved ones, Teri found two alternative therapies which have been successful in fighting cancer in late stage cancer patients. 
One such therapy is a treatment called Transfer Factor Plus, a capsule that helps boost the immune system and enhance chemotherapy treatments.  Teri has already begun the Transfer Factor Plus regimen that seems to be helping with her energy and the skin lesions.
The other therapy involves two different vaccines, a universal vaccine and a customized vaccine, developed by Dr. Kenichiro Hasumi, a physician in Japan who specializes in cancer immunotherapy. 
In addition to the two therapies, Teri is currently undergoing chemo and is living in a care facility.  She is extremely weak and needs help doing just about everything.  We would love to bring her home so she could be around her dogs and people that make her happy, but the cost of in-home care is very high and not covered by Medicare. 
Unfortunately, the in-home care and both therapies are very expensive and are not covered under Teri’s medical insurance.  
In-home care in her area is $20/hour and we feel she would need care 24/7.  That equals $480 per day until she gets her strength back and can start doing things for herself.
Transfer Factor Plus costs around $600 for a two month supply, and the Hasumi Vaccines will cost $150 every month, plus an initial start up cost of roughly $3400 to create a custom vaccine that will help Teri's cells fight with her rather than against her.  Teri will be required to utilize both therapies for an indefinite amount of time. 
Thus, our goal is to raise $5000 to assist Teri and her family with payment for these ongoing treatments.  

What Do I Get?
Teri has always believed strongly in angels watching over us all and has acted as an angel here on earth to many people.
We would like everyone to become one of ""Teri's Angels"" so anyone that donates will receive one of the following: a beautiful pair of Teri's Angels earrings, key chain, bookmark (examples below) or a beaded spiral suncatcher (not pictured) - designed and hand-crafted by Teri's sister, Judy with help from Teri's daughter, Kristen.


Other Ways To Help
We would be truly grateful for any support you could provide in helping us to achieve this goal, but we understand in this tough economy that may not be possible.  
Your kind thoughts, healing vibes and prayer are more than welcome.  
Please feel free to share this campaign as well, and, if you or somebody you love is battling cancer and you would like more information on any of these alternative thearapies, please reach out to us using the email address below.
Family and friends (and even the kind words of strangers) can make a huge difference in lifting a person's spirits.  If you would like to send Teri a note, you can do so at terisangels@icloud.com.

A special thank you to Garrett Vander Leun for creating the beautiful Teri's Angels image.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Belén Clean Water Campaign: Providing Education and
Clean Water </strong></p>
<p>We are CGCHealth. We’re working hard to assist the people of the
Peruvian Amazon so they can achieve their community's life goals. Our goal is to
magnify the voices within those communities so they can reach the ears of those
with the power and privilege to help effect the change they wish to see in
their world.</p>
<p>CGCHealth works within existing social structures in Iquitos,
Peru to enact change. We make the needs and wishes of the people the starting
point, working from the bottom-up, while always respecting the local cultures
that are represented within the communities of the Amazon.</p>
<p>CGCHealth conducted a needs assessment in 2012 and met with many
community leaders (Apus and Agentes) within the Amazon. They stated that the
health of the community was a major concern. When asked what they believed the
root of the health problem was they consistently responded, “No tomamos agua
limpia”, “We don’t drink clean water.” So we are starting there: at the root of
the problem.</p>
<p>We are working to solve the root of the health crisis in a
community named Belén.  Belén, located on
the banks of the Itaya River, is a community of nearly 50,000 people whose
voices have been overshadowed and forgotten, their needs have become secondary
to those considered to be of a higher social status and more worthy of proper
attention and aid. The people live happily in their tightly knit communities,
however, and are eager to help themselves reach a future that they desire.</p>
<p>CGCHealth is a tool that can help the people of Belén reach
their goals, their desires, and their futures. We have the power and the
privilege to be in the position to teach free classes on what is asked of us and
use that privilege as an NGO to bring in people from governmental organizations
from all over Iquitos to come teach free classes about how to get a national
ID, prevention of diseases, treatments for common illnesses, how to get clean
water and the list continues to grow.</p>
<p>With the $10,000, CGCHealth members will team up with UNAP
Medical Students to teach a four-day health course to a total of 180 families
of the Belén community throughout the next year. We hope to be able to educate and provide filters to 15 families per month. At the end of each course, the families will receive a
water filter system to implement in their homes. Water should always be free
and clean but the people of Belén need our help to make this a reality. <strong style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> </strong></p>

<p>This Summer, CGCHealth
set out to Iquitos, Peru to initiate a Clean Water Campaign with 50 families in
the small and impoverished communities in Belén. We worked in the Centro de
Salud 6 de Octubre. People with illnesses due to water contamination were offered
a four-day course organized by CGCHealth. Along with the help of students from the
University of Kansas and Medical Students from Universidad Nacional de la
Amazonia Peruana (UNAP) in Iquitos, we educated the families about the symptoms,
prevention, and treatment of illnesses common to Belén. At the end of the
course, each family received a water filter and two buckets to use at home. The
hope was to reach 50 families within the month of June. During the first
week, 5 families showed up, 7 families by the second week, and by the third
week, 150 families showed up with the hope of attending the heath education
course and receiving a filter! This interest far exceeded our expectations or
hopes for this program! All the families had come by word of mouth with an
eagerness and desire to gain a better understanding about their health and the
importance of clean water. We need your help to ensure that no family is denied
access to clean water.  Turning away one
family is one too many.</p>

<p>The people of Belén are enthusiastic and hungry to learn about ways to keep themselves, their families, and their community healthy! Community members continue to ask CGCHealth team members when the next health course will be! CGCHealth hopes to support the desires of the community of Belén and continue the health course the rest of the year, reaching and educating 20 new families each month!</p>
<p>The funding we are asking for will go towards purchasing water filters and buckets for each of these families. This is where we immediately need your help so we can bring the community of Belén what they want and need the most for their health and for their futures—clean water!</p>
<ul>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Clean water is a seriously powerful tool to positively impact the lives of the men, women, and children of Belén. With the $10,000 USD we at CGCHealth can help to bring Belén the health education and clean water they desire! The 80 families CGCHealth has worked with so far have become spokespersons for health and clean water. They have become participants in town hall meetings with the Mayor of Belén, Hermogenes Flores Gomez, to voice their most prevalent needs, concerns, and desires for their community. But, as they say here, Belén RUGE por agua limpia—Belén ROARS for clean water! Neither we nor the community want to stop here! Clean water must be made available to all! It is a human right that must be instilled.</p>

Your contribution will not only bring parents and caretakers peace of mind, but one day, will bring someone home to safety! Avoiding the ""what if's"" we all fear when someone goes missing. In addition, we have given some nice perks and may be adding more! And knowing that you were a ""Silent Partner' in the production of what we hope to be a parental ""Must Have"" should give you pride and also make you feel at least a little bit like a hero. Wait til the first time you hear on the news about a missing child being recovered because of a TrackForce Tracking unit! 


We aren't just making someone's life easier with this product, we are LITERALLY changing what could have been a tragic event into one with minimal harm done. And its People like YOU who have taken the time to read this and watch the video that make the difference! Its YOU that's the hero! Not us. We couldn't do this without you. Plain and simple. So Please donate ANY amount and help us get closer to our goal. That's what this site is all about,making it happen! 
We understand that not everyone is in a position to help But your hearts in the right place. And that speak volumes about you as a person. Maybe you can share this with a few friend or people at work. Remember that Indiegogo has the ""Share Tool"" which would help us get the word out. And Any little bit helps!

<p></p></div>","LiV is an indoor air quality monitoring device.

Use it in your living room
Use it to test the air quality in your bedroom
Use it in your greenhouse: higher levels of CO2 make plants grow bigger and faster 
Use it in your garage: gasoline and diesel engines give off large amounts of CO2
Use it in that small conference room at work


Carbon dioxide or CO2 is a good indicator of indoor air quality. Carbon dioxide is a natural component of air. By volume, dry air contains nitrogen, oxygen, argon, a small amount of carbon dioxide and even smaller quantities of other gases. The amount of CO2 in a given air sample is commonly expressed as parts per million (ppm). The outdoor air in most locations contains about 380 parts per million carbon dioxide.
Inside a building, people and plants are the main sources of CO2. Whenever we exhale, our lungs release CO2. Plants also release CO2 at night due to cellular respiration.Higher levels of indoor CO2 indicate that not enough fresh air got into the building and consequently it is possible that other pollutant and allergenic agents such as Volatile Organic Compounds (e.g. formaldehyde) are also present in the air.  The “heart” of LiV is a sensor expansion board that plugs into a Raspberry Pi. The “brain” of LiV consists of a set of Python scripts that use open source code contributed by the great Raspberry Pi developer community.                  That’s right, LiV is entirely open source: software and hardware!

One of our challenges has been the entire rebrand of what used to be called Bonnie Lush and redirection in the interest of our clients and customers. Sherine had the brand Bonnie Lush since 2012 and realised that she needed to break a sentimental tie in order to create the brand Ivy Wild.
We aspire to reach more people all over the world with our products as well as expand our range.

<p>Bernadette ""Nadet"" Dolipas is a dear friend, classmate, colleague and family. Rather rudely and totally unexpected, she was told she had stage 4 cancer of the lungs early October 2013 (a few days ago). </p>
<p>Nadet is a community leader and has a passion for helping other people in need. Her latest cause is helping Cordillera achieve food security and people empowerment through the collective promotion and development of sustainable agriculture. </p>
<p>As her friends and family, we would like to help her in turn. We are aiming to raise funds towards the cost of her cancer treatments including chemotherapy, medicines and others. The doctors estimate that the total cost of treatment would be PHP 600,000. This would pay for the hospital costs, doctors' professional fees and medicines.</p>
<p>It would also be helpful to get the word out about this campaign. Please share this link in your facebook, twitter, email groups, friends. There are share tools in this fund raising site that you can also use.</p>

She is a community organizer of the Montanosa Research and Development Center (MRDC) serving the oppressed and poor people in the interior communities of the Cordillera. Recently, her doctors diagnosed her with stage 4 lung cancer. For many who ask if she is a smoker kaya siya nagkacancer, the answer is NO; she does not smoke, most probably, she got the illness from second hand smoke or due to her genetic predisposition.

Nadet is a community leader and has a passion for helping other people in need. Her latest cause is helping Cordillera achieve food security and people empowerment through the collective promotion and development of sustainable agriculture. 
As her friends and family, we would like to help her in turn. We are aiming to raise funds towards the cost of her cancer treatments including chemotherapy, medicines and others. The doctors estimate that the total cost of treatment would be PHP 600,000. This would pay for the hospital costs, doctors' professional fees and medicines.
It would also be helpful to get the word out about this campaign. Please share this link in your facebook, twitter, email groups, friends. There are share tools in this fund raising site that you can also use.
Thank you everyone. 
==

By the way, friends of Nadet (from Anido, San Jose, SLU Med School, and work) who are based here have been meeting recently. Napagkaisahan to hold a series of activities din. First of which will be a dinner on October 26, 5-9 PM to be spearheaded by her San Jose batchmates. Whoever is in Baguio then, see you at the City High Auditorium.

More on Nadet:
  * She was one of the founders/organizers of the UP Anido, a regional organization for Cordilleran students based in UP Diliman.
  * She was a Psychology student, stayed in Kalayaan Dorm batch 91. She was active in UP politics and she was affiliated with both ISA and SAMASA.

(Reposting from Imelda Tabiando) Bernadette Dolipas-Capuyan is a down to earth and passionate person. She is a community organizer of the Montanosa Research and Development Center (MRDC) serving the oppressed and poor people in the interior communities of the Cordillera. Recently, her doctors diagnosed her with stage 4 lung cancer. For many who ask if she is a smoker kaya siya nagkacancer, the answer is NO; she does not smoke, most probably, she got the illness from second hand smoke or due to her genetic predisposition. Let us support her in her fight against cancer. Help us raise funds for her chemotherapy, other medical expenses and needs. Friends, her family and we are sponsoring a ""DINNER FOR NADET"" on October 26, 2013 at the Baguio City National High School Auditorium from 5pm to 9pm. Tickets are from Php300.00-Php 1,000.00.

year fitness professional and the owner of New York Personal Training. In
short, I have dedicated my life to creating superior fitness and nutrition
programs as a means to improve the quality of life for anyone who is willing to
learn. Recently, as the result of an Achilles tendon injury, I was forced to
give up my passion – competing as an amateur triathlete. Inactivity being an impossibility,
I hit the books determined to create a challenging training program that was productive
for me (a 45 year old who still believes his best years lie ahead) as well as
anyone else who chooses to reward their gift of life with 100% commitment to
living it. In the end I created a system so powerful and revolutionary that its
initial success inspired me to create a virtual training studio (VTS) that will
allow me to touch lives of people from all walks of life, all over the world. </p>
<p>In addition to making physical
fitness available to virtually anyone with an internet connection or mobile

<p>The World Health Organization reports
that:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Worldwide obesity has nearly doubled
since 1980.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>In 2008, more than 1.4 billion adults,
20 and older, were overweight. Of these over 200 million men and nearly 300
million women were obese.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>35% of adults aged 20 and over were
overweight in 2008, and 11% were obese.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>65% of the world's population live in
countries where overweight and obesity kills more people than underweight.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>More than 40 million children under
the age of five were overweight in 2011.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Obesity is preventable.</p>
<p>The main obstacle isn’t gym equipment. It isn’t willingness to
exercise and eat right. It isn’t even socio-economic. The biggest hurdle to overcome
for most of the world’s citizens is a lack of access to reliable information. As  with almost everything, education is the great liberator. In the words of one
of my heroes, Anthony Robbins, “If you want to be successful, find someone who
has achieved the results you want and copy what they do and you'll achieve the
same results.” The VTS affords us the opportunity to be the model that millions
of people may copy. It allows us to fulfill our privilege, opportunity, and
responsibility to change lives with our gift. Your contribution will help us
help countless people, not just today, but for years to come.</p>
<p><b>How will your funds be used?  </b>Why do we need
$500,000? </p>
<p>The VTS must recreate the client experience
of our brick &amp; mortar studio. This begins with the intake of information.
Programs must be written that give value to participant’s answers, tag them
within a specific category, and then assign them the proper training and
nutrition program. The nutrition program must be segmented for different
regions and food customs. For each trainer in the VTS we must create a text and
video documentation of every exercise in their 16 week program. The program
then needs to be segmented into 48 “Workouts of the Day,” or “WOD’s.”
Additionally, a CRM (customer relationship management) program must be created
to stay in constant contact with each person who visits the VTS. The CRM
interfaces with the Social Media management team, who creates local, regional,
national, and international communities in which participants can engage each
other, ask and answer questions, share experiences, and celebrate their
success. Finally, or actually initially, we must get the word out – create campaigns
and affiliations that let the world know we exist.</p>
<p>The project will initiate immediately,
making use of funds as they are raised. Any costs exceeding the amount raised
in this campaign will be funded privately. As with any worthwhile campaign,
participation should be rewarded. In the spirit of our initiative we want you
to reap all of the benefits of great health and fitness. Donations will be
rewarded with VTS passes ranging from 1 month to lifetime.  Imagine – you get to help people all over the
world AND gain access to the best trainers in the world. It’s the ultimate Win-Win!</p>

<h2>Mom's Heartbreaking Battle with Cancer</h2>
<p>The “World's Best Mom” is facing the fight of her life.  Our mom, Cheryl Swanson, has always given the best of herself to everyone.  But now, at the sweet age of 66, her life has taken a turn for the worst. </p>
<p>Just a couple months ago, Mom had respiratory problems, which her family doctor had diagnosed as pneumonia.  She was given antibiotics, but she did not improve.  When she returned to the doctor he ordered an x-ray, followed by a CT scan.  He found a couple suspicious areas on her lung and her liver.  He referred her to a lung specialist, who then referred her to an oncologist.  The oncologist performed a biopsy on her liver, which confirmed the heartbreaking news that our mom had stage IV small cell lung cancer (the most aggressive type).  This included a large tumor in her right lung, two smaller ones in her left lung, numerous tumors throughout her liver, and had also spread to her lymph nodes and adrenal glands. </p>
<p>The oncologist informed her that without chemotherapy she would only have three days to three weeks to live.  Overwhelmed by the fear of not seeing her children again, she believed that chemo would be her only chance.  Within the hour she received her first chemo treatment.  After four days of extreme pain and sickness, our father rushed her to the hospital where she stayed in ICU for almost a week.  Her oncologist informed us that there was really nothing else they could do and sent her home to die.  But we were NOT giving up …</p>
<p>As soon as we learned of our Mom’s diagnosis, my sister and brother rushed to Arizona from Michigan and I flew out from Hawaii.  Mom looked like she only had <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">hours</span> left to live; pale white, could barely breathe or move, and so very thin!  She regained her spirit knowing that we were all here.  I came here on a mission and with a plan to use natural alternative cancer treatments to save our Mom’s life. </p>
<p>We brought Mom home from ICU and immediately began in-home cancer treatments.  She felt so much better being at home with us.  We wanted to get Mom into the <a href=""http://www.gerson.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Gerson Clinic"">Gerson Clinic</a> in Mexico, but could not afford the $16,000 cost for the three-week treatment.  Instead, we decided to try to implement the <a href=""http://gerson.org/gerpress/the-gerson-therapy/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""gerson therapy"">Gerson therapy</a> at home.  It has been difficult to follow the Gerson therapy as completely as is done in the clinic. Our daily treatment regimine consists of as many fresh carrot juices as we can get her to drink, many coffee enemas, lots of organic raw foods, and daily intravenous injections of B-17 (laetrile).  Although Mom has improved somewhat, she still has a long tough road ahead. </p>
<p>It’s very difficult for us to ask for financial help.  We don't expect you to feel sorry for Mom or our family, but this has been a shock to us all and has left us in a very desperate situation.  Dad has quickly used up his small savings and is now facing possible bankruptcy.  He and Mom have been barely surviving on their small monthly checks.  Their financial situation has caused them great distress, and now this horrible reality we have been faced with is more than we can bear. </p>
<p>Feeling like a financial burden raises Mom's stress level, which negatively affects her healing, and has caused Dad much emotional distress.  Myself, my sister, and my brother were all struggling financially before we left our homes to come out here.  We have now been here about three weeks, dedicating ourselves fully to saving Mom's life.  This has completely drained our financial resources, leaving us no other options.  That's why we need your help. </p>
<p>Always giving of herself and deeply concerned of others, Mom feels guilty receiving help, no matter how desperate the situation.  She is trying to keep her positive spirit through all of this, even during her coffee enemas and carrot juices.  As soon as she is able, Mom hopes to be able to help others in desperate situations ... but now she needs your help.</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Zami Smart Stool is the result of years of research on ergonomics and is designed to improve posture and promote active sitting. Made from the highest quality European sourced materials, this patented, double-convex form is the first sensor-enabled stool that gives you real-time feedback on your posture. The stool communicates to the Zami mobile app and collects data providing intelligent feedback and insight into your posture and daily sitting habits. Unlike most ergonomic solutions, Zami provides a sense of luxury and simplicity and looks great in any home or work interior.</span></p>

<p>After an initial short setup to determine your weight and other vital metrics, pressure sensors in each of the four legs determine your weight distribution and accurately determine your posture. This information is transmitted via Bluetooth to the Zami mobile app, which gives you immediate feedback about how to correct your posture. </p>
<p>Utilizing the sensors, the mobile app also provides you information about your sitting, including:</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>The time spent sitting (active and passive)</li></ul>
<ul><li>Quality of sitting (posture) and exercises to improve your daily sitting habits</li></ul>
<ul><li>Behavior during sitting (restless sitting or fidgeting, potential pressure point issues, etc.)</li></ul>

<p><b>Together we can create work environments that are health conscious, socially responsible, and integrate modern design.</b></p>
<p>In modern society most people spend the majority of their day sitting behind a desk and computer-screen. Passive sitting for prolonged periods takes a toll on our health, leading to a vast array of health problems - including back pain. Work related losses from back pain are estimated to cost U.S. employers well over $100 billion each year (Phillips, Slosar, Youssef, &amp; Andersson, 2013).</p>
<p>Extensive research has also shown that sitting in regular office chairs - even ergonomically designed chairs – does not promote good posture. In contrast, the Zami design reduces the amount of (your body's) surface area that comes in contact with the stool – without a backrest or armrests – and enables your body to effortlessly give way to its center of gravity and optimal posture.</p>
<p><b>                    <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432080095/pqorelpqivdrtt9w1llv.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 407.103734439834px; height: 292px;""/></b><br/></p>
<p>As an employer, it is important to promote a healthy work environment. With Zami, companies can correct problems associated with poor posture and inactivity in the workplace, and thus improve morale and increase productivity. Since employees can share (and compare) real time feedback about their posture, the Zami Smart mobile app can not only be used to foster teamwork and establish organizational culture, but the information can be presented to one's physician or HR department to track and verify posture improvement. Offering employees the opportunity to be a part of something new, innovative, and most importantly that will improve their health, is also a great way to attract the best talent to your team.</p>
<p>The Zami Smart Stool is the world’s first smart stool – and now companies have the opportunity to be an active part of 'The Future of Sitting.' See our Corporate Partner Smart Bundle. </p>

                                        So... Why is Zami so good for my health?









""Zami is not just your regular stool. Use your Zami for especially, designed Zami exercises and stretches!""


















Why We Created the Zami Stools












What does the Zami stool actually do for my spine? Here are some scans from the Diers scans that were the result of someone sitting on a regular chair, compared to a Zami stool. The natural protectiveS-curve in the spine that we have when we stand is the same as when we sit n a Zami stool.



The Products
Zami Essential Stool - Promoting Good Posture

Wood
This truly organic design represents natural beauty at its finest. The wooden Zami is made of the highest quality natural pressed wood. Knowing that wood designs can be difficult to match your interior, we provide three options ready for you to select: beech, walnut and oak. 
               

Zami is the solution for sitting problems, arising from working long hours behind screens. Zami is essential for your health, improving your posture and strengthening core muscles. Medical research has proven that active sitting is key to digestion and lowering your cholesterol levels. The Zami stool and its patented form are all developed to support active sitting.
We will connect closer to shipping so you can let us know if you want the beech, oak or walnut. 
The Zami Essential Zami designs come in wood and aluminum. The design features a unique patented double convex form. 
 


Zami Smart – The Best Solution for Active Sitting



Zami Smart Stool is the result of years of research on ergonomics and is designed to improve posture and promote active sitting. Made from the highest quality European sourced materials, this patented, double-convex form is the first sensor-enabled stool that gives you real-time feedback on your posture. The stool communicates to the Zami mobile app and collects data providing intelligent feedback and insight into your posture and daily sitting habits. Unlike most ergonomic solutions, Zami provides a sense of luxury and simplicity and looks great in any home or work interior.






After an initial short setup to determine your weight and other vital metrics, pressure sensors in each of the four legs determine your weight distribution and accurately determine your posture. This information is transmitted via Bluetooth to the Zami mobile app, which gives you immediate feedback about how to correct your posture. 
Utilizing the sensors, the mobile app also provides you information about your sitting, including:

The time spent sitting (active and passive)
Quality of sitting (posture) and exercises to improve your daily sitting habits
Behavior during sitting (restless sitting or fidgeting, potential pressure point issues, etc.)
Calorie Expenditures
Details

Height: 52cm (20.5 inches) Length: 51cm (20inches)  Width: 38cm  (15 inches) Weight: 5.1 kg      

The Zami Smart Stool has coated black steel and oak wood legs, and a genuine European sourced leather cushion seat. There is also a foot rest so is a great height for anyone.The Zami App – Connected to Zami Smart
You will receive immediate feedback from the app if you are not sitting right, not taking appropriate breaks or are sitting too long. The app also comes with suggested exercises and general healthy lifestyle suggestions. The long-term goal is to integrate Zami Life products with various other health and fitness options to give a complete picture of your health and lifestyle, providing an integrated experience.
      


The Zami app will track your sitting history, allowing you to get an overview about your sitting. This information can be presented to your physician when you need to do a post-facto analysis or plan for sitting and posture improvement that can be monitored along the way.

The Team


Zami is a self-funded company from the  town of Arnhem, Netherlands. Orthopedic Surgeon Piete Van Loon and Designer Ruud-Jan Kokke  created the Zami as a solution to sitting related back pain prevalent in todays society.

Support us to further revolutionize sitting





Corporate Partners 
   

Together we can create work environments that are health conscious, socially responsible, and integrate modern design.
In modern society most people spend the majority of their day sitting behind a desk and computer-screen. Passive sitting for prolonged periods takes a toll on our health, leading to a vast array of health problems - including back pain. Work related losses from back pain are estimated to cost U.S. employers well over $100 billion each year (Phillips, Slosar, Youssef, & Andersson, 2013).
Extensive research has also shown that sitting in regular office chairs - even ergonomically designed chairs – does not promote good posture. In contrast, the Zami design reduces the amount of (your body's) surface area that comes in contact with the stool – without a backrest or armrests – and enables your body to effortlessly give way to its center of gravity and optimal posture.
                    
As an employer, it is important to promote a healthy work environment. With Zami, companies can correct problems associated with poor posture and inactivity in the workplace, and thus improve morale and increase productivity. Since employees can share (and compare) real time feedback about their posture, the Zami Smart mobile app can not only be used to foster teamwork and establish organizational culture, but the information can be presented to one's physician or HR department to track and verify posture improvement. Offering employees the opportunity to be a part of something new, innovative, and most importantly that will improve their health, is also a great way to attract the best talent to your team.
The Zami Smart Stool is the world’s first smart stool – and now companies have the opportunity to be an active part of 'The Future of Sitting.' See our Corporate Partner Smart Bundle.

Health Benefits of Zami
The health benefits of sitting on a Zami design stool vs. a regular chair include:



  Enhances posture immediately upon sitting


  Trains muscles to maintain proper posture


  Decreases back pain and injury risk


  Encourages circulation, minimizing edema and varicose veins


  Increases ability to breathe


  Strengthens pelvic floor function 


  Lessens physical and mental stress



The Science behind Zami
The science behind Zami's health benefits comes from the chair’s patented double convex design and narrow sitting surface, which:



Immediately aligns pelvis in neutral position to facilitate natural curves of spine

Requires proper kinetic muscle chain firing and neuromuscular feedback to        maintain posture
Demands 360 degrees of integrated core muscle activation for stabilization 

Promotes “active” sitting and movement of legs around wide, open base for    enhanced circulation and decreased lower-body lethargy


Positions diaphragm’s attachment to lumbar spine and ribcage for optimal  respiratory and postural function 


Sets pelvis symmetrically, aligning the diaphragm and pelvic floor for  synchronous function

Restores neuromuscular efficiency of proper skeletal alignment to eliminate   compensatory muscular tension; initiates functional diaphragmatic breathing to mitigate the stress response, lowering heart rate, blood pressure and cortisol  (stress hormone) production

<div>The AguaClara technology was first created at <b><a href=""http://aguaclara.cee.cornell.edu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cornell University</a></b>, and we've had a lot of success over the past 10 years working with Honduran communities to build and improve systems ever since. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">However, all too often our work was hampered by uncertainty, never quite knowing where funding for the next project would come from. </span>

Now we want to spread the word, with a clear-cut plan that demonstrates what we have to offer, how we offer it, and why it's worth investing in as we make our journey to India.</div>

<p>That's not a typo: ""flocs"" are what form at an early stage of the treatment process, as water passes through the flocculator. It's when particles in the water collide into each other and get gradually bigger and heavier, to the point where they're heavy enough to settle on the bottom of the tank while the water continues to flow by. Basically, if flocs don't form, then you know the process isn't working. That's why we want you to join our floc!</p>

Our Partners

     
    




From Lab to Field






The AguaClara technology was first created at Cornell University, and we've had a lot of success over the past 10 years working with Honduran communities to build and improve systems ever since. However, all too often our work was hampered by uncertainty, never quite knowing where funding for the next project would come from. 



That's why we created AguaClara LLC. We needed a way to bridge the gap between R&D in the lab and implementation on the ground. We believe we've designed a technology that can revolutionize the water sector, and it's been tested and proven in communities throughout Honduras. Now we want to spread the word, with a clear-cut plan that demonstrates what we have to offer, how we offer it, and why it's worth investing in as we make our journey to India.


Past <=> Future




The Honduran countryside

 When the AguaClara student program at Cornell was first put together, there weren't many--besides us--who believed our vision was possible. Water treatment systems designed for communities all over the world...""But what happens when the parts break down? Who will operate and maintain it? And how can you reliably provide safe water when there isn't even reliable access to electricity?"" These were the questions that filled our minds.
We understood the challenge. We knew what the constraints were, and we believed in a human-centered design process that didn't just happen in the lab, but out in the field with the people, our end users. They taught us that a complex, high tech solution was doomed to fail. After all, what use is technology without electricity?  

To build the infrastructure of the future, we had to look to the past. We had to think about technology before electricity.
The Force of Gravity
When you think about renewable energy, what comes to mind? Solar, wind, biomass, hydroelectricity? How about...gravity?



In Honduras, where the AguaClara technology was first tested, the rain falls heavily across vast, mountainous regions. The evidence of water's intention to flow downwards is everywhere. It moves of its own accord as long as there's just the slightest of slopes, and by designing our technology to take advantage of that natural force, we were able to create something that works entirely without electricity.

An AguaClara plant in Tamara, Honduras



That's why you can say we're taking the technology of the past and adapting it for the future. In this way, we're designing something that actually works for the developing world, due to its simplicity and self-powering mechanisms. 

(We're just covering the basics here. If you're interested in the more technical details behind our systems, click here.)

The entire plant can be managed by one operator at a time. Unlike your average modern treatment plant, you don't need a secondary degree to figure out how to run it. Thus, the operators can and should be selected from members of the community being served. That's job creation + community ownership!



 


Left: Technician Antonio Elvir (left) and AguaClara engineer Drew Hart calibrating the chemical dose controller. Right: Many of the engineers who go through the AguaClara program are women. We work to encourage that culture of inclusion everywhere we go.


We want the community to understand and appreciate the importance of clean water and what it is we're offering long before we ever break ground in their town.


Simplicity also means using all locally-available materials. There's no room for specially fabricated components in these plants: they break far too easily and are too difficult for the community to fix or replace. The suppliers for every aspect of an AguaClara plant are based in the country where it's built. In other words: we support local.

Basically, we tried to think of everything. 

But new challenges are always on the horizon.

Shooting for the StaRS

That's why we need your support!

AguaClara LLC's focus is now in India, where some 104 million people lack access to clean water and an estimated 1,600 people die from diarrhea everyday (WPP Annual Report 2012). 

We're continuing to adapt our gravity-powered treatment systems in new contexts, for example in multi-village schemes and where the source of water is underground. We've been piloting our StaRS (Stacked Rapid Sand) filters in two villages in the state of Jharkhand, but we need additional funding to expand our capacity on the ground in order to really create something viable.

We also plan on establishing an office in India: a space where our engineering team can collaborate on design work and hold meetings with our potential partners. For the past year, we've been sharing very limited office space with our local implementation partner. It's about time we set up our own facilities, to increase our productivity as we seek to take the StaRS filters to scale. 


Here's the breakdown of how we plan on using the $200,000 over the course of the next year:


Establishing an in-country office in India ($20K)
Hiring 2-3 new AguaClara engineers ($60K-$100K)
Finishing the pilot StaRS filters in Jharkhand ($20K)
Leasing or purchasing a vehicle to make on-site visits ($5K)
Developing a curriculum for training AguaClara engineers and technicians in India ($25K)
Finalizing the move of AguaClara HQ to the San Francisco Bay Area ($2.5K)
Supporting ongoing research and development in Honduras ($30K)

""We Floc Together""

We've done our best to provide you with some unique perks of the highest quality, ones that communicate our values and demonstrate our appreciation for your support. That means offering clothing that is well-made and ethically manufactured, as well as water products that both reduce waste and improve quality. It also means showing love for the community that comes together here on social media and on our website. Finally, it means offering you the chance to create a legacy that not only supports the mission of universal access to safe water on tap, but a more inclusive world for everyone.

Note: After you claim a perk, you will soon be contacted by a member of our team who will gather your information based on what you selected.



$25 Perk (and everything above): A Special Thank You On Our Website

Crowdfunding campaigns are all about community, and we have nothing but a deep appreciation for the community that supports us. We want to honor you by creating a special, permanent page on our website that acknowledges everyone who contributed $25 or more to our important work in India. (If you are contributing on behalf of someone else, please let us know her or his name.)

$50 Perk: Engraved 1.0L Water Bottle

Represent AguaClara and the mission of universal access to safe water on tap every time you take a swig of clean water. Bottles come in either smoked pearl or dark blue (pictured).








$50 Perk: Limited Edition ""We Floc Together"" T-shirt

That's not a typo: ""flocs"" are what form at an early stage of the treatment process, as water passes through the flocculator. It's when particles in the water collide into each other and get gradually bigger and heavier, to the point where they're heavy enough to settle on the bottom of the tank while the water continues to flow by. Basically, if flocs don't form, then you know the process isn't working. That's why we want you to join our floc!





$80 Perk: AutoCAD Open Source Pullover


It's an understated sweater that speaks for itself. 
(Although you'll probably still have to explain it to people.)

<h3 style=""margin: 15px 0 0;"">1. How do I use this?</h3>
It's simple, the Stanford Water Purification System is designed for use with outdoor spigots, standard sink faucets, or standard shower hookups. We are currently working on producing more types of adapters so that the Stanford Water Purification System can be used on all water connections.

<h3 style=""margin: 15px 0 0;"">2. How long can one filter last me?</h3>
To protect the R.O. membrane, the carbon block pre-filter should be replaced every 3 months or 100 gallons of treated water.

<h3 style=""margin: 15px 0 0;"">3. How much does one filter cost?</h3>
We sell 3-pack carbon filters along with the one included in the base units, last a year for $39. And the RO membrane need to be replaced once a year for $40.

<h3 style=""margin: 15px 0 0;"">4. How about other maintenance?</h3>
Your Stanford Water Purification System unit was designed to be virtually maintenance free. Simply follow these recommendations and your unit should last for years:
<ul>
<li>Clean your unit with a damp cloth and mild dish soap. Do not use abrasive cleaners.</li>
<li>To protect the R.O. membrane, the carbon block pre-filter should be replaced every 3 months or 100 gallons of treated water.</li>
<li>When not in use for extended periods, your unit should be disconnected, placed in a plastic bag, and stored in the refrigerator.</li>
</ul><h3 style=""margin: 15px 0 0;"">5. What is the size of the product?</h3>It is as compact as a 16oz water bottle.

<h3 style=""margin: 15px 0 0;"">6. Can I take this for traveling?</h3>
Yes, it can provide filtered water to you in hotels, camping, many places.

<h3 style=""margin: 15px 0 0;"">7. How is this different from other reverse osmosis systems?</h3> First, we have a unique hook up solution in that it connects to a garden hose faucet. This provides near universal compatibility. Second, we are working to make this very easy to use, so that it is better than alternatives such as bottled water. There is only one compact canister, there is no tank or tap to install, and you can put the whole system in a drawer when you are not using it.
The economy factor also sets this product apart. At $79 a year, your Stanford Water System can produce 400 Gallons of filtered water a year.

<h3 style=""margin: 15px 0 0;"">8. What is the ratio of waste water generated compared to treated water from the Stanford Water System unit? Does this waste water contain all the contaminants filtered out?<span style=""font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 1.45em; font-size: 15px;"">  </span>
</h3><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The system flushes away the filtered out contaminants in the waste water. You get about 1 gallon of purified water for every 2 to 2.5 gallons of waste water. This can vary by the amount of water pressure. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Our funds raised will help us minimize the amount of water needed to flush the contaminants from the system, and allow us to develop additional devices to help you collect the discharged water into your non-edible plants and other safe household uses.</span></p><h3 style=""margin: 15px 0 0;"">9. What are the benefits of the device getting certified?</h3>There are many water filtration products sold without certifications, however, by getting our device certified by the WQA (Water Quality Association) we are able to take advantage of Government grants to subsidize the cost for lower income areas, where this may be needed most.<p></p><h3>About David Schulhof:</h3><p><span>David Schulhof is a Silicon Valley entrepreneur with twenty plus years of experience building internet sales and marketing channels for various industries. He co-founded companies like Betty Mills, Dexxa, and Envisions. But now he focuses on solving a more important problem than he ever has before. He wants to make healthy water more accessible to everyone. Once his daughter was born, this became a much more urgent matter. After working with various industry experts, other fellow parents, and water system manufacturers, the Stanford Water System was born.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/426726/files/20140311130054-Screen_Shot_2014-03-11_at_1.00.15_PM.png?1394568054"" src="""" style=""width: 569.5392953929539px; height: 370px;""/></p><p></p>

The Stanford Water System is a compact and portable water purifying system using Reverse Osmosis technology. Reverse Osmosis is capable of removing contaminants that filter pitchers like BRITA can't, including lead, mercury, arsenic, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, coppers and many others (see our comparison table below and video below)

Connects in seconds to outdoor spigots and standard faucets for water purification (see our 30 seconds videos).

Disconnects in seconds for storage (see our 30 seconds videos below).
Quick Overview of the Stanford Water System
It's all started with a father who was looking for a easy and affordable way to filter water for his family at home, and help others at the same time. Looking at these above pictures, which glass of water would you drink? And which one would you let your child consume? It’s surprising for most of us to imagine that clean and safe water is an issue here in the United States. Is that really that bad? Seeing is believing, we ran two water contaminant tests comparing water filtered from Stanford Water System and water from other filtration methods including carbon pitcher and bottled water. HOW-TO VIDEOSMany people asked us how easy it is to use the Stanford Water System unit. The answer is, it’s super easy to connect and disconnect to both outdoor spigots and indoor faucets. Watch the following 30-second-videos and you will see:You can also connect your Stanford Water System unit to the outdoor spigots, which means clutter-free kitchen:WATER CONTAMINANT TESTS Seeing is believing, we ran some experiment comparing Stanford Water System and other water solutions including carbon pitcher and bottled water. In each experiment, we used the T.D.S Tester and a precipitator. 

T.D.S Measure to test the total dissolved solids in the water. The lower the number is, the cleaner the water is. In this test, Stanford Water T.D.S number was 18PPM while the Pitcher Water number is 241PPM.


Precipitator Test (or T.D.S Demonstration Device) to reveal the contaminants in the water. An electrical charge will be sent through the water. This charge creates the ions to be unstable; resulting in the oxidization of the dissolved solids, and the green, cloudy clumpy scum that is produced is the byproduct of that reaction. Water with higher contaminants will be more reactant and become darker.

Stanford Water System vs. Bottled WaterNote: We did this experiment in South Bay, California. The TDS number of the water before using the Stanford Water System is 27PPM.Stanford Water System vs. Carbon Pitcher Note: We did this experiment in Discovery Bay, California. The TDS number of the water before any filtration is 470PPM.See what other early funders sayAnd we are proud to get the support from the Health & Wellness community and these amazing parent bloggers...STILL NOT CONVINCED?

There is only one compact canister, there is no tank or tap to install, and you can put the whole system in a drawer when you are not using it.
The economy factor also sets this product apart. At $79 a year, your Stanford Water System can produce 400 Gallons of filtered water a year.

8. What is the ratio of waste water generated compared to treated water from the Stanford Water System unit? Does this waste water contain all the contaminants filtered out?  
The system flushes away the filtered out contaminants in the waste water. You get about 1 gallon of purified water for every 2 to 2.5 gallons of waste water. This can vary by the amount of water pressure. Our funds raised will help us minimize the amount of water needed to flush the contaminants from the system, and allow us to develop additional devices to help you collect the discharged water into your non-edible plants and other safe household uses.9. What are the benefits of the device getting certified?There are many water filtration products sold without certifications, however, by getting our device certified by the WQA (Water Quality Association) we are able to take advantage of Government grants to subsidize the cost for lower income areas, where this may be needed most.About David Schulhof:David Schulhof is a Silicon Valley entrepreneur with twenty plus years of experience building internet sales and marketing channels for various industries. He co-founded companies like Betty Mills, Dexxa, and Envisions. But now he focuses on solving a more important problem than he ever has before. He wants to make healthy water more accessible to everyone. Once his daughter was born, this became a much more urgent matter. After working with various industry experts, other fellow parents, and water system manufacturers, the Stanford Water System was born.

<h3>What is ASD-DR?</h3>
<p>My name is Dawn Marcotte and I have a daughter who was misdiagnosed with ADHD in Kindergarten. she was correctly diagnosed with Aspergers Syndrome in 2nd grade but only because of a chance conversation I had with another parent.</p>
<p>We didn't have any idea where to take our daughter for a diagnosis and treatment so we just got a referral from our family doctor. The specialst we were sent to did not specialize in Autism Spectrum Disorders and so did not diagnose our daughter correctly. </p>
<p>Unfortunately this problem is all too common. There is no national database available for parents to search to find doctors, therapists or clinics in their area that specialize in Autism. Some states have a partial database available, but it can be hard to find.</p>
<p>I want to change that by creating an online searchable databse of specialists. I want this database to include contact information, specialties and recommendations by families who have actually used that clinic, doctor or therapist. I am thnking of something similar to an Angie's List, but specific to Autism health providers.</p>
<p>This is a huge undertaking and I need help to make the website a reality.</p>
<h3><strong>What Do I Need From You?</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>I need 3 things right now:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Donations</strong> - See the list below of specifics</p>
<p>2. <strong>Help getting recommendations</strong>. I can only recommend the doctors and therapists we have used for our family. I need lots of people to send me their recommendations. Here is a link to a form where people can submit their recommendations. <a href=""http://eepurl.com/AVoY1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://eepurl.com/AVoY1</a></p>
<p>3.<strong> Spread the word.</strong> If you can't donate I understand. I know how finanically draining raising a child on the spectrum can be, however you can share this project with others who may benefit from the website. </p>
<p>My goal is $2000 so that I can:</p>
<p>Pay a programmer to create the website - $540</p>
<p>Puchase the domain name - $15</p>
<p>Pay for WebHosting for the first year - $800</p>
<p>Pay to crowd source gathering specific information - $460</p>
<p>Pay a graphic artist to create a logo - $100</p>
<p>The items are listed in order of importance. If I don't get all of the money I can still launch, it will just take longer for me to gather the information myself. </p>
<p>If I happen to raise more money I will use it to purchase needed items for our local school - they have a fabulous program and I want to ensure it continues. </p>
<p>This website is so important for families with kids on the Autism Spectrum. It will save them time and effort - 2 things these families don't have a lot of. The website will also have lists of web resources for families. Often parents feel isolated and alone - we are not alone, but having other adults who understand the difficulties is essential to staying sane.  I want to create a database that lists support groups and social media sites. </p>
<p>I also plan to provide links to resources recommended by parents and families.</p>
<p>This is a website that has been needed for a long time.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As a contributor to this site you will help ensure that these kids get the help they need sooner. Studies have proven that Autism can be treated and early intervention is key. Delaying a correct diagnosis may mean no access to services. A delay of even a year can make a huge difference in the life of these children and their families. </p>
<p>We are one of the lucky families. We happen to live in a city with some of the best Autism specialists in the country. While our daughter was not diagnosed correctly until she was in 2nd grade she was recieving services through the school in Kindergartend and firts grade. The autism program in our school is fantastic (Thank You Miss Courtney) and our daughter learned a lot. However we were not able to get her into additional therapies until we had that medical diagnosis.</p>
<p>Once we did we added some additional social skills, behavioral therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy and sensory integration therapy to her schedule. She has blossomed into a smart, funny, loving 14 year old who is looking forward to a career as a fiction writer. </p>
<p>This is my first campaign to raise funds as I have self funded my other website, <a href=""http://www.thingstodowithkidsmn.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.thingstodowithkidsmn.com</a></p>

Nursing homes account for 18% of all Bed Bug infestations!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Bed Bugs love to live, breed, and feed in multi-unit dwellings - this is why elderly care facilities have been hit so hard. Odds are you know someone that has been or will be affected by the growing bed bug epidemic in Senior Care Facilities.</span> </p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong>Our Mission:</strong>  To use our technology - Smart Hound™ - to preserve the wellbeing of senior citizens by continuous, precision inspection for bed bugs and other pests harmful to human health BEFORE they become a problem for your friends - your family - yourself.  Early detection is key to quick and successful elimination.</span> </p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Little has been done to curb the rise of Bed Bugs due to embarrassment, lack of knowledge, and apathy. Our dedicated and professional team needs YOUR help to <strong>FIGHT FOR OUR SENIOR CITIZENS!</strong></span> </p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong>Our Plan:</strong>  With your help, we will begin the process of eliminating bed bugs from Senior Living and Senior Care Facilities. In the greater Raleigh-Durham (Triangle Region), North Carolina area alone, we have identified 127 facilities that would benefit from our services. With a successfull Indiegogo campaign, we will work with 20 of these facilities and begin FREE scanning twice each over a two month period. Our staff will personally travel to these facilities and work with their employees and residents to determine if and where bed bugs are present. Depending on the wishes of the individual facilities, we can accomplish this openly or discretely (without the public or residents aware of our presence). <strong>We believe that this free service for that time period will put in motion a future model for helping Senior Care Facilities across the nation.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">As stretch goals (see below), we will increase the number of facilites serviced and we will provide free units to a specific county health department in New Jersey that has shown great interest in becoming our beta tester for <span>Smart Hound</span><sup>TM</sup>. (Name withheld for privacy.) </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Your contributions will enable us to create more <span>Smart Hound</span><sup>TM </sup>units, rear and train enough <span>Sensor Bugs™ </span>to populate each unit, travel to at least 20 Senior Care Facilities around the greater Raleigh-Durham Triangle region, run tests for beg bugs, compile reports for each facility, and work to move <span>Smart Hound</span><sup>TM </sup>to the national stage so that everyone can benefit from bed bug elimination! </span></p>

<h1><em>THE PROBLEM - Bed Bugs are bad news. Really bad news.</em></h1>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">If you are reading this, then you have blood flowing through your veins and bed bugs want a drink. There is a good statistical chance that they will get the opportunity at some point. Bed bugs are equal opportunity feeders. They do not care if you are Democrat or Republican. They do not care if you are in the 1% or the 99%. They do not care if you are staying in the one-star or five-star hotels. They do not care what nationality, race, or religion you are. If you have blood, they want some. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Bed bugs can wait for a long time without feeding– months if needed – and hide in a variety of hard to reach places such as mattress seams, wall outlet boxes, headboards, movie theater seats, car seats, office carpet, suitcases, and so on.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">While we are having fun with this project, the impact of bed bugs on people is no laughing matter – especially those who are defenseless against these insects like the baby in the picture below and some of the elderly in retirement or care homes.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Determining if bed bugs are in your home requires extensive and expensive inspection either by humans or dogs, both of which must be trained professionals.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><em>Availability</em>: The most limiting factor of current inspection techniques is that they cannot be performed all the time.

<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong>If we find that consumers want the ability to monitor for bedbugs on a frequent basis and we roll out a consumer-ready version, <em>Smart Hound™</em> will be a fraction of the cost.

<h1><strong><em>SMART HOUND™ TO THE RESCUE – An Unexpected Solution</em></strong></h1>
<div>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">We are using Sensor Bugs™ - small, harmless, flying insects that are indigenous to the United States – to literally sniff out bedbugs – and much more! We have proven in the lab that Sensor Bugs™ can smell and respond to bed bugs, termites, fungus, explosives, drugs, and all kinds of chemical markers. In fact, in some tests they went head to head with trained dogs and beat them repeatedly.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Since Smart Hound™ can identify chemicals in the range of parts per billion, and in some cases parts per trillion, its detection ability is as good as or better than a dog giving the consumer the ability to detect as good as a dog – in the palm of your hand. And we put 5 Sensor Bugs™ in every cartridge which means it is like having 5 trained dogs in the palm of your hand. If one has a false positive or false negative, there are 4 more to back it up!</span></p>
</div>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/237/941/7acb7ac24284f65c6e2ae828f5fa47e8_large.jpg?1351716260"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong><em> </em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong><em>The Benefits</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">The electronic Smart Hound™ device that holds the Sensor Bugs™ is portable, easy to use and we believe will positively identify infestations before they get out of control. This can lower extermination costs and increase efficiency by focusing on the specific location where the bed bugs are located. By targeting the right location and only the right location, treatment will be faster and reduce the amount of pesticide used (a good thing for exterminators). It would also reduce the amount of residual pesticide in a home (a good thing for homeowners). We believe Smart Hound™ could have tremendous impact if widely used!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">1 - Give people peace of mind that they do not have bed bugs in their home / apartment / hotel room.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">2 – Help eliminate bedbugs from a wide area (e.g. an entire city) if many people were scanning for bed bugs at once.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">3 – Allow facility operators to ensure their multi-unit dwelling is bed bug free (this would also reduce lawsuits).</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">4 – Increase exterminator business because people are actively seeking out infestation on a routine basis.</span></p>

<img alt=""The Smart Hound™ program used to determine bed bug presence."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/255/849/bb82005ca7f2a132305eca0d9e25ef53_large.jpg?1352654335"" src="""" style=""""/><em>The Smart Hound™ program used to determine bed bug presence.</em>
</div>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong><em> </em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong><em>How It Works- Incredibly Simple, Incredibly Elegant Advanced Technology</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">The Sensor Bugs™ are trained in our lab (so they are pre-trained before you receive the cartridge) to associate food with the scent we want them to detect. We use a small plastic cartridge that contains 5 Sensor Bugs™. They gather around an air inlet in the cartridge when they detect the scent they are trained to. The Smart Hound™ device automatically detects this movement. The current prototype can be plugged into a USB port on any standard PC. The next generation version will have a built in microprocessor.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong>The two videos in the Gallery (see Gallery tab at the top of this page) show our Sensor Bugs™ in action!</strong> The first video shows the Sensor Bugs™ wandering around as bugs do. They are searching for food - notice how their search is fairly random. Air is continually flowing through an inlet hole in the middle of the cartridge - but the Sensor Bugs™ are not taking any notice.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">In the second video, the scent the Sensor Bugs™ are trained to is introduced into the air flow. See for yourself that as fast as 5 seconds it is very clear that the Sensor Bugs™ cluster around the air inlet. This movement is automatically detected by the Smart Hound™ technology that is holding the Sensor Bug™ cartridge.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong>And it's not just for bed bugs...</strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Given the device's unique ability to detect even the smallest chemical signatures, Smart Hound™ can be used for more than just household pests and bedbugs. In the future, our vision is for customers to order cartridges as needed to detect mold or mildew, air contaminants, toxic chemicals, or peanut contamination in food, or any number of other applications<strong>.  We are always open to customer suggestions regarding applications we have not considered!</strong></span></p>
<h1><em> </em></h1>
<h1><em>A FUTURE AFTER INDIEGoGo</em></h1>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Since the Sensor Bugs™ only live a couple of weeks and are good for a few days when they arrive ready for use, our vision is that the future Smart Hound™ offering will be an online ordering service that will allow our customers easy access for the detection of bed bugs and new cartridges for other things like termites, mold, etc.  So a detection cartridge filled with pre-trained Sensor Bugs™ will only be a mouse click and overnight shipping away.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">This will be particularly useful for travelers who may want to pack a Smart Hound™ device for when you arrive at a hotel in say New York or San Francisco. You could simply get online and order a Sensor Bug™ cartridge to be delivered to the hotel where they are staying. The package would be waiting for you at the front desk when they arrive. You can scan your room and then rest easy knowing no bed bugs are in the room...or run far away from the bed bug-infested hotel if you find them! That is our future vision and we are starting with you! <strong>We need to know the public wants this technology available! And the only way we will know is if you pledge today!</strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong><em> </em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong><em>Cancer and Disease Detection</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;"">A growing body of medical research shows that dogs, African pouch rates, bees, and yes, Sensor Bugs™ can detect a myriad of diseases by smell - such as melanoma (skin cancer), tuberculosis, colorectal cancer, and others.  Our estimates show that for current laboratory diagnostic tests that cost around $10,000, the Smart Hound™ system could reduce that cost to less than $100. A lot of work remains to refine processes and run tests in a clinic setting, but we believe we are about to see the start of a diagnostic revolution through the use of Smart Hound™. Rest assured we are exploring this area carefully. A strong showing here on IndieGoGo will help accelerate our plans in the disease detection arena as well. </span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong>Q&amp;A</strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong>Q: </strong>How long do the insects live?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong>A: </strong>Sensor Bugs™ live for approximately 2 weeks. If we chill them down in a refrigerator, they can live much longer. That is why we plan to ship them chilled if needed.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong>Q: </strong>Are Sensor Bugs™ dangerous?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong>A: </strong>No. Sensor Bugs™ are harmless. Entomologist carry them into kindergarten classrooms and let them crawl all over the kids' arms to show off interesting insects.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong>Q: </strong>Do I have to touch the insects?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong>A: </strong>No. You would only touch a plastic cartridge that contains the insects. We are still deliberating on if the cartridges should be clear (so you can see the Sensor Bugs™) or closed in so the insects can not be seen.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong>Q: </strong>Is “Sensor Bug” their real name?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong>A: </strong>“Sensor Bug” is not their original name – they have a scientific Latin name that is difficult to pronounce – so we gave them a name. It was either “Earl” or “Sensor Bugs” so we went with Sensor Bugs™.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong>Q: </strong>Will we be able to get refill cartridges in the future?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong>A: </strong>We hope to offer the units to the consumer in the future. But that is dependent on if we get enough response from the public to justify starting a product line where we offer the Smart Hound™ technology directly to consumers. If we do offer them to the consumer in the future, we will ensure that units you receive as part of the experimental team will also work with future cartridges.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong>Q: </strong>What do we do after we have used the Sensor Bugs™?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong>A: </strong>You can set them free if they are still alive. They are indigenous to the United States. If they have died, you can discard them in the trash. In the future we hope to be able to recycle the cartridges.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong>Q: </strong>Where do you get your Sensor Bugs™?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><strong>A: </strong>Our team rears them. They are going extinct in the wild. In 10 years it is highly likely these insects will only exist in captivity.</span></p>

Bed Bugs in the Elderly Care Community: There is a 33% chance that any given senior citizen will enter a nursing home facility and a greater than 50% chance that he or she will live in some form of assisted or independent living facility. Nursing homes account for 18% of all Bed Bug infestations!
Bed Bugs love to live, breed, and feed in multi-unit dwellings - this is why elderly care facilities have been hit so hard. Odds are you know someone that has been or will be affected by the growing bed bug epidemic in Senior Care Facilities. 
Our Mission:  To use our technology - Smart Hound™ - to preserve the wellbeing of senior citizens by continuous, precision inspection for bed bugs and other pests harmful to human health BEFORE they become a problem for your friends - your family - yourself.  Early detection is key to quick and successful elimination. 
Little has been done to curb the rise of Bed Bugs due to embarrassment, lack of knowledge, and apathy. Our dedicated and professional team needs YOUR help to FIGHT FOR OUR SENIOR CITIZENS! 
Our Plan:  With your help, we will begin the process of eliminating bed bugs from Senior Living and Senior Care Facilities. In the greater Raleigh-Durham (Triangle Region), North Carolina area alone, we have identified 127 facilities that would benefit from our services. With a successfull Indiegogo campaign, we will work with 20 of these facilities and begin FREE scanning twice each over a two month period. Our staff will personally travel to these facilities and work with their employees and residents to determine if and where bed bugs are present. Depending on the wishes of the individual facilities, we can accomplish this openly or discretely (without the public or residents aware of our presence). We believe that this free service for that time period will put in motion a future model for helping Senior Care Facilities across the nation.
As stretch goals (see below), we will increase the number of facilites serviced and we will provide free units to a specific county health department in New Jersey that has shown great interest in becoming our beta tester for Smart HoundTM. (Name withheld for privacy.) 
Your contributions will enable us to create more Smart HoundTM units, rear and train enough Sensor Bugs™ to populate each unit, travel to at least 20 Senior Care Facilities around the greater Raleigh-Durham Triangle region, run tests for beg bugs, compile reports for each facility, and work to move Smart HoundTM to the national stage so that everyone can benefit from bed bug elimination! 
Join the Smart HoundTM movement in putting an end to the uncertainty and difficulty in detecting bed bugs in Senior Care Facilities – a need is out there… and you can help provide the solution:

“…given the difficulties of recognizing the problem and of detecting bed bugs, I hope that city agencies will become more proactive — especially when it comes to housing for senior citizens…They need to know that they may not feel any bed bug bites or see any bed bugs…First, many people with bed bugs do not react to bed bug bites. Others will react but not see bed bugs. Fewer will react to bed bug bites, see bed bugs, and report them.”- Stephen Kells, University of Minnesota (Entomologist: Bed Bug researcher) See More »

SMART HOUND™ WILL SOLVE THE PROBLEM WITH YOUR HELP!
 
INTRODUCTION 
Smart Hound™ is a biology-based technology capable of detecting a large number of chemical agents in an effort to preserve human health. For this project, we are focusing on detecting bed bugs (specifically in elderly care facilities) and future goals of detecting breast cancer. Keep scrolling down to read about the future of DISEASE AND CANCER  DETECTION as well as our stretch goals. And don't forget the perks! Pics of our PERKS ARE AT THE VERY BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE.

 
THE PROBLEM - Bed Bugs are bad news. Really bad news.
If you are reading this, then you have blood flowing through your veins and bed bugs want a drink. There is a good statistical chance that they will get the opportunity at some point. Bed bugs are equal opportunity feeders. They do not care if you are Democrat or Republican. They do not care if you are in the 1% or the 99%. They do not care if you are staying in the one-star or five-star hotels. They do not care what nationality, race, or religion you are. If you have blood, they want some. 
Bed bugs can wait for a long time without feeding– months if needed – and hide in a variety of hard to reach places such as mattress seams, wall outlet boxes, headboards, movie theater seats, car seats, office carpet, suitcases, and so on.  
While we are having fun with this project, the impact of bed bugs on people is no laughing matter – especially those who are defenseless against these insects like the baby in the picture below and some of the elderly in retirement or care homes.

 
 
Current Methods for Bed bug Detection are Limited and Expensive
Determining if bed bugs are in your home requires extensive and expensive inspection either by humans or dogs, both of which must be trained professionals.
Availability: The most limiting factor of current inspection techniques is that they cannot be performed all the time. It is not practical for you to have a trained exterminator inspect your hotel room prior to every hotel visit, or inspect your apartment every week in case bedbugs have crawled through the walls or down the hall from a neighbor. Smart Hound™ has the potential to allow you, elderly care facilitiy staff, hotel staff, or apartment superintendents to scan frequently – even daily!
If we find that consumers want the ability to monitor for bedbugs on a frequent basis and we roll out a consumer-ready version, Smart Hound™ will be a fraction of the cost. BUT WE NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU THAT CONSUMERS WANT OUR SOLUTION…which is described in the next section.

 
SMART HOUND™ TO THE RESCUE – An Unexpected Solution

We are using Sensor Bugs™ - small, harmless, flying insects that are indigenous to the United States – to literally sniff out bedbugs – and much more! We have proven in the lab that Sensor Bugs™ can smell and respond to bed bugs, termites, fungus, explosives, drugs, and all kinds of chemical markers. In fact, in some tests they went head to head with trained dogs and beat them repeatedly.
Since Smart Hound™ can identify chemicals in the range of parts per billion, and in some cases parts per trillion, its detection ability is as good as or better than a dog giving the consumer the ability to detect as good as a dog – in the palm of your hand. And we put 5 Sensor Bugs™ in every cartridge which means it is like having 5 trained dogs in the palm of your hand. If one has a false positive or false negative, there are 4 more to back it up!


 
The Benefits
The electronic Smart Hound™ device that holds the Sensor Bugs™ is portable, easy to use and we believe will positively identify infestations before they get out of control. This can lower extermination costs and increase efficiency by focusing on the specific location where the bed bugs are located. By targeting the right location and only the right location, treatment will be faster and reduce the amount of pesticide used (a good thing for exterminators). It would also reduce the amount of residual pesticide in a home (a good thing for homeowners). We believe Smart Hound™ could have tremendous impact if widely used!
1 - Give people peace of mind that they do not have bed bugs in their home / apartment / hotel room.
2 – Help eliminate bedbugs from a wide area (e.g. an entire city) if many people were scanning for bed bugs at once.
3 – Allow facility operators to ensure their multi-unit dwelling is bed bug free (this would also reduce lawsuits).
4 – Increase exterminator business because people are actively seeking out infestation on a routine basis.

The Smart Hound™ program used to determine bed bug presence.

 
How It Works- Incredibly Simple, Incredibly Elegant Advanced Technology
The Sensor Bugs™ are trained in our lab (so they are pre-trained before you receive the cartridge) to associate food with the scent we want them to detect. We use a small plastic cartridge that contains 5 Sensor Bugs™. They gather around an air inlet in the cartridge when they detect the scent they are trained to. The Smart Hound™ device automatically detects this movement. The current prototype can be plugged into a USB port on any standard PC. The next generation version will have a built in microprocessor.
The two videos in the Gallery (see Gallery tab at the top of this page) show our Sensor Bugs™ in action! The first video shows the Sensor Bugs™ wandering around as bugs do. They are searching for food - notice how their search is fairly random. Air is continually flowing through an inlet hole in the middle of the cartridge - but the Sensor Bugs™ are not taking any notice.
In the second video, the scent the Sensor Bugs™ are trained to is introduced into the air flow. See for yourself that as fast as 5 seconds it is very clear that the Sensor Bugs™ cluster around the air inlet. This movement is automatically detected by the Smart Hound™ technology that is holding the Sensor Bug™ cartridge.
 
And it's not just for bed bugs...
Given the device's unique ability to detect even the smallest chemical signatures, Smart Hound™ can be used for more than just household pests and bedbugs. In the future, our vision is for customers to order cartridges as needed to detect mold or mildew, air contaminants, toxic chemicals, or peanut contamination in food, or any number of other applications.  We are always open to customer suggestions regarding applications we have not considered!
 
A FUTURE AFTER INDIEGoGo
Since the Sensor Bugs™ only live a couple of weeks and are good for a few days when they arrive ready for use, our vision is that the future Smart Hound™ offering will be an online ordering service that will allow our customers easy access for the detection of bed bugs and new cartridges for other things like termites, mold, etc.  So a detection cartridge filled with pre-trained Sensor Bugs™ will only be a mouse click and overnight shipping away.
This will be particularly useful for travelers who may want to pack a Smart Hound™ device for when you arrive at a hotel in say New York or San Francisco. You could simply get online and order a Sensor Bug™ cartridge to be delivered to the hotel where they are staying. The package would be waiting for you at the front desk when they arrive. You can scan your room and then rest easy knowing no bed bugs are in the room...or run far away from the bed bug-infested hotel if you find them! That is our future vision and we are starting with you! We need to know the public wants this technology available! And the only way we will know is if you pledge today!
 
Cancer and Disease Detection
A growing body of medical research shows that dogs, African pouch rates, bees, and yes, Sensor Bugs™ can detect a myriad of diseases by smell - such as melanoma (skin cancer), tuberculosis, colorectal cancer, and others.  Our estimates show that for current laboratory diagnostic tests that cost around $10,000, the Smart Hound™ system could reduce that cost to less than $100. A lot of work remains to refine processes and run tests in a clinic setting, but we believe we are about to see the start of a diagnostic revolution through the use of Smart Hound™. Rest assured we are exploring this area carefully. A strong showing here on IndieGoGo will help accelerate our plans in the disease detection arena as well. 
 
We Need YOUR Help!
We have approached the hotel chains and we have not received much interest. So we decided to ask consumers – the crowd – YOU! If you would like the ability to scan for bed bugs. The way to give us your “yes” is to pledge NOW! We need financial support to help take the prototype to the next level with new molds and microprocessor-based computing instead of a laptop. We also need some field testers - MEANING YOU!  If you pledge at the Research Assistant Level and above, we will provide you with all the tools you need to conduct research and report back to us. This includes a Smart Hound™ beta device and cartridges to test for bed bugs in a location of your choosing.  Whether you use it in your own home, apartment complex, a local nursing home, business, etc., the data you collect and report to us will help Laboratory Z bring the Smart Hound™ technology to the consumer market. NOTE – A REQUIREMENT TO BE PART OF THE RESEARCH TEAM AT THE RESEARCH ASSISTANT AND ABOVE LEVELS IS THAT YOU AGREE TO SEND US THE RESULTS OF YOUR TESTING WITH NO RESTRICTIONS ON USE. THIS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO MOVE THE PROJECT FORWARD AND WE SINCERELY APPRECIATE YOUR HELP!

 
STRETCH GOALS - SPREAD THE WORD!
Tweet, Post, Like us on Facebook,“LinkedIn Us” (we’re not sure how to say that last one as a verb!), email your friends – or go old school and call someone or talk about us over coffee!
As an additional reward for your zealotry in fighting the bed bug menace, we offer these stretch goals and rewards:
STRETCH GOAL 1: $150,000 – when we reach $150,000 all Research Assistant Level and above supporters get an additional bed bug sensing cartridge at no additional cost. In addition, we will increase our Free Senior Facility scanning to 25 facilities.
STRETCH GOAL 2: $250,000 - Insects for everyone! If you have pledged at Corporal Level or above, you will receive one free, gently used Sensor Bug™ (yes – it will have already passed on). In addition, we will increase our Free Senior Facility scanning to 35 facilities.
STRETCH GOAL 3: $400,000 – At this level, we will provide Smart Hound™ units to elderly care facilities to a previously indentified county in New Jersey that has shown great interest in searching for bed bugs. This will be at no cost to the facilities, the county, or the state. We will take care of all the costs and scanning. For the time being, we are withholding specifics of the county for privacy reasons.

Q&A
Q: How long do the insects live?
A: Sensor Bugs™ live for approximately 2 weeks. If we chill them down in a refrigerator, they can live much longer. That is why we plan to ship them chilled if needed.
Q: Are Sensor Bugs™ dangerous?
A: No. Sensor Bugs™ are harmless. Entomologist carry them into kindergarten classrooms and let them crawl all over the kids' arms to show off interesting insects.
Q: Do I have to touch the insects?
A: No. You would only touch a plastic cartridge that contains the insects. We are still deliberating on if the cartridges should be clear (so you can see the Sensor Bugs™) or closed in so the insects can not be seen.
Q: Is “Sensor Bug” their real name?
A: “Sensor Bug” is not their original name – they have a scientific Latin name that is difficult to pronounce – so we gave them a name. It was either “Earl” or “Sensor Bugs” so we went with Sensor Bugs™.
Q: Will we be able to get refill cartridges in the future?
A: We hope to offer the units to the consumer in the future. But that is dependent on if we get enough response from the public to justify starting a product line where we offer the Smart Hound™ technology directly to consumers. If we do offer them to the consumer in the future, we will ensure that units you receive as part of the experimental team will also work with future cartridges.
Q: What do we do after we have used the Sensor Bugs™?
A: You can set them free if they are still alive. They are indigenous to the United States. If they have died, you can discard them in the trash. In the future we hope to be able to recycle the cartridges.
Q: Where do you get your Sensor Bugs™?
A: Our team rears them. They are going extinct in the wild. In 10 years it is highly likely these insects will only exist in captivity.

<p>Welcome and thank you for visiting our fundraising campaign. We'd like to thank those who contributed and joined us for <em>Vinyasa in the Vineyard</em>, a fundraising event to support yoga classes for Veterans. The event was open to everyone in the community, held July 28, 2013 in Preston, Conn.</p>
<p>Participants enjoyed a morning practice with mats surrounded by rows of vines and breathtaking views of the Connecticut countryside, connecting with body, breath, mind and the community. The gentle 75- minute vinyasa yoga class was led by All Hearts Center instructors Carol Klammer, Christine Jablonski and Cheryl Hughes. Blackwolf Drumming was offered by Eagle Feather, a Native American and U.S. Veteran, accompanied by Singing Willow. </p>
<p>Those who wanted were able to balance their practice with a wine tasting after the vinyasa, led by the experts of Preston Ridge Vineyard immediately following the class. Participants were encouraged to enjoy additional live music, provided by Preston Ridge Vineyard, as they casually visited with one another, immersed in the spirit of the day, the beauty of the countryside.</p>
<p>The first Community Vinyasa in the Vineyard for SECT!  We are excited to announce that combined donations through Indiegogo and the event raised funds of nearly $1400.00.  This will provide the opportunity to offer a fully paid scholarship for 10 veterans for a 10- week program of Mindful and Sensitive Yoga for Soldiers, 20 mats, DVDS and booklets.  Thank you everyone, your generosity will give others an opportunity to step forward.</p>
<p>Mindful and Sensitive Yoga- a new program as an outreach to our servicemen and women. Self- connect, options, visceral and concrete.  No sanskrit or assists.  This yoga provides the opportunity for others to learn self- coping skills.  Fight or flight- the sympathetic nervous system can take control over a person when sudden dramatic, negative and dangerous experiences occur. This approach to yoga allows the participant to self- connect to themselves, allowing the parasympathetic nervous system to re- enage.  For more information on Trauma, PTSD, visit <a href=""mailto:military@mentalhealthscreening.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">military@mentalhealthscreening.org</a> .</p>

<h2>Please help Michelle Mosier Nelson get to the Mayo Clinic. </h2>
<p>My sister-in-law, Michelle, was diagnosed with <a href=""http://hemiplegicmigraine.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">hemiplegic migraines</a> about 10 months ago.  Hemiplegic migraine is a rare, neurological disease that causes stroke like symptoms when attacks occur.  After several doctors and numerous failed treatments, Michelle has an appointment at the Mayo Clinic.  She has to be there for at least 7 business days. </p>
<p>Michelle is a wife and mother of six wonderful children. Those who know Michelle will tell you that she is an incredible mother.  She bakes bread every day for her family, cooks the most amazing meals, and does great activities with her kids.  About a year ago, all of this changed. </p>
<p>Michelle was taken to the emergency room, with symptoms of having a stroke.  She was diagnosed with Bell’s palsy, but the diagnosis was changed to hemiplegic migraines two months later.  Her headaches are debilitating.  On a good day, she is able to get out of bed. She recently went to the grocery store and was excited that she was able to make it half way through the store, without her wheelchair or cane, before her tremors started. </p>
<p>Michelle’s symptoms are getting worse, with the “attacks” becoming more frequent and lasting longer.  She has a headache every day.  Michelle’s face droops on the right all of the time, but is worse with an “attack.”  When she has an “attack”, her right side becomes paralyzed and she is unable to talk.  She and her children have developed their own sign language, so they can communicate during an attack.  Sometimes the “attack” affects both sides of her body.  My brother, Michelle’s husband, told me that during an attack, sometimes the only way she can answer yes or no questions is by slightly moving her hand one direction for “yes” and another direction for “no.”  That is all she is able to move. </p>
<p>Michelle’s trip to the Mayo Clinic is going to be expensive, with hotel, food, transportation, medical co-pays and other expenses.  I have estimated $3000 to be the minimum amount needed for Michelle’s visit at the Mayo Clinic, excluding medical co-pays and expenses. </p>
<p>Any assistance given to them will be greatly appreciated.  If you are not able to contribute financially, please pray for Michelle and her family.  Hopefully, Michelle will get the treatment she needs at the Mayo Clinic and she will once again be able to bake bread and play with her kids.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>I am Shelby's little sister, Shayna. My family and I live in Broomfield, CO. We live a normal, fun and carefree life for the most part. Recently, our world has been flipped upside down and we are in need of help. My family and I are creating this fund because my brother, 24, is currently struggling with germ cell cancer, a form of testicular cancer, for the third time. He has been struggling since he was 19 years old. He has undergone many surgeries and recently suffered a seizure which lead to the discovery of a cancerous brain tumor. After a successful brain surgery, the doctors have found that the cancer has returned to his lungs as well. He now needs high-dose chemotherapy treatment and a stem cell transplant to save his life. We recently found out he will have a total of two stem cell transplants and the treatment will last at least 5 months. Each chemotherapy treatment and transplant cycle will be three weeks, for a total of 6 weeks hospitalization. The doctor recommends outpatient care if possible for these three weeks which would require someone to care for Shelby 24/7 and visit the clinic every single day to check his counts. This treatment will be very difficult on his body and he has been forced to move back in with my mom because he will be unable to work. Due to his inconsistent income, piles of previous and current medical bills, and need for in-home care, Shelby will lose his home.Our family will struggle to earn enough money to pay for the in-home care, prescriptions, co-pays, rent, food and bare necessities that my brother will need. My single mother, brother's girlfriend, my husband and I, miss many days of work over the course of the treatment to care for my brother and get him to his numerous appointments. My brother is very optimistic and in order to maintain his spirits, my family and I need to provide him with the care he deserves and the basic comforts of life. If you are able, we are asking for any help that you can give to us. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are not just trying to pay Shelby's medical bills, this money will have a direct impact on how we are able to take care of him. If we do not receive help, it is very possible that my brother may not receive in-home care if he needs it. He may have to stay inpatient throughout the 3 week treatments. Shelby does not sleep well in the hospital and is not often allowed to be as active as he wants. He is an active boy and is basically miserable in a hospital.  The doctor told us that the more he is active and comfortable, the better he will do, but this will require someone taking more than six weeks off of work. For this to be possible we need your help. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Regardless of the amount of money we earn, ALL of it will go to Shelby's treatment expenses.  Our goal is to cover rent, food, and medical expenses during this treatment to ensure Shelby can be comfortable and receive the best care and love in the world at home.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please, please, Share this fund with everyone you know! Our goal is to provide the necessities for Shelby so that he does not have to think twice about anything but his survival. Shelby has been so strong and the love he has received from friends, family and strangers have helped him thus far, please help us if you can.</p>

<h3 style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Our Story:</h3>The picture we have provided above will be our ""Opt In"" box on the first page of our actual membership site. It allows people that may not be ready to join to receive a Free downloadable DVD that explains about Tai Chi and about how the website works.<br/><br/>My name is Kara and I'm working with Morris, and his cousin Mike to develop an online membership website that teaches <span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">self healing</span> <span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">through Tai Chi</span>.<br/><br/>Tai Chi began as a Martial Art roughly 300 years ago and at first was used as a means of self defense. Over time different students of the original founder began to develop various forms of the art depending on their personal interest based in different schools of philosophical thought. The most familiar school of thought is Taoism and it teaches people how you can create inner peace even while the world around you is in chaos. <br/><br/>Eventually Tai Chi became more widely known as a means of exercise for the body and mind. There are many different schools of Tai Chi but they all teach a mind body connection toward health and wellness. <br/><br/>Our Tai Chi Master has 30 years of experience and teaches a form of the art known as Yang Style Tai Chi which is the most popular and widely practiced form in the world today. <br/><br/>I have lived with severe chronic pain since I was 11 years old which means I have now dealt with chronic pain for 30 years. Most of my medical conditions were inherited and other pains are from injuries. A few of my conditions are endometrioses,interstitial cystitis, degenerative disc disease, osteoarthritis,chronic kidney stones and a herniated disc at L5/S1. <br/><br/>Morris, has also lived with chronic pain for over 30 years. He was in a motorcycle accident where his wrists, knees, arms and ankles were broken. His discs were compressed and his skull was fractured. On top of this accident years later he was injured at work while lifting a heavy object that caused his lumbar disc to herniate and later fully blow. <br/><br/>Mike, or as he's also known by 'Maui Mike', has been a student of Tai Chi for over 30 years and has been a Tai Chi Master for the last 5 years. After Mike and Morris reconnected at a family event Mike taught Morris and myself about the awesome health benefits of Tai Chi and it has changed our lives!<br/><br/>Because Morris and I have lived with the trials of chronic pain for decades<span style=""font-style: italic;""> <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">we know all too well</span></span><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""> </span>how constant pain interrupts a persons quality of life and how it can alienate a person leaving them feeling hopeless. This is why we have all decided to share our experience with Tai Chi and why we want other people to be able to have <span style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"">easy access</span> <span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">to Tai Chi lessons </span><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">and a supportive community.</span><br/><br/>The site will offer lessons of 15 to 20 minutes delivered weekly to each members mailbox so that every member will be able to download lessons at their own pace. The cost will be $20.00 per month for individuals and we'll offer group discounts. <br/><br/>The health benefits of Tai Chi are not just for people that suffer from pain and illness but it is also a great way to stay in excellent physical shape! We'll also be giving tips for staying clam at work, before an important meeting, for those that have a difficult time falling asleep and much more. <br/><br/>Tai Chi health benefits have been studied by many different hospitals and other various medical institutions. Notably, the Mayo clinic studied the health benefits of Tai Chi and they concluded that a regular routine of Tai Chi exercise can reduce inflammation, lower blood pressure, ease depression, reduce anxiety and much more. <br/><br/>We have also developed the Tai Chi site to help people like <span style=""font-style: italic;"">my mother</span> who was diagnosed last summer with <span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Early Onset Alzheimer's</span>.</span> My mother also suffers from chronic pain. We want to reach people like my mom who can greatly benefit from staying active and by eating a healthy well balanced diet. So, along with offering weekly downloadable Tai Chi lessons the site will also have a section that offers free nutritional information which helps to reduce and even abate cognitive decline as we age.<br/><br/>As soon as we are able we plan to donate funds for helping low incomes families pay for expenses in relation to things such as Adult Daycare or Home Care, Assisted Living and other expenses involved with taking care of a loved one with Cognitive disorders. <br/><span style=""font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;""></span><br/><p style=""font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"">The Impact:</p>
</div><div>The Weekly Tai Chi lessons will help people that suffer from physical illnesses, depression, anxiety and other ailments by teaching people that even just a few minutes a day can change the way they feel physically and mentally and that their overall health can greatly improve. By making Tai Chi easily accessible to a lot more people we hope the impact will be that there will be many more people that will be a lot more healthy. <br/><br/>Most <span style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"">people that are disabled</span> either with chronic pain, chronic illness, depression or precognitive decline disorders are limited by their ailments and are often unable to access transportation on a regular basis. By providing people with the ability to easily access Tai Chi lessons at home on their computers we will be able to reach a large group of people that would not otherwise be able to participate. We will put the Ability back into disability!<br/><br/>We feel confident that we will be able to help many people to get off the sofa and to start exercising which will improve the quality of their lives. Through a regular routine of Tai Chi pain can be lessened, self esteem and confidence can improve and inflammation can be reduced, blood pressure can be lowered, as well as many other health benefits.<br/><br/>Our site will also help<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> raise awareness for Alzheimer's and Chronic Pain </span>by working with established non profit organizations. <br/><p><br/></p>

<h3>Caring for Carol - A Grave for our Mother</h3>
<p>Carol Nordvik was a single mother raising three children for nearly twenty years, Jeffrey, Kelsey, and Katie. She loved her children so much, that she worked at the school her own kids went to, so she could watch them grow up.<br/><br/>In early 2007 Carol was diagnosed with lung cancer. Devistatingly, life was tough enough for a single parent raising three children, and now there was a mountain of medical bills on top of it. Carol was given 3-6 months to live.<br/><br/>Despite doctor's estimates, Carol fought to survive for her children. By early 2008, it had progressed to the point where she had to quit her job to persue more agressive treatments to survive. By the middle of the year, she was in bed everyday in agonizing pain from extensive chemotherapy treatments. <br/><br/>Surprisingly, the treatments and experimental drugs started working, and the cancer was slowly fading. By the end of the 2008 she was back on her feet, her hair was growing back, and she was counting her blessings. She even became engaged to a new man in her life. <br/><br/>Then, a terrible infection caught up with her, one that all the doctors had somehow missed. The infection attacked her weakened immune system, and made her so weak that the cancer was able to spring back to life, and completely take over her body within days. Carol immedietly went back into the hospital on December 1st. She passed away on December 7th, in the early morning hours with her family around her.<br/><br/>Her children, who were just out of high school themselves, lost her home, vehicle, and everything to pay off the debts and expenses left behind. When it was all said and done, there wasn't enough left to bury her.<br/><br/>She remains cremated in an urn, but her children have no place to visit, no place to pray to and speak to their mother. Her children have no grave to bring flowers to on her birthday.<br/><br/>After a long battle with the life insurance company, they paid out her life insurance policy to a feuding relative, who spent the money on a car instead of helping her children to bury their mother.<br/><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>While her three children struggle to survive on their own in apartments and low-end jobs, every attempt to raise money in efforts to bury her has stalled.</p>
<ul>
<li>Estimates show $1200 would cover all costs and expenses of the burial, grave site, and purchase of the gravestone.</li>
<li>Any leftover funds would be donated to Relay For Life, which our mother had walked in for several years in support of her friends and eventually herself.<br/><br/>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Carol's family extended out past just her three children. there are dozens of family members, cousins, and a fiancee who would love to have a place to share their memories and prayers with their mother.</p>
Our mother loved the outdoors, planting her own gardens yearly, and she deserves more than to be kept inside a vase. Please help us get our mother back outside with nature that she loved, and grant her children and family a place to visit her.<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Further Information About Carol</h3>
<p>Carol's Obituaries are not difficult to find. She was a resident of Grand Island, New York since her children were born.</p>
<p>An online Obituary can be found at <a href=""http://www.rhoneyfuneralhome.com/display.asp?ID=1086"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.rhoneyfuneralhome.com/display.asp?ID...</a></p>

Carol was given 3-6 months to live.Despite doctor's estimates, Carol fought to survive for her children. By early 2008, it had progressed to the point where she had to quit her job to persue more agressive treatments to survive. By the middle of the year, she was in bed everyday in agonizing pain from extensive chemotherapy treatments. Surprisingly, the treatments and experimental drugs started working, and the cancer was slowly fading. By the end of the 2008 she was back on her feet, her hair was growing back, and she was counting her blessings. She even became engaged to a new man in her life. Then, a terrible infection caught up with her, one that all the doctors had somehow missed. The infection attacked her weakened immune system, and made her so weak that the cancer was able to spring back to life, and completely take over her body within days. Carol immedietly went back into the hospital on December 1st. She passed away on December 7th, in the early morning hours with her family around her.Her children, who were just out of high school themselves, lost her home, vehicle, and everything to pay off the debts and expenses left behind. When it was all said and done, there wasn't enough left to bury her.She remains cremated in an urn, but her children have no place to visit, no place to pray to and speak to their mother. Her children have no grave to bring flowers to on her birthday.After a long battle with the life insurance company, they paid out her life insurance policy to a feuding relative, who spent the money on a car instead of helping her children to bury their mother.


What We Need
While her three children struggle to survive on their own in apartments and low-end jobs, every attempt to raise money in efforts to bury her has stalled.

Estimates show $1200 would cover all costs and expenses of the burial, grave site, and purchase of the gravestone.
Any leftover funds would be donated to Relay For Life, which our mother had walked in for several years in support of her friends and eventually herself.




The Impact
Carol's family extended out past just her three children. there are dozens of family members, cousins, and a fiancee who would love to have a place to share their memories and prayers with their mother.
Our mother loved the outdoors, planting her own gardens yearly, and she deserves more than to be kept inside a vase. Please help us get our mother back outside with nature that she loved, and grant her children and family a place to visit her.


Further Information About Carol
Carol's Obituaries are not difficult to find. She was a resident of Grand Island, New York since her children were born.

<p>This difficult-to-stop bleeding from minor cuts can be stubborn.  When it happens, it does not seem serious, but it sure is a <em>nuisance</em>!</p>
<p>Nuisance Bleeding causes people to stop doing the things they love.  People give up gardening, cooking, woodworking, fishing, working in the garage, playing sports, and the list goes on.</p>
<p>If Nuisance Bleeding has changed your lifestyle (or a loved one), please share your story with us by <a href=""https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1SwiDxDdlvQXibNe9d3-dQFs329WQTjXfWu8T6jXxwhU/viewform"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">taking our confidential survey</a>.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>Nuisance Bleeding should not stop people from doing their favorite activities, or even shaving.  With your help, we are going to change that!</em></strong></p>
<p>Nuisance Bleeding is ignored by the medical community.  People are not given the right tools or information they need to stop the bleeding more quickly and on their own. </p>
<p>We need to get AllaQuix™ into the hands of people that require a professional-grade wound dressing that can stop this stubborn bleeding, or Nuisance Bleeding, quickly.   There are many people that this fits as we discovered that:</p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>1 in 3 adults can have difficulty with getting a simple cut to stop bleeding.</em></strong></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.inspirationmedtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/One_In_Three-IGG-Image.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</ol><p align=""center""><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong><em>Nuisance Bleeding is not just a “nuisance,” it is a big deal.</em></strong></p>
<p>There are millions of people in the U.S. that are at risk of Nuisance Bleeding.  Why?  Some of these people are born with a genetic condition, such as a bleeding or clotting disorder.  Others are taking medication that puts them at risk.  One of every three adults in the U.S. are taking prescription blood thinners (such as Coumadin, Plavix, and Pradaxa) or taking daily aspirin for heart health.  These drugs work well at stopping clots in the body, but one of the side effects is that they do not allow the blood to clot at a cut in order to stop the bleeding.  Minor cuts can bleed and bleed and bleed.  <em>That is a nuisance – but this nuisance can become a serious medical problem. </em></p>
<p>Since this bleeding is hard to stop, tens of thousands of people go to the Emergency Room every year because of a simple cut!  That is a hassle.  <strong><em>Not only that, but this trip to the ER can cost more than $800.</em></strong> Several hours and $800 for the privilege? No Thanks.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.inspirationmedtech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ER_2-IGG-Image.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>That is not the worst of it. </strong> People are taking blood thinners or daily aspirin to protect their health, so it is important for them to keep taking their medication.  More than 10% of these people stop taking their blood thinner because of Nuisance Bleeding!  That can lead to disastrous consequences, including hospitalization, heart attack, stroke, and even death.  Suddenly the video about Bob and Jane is not quite so funny. </p>
<p><strong>A journal from Mayo Clinic</strong> tells the story of a man that got frustrated with Nuisance Bleeding when he nicked himself shaving.  He stopped taking his blood thinner.  He ended up in the hospital for the second time in a month to have another stent placed.  Nuisance Bleeding can have serious consequences, but most people don’t know about it or know how to handle it.  Your support will help people take charge of their health and live better. </p>

<p align=""center""><strong>More Information on AllaQuix™</strong></p>
<p><strong>AllaQuix™ is medical-grade gauze made from chitosan. </strong> This is not ordinary gauze, but it is an active hemostat, which means that it helps stop the bleeding from a cut, even when the body has a hard time doing it itself.  Ordinary gauze, tissues, or adhesive bandages just absorb blood and protect the wound. </p>
<p>Chitosan wound dressings have been used in hospitals and the military to stop bleeding fast, even in people that have trouble stopping bleeding.  Now we want to take this advanced technology directly to people who need it to stop Nuisance Bleeding.</p>

<p>According to the American Heart Association (AHA), there are more than 300,000 victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest each year in the U.S.  However, less than 8% of these victims survive.  Bystanders rarely volunteer to help, because their CPR skills are too often poor and they are afraid of hurting the victim.  According to the AHA, our beta test participants, and many others, CPR training has been ineffective due to the<strong> lack of realism of the CPR manikins</strong> used.  CPR manikins have not changed much since CPR was first introduced some 50 years ago.  Studies have also shown that health professionals and emergency personnel often perform CPR poorly for lack of adequate training and recall.</p>
<p>In addition to a lack of realism, today's CPR manikins are also inadequate because they fail to support the AHA's 2010 guidelines, which now focus on the <strong>quality of chest compressions</strong> as opposed to airway and breathing issues (more on this below).</p>

<p><strong>WHY THE NEW HCR CPR MANIKIN WILL BE SUPERIOR TO THOSE CURRENTLY IN THE MARKETPLACE</strong></p>
<p>HCR's patented ""human chest dynamics"" device that will be built inside its CPR manikin has been carefully researched and engineered.  The combined manikin and device has been trademarked ""Chest Compression Charlie"" (we just call him ""Charlie"").</p>
<p>First of all, Charlie provides the realistic feel and sound of the tearing of cartilage and the breaking of ribs.  ""Never heard of this"" you say?  That is because it has historically been ignored in CPR training.  However, the AHA and others, including our beta test audience (especially the firefighters), state that these effects are a common occurrence.  The NIH states that rib cracking etc. effects (which occurred in 94% of their sample) are commonly under investigated and, therefore, are not reported. <strong> This replication of cartilage tearing and rib cracking is not offered by any other CPR manikin (thus the patent).</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/137185/files/20131016155012-HCRSayreredone.PNG?1381963812"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Since CPR training typically excludes these key chest dynamics, firefighters have told us that the ""tearing and cracking"" sounds can scare bystanders to such an extent that they stop performing chest compressions--defintely not the thing to do.</p>
<p>What else does Charlie do that is unique?  The AHA has stated that <strong>quality chest</strong> <strong>compressions (the now widely recognized key to survival) need to be at least 2 inches deep, delivered at a suggested 100 lbs of thrust, and performed at the rate of 100 compressions per minute.  As discussed in more detail below, Charlie is the only CPR manikin that will satisfy all of these guidelines. </strong></p>
<p>Studies at the University of Pennsylvania and elsewhere have shown that the human chest, once compressed, does not just pop back into place (as represented by so many of today's CPR manikins).  In reality, the recoil of the chest is ""damped"" as opposed to being linear. <strong> Charlie has been purposely designed to replicate such dynamics of the human chest during CPR (see graph below).</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/137214/files/20131016160607-HCRLarruChart4.PNG?1381964767"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>HERE IS A COMPARISON OF </strong><strong>CHARLIE'S FEATURES TO THOSE OF THE FIVE OTHER MANIKINS MOST SEEN IN THE MARKETPLACE:</strong></p>
<p><strong>(1)</strong>  Charlie will provide <strong>audible feedback</strong> when chest compressions achieve a depth of at least 2 inches (AHA guideline).  Only one of the other 5 manikins provides this sort of feedback, but at a depth of less than 2 inches.  Charlie's replication of the <strong>feel and sound of rib cracking etc</strong>. provides additional evidence that chest compressions are being done properly while also facilitating longer recall of the necessary psychomotor skills.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/137305/files/20131016165945-Bobrowrevised.PNG?1381967985"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>(2)</strong>  Charlie will provide a soundtrack of the Bee Gees ""Staying Alive"" (used by AHA in its training videos) to set the proper pace to achieve the AHA guideline of 100 compressions per minute.  This feature will also result in more ingrained psychomotor skills and, thereby, improved recall.  Such a pacing feature is not found in any other CPR manikin, although 1 of the 5 manikins does provide some guidance with compression rate.</p>
<p><strong>(3)</strong>  The ability of Charlie to replicate the nonlinear rebound of the chest during CPR provides a superior CPR training experience, because it provides an additional realistic hurdle to being able to achieve the AHA guideline of 100 compressions per minute.</p>
<p><strong>(4)</strong>  Charlie also brings more realism to CPR training, because it requires 100 lbs of thrust (as suggested by the AHA) to achieve the proper chest compression depth consistent with the proper chest compression rate.  2 of the other five CPR manikins require a thrust of only about 50 lbs and 3 require thrusts ranging from 78 to 84 lbs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>AND SO...</strong></p>
<p>As a result of its unique and <strong>groundbreaking features</strong>, Charlie will enable CPR trainees (both bystanders and professionals)<strong> to learn CPR faster, to learn CPR more</strong> <strong>effectively, and, as a result of the more intense ""feel and sound"" experience, to</strong> <strong>remember it longer</strong>.  This much more realistic training experience will give trainees the <strong>confidence that they will actually be able to save lives...and more lives will be saved.</strong></p>
<p>The HCR team and many others believe, given (1) the recent change in emphasis by the AHA to the importance of <strong>quality chest compressions</strong> versus breathing issues and, (2) the previous <strong>lack of realism</strong> of CPR training, that thousands of people throughout the world will need to be<strong> retrained</strong>.  With your help, HCR and Charlie will be able to play a significant role in this effort.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO MAKE THIS A REALITY?</strong></p>
<p>The first version of HCR's patented ""human chest dynamics"" device has been beta tested by AHA and Red Cross directors and training personnel, fire departments, hospitals, and others.  Based upon the positive feedback and suggestions received (see beta test comments below), HCR is currently designing and building the second and refined prototype of the device.  Once this occurs and our <strong>$50,000 goal is</strong> <strong>achieved,</strong> HCR will build a final manufacturing prototype of Charlie.  We have also set a <strong>stretch goal of $80,000</strong>, which if achieved, will allow us to to manufacture an initial small run of 25 units and sell most of them to the already enthusiastic beta test audience.  We will also use a few units for promotional purposes, initiate key marketing steps, and attend key trade shows.  These initial sales and market exposure should position HCR to raise additional funding to get Charlie into the marketplace either through licensing the patent or via direct manufacture and sale. <strong> We need your help to achieve these milestones (see below).</strong></p>

<p><strong>OUR TEAM</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dan May, President and Founder  </strong>Dan was a lifeguard and water safety instructor for the American Red Cross and taught CPR to new lifeguards.  This experience, combined with his experience of administering CPR to a victim, made it clear to him that there is a need for more realistic CPR training manikins.  In 2009, Dan filed a patent application for a new CPR training device and started sketching the first prototype.</p>
<p><strong>Bob Fick, Chief Operating Officer</strong>  Bob has an MBA and spent over 25 years as a chief financial officer of fast growing private and publicly traded technology companies, including leading several turnarounds.  Bob also provided management consulting services for ten years as business analyst and director for the Small Business Development Center in Tucson, Arizona.</p>
<p><strong>Larry Bramlett, Chief Engineer</strong>  Working with Dan, Larry has been responsible for the engineering design and development of the HCR ""human chest dynamics"" device and manikin torso.  Larry has over 39 years of experience as a design engineer, engineering manager, and project manager, and has managed up to forty engineers and designers in contiguous technical efforts, including significant projects for Citicorp and NCR.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Truax, VP Sales and Marketing</strong>  Wayne spent over 24 years in the beverage industry where he rapidly progressed from route sales supervisor to general manager.  While leading his organization, Wayne developed a reputation for creating marketing strategies that frequently led to setting new sales records.  He was then recruited to manage the startup of a new coffee enterprise in Tucson, Arizona.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</strong></p>
<p>The HCR team has previous experience launching new ventures and realizes that challenges remain before Charlie can enter the marketplace successfully.</p>
<p><strong>Complete Engineering and Design Effort</strong>  This effort will soon be completed for the second and more refined and extensive prototype.  The next task will be to convert some of the metal prototype materials to plastic while building the final manufacturing prototypes of the device and the torso manikin and optimizing manufacturing costs.</p>
<p><strong>Identify the Initial Manufacturer and Suppliers and Negotiate Costs</strong>  Good progress has already been made identifying suppliers and negotiating costs for many parts.  This will be completed soon.  Selection of a manufacturer will be next.</p>
<p><strong>Complete Initial Sales of Charlie to Key Customers</strong>  Initial sales of Charlie will be made to the beta test participants given their positive reactions to the device prototype.  This will result in getting Charlie exposed to some very key players with important roles in CPR training and emergency medical services, including the AHA, Red Cross, and many fire departments.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Funding</strong>  Based upon the initial sales of Charlie and demonstrated marketplace demand, we believe that HCR will be in a position to approach professional investors for the next round of funding.  This round will be used (1) to license Charlie's patent to an established manufacturer and marketer of CPR manikins or (2) for direct manufacture and sale.       </p>

Below are a slideshow and video made by one of Peter's friends - they are graphic - but show the healing process and progress Peter has made - and made so quickly thanks to all your support and good energy.


Peter has come very far but he's still in deep water...
Peter's long-time friend Alan Shoemaker writes:
""Peter Gorman is healing, it's a slow process... he'll eventually need a couple operations, skin grafts. He's strong and stubborn as a mule so he's pulling through this, thanks to his constitution. However, medical bills are what will kill him. Please, maybe you're read this before here and maybe you donated some funds to help. He's extremely grateful for all the help that has been sent his way, whether that was in the form of green energy or in your thoughts and prayers. He's still in deep water medically and financially, please take a look in your heart and in your pocketbook and see what you can do. Thanks!""

""...he has already spent 80 grand... and the two skin grafts, IF the leg is saved, will cost around 15 grand... and the antibotics he needs now and everything else, nursing care at home for a month, etc... so yes, this will bankrupt him easily... We can help. Please.""

Peter needs funds to help pay for medical costs - now.

Peter is a strong and modest man.
He's been bit and ripped and rocked before - but he needs our help. 
Let's help
As many of you know, Peter occasionally takes small groups of guests out to experience real magic and profound healing and life-changes - way out in the deep green.
When out there, Peter asks the Universe and the Spirits and God and whoever to send all the bad things his way - so that his guests can remain safe.
He's the ultimate jungle body gaurd.
He's put himself in harms way so many times - and so many times he's been a man of steel, stopped time, grabbed the bullet, turned it into a feather.But this time... this time... that bad-news bacterial bullet got him good.This time WE need to be his body guard.
Right now WE need to jump in front of it all - with a strong and awesome financial shield.
Let's do it, let's help.
Now - as soon as possible - in any amount - big or small.

Peter's the kind of guy who takes care of everyone. He's a giver.
He takes care of a huge extended family in Texas and Peru - probably around 20 people - with their emergencies, their bills, their troubles - he's done this for years without question.

This Facebook page has been set up to connect and get updated on the situation.

Please donate any amount big or small.

Regarding Perks & Rewards?
Right now - who knows...If possible we'll figure something out.
The big reward is for Peter, his family and friends and that he, and they, can all keep walking tall.

For the past year and a half I've been fighting cancer. After 13 painful months, 4 different hospitals and 2 cities I was finally diagnosed with Cancer. I went from specialist to specialist literally begging for help. All the doctors I had, would not listen to me or even follow the proper procedures of testing me for cancer. I was simply told that the mass that was found on my cervix which was causing me to hemorrhage constantly was part of my natural anatomy and that I needed to go home and let my body heal. The doctor would not even do a biopsy of my tumor and I had no idea at the time what procudure to ask for. I simply trusted the Doctors. When I asked for a second opinion they refused saying that I did not need one because I was healthy aside from my constant bleeding and pain and they refused to book me another appointment at St. Michael's Hospital. The doctor that first saw my tumor but refused to even give me a biopsy of the mass is currently a teaching Doctor at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, Canada.</p><p>My family doctor in Toronto and the specialists I was seeing offered me no professional help nor compassion. I was struggling to even work at this point, I was so desperately ill and could not stop the bleeding. I decided to go home for a visit to my hometown of London, Ontario. I ended up having to see a walk in clinic doctor and had to lie about my past doctors and say that I just started having my symptoms because I found that when Doctor's heard that I've been bouncing around from specialist to specialist I think they felt that I was lying or there was nothing truly wrong with me and wouldn't even have a look at me or test me. </p><p>The walk in Doctor from there sent me to see a specialist in London Ontario and after 2 biopsies of the mass it was discovered to be Cervical cancer. A few months later I had surgery at Sunnybrook Hospital, Toronto. During the surgery they discovered that I was stage 3 and the Cancer had spread to 2 lymphnodes and 18 lymphnodes along with my cervix had been removed. 24 hours after my surgery I was sent home from Toronto to London with a blood count of 64 out of 120 and a full blown infection. Four days after surgery I was admitted to London Health Sciences Center where I received 2 units of blood and 72 hours of intervenus antibiotics. My acting surgeon in London told me he was surprised I didn't die at home. The surgeon that did my operation would not return any of my calls nor would his secretary.</p><p>As soon as I was strong enough to eat again and walk again I started Pelvic Raditaion. They wanted to start me off with 1 external radiation, 2 internal radiations and 2 types of chemotherapy (cisplatnim &amp; F5U) Because I was so ill and weak from the stress and complications we decided to start off with 28 rounds of external radiation. After 20 rounds my radiation oncologist terminated my treatment due to complications. My only option now for treatment is alternative holistic cancer treatment. </p><p>My family has been supporting me for the past year as best they can but it's been extremely difficult for them. My mother is a single mom of 5 kids so we've never had money and my father is retired and 82.

<p>Caregivers
need help. The number of people becoming caregivers is rising every day, in
every community. It is estimated that 90
million Americans are providing care for loved ones who are chronically ill,
acutely ill, or suffering the limits of old age. One study reports that there
are 43.5 million individuals caring for someone with Dementia or Alzheimers
alone. In addition, there are over 3 million Registered Nurses and around 1
million doctors in the USA. When we add nursing assistants, therapists, technicians,
chiropractors, acupuncturists, clergy, advocates and many more - we are talking
about a really large number of caregivers.</p><p>Being
a caregiver is hard. The difficulties of being a caregiver can become a burden,
often carried in silence, wherein the needs of others override the need for
self-care. This opens the door for neglecting one’s own mental, emotional and
physical needs. This state of depletion, not only puts the caregivers health at
risk, but can also impact the quality of the care they are providing. Taking
time out for self-care is essential.</p><p></p>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><i>The Book – The Dance of Caring</i></b></p>
<p>We have written an inspirational book
that offers caregivers an opportunity to reset, breath and connect to self and
purpose. It reminds the caregiver to invest in self-care with the knowledge that
this is indeed not a selfish act, but one that renews their capacity to perform
with compassion and love. </p>
<p>This
book is a unique look at the world of caregiving and the importance of
self-care explored through the lens of the Native American Hoop Dance, a dance
centered around healing and a deep understanding of the shared human
experience. It is our hope that this book may assist caregivers in becoming
expansive in their own being, so that when they give care, they do so from a
place of abundance, strength and inner harmony.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><i>Self-Care

this is indeed not a selfish act, but one that renews their capacity to perform
with compassion and love. 
This
book is a unique look at the world of caregiving and the importance of
self-care explored through the lens of the Native American Hoop Dance, a dance
centered around healing and a deep understanding of the shared human
experience. It is our hope that this book may assist caregivers in becoming
expansive in their own being, so that when they give care, they do so from a
place of abundance, strength and inner harmony.
Self-Care
Events – The Dance of Caring
We have designed both on-line and in-person events that
offer caregivers a place to renew themselves, learn and practice self-care, and
bring forward practices that can be
integrated into their daily lives.
Why We Need Your Support
The Dance of Caring book is ready to go to print. In small
volumes the cost per book is prohibitive, severely limiting access. To make the book affordable, so that as many
caregivers as possible can benefit - we need to print in large volumes – which is
beyond our reach without financial help.
The programs we have designed are ready to be implemented. We
need some funds to implement them and get the work out. Our vision is to create
programs that can be easily integrated into the lives of caregivers. 
Beyond Money – Get Involved
- Here Are Some Ways

Share this with others who can help spread the
word
Let caregivers know that you care
Support a caregiver, so they can take some
self-care time
Gift copies of the book to caregivers who need
some inspiration
Sponsor a caregiver to a Dance of Caring online
or in person workshop

<h3 style=""color: #5abb47;"">Our Beliefs</h3>
<p>We believe that every Citizen has a right to be both a Customer and a Vendor. The problem is Advertising is too costly for most of us to be both, so we mostly get stuck being consumers to a few large Vendors. Well all of that is about to change, and not only have we made it possible for the little guy to get his message out to the world, we’ve done much more than that.</p>
<h3 style=""color: #5abb47;"">Current Problems (That we plan to solve)</h3>
<div>
<ul>
<li>No easy way to Remember Events, Promotions, Ads, etc.</li>

<p>Well it is pretty simple really! The holy grail of Advertising is having others ""Remember"" what you are promoting, right?</p>
<p>So lets say you are promoting a 25% Off Jeans in July Sale! Well you most likely want to start promoting this sale at least a month early so you can get as many people in, to save a little money as you try to off-load those jeans from inventory. Each person that sees your Announcement will be able to click ""Remember This"" and keep up with it in their Memory Bank.</p>
<p>This means anytime they go into their Memory Bank(inbox/calendaring system) between the date they Remembered your promotion and the date it expires,that ""25% Off Jeans in July Sale!"" is going to be slowly, but surely working its way into the members vision. All Announcements on Free Your Memory are time sensitive and can be <em>sorted</em>  ""chronologically"" if that is the sort option that is chosen.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h1>Short Summary</h1>
<p>Most of your online data is held in datastores of privately owned companies, with obscure privacy policies. What about getting back control, and keeping your data in the safety of your kitchen, while still reaching it from anywhere in the world? What about communicating with your friends in private and secure way, without disclosing it to anyone but the real recipients?</p>
<p>I want to create a Raspberry Pi based box and an Android™ application that lets you do just that. The set up should be trivial for non-technical people, and you can reach your files, contacts and calendars from your phone, from wherever you may be. The Tor network guarrantees that you don't even expose the location of your precious stuff to the public, yet you find your way to it. In the future, it will also be possible to set up communication channels between compatible devices that cannot be tampered with, and no eavesdropping is possible.</p>
<h1>Who am I?</h1>
<p>I've worked at a renowned security company for 1,5 years, developing an appliance that targeted the enterprise (not the spaceship, though). I have been coding for almost 10 years now, and have gained professional experience in handling and architecting complex projects, along with some clues about project management. I quit my job, moved to Glasgow to do a degree in Computer Science and Business and Management, and I'm committed to work on high-quality open-source software to support myself.</p>
<h1>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h1>
<p>I need roughly $35 000 to work on this project for a year, the majority of which I will spend on the perks, and the rest on living costs. If I can't meet the goal, but receive enough funding for a couple of months, I will start the project anyway, and will work on it for as long as I can. For the schedule and the planned features from a technological point of view you should consult the <a href=""https://github.com/KitchenSync/implementation_plans"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<h3>What does the package include?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi</li>
<li>32GB SD card</li>
<li>case</li>
<li>wall brick</li>
<li>1m patch cable</li>
<li>stickers</li>
</ul><h1>How does it look like?</h1>
<p>In collaboration with the wonderful guys at <a href=""http://ModMyPi.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ModMyPi</a>, I am happy to tell you that your KitchenSync box will look absolutely stunning beside your router. A picture is worth a thousand words, so here you go. Fitted with a KitchenSync logo, your device will sport this cool case when it gets to your door.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://www.modmypi.com/shop/image/cache/data/raspberry-pi-cases/black-red/raspberry-pi-case-black-red-2-500x500.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h1>What happens if you don't reach your goal?</h1>
<p>In case I don't reach the desired goal of $35 000, I'm going to work on the project for as long as I can anyway. I'm willing to deliver everybody their perks, but if I collect only a handful of money, that means that I can't work on this full-time, and some delays are to be expected. I'm optimistic about the effort it takes to make a usable product, and I'm convinced that even if I can only work on this project part-time, your perks will be delivered with minimal delays.</p>
<h1>The Impact</h1>
<p>With the widespread use of smartphones, and the decline of the desktop computer, it is natural that the way you store and access your personal files needed a change. Corporations were built on the simple concept of handling your mail, your personal files, your relationships, and, basically, everything about you that can be expressed in bits and bytes. You don't have to store practically anything on your laptop anymore if you have an active Internet connection, which, chances are, you have all the time in your palm.</p>
<p>The data you upload to such services are stored in huge datastores of those companies, basically magical black boxes, in which you put stuff, and you can retrieve it when you need it. The problem with the magical black boxes is that you don't, and can't know how it works, let alone control what happens in there. You cannot know how your data is handled, and who can access it, and how safely it is stored. Employees of the service provider, or national secret services may interact with your stuff without your or anyone's knowledge or permission.</p>
<p>I've started to abandon the corporate cloud and moved to a virtual private server I rent a couple of months ago. It has been working fine, but lacks certain features I have wanted to implement from the beginning. Thinking about the work to create a system that is suitable for only myself and then document it for technical-minded people is just overwhelming compared to the work that a hopefully one-size-fits-all solution would require to implement.</p>
<p>Thus came the idea of KitchenSync, that will let me and you take our data home, and trust it to open-source, free software, and a box that can be simply unplugged to take it offline. The user experience should be straightforward, portable, and familiar to anyone. Unlike current solutions, you don't have to install software to VPSs, keep your desktop computer running, or tinker with your home router settings so that you can reach it from the outside. All of these should be handled automatically. Using open standards ensures that you're not locked in to using only KitchenSync software for accessing or serving your data.</p>
<p>The KitchenSync simply has to be plugged in to the mains and your router, and with the app on your Android phone that is connected to your home WiFi, you can set it up instantly. From then on, you'll be able to use it just like your Google or iCloud account, wherever you are. All of the KitchenSync related software will be both free of charge, and free to tinker with, released under the MIT license. For technical details and specific features implemented in the different milestones I set, check out the repository on GitHub.</p>
<h1>Other Ways You Can Help</h1>
<p>You may join and contribute to the project not only through contributing funds, but many other ways as well: contribute code on GitHub, artwork, ideas, or any other way you think would be beneficial for reaching the ultimate world dominanation. If you're not a technical person, I'll be grateful for a tweet, a share, a like, a +1, a mail on your favourite mailing list, or a link pasted to the IRC channel you see fit. Indiegogo provides one-click solutions for many of these, feel free to use them.</p>
<h1>What about FreedomBox?</h1>
<p>I've only come across the FreedomBox project recently, and still decided I should do a separate solution for a similar problem. The FreedomBox project started a couple of years ago, and as of yet, they did not release any stable-looking bundles. I also think that FreedomBox serves a different purpose than KitchenSync, although I might end up incorporating similar functionality into KitchenSync at some point.</p>
<p>The features the FreedomBox team wants to push into the stable version seem to be more targeted at journalists, and freedom rights activists, where top-notch encryption is crucial. There's nothing wrong with that. My goal, though, is to provide a solution for ordinary people, where they can store their private data, like contacts, calendars, to-do lists and files, and backups, and reach it from either their laptop or their mobile phone wherever they may be, and feel secure about it. I want the whole process to take no effort, and be as convenient, fluid and straightforward as possible.</p></div>","Short Summary

In the future, it will also be possible to set up communication channels between compatible devices that cannot be tampered with, and no eavesdropping is possible.
Who am I?
I've worked at a renowned security company for 1,5 years, developing an appliance that targeted the enterprise (not the spaceship, though). I have been coding for almost 10 years now, and have gained professional experience in handling and architecting complex projects, along with some clues about project management. I quit my job, moved to Glasgow to do a degree in Computer Science and Business and Management, and I'm committed to work on high-quality open-source software to support myself.
What I Need & What You Get
I need roughly $35 000 to work on this project for a year, the majority of which I will spend on the perks, and the rest on living costs. If I can't meet the goal, but receive enough funding for a couple of months, I will start the project anyway, and will work on it for as long as I can. For the schedule and the planned features from a technological point of view you should consult the GitHub repository.
What does the package include?

Raspberry Pi
32GB SD card
case
wall brick
1m patch cable
stickers
How does it look like?
In collaboration with the wonderful guys at ModMyPi, I am happy to tell you that your KitchenSync box will look absolutely stunning beside your router. A picture is worth a thousand words, so here you go. Fitted with a KitchenSync logo, your device will sport this cool case when it gets to your door.

What happens if you don't reach your goal?
In case I don't reach the desired goal of $35 000, I'm going to work on the project for as long as I can anyway. I'm willing to deliver everybody their perks, but if I collect only a handful of money, that means that I can't work on this full-time, and some delays are to be expected. I'm optimistic about the effort it takes to make a usable product, and I'm convinced that even if I can only work on this project part-time, your perks will be delivered with minimal delays.
The Impact
With the widespread use of smartphones, and the decline of the desktop computer, it is natural that the way you store and access your personal files needed a change. Corporations were built on the simple concept of handling your mail, your personal files, your relationships, and, basically, everything about you that can be expressed in bits and bytes. You don't have to store practically anything on your laptop anymore if you have an active Internet connection, which, chances are, you have all the time in your palm.
The data you upload to such services are stored in huge datastores of those companies, basically magical black boxes, in which you put stuff, and you can retrieve it when you need it. The problem with the magical black boxes is that you don't, and can't know how it works, let alone control what happens in there. You cannot know how your data is handled, and who can access it, and how safely it is stored. Employees of the service provider, or national secret services may interact with your stuff without your or anyone's knowledge or permission.
I've started to abandon the corporate cloud and moved to a virtual private server I rent a couple of months ago. It has been working fine, but lacks certain features I have wanted to implement from the beginning. Thinking about the work to create a system that is suitable for only myself and then document it for technical-minded people is just overwhelming compared to the work that a hopefully one-size-fits-all solution would require to implement.
Thus came the idea of KitchenSync, that will let me and you take our data home, and trust it to open-source, free software, and a box that can be simply unplugged to take it offline. The user experience should be straightforward, portable, and familiar to anyone. Unlike current solutions, you don't have to install software to VPSs, keep your desktop computer running, or tinker with your home router settings so that you can reach it from the outside. All of these should be handled automatically. Using open standards ensures that you're not locked in to using only KitchenSync software for accessing or serving your data.
The KitchenSync simply has to be plugged in to the mains and your router, and with the app on your Android phone that is connected to your home WiFi, you can set it up instantly. From then on, you'll be able to use it just like your Google or iCloud account, wherever you are. All of the KitchenSync related software will be both free of charge, and free to tinker with, released under the MIT license. For technical details and specific features implemented in the different milestones I set, check out the repository on GitHub.
Other Ways You Can Help
You may join and contribute to the project not only through contributing funds, but many other ways as well: contribute code on GitHub, artwork, ideas, or any other way you think would be beneficial for reaching the ultimate world dominanation. If you're not a technical person, I'll be grateful for a tweet, a share, a like, a +1, a mail on your favourite mailing list, or a link pasted to the IRC channel you see fit. Indiegogo provides one-click solutions for many of these, feel free to use them.
What about FreedomBox?
I've only come across the FreedomBox project recently, and still decided I should do a separate solution for a similar problem. The FreedomBox project started a couple of years ago, and as of yet, they did not release any stable-looking bundles. I also think that FreedomBox serves a different purpose than KitchenSync, although I might end up incorporating similar functionality into KitchenSync at some point.
The features the FreedomBox team wants to push into the stable version seem to be more targeted at journalists, and freedom rights activists, where top-notch encryption is crucial. There's nothing wrong with that. My goal, though, is to provide a solution for ordinary people, where they can store their private data, like contacts, calendars, to-do lists and files, and backups, and reach it from either their laptop or their mobile phone wherever they may be, and feel secure about it. I want the whole process to take no effort, and be as convenient, fluid and straightforward as possible.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hello.</p>
<p>My name is Jennifer Johnson. I was diagnosed with IHSS, now called HOCM (Hypertrophic Obstructive CardioMyopathy - Heart Disease)  in February of 2011 when I was 5 months pregnant with my son. I am a 30 years old woman, married to my wonderful husband, Robert, with two beautiful children - my daughter Mikayla who is 2 1/2 and my son Malykai who is 1. (Pictured Above)</p>
<p>During the course of my heart journey, since diagnosis, I have found out that I need open heart surgery to have a septal myomectomy and a mechanical mitral valve replacement. Further conversation with this surgeon has made me understand that surgery is needed very soon. In his words, ""There aren’t very many cases like you out walking around.""</p>
<p>In an extensive conversation with the surgeon, I found out that I need to get my dental work fixed before I can continue with my heart journey. I have neglected my teeth for some time now because of the overwhelming expense of dental work vs the expense of caring for two small children; my kids have always won. I am now in serious need of some pretty expensive procedures. Being on Medicaid and having what they call a ""share of cost"", bills are stacking up that we don’t have the money for. Now I have to think about paying for my teeth before fixing my heart. I am concerned if I am even going to make it until surgery.</p>
<p>My husband works a low wage job, less then full time, trying to support the 4 of us. He is a very dedicated man who will stop at nothing to make sure he keeps a roof over our head. Most often he works his regular job and then goes off in the evenings to complete side work to make ends meet.</p>
<p>With my current medical standing, it has caused him a great deal of stress about how we are going to afford everything - from dental work needed before surgery and then surgical after-care while he has to work to continue to provide. We have currently hit a major financial road block.</p>
<p>Today to ask for help to get the proper dental work completed so that I can move on with my open heart surgery and continue to care for my two beautiful children who mean the world to me.</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

Palmer says,<strong> </strong>""Personally, when I hit the 4 hour mark on a long flight, I couldn't stand just sitting there for one more minute and getting up to stretch my legs wasn't always an option. I've done 12 successful test flights where FlyteBiking prevented cabin fever and jet lag!

FlyteBike™ has unique, patent pending design features which separate it from other stationary pedal devices.  FlyteBike Portable Pedals is 3 ½ pounds, folds flat and goes anywhere with you in its own bag.Unlike other pedal products which are made of heavy steel, with rods that can heat up and burn you, FlyteBike™ has been designed with a Patent Pending lightweight aluminum, which does not conduct heat.Here's more good news... you'll burn 10 calories for every minute that you gently pedal with FlyteBike™, that's 300 calories in just 30 minutes while sitting at your desk or watching your favorite TV show. Now you can feel great, live longer and get fit, anytime, anywhere.Here's more exciting news! We're also rolling out FlyteBike Smart Pedal™ sensor and tracking app here at IndieGoGo! Our Smart Pedal™ is a digital IoT (Internet of Things) add-on for use with Corporate Wellness and healthcare discounts, physical therapy, and for tracking personal progress.                    WHY FLYTEBIKE™?Broadway Star turned serial inventor, Robin Palmer, couldn't stand just sitting there for one more minute during her day. She says, ""Necessity has always been the mother of my inventions. I asked myself, 'What if I could fit in my fitness during my work day? What if I could prevent cabin fever, blood clots and jet lag right from my seat on an airplane?''Sitting is the New Smoking. Have you ever added up all the time you spend sitting every day? Most of us sit at work all day and then go home and sit three to four more hours every night in front of a computer, laptop or television screen. It’s easy to see how most people could spend up to fourteen hours a day in a sedentary seated position. Sitting all day has taken a serious toll on our health and bodies.Has Flying Got You Down? Blood clots affect 900,000 Americans and kill 160,000 of them every year. Flying is a leading cause, due to sitting for hours in cabin pressure, which restricts the flow of oxygen. Palmer says, ""Personally, when I hit the 4 hour mark on a long flight, I couldn't stand just sitting there for one more minute and getting up to stretch my legs wasn't always an option. I've done 12 successful test flights where FlyteBiking prevented cabin fever and jet lag! Also, surprising but true: TSA agents have never once mentioned or inspected my FlyteBike bag and flight attendants and passengers don't even notice I am pedaling in my seat!""It's All About the Blood Flow. Research shows that pedaling is the perfect way to pump blood to your brain and throughout your body. Pedaling for just a few minutes during your day boosts your mood and your metabolism!Just like strolling on the treadmill desk, the goal is gentle movement to oxygenate your blood. Don't worry, you won't be sweating at work or on the plane... unless, of course, you want to!FLYTEBIKE IS NEAT™ CERTIFIEDNEAT™ stands for the science of Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis, developed by Mayo Clinic.WHERE CAN YOU FLYTEBIKE™?You can feel better, lose weight and live longer by pedaling just minutes a day anytime, anywhere – at work, at home, on the go - even on long flights! ​​Successful business owner increases productivity at work.

</h3> <p>My friend Sarah is in a very difficult position.  She's 6 months pregnant, has unjustly been terminated from her job, and has lost her home due to uncontrollable circumstances.  She has no parents or siblings.

<p>I am able to help her find used and bargain items, as well as lend her a few hundred dollars, but she needs a small nest egg in order to provide for her daughter due in January 2015.  She has a business plan on the back burner that she is eager to implement next summer, once Blythe is a few months old.  The plan contains details, prices, and forms for running her at home daycare.  Sarah was a nanny for several years, so she has the experience and skills to manage a daycare business.</p>
<p>Sarah is ambitious, smart, and energetic.  She has the will to overcome any barrier, but she has hit a very low point, and needs some financial resources. With your help, she can pick herself up and confidently move forward in her life.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The $3,500 that I am aiming for will be enough for Sarah to:</p>

<p>Gary's patience, lightness and non-judgmental approach
provided an open and relaxed setting for the reading.  The language he used was so clarifying,
insightful and helpful. His passion and knowledge of Vedic Astrology is
inspiring and I feel more at peace knowing more about who I really am and how
the planets truly influence my life. 
Thank you, Gary. </p>

<p>Gary's depth of knowledge is unreal. His education in
Ayurveda contributes greatly to his understanding. I think Gary has three major
gifts to bring to his readings that are not often combined. The first is his
intellectual ability and passion for knowledge; the second is the deep
compassion and empathy that Gary carries through his work and the third is
complete professionalism, in confidentiality and all other aspects. I completely
recommend him for anyone wanting to delve deeper into Astrology.</p>
<p>CM</p>
<p>Gary's readings are clear and well stated.  He is very clear on planetary energies and their impact through living a Vedic lifestyle - not just from a theoretically achieved knowledge.<br/></p>

<p>Proprietary software allows  iTraq to stay in sleep mode most of the time - this helps to minimize energy consumption and achieve an amazing battery lifetime.</p>
<p>Depending on the schedule set by user, iTraq wakes up, determines its location by scanning cellular towers in range and transmits data to the server.</p>
<p>Then all the location information is displayed on your mobile phone or on the website.</p>

<p>iTraq’s Mobile Application allows you to activate iTraq and manage all the iTraqs that you have. Each iTraq can be assigned a name and a separate alarm ringtone. The number of iTraqs that can be tracked and logged in the application is limitless.</p>
<p>For each iTraq you can view the map that contains a history of its locations with time stamps.</p>
<p>You can always check the status of iTraq and its remaining lifetime. Or you can change the frequency of wake-ups, depending on your needs.  </p>

<p>Sometimes it’s important not only to know where the iTraq is but to detect if it has suddenly left the designated area (for example, a boat near the summer house slips its mooring). To this end, we came up with the Guard mode. You can specify the radius on the map and if the iTraq goes beyond this pre-set radius, you will receive an alert on the mobile phone. </p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;color: #dc5a5a;font-size: 16px;"">Is this a one-time fee for the iTraq device or there is an additional subscription or fee to track an object?</span><br/>The fee is all-inclusive. All communication expenses are included in the price, so there is no additional charge for tracking.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;color: #dc5a5a;font-size: 16px;"">Really one-time fee? I really do not understand how it can be one-time fee. There is a SIM Card for GSM communication and feedback, how can that be a lifetime subscription?</span><br/>Yes, correct, this is a one-time fee. We estimate that iTraq during its life will make roughly near 1500 communication cycles, which it about 3 years of iTraq life for once-a-day report cycle. Based on this estimations we have made an exclusive agreement with our communication provider. So, all these expenses are already included in price and there is not additional charge for the user.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;color: #dc5a5a;font-size: 16px;"">What after 3 years of use or when battery is discharged?</span><br/>iTraq is sold with communication cost included in price. So, when you buy it, you pay for the device and communication. Battery that runs iTraq is enough for 1500 communication cycles, exactly the same amount of communications cycles is included in price of iTraq. So, when battery is discharged (or cycles are over, that should happen at the same time) you need to recharge both - battery &amp; communication credits. We'll announce the service to RECHARGE iTraq when we pass the beta testing stage. The cost of this service will be less comparing to the cost of a new iTraq.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;color: #dc5a5a;font-size: 16px;"">How can you be sure it works worldwide?</span><br/>The iTraq will be shipped with GSM SIM card installed on the factory. We have signed an exclusive agreement with our communication provider to service us Globally. That guarantees that iTraq will work everywhere where cellular service exists, which is pretty much everywhere in the world.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;color: #dc5a5a;font-size: 16px;"">Will iTraq work in Japan and South Korea?</span><br/>There is no GSM networks in Japan &amp; South Korea, so the iTraq will not be able to operate there.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;color: #dc5a5a;font-size: 16px;"">Do you provide the SIM cards?</span><br/>Yes, iTraq is shipped with SIM card installed on the factory, so you DON'T need to buy your own SIM card and pay for the service.</p>

       iTraq is a cellular tracking device - the world’s first global location device that can be found anywhere. iTraq determines its location using cellular towers allowing iTraq to be located anywhere in the world where cellular service exists.       When we were thinking how to design the iTraq the best way, we tried to make a device that is much better than similar devices on the market. So, Why is iTraq better? While other location devices claim they can be found anywhere over large distances, the truth is that they are all using Bluetooth wireless technology. Why is that important for the user? Bluetooth has a small detection radius (tens, hundreds of feet maximum), which greatly limits its scope of use to household devices, such as keys, remote controls, etc. 
Since iTraq determines its location using cellular towers, its radius extends as far and as wide as all cellular towers.  This, in turn, allows you to attach iTraq to a bicycle or boat, place it in the pocket of your child, or even  attach it to your baggage, and still be detected even if your baggage travelled to another country or continent. Most other devices that work globally, like GPS technology, are known as very power intensive consumers of battery life.  Even the most recent advances in battery life only allow a GPS device to work several days if not only hours.iTraq uses Cell-ID technology and lets you adjust how often iTraq should report its location, from a few times in an hour to a few times in a day, and can work up to 3 years without the need to recharge a battery. Most other devices comparable to iTraq are likely to come in very bulky form factors that make it impractical to place or locate.However, iTraq is as small as a credit card, only slightly thicker - like 5 cards together. It can be placed in a glove compartment of the car or even hidden under the seat of your mountain bike. It can also be hung on the strap or stuck on a flat surface with an adhesive strip that is supplied with iTraq.   Is GPS-level accuracy really needed for these applications? We believe it is not. iTraq allows enough precision to let you know if your child is in school or on a football field, or if your car is at home or in the parking lot. iTraq does not use GPS, but it does use a technology that scans cellular towers that are in proximity to determine its location. The more towers it sees, the more precisely iTraq can determine its location.  
 
  
Proprietary software allows  iTraq to stay in sleep mode most of the time - this helps to minimize energy consumption and achieve an amazing battery lifetime.
Depending on the schedule set by user, iTraq wakes up, determines its location by scanning cellular towers in range and transmits data to the server.
Then all the location information is displayed on your mobile phone or on the website.
 

 

 


        

 
iTraq’s Mobile Application allows you to activate iTraq and manage all the iTraqs that you have. Each iTraq can be assigned a name and a separate alarm ringtone. The number of iTraqs that can be tracked and logged in the application is limitless.
For each iTraq you can view the map that contains a history of its locations with time stamps.
You can always check the status of iTraq and its remaining lifetime. Or you can change the frequency of wake-ups, depending on your needs.  
 
 


 
Sometimes it’s important not only to know where the iTraq is but to detect if it has suddenly left the designated area (for example, a boat near the summer house slips its mooring). To this end, we came up with the Guard mode. You can specify the radius on the map and if the iTraq goes beyond this pre-set radius, you will receive an alert on the mobile phone. 


 
 
 

We have completed the Test Board stage which is the first prototype of our device. Our engineers used this phase to connect external peripheral devices to complete the testing, debugging, and power consumption measurements. We have also finished developing the module firmware and completed the testing against the Test Board. iTraq has successfully proven that our concept works and now have the first production release in development mode.

We are very excited to deliver iTraqs to our first 100 beta testers in August 2015.
We plan to receive feedback about the device and applications, fix them and deliver final iTraqs to everyone in September.

Is this a one-time fee for the iTraq device or there is an additional subscription or fee to track an object?The fee is all-inclusive. All communication expenses are included in the price, so there is no additional charge for tracking.
Really one-time fee? I really do not understand how it can be one-time fee. There is a SIM Card for GSM communication and feedback, how can that be a lifetime subscription?Yes, correct, this is a one-time fee. We estimate that iTraq during its life will make roughly near 1500 communication cycles, which it about 3 years of iTraq life for once-a-day report cycle. Based on this estimations we have made an exclusive agreement with our communication provider. So, all these expenses are already included in price and there is not additional charge for the user.
What after 3 years of use or when battery is discharged?iTraq is sold with communication cost included in price. So, when you buy it, you pay for the device and communication. Battery that runs iTraq is enough for 1500 communication cycles, exactly the same amount of communications cycles is included in price of iTraq. So, when battery is discharged (or cycles are over, that should happen at the same time) you need to recharge both - battery & communication credits. We'll announce the service to RECHARGE iTraq when we pass the beta testing stage. The cost of this service will be less comparing to the cost of a new iTraq.
How can you be sure it works worldwide?The iTraq will be shipped with GSM SIM card installed on the factory. We have signed an exclusive agreement with our communication provider to service us Globally. That guarantees that iTraq will work everywhere where cellular service exists, which is pretty much everywhere in the world.
Will iTraq work in Japan and South Korea?There is no GSM networks in Japan & South Korea, so the iTraq will not be able to operate there.
Do you provide the SIM cards?Yes, iTraq is shipped with SIM card installed on the factory, so you DON'T need to buy your own SIM card and pay for the service.
If I fly back to China, and I have iTraq attached on my backpack in the airplane which is in the sky, would my parents in China still able to find my position in the APP? Then when I land in China, will it work in China too?iTraq uses cellular operators to determine its location and to transmit the data, so when you are on the plane it won’t be able to scan towers nearby and connect to report its location. However, when you land in China it will be able to detect your location during the next wake-up cycle, transmit data, so your parent will know you arrived.
How can I recharge the battery inside my iTraq device?The iTraq battery is not rechargeable at this time, but we are creating a service to replace the battery. This service will be announced in June, when our first devices are released.
Does iTraq have GPS or Bluetooth inside?No, iTraq does not use GPS or Bluetooth technology. It determines its location by scanning cellular towers nearby. This is why iTraq can be located anywhere in the world where cellular service exists.
Is it possible to determine when the polling period starts?Yes, it will be a possibility to define when the wake-up schedule should be active.
Will there be flexibility to have the tracking every hour for some parts of the day and for it to “sleep” longer in other parts of the day? For example, I have a mother with Alzheimers and I would like to track her every hour in the afternoon and evening, but this information would not be required between midnight and midday.Yes, it will work exactly as it’s explained above. It will be a very flexible, but easy to understand way to setup and manage wake-up schedules.
I know I can setup up the iTraq to report its location, e.g. once a day 5pm each day.

<h3>Patryk Jendruchniewicz pamięta, że wiśnie mają kolor czerwony...</h3>
<p>Miał dwa lata z kawałeczkiem, kiedy zdiagnozowano chorobę. Najpierw przechodził chemioterapię. Później była m.in. radioterapia. Był pierwszym dzieckiem w Polsce, które lekarze leczyli tą metodą w przypadku choroby oczu. <br/><br/>Z początku terapia przynosiła skutek. Potem trzeba było usunąć jedno oko, a w lutym 2012 roku drugie. Nie było wyjścia. Nowotwór tworzył już nacieki na mózg. Patryk przed operacją mówił, ze wolalby nie żyć, niż nie widziec. Ale teraz jest bardzo dzielny. Powiedzial tylko ze smutnkiem:  ""już nigdy nie zobaczę mamy""</p>
<p>10-latek mieszka z rodziną we wsi Bedlno koło Radzynia Podlaskiego w bardzo trudnych warunkach.</p>
<p>7-osobowa rodzina posiada mieszkanie o powierzchni zaledwie 17 metrów kwadratowych. To niecałe 2.5 metra na osobę! Nie jest łatwo. W małym <span id=""nsitsp_0"" style=""display: inline; color: #0000ff; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; padding-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 1px; cursor: pointer; margin: 0; float: none;""></span>pokoju mieszka razem z czwórką rodzeństwa. Wciąż potyka się o stojące w pokoju łóżka, nie ma własnego miejsca.</p>
<h3>Czego potrzeba najbardziej?</h3>
<p>Kiedy spytano Patryka, jakie jest jego marzenie - powiedział, że chciałby zbudować ""chatkę"" i mieć swój pokój. I łazienkę, której teraz nie ma. Toaleta znajduje się kilkadziesiąt metrów od budynku mieszkalnego</p>
<p>Budowa już się zaczęła, ale rodzinie brakuje pieniędzy. Został do zrobienia dach, instalacja elektryczna, tynki. podłogi, instalacja sanitarna. Koszty to jeszcze ok. 30–35 tys. zł.  <br/>Zbiórka trwa. Niektórzy darczyńcy kontaktują się bezpośrednio z rodziną i przywożą materiały budowlane.</p>
<p><img alt=""Domek rośnie..."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-_giN-CG8GYc/Ue-3LUAVWsI/AAAAAAAAANY/PFNXkZodr04/s640/Patryk-cottage.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Dlaczego pomoc jest konieczna?</h3>
<p>Rodzina Patryka wydała na leczenie wszystkie środki, jakimi dysponowała i te, które napłynęły w formie pomocy.</p>
<p>Osobny pokoj dla Patryka jest tak ważny dlatego, że tylko wtedy odnajdzie  za kazdym razem przedmioty. które pozostawił. Potrzebuje spokoju, uczy sie Braille'a i życia w mroku.</p>
<p>Szybka pomoc ma ogromne znaczenie, a czas nagli, bo dobrze byłoby zakończyć budowę przed zimą.</p>
<p>Wyobrażam sobie zarówno tę radość rodziców Patryka, jak i wiarę jego samego, że marzenia sie spelniają</p>
<p><br/>I pomyślec, ile możemy dać komus w wielkiej życiowej potrzebie - przesyłajac jakies tam 10 zl...</p>

Patryk Jendruchniewicz pamięta, że wiśnie mają kolor czerwony...
Miał dwa lata z kawałeczkiem, kiedy zdiagnozowano chorobę. Najpierw przechodził chemioterapię. Później była m.in. radioterapia. Był pierwszym dzieckiem w Polsce, które lekarze leczyli tą metodą w przypadku choroby oczu. Z początku terapia przynosiła skutek. Potem trzeba było usunąć jedno oko, a w lutym 2012 roku drugie. Nie było wyjścia. Nowotwór tworzył już nacieki na mózg. Patryk przed operacją mówił, ze wolalby nie żyć, niż nie widziec. Ale teraz jest bardzo dzielny. Powiedzial tylko ze smutnkiem:  ""już nigdy nie zobaczę mamy""
10-latek mieszka z rodziną we wsi Bedlno koło Radzynia Podlaskiego w bardzo trudnych warunkach.
7-osobowa rodzina posiada mieszkanie o powierzchni zaledwie 17 metrów kwadratowych. To niecałe 2.5 metra na osobę! Nie jest łatwo. W małym pokoju mieszka razem z czwórką rodzeństwa. Wciąż potyka się o stojące w pokoju łóżka, nie ma własnego miejsca.
Czego potrzeba najbardziej?
Kiedy spytano Patryka, jakie jest jego marzenie - powiedział, że chciałby zbudować ""chatkę"" i mieć swój pokój. I łazienkę, której teraz nie ma. Toaleta znajduje się kilkadziesiąt metrów od budynku mieszkalnego
Budowa już się zaczęła, ale rodzinie brakuje pieniędzy. Został do zrobienia dach, instalacja elektryczna, tynki. podłogi, instalacja sanitarna. Koszty to jeszcze ok. 30–35 tys. zł.  Zbiórka trwa. Niektórzy darczyńcy kontaktują się bezpośrednio z rodziną i przywożą materiały budowlane.

Dlaczego pomoc jest konieczna?
Rodzina Patryka wydała na leczenie wszystkie środki, jakimi dysponowała i te, które napłynęły w formie pomocy.
Osobny pokoj dla Patryka jest tak ważny dlatego, że tylko wtedy odnajdzie  za kazdym razem przedmioty. które pozostawił. Potrzebuje spokoju, uczy sie Braille'a i życia w mroku.
Szybka pomoc ma ogromne znaczenie, a czas nagli, bo dobrze byłoby zakończyć budowę przed zimą.
Wyobrażam sobie zarówno tę radość rodziców Patryka, jak i wiarę jego samego, że marzenia sie spelniają
I pomyślec, ile możemy dać komus w wielkiej życiowej potrzebie - przesyłajac jakies tam 10 zl...

      English version

Patrick is suffering from cancer that attacked his eyes. his eyeballs were removed. It was the only way to save his life.Patrick Jendruchniewicz remembers that cherries are red...He was two years old when the disease was diagnosed. First was the chemotherapy. Later radiotherapy.He was the first child in Poland, which doctors treated by this method in the case of eye cancer.

 

At first, the results  of therapy were promising and effective. Then doctors had to remove one eye, and in February 2012 the second. There was no other way.The tumor infiltrates already created on the brain. Patrick said before the surgery that he would rather be dead than not see. But now he is very brave. He said only sadly: ""I will never see my mom""

 
10-year-old Patrick lives with his family in a Bedlno village near Radzyń Podlaski (Poland) very low quality of housing.7 seater family owns an apartment with an area of only 17 square meters (approximately 180 sq ft). It is less than 2.5 (26 sq ft) meters per person! It is not easy. In a small room with four siblings. Patrick as that he is blind, has a big issue navigate in a room laden with beds and other furniture. There is no place for him.
 
What is now most needed?When Patrick was asked about his dream - he said he wanted to build a ""cottage"" and have his own room. And a bathroom, which now does not exist. The toilet is located nearly 100 meters from a residential buildingConstruction has already started, but the family does not have money anymore. It is to build: the roof, wiring, plaster. flooring, plumbing. The costs are still about 30-35 thousand PLN(approx. $ 12,000)Collecting the money lasts. Some donors interact directly with the family and bring building materials.
 
Why our help is so important?Patrick's family released for treatment all the money available to it and those who received as a gift aid.A separate room for Patrick is so needed. He needs peace, he must learn Braille and learn how to live in darkness.Help is needed now. Every day is important. Time is pressing. It would be fantastic to complete construction before winter.

<h3><strong>STAYING STRONG SINCE 4.17.09</strong></h3>
<p><strong>KEEPING THE FAITH</strong></p>
<p><strong> I would like to tell you about my son, 21 yr old Zach Jackson. At the age of 18, he and a couple friends were enjoying life and hanging out on the Red River when they left to go pick up some other friends.  As they were going to pick up these friends, Zach looked in the rear view mirror and saw a vehicle coming up behind him at a high rate of speed. THIS caused Zach to veer off the road in order to keep from being hit.  His SUV flipped and life changed in the blink of an eye, not just for Zach, but all involved.  Most important lives changed forever. Zach suffers now from a brain stem injury and can not talk, walk or eat, and lives in a nursing home that is strictly geared for the elderly. We are trying to raise funds all the time to help Zach with care that insurance will not pay for, a special vehicle for him, and remodeling our home so when he does come for visits, he is accommodated. We normally have to travel to get him treatments since there is not a Traumatic Brain Injury Rehab Center anywhere near us.  We also have to purchase medical equipment, physical therapy, and supplements for him that insurance will not cover.  When we purchase out of pocket medical equipment, I always look for the floor models or slightly used and demos.

KEEPING THE FAITH
 I would like to tell you about my son, 21 yr old Zach Jackson. At the age of 18, he and a couple friends were enjoying life and hanging out on the Red River when they left to go pick up some other friends.  As they were going to pick up these friends, Zach looked in the rear view mirror and saw a vehicle coming up behind him at a high rate of speed. THIS caused Zach to veer off the road in order to keep from being hit.  His SUV flipped and life changed in the blink of an eye, not just for Zach, but all involved.  Most important lives changed forever. Zach suffers now from a brain stem injury and can not talk, walk or eat, and lives in a nursing home that is strictly geared for the elderly. We are trying to raise funds all the time to help Zach with care that insurance will not pay for, a special vehicle for him, and remodeling our home so when he does come for visits, he is accommodated. We normally have to travel to get him treatments since there is not a Traumatic Brain Injury Rehab Center anywhere near us.  We also have to purchase medical equipment, physical therapy, and supplements for him that insurance will not cover.  When we purchase out of pocket medical equipment, I always look for the floor models or slightly used and demos. We also have to pay for a private room since he is in a nursing home and his severe temperature fluctuations. Our plan is to drive to Arizona this summer, for further treatments.  In the 3 years since Zach's accident he has shown quite a bit of progress, but he will only continue to progress as long as we are able to travel to the places that are equipped to handle a brain injury like he has.  When we travel there, we will have to pay for the treatments, for our stay at the Ronald McDonald house, gas,  Zach's nutrition and all the things he needs on this trip. Please help us meet our goal of $5,000 to get Zach out to Arizona. As any mother would, I search for and pray for a miracle everyday.  These treatments are a necessity for Zach's continued progress and well-being.  WE pray you will join us in our efforts to bring back Zach.

<p>My Uncle Larry has prostate cancer, and it won't be much longer that he'll be with us. I really want to donate some money to cancer research in honor of him, but I frankly am not financially capable. I recently had the idea to shave my head in exchange for donations, so that's what I'm here for! After losing someone very important to me to cancer already, and watching my uncle go through the agony that he's been going through for the past few years, I feel very compelled to try to stop this from happening to other people.</p>
<p><strong>I will be donating all funds raised to the Cancer Research Institute.</strong></p>
<h3>Why May 22?</h3>
<p>My uncle and I share our birthday on May 22. It's been a very special bond for us my whole life, so I think that shaving my head on our shared day would be the perfect day to do this for him. I know that it is a little short notice, but I think it is important.</p>
<h3>What you get:</h3>
<p>On our birthday, May 22, I will shave all of my hair off and record it as a video for the viewing pleasure of anyone who contributed. Eventually, the video will probably be put online, but I will make sure that only the people who made donations or helped me make this happen get to see it first.</p>
<p>Other possible perks to pick from:</p>
<ul>
<li>A personal thank you note from me, mailed to your address. I am a photography student, so it is very likely that I will actually make some special little cards in the darkroom for these. And they might have cats on them.</li>
<li>A copy of the short story ""The Girl With The Hair of Nothing"". <span>My boyfriend will finally be able to use his writing for something other than unemployment to provide you with a short story that he probably hasn't written yet! He's talented, I promise.</span>
</li>
<li><span>A digital print of a portrait of me after my head has been shaved, signed by me. I'm not famous, but this could be a neat reminder of what you helped me do. </span></li>
<li><span>A darkroom print of the aforementioned portrait, also signed by me.</span></li>
<li><span>A streamed video of me fire hooping - after I've shaved my head of course!</span></li>
</ul><p><span>And, last but not least:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The knowledge that you helped contribute to a great cause: cancer research!</span></li>

<h3>Stretch Goals!</h3>
<p><em>If we get to $750, my brother Davison and our friend Sean will shave their heads too!</em></p>

<p><strong>At $1,500, my uncle's wife Cathy will do it!</strong></p>

<p>Good day ladies and gentlemen! My name is Christine L. Castillo, and I am a mother of two teenagers. Most of the people who know me would say that I have a big heart. I enjoy being in the healthcare profession so that I may care for people. I enjoy being a dental assistant in which I can see people literally smile for the work that has helped them in some way.</p>
<p>I have been undergoing some health issues in the past year that has me visiting different physicians. Recently they were able to find a major reason for my declining health. With some modifications to my diet, I am able to control some of the symptoms, but it is still costing for doctors’ visits, medications and supplements. Last year in April, a doctor had indicated that my body does not retain iron and that I would need an iron infusion. I could not afford to have the procedure done, and continued to take iron supplements. In November I was diagnosed with having fibroids in my uterus. So many and in different sizes and that the best solution is to remove the uterus. So far I haven't been out of work, but it is due to medications that allow me function. I believe that by having this surgery that I will be able to eliminate all medications and return to myself.</p>
<p>I believe that this surgery will help me to return to a body that doesn't look 4 months pregnant, and constantly feeling worn down and older than what I am. And I believe that I will be able to not worry if this will hinder my ability to be the provider that I have been for my family.</p>
<p>  The funding for this surgery is what insurance is expecting me to provide out of pocket. This is for the surgeon, the hospital room for 1.5 hours, and the anesthesiologist.</p>
<p>For contributing, the first 4 people will receive an IT WORKS body wrap. This is what I will be able to return to after the surgery is completed and I am released from my physician.</p>

<p>A:  Caroline was in a taxi homeward bound at around 9PM.  It became evident that the driver was drunk as he was speeding &amp; swerving, then he stopped the vehicle and began making obscene, violent remarks to her.

</h3>
<p><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/feenphone-stellar-voice-over-distance-software/x/5769470"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/feenphone-st...</a><br/></p>
<h3>Overview for FeenPhone <br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p>The oldest and most powerful form of human communication is one person speaking to another. Spoken audio, in the form of podcasts, audio books and radio, is the most intimate and direct way to get an idea across.</p>
<p>It's also infinitely portable. People can consume audio-only media while riding a bike, driving
a car or doing other things, which is not possible (or at least not safe) while
consuming video or the printed word. </p>
<p>The Internet has lowered the cost barrier for a worldwide radio
show to a price approaching zero. Yet there is one arena where you still need
thousands of dollars to approach the audio quality of the corporate media:
Doing a live spoken show with more than one host in different geographic
locations. Our program <b>FeenPhone will solve that problem, and it will be given away free. </b></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Why not just use Skype?</h3> <p></p>
<p>Skype isn't truly duplex; when one person speaks, it cuts the other person off. This makes conversations sound unnatural. Even trained radio hosts naturally sometimes talk over each other a little bit, especially at the end of one person speaking and the start of another person speaking. We need software that is duplex so the audience feels like they're in the same room with the people speaking. <br/></p>
<p>Skype, Mumble, TeamSpeak, Blink, etc. all have their uses...general
phone calls or gaming teams. But those VoIP programs are not sufficient for
doing high quality audio in real time over a distance. They're all made for
using crappy mics in noisy locations over varying quality Internet. Therefore,
you'll never get stellar sound from any of them. Plus, they all work through a
central server, which lowers audio quality and increases latency, audio artifacting and drop outs. </p>
<p>The criteria for making audio for podcasting, radio and
remote voiceover are different. We plan to build <b>FeenPhone</b>: a free and open-source program
for podcasters, Internet radio shows, filmmakers, voiceover artists and radio hosts that will meet
our unique needs. We need a peer-to-peer system designed for very low latency, no drop outs and excellent sound when used in a room
with little or no background noise with decent mics over good cable Internet
connections.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A decent mic doesn't cost much. We have done extensive on-air tests of many
microphones and recommend the $50 Audio-Technica AT2005USB.</p>

<p>We will be building FeenPhone with that and similar high-quality, low-price cardioid dynamic USB mics in mind.

<p>I started my show, The Freedom Feens, in 2011 as a podcast. I am now syndicated on 25 commercial radio stations. I had to buy a $1400 piece of broadcast-specific gear to be able to connect to the network before I was able to go live. FeenPhone will replace the need for that type of gear.</p>
<p>FeenPhone could also be used to take calls on a call-in show, with better audio quality than Skype, and with much higher quality than phones.</p>
<p>FeenPhone will be given away free, and the source code will be available free for anyone to use, change or develop as they like.</p>
<p>If you've got something to say to the world, the world can already listen. But if your sound quality is substandard, the world isn't going to listen very long or very often.

Overview for FeenPhone 
 
The oldest and most powerful form of human communication is one person speaking to another. Spoken audio, in the form of podcasts, audio books and radio, is the most intimate and direct way to get an idea across.
It's also infinitely portable. People can consume audio-only media while riding a bike, driving
a car or doing other things, which is not possible (or at least not safe) while
consuming video or the printed word. 
The Internet has lowered the cost barrier for a worldwide radio
show to a price approaching zero. Yet there is one arena where you still need
thousands of dollars to approach the audio quality of the corporate media:
Doing a live spoken show with more than one host in different geographic
locations. Our program FeenPhone will solve that problem, and it will be given away free. 
   Why not just use Skype? 
Skype isn't truly duplex; when one person speaks, it cuts the other person off. This makes conversations sound unnatural. Even trained radio hosts naturally sometimes talk over each other a little bit, especially at the end of one person speaking and the start of another person speaking. We need software that is duplex so the audience feels like they're in the same room with the people speaking. 
Skype, Mumble, TeamSpeak, Blink, etc. all have their uses...general
phone calls or gaming teams. But those VoIP programs are not sufficient for
doing high quality audio in real time over a distance. They're all made for
using crappy mics in noisy locations over varying quality Internet. Therefore,
you'll never get stellar sound from any of them. Plus, they all work through a
central server, which lowers audio quality and increases latency, audio artifacting and drop outs. 
The criteria for making audio for podcasting, radio and
remote voiceover are different. We plan to build FeenPhone: a free and open-source program
for podcasters, Internet radio shows, filmmakers, voiceover artists and radio hosts that will meet
our unique needs. We need a peer-to-peer system designed for very low latency, no drop outs and excellent sound when used in a room
with little or no background noise with decent mics over good cable Internet
connections.

A decent mic doesn't cost much. We have done extensive on-air tests of many
microphones and recommend the $50 Audio-Technica AT2005USB.

 
That mic is loud and clear, has a great pickup pattern for spoken audio, rejects background noise, and even has a tiny bit of built-in compression to reduce peaks and give a smoother sound. It's also plug-and-play so it doesn't require an external USB interface. 
We will be building FeenPhone with that and similar high-quality, low-price cardioid dynamic USB mics in mind. That mic, some blankets hung up to deaden audio reflections, a pair headphones, a cheap streaming server and FeenPhone will enable you to do ultra-high quality live Internet radio shows and podcasts across the miles...Even if your co-host is in a different country. You'll even be able to use FeenPhone to connect to a radio network without additional equipment, should you get syndicated.
We can't believe someone hasn't done this yet. The world needs free and open-source software that does all this.
I started my show, The Freedom Feens, in 2011 as a podcast. I am now syndicated on 25 commercial radio stations. I had to buy a $1400 piece of broadcast-specific gear to be able to connect to the network before I was able to go live. FeenPhone will replace the need for that type of gear.
FeenPhone could also be used to take calls on a call-in show, with better audio quality than Skype, and with much higher quality than phones.
FeenPhone will be given away free, and the source code will be available free for anyone to use, change or develop as they like.

As a young woman with no health insurance, unable to receive any sort of government financial/ medical aid ...it has depleted any savings of hers as well as her parents as well as created a nice pile of debt.

<h2>The Project</h2>
<p>While no head injury should be taken lightly, the real danger is in repeat injuries. Sustaining two or more concussions in a relatively short period of time can be seriously dangerous and has been linked to long term conditions like depression. The only way to effectively prevent these repeat injuries is to have a widely available, easy to use, and highly accurate method of detecting concussions within minutes of sustaining the injury.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To date, there is no effective, portable tool for measuring unusual pupil or oculomotor behavior, and as scientific research finds more links between concussions and long-term brain damage, we saw it to be essential to create a tool with these capabilities. Whether you are a football coach, a teacher, or a parent, a tool to help quickly determine the presence of a concussion can save lives and prevent permanent brain damage.</p>
<p> </p>

Two days later they found out that our beautiful little girl had a bowel obstruction and was taken into exploritory surgery. </p>
<p>The amazing doctors at St. Lukes found that she had an underdeveloped colon due to the obstruction. They reattached the large intestine to the colon in hopes that the colon could develop and all would be well. </p>
<p>A week later, Chloe stopped eating again and was taken into emergency surgery. The underdeveloped colon couldn't handle what was being put through it and tore right below the original reattachment site. They had to do an ileostomy, which is where they bring the large intestine and the colon to the surface and have her use a colostomy bag. We were told she would have to have the bag for at least 6 weeks. Until she was older and more capable of handling another surgury and her colon was large enough to handle its load without fear of another tear.</p>
<p>They told Katie and Cory that she would be able to leave the NICU (Neonatal intensive Care Unit) and come home in the mean time as long as she was eating and growing. Unfortunately, Chloe-Mae has been taking two steps forward and one step back. She has gained weight and enlarged the amount she is eating, only to find out that she isn't absorbing the nutrients she needs. </p>
<p>At this point, Katie and Cory don't know when or if they will be able to take Chloe-Mae home before bringing her back for a third surgury.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, the cost of this terrible situation is weighing heavily on this young couple. Katie, who usually works at the Ada County Courthouse, is applying for temporary disability, but when and if she gets it, it will be only half of her usual pay. Cory, who is a student at BSU, is waiting to be sent out to fight forest fires and is working part time (when they have the work for him) doing construction. </p>
<p>Katie spends her days split up between taking care of her two and a half year old son, learning new medical procedures she will need to know if Chloe is allowed to come home, and trying to give her new daughter as much love as she can before she has to leave for the night.</p>
<p>We, their family, are trying to get the word out there that they need help! This young family has enough strain on them with learning how to take care of Chloe's special needs and wishing every day that they will get to take her home soon. We are hoping that you can find it in your hearts to help them out. </p>
<p>Katie has insurance through her work, but her out of pocket debt is expected to be $3000 in medical bills not to mention the bills that are backing up with the low wages they have coming in. We are just trying to help with the medical expences. We can't make Chloe better for them, but we can help take at least one thing off their plate.</p>

This lot which belongs to the Port Authority of NY&NJ, it is leased to the Hells Kitchen Neighborhood Association and Clinton Housing.  In the early 90's this park was renovated and with a lock and key provided by the Community you were able to volunteer and plant and sit and watch birds hense named ""Bird Park"".
With a great team at Cultivate HKNY they are bringing this park back to life.
The propasal is for a Community Park which other parks in the neighborhood will share the same key which you can purchase at the Community Board.  Tables and Chairs for sitting in the park during busy Midtown Lunch Breaks.  Plants, Flowers and more Greenary overall, Paving Stones with also Donated Pieces of art such as sculptures from local artists will also be placed in this park, including a reading section a bin of books that are also donated.

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">At 29 years old, Brandon has experienced a lot more than his timid, close-lipped smile lets on. Homeless for six years, Brandon felt the cold and shivered; he suffered the hard ground in place of a warm bed; he endured the shame of downward looks and harsh words from passersby. In short, Brandon is no stranger to difficulty.</p>
<p>But he’s also no stranger to hope.   </p>

He cannot enjoy a meal or laugh with a friend without the painful reminder of his rotting teeth. His smile continues to affect his entire life.</p>
