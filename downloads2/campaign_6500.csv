<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS THE FLOATING CINEMA ‘EXTRA-ORDINARY’?</strong></p>
<p>There is something magical about the words <em>Floating </em>and <em>Cinema </em>that really captures people’s imaginations. UP Projects came up with the concept in 2011 and created a very successful pilot project that navigated the canals and rivers of East London temporarily using a converted narrow boat to host on-board and outdoor film screenings to bank side audiences as well as taking people on creative, quirkily hosted tours of the fascinating network of East London’s waterways.</p>
<p>Following the project’s huge success and public demand, we are building a brand new FLOATING CINEMA ‘EXTRA-ORDINARY’, designed by award-winning practice Duggan Morris Architects, which will become a permanent fixture on London’s waterways.</p>
<p>We plan to launch the FLOATING CINEMA ‘EXTRA-ORDINARY’ in June 2013 with a screening and events programme devised by artists Nina Pope and Karen Guthrie (Somewhere).  The FLOATING CINEMA ‘EXTRA-ORDINARY’ will be commissioning new films and performances as well as showcasing new work that would never be seen in mainstream cinemas.</p>
<p><img alt=""watching"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://floatingcinema.info/img/scale/852/568/2011/08/20/6061920602_bee3c464ee_b.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""watching""/></p>
<p>Audiences will be treated to intimate on board screenings  for 15 people, bespoke tours by performers, comedians, writers and cultural commentators, as well as large scale outdoor screenings hosting up to 500 people.  Each tour and event will also be streamed live to an international online audience.</p>
<p>The FLOATING CINEMA ‘EXTRA-ORDINARY’ will visit Islington and Shoreditch, the new Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park as well as the wilds of the Lea Valley and beyond.  It is supported by the Legacy List, a charity established to support the long term cultural, social and physical regeneration of London's Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and aims to breathe new life into the dilapidated canals and backwaters, and add to the cultural life of London’s East End.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>WHO ARE UP PROJECTS?</strong></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.upprojects.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""UP Projects"">UP Projects</a> is a creative non-profit organisation that believes in challenging perceptions of what public art can be, and we are celebrating our tenth anniversary this year.  Operating as a gallery without walls, we are inspired by the complexities of the public realm to create a programme of artists' commissions, projects, strategies and multidisciplinary events for the broadest possible public audience. Our projects always aim to encourage people who may not ordinarily visit museums, galleries or theatres to engage and participate in high quality cultural activity.</p>
<p>We also provide unique opportunities for artists to develop new work in public contexts.</p>
<p>FLOATING CINEMA ‘EXTRA-ORDINARY’ is part of our ongoing ‘Portavilion’ strand of projects, an ambitious programme of artist-led installations for London’s parks, open spaces and more recently the waterways. The project is as much a celebration of the city's most treasured open spaces as it is a cultural event.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>HOW DID THE CONCEPT FOR THE FLOATING CINEMA COME ABOUT?</strong></p>
<p>The canals are the arteries of East London, and have remained a constant in the rapidly changing landscape of an area undergoing significant regeneration. They are the best kept secret of our industrial history and in recent years have been neglected and overlooked. We have been thinking about  how the canals could become an important part of London’s cultural life, and how to bring public attention back to these overlooked, yet enchanting public spaces and use them for a variety of cultural events and activities….thus the Floating Cinema concept was born.</p>
<p><strong><img alt=""by the canal - dawn"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5199/5899965349_40546f9027_z.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""by the canal - dawn""/></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>HOW DO WE KNOW THE IDEA WILL “FLOAT”?</strong></p>
<p>We learned a lot from last year’s pilot project. Not least the level of enthusiasm and demand for such a venture.  Each out door screening gathered audiences of over 300 people, and every on board event could have been booked out ten times over and our website had over 100,000 visitors!  We got really great feedback...</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>HOW DOES IT FIT INTO THE OLYMPIC LEGACY?</strong></p>
<p>FLOATING CINEMA ‘EXTRA-ORDINARY’ will form an important part of the cultural participation programme following the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.  This is being led by the <a href=""http://www.londonlegacy.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""LLDC"">London Legacy Development Corporation</a> (LLDC) and supported by <a href=""http://www.thelegacylist.org.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""The Legacy List"">The Legacy List</a>, an independent charity raising funds to make creative connections between people and the park.  The Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park will reopen in phases, with the first phase which includes the North Park opening to the public on 27 July 2013. We plan to present outdoor screenings and bespoke tours on the site as part of the opening festival.</p>
<p><em>“Post games projects like this will encourage people to think that the Olympic Park is for all of us and that we are going to be here after the games” <br/><strong>Sarah Weir OBE, Chief Executive, The Legacy List</strong></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHO IS DESIGNING THE NEW FLOATING CINEMA?</strong></p>
<p>We ran an international architecture competition earlier this year and together with a formidable panel of judges (including Lady Patty Hopkins, representatives from the London Legacy Development Coroporation, the Legacy List and the <a href=""http://www.architecturefoundation.org.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Architecture Foundation</a>) we selected the winning design by <a href=""http://www.dugganmorrisarchitects.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Duggan Morris Architects"">Duggan Morris Architects</a>. We felt their proposal for “A Strange Cargo of Extra-Ordinary Objects” presented a robust and practical, as well as highly inventive and imaginative, response to the brief.</p>
<p><strong><img alt=""sketch 1"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.upprojects.com/images/cms/Image/DMA%20Floating%20Cinema%20Line%20Perspective_300dpi.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;"" title=""sketch 1""/></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Duggan Morris Architects have been established for 8 years, during which time they have received several RIBA Awards and the prestigious Manser Medal. 2012 represents a transitional phase for the practice, moving into a number of new sectors including higher education, public and arts based projects, conservation and renovation as well as continuing successful work in private housing, public housing and regeneration and commercial sector projects.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>WHAT WILL THE FLOATING CINEMA ‘EXTRA-ORDINARY’ BE LIKE?</strong></p>
<p>Duggan Morris Architects’ designs incorporate an auditorium/cabin that will seat up to 15 people. This intimate scale is perfect for group tour or screening, while also still nimble enough for us to navigate the intricacies of the UK canal network, and squeeze under the smallest bridge or through the narrowest lock.</p>
<p><img alt=""at night"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.upprojects.com/images/cms/Image/DMA%20Floating%20Cinema%20outside%20White%20Building_300dpi.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin: 1px 8px; float: right;"" title=""at night""/></p>
<p>It will also boast a café/ticket office, an outdoor “public square” / foyer and accommodation for our skipper.  The new design also features a periscopic projector that will be able to project a moving image onto the water, the inside of tunnels or adjacent buildings, and will incorporate a web cam, GPS tracking system and a clever piece of kit that will enable us stream all our events live to an on line audience. So wherever you are, you’ll be able to get involved with the FLOATING CINEMA ‘EXTRA-ORDINARY’ experience!</p>
<p>All events will be open to the public.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>WHERE WILL IT MOORED AND HOW LONG WILL IT STAY THERE?</strong></p>
<p>We are planning to moor the cinema near to the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, but we will be moving all over the waterways during the summer, and hope to remain a highly visible feature for many years to come.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>HOW WILL WE USE THE MONEY?</strong></p>
<p>This is our ballpark project breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boat hull - $USD 24,300 / £GBP 15,000</li>
<li>Cinema auditorium - $USD 40,700 / £GBP 25,200</li>
<li>Skipper’s quarters - $USD 20,600 / £ 12,800</li>
<li>Technical equipment - $USD 27,400 / £GBP 17,000</li>
<li>Boat kit - $USD 5,000 / £GBP 3,000</li>
</ul><p>TOTAL - $USD 118,000 / £GBP 73,000</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHO IS ALREADY ON BOARD WITH FUNDING?</strong></p>
<p>Floating Cinema 2013 has been majority funded by the Legacy List through its corporate partnerships with <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Bloomberg LP"">Bloomberg LP</a> and the <a href=""http://canalrivertrust.org.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Canal and River Trust"">Canal and River Trust</a>.  $USD 100,000 or 85% of total required funds have been secured to date, but we need an extra 15% or $USD 18,000 to make the project happen.</p>

A Public Art project that will animate the canals and rivers of East London, United Kingdom.
The FLOATING CINEMA ‘EXTRA-ORDINARY’ will bring outdoor film screenings, performative tours and live events to London’s canals;  re-animating the waterways and breathing new life into the East End of London.

<h3>Sky Light</h3>
<p>Hi - I'm Chrispy!</p>
<p>Sky Light is my first piece of LED art - it has been a tremendous journey to get to where we are right now. A lot of work has already been done.</p>
<p>With the help of a ton of really amazing volunteers, we built the first version of Sky Light and displayed it at Soak, the Oregon regional burn, earlier this year. Now it's time to push forward and finish the piece - make it weather proof, and make it interactive.</p>
<p>I'm really excited to see this piece continue to evolve - thank you so much for your help!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>So what are you working on exactly?</h3>
<p>Sky Light is an LED art piece.</p>
<p>Right now it consists of 61 acrylic boxes that contain about 1000 LEDs. And it's not yet interactive.</p>
<p>We want to add another 42 boxes, finish the geometric shape of the piece, and add another 1500 LEDs. This is going to require a retrofit of the wiring of the piece, more power supplies, more LEDs, and a lot of work.</p>

<h3>
<br/>The Project<br/><br/>
</h3>
<p>My name is Ava Porter and I am an MFA candidate in Visual Arts at UCSD.  One year ago my partner, Farhad Akhmetov, and I set out to make a sculpture, <i>The Wrestlers,</i> generated entirely from real-time motion.  The idea was to use contemporary cinematic technologies such as 3D scanning and motion capture to digitally acquire the movement of two Brazilian Jiu Jitsu wrestlers as they sparred. Once acquired, this movement could be ""crystallized"" into a single form (or frame as in the motion blur captured by a photograph) and carved into real space by a CNC machine.  This frozen motion would then be cast in translucent polyurethane-based resin, to produce a life-size sculpture reminiscent of the 20th century Cubist and Futurist attempts to convey the passage of time within a single object, yet no longer representational and instead wholly objective.<br/><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1177678/files/20150127114656-uniqueforms.jpg?1422388016"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This work, in addition to a series of videos and photographs, will constitute my thesis at UCSD.  The exhibition will be free and open to the public, with a closing party on June 12, 2015.  </p>
<p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What We Need </h3>

Jitsu often looks more like a tender embrace than an explosive
attack.  Positions typically considered
submissive or female in mainstream society become the most powerful positions
in a Jiu Jitsu ring.  For example, “full
guard,” Brazilian Jiu Jitsu’s primary position, entails a fighter wrapping his
legs around the waist of his opponent to pull him close.  Although this is a move to gain control of an opponent, this move can be seen, not only an expression of violence, but also as one of intimacy.  <br/><br/></p>

</div></div>","The Project

My name is Ava Porter and I am an MFA candidate in Visual Arts at UCSD.  One year ago my partner, Farhad Akhmetov, and I set out to make a sculpture, The Wrestlers, generated entirely from real-time motion.  The idea was to use contemporary cinematic technologies such as 3D scanning and motion capture to digitally acquire the movement of two Brazilian Jiu Jitsu wrestlers as they sparred. Once acquired, this movement could be ""crystallized"" into a single form (or frame as in the motion blur captured by a photograph) and carved into real space by a CNC machine.  This frozen motion would then be cast in translucent polyurethane-based resin, to produce a life-size sculpture reminiscent of the 20th century Cubist and Futurist attempts to convey the passage of time within a single object, yet no longer representational and instead wholly objective.



This work, in addition to a series of videos and photographs, will constitute my thesis at UCSD.  The exhibition will be free and open to the public, with a closing party on June 12, 2015.  


What We Need 
We have made huge progress with the implementation of this highly innovative project due to generous in-kind support.  xxArray has produced the 3D scans and Xsens 
3D Motion Capture Company has performed the motion capture.  UCSD has provided studio space and production equipment and will also provide the CNC milling machine when the time comes to carve.  Rey Diogo Brazilian Jiu Jitsu has provided practice and production space.  UCSD and UCIRA have provided a number of small grants for preliminary costs.  The values of these services and equipment total over $50,000. 



However, we still need an additional $8,000 in cash for the cost of materials and labor in the project's final stages.
BUDGET BREAKDOWN:$1,500 for the cost of high-density foam (to be carved).$2,000 for the cost of polyurethane resin.$1,000 for the cost of mold-making materials.$2,000 for a rigger/Maya specialist.$1,000 for a sculpture fabricator.$500 for installation costs and miscellaneous expendables.

    The Impact 
Visually complex, and full of contradictions, Brazilian Jiu

present wrestling, not as the ego-driven sport of mainstream cinema, but as an

Since we are fully funded for our campaign, but still have 20 days left on our Indiegogo campaign, we decided that we'd really like to up our fundraising another $1,250 in order to buy a full-size letterpress for SAFTA. We were going to do a campaign this winter, but we're only $925 away from that goal now!

Please consider giving to help us on this endeavor!
 
 
 
Short Summary
 
The brainchild of Sundress Publications, a registered non-profit, The Sundress Academy for the Arts (SAFTA) was founded in February 2013 at Firefly Farms in Karns, Tennessee. Nestled in an old-fashioned ""holler"" just twenty minutes from downtown Knoxville, this picturesque 29-acre farm is the perfect artists' getaway; visitors can hone their creative crafts as they escape the routine of modern life. Whether you're hiking, camping, foraging, or hunting, you will reconnect with nature and be inspired by a part of the Appalachia landscape that is often forgotten. SAFTA attendees can also expect to learn a host of new skills from the staff to enrich their work.
 
In order to help fund this enormous project, we plan to host livestock, including self-pastured horses, a small herd of goats and sheep to ""mow"" the pastures and control wild growth, and chickens to produce eggs for egg dishes galore! To get started, we must finish mending the fences along the property, buy and install gates, build shelter for the horses, and acquire the animals themselves.
 
What We Need & What You Get
Our goal is to raise $1,500, which will cover eco-friendly solar fencing (approximately $200 for the solar charger and another $150 for the actual fencing), five gates of varying sizes (approximately $100 apiece), wood for the construction of horse shelters (approximately $400), plus five sheep, five goats (both animals $50-$100 apiece), and ten to twelve chickens ($8 apiece). All animals will be cage-free and pasture-grazed in an idyllic country environment!
 
By giving to this campaign, you will not only support small farming in the United States, but also make a huge investment in SAFTA’s future. Donors who contribute at least $10 will receive awesome Sundress Publications swag, and all donors who give over $100 will qualify for discounts on SAFTA workshops and residencies, as well as other fun and creative perks.  
 
Donors who give $200-$499 will receive a one-year Urania level membership for SAFTA & Sundress Publications, which includes one free SAFTA day workshop plus 33% off all other workshops during that year, 33% off all Sundress titles, free entry into one Sundress Publications contest, and a free broadside of your choice.  Donors who give $500 and over will receive a Terpsichore level membership, which will give you seven free SAFTA day workshops per year, 50% off all Sundress titles, free entry into any Sundress Publications contest, and a SAFTA t-shirt and shot glass.
 
All donors will receive a link to our ATV tour of Firefly Farms taken at perilously unsafe speeds!  (It's a thrilling three minutes.)
 
Should we manage to raise money above and beyond our goal, we will direct funds toward other projects, such as reconstructing barns, building a stage for our Theater in the Woods, and erecting residency cabins at the top of the hill. 
 
The Impact
We have been stunned by the investment of physical labor and determination by the Knoxville literary and arts community since our founding in February. In just four short months, we have gutted the farmhouse and nearly completed an extensive rewiring of the entire building. We have put new floors in two of the rooms and dug a drainage trench to divert rainwater and runoff. We have also cleared nearly three acres of pastureland for this project, all of which was deeply wooded with five-to-seven years’ worth of young-growth trees and brush.
 
This would not have been possible without the support of Knoxville's writers and artists, whose faith in this project, not to mention their willingness to donate precious time and energy, has demonstrated the clear desire for a space such as this. Still, we need your help, too. By giving to SAFTA, you will help us continue to move rapidly forward and achieve our goal of opening for artist residencies in Fall 2013.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Fantasmata was conceived in 2015 as a collaboration between flautist Klio Blonz, actress and director Amanda Douge and poet and filmmaker Pye Ciardha. All three artists work at a high level in their artistic disciplines.  Following a successful workshop performance at The Peckham Festival the team has also been joined by sculptor Laurence Louisfert.  We now need to raise initial productions funds to make our first season possible. The vision for Fantasmata is that return seasons are performed twice yearly in London.  At its heart this project is an evocation to a transformed and more connected world. </p>

</div><p> </p></div>","Short Summary
Fantasmata was conceived in 2015 as a collaboration between flautist Klio Blonz, actress and director Amanda Douge and poet and filmmaker Pye Ciardha. All three artists work at a high level in their artistic disciplines.  Following a successful workshop performance at The Peckham Festival the team has also been joined by sculptor Laurence Louisfert.  We now need to raise initial productions funds to make our first season possible. The vision for Fantasmata is that return seasons are performed twice yearly in London.  At its heart this project is an evocation to a transformed and more connected world. 

What We Need & What You Get

We need to raise £3000 for Asylum space rental, screen and projector hire, and PA system
We have perks from social media credits, opening night tix, CD recordings through to associate producer credits available
If we do not reach our funding goal the funds will still go towards the production. 


The Impact
Feedback from the workshop performance: ""This is a very beautiful multimedia performance.I was privileged to attend a ""work in progress"" performance of it last year and found it really magical"", ""Packs quite a punch"", ""Wonderous, haunting, sublime and disorientating"", ""The poetry is beautiful and astounding."" 

Risks & Challenges

We will continue to seek sources of assistance until we can get the first season up. 
The largest risk is that the April season will have to be changed to a later date to allow for further fund raising. 


Other Ways You Can Help

Please help spread the word by social media and with your face to face networks

<h3>About The Fest</h3>
<p>SHEER QUEER Fest seeks to reclaim space in music to promote and center the voices of angry queers, furious trans folks, and other rowdy gayz.</p>
<p>Last year we raised over $1,200 for Youth on Fire, a youth drop in center that works with queer youth without homes, assisting in their ability to remain open during the winter. (They have since over turned some of the budget cuts from the state and are no longer at risk of closing!) This year we are working with SWOP-Boston (Sex Worker Outreach Program) to do our part to support people in our community who have been dealing with the fallout of the passing of SESTA/FOSTA.</p>
<p>The dates for the fest are set for <strong>September 21st, 22nd, and 23rd</strong>. Friday and Saturday will be at Hardcore Stadium (<i>55 Bishop Allen Rd Cambridge, MA</i>). Sunday will be at Once Somerville (<i>156 Highland Ave. Somerville, MA</i>) In addition to the bands and performers we've confirmed with, The Boston League of Wicked Wrestlers (BLOWW) will be bringing the pain for our half time beatdown of live wrestling matches on Saturday!</p>
<p>Sheer Queer Fest stands in solidarity with all marginalized communities and aims to combat racism, sexism, homo/transphobia, and other harmful behaviors present in radical spaces. Oppressive behavior will not be tolerated at the fest. BROS, FASCISTS, AND NAZIS FUCK OFF!<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What The Funds Go Towards</h3>
<p>All the funds raised from this campaign will go directly to helping the bands travel to Boston for the fest and cover any space rental fee's for the venues. We have been doing a bunch of benefits leading up to the fest but there are still expenses that need to be covered. Due to the size of the fest, we had few options for spaces and they have much higher room fees than we originally anticipated. This is your opportunity to ensure that the fest is able to accommodate everyone and go off without issue!<br/> </p>
<h3>This Year's Perks</h3>
<p>Last year we only had a shirt. This year we've got way more in the works so be sure to check out all of them as well as our combo deals for all the merch!</p>

<h2>Publicly Accessible &amp; Affordable</h2>
<p>The letterpress printing facilities will be available to the public for rates that artists, designers, printers, crafters and makers can afford. $30 annual membership (includes access to cooperative studio including screenprinting facilities) and $5/hr studio time.<br/><br/>Inks, consumables, stocks, plates &amp; dies will be offered with Olio's current non-profit rates.<br/><br/><br/></p>

<h3><strong>About Skipping Stones Theatre</strong></h3>
<p>We are an independent theatre collective, formed by artists who started in the same place, but began hopping to new ones to learn and explore. We're based in the Greater Toronto Area, but have an international perspective, acquired through study in North America, Europe, and Asia.</p>
<p>Art commonly offers insight to someone else's experience, but in rare moments, art will allow us to better understand ourselves. We could all use a bit of help with understanding who we are - the most important step towards becoming the best version of ourselves. </p>
<p>Skipping Stones Theatre focuses on plays or interpretations of plays through the lens of mental health.</p>

<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>This project is ambitious and our budget is based on a profit-share model. By contributing to the physical costs of the production you will allow us to financially support our independent artists. We make a concerted effort to keep our production costs low through the classic tactic of ""Reduce Reuse Recycle"" to maximize the pay out to our artists.</p>
<p><strong>Why $700?</strong></p>
<p>As a company, we have two goals:</p>
<p>1) To tell our stories with integrity.</p>
<p>2) To PAY our artists.</p>
<p>Our Indiegogo campaign will contribute to sets, costumes, props, administrative costs and marketing. The more of these physical costs we can cover before ticket sales, the more able we are to provide our artists with a respectable salary. Our goal for our crowdfunding campaign is only looking to cover the base physical costs of the production. We have been hustling with other fundraising avenues to cover the rest. Below is a more specified breakdown of where our crowdfunding campaign will be going:</p>
<p>Props: $100</p>
<p>Costumes: $150</p>
<p>Set: $100</p>
<p>Promotional materials: $100</p>
<p>Photographer/Multimedia: $150</p>
<p>Technician: $100</p>

<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>

We will do everything we can artistically to earn your support, but as we are not above bribery, check out our <strong>YUMMY PERKS</strong> 'cause they're wicked awesome.</p>
<p>Want to further help us out? Spread the word:  Either by word of mouth and/or social media. You can share our crowdfunding page via Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. We'll love you for it!</p>

<h3>What we are</h3>
<p>SackReligious is an evolving family endeavor that reflects our love of differences and diversity. A way to elevate subcultures and maybe be a little snarky in the process. Because the truth is, we're a little stressed. A lot. And we don't just want to survive, we want to make a difference. It matters to us. A lot matters to us. A lot. Our worldview is that of inclusion, respect, support, and compassion. We celebrate differences and realize we all want the same things. Love, tolerance, acceptance, freedom. In our family unit we represent a few subcultures and feel strongly that even so we come from a place of privilege and want to use that for the advancement of human kindness and connection.</p>
<p>There's no better way to spread that message than with art, and even better art you carry with you. And so SackReligious is born! Counterculture art you wear and use. Specifically, well, sacks! Bags! For carrying stuff and making a statement.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Making a big debut!</h3>
<p>May 31st - June 3rd is <a href=""http://www.hearseclub.com/hearsecon/hearsecon.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HearseCon 2018</a>, we have a table reserved for their Morbid Curiosities Expo on June 2nd and this will be SackReligious first physical debut and we need your help to make it a success.</p>
<p>Our $750 goal is enough money to get us the 2 big pieces of equipment we need to get or little bag making enterprise underway! We need a vinyl cutter and a heat press to make our bags a reality. 5% of all our raised funds will be donated to <a href=""https://us.ditchthelabel.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ditch the Label</a>, more on them in a minute. Beyond that the rest of the funds will cover IndieGoGo's 5% platform fee, materials for making the bags and offset travel costs to HearseCon.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What it means to us</h3>
<p>It's a family dream to run our own business that makes a difference in the world. SackReligious is the culmination of years of just thinking about it, and we're here to make it real. We are but a few punk, goth, geek, nerd, hippie, rebels, our reach is small but our hopes are ENORMOUS. So when we set out to make this happen we wanted to find a charity who's views matched our own. Enter <a href=""https://us.ditchthelabel.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ditch the Label</a>, whose aesthetic and underlying beliefs perfectly mirror our own. So when you contribute to this project you won't only be helping a family realize one of their dreams, you'll also be supporting a worthy cause.</p>
<h3>The goods!</h3>
<p>What's in it for you? A really cool bag of your choice! We have thirteen designs to choose from, with more on the way if we get enough support. There are 2 bag styles you can choose from, a mid-size grocery tote or a drawstring backpack, both are 100% cotton high-quality bags. And only for our IndieGoGo backers, you have the choice of 5 different colors, when we sell these bags in the future designs will come in specific colors! There are 2 tiers for each bag, just the bag or the bag plus a pair of one of our earring designs! If you want more than one bag you can make one contribution for a bag then come back and make a second (or third!) contribution to get a different design. All the designs and options are detailed below.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Truthfully we've never made bags with designs on them before, but that shouldn't scare you! We are a family of artists with a combined 10 years experience in manufacturing and product fulfillment. We're a bunch of smart cookies, we're capable of anything we set our minds to. So our biggest challenge is simply getting the right tools for the job, and that's why you're here!</p>

</div></div>","What we are
SackReligious is an evolving family endeavor that reflects our love of differences and diversity. A way to elevate subcultures and maybe be a little snarky in the process. Because the truth is, we're a little stressed. A lot. And we don't just want to survive, we want to make a difference. It matters to us. A lot matters to us. A lot. Our worldview is that of inclusion, respect, support, and compassion. We celebrate differences and realize we all want the same things. Love, tolerance, acceptance, freedom. In our family unit we represent a few subcultures and feel strongly that even so we come from a place of privilege and want to use that for the advancement of human kindness and connection.
There's no better way to spread that message than with art, and even better art you carry with you. And so SackReligious is born! Counterculture art you wear and use. Specifically, well, sacks! Bags! For carrying stuff and making a statement.

Making a big debut!
May 31st - June 3rd is HearseCon 2018, we have a table reserved for their Morbid Curiosities Expo on June 2nd and this will be SackReligious first physical debut and we need your help to make it a success.
Our $750 goal is enough money to get us the 2 big pieces of equipment we need to get or little bag making enterprise underway! We need a vinyl cutter and a heat press to make our bags a reality. 5% of all our raised funds will be donated to Ditch the Label, more on them in a minute. Beyond that the rest of the funds will cover IndieGoGo's 5% platform fee, materials for making the bags and offset travel costs to HearseCon.

What it means to us
It's a family dream to run our own business that makes a difference in the world. SackReligious is the culmination of years of just thinking about it, and we're here to make it real. We are but a few punk, goth, geek, nerd, hippie, rebels, our reach is small but our hopes are ENORMOUS. So when we set out to make this happen we wanted to find a charity who's views matched our own. Enter Ditch the Label, whose aesthetic and underlying beliefs perfectly mirror our own. So when you contribute to this project you won't only be helping a family realize one of their dreams, you'll also be supporting a worthy cause.
The goods!
What's in it for you? A really cool bag of your choice! We have thirteen designs to choose from, with more on the way if we get enough support. There are 2 bag styles you can choose from, a mid-size grocery tote or a drawstring backpack, both are 100% cotton high-quality bags. And only for our IndieGoGo backers, you have the choice of 5 different colors, when we sell these bags in the future designs will come in specific colors! There are 2 tiers for each bag, just the bag or the bag plus a pair of one of our earring designs! If you want more than one bag you can make one contribution for a bag then come back and make a second (or third!) contribution to get a different design. All the designs and options are detailed below.
















Risks & Challenges
Truthfully we've never made bags with designs on them before, but that shouldn't scare you! We are a family of artists with a combined 10 years experience in manufacturing and product fulfillment. We're a bunch of smart cookies, we're capable of anything we set our minds to. So our biggest challenge is simply getting the right tools for the job, and that's why you're here!

<h2>Breve Resumen</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>¿Quiénes somos? </h3>
<p>Para realizar el proyecto <i><strong>Cabo Manglares -una posibilidad de encuentro</strong></i>, hemos conformado un equipo de trabajo de tres artistas y aventureros colombianos apasionados por la naturaleza: </p>
<p><strong>Juan Camilo Franco:</strong> artista visual con amplia experiencia en realización de proyectos audiovisuales, multimedia e interactivos.</p>
<p><strong>León Felipe Jiménez:</strong> artista plástico, audiovisual y biólogo en formación con experiencia en proyectos de arte y naturaleza.</p>
<p><strong>Juan Sebastián Ulloa:</strong> ingeniero de sonido y doctor en ecología. Estudia la diversidad acústica del bosque tropical a través de paisajes sonoros.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>¿Qué esperamos con su apoyo?</h3>
<p>Creemos que esta campaña logrará llamar su atención ya que el proyecto artístico que planteamos es único en el marco de la <strong>Primera Expedición Científica al Pacífico Colombiano </strong>que se realizará a finales de noviembre en <strong>Cabo Manglares</strong> al sur occidente de <strong>Colombia </strong>en el departamento de <strong>Nariño.</strong> Si se identifica con los proyectos artísticos , colaborativos, interdisciplinares y enfocados en la naturaleza y los viajes de aventura, queremos que haga parte de este proceso. </p>
<p>¡Lo invitamos a que apoye nuestra campaña! </p>
<p>Estamos buscando su apoyo para las fases de <strong>pre y post-producción</strong> de este proyecto que consiste en la realización de una publicación digital (<strong>ePUB</strong>) a partir del material registrado en la expedición. La fase de producción, que consiste en registrar en fotografía, video y audio, se llevará a cabo en medio de la expedición, para lo cual contaremos con todo el apoyo de la <strong>Comisión Colombiana del Océano, </strong>la <strong>Armada Nacional de Colombia, </strong>la<strong> Dirección General Marítima </strong>(entre otras importantes instituciones),<strong> </strong> quienes estarán a cargo de todo el tema de organización general, logístico y de seguridad (<i><a href=""http://www.cco.gov.co/expedicion-cientifica-al-pacifico.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.cco.gov.co/expedicion-cientifica-al-pacifico.html</a></i>). Nuestro proyecto fue seleccionado por convocatoria.</p>
<p>En este momento estamos en la etapa de <strong>pre-producción</strong>, en donde buscamos apoyo para poder viajar a Tumaco (Departamento de Nariño), ciudad desde la que zarpará el buque de la expedición. El apoyo también va encaminado a la fase de <strong>post-producción</strong>, en la que luego de la expedición estaremos haciendo una curaduría del material registrado para luego desarrollar la <strong>publicación digital</strong>. Para nosotros es una gran oportunidad poder estar en esta expedición compartiendo conocimiento con la comunidad científica y  crear un contenido con una mirada estética de <strong>Cabo Manglares </strong>en el marco de la<strong> Primera Expedición Científica al Pacífico Colombiano</strong>. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>¿Qué necesitamos y qué recibirá a cambio por su apoyo?</h3>
<p>Queremos recaudar 2.000 USD. Estos recursos serán destinados como explicamos a continuación:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong> Etapa de pre-producción:</strong> recursos para tiquetes aéreos ida y vuelta  desde nuestro lugar de origen hasta Tumaco en el departamento de Nariño, al sur occidente de Colombia. También  viáticos, que incluyen alimentación y hospedaje para 2 días en Tumaco.  </li>
<li>
<strong>Etapa de post-producción:</strong> recursos para parte de los  honorarios por labores de <strong>diagramación, diseño interactivo y finalización de la publicación digital</strong>. Esto se realizará durante los tres meses siguientes a la expedición. La publicación estará disponible para descarga gratuita a finales de marzo de 2019.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Hemos creado una serie de recompensas relacionadas con los temas de la expedición para que ustedes se sientan parte de este proyecto al decidir apoyarnos. Entre las recompensas tenemos: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Piezas exclusivas en cerámica</strong>, diseñadas por <i><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/MisspexCeramics/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Misspex Ceramics</a></i><strong><i>,</i></strong> artista bogotana. Estas tendrán motivos de animales autóctonos de esta zona de manglares en el océano pacífico.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fotografías</strong> exclusivas tomadas por nosotros en Cabo Manglares, impresas a full resolución, ampliadas a 60 x 40 cm y montadas en retablo.</li>
<li>
<strong>Nuestros servicios de producción audiovisual</strong> para la realización de videos<strong> </strong>de 2 minutos de duración cada uno,  sobre el tema que usted elija (incluyendo grabación, edición y post-producción).</li>
</ul>
<p>Esperamos alcanzar a recaudar la totalidad del dinero, si no es así lo que se alcance a recaudar será destinado igualmente al proyecto. Nos aseguraremos de que las recompensas lo dejen complacido.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Help me create an awesome Creature from the Black Lagoon handcrafted high fire ceramic coffee mug version 2.0. It'll have the hand sculpted nameplate, bigger handle and better Creature transition to the mug. I'm thinking it'll look like he's busting through the mug.</p>

<p>[This hand sculpted Creature nameplate will be on the back (drinking side) of the mug.]</p>
<ul>
<li>My name is Mike Fleming Jr - I'm 31 years old and I'm an independent artist from Colorado. I sculpted, molded, cast, painted, fired and glazed everything here and will for each perk.</li>
<li>This campaign is important to me because it helps me create cool art for people to enjoy that they can actually use every day! That's very cool. It will also allow me build trust with you! If you decide to support my art I want you to be confident knowing that I will deliver on this project and on future projects. That's of paramount importance to me.</li>
<li>You will be helping me create really cool sculpted, ultra detailed coffee mugs and expand on ideas I want to implement in future ceramic and artistic works.</li>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>I'm asking for one thousand dollars to help me create these mugs. This will help pay for the materials I need to create them. If the goal amount is raised it will also help me get an art table at a local convention in the fall. I would like to attend more conventions and this campaign will hopefully help me do that.</li>
<li>I have some very neat perks for you all. I have stickers, DIY resin Creature heads as well as soap! There's hand painted resin heads and of course the coffee mug itself! Maybe even a few more surprises.</li>
<li>If I don't make the goal the money raised will go to just getting the materials to fulfill the campaign orders and pay the fees.</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>I'd like the impact to be about coming together to create cool art and support an artist that creates the art that I hope you will value for life.  </li>
<li>I have helped out several friends on their successful fundraising attempts using my artwork to help fund their campaigns. Mostly with my mini figurines. </li>
<li>The truth is that I need your help to keep me creating art. I want you to be able to trust me and join the team. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>I have developed several versions of my ceramic mugs each featuring a different head sculpture of mine. In creating these mugs I have discovered how to retain the detail of my sculpts despite the undercut and complexity of some of the heads. I've also figured out some of the best ways to apply the glazes and get complex glaze color options to look really nice when they are fired.</li>
<li>I started creating these coffee mugs to help navigate the complex field of ceramics and forge a path that I could find confidence in while keeping my goals on each piece intact. I know what I can now accomplish on these mugs and now I want to expand on that knowledge and push the quality and speed forward.</li>
<li>You can be assured that you will receive whatever perk you help fund at. Nothing digital here. You will get something physical in the mail from me and it will happen soon. I have full confidence in saying that. </li>

<h3>What is The Nautilus and the Ammonite? <br/> </h3>
<p><i>The nautilus and the ammonite<br/>        Were launched in friendly strife,<br/>Each sent to float in its tiny boat<br/>       On the wide, wide sea of life.</i></p>
<p>The Nautilus and the Ammonite is my latest book project. It features an anonymous poem that I simply fell in love with. The poem dates back to the 1800’s, an era when the science of paleontology was still taking its first steps. Its narrative follows two ancient mollusks, friends who together witness the last days of the Cretaceous, and one - the Ammonite - who is lost in the same event that took the dinosaurs.<br/><br/>This book is unique in that it juxtaposes old fashioned poetic language with contemporary visual art. The result is a volume that explores scientific questions about our world while contemplating philosophical implications in a way that is as emotionally responsive as it is brainy. <br/><br/>I began the artwork for this book while completing an artist residency at Sunny Point on Lake Keuka in the fall of 2015. Work continued in my Philadelphia studio and was finally completed last May during another artist residency at Soaring Gardens Artist Retreat. With this project, I aimed to do something new and expand beyond just woodcut prints. In addition to woodblock prints, the imagery includes linocut, collograph, and screenprints, as well as painting, drawing, and collage.

<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>This campaign seeks to raise $4,000 to cover printing and binding of a first edition of 500 books. By printing a sizable first edition (opposed to doing print-on-demand) I can keep the retail prices of my books competitive with most commercial publishing houses and affordable for a broader audience. To put it another way, I can produce a high quality book that sells for $20, opposed to $40. and thereby get this small treasure into more peoples' hands and hearts. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>
<br/>What You Get</h3>
<p>First and foremost, all who pre-order books through this campaign will receive signed copies and a personal thank you card from me before the books go on sale to a general audience. The books will be 32 pages, hardcover with full-color off-set printing. I'm going with Signature Book Printing - the same company that printed my last book ""Owl and Cat In Love"" - because they do a top-notch job. <br/><br/>For those who want to go above and beyond supporting this campaign, I'm offering some awesome extras:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limited edition wood engravings, 5"" x 7.5"" of Nautilus and Ammonite. Oil-based black ink printed on fawn-colored Stonehenge paper </li>
<li>Hand-pulled, 15"" x 22"" woodblock prints of the Tyrannosaurus Rex from the book, printed in red ink on fawn-colored Stonehenge paper</li>
<li>Hand-pulled, 22"" x 15"" woodblock prints of the Stegosaurus from the book, printed in green ink on fawn-colored Stonehenge paper</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Part of the inspiration for this book was a course I took on mass extinctions through the Wagner Free Institute for Science where I work as a teaching artist-in-residence. The K-T event that ended the dinosaurs' rule on earth was only one of 5 major extinctions. Today, many scientists are sounding the alarm that we are in the midst of a sixth mass extinction caused by human activities. Life and its surrounding conditions on earth have always been in flux. We are wise to learn as much as we can and care about both the history and present nature of these changes. Facts and figures are essential to our understanding, but we must also be emotionally engaged. Children and adults alike know and care about dinosaurs because they are inherently fascinating creatures in their size and appearance. Ammonites are far more modest in their appeal. Millions of years ago, they, like dinosaurs, were abundant, and now they are gone. It is my hope that this poem and artwork spark curiosity in its readers about the more downplayed mysteries, tragedies, and wonders to be found in the story of life on earth. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I am no stranger to crowdfunding. Three years ago I founded Words On Woodcuts Press with an Indiegogo fundraising campaign that raised nearly $4,000 (198% of its original goal.) In less than a year I collected the seed funds to publish my first two books (each in editions of 500) through successful pre-sale campaigns and crowd-sourced small business loans (loans now paid back in full - woo hoo!) Last year I ran two successful pre-sale campaigns, creating an edition of 100 handmade ""Wise Old Owl"" books as well as a ""12 Owls"" calendar and coloring book. I know fundraising is a lot of work, but also a lot of fun.</p>
<p>I'm so grateful to all the family, friends, colleagues, and collectors of my work who have supported all my past endeavors and given me the confidence to not only maintain my studio practice, but also get my work out to a broader audience. Thank you, all!</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Maybe a picture book about a nautilus and ammonite during the Cretaceous isn't something you want to buy, but you still want to support Words On Woodcuts Press and my art studio. In that case: </p>

</div></div>","What is The Nautilus and the Ammonite?  
The nautilus and the ammonite        Were launched in friendly strife,Each sent to float in its tiny boat       On the wide, wide sea of life.
The Nautilus and the Ammonite is my latest book project. It features an anonymous poem that I simply fell in love with. The poem dates back to the 1800’s, an era when the science of paleontology was still taking its first steps. Its narrative follows two ancient mollusks, friends who together witness the last days of the Cretaceous, and one - the Ammonite - who is lost in the same event that took the dinosaurs.This book is unique in that it juxtaposes old fashioned poetic language with contemporary visual art. The result is a volume that explores scientific questions about our world while contemplating philosophical implications in a way that is as emotionally responsive as it is brainy. I began the artwork for this book while completing an artist residency at Sunny Point on Lake Keuka in the fall of 2015. Work continued in my Philadelphia studio and was finally completed last May during another artist residency at Soaring Gardens Artist Retreat. With this project, I aimed to do something new and expand beyond just woodcut prints. In addition to woodblock prints, the imagery includes linocut, collograph, and screenprints, as well as painting, drawing, and collage. Readers are meant to imaginatively experience a bygone world that we can never fully know because our understanding is based only on collected fossils and fragments. I’ve chosen to depict both the Nautilus and Ammonite in ways that humanize them and hopefully make them more accessible to readers of all ages.

<p><i>Witnesses is a <strong>non-profit, itinerant photographic project </strong>consisting of 11 portraits of inhabitants of San Pablito Pahuatlán (Puebla, Mexico). Each portrait represents a stage of the human life cycle: from childhood to old age. It is accompanied by a second exhibition called San Pablito with 56 pictures documenting the life of this community that produces amate paper. </i></p>
<p><i><strong>The goal is to create,</strong> on the one hand, a tribute to indigenous people in general wherever they are and to encourage awareness of the ecological, social and cultural challenges most communities like San Pablito confront.  And, on the other, for the exhibit to travel the world; so far, the show has been confirmed in two museums.</i></p>

<p>Within the framework of the UN’s observance of 2019 as the <strong>International Year of Indigenous Languages</strong> and that 2021 will commemorate 500 years of the “conquest” of Latin America, this campaign comprises the production of a project with two exhibits: <i>Witnesses </i>and <i>San Pablito</i>.</p>

THE PROJECT  ·  EL PROYECTO
 

                                                    HANNA YETSALI   ·  INFANCY / INFANCIA
 
   
Witnesses is a non-profit, itinerant photographic project consisting of 11 portraits of inhabitants of San Pablito Pahuatlán (Puebla, Mexico). Each portrait represents a stage of the human life cycle: from childhood to old age. It is accompanied by a second exhibition called San Pablito with 56 pictures documenting the life of this community that produces amate paper. 
The goal is to create, on the one hand, a tribute to indigenous people in general wherever they are and to encourage awareness of the ecological, social and cultural challenges most communities like San Pablito confront.  And, on the other, for the exhibit to travel the world; so far, the show has been confirmed in two museums.
 
Testigos es un proyecto fotográfico itinerante sin fines de lucro que consiste en 11 retratos de habitantes de San Pablito Pahuatlán (Puebla, México). Cada retrato representa una etapa del ciclo de la vida humana: desde la infancia hasta la vejez. Se acompaña de una segunda exposición llamada San Pablito con 56 fotografías que plasman la vida de esta comunidad que produce papel amate. 
El objetivo es crear, por un lado, un homenaje a los pueblos indígenas en general dondequiera que se encuentren y fomentar la conciencia de los desafíos ecológicos, sociales y culturales que enfrentan la mayoría de las comunidades como San Pablito. Y, por otro, para que la exposición recorra el mundo; hasta ahora, la muestra ha sido confirmada en dos museos.

Within the framework of the UN’s observance of 2019 as the International Year of Indigenous Languages and that 2021 will commemorate 500 years of the “conquest” of Latin America, this campaign comprises the production of a project with two exhibits: Witnesses and San Pablito.
All production steps will be described at the end of this presentation. Though this is an important project for us (Don Genaro and me), it is equally important for all the San Pablito people and their survival as artisans of the amate paper for which they are known worldwide.

Dentro del marco de la ONU, la celebración de 2019 como Año Internacional de las Lenguas Indígenas y de que en 2021 se conmemorarán los 500 años de la ""conquista"" de América Latina, esta campaña comprende la producción de un proyecto con dos exposiciones: Testigos y San Pablito. 
Todos los pasos de producción se describirán al final de esta presentación . Si bien éste es un proyecto importante para nosotros (Don Genaro y yo), es igualmente importante para todo el pueblo de San Pablito y su supervivencia como artesanos del papel amate por el que son conocidos en todo el mundo.

DON GENARO  
 

 

Without Don Genaro, this project could not have been born. I like to call him the guardian of the amate paper for his dedication in keeping the ancient knowledge on how to produce it. 

Sin  Don Genaro, este proyecto no podría haber sido posible. Me gusta llamarlo el guardián del papel amate por su dedicación en mantener el antiguo conocimiento de cómo producirlo.

 http://gaalcohen.com/index.php      AND FINALLY  ·  Y FINALMENTE  YOUR SUPPORT MATTERS                                              HAVE A LOOK AT AN EARLIER PRODUCED PROJECT (2015)The Museo Cabañas is a UNESCO World Heritage site. It has more than 200 years of history and stands 222 steps from the largest covered Latin American market called San Juan de Dios. When the museum was an orphanage, many youngsters went to work at the market, and the market always helped the hospice as it was called. Once it became a museum, both entities grew apart. And with the idea of a group of ITESO University students, in 2015, together we joined them once again. TU APOYO IMPORTA MUESTRA DE  UN PROYECTO REALIZADO EN 2015El Museo Cabañas es Patrimonio de la Humanidad de la UNESCO. Tiene más de 200 años de historia y se encuentra a 222 pasos del mayor mercado techado de América Latina llamado San Juan de Dios. Cuando el museo era un orfanato, muchos jóvenes trabajaban en el mercado, y el mercado siempre ayudaba al hospicio, como se le llamaba. Una vez que se convirtió en museo, ambas entidades se distanciaron. Y con la idea de un grupo de estudiantes de la Universidad ITESO, en 2015, unimos estas entidades una vez más.                                                                             ___________________________________   13 STEPS OF PRODUCTION Description of each one of them in chronological order and with information about our suppliers. 13 PASOS DE PRODUCCIÓN Descripción de cada uno de ellos en orden cronológico y con información sobre nuestros proveedores.                                                                        JORDY 1: US$ 4,432Acquisition of 30 canvases of amate paper (47x95 in).

<h3><b>GRAZIE A TUTTI!</b></h3>La
campagna di raccolta fondi per il progetto Borgo Vecchio Factory si è
conclusa sabato 8 novembre con un enorme successo: oltre al traguardo
iniziale che ci eravamo posti abbiamo superato anche il <b>secondo <i>goal
</i></b>che
ci permetterà di organizzare altri due workshop con due streetartist
e la mostra finale per le strade di Borgo Vecchio.
<p>
</p>
<p>A
tutti voi che avete donato va il nostro più profondo ringraziamento:
il <b>successo della campagna dipende da voi</b>!</p>

<p><i>The crowd-funding campaign for Borgo Vecchio Factory ended Saturday,
November 8 and it was a success: in addition to the initial goal we
set, we also reached the second one that will allow us to organize
two more workshops with two streetartist and a final exhibition along the streets of Borgo Vecchio.</i></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i>We
want to say thank you to all of you: the success of
the campaign depends on you!</i></p>

<h3><b>MESSAGGIO IMPORTANTE!</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Grazie al supporto dei primi
benefattori in meno di due settimane BORGO VECCHIO FACTORY ha già
raggiunto l'obiettivo di 5000 euro che si era prefissato. Con la
somma raccolta, PUSH, PER ESEMPIO e EMA JONS si impegnano quindi a
garantire l’organizzazione di un ciclo semestrale di workshop di
pittura creativa per i bambini di Borgo Vecchio e la relativa
realizzazione di opere di street art sui muri del quartiere.</p>

<br/><p>[ITA] Il progetto nasce come prosecuzione di “Frequenza 200”, esperienza intrapresa nel 2012 da “Arteca Onlus” e “Per Esempio Onlus”, sempre in collaborazione con <b><a href=""http://emajons.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ema Jons</a></b>, ha coinvolto 20 bambini e ragazzi, tra i 5 e i 15 anni, tra Gennaio e Febbraio 2014, proponendo <b>laboratori artistici doposcuola</b>. I disegni e i dipinti prodotti durante i laboratori sono stati utilizzati poi come bozzetti per dei murales realizzati a più mani sui prospetti delle case del quartiere. L’iniziativa ha stimolato l’intera comunità a riflettere sui propri luoghi e a vederli con occhi nuovi per rivalorizzarli e rivalutarli. La realizzazione di un’opera d’arte “pubblica” ha infatti il merito di mettere tutti nelle condizioni di agire concretamente sul proprio contesto quotidiano, far riacquisire una rinnovata consapevolezza delle proprie capacità e smorzare così la mancanza di fiducia in se stessi.
<b>L’obiettivo di BORGO VECCHIO FACTORY è di riproporre il progetto per altri sei mesi, a partire da Novembre 2014, coinvolgendo nuove famiglie e nuovi spazi.</b></p>
<br/><p><i>[ENG] The project, started in 2012 by the organisations ""Arteca onlus"" and ""Per Esempio Onlus"" always in partnership with <b><a href=""http://emajons.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ema Jons</a></b>, engaged 20 children and teenagers in <b>afterschool creative workshops</b>. The drawings and paintings produced in these workshops were used to decorate buildings in the neighbourhood. This initiative has stimulated the entire community to reflect on their neighbourhood. To see it from a different perspective. To revalue it. And learn to love it. By creating a public art piece like this, people can influence their surroundings, become aware of their own potential, and build their self-esteem.   
<b>The main goal of BORGO VECCHIO FACTORY is to run the project for another 6 months. Starting in November 2014, engaging new families and new areas in Palermo.</b></i></p>

MESSAGGIO IMPORTANTE!

Grazie al supporto dei primi
benefattori in meno di due settimane BORGO VECCHIO FACTORY ha già
raggiunto l'obiettivo di 5000 euro che si era prefissato. Con la
somma raccolta, PUSH, PER ESEMPIO e EMA JONS si impegnano quindi a
garantire l’organizzazione di un ciclo semestrale di workshop di
pittura creativa per i bambini di Borgo Vecchio e la relativa
realizzazione di opere di street art sui muri del quartiere.
Adesso però vogliamo fare di più: ci
piacerebbe arricchire il progetto invitando altri due streetartist
 a tenere due ulteriori cicli di workshop della durata di un mese
ciascuno, per far confrontare i bambini con nuovi stili, nuove voci e
nuove storie. Da questa esperienza trarremo poi una mostra
fotografica  che sarà installata per le strade di Borgo Vecchio,
cornice unica e ideale per raccontare questa storia.
Per il nostro sogno in grande abbiamo
stabilito quindi un nuovo obiettivo di 3000 euro, con
cui copriremo le spese degli spostamenti e di soggiorno dei due
artisti, l'acquisto dei materiali per i nuovi laboratori e
l'installazione della mostra. Chi ancora non conoscesse il progetto

Cos'è BORGO VECCHIO FACTORYWhat's BORGO VECCHIO FACTORY

[ITA] BORGO VECCHIO FACTORY è un progetto di promozione sociale proposto dall'organizzazione no profit PUSH, in collaborazione con lo street artist Ema Jons e Per Esempio Onlus, che prevede la realizzazione di un ciclo semestrale di laboratori di pittura creativa per 20 bambini del quartiere Borgo Vecchio a Palermo, antico rione abitato per la maggior parte da famiglie con gravi difficoltà economiche. Con un tasso di disoccupazione del 40%, un diffuso analfabetismo e un insufficiente livello di scolarizzazione, il quartiere vive un’evidente condizione di esclusione sociale causata dalla mancanza di servizi e un elevato tasso di criminalità.
[ENG]  BORGO VECCHIO FACTORY is a project of social progress promoted by non-profit organization PUSH, together with street artist Ema Jons and Per Esempio Onlus. It aims to realize a six-month cycle of creative painting workshops for 20 children of the Borgo Vecchio neighborhood, in Palermo, historical area where most of the families live in poverty. Unemployment reaches 40% and access to education is extremely low. The neighbourhood is hit by social unrest, due to an absence of public services and high crime rates.

[ITA] Il progetto nasce come prosecuzione di “Frequenza 200”, esperienza intrapresa nel 2012 da “Arteca Onlus” e “Per Esempio Onlus”, sempre in collaborazione con Ema Jons, ha coinvolto 20 bambini e ragazzi, tra i 5 e i 15 anni, tra Gennaio e Febbraio 2014, proponendo laboratori artistici doposcuola. I disegni e i dipinti prodotti durante i laboratori sono stati utilizzati poi come bozzetti per dei murales realizzati a più mani sui prospetti delle case del quartiere.

[ENG] Ema is a street artist. Or as he would say “somebody who paints walls, a graffiti artist”. When running creative workshops with children, he got the idea of using children’s artworks as a first draft for a series of big murals. With the children, he painted these on houses in Borgo Vecchio. The community and the children’s families have happily supported him. 

Per Esempio Onlus is a non-profit organisation that works to empower people that are at risk of being socially marginalised. Their mission is to increase social cohesion. Per Esempio supports activities aiming at the full development of the person and community. They choose an unconventional approach to learning in combination with methodologies to support an intercultural dialogue.
PUSH is a non-profit organisation based in Palermo, with the objective to “push” communities, public administration as well as local organisations to become an active part of urban regeneration through social innovation. PUSH creates, lunches and sustains projects and ideas for urban and social regeneration through a holistic, multidisciplinary and cross-channel approach.",14.0,1,"1 Campaign

can experience the incredible artwork that was made by some of the greatest artists

critical target of 500 USD *<br/></b></p><p><b>*The bigger the budget, the better the project! *</b> </p><p>My name is Melanie 
Gritzka del Villar, a half-Filipina half-German artist based in Bangkok.
 I am a painter who works on all kinds of surfaces: canvas, card, 
driftwood, found objects, walls in the street. 
</p><p>Check out some of my work here on my website: <a href=""http://www.gritzkadelvillar.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.gritzkadelvillar.com</a></p>
<p>I am also a part-time lecturer at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok. Other than that I work on my own art and art projects.</p>
<p>My current aspiration is to do an art workshop with children of the 
district of Dharavi, Mumbai, India. I have a strong desire to work
 outside of my usual formal set-up at university and work hands-on with 
local communities.</p>
<p>I feel it is important to share one's passion and that it is through 
true passion that one can reach out and inspire others. I would like to 
work with the community of Dharavi to exchange knowledge, skills 
and experience, and to encourage the value of creativity and 
imagination, especially amongst the children. I also want to encourage 
the idea that one does not need much to create a work of art - the 
simplest of means can create amazing results!</p>
<p>The 5-day workshop will take place October 19th to 24th 2014, in the slum of Dharavi, using the organization <a href=""http://www.urbz.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.urbz.net</a> as platform to reach out to the community.
</p><p>In supporting my project, I feel you are helping in sharing this 
enthusiasm and belief I have in art as means of expression. Working with
 recycled materials is a great way to help excite the value of the means available to us in the present moment, as well as the appreciation of beauty in our everyday 
lives. I feel it is a project that - albeit humble in scale - can have 
invaluable effects on the children I will work with. This project is 
based on my belief in sharing, encouraging and exchanging creativity.
</p> <p> </p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p><b>CRITICAL TARGET:</b> My <b>critical target</b> is a<b> MINIMUM of 500 USD</b> (approx. 20,000THB), which will hopefully cover the following:</p>
<p>- Materials for the workshop: paint, recycled material.</p>
<p>- Assistance for the workshop: translator, local craftsmen to help execute the art works.</p>
<p><b>IDEAL TARGET: Realistically</b> though, my target would be <b>2000 USD</b>
 as that would not only ensure a solid budget for the workshop expenses 
and ensure a decent number of participants but it would also cover my personal costs: airfare, accommodation, visa, vaccinations, and basic daily needs such as food and 
transportation.
</p>
<p><b>What you will get in return for your support:</b></p>
<p>I will send you a personal THANK YOU note.</p>
<p>I will also make a summary document and a video of the workshop and will share it with you.</p>
<p>PLUS: If you are one of the ten first people to contribute 100USD or 
above, I will make you a unique little cardboard collage of mine and 
send it to you via post!
</p><p><b>In case I do not reach my target budget:</b></p>
<p>All funds will nevertheless go to the realization of the project. I 
will try and adjust the workshop to whatever amount of funding I will 
have at the end of this campaign. I am good at improvisation, so I can 
guarantee I will make something happen, even if funds are low.

</p> <p> </p><h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I have been working in education for eight years now, and I have lead 
workshops at St. John's Int'l School Bangkok as well as Chulalongkorn 
University Bangkok. Each time I work with children I 
realize the great potential in these creative exchanges, beneficial to both: teacher and students. 
</p><p>I have a deep desire to inspire others. Sometimes this means really 
going beyond and outside one's comfort zones to explore new 
possibilities and horizons. I feel that this project is but one step 
towards sharing more of myself with others. I believe that creativity 
and imagination are qualities that need to be nurtured, especially in 
children who, although naturally gifted, often do not get the support or
 encouragement needed to realize their artistic expression.</p>
<p>By helping me push through with this art workshop, I feel we are 
together helping to enable children from less privileged communities 
realize their potential. At the same time we will actively nurture those
 human qualities that are essential for personal growth and on a larger 
scale, a healthy society: collaboration, sharing, imagination and 
creativity.</p>
<p></p> <p> </p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is a self-initiated project and I will rely on the help and 
participation of the local community of Dharavi. However, since I 
will be working with and through the staff of URBZ, I am confident that 
together we will be able to solve logistical challenges of finding 
participants, devising a feasible time-frame for the workshop, as well 
finding a solution to storage and display of the final art works.</p>
<p></p> <p> </p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I value and truly appreciate any form of support. If you cannot 
contribute to the funding scheme, I would be very happy if you could 
help spread the word of my project initiative via email, social media 
and of course, the Indiegogo share tools!</p>

In August 2012, I was exposed to a 5,000 lbs Vehicle-Borne IED explosion that rendered me unconscious. I suffer from PTSD, multiple Traumatic Brain Injuries, and chronic pain. As I began to seek treatment, I found that art has provided the best escape and relaxation, when compared to the multitude of pharmaceuticals they want to push on you. Since last year, I have become very involved in painting and would like to begin my own nonprofit organization to provide art therapy, and art for pleasure, to local combat Veterans. The funds raised here would allow me to file the paperwork with the State and Federal Government for 501(C)(3) tax-exemption status. In the meantime, I will create a website to offer my art to  the public. All profits will go directly to the mission - 'Purple Heart Art' -'Healing through Art'. I would love to collect art from local artists as well, in the form of in-kind donations to auction off and raise funds for the cause. I also plan to assist other veterans on a weekly (or more) basis to conduct these art therapy sessions. Research shows that art and self-expression are beneficial to the treatment of PTSD and TBI's, that many Soldiers are coming home with today. The nonprofit will provide completely free art sessions with injured Military Service Members and their families at the local V.A. Hospital in Lebanon, PA. Purple Heart Art would also be interested in providing take-home art supplies for these injured Vets.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>I need the funding to file my paperwork to form my nonprofit, 'Purple Heart Art'. I will also use the funds to establish my website and purchase the domain. With the remaining funds I will purchase art supplies, and canvases to build my portfolio of art, before I offer it to the public, as well as, to use these supplies with the Veterans at the local VA Hospital. Art can either be taken home with the Vet, or donated for future sale, rolling money back into the organization. All profits from the artwork sold will go to benefit 'Purple Heart Art'. I will also be purchasing a 'tent' for the local Art Festival in my hometown, which runs a couple hundred dollars. This will give great exposure to a brand new organization with a great purpose, and would allow me to offer individuals the opportunity to generously donate, and/or, collect a piece of artwork from myself, and other local artists. I would also like to print t-shirts for donors, as well as publicly recognize them through social media outlets. </p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>If you have ever been to war, you understand how incredibly changed you return home.  Those moments will never leave you, but they do not always have to be viewed in a negative manner. Through art I have discovered that painting my emotions, feelings, and simply distracting myself by putting paint to a canvas has been the best therapy that can't be duplicated by pharmaceutical poison. By donating, you will allow me to more intensely pursue my passion of art, all while providing other injured service members the same opportunity. Not only will you be providing the foundation for what is certainly a needed service to our Veterans, you will be contributing to a worthy cause, in the making.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>If you cannot donate, I understand, believe me. You could certainly help by sharing my campaign, though.

</p><p><b>Die phantastische Installation „Metamorphosen“ von Geet Robert Chorley soll zur Luminale mit LED-Lampen leuchten </b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Licht ist die Quelle allen Lebens. Es bestimmt unsere Jahreszeiten, unsere Tageszeiten und hat gleichzeitig großen Anteil an unseren Stimmungen. Dennoch lässt sich das Licht als solches schwer fassen. Es ist sogar für uns Menschen unsichtbar. Nur durch Reflexion können wir einen Lichtstrahl wahrnehmen, aber eigentlich ist Licht gar nicht weiß, sondern setzt sich aus sechs Spektralfarben zusammen. Aller physikalischen Lehren zum Trotz bleibt aber die Natur des Lichts für uns Menschen zauberhaft.  </p>
<p>
</p><p>Diese zauberhafte Natur des Lichts versucht der in England geborene Metall- und Lichtkünstler Robert Geet Chorley in seiner Metall-Licht-Farb-Installation „Metamorphosen“ – Metal, Magic, Lightshow“ zu veranschaulichen und ihr auf künstlerische Weise näherzukommen. </p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Die Installation ist wie der Titel „Metamorphosen“ schon andeutet ein lebendiges Werk, das in jahrelanger künstlerischer Arbeit entstanden ist und stetig weiter entwickelt wird. Es ist eine Komposition aus übergroßen Metallobjekten und sechs gefärbten Scheinwerfern, die in je einer Spektralfarbe leuchten. Sie stellt eine Art Naturphantasie dar, die den Betrachtern das Wunder der Natur vor Augen führt. Für die jeweilige Lightshow programmiert der Künstler eine jeweils neue Abfolge von Lichtsequenzen, die der Installation Leben einhauchen. Die Lichtsequenzen können auch durch begleitende Musik rhythmisch ausgelöst werden.  </p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Der nächste Entwicklungsschritt des Werkes ist die Ausstattung der Installation mit sechs modernen energiebewussten LED-Lampen, die der Künstler nun anschaffen und in die Installation integrieren muss. Diese Weiterentwicklung bringt nicht allein künstlerisch neue und interessante Effekte, so sind nun die Spektralfarben alle zusammen in einer Lampe enthalten, was eine wesentlich spektakulärere Lichtschau ermöglicht. Die moderne LED-Technologie trägt auch dem Nachhaltigkeitsgedanken Rechnung, da sie sehr stromsparend arbeitet und stützt den gesamten natursymbolischen Gehalt der Installation.   </b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Für die Weiterentwicklung dieses phantastischen Kunstwerks, das Unternehmen und Institutionen als außergewöhnliches Highlight für jedes wichtige Event nutzen können, ist der Metallkünstler Robert Geet Chorley auf Unterstützung durch Sponsoren angewiesen. Überzeugen Sie sich im Videoclip von der phantastischen Wirkung der Installation „Metamorphosen“ und ihrer magischen Ausstrahlung, die eine Ihrer nächsten Veranstaltungen zu einem einmaligen Erlebnis machen würde. So wie die Installation bereits in der Vergangenheit der Ambiente-Messe und dem Frankfurter Museumsuferfest oder der Zeil-Galerie zu außergewöhnlicher Strahlkraft verhalf. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/379724/files/20140219053255-IMG_4442.jpeg?1392816775"" src="""" style=""width: 134.9090909090909px; height: 203px;""/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Die Installation „Metamorphosen“ ist eine mietbare mobile Lightshow.

<p>
</p><p>Die Installation „Metamorphosen“ soll zur diesjährigen Luminale (vom 30. März bis zum 4. April 2014) im Rahmen der Veranstaltungen des Kunstvereins Offenbach erstmals einem breiteren Publikum in ihrer weiterentwickelten Form präsentiert werden. Das großartige Spektakel aus Metall, Licht und Farben wird an allen Abenden der Luminale im Raum des Kunstvereins am Platz der Deutschen Einheit Nummer 5 zu bewundern sein. Unterschiedliche Programmpunkte wie eine Jazz-Session, zwei Poetry Slams, eine Mode-Phantasie sowie eine fulminante Finissage machen jeden Abend im Licht dieser Installation zu einem eigenen Event und fesselnden Erlebnis. </p>

<p>
</p><p>Die phantastische Installation „Metamorphosen“ besteht aus zwei bis vier meterhohen handgefertigten Metallobjekten, Licht, Farbe und bei Bedarf Musik. Das Hauptobjekt „Atomic Genetic Mutation“ ein kunstvoll gestalteter Kokon ist umgeben von vier riesenhaften graziösen Blumen, die in ihrer Unterschiedlichkeit die Artenvielfalt in der Natur widerspiegeln. Der Kokon  stellt lichtpulsierend in den Spektralfarben die Keimzelle neuen Lebens dar. Er kann Schönes oder Schreckliches gebären, je nach menschlichem Einfluss und Handeln. Umfasst wird die Skulptur von einem Hexagon aus farbigem Lampen. Beim Eintreten in dieses zauberhafte Naturreich muss man allerdings vorbei an einem dunklen Herrscher, der das gesamte Szenario mit glühenden Augen und langem Speer bewacht. Die Skulptur „Nature fights back“ zeigt auch wie die Natur sich wehrt.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/379701/files/20140219052304-IMG_4426.jpg?1392816184"" src="""" style=""width: 253.10328638497654px; height: 169px;""/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Die romantisch-surrealistische Installation greift in ihren einzelnen Objekten und in ihren farbigen Lichtspielen sowohl kunsthistorische (Romantik, Jugendstil) wie auch aktuelle Themen unserer Zeit (Ohnmacht gegen die Ausbeutung der Natur) auf und führt uns ein Schauspiel der Kräfte zwischen Mensch und Natur vor Augen, bei dem es keine Gewinner gibt. </span><br/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/379677/files/20140219051231-100_2571.jpg?1392815551"" src="""" style=""width: 424.8921161825726px; height: 319px;""/></p>

<p>
</p><p>Der in England geborene Künstler Geet Robert Chorley lebt seit Anfang der neunziger Jahre in Offenbach Bürgel, wo er sein Atelier Bürgelwood-Studios betreibt, in dem er seine Installation „Metamorphosen – Metall, Magie, Licht“ kontinuierlich weiterentwickelt und um verschiedene Metallobjekte erweitert hat. Zuletzt entstand ein Detail zur Skulptur „Lover's Flower“. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Geet Chorley beschäftigt sich in seiner künstlerischen Arbeit häufig mit dem Thema Natur und der Ignoranz des Menschen ihr gegenüber. Seine Objekte haben demgemäß eine ambivalente Ausstrahlung, die durch Größe und Materialbeschaffenheit einerseits bedrohlich, durch phantasievolle verspielte Formen, mit Elementen aus dem Jugendstil gleichzeitig zart und elegant wirken. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Als Künstler realisierte er zahlreiche Ausstellungen im europäischen Ausland und in Deutschland allein und in Gruppen. Seine Metallkunst war zu sehen bei verschiedenen Messen wie beispielsweise auf der Ambiente in Frankfurt und auf dem Museumsuferfest sowie in der Zeilgalerie in Frankfurt, im Kunstbahnhof Neu-Isenburg, in der Galerie SINNTROZ, bei Spaceplace in Frankfurt und White Cube Frankfurt. Geet Robert Chorley ist außerdem Schatzmeister des Kunstvereins Offenbach e. V.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In seinem Atelier entwirft und fertigt der Künstler auch Möbel und Wohnaccessoires aus Holz und Metal, sowie Kunstobjekte, die durch ihre phantasievollen Formen einen ganz eigenen Charme verbreiten. Er ist außerdem als Lichttechniker tätig und hat viele Jahre die Bühnenbeleuchtung im Künstlerhaus Mousonturm realisiert.</p>

<p></p><br/></div>","KurzbeschreibungDie
phantastische Installation „Metamorphosen“ von Geet Chorley ist
ein lebendiges Werk, das stetig weiter entwickelt wird. Sie besteht
aus meterhohen handgefertigten Metallobjekten, Licht und Farbe. Das
Hauptobjekt, ein kunstvoll gestalteter Kokon in der Mitte, ist
umgeben von vier riesenhaften graziösen Blumen, die in ihrer
Unterschiedlichkeit die Artenvielfalt in der Natur widerspiegeln. Die
romantisch-surrealistische Installation greift sowohl
kunsthistorische (Romantik, Jugendstil) wie auch aktuelle Themen
unserer Zeit (Ohnmacht gegen die Ausbeutung der Natur) auf und führt
uns ein Schauspiel der Kräfte zwischen Mensch und Natur vor Augen,
bei dem es keine Gewinner gibt. 


Mit Hilfe
moderner LED-Lampen wird bei der diesjährigen Luminale das
Farbspektrum des Lichts erstmals in allen Zwischentönen sichtbar.
Für die jeweilige Lightshow programmiert der Künstler eine jeweils
neue Abfolge von Lichtsequenzen, die der Installation Leben
einhauchen.Metal, Magic, Lightshow vor der Verwandlung

Die phantastische Installation „Metamorphosen“ von Geet Robert Chorley soll zur Luminale mit LED-Lampen leuchten 

Licht ist die Quelle allen Lebens. Es bestimmt unsere Jahreszeiten, unsere Tageszeiten und hat gleichzeitig großen Anteil an unseren Stimmungen. Dennoch lässt sich das Licht als solches schwer fassen. Es ist sogar für uns Menschen unsichtbar. Nur durch Reflexion können wir einen Lichtstrahl wahrnehmen, aber eigentlich ist Licht gar nicht weiß, sondern setzt sich aus sechs Spektralfarben zusammen. Aller physikalischen Lehren zum Trotz bleibt aber die Natur des Lichts für uns Menschen zauberhaft.  

Diese zauberhafte Natur des Lichts versucht der in England geborene Metall- und Lichtkünstler Robert Geet Chorley in seiner Metall-Licht-Farb-Installation „Metamorphosen“ – Metal, Magic, Lightshow“ zu veranschaulichen und ihr auf künstlerische Weise näherzukommen. 

Die Installation und Ihr Nutzen:

Die Installation ist wie der Titel „Metamorphosen“ schon andeutet ein lebendiges Werk, das in jahrelanger künstlerischer Arbeit entstanden ist und stetig weiter entwickelt wird. Es ist eine Komposition aus übergroßen Metallobjekten und sechs gefärbten Scheinwerfern, die in je einer Spektralfarbe leuchten. Sie stellt eine Art Naturphantasie dar, die den Betrachtern das Wunder der Natur vor Augen führt. Für die jeweilige Lightshow programmiert der Künstler eine jeweils neue Abfolge von Lichtsequenzen, die der Installation Leben einhauchen. Die Lichtsequenzen können auch durch begleitende Musik rhythmisch ausgelöst werden.  

Der nächste Entwicklungsschritt des Werkes ist die Ausstattung der Installation mit sechs modernen energiebewussten LED-Lampen, die der Künstler nun anschaffen und in die Installation integrieren muss. Diese Weiterentwicklung bringt nicht allein künstlerisch neue und interessante Effekte, so sind nun die Spektralfarben alle zusammen in einer Lampe enthalten, was eine wesentlich spektakulärere Lichtschau ermöglicht. Die moderne LED-Technologie trägt auch dem Nachhaltigkeitsgedanken Rechnung, da sie sehr stromsparend arbeitet und stützt den gesamten natursymbolischen Gehalt der Installation.   

Für die Weiterentwicklung dieses phantastischen Kunstwerks, das Unternehmen und Institutionen als außergewöhnliches Highlight für jedes wichtige Event nutzen können, ist der Metallkünstler Robert Geet Chorley auf Unterstützung durch Sponsoren angewiesen. Überzeugen Sie sich im Videoclip von der phantastischen Wirkung der Installation „Metamorphosen“ und ihrer magischen Ausstrahlung, die eine Ihrer nächsten Veranstaltungen zu einem einmaligen Erlebnis machen würde. So wie die Installation bereits in der Vergangenheit der Ambiente-Messe und dem Frankfurter Museumsuferfest oder der Zeil-Galerie zu außergewöhnlicher Strahlkraft verhalf. Die Installation „Metamorphosen“ ist eine mietbare mobile Lightshow. Der Empfangsbereich eines Unternehmens oder einer Event-Location würde mit der Metallinstallation „Metamorphosen“ in ein phantastisches Reich aus Metall, Licht und   Farbe verwandelt werden, dessen Zauber seine Wirkung auf die Gäste nicht verfehlen würde. Helfen Sie dabei, dass dieses Märchen aus Licht und Metall sich weiterentwickeln kann und uns das Wunder der Natur künstlerisch erleben lässt. Ausstellung bei der Luminale:

Die Installation „Metamorphosen“ soll zur diesjährigen Luminale (vom 30. März bis zum 4. April 2014) im Rahmen der Veranstaltungen des Kunstvereins Offenbach erstmals einem breiteren Publikum in ihrer weiterentwickelten Form präsentiert werden. Das großartige Spektakel aus Metall, Licht und Farben wird an allen Abenden der Luminale im Raum des Kunstvereins am Platz der Deutschen Einheit Nummer 5 zu bewundern sein. Unterschiedliche Programmpunkte wie eine Jazz-Session, zwei Poetry Slams, eine Mode-Phantasie sowie eine fulminante Finissage machen jeden Abend im Licht dieser Installation zu einem eigenen Event und fesselnden Erlebnis. 

Mit Ihrer Hilfe kann der Künstler seine Installation auf den neusten Stand der Technik bringen, zu neuer Strahlkraft verhelfen und unserer Stadt Offenbach einen Logenplatz über die Grenzen hinaus bei der diesjährigen Luminale sichern. Begleitprogramm ""Metamorphosen""Geet Robert Chorley's ""metal magic lightshow""Surrealisstische MetallinstallationSonntag, 30.03.14  Axel Kemper-Moll & Jessica Born in concertJazz mit der Blues und Soul Sängerin Jessica BornMontag31.03.14 Katharina Eismann, Wolf-Dieter Köster: Electric Roses Lyrik und Klang PerformanceDienstag 01.04.14 Geet Chorley: MetamorphosenDer Künstler präsentiert die metal magic lightshow im GesprächMittwoch 02.04.14 Astrid Merger: Weiße SeidePerformance: Modephantasie in WeißDonnerstag 03.04.14 Ingrid Walter: Lyrik und Kurzprosa zu MetamorphosenLesung zu Licht und klassischer MusikFreitag04.04.14 StefanX: DJ ambient atmosphere Abschlussparty mit DJZur Symbolik der Installation: 

Die phantastische Installation „Metamorphosen“ besteht aus zwei bis vier meterhohen handgefertigten Metallobjekten, Licht, Farbe und bei Bedarf Musik. Das Hauptobjekt „Atomic Genetic Mutation“ ein kunstvoll gestalteter Kokon ist umgeben von vier riesenhaften graziösen Blumen, die in ihrer Unterschiedlichkeit die Artenvielfalt in der Natur widerspiegeln. Der Kokon  stellt lichtpulsierend in den Spektralfarben die Keimzelle neuen Lebens dar. Er kann Schönes oder Schreckliches gebären, je nach menschlichem Einfluss und Handeln. Umfasst wird die Skulptur von einem Hexagon aus farbigem Lampen. Beim Eintreten in dieses zauberhafte Naturreich muss man allerdings vorbei an einem dunklen Herrscher, der das gesamte Szenario mit glühenden Augen und langem Speer bewacht. Die Skulptur „Nature fights back“ zeigt auch wie die Natur sich wehrt.  Die romantisch-surrealistische Installation greift in ihren einzelnen Objekten und in ihren farbigen Lichtspielen sowohl kunsthistorische (Romantik, Jugendstil) wie auch aktuelle Themen unserer Zeit (Ohnmacht gegen die Ausbeutung der Natur) auf und führt uns ein Schauspiel der Kräfte zwischen Mensch und Natur vor Augen, bei dem es keine Gewinner gibt. 
Mit Hilfe moderner LED-Lampen wird das Farbspektrum des Lichts mit allen Zwischentönen sichtbar. Der Betrachter sieht das Objekt im gleißend gelben Licht eines Sommertages, im blauen Licht um Mitternacht. Die Verwandlung, die der Installation ihren Titel gegeben hat, wird auch im Spiel der Farben sichtbar.

Der Künstler:

Der in England geborene Künstler Geet Robert Chorley lebt seit Anfang der neunziger Jahre in Offenbach Bürgel, wo er sein Atelier Bürgelwood-Studios betreibt, in dem er seine Installation „Metamorphosen – Metall, Magie, Licht“ kontinuierlich weiterentwickelt und um verschiedene Metallobjekte erweitert hat. Zuletzt entstand ein Detail zur Skulptur „Lover's Flower“. 

Geet Chorley beschäftigt sich in seiner künstlerischen Arbeit häufig mit dem Thema Natur und der Ignoranz des Menschen ihr gegenüber. Seine Objekte haben demgemäß eine ambivalente Ausstrahlung, die durch Größe und Materialbeschaffenheit einerseits bedrohlich, durch phantasievolle verspielte Formen, mit Elementen aus dem Jugendstil gleichzeitig zart und elegant wirken. 

Als Künstler realisierte er zahlreiche Ausstellungen im europäischen Ausland und in Deutschland allein und in Gruppen. Seine Metallkunst war zu sehen bei verschiedenen Messen wie beispielsweise auf der Ambiente in Frankfurt und auf dem Museumsuferfest sowie in der Zeilgalerie in Frankfurt, im Kunstbahnhof Neu-Isenburg, in der Galerie SINNTROZ, bei Spaceplace in Frankfurt und White Cube Frankfurt. Geet Robert Chorley ist außerdem Schatzmeister des Kunstvereins Offenbach e. V.

In seinem Atelier entwirft und fertigt der Künstler auch Möbel und Wohnaccessoires aus Holz und Metal, sowie Kunstobjekte, die durch ihre phantasievollen Formen einen ganz eigenen Charme verbreiten. Er ist außerdem als Lichttechniker tätig und hat viele Jahre die Bühnenbeleuchtung im Künstlerhaus Mousonturm realisiert.

<p>The Inside Out Project began with a wish by TED prize winner, JR, “to
turn the world inside out”. Inside Out Project is a collaboration between TED
Talks &amp; French street artist, JR, which began in March 2011. It is a
global, large-scale participatory art project, driven by the purpose of
transforming messages of personal identity into artistic works. Inside Out aims
to give anyone and everyone a voice through his or her image. Black and white
photographic portraits are pasted in the streets of cities around the world,
revealing and sharing the untold stories of everyday people. More on the Inside
Out Project <a href=""http://www.insideoutproject.net/en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<p>Since JR’s initial project launched, the concept grew and 15 countries
around the world decided to unite and simultaneously paste 5,000 portraits in
the streets of their cities to draw attention to one issue: climate change.
Thus the new action ‘Inside Out Project | Be the Change’ was born.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/413137/files/20140305122436-Mockup-Interieur-P.jpg?1394051076"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p>The action was born from the realization that climate change is not just
about global warming, but about the human stories that unite us as world
citizens. The global concept is about bringing people together from different
fields, backgrounds and interests to create a unified message, which comes
directly from the people for the people. Now more than ever, we have a
responsibility to share our hopes and dreams in order to inspire real change.</p><p></p><p></p>
<p></p>BE THE CHANGE is the biggest and only multi-national action within
the Inside Out Project to date, with the Inside Out Group Action leaders from
Athens, Greece and Juarez, Mexico coordinating the project, globally. <br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/414914/files/20140306064001-Mockup-Interieur-Planisphere.jpg?1394116801"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The 26 cities in 15 countries

</p><p>El Proyecto
INSIDE OUT es una iniciativa por el artista JR, ganador del premio TED
2011 y es un proyecto global de arte participativo que transforma los mensajes
de identidad personal en piezas de trabajo artístico. El reto consiste en
utilizar retratos fotográficos en blanco y negro para descubrir, revelar y
compartir los rostros de personas e historias que no han sido contadas
alrededor del mundo. Éstas imágenes digitales se envían a las oficinas
centrales donde se imprimen en formato de póster y se envían a los creadores
del proyecto para que las exhiban en en sus comunidades. Las imagenes pueden
ser instaladas en diferentes lugares, desde una imagen en una ventana a cientos
de imagenes en un edificio abandonado o un estadio Estas intervenciones serán
documentadas, archivadas y estarán disponibles para ser vistas virtualmente.</p>
<p>Desde el
proyecto inicial de JR lanzado, el concepto creció y 15 países alrededor del
mundo decididieron unirse y pegar
simultáneamente 5.000 retratos en las calles de sus ciudades respectivas para lanzar
mensajes sobre: cambio del clima. Así el nuevo interior del `de la acción hacia
fuera proyecta | Sea el cambio' fue llevado. La acción fue llevada de la
realización que el cambio el cambio cliamtico; un cambiono que no solamente
habla sobre el alietamiento global, pero tambien sobre las historias humanas
que nos unen como ciudadanos del mundo. El concepto global trata de unir a
gente de diversos campos, fondos e
intereses a crear un mensaje unificado, que viene directamente de la gente para
la gente. Ahora más que nunca, tenemos la responsabilidad de compartir nuestras
esperanzas y sueños para inspirar un cambio verdadero. </p>

Project | PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKAbout The BookBe
the Change, A Global Inside Out Project, presents a photography book compiling
more than 1000 images capturing the BTC | IOP Action
that took place simultaneously in 15 countries and 26 cities around the world on September 21st, 2012. Be the Change is the story in
images of diverse communities working together, regardless of their cultural,
social and racial differences, to collaborate in a global project.The
book is an archive of photographic and conceptual messages about
positive Change from thousands of citizens who believe in the power of art to
change the world.  Hundreds of acclaimed
and amateur photographers around the world donated their time to make this
project possible. The ephemeral nature of street art only allows us to record this
action in the format of a book to remain not only a source of inspiration, but also a testimony of a successful experience of global volunteer work dedicated
to positive Change.
Within this context, it
was natural to produce the book in-house with a team of amazing volunteers!!
The book is only available for purchase through our “Indiegogo” campaign from March 12th - May 11th!Be The Change
Project + PREVIOUS SUCCESS Following the success of our crowd-funding
campaign where we raised $18,000 to print and ship, 5,000 portrait-sized
posters on recycled paper; we are now publishing
this beautiful (A5) hardcover photography book to continue inspiring other communities to
live by example.The
ImpactThis book is important because it reminds the public that change begins
from within.  Our hope it that it will
make citizens aware of their
responsibilities and capacity to contribute to the changing world and that together, we can make a difference and be
the change.  FEEL GREAT by Being A Giver,
Tweet, Post, Shout it out!We invite you to at least give $5 to this campaign
and also we'd love to encourage you to Tweet, Facebook post, Instagram, and
email this campaign to your friends and followers. That is a BIG way to help!
Use the share tools right here on the site. About Be the ChangeBe the Change is a participatory art project uniting 15 countries and 26
cities around the world, which aims to visually share the stories of those who believe
in change and living by example a more sustainable life, with respect for their
natural and human environment. 
The Inside Out Project began with a wish by TED prize winner, JR, “to
turn the world inside out”. Inside Out Project is a collaboration between TED
Talks & French street artist, JR, which began in March 2011. It is a
global, large-scale participatory art project, driven by the purpose of
transforming messages of personal identity into artistic works. Inside Out aims
to give anyone and everyone a voice through his or her image. Black and white
photographic portraits are pasted in the streets of cities around the world,
revealing and sharing the untold stories of everyday people. More on the Inside
Out Project here.
Since JR’s initial project launched, the concept grew and 15 countries
around the world decided to unite and simultaneously paste 5,000 portraits in
the streets of their cities to draw attention to one issue: climate change.
Thus the new action ‘Inside Out Project | Be the Change’ was born.
The action was born from the realization that climate change is not just
about global warming, but about the human stories that unite us as world
citizens. The global concept is about bringing people together from different
fields, backgrounds and interests to create a unified message, which comes
directly from the people for the people. Now more than ever, we have a
responsibility to share our hopes and dreams in order to inspire real change.
BE THE CHANGE is the biggest and only multi-national action within
the Inside Out Project to date, with the Inside Out Group Action leaders from
Athens, Greece and Juarez, Mexico coordinating the project, globally. The 26 cities in 15 countries
participating in BTC are Alamata (Ethiopia), Athens (Greece), Austin (Texas), Aveiro (Portugal), Bandung (Indonesia), Brisbane, Cairns, Melbourne, Sydney
and Woodford (Australia), Casablanca (Morocco), Juarez & DF (Mexico), Lima (Peru), Madrid (Spain), Mulhouse (France), New York (NY), Nicosia (Cyprus), Santiago (Chile), Seoul (South Korea) and Tunis (Tunisia).

El Proyecto
INSIDE OUT es una iniciativa por el artista JR, ganador del premio TED
2011 y es un proyecto global de arte participativo que transforma los mensajes
de identidad personal en piezas de trabajo artístico. El reto consiste en
utilizar retratos fotográficos en blanco y negro para descubrir, revelar y
compartir los rostros de personas e historias que no han sido contadas
alrededor del mundo. Éstas imágenes digitales se envían a las oficinas
centrales donde se imprimen en formato de póster y se envían a los creadores
del proyecto para que las exhiban en en sus comunidades. Las imagenes pueden
ser instaladas en diferentes lugares, desde una imagen en una ventana a cientos
de imagenes en un edificio abandonado o un estadio Estas intervenciones serán
documentadas, archivadas y estarán disponibles para ser vistas virtualmente.
Desde el
proyecto inicial de JR lanzado, el concepto creció y 15 países alrededor del
mundo decididieron unirse y pegar
simultáneamente 5.000 retratos en las calles de sus ciudades respectivas para lanzar
mensajes sobre: cambio del clima. Así el nuevo interior del `de la acción hacia
fuera proyecta | Sea el cambio' fue llevado. La acción fue llevada de la
realización que el cambio el cambio cliamtico; un cambiono que no solamente
habla sobre el alietamiento global, pero tambien sobre las historias humanas
que nos unen como ciudadanos del mundo. El concepto global trata de unir a
gente de diversos campos, fondos e
intereses a crear un mensaje unificado, que viene directamente de la gente para
la gente. Ahora más que nunca, tenemos la responsabilidad de compartir nuestras
esperanzas y sueños para inspirar un cambio verdadero.

acción multinacional hasta la fecha, estas son las 26 ciudades y 15 paises

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Forest For The Trees is a non-profit project dedicated to the creation of contemporary public art. The project brings together local and international artists in a collaborative setting and provides them with the creative freedom and resources to create lasting works in environments that are freely accessible in the Portland community. The organization aims to improve the visual landscape of the city through quality artwork, and to provide opportunities to the creative community to participate in establishing Portland’s visual identity. Furthermore, the organization educates the public on the artwork, intent and process through workshops, panel discussions and classes.</span></p>
<p>This August, we intend to further our organization’s goals by providing new artists with more opportunities to create both murals and three-dimensional installation works in the public realm. During the week of August 24th, 30 artists will be provided the locations, equipment, materials and support necessary to realize their creative visions. In the last two years, Forest For The Trees has been behind the creation of 35 new murals in various neighborhoods around Portland, almost entirely created within two weeklong painting sessions. These murals have become landmarks that are embraced by the local community and visitors alike, contributing to Portland’s reputation as a creative cultural destination.</p>
<p>Artists play a powerful role in building the culture of a city, and by allowing artists to present their work in highly visible public environments we are cementing their value in our culture. Not only does this project create a local identity through the work of Portland’s art community, but also connects us to a larger global community. Visiting artists come from Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Cambodia, China, Germany, Japan, Kazakhstan, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Russia, South Africa and the UK, as well as various US cities and Native Reservations. The mixing of local and visiting artists has allowed for a greater diversity of work and sharing of ideas that enrich the Portland culture. It also broadens the exposure and opportunities for local artists to further develop their careers before a global audience, thus contributing to Portland’s stature as an international creative hub.  </p>
<p>This project has shown that with your support we can offer the right mix of resources and creative freedom to allow artists to impact the visual culture of Portland.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We've set the funding goal of $10K here, but we could definitely use more to make this even bigger and better. This is a shoestring budget for the amount and scale of the artwork we produce, but costs still add up. The money goes directly towards paint, equipment, materials and permits needed to create these pieces, as well as travel and lodging. The artists and organizers are donating their time in order to bring this to life. Plus, with the help of local grants that match our funding, every dollar you give is worth twice the value.</p>
<p>We have some exciting new rewards we are offering, including prints from AJ Fosik, Josh Keyes and Troy Lovegates, a 10-course dinner by chef Gregory Gourdet, Artist discussion panels at PNCA and Portland Art Museum, Artist led workshops, Coava Coffee and FFTT mugs, as well as new hats and tees!</p>
<p>This is our third year now, and each Summer we've learned how to make a bigger impact than the last. There are many challenges, but we know how to navigate those so that they do not become risks. If we do not reach our entire goal, we will still use the money we've raised to go as far as it can to create some new amazing work in Portland. If we do reach our goals, it will be an awesome Summer :)</p>

After graduating from Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, he moved to Los Angeles where he lived and worked for ten years before re-locating to Portland OR, where he is currently based. Salazar’s artwork transports the viewer into a vibrant and endless world of overlapping narratives and dreamscapes— half-remembered, half-imagined places “where stories can develop and take on a life of their own.”  Utilizing a wide variety of freely mixed media, found objects and layers of assemblage, his work evokes the wonders and imagination that many of us abandoned in childhood. Salazar often exhibits his collages, paintings, drawings and sculptures in dense and frenzied installations that encourage exploration and discovery. </i></i></p></span></h3>

Enriched by a steady diet of youtube videos and intense research I taught myself to sculpt and made a small army of bipedal animals wearing clothes.

Imbuing his vision with the divine symbolism of religious myths, worldly folklore and current social dynamics, his works contain a kind of shamanic exploration of meaning that recognizes the totemic quality and power of the image. With extensive experience within the design world, including working as a designer for Felt Bicycles and acting art director for Zero+ Publishing, Fontana’s work displays a virtuosic understanding of sign &amp; simulacra and their role within our contemporary visual culture. Straddling the physical and metaphysical, organic and architectural, painterly and graphic sensibilities, Fontana fuses multiple visual strategies to forge an aesthetic language entirely of his own making.<p></p>Blaine Fontana received his BFA in Communication Art/Design from Otis College of Art and Design in Los Angeles, CA in 2002.

</div></div>","Forest For The Trees is a non-profit project dedicated to the creation of contemporary public art. The project brings together local and international artists in a collaborative setting and provides them with the creative freedom and resources to create lasting works in environments that are freely accessible in the Portland community. The organization aims to improve the visual landscape of the city through quality artwork, and to provide opportunities to the creative community to participate in establishing Portland’s visual identity. Furthermore, the organization educates the public on the artwork, intent and process through workshops, panel discussions and classes.
This August, we intend to further our organization’s goals by providing new artists with more opportunities to create both murals and three-dimensional installation works in the public realm. During the week of August 24th, 30 artists will be provided the locations, equipment, materials and support necessary to realize their creative visions. In the last two years, Forest For The Trees has been behind the creation of 35 new murals in various neighborhoods around Portland, almost entirely created within two weeklong painting sessions. These murals have become landmarks that are embraced by the local community and visitors alike, contributing to Portland’s reputation as a creative cultural destination.
Artists play a powerful role in building the culture of a city, and by allowing artists to present their work in highly visible public environments we are cementing their value in our culture. Not only does this project create a local identity through the work of Portland’s art community, but also connects us to a larger global community. Visiting artists come from Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Cambodia, China, Germany, Japan, Kazakhstan, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Russia, South Africa and the UK, as well as various US cities and Native Reservations. The mixing of local and visiting artists has allowed for a greater diversity of work and sharing of ideas that enrich the Portland culture. It also broadens the exposure and opportunities for local artists to further develop their careers before a global audience, thus contributing to Portland’s stature as an international creative hub.  
This project has shown that with your support we can offer the right mix of resources and creative freedom to allow artists to impact the visual culture of Portland.

What We Need & What You Get We've set the funding goal of $10K here, but we could definitely use more to make this even bigger and better. This is a shoestring budget for the amount and scale of the artwork we produce, but costs still add up. The money goes directly towards paint, equipment, materials and permits needed to create these pieces, as well as travel and lodging. The artists and organizers are donating their time in order to bring this to life. Plus, with the help of local grants that match our funding, every dollar you give is worth twice the value.
We have some exciting new rewards we are offering, including prints from AJ Fosik, Josh Keyes and Troy Lovegates, a 10-course dinner by chef Gregory Gourdet, Artist discussion panels at PNCA and Portland Art Museum, Artist led workshops, Coava Coffee and FFTT mugs, as well as new hats and tees!
This is our third year now, and each Summer we've learned how to make a bigger impact than the last. There are many challenges, but we know how to navigate those so that they do not become risks. If we do not reach our entire goal, we will still use the money we've raised to go as far as it can to create some new amazing work in Portland. If we do reach our goals, it will be an awesome Summer :)

ARTIST PANEL SESSIONS:August 29
SOUTHER SALAZAR:Souther Salazar was born in 1978 in Hayward, CA. In the early 1990s, as a teenager in rural Oakdale, Salazar made photocopied cut-and-paste mini-comics and ‘zines. After graduating from Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, he moved to Los Angeles where he lived and worked for ten years before re-locating to Portland OR, where he is currently based. Salazar’s artwork transports the viewer into a vibrant and endless world of overlapping narratives and dreamscapes— half-remembered, half-imagined places “where stories can develop and take on a life of their own.”  Utilizing a wide variety of freely mixed media, found objects and layers of assemblage, his work evokes the wonders and imagination that many of us abandoned in childhood. Salazar often exhibits his collages, paintings, drawings and sculptures in dense and frenzied installations that encourage exploration and discovery. 

MARYANNA HOGGATT:In 1981 I was born on a naval base in the Philippine islands. For well over a decade my family hopscotched back to the US where we finally settled in Arizona. In 2007 I managed to escape the desert before I was baked alive and chased down my art school dreams in rainy Portland, Oregon. Later I decided art school wasn’t my ticket and entered a period I like to call The Great Lull.

In 2013 I procured a tiny vial of magic potion from a creepy old witch lurking in a dark cobblestone alleyway. The cost of my soul was an exceptional bargain. After imbibing the glowing confetti colored syrup I removed the bar towel from my back pocket and quit my bartending job, running all the way home to immediately start painting. Enriched by a steady diet of youtube videos and intense research I taught myself to sculpt and made a small army of bipedal animals wearing clothes. Initially I had sought the career of an Artist because I thought it would be a great excuse to rise around noon each day, but instead I became something of a Morning Person and am now enslaved by the army I myself created.

JOHN GOURLEY:John Gourley is an Alaskan who grew up “off the grid” whose best friends were dogs and his sketch pad.  His companions of wildlife, northern lights, silence and whatever sci-fi videotapes he could get his hands on inspired his early art and remain a consistent theme today. As a child, in Wasilla, he was prohibitively introverted; he claims that his bandmates forced the lead-singer job on him when Portugal the Man formed, in 2005. Seven records and a decade later, Gourley seems to have settled into his role. John currently lives in Portland with his girlfriend and baby daughter and stacks upon stacks of unfinished art.

YOSKAY YAMAMOTO:Born and raised in Toba, Japan, Yoskay Yamamoto moved to the United States at the
age of 15. A self-trained illustrator, Yamamoto's artistic tastes expanded as he
fell in love with the urban culture of the West coast. Yamamoto discovered a way
to fuse the two different cultural backgrounds together into his work. Yamamoto
nostalgically blends pop iconic characters from his new Western home with traditional
and mythical Japanese elements, balancing his Asian heritage with urban
pop art.


BRENDAN MONROE:Currently I live and work in Oakland, California with my wife Evah and our cat Jalapeño. Once in a while I take on illustration commissions, but most of the time I paint and sculpt for exhibitions. I think it’s important to constantly challenge oneself with new ideas and new mediums. My interpretations of the world are mostly rooted in science then executed through painting and sculpting. These are the best ways for me to communicate, but I always enjoy making other things as well.

MARY IVERSON:“She’s climbed up the leg of a crane to research her paintings’ subjects, the perspective lines drawn with a sharp blade. A true explorer, she sets up camp in the northwestern wilderness, searching for the perfect landscape to destroy in the nearly non-fictional, post-apocalyptic story she’s telling.”
-Kristin Farr, Juxtapoz Magazine

ANDREW HEM:Born during his parents' flight from Cambodia in the wake of the Khmer Rouge genocide, Andrew Hem grew up poised in the balance between two cultures — the rural animistic society of his Khmer ancestors, and the dynamic urban arts of the tough Los Angeles neighborhood where his family eventually came to rest. Fascinated by graffiti at an early age, he honed his skills with graphics and composition on the walls of the city before following a passion for figure drawing to a degree in illustration from Art Center College of Design. Working in gouache, oil and acrylic, he weaves atmospheric, richly textured narratives in a vivid palette of twilight blues enlivened by swaths of deep red and splashes of golden light. His haunting impressions of culture and landscape evoke the life of the spirit through the visionary manifestation of memories and dreams.
AJ FOSIK:“Fosik’s feral creations take the shape of fantastic beings that communicate a subversive, anti-religious commentary through the depiction of hyperbolized fictional gods. Nameless, ​assigned no specific meanings or powers, beholden to no formal faith—real or contrived—Fosik’s idols are not meant to contribute to some grand theological narrative of the artist’s design. They are masterfully made beautiful objects that examine the nature of spiritual iconography through an absence of religious discourse. In this way, Fosik points to the power and scope of man’s innate creativity devoid of divine inspiration.” – Lainya Magana, ​​Hi-Fructose


JOSH KEYES:Born in 1969 in Tacoma Washington.  Josh Keyes received his BFA in 1992 from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and an MFA in 1998 from Yale University School of Art.  He has exhibited his work nationally and internationally and has work in private and public collections. Keyes currently lives and works in Portland Oregon with his wife and artist Lisa Ericson.
Inspired by 18th and 19th-century aesthetics and philosophy, Josh Keyes paints animals in a style reminiscent of anatomical diagrams. His work is characterized by an attention to detail and to physiological accuracy. Keyes, however, does not place his animal subjects in their natural settings; rather, they are often in peril, displaced from their natural ecosystems into dioramic fantastical situations. These landscapes are frequently isolated and contain an incompatible mix of the natural and manmade. Keyes acknowledges that themes of migration and displacement frequently feature into his work as a form of his preoccupation with global climate change and the human impact on nature. 



J.SHEA:Born in Boston, MA and based in Porltand, OR Shea creates mixed media sculptures out of small discarded gadgets and lost cultural icons. These assembled parts are fused together with hand sculpted figures and animal forms carved out of clay and wood modeling mediums. Imbuing them with a sense of adaptability, transience and animism as they are pulled out of context, repurposed and recontextualized.

In this way, Fosik points to the power and scope of man’s innate creativity devoid of divine inspiration.” – Lainya Magana, ​​Hi-Fructose
BLAINE FONTANA:
Blaine Fontana currently lives and works in Portland, Oregon. Imbuing his vision with the divine symbolism of religious myths, worldly folklore and current social dynamics, his works contain a kind of shamanic exploration of meaning that recognizes the totemic quality and power of the image. With extensive experience within the design world, including working as a designer for Felt Bicycles and acting art director for Zero+ Publishing, Fontana’s work displays a virtuosic understanding of sign & simulacra and their role within our contemporary visual culture. Straddling the physical and metaphysical, organic and architectural, painterly and graphic sensibilities, Fontana fuses multiple visual strategies to forge an aesthetic language entirely of his own making.Blaine Fontana received his BFA in Communication Art/Design from Otis College of Art and Design in Los Angeles, CA in 2002. He was awarded “Best in Show” for his senior thesis project, and is one of only seven distinguished alumni from 2000-2010. He is currently an Advisory Board member for the Northwest College of Art.

<h3><strong>Hello!</strong></h3>
<span style=""font-size: 10px;"">I'm an independent artist and graphic novelist, currently earning a bachelor's degree in Mathematics and funding my schooling with my artwork. As my college life becomes more and more demanding, I have a greater need for portable art tools and my laptop isn't cutting it so well anymore. Unfortunately, I'm having trouble raising the money for new tools on my own. What I want is a Yiynova Tablet Monitor, a device that would allow me to work directly onto the screen. The Yiynova isn't as expensive as the more famous Wacom Cintiq, but it's still not something I can afford.</span>

</div></div>","Hello!
I'm an independent artist and graphic novelist, currently earning a bachelor's degree in Mathematics and funding my schooling with my artwork. As my college life becomes more and more demanding, I have a greater need for portable art tools and my laptop isn't cutting it so well anymore. Unfortunately, I'm having trouble raising the money for new tools on my own. What I want is a Yiynova Tablet Monitor, a device that would allow me to work directly onto the screen. The Yiynova isn't as expensive as the more famous Wacom Cintiq, but it's still not something I can afford.
 
That's where you come in.


What I Need & What You Get
This project will raise exactly the cost of the tablet plus shipping to the US. See for yourself. In return, you will receive custom artwork made with my spiffy new tablet. You can see examples of my artwork at: http://cassiethomas.deviantart.com or http://theworldisyours.smackjeeves.com

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Stephanie Piña, I am a chair member of The Liberal Arts Council at The University of Texas at Austin. I am a third year Government and International Relations student. Below is our proposition and our goal.</p>
<p>The Liberal Arts Council, the official student voice of the Liberal Arts students at the University of Texas at Austin, has pledged efforts for the Spring 2013 semester to raising money for a local Austin charity. The charity we have chosen is Casa Marianella, and emergency sherlter for recent adult immigratns to the United States. Casa provides housing and food for up to 35 immigrants, English classes, and a shelter for women and children escaping violent situations, among others. This charity is very worthy and in need of your support so that the Austin area may provide more support for recent immigrants, helping them acess resources and education. Casa Marianella's website is: <a href=""http://www.casamarianella.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.casamarianella.org/</a></p>
<p>This year, my committee, Campus and Community Focus, along with our council (LAC) has decided to take on the philantrophic initiative of fundraising for a local charity in Austin, TX. As a council we voted and decided it would be of most fitting to fundraise for Casa Marianella. Casa Marianella is an emergency homeless shelter that has served recently-arrived men and women immigrants, seekers for asylum for over 26 years in the East Austin area. This organization means much for Liberal Arts Council. We have faculty who serve on their board, we have members who have volunteered for Casa Marianella, and we really value and appreciate the work Casa has done for the Austin community. </p>
<p>Raising this amount of money won't only help Casa Marianella, but it will also silence our challengers. Besides challenging ourselves to raise $5,000 we have a few Council members who have challenged my committee by proposing to shave their heads, go complete bald if my council, succeeds in funding this amount of money. These individuals are three council members who decided to make our initiative a bit interesting and we simply cannot lose, the satisfaction from seeing them go bald will be pretty amazing to all of council. But more so, because we were able to cross the finish line, reach our goal, and prove the skeptics wrong. We need your help! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise $5,000. This money will be fully donated to Casa Marianella. We wish to have this amount by the end of the school semester where we will then introduce Casa Marianella with a big fat check that will help them provide the individuals they aid with food, blankets, extra clothing, shoes, and for all other miscellaneous activities for which they need funding.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is valuable to council in so many different ways and its extremely valuable to me and those who have volunteered in the past and those who have worked for Casa Marianella. It's near to our hearts and we would appreciate any dollar to be donated to us.</p>

<h3>Where They're Going</h3>
<p>How many of us know in the depths of our being that Jennifer McAfee is gonna make it to the big screen?</p>
<p>I sure do, and I'm guessing if you're here, you do too.</p>
<p>Jenney's been acting for God knows how long, but without the encouragement of her ultimately supporting husband, Noah, it's not likely she'd be making the life-altering leap toward stardom. </p>
<p>Having been settled in Chico, CA for years, Jenney and Noah Herbold's network of friends and family is the backbone to their blissful, joy-filled lives.</p>
<p>But passion is a funny thing.</p>
<p>While comfort and security, as well as support and community, create the platform for a satisfying and pleasurable existence, they can't be enough for someone whose conduit for fulfilling her sense of purpose dwells miles away, in a far-off land known as Los Angeles.</p>
<p>As Noah recognized that Jenney's goals were larger than what Chico could offer, Jenney too had this bittersweet epiphany. </p>
<p>Together, it became apparent that life was about to drastically change. And together, they've taken step after step toward realizing what is now an equally shared dream. </p>
<p>Piece by piece things have fallen into place, almost as if the Universe is intentionally collaborating with their efforts to get Jennifer McAfee on the big screen. </p>
<p>Now, it's our turn to help.</p>
<p>Contributing to assisting the Herbolds make their move to Long Beach does so much more than merely get them from point A to point B—it supports the dreams and future reality of this amazing family's journey toward living a life full of passion and purpose, risk and adventure, and ultimately, unbounded joy. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What They Need (And What You Get!)</h3>
<p>The family of four—Jenney, Noah, Tori, and Jeffery—are moving. They're going. They're already gone. But not quite. </p>
<p>These incredible people need help paying for the move. U-hauls, gas, food, and animal accommodations add up, and it's going to take a pretty penny to get them to realize their dream. </p>
<p>The thing is, this tightly-knit friend-family they have here in Chico got together and cooked up a plan to help them on their way. This plan includes a donation from you. And in turn, you will receive a nifty gift for your generous contribution. </p>
<p>Ever wanna take a body shot off one of those fine Herbold specimens? Or perhaps receive a signed 8 x 10 black and white photo of Jennifer McAfee sealed with a kiss? Maybe you're more practical and have seen those snazzy <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/chicochicaclothes?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Chico Chica fb page"">CHICO CHICA</a> tank tops floating around the internet and have been dying to get your hands on one. Or maybe it's a credit with <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Artwork-by-Caitlin/118205698201650?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Artwork by Caitlin fb page"">Artwork by Caitlin</a> Schwerin that tickles your fancy? (Many of these perks can be redeemed directly at the farewell party on Saturday, June 29th.)</p>
<p>Of course, whatever this campaign receives in donations will directly benefit the move of the Herbold family. Anything and everything goes to them. So you can be sure that your contribution will fund the path that ultimately lands Jennifer McAfee in line with her dream, and the family in line with their new, exciting lives in Los Angeles. </p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Other Ways You Can Help</span></strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>If offering even $5 is just too much for you at this point there are still plenty of ways you can help:</p>
<p>Have stuff you want to get rid of? Bring it to the fundraising Yard Sale on Saturday, June 29 from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. All profits go toward helping the Herbolds move. </p>
<p>By using the Indiegogo share tools you can get the word out and make some noise about this campaign. But remember to use your indoor voices, as this undercover mission isn't to be revealed until the good-bye party on the night of Sat., June 29th.

historical and contemporary importance, in many cultures bread has a 
significance beyond mere nutrition. 
The Roman poet Juvenal satirised superficial politicians and the public 
as caring only for ""panem et circenses"" (bread and circuses). In Israel

for basic necessities and living conditions in general. In India, life's
 basic necessities are often referred to as ""roti, kapra aur makan"" 
(bread, cloth and house). Since bread has this significance of 
necessity, we ask  to our contributors to report what is their daily 
bread. </span><font size=""4""><b><br/><br/><span style=""color: rgb(102, 51, 204);"">Why should I fund you?</span></b></font><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">To

As editorial staff, we usually contact young artists, involving them in a free collaboration, but we often consider also many spontaneous submissions. For now we’ve published works from more than 1000 artists from the four corner of the world. TMM is present on many social networks, which carry additional content, enriching and deepening the magazine itself.The strength of trust me is to give equal visibility to different artistic realities, to bring together many different points of view of people who otherwise would never meet.For now, Trust Me is a small project, but due to its simplicity and strong connectivity is expanding rapidly, overcoming territorial, linguistic and cultural boundaries. For that reason we are planning to introduce in the next issues different topics stronger related to social, documentaristic and environmental issues, that can stimulate a more complex conversation among contributors.The next goals of the magazine are: the print publication, the distribution in specific sites as gallery and bookshops and the development of a stranger and more interactive web platforms.




The Impact
Money
 raised through Indiegogo will go directly to building the 
infrastructure of the magazine to make it a sustainable venture. All the funds goal will directly allow us to set up an advertising/accounting department, 
purchase relevant software and supplies, and cover printing costs. This 
may not sound sexy, but this is the backbone we need to expand the 
creativity and reach of the magazine. The Project
Trust me #5 will be about BREAD.During the past two years this magazine is leavened like a dough left 
next to the oven: new people, new ideas, new topics. So let’s celebrate 
one of the most basic foods in the world. What is bread? At its simplest
 it is merely a paste of flour or meal and water cooked over or 
surrounded by heat. Bread is a great source of energy. The dough is soft
 and unformed, which anyone can give the shape he wants. It is 
widely believed that the domestication and cultivation of wheat and 
other grains directly influenced human transition from nomadic people to
 domesticated, stationary people. Bread is a foodstuff of great 
historical and contemporary importance, in many cultures bread has a 
significance beyond mere nutrition. 
The Roman poet Juvenal satirised superficial politicians and the public 
as caring only for ""panem et circenses"" (bread and circuses). In Israel 
the most usual phrase in work-related demonstrations is ""lekhem, avoda"" 
(bread, work). In Cockney rhyming slang, bread means money. The 
cultural importance of bread goes beyond slang to serve as a metaphor 
for basic necessities and living conditions in general. In India, life's
 basic necessities are often referred to as ""roti, kapra aur makan"" 
(bread, cloth and house). Since bread has this significance of 
necessity, we ask  to our contributors to report what is their daily 
bread. Why should I fund you?To
 move Trust Me Mag forward, editors and contributors will continue to scour
 the globe for individuals, organizations, and regions buzzing with 
enterprising spirit. But to do this, we need…money!!
Thus
 far, Trust Me Magazine has been produced on a shoestring. We wanted to prove we
 could produce something from nothing before moving forward. Thus
 far we hustled some money together, worked lots of late nights. But, with a little financial backing, we can take this
 progress leaps and bounds forwards.
The next issue, for wich we are asking your help, will be ""The Bread issue"".
Our dads always told us that we must not trifle with food. Certainly for
 most of us, bread is a good at our fingertips but not for everybody. So
 we want to support the important projects of FAO about food. We will 
devolve the 10% of the proceeds to these initiatives : https://getinvolved-donate.fao.org/supporter/donationforms.do?n=F6@5Cs
Should I keep funding you after you meet your goal?
Yes!
 Any money above that will go towards other much needed areas of 
expansion. This includes researching and writing grants, distributing 
issues to partners in the developing world, building out our new 
website, expanding our outreach, increasing our editorial staff.

of artist-augur Lynn Nessethâ€™s â€˜Divination Series,â€™ is a conceptual artwork
collaborating the psychic and photographic craft of thirteen artists.  This piece was channeled through inspiration for Black Mountain College Museum's event the 2012 {RE}HAPPENING.  Nesseth and the appointed twelve artists, pictured
below, are using consecrated single-shot disposable â€œFortune Camerasâ€ as
mediums for evidencing prophetic images of their lives.  The pictures now being taken will be laid
into spreads; each individual photograph acting as a card with its own fortune.  Twelve pairs of two compose each roll of 24
exposures, signifying binary aspects of the twelve Astrological Signs.  Each photograph is contextualized into a
realm of the artistâ€™s life by its placement into its corresponding Astrological
House, or life field, based on the artistâ€™s time of birth.  Adherent to American â€œpop-ritualâ€, each
fortune will be tagged with phrases relative to aspects of each House via â€œin
bedâ€ or â€œin my unions.â€ 


 

In essence, the spread provides a reading of
each individual artistâ€™s Natal Birth Chart; the first pair of photographs corresponding
with the artistâ€™s Ascendant or Rising Sign.  The spread was divined by Nesseth while walking
in the forest carrying a single-shot disposable camera under a sun in Scorpio,
a moon transitioning from Pisces into Aries at 2:02pm conjunct Uranus and the
influence of divinatory psychotropics.  In this divined system, the unknown is
harnessed through the artistsâ€™ intuitive choices for content and composition
within their imagery.  The most revealing
indication of meaning will be foremost the artistsâ€™ feelings and intuitive
impressions when regarding a given subject within the spread.  The entire collection of images from all
twelve rolls of film will be installed within a grand binary configuration of
the spreads.  Adjunct to the
installation, archetypal portraits are being taken of the inspired twelve.  Each artist will be gifted an album
containing and documenting their personal divinatory reading.

<p>‘Apollo VII – XVII: A collection of photographs taken by NASA’s Apollo program astronauts 1968 – 1972’ is a photography book that revisits the iconic images taken by the astronauts of NASA’s Apollo program between 1968 and 1972.</p>
<p>The book is introduced with an essay written by Apollo 7 astronaut Walt Cunningham, sharing his memories and stories on early space exploration photography from the Apollo program.</p>
<p>Photography has become a crucial technique for documenting the history of mankind. The early exploration of space is one such historical event, unrivalled among humanity’s achievements. Fortunately, the skill and daring of a very particular group of ‘photographers’, the Apollo astronauts, were able to bring back beautiful, moving and instantly recognizable images. It is these images that created a new understanding to what it means to be human, living on this planet and its relation to the sun and the stars.</p>
<p>This book presents 225 of these photographs in large print format. Bringing them to life and restoring the color from the original scans of 70mm film the astronauts shot during their missions. An additional chapter at the back of the book gives background information on the photographic equipment and the training and technique the astronauts undertook in order to create these beautiful images using modified Hasselblad 70mm film cameras they were given to use on board.</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>There are always risks and challenges with such an ambitious project as this. However, within our small team we have the necessary expertise and skills to produce this book to the very highest standards. Our international team consists of creatives and graphic designers that work together at an agency where we produce books and edit photographs all the time.</p>
<p>We can also draw a lot of learnings from one of the team members previous crowdfunding projects (<a href=""https://goo.gl/EC6GVh"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://goo.gl/EC6GVh</a>) where we learnt the ins and outs of publishing and shipping the book worldwide.</p>
<p>We have set ourselves a comfortable timeframe to produce the book in order to make sure the project isn’t rushed and is given the time and attention that it needs. This will hopefully allow us to maintain our proposed shipping date. We will use tried &amp; trusted shipping methods to send the book and also adequately protect the book with a custom made shipping carton to make sure you receive the book in perfect order.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The great thing about this project is that the work is already done and out there,this is purely a presale platform to fund printing and shipping costs.</p>
<p>Over the years I have been asked if I would sell prints etc of the work I produced and until now I have avoided it, but what better way I thought of getting it into peoples hands than a collected album of some of my best and better known pieces.</p>
<p>This will be a limited run, so each copy will be hand signed and numbered.. dependant on  how many sell during this campaign</p>
<p>There will be a choice of a trade 8/10 hardback or soft cover issue to suit budget, introductions by Jorg Buttgereit, Scott Schirmer and Phil Stevens.. where the original work was produced in full colour, that glorious bloody colour will be reprinted here.. also on offer will be a few of my original pieces.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In the great tradition of Movie cover art books this works as a snapshot in time, a nostalgic look back at when cover art was paramount to impulse viewers to check out a movie or project.. unlike the mainstream movie market the underground scene is very small and very loyal and much of this work ( other than the arrow video pieces) is only seen by a hand few of us.</p>
<p>This is not merely a vanity project on my part, I want this book to capture this time when the indie movement ballooned and beautiful art was produced ( and sadly some unproduced!) by an under appreciated few.</p>

</div></div>","Our Story 
Hi our names are Vaan Manoukian and Lana Sokoloff  and we are painters from Los Angeles, California
We have both received an honorable invitation to exhibit at the Biennale in the historical Fortezza da Basso in Florence, Italy this December. 
The Impact 
The Biennale is the most prestigious art exposition in the world, and is recognized by the  United Nations as an official partner in their program“Dialogue Among Civilizations”. Invitations are limited and given specifically to artists around the world to represent their country with different ethnic, linguistic and religious traditions. 
 
 Artists at the exhibition will compete on behalf of their nation for the ‘Lorenzo the Magnificent” career prize, which is one of the most prestigious honors in the world, a prize that was previously bestowed on world-renowned artists such as David Hokney. 
So as you can imagine, it is a huge honor and responsibility to be asked to participate as an ambassador for the United States. But it’s also very expensive. 
 
What We Need  
Entrance fees alone cost $4,500 dollars per artist, plus, when you factor in roundtrip airfare $1,200, hotels and travelling expenses like hotel around $150 a day and food, all these  really start to add up. Which is why we’ve turned to indiegogo for help. We’re reaching out to you to help us raise our goal of $16,000 to send the two of us to represent America in the exposition and compete for the award. We only have 60 days to reach our goal, so every little bit you give will help us on our way to achieving this dream.
  
What You Get
 
We’ve created a number of rewards for anyone who donates to our cause, such as postcards and signed limited edition prints from both Lana and Vaan.  Those who contribute over 1,000 will be listed as a sponsor in the Beniale catalogue. 
 
 Other Ways You Can Help
We hope you take the time to look at our rewards and give to what we think, is a really great cause. This is truly a once in a lifetime opportunity that is not to be missed, so any and all contributions, big and small, are greatly appreciated.

<p>My name is Chris Walstad.  I’m a 24-year-old fine-art photographer with a passion for the world.  I’ve been doing photography professionally for 7 years.  In the future, I plan to take my talents into a community college classroom, and share my passion for photography with the youth of tomorrow. My community college photography professor changed how I see the world, and ultimately changed my life.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 90px;"">      <img alt=""morro"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img837.imageshack.us/img837/6426/camerag.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""camera""/></p>
<p>In 2010, I had the privilege to travel across the Pacific Ocean to Okinawa, Japan.  I stayed abroad for a little less than 3 months; it was one of the most revealing experiences of my life.  In the two years since my return, my soul has longed for Asia. And the photographic opportunities that still await me there. Up until a few months ago I had almost written off my dream of traveling the Far East.  But when a few friends offered to be traveling partners, it re-kindled the fire inside my heart. As our departure in January draws closer, and the plans begin to solidify, the only stumbling block in my way is money. I’ve set a goal to get 100, forty-dollar donations, if I reach my goal that leaves me with $3,720.  These donations will not only help me with the expenses of the trip, but they will promote art, and allow our team to fulfill a longtime dream.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""> <img alt=""kids"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img526.imageshack.us/img526/6302/kidsq.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""kids""/></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>The trip will last for 100 days; the team and I will start in Hanoi and head south, zigzaging through Vietnam and Laos.  We will end our southward journey in Ho Chi Minh City, and then shift gears heading north through Cambodia. Eventually we aim to end up in Thailand.  From here we will head south into Malaysia and ultimately the Indonesian Islands.  The entire journey will be traveled either by rail, bus, boat, or on foot.  We long to move as the natives do, to intermingle with the people of the region.  It is said that you cannot truly understand someone unless you’ve walked a mile in their shoes, we plan to seek out understanding.  This will not be a lavish trip with rated hotels or swanky restaurants; it will be an artistic adventure from the cheap seats.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 90px;""><img alt=""map"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img23.imageshack.us/img23/1496/mapofsoutheastasiaregio.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""map""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">      </p>
<p>It is my dream to travel, and create photographs that evoke real human emotion.  I want to connect people with a world they may never see in person, and put a dent in human ignorance.  I am a disciple of light, and a wanderer trying to capture it.  I am an advocate to young artists and their aspirations.  Today’s youth is our future, and I believe it would be folly to overlook art, simply based on the age of the artist.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">  <img alt=""pagota"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img193.imageshack.us/img193/5671/pagota.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""pagota""/>   <img alt=""golden"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img857.imageshack.us/img857/4852/goldenw.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""golden""/></p>
<p>Throughout the trip the team will carry cameras and/or journals to document our experiences.  After we return home, we will be putting together a book of our words and our photographs. The book will explore a region riddled with ancient cultures influenced by modern day ideals.  It will be dedicated to discovering the people of South East Asia, by seeking out their culture through photography.  This is a trip meant to document the travelers, the experiences, and the people we meet along the way; it is to be a trip of disclosure. I want to share our relationships with as many people as possible.  The ones we have, and the ones we have yet to encounter.  Thank you so much for your donations, prayers, and well wishes. Godspeed.  </p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What We Need </strong></p>
<p>If I am fortunate enough to reach my goal of $4,000 in donations, after the service fees, I will be left with $3,720 to fund the adventure, and offset printing and shipping costs for donator perks.</p>
<p>Airfare will cost about $1,100.00</p>
<p>Perks will cost me around $500.00 (This is my best guess)</p>
<p>After a subtracting $1,600 from $3,720, I will be left with $2,120, which equates to $21.20 a day for the duration of the trip.</p>
<p>If I don’t reach my goal the money will go towards the airfare first, and then I will attempt to finance the rest of the trip myself.</p>

<p> </p></div>","Short Summary
My name is Chris Walstad.  I’m a 24-year-old fine-art photographer with a passion for the world.  I’ve been doing photography professionally for 7 years.  In the future, I plan to take my talents into a community college classroom, and share my passion for photography with the youth of tomorrow. My community college photography professor changed how I see the world, and ultimately changed my life.
      
In 2010, I had the privilege to travel across the Pacific Ocean to Okinawa, Japan.  I stayed abroad for a little less than 3 months; it was one of the most revealing experiences of my life.  In the two years since my return, my soul has longed for Asia. And the photographic opportunities that still await me there. Up until a few months ago I had almost written off my dream of traveling the Far East.  But when a few friends offered to be traveling partners, it re-kindled the fire inside my heart. As our departure in January draws closer, and the plans begin to solidify, the only stumbling block in my way is money. I’ve set a goal to get 100, forty-dollar donations, if I reach my goal that leaves me with $3,720.  These donations will not only help me with the expenses of the trip, but they will promote art, and allow our team to fulfill a longtime dream.
 
 
The Impact
The trip will last for 100 days; the team and I will start in Hanoi and head south, zigzaging through Vietnam and Laos.  We will end our southward journey in Ho Chi Minh City, and then shift gears heading north through Cambodia. Eventually we aim to end up in Thailand.  From here we will head south into Malaysia and ultimately the Indonesian Islands.  The entire journey will be traveled either by rail, bus, boat, or on foot.  We long to move as the natives do, to intermingle with the people of the region.  It is said that you cannot truly understand someone unless you’ve walked a mile in their shoes, we plan to seek out understanding.  This will not be a lavish trip with rated hotels or swanky restaurants; it will be an artistic adventure from the cheap seats.
 

      
It is my dream to travel, and create photographs that evoke real human emotion.  I want to connect people with a world they may never see in person, and put a dent in human ignorance.  I am a disciple of light, and a wanderer trying to capture it.  I am an advocate to young artists and their aspirations.  Today’s youth is our future, and I believe it would be folly to overlook art, simply based on the age of the artist.
 
     
Throughout the trip the team will carry cameras and/or journals to document our experiences.  After we return home, we will be putting together a book of our words and our photographs. The book will explore a region riddled with ancient cultures influenced by modern day ideals.  It will be dedicated to discovering the people of South East Asia, by seeking out their culture through photography.  This is a trip meant to document the travelers, the experiences, and the people we meet along the way; it is to be a trip of disclosure. I want to share our relationships with as many people as possible.  The ones we have, and the ones we have yet to encounter.  Thank you so much for your donations, prayers, and well wishes. Godspeed.  

 
What We Need 
If I am fortunate enough to reach my goal of $4,000 in donations, after the service fees, I will be left with $3,720 to fund the adventure, and offset printing and shipping costs for donator perks.
Airfare will cost about $1,100.00
Perks will cost me around $500.00 (This is my best guess)
After a subtracting $1,600 from $3,720, I will be left with $2,120, which equates to $21.20 a day for the duration of the trip.
If I don’t reach my goal the money will go towards the airfare first, and then I will attempt to finance the rest of the trip myself.

What You Get

<h3>About Sylvia and Juliet</h3>
<p>Our names are Juliet Rothman and Sylvia Hölscher, we come from Sweden but hail from a multi-cultural upbringing. Spending much of our childhood and early adolescence in the far-flung corners of the globe, we finally ended up back home, Sweden, except we didn't know it as our home. Then slowly, the years passed, we went to school and learned to live what is commonly referred to here as, the ""Svensson"" life.</p>
<p>So here we are thinking, we got it all figured out! But in actuality, do we? We started asking ourselves now that we have come to that point in our lives where one chooses their personal place and path: What happens next? We began searching and realize that with all of our wandering around and finally finding home, there is still a void inside us, a longing to understand and to find out. Hence we have decided to venture out into the unknown!</p>
<p>We are both artistically inclined, not just in the way we like to make things beautiful but want to discover the world through our art. (We assure you our art is better than our writing skills!). Heres a little somethin something! Past art exhibition at Cybergymnasiet in Odenplan of some of our various art work and photography. </p>

<p>While thinking, discussing and planning we thought even though this is our inner journey it might be somewhat empty and limited if we were to discover it on our own. </p>
<p>We want to experience and partake of the lives of others not only appreciating their art, culture and cuisine but interact and listen to them and then; share their story to the world, you.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>And here is how we are going to do it!</h3>
<p>We will be documenting our entire journey through constant documentation such as videoing, photographs and interviews of the various people we will be meeting along our world journey and stream it live on our Facebook page for all to see and then share it through television (Swedish svt1), exhibitions, schools and seminars.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>And here is what we are going to do!</h3>
<p>Broadcast all the various people we meet whom will include, for example, <br/>the experiences of a 20 year old Masai in Masai Mara, What are his dreams and what is his impression of the world? The Tibetan family, how do they spend their day, what are their traditions and cuisine? The 18 year old at the refugee camp in Nairobi, who lost his parents while raising his brothers and sisters. How would he tell his story?</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our Project!</h3>
<p>Throughout our journey we will also be visiting youth centers, orphanages, refugee camps and creche where we will personally hold art classes with the children, photograph, video film and interview their stories.</p>
<p>Our ambition at the end of our journey is to hold exhibitions and seminars with photographs approximately 84x55 cm of the children, written interviews of their stories along with their art in Schools, The Stockholm Culture House and Art Fair. Our eventual plan with these exhibitions is to raise money for them by auctioning their artwork.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>On The Road</h3>
<p>Some of the places we will be visiting and documenting will include, spending a day and night with the Masai's in one of their 1000 tribes, meditating at the Buddha temple, experiencing rush hour in India. And we already have invitations from : Refugee camp in Nairobi, youth organizations 'Change the World', 'Siembamba creche' in Sir Lowry's Pass Village in South Africa and the center for underprivileged children in Bangkok,Thailand where our art project will take place. <br/><br/>On the 13th of December we will be leaving the comforts of our home in Stockholm, Sweden to Qatar then Kenya and passing through Rwanda while heading for South Africa, landing in Johannesburg and traveling down the coast heading west arriving in Cape Town. In February we will travel through India up to Tibet and from there venture out into Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand and finally, in June, returning back home to Sweden.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>With Your Support...</h3>
<p>We would be honored to receive your donation. Every contribution helps! Each penny goes a long way, and that penny might be just what we need for a live streaming interview of an advanced philosophical discussion with a dedicated Tibetan!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>At the moment all we have is an old laptop from 2007, which doesn't fulfill its purpose. Juliet's camera was recently stolen. And we have never had the honor of owning a video camera!</p>
<ul>
<li>Laptop - For storage, compilation, live streaming and broadcasting our journey straight to you!</li>
<li>Camera - To capture life's moments in one frame. For live streaming and exhibition use.</li>
<li>Videocamera - The largest insight for the people, a story with a voice. Will be used for interviews and documentation. (Plus a mic, clearly..)</li>
<li>Tickets - We already have enough for around 2/3 of the tickets! But lets be honest, the more money we get the more tickets we can purchase and the more places we are able to visit the more projects we are able to do.</li>
<li>Art Material - Art material for our far out art lessons with the kiddos! Shipment - Ship the children's art back to our storage in Sweden, pilling it up for our exclusive exhibition!</li>
<li>Exhibition - To fund an exhibition of photographs approximately 84x55 cm of the children along with their art and stories at ""Kulturhuset"" and ""Fotomässan"" in Stockholm once our journey is complete. Which in turn will serve as advertisement for their arts' auctioning.</li>

<h3>The Why? - Why are we doing this?</h3>
<p>Haiti was hit with a catastrophic 7.0 magnitude earthquake in January of 2010. Journey Community Church has been in relationship with a community in Carrefour Haiti since May of 2010. We have seen an abundance of artistic talent in our San Diego community, and we see immense skill in the people of Haiti.</p>
<p><strong>Our Vision</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>Utilizing the gifts and talents we have seen in our community to bring hope and offer opportunity to our family in Haiti. In doing so, we desire to align all included with their dignity and identity as an artist. We see this as a rare opportunity to show our partner community how much we believe in them, to create a feeling of empowerment, and to introduce further freedom of expression. Our hope is to take advantage of the lack of garbage system in Haiti as means for potential supplies.<strong><br/></strong></p>
<h3>The Who? - Who are we? Who are they?</h3>
<p>We are a group of passionate people who have fallen in love with the people of Haiti. We are artists (in one way or another). We are: Dani-Jo, Marina, Tiffany, and Summer, as well as 7 others from San Diego, California.</p>
<p>The Haitian artists that we will include in our time will be decided by the man Journey first made contact with in 2010. Pastor Edouard. He has the best understanding of the talents surrounding him as well as financial situations of the families of Carrefour, Haiti.</p>
<h3>The What? - What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To cover all of the costs we need roughly $20,000. I'll break it down for you.</p>
<p>Plane Tickets - Along with the four of us, we are taking 7 more artists from the San Diego area to Haiti with us.</p>
<p>Living Expenses - We will be eating rice and beans everyday, staying in a house with sporadic electricity, no hot water, and cots as beds; we are cutting living expenses to a minimum.</p>
<p>Transators - They do not speak English in Haiti</p>
<p>Transportation - We will have to take local Tap-taps (taxi trucks) and busses to buy supplies and such.</p>
<p>Supplies/Microloans - Not only do we need to buy initial supplies to work with and manipulate while we are there, we also need funding for microloans for those who have proven able to continue a business.</p>
<p>The more we get the more we can supply them. Any extra funds would go towards the haitian people in a number of ways: trips to/funding for medical clinics, rice and beans to many different communities, and any further needs we witness as we are down there ie - shoes, underwear, toothbrushes, etc. We will give every last penny to the Haitian people.</p>
<p>Even if you cannot contribute, spreading the word is dire for us to meet our goal. We are going to tell people as best as we can, but we need your help to reach people we wouldn't have been able to before!</p>

Supplies/Microloans - Not only do we need to buy initial supplies to work with and manipulate while we are there, we also need funding for microloans for those who have proven able to continue a business.
The more we get the more we can supply them. Any extra funds would go towards the haitian people in a number of ways: trips to/funding for medical clinics, rice and beans to many different communities, and any further needs we witness as we are down there ie - shoes, underwear, toothbrushes, etc. We will give every last penny to the Haitian people.
Even if you cannot contribute, spreading the word is dire for us to meet our goal. We are going to tell people as best as we can, but we need your help to reach people we wouldn't have been able to before!",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p> I am excited to announce that I have reached my goal in this campaign to fund printing the tarot deck I have been creating for the past four and a half years.  However my goal was less than actual printing costs and I am still looking for people who want to contribute to funding. I have found some excellent printers who will print 1000 good quality decks with a full color booklet in a lidded box. I am looking forward to offering Tarot de St. Croix in the spring. </p>
<p>Check out the perks to see what level of contribution you want to make. Be one of the first to receive the Tarot de St. Croix deck. Choose a fine art archival print of the card of your choice. I am also offering the original oil painting of the Empress.   Receive a  tarot reading from me using my deck. You will be contributing to making this deck a reality. </p>

<p>The Tarot de St. Croix is a contemporary multi-cultural deck. The imagery is unique and yet relates to the archetypes typically found in the tarot.

<p>The Nine of Pentacles was the first card I painted. Traditionally you see a woman standing next to a grape vine loaded with fruit. On her hand is a falcon. The meaning of this card is harvesting the fruits of your labor. I painted myself gathering a bunch of sunflowers in front of an adobe house. I am now living this card – I have a home of my own that looks quite similar with a falcon that visits regularly! Printing this deck will be the harvesting of years of work painting it.</p>
<p>The Hermit is a curandero, a healer and wise woman from the American southwest or Mexico. She emerges from a cave where she has been on a vision quest discovering new knowledge. Her aspen staff with knots that resemble eyes; symbolizes the ability to see hidden truths. Recently I took a trip to Durango with Tarot experts: Carrie Paris, Marcus Katz and Tali Goodwin to be part of the Living Tarot Oracle and present workshops. On the way we stopped at echo cave in Abiquiui which is the landscape of artist Georgia O'Keeffe; who is an inspiration of mine. I realized it was almost the same scene I painted in my Hermit card, with the eye to the sky. When I found an aspen staff in a herb shop in Durango I knew that my year card the Hermit was alive. I have been in a cave of sorts painting my deck. I am emerging - help me bring this deck into the world.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>//BUZZCUT// began its life on December 15th 2011 in a tenement flat in Glasgow. With the loss of New Territories and Into The New (two very important performance festivals) the Scottish cultural landscape took a big blow! Unwilling to getting stuck in the mud, a team of energetic young artists decided to create //BUZZCUT// as a positive response to a bad situation and to create a brand new, exciting platform for outstanding performance work to be showcased in Glasgow... thus maintaining its reputation as a thriving cultural hub!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Since its birth on that December morning, due to its appeal to artists and audiences, the festival has grown from a three day festival in one venue, to a FIVE day festival in TWO venues! The programme is now finalised, supporting 45 artists from Strathclyde to Stockholm. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>//BUZZCUT// is a FREE festival, operating on a 'pay what you can' system' and all those artists who are travelling have met our spontaneity and inspiration. They will be paying their own travel to Glasgow while we put them up in each others' houses and feed them.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>To see the unbelievable programme, go to: <a href=""http://www.glasgowbuzzcut.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""//BUZZCUT//"">www.glasgowbuzzcut.wordpress.com</a></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>//BUZZCUT// takes place between March 14th-18th 2012, and with your kind donations we will be able to afford all of our essential expenditures listed below. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This festival's most exciting feature so far has been its spontaneous nature! It has existed for 6 weeks and has only 6 weeks until opening night. This has inspired the Glasgow community to pull together and make it happen as a lot of people really believe in its cause. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Beyond Glasgow, the performance communities in Britain and Europe have all expressed the need for such initiatives to be present in our lives despite wintery economic climates. This festival is inspiring people to look around to each other as opposed to above, and we're really excited by this!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Finally, //BUZZCUT// is providing a platform for 45 artists to show work, many whose work had no platform after the loss of the two aforementioned festivals. //BUZZCUT// also takes place in two new, vibrant, independent venues which are establishing themselves in the Glasgow community.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Essentials:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Venue 1 hire = Â£300</p>
<p>Venue 2 hire = Â£150</p>
<p>Soup kitchen for day long events = Â£150</p>
<p>Food for artists on day of performance = Â£200</p>
<p>Van hire (3 days) = Â£132</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Preferable:</p>
<p>Promo 300 badges + 200 posters = Â£155 </p>
<p>Printing 400 programmes (exactly how we'd like them) = Â£140 </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Total = Â£1,227</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We have included some preferable expenses as they would really make the festival feel professional and realise how we've imagined it!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Our target is exactly the same amount as our budget total as we will not need any more than this, so why ask? The festival operates on a 'pay way you can' system so we will be using these funds during the festival for unknown expenditures at this point. If we do not reach our target, of course the festival will still happen but we will have to be finding different ways to pay the venues and hire companies, and feeding the artists.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>All donations are so gratefully received and we will be thrilled with any financial support you can provide and we promise it will always go to essential use. Should you like to know exactly where your money went, we will happily and excitedly tell/prove to you.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We would like to include all contributors names in our programme. You would then be part of the first ever //BUZZCUT// contributors list and we would express our huge gratitude in paper form, but we'd also love it if you were able to attend the festival so we could personally thank you and show you all the work.</p>

Today I seek your financial support to help me create seven 48""x48"" works of art using recycled pens called ""Pentings"".<br/><br/>In 2005 I had a fantastic idea to collect pens and glue them on my 1981 Mercedes Benz 300SD, affectionately called the Mercedes Pens. So far I have managed to collect over 70,000 pens locally and from around the world, the first 10,000 ending up on the art car. Now that the Mercedes Pens is totally covered in pens I am launching phase two of my master plan to find homes for the other 60,000+ used pens I have pilled up and over flowing at my house.<br/><br/>I seek to raise support to produce seven recycle pen art pieces and take my passion for art, pens and recycling to the next level. Together we can help create something amazing, wonderful and full of joy. And as an added bonus prevent a whole bunch of pens from ending up in the landfill.</p>
<p><img alt=""penting recycle pen art made by the pen guy and the mercedes pens"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/249195/pictures/full/20120525004016-giving_tree_recycle_pen_art_the_pen_guy_01.jpg?1337931682"" src="""" style=""float: left;"" title=""penting recycle pen art made by the pen guy and the mercedes pens""/></p>
<p><strong>The Goal</strong><br/>I want to raise $8400 to fund the first seven 48""x48"" works of art made from donated used pens already in my possession. Your funding will go towards my time and materials such as paint, lumber, nails and lots and lots of glue. The good part is that I can get started on my first Penting for as little as $1200 and finish the rest as the fundings continues to pour in.<br/><br/><strong>The Big Picture</strong><br/>Every year about 1.6 million pens are disposed of and end up in the land fill and right now there are very few solutions to this growing problem. My dream is to create great art using old pens of every kind, ball point, markers, dryerase, felttip, crayolas and reduce the impact in this one area with your help.</p>
<ul>
<li>I started out by collecting and gluing about 10,000 used pens to my mercedes pens art car and although a great start I had to redo sections as the plastic broke down in the sun and rain. Not a permanent solution.</li>
<li>The second phase is to take the 60,000 pens I have collected so far and create art works that will be displayed indoors and thus prolonging the life of an empty pen a bit longer and create beauty in the environments in which they are displayed. (this is the part I need funding for)</li>
<li>The third phase is to get further funding to create large art instillations using millions of pens</li>
<li>The fourth phase is to put together a team of that will create and implement viable solutions in reducing the flow of empty pens into the landfills of the world that is profitable for all those involved.</li>
<li>The fifth phase is to see what happens when you cross disneyland and a billion pens.</li>
</ul><p><br/><strong>My Track Record</strong></p>
<p><strong>Collecting Pens</strong><br/>From the first day I started gluing pens to my car I had amazing favorable responce to my request for used pens with people, business and the media. All my friends brought me bags of pens and emptied out their draws. <br/><br/>Business would pile their extra pens on the counter and head out the door to take a look at the Mercedes Pens, emptying and entire bank once in the proicess. Schools have created pen recycling programs on my behalf and give me pens on a regular basis.<br/><br/><br/>I have several local thrift shops that collect pens for me on a weekly basis and continue to receive thousands of pens every month localy and from all over the US. I have also received pens from as far as Canada, England, Japan, China, Thailand Malaysia and Africa<br/><br/>I have recently partnered with TerraCycle who send me 30,000 pens and commissioned me to produce two Pentings for them in return.</p>

Together we can help create something amazing, wonderful and full of joy. And as an added bonus prevent a whole bunch of pens from ending up in the landfill.

The GoalI want to raise $8400 to fund the first seven 48""x48"" works of art made from donated used pens already in my possession. Your funding will go towards my time and materials such as paint, lumber, nails and lots and lots of glue. The good part is that I can get started on my first Penting for as little as $1200 and finish the rest as the fundings continues to pour in.The Big PictureEvery year about 1.6 million pens are disposed of and end up in the land fill and right now there are very few solutions to this growing problem. My dream is to create great art using old pens of every kind, ball point, markers, dryerase, felttip, crayolas and reduce the impact in this one area with your help.

I started out by collecting and gluing about 10,000 used pens to my mercedes pens art car and although a great start I had to redo sections as the plastic broke down in the sun and rain. Not a permanent solution.
The second phase is to take the 60,000 pens I have collected so far and create art works that will be displayed indoors and thus prolonging the life of an empty pen a bit longer and create beauty in the environments in which they are displayed. (this is the part I need funding for)
The third phase is to get further funding to create large art instillations using millions of pens
The fourth phase is to put together a team of that will create and implement viable solutions in reducing the flow of empty pens into the landfills of the world that is profitable for all those involved.
The fifth phase is to see what happens when you cross disneyland and a billion pens.
My Track Record
Collecting PensFrom the first day I started gluing pens to my car I had amazing favorable responce to my request for used pens with people, business and the media. All my friends brought me bags of pens and emptied out their draws. Business would pile their extra pens on the counter and head out the door to take a look at the Mercedes Pens, emptying and entire bank once in the proicess. Schools have created pen recycling programs on my behalf and give me pens on a regular basis.I have several local thrift shops that collect pens for me on a weekly basis and continue to receive thousands of pens every month localy and from all over the US. I have also received pens from as far as Canada, England, Japan, China, Thailand Malaysia and AfricaI have recently partnered with TerraCycle who send me 30,000 pens and commissioned me to produce two Pentings for them in return.

Media AttentionI have had countless of articles written, pictures taken and videos made and seen all over the world of the Mercedes Pens and my pen recycling program.

<h2><strong>Out of the Diamond Bank ~</strong></h2>
<p>Hello!  I am the artist Victoria Cessna, who rents a small space in an old building that once housed the ""Diamond Bank"" in downtown Pittsburgh, PA. This Campaign introduces the idea of you supporting my rent there and in return, you receive the work I do in the form of 'PERKS' according to the donation amount you make to help me. The list of thank you gifts is to the right side of this page.</p>
<p>The reason I am turning to ask you for help is that sometimes sales of my work can be slow. As with us all, my bills still come at a steady pace.   This studio is vital to the creating of my works as a full time artist. Your help will reduce the shear panic of debt when I can’t keep up with the rent.</p>
<h3><strong>Will You Support Me?</strong></h3>
</div>
<p>The amount I am seeking to raise is about two months studio rent plus the fees for listing on the indiegogo web service, and credit charges incurred for this campaign, shipping costs and supplies. Your donations will be an enormous boost and will allow me this time to keep building my portfolio while creating and delivering the wonderful ""perks"" for your donation. I will also have time to keep applying for grant opportunities (simply applying takes much time out of the work day). </p>
<div class=""im"">
<p>I will be working for you!  Since you will be funding me, I will show you what I am doing. You can see the progress and what I am able to create in the time you have helped me rent my studio.  This campaign will give me confidence by knowing I am doing the correct thing, following my dreams and knowing it is what I am meant to do, because you support me to do it!  </p>
</div>
<p>If I don't reach my goal, I will still send you what is promised to you according to the perk that your donation chose.  I have a lease on my studio, and will have to pay for it somehow. I will keep working and working and hoping. </p>
<h3><strong>Does your donation matter? </strong></h3>
<p>Yes! Every bit helps.  For five dollars or more, I thank you deeply for that. Your name will be mentioned in my thanks! I feel the support in the gesture more than you know.</p>
<p>If I can raise the full campaign amount, this funding will pay for my rent at my studio for three months. Any extra will carry me to further months, be used to buy supplies, and be put toward my transportation and costs around me working from my studio. </p>
<div class=""im"">
<p>It's always tricky to sell and stay afloat in bills with my sales in flux, so the impact for me is that I will be able to push forward steadily, studying and practicing my work without the shear panic of where my rent will come from, for at least this bit of time. I am so grateful for that freedom to push without fear, feeling your support.</p>
<h3><strong>How else can you help?  </strong></h3>
<p>If you cannot contribute monetarily at this time, please keep in mind that I am working as an artist full time.  I love communication about my work. Please follow it through all those networking ways I try my best to use for that reason. </p>
<p>Indiegogo has share tools! Maybe you know someone that might donate? Please pass this request along.</p>
<p>Sign up to follow me on Facebook, Instagram and /or Twitter. It's free and fun!</p>
<div> </div>
<h3><strong>Here is A bit about me~</strong></h3>
</div>
<p>I am a full time visual artist.  Art has been my passion all my life. If you know me, you know I grew up always creating something! I attended School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston before raising a family and continue taking classes as I can afford for continued learning in the/my Arts. Writing, photography and painting have been my favorite mediums. Married to a musician for 24 years, our children grown and pursuing their own careers in the arts, I am asking for help to continue.  When selling artwork as the sole income for any artist, the trouble comes with maintaining a balanced income. I could see benefits right away to having my own space. My productivity has really increased! </p>

The HeArt Attack will be a 6 foot tall paper mache pinata filled with candy that will be broken with a bedpost as the finale of a larger performance about broken relationships. This years 2013 HeArt Attack will take on a more Victorian paper cut feel with lots of decoupage roses. Since this years HeArt will not be accompanied by a game of bingo as it was in 2006, it will be filled with relics from my more recent relationship history &amp; be broken at the end of The News on 5 February 2013.</p>
<p>I am offering smaller HeArt Attack Piñatas for sale here on Indiegog along with some other relics related to my most recent heartbreaks to raise funds for materials &amp; travel expenses back to San Francisco for the February Event. By contributing to eX Marks The Spot, not only are you going to get a little piece of my heart, you will be contributing to an emerging body of my work that is rooted in capturing moments of our collective emotions in beautiful art objects. Thanks for all those broken hearts everyone! Lets make some Art &amp; break some more…</p>
<p>Most of the relics I have left from the 2006 Performance are being shipped off to be part of the permanent collection in the Museum of Broken Relationships that is on tour now and will open in Boulder, Colorodo on Valentines Day at the Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art in 2013.</p>
<p class=""first"">My 2006 Performance of eX Marks the Spot was part of group show of Interactive Art hosted by Red Ink Studios in San Francisco, CA. Features included painful &amp; hysterical accounts of all of my major heartbreaks to date through the recreation of a Mexican Style game of Bingo. The backdrop for my Performance of Broken Heart Bingo was a massive plastic shrine constructed with plastic, fake roses and piles of Mardi Gras beads. The shrine set the stage perfectly for the interactive game of Mexican bingo that I hosted with a revolving roster of the 300+ participants that attended the show.</p>
<p>The game featured handmade bingo cards &amp; an oversized game spinner that hosted drawings that represented my most devastating relationships. Door prizes were offered but frequently rejected as they included bouquets of abandoned tooth brushes, expired condoms, half eaten lunches, old journals, printed versions of horrible emails, mix CD’s of break up songs, parking violations and abandoned porno videos.</p>
<p>Posters for eX Marks the Spot were plastered around San Francisco and passed out as folded heart shaped notes as invitations. At the end of the entire event hosted by Red Ink Studios, the 5.5ft tall anatomically correct heart paper mache piñata was destroyed. Several guests at the event volunteered to break my HeART with a bedpost. Suspended from a beam 30ft overhead, the wireframe piñata was filled with Circus Peanuts &amp; covered with cut tissue paper, glitter and finished with 200+ fake roses as the veins.</p>
<p class=""first"">LaRece Egli grew up in a remote village Naknek, Alaska. Her experiences there have become the foundation of her life &amp; work as a Survivalist Artist &amp; Extreme Homemaker at her seasonal residence in Bellevue, Idaho. Her work emphases the emotional threads that connect all of us by recreating interactions with everyday objects. This focus has generated two successful businesses, LaRece Construction &amp; Vago HTS. She has also launched multiple Performance Art campaigns including Twice The Guilt &amp; eX Marks The Spot and is currently planning two new Performance pieces, Counter Culture which is based on the history of Home Economics &amp; The Strait Story which is a series of functional strait jackets constructed from significant pieces of fabric from her life.</p>

This project was extremely popular and finished at 218% funded!. We are now pre-selling the FULL set of 5 prints with the 6th bonus print FREE!**My name is Andrew Oatham. I’m a Visual Artist living in Melbourne, Australia. I was born in  England, where I started my art and design career, and I have always been fascinated with the often outlandish and disturbing medical and historic etchings, and the drawings from our past. I always wanted to own modern artistic representations of this genre for my walls. After consulting with a client in my gallery I put forward my artistic concepts and vision, and was instantly commissioned to create a limited edition print in this style - my artwork ’Stolen’ was born. From that vision I further developed the style to create other open edition versions.I’m using crowd funding to release my new artworks sets to an international audience which have previously only been available as framed artwork, and I need your support to reach my goal. *All art prints will be individually printed, hand-signed, sealed, and posted, personally by Andrew Oatham.I am looking forward to this being the first of many new artworks available as art prints, as well as framed artwork, in multiple sizes distributed globally. Art prints are professional High-End, Gallery Quality, Acid-Free Archival Paper Giclee prints, printed with UltraChrome® HDR all-pigment aqueous inks. as well as some more budget-conscious, quality smaller versions printed with high resolution Epson UltraChrome® K3 inks on Acid-Free Archival Paper.Immortalising the past and repurposing it for the future, each artwork contains historic images taken from vintage medical books which have fallen into the public domain, these are reborn in Photoshop and Illustrator and vectorised so the highest possible print resolution can be achieved. Parts of elements are redrawn, new elements are created and some elements are pulled from our vintage vector library, and then layered to give the perfect visual balance. Each artwork has literally hundreds of separate layers!Finally, each artwork is put through multiple print tests and 'tweaks' to check colours, and layout before the image is locked down and made print-ready for art lovers everywhere.Art prints are professional High-End, Gallery Quality, Acid-Free Archival Paper Giclee prints, printed with UltraChrome® HDR all-pigment aqueous inks. as well as some more budget-conscious, quality smaller versions printed with high resolution Epson UltraChrome® K3 inks on Acid-Free Archival Paper.**BONUS PRINT.

</li>
<li>I choose to stay here in Nova Scotia. There aren't a lot of jobs, so I 
want to create my own.   I want to spend time with my growing boys. I would love to be able share my work
 with the world! I don't have enough funds to get started. I 
would really appreciate any help that some of you maybe able to provide,
 and it would help to fulfill my dreams of being a stay at home mom and be able to help support my boys with my
 photography, writing and wirework.</li>
<li>I was born 4 months early at a weight of 1 pound and 7 ounces. I spent the first three months of my life in Halifax at the IWK Childrens Hospital. My eyes were damaged but I survived. Part of why I love photography so much is that it helps me to be able to see things much clearer and up close. </li>
</ul><p></p><p></p>I need 
business cards, brochures, prints, matts, sleeves and frames so I can 
participate in art shows, as well as attend markets and make my work 
more accessible to everyone. <ul>
<li>If you donate $50 I will send you a signed 12 x 18 print. If you donate $20 I will send you a signed 5 x 7 print.<br/>
</li>
<li>If i raise more than my goal I will put it towards photography equipment (I only have one lens). I would also put extra money raised towards learning more and improving my photography skills by attending photography workshops and classes.<br/>

sculptor living in Nova Scotia. The beauty of the rugged coastlines and 
the power of the ocean inspire me. 

I choose to stay here in Nova Scotia. There aren't a lot of jobs, so I 
want to create my own.   I want to spend time with my growing boys. I would love to be able share my work
 with the world! I don't have enough funds to get started. I 
would really appreciate any help that some of you maybe able to provide,
 and it would help to fulfill my dreams of being a stay at home mom and be able to help support my boys with my
 photography, writing and wirework.
I was born 4 months early at a weight of 1 pound and 7 ounces. I spent the first three months of my life in Halifax at the IWK Childrens Hospital. My eyes were damaged but I survived. Part of why I love photography so much is that it helps me to be able to see things much clearer and up close. 
I need 
business cards, brochures, prints, matts, sleeves and frames so I can 
participate in art shows, as well as attend markets and make my work 
more accessible to everyone. 
If you donate $50 I will send you a signed 12 x 18 print. If you donate $20 I will send you a signed 5 x 7 print.

If i raise more than my goal I will put it towards photography equipment (I only have one lens). I would also put extra money raised towards learning more and improving my photography skills by attending photography workshops and classes.

folk” band from Appleton, Wisconsin.

Additional Pasture Performances
are taking place in other venues on the DTour and Fermentation Fest also
features many wonderful classes and events. See the entire schedule and plan your visit here.The We Go From Where We Know Quartet. Watercolor by John ShimonLife Beyond Fermentation Fest
The
platform for the bandshell will include hardwood skids so that a trailer can
tow the entire structure. The 12 ft. width of the platform allows for safe
towing so the Harvestore Bandshell
can be moved and used by performers in surrounding towns and cities. After
Fermentation Fest, the bandshell will have a second life as a mobile stage and
functional artwork that can be deployed throughout these rural communities.
The
city of Reedsburg, Wisconsin has expressed interest in acquiring and
maintaining the Harvestore Bandshell
and making it available to other performing artists and arts organizations. Reedsburg
annually hosts Fermentation Fest and is fast becoming known as the home of
innovative rural cultural initiatives.

<p>My name is Caterina
Trabucco Avalos (Bir Jiwan Kaur Khalsa), Chilean, 36  years old and diagnosed with <b>Vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome​ (IV)</b>. I lack one of the basic
functions of the human body:collagen production at a cellular level, which in
turn prevents my organs, muscles and tissues from working normally. Due to this
syndrome, I have <b>Severe Dysautonomia</b>, <b>Pure Autonomic Failure
(PAF)​ </b>and <b>Marfanoid Habitus</b>, which means that my arteries
are extremely thin and highly likely to burst upon minimum stress or impact. I
have <b>Hypermobile ​Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome​ (III)</b>. This means that my
joints are hypermobile and easily injured, presenting difficulty to move and
extreme chronic pain. I also have <b>Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis,</b> which
means that my lungs are constantly swollen, activating the disease upon
breathing any foreign particles (dust, mold, etc.) (For more details please
check the Appendix). This diagnosis and the many challenges it poses, <b>creates
a low life expectancy and a constantly debilitating condition</b>. The traits
explained above make up a <b>uniquely diagnosed genetic mix in the entire world
</b>and my country does not possess the technology nor treatment for it. This
is why we have estabished communication and ties with European medical research
centres interested in my case.</p>
<p>In spite of this, my
strength and faith are renewed every day thanks to my <b>beautiful two year-old dautghter named Aima</b>, who may have possibly inherited the same genetic
conditions, as well as a multiple severe allergies. This is why we both <b>need to travel urgently to France, </b>to <b>Hôpital Européen
Georges-Pompidou</b> in Paris, because they can carry out the proper research
and tests for me and Aima. The <b>main purpose is to be able to study this
unique genetic mix and ensure a better quality of life for Aima,</b>allowing
her to develop physically, socially and emotionally. This research may also
help other people with my present conditions.</p>

<p>Every day my quality of
life and life expectancy are diminished, since I have very little joint
strength in my upper body, suffer from headaches, lack of concentration and
internal bleeding that causes tremendous pain, as well as problems walking and
speaking. I currently have to use crutches to move.</p>
<p>It is challenging to
have a normal life in my condition, to work, move and perform normal activities
such as going out on the street (my immune system is weak, making me an easy
target for viruses and bacteria).</p>
<p>I need to <b>get USD
$33.000, </b>to pay for the
cost of the medical research and treatment at Hôpital Européen
Georges-Pompidou, in Paris, France. I urgently need to travel and begin testing
to get proper treatment for me and my daughter. Doctors in Chile <b>have
declared me a lost cause, </b>saying that my only <b>two options </b>areto travel to
France for treatment or stay in bed waiting for my body to slowly
degenerate.</p>
<p>Asking for money is not
easy for me. However, since I cannot work to pay for this treatment, all I can
do is to ask for the help of kind-hearted people who are able to take us closer
to our goal.</p>
<p>Please, help me gather
the necessary funds for this trip. I am truly grateful to have the change to

Debido a este síndrome, tengo Disautonomía Severa, Fallo autonómico puro (FAP)​ y Hábitos Marfanoides, que quiere decir que mis arterias son extremadamente delgadas con alto riesgo de que revienten al más mínimo esfuerzo o impacto. Tengo Síndrome ​Ehlers-Danlos ​tipo Hipermóvil​ (III). Esto significa que como característica tengo hiperlaxitud articular lo que me lleva a lesionarme con facilidad y tener dificulta motora, con un dolor extremo y crónico. Y también tengo Neumonitis por hipersensibilidad​, que quiere decir que mis pulmones están inflamados constantemente, y ante cualquier inhalación de sustancia extraña (polvo, moho, etc) la enfermedad se activa (para mayores detalles, revisar sección “Anexo”).Este diagnóstico y los múltiples desafíos que ello implica, generan bajas expectativas de vida y una condición que me debilita a diario. Lo descrito anteriormente constituye una mezcla genética única diagnosticada en el mundo y en mi país no existe la tecnología ni el tratamiento para mi caso. Es por esto que se están estableciendo comunicación y vínculos concretos con centros de investigación médica en Europa para el estudio de mi caso.A pesar de esto, mi fuerza  y mi fe se renuevan cada día, ya que tengo una maravillosa hija de dos años llamada Aima, quien posiblemente ha heredado estas mismas condiciones genéticas, sumado a una condición alérgica severa múltiple. En este sentido, es que necesitamos viajar con urgencia a Francia, al Hôpital Européen Georges-Pompidou,en París, porque en este centro se pueden realizar los estudios y exámenes adecuados para mi condición y la de Aima. El principal propósito es poder estudiar esta mezcla genética única para que Aima pueda tener una mejor calidad de vida, que le proporcione un normal desarrollo físico, social y emocional. Como consecuencia de esta investigación, ayudar a otras personas que tengan alguna de estas condiciones.Mi estado hoy:Cada día mi calidad y expectativas de vida disminuyen ya que tengo alta debilidad articular de la parte superior del cuerpo, sufro de mareos, falta de concentración y derrames internos que me provocan mucho dolor. Problemas motrices que se manifiestan con dificultad para hablar y caminar. Actualmente uso muletas para trasladarme.En mi condición de salud es un desafío tener una vida normal, trabajar, trasladarme, y realizar actividades tan comunes como salir a la calle (mi sistema inmunológico está débil y estoy propensa a los virus y bacterias) Lo que necesito es reunir USD $33.000, para costear la investigación y tratamiento médico en el Hôpital Européen Georges-Pompidou, de París, Francia. Es urgente poder viajar para someterme a estos estudios y poder contar con un tratamiento adecuado para mi hija y para mí. Los médicos en Chile me han desahuciado, indicándome que tengo dos alternativas: viajar para tratarme en Francia, o permanecer internada y postrada en una cama, sin poder evitar la degeneración de mi organismo a partir de estas condiciones.Para mí es un desafío estar en esta posición, pidiendo ayuda monetaria. Sin embargo, como no puedo trabajar y costear este tratamiento, me atrevo a recurrir a todo aquel de noble corazón que pueda ayudarnos en esta misión.Por favor, ayúdame a reunir los fondos necesarios para realizar este viaje. Agradezco infinitamente de todo corazón la oportunidad de servir a otros a través de mi causa, pudiendo así ayudar a la ciencia médica a través de mi caso. Como mencione antes el estudio de mi condición permitirá ayudar a otras personas que sufren de este tipo de patologías genéticas.Bendigo tu ayuda y solidaridad, entregando mi causa a tus manos.Detalle de gastos de viaje médicoEste dinero se utilizará en los siguientes ítems:- USD $13.214 ($10.000 euros) Examen para identificar la mezcla genética exacta de las condiciones que tengo.- USD $925 ($700 euros) Examen para mi hija Aima, para identificar la mezcla genética de las condiciones que tiene mi hija Aima.- USD $2.860 ($2.168 euros) por mes, por concepto de manutención dado que no tengo familiares ni amigos en Francia, que me den alojamiento y comida. Este dinero es para mi hija y para mí.

unique genetic condition!
My name is Caterina
Trabucco Avalos (Bir Jiwan Kaur Khalsa), Chilean, 36  years old and diagnosed with Vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome​ (IV). I lack one of the basic
functions of the human body:collagen production at a cellular level, which in
turn prevents my organs, muscles and tissues from working normally. Due to this
syndrome, I have Severe Dysautonomia, Pure Autonomic Failure
(PAF)​ and Marfanoid Habitus, which means that my arteries
are extremely thin and highly likely to burst upon minimum stress or impact. I
have Hypermobile ​Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome​ (III). This means that my
joints are hypermobile and easily injured, presenting difficulty to move and
extreme chronic pain. I also have Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis, which
means that my lungs are constantly swollen, activating the disease upon
breathing any foreign particles (dust, mold, etc.) (For more details please
check the Appendix). This diagnosis and the many challenges it poses, creates
a low life expectancy and a constantly debilitating condition. The traits
explained above make up a uniquely diagnosed genetic mix in the entire world
and my country does not possess the technology nor treatment for it. This
is why we have estabished communication and ties with European medical research
centres interested in my case.
In spite of this, my
strength and faith are renewed every day thanks to my beautiful two year-old dautghter named Aima, who may have possibly inherited the same genetic
conditions, as well as a multiple severe allergies. This is why we both need to travel urgently to France, to Hôpital Européen
Georges-Pompidou in Paris, because they can carry out the proper research
and tests for me and Aima. The main purpose is to be able to study this
unique genetic mix and ensure a better quality of life for Aima,allowing
her to develop physically, socially and emotionally. This research may also
help other people with my present conditions.
My
situation today:
Every day my quality of
life and life expectancy are diminished, since I have very little joint
strength in my upper body, suffer from headaches, lack of concentration and
internal bleeding that causes tremendous pain, as well as problems walking and
speaking. I currently have to use crutches to move.
It is challenging to
have a normal life in my condition, to work, move and perform normal activities
such as going out on the street (my immune system is weak, making me an easy
target for viruses and bacteria).
I need to get USD
$33.000, to pay for the
cost of the medical research and treatment at Hôpital Européen
Georges-Pompidou, in Paris, France. I urgently need to travel and begin testing
to get proper treatment for me and my daughter. Doctors in Chile have
declared me a lost cause, saying that my only two options areto travel to
France for treatment or stay in bed waiting for my body to slowly
degenerate.
Asking for money is not
easy for me. However, since I cannot work to pay for this treatment, all I can
do is to ask for the help of kind-hearted people who are able to take us closer
to our goal.
Please, help me gather
the necessary funds for this trip. I am truly grateful to have the change to

will help other people like me who suffer from similar congenital pathologies.

I have worked now for many years on a 3D recreation of the Titanic, the most famous sunken ocean liner of all time.

<p>You might ask yourself; what differs my 3D work from the other 3D Models of the famous vessel? Well, it's simply the grade of detail. I am building the most detailed model of the ship to date, and I am modeling it to be as historically accurate as possible.</p>
<p>I'm planning to later release a picture book about my model with information such as how it was constructed, etc, and it will also be filled with beautiful renders and never-before-seen images. It will be a sort-of ""Ken Marschall""-esque book, but with my own images, renders, posters, and other interesting behind-the-scene peeks.<br/><br/><b>Prior to this summer I had hardware that was suitable for this project.

</div></div>","About My name is Dominik Tezyk, and I am a 3D artist from Bonn, Germany. I have worked now for many years on a 3D recreation of the Titanic, the most famous sunken ocean liner of all time. I have worked on my model now for a very long time and have put endless amounts of time and effort into this project. I have been interested in the Titanic ever since I was a child. 
You might ask yourself; what differs my 3D work from the other 3D Models of the famous vessel? Well, it's simply the grade of detail. I am building the most detailed model of the ship to date, and I am modeling it to be as historically accurate as possible.
I'm planning to later release a picture book about my model with information such as how it was constructed, etc, and it will also be filled with beautiful renders and never-before-seen images. It will be a sort-of ""Ken Marschall""-esque book, but with my own images, renders, posters, and other interesting behind-the-scene peeks.Prior to this summer I had hardware that was suitable for this project. Then, while I was on vacation, someone broke into my apartment and stole all my hardware. As a result, all my data, work, and working tools are gone. To continue with my project I will need a new workstation and working tools.
How does my work look so far? I have quite a few followers on my facebook 3D Project site (https://www.facebook.com/groups/293322404129215/), you can see much more of my work there.    
What I Need & What You Get  
I will need about 4200 Euros. This will go into software (Autodesk Maya), a computer (16-32 core i7, 64 GB RAM, Graphics card, mainboard, case), a PC 27"" screen, hard drives, and a cloud based database solution. With this equipment I will recreate the ship, like never before!!! If the 4200 Euro goal is not fulfilled, I will still find a way to raise the rest of the money. 
  

  Timeframe
This project will take a long time to complete; about 2 years, but the contributors are still guaranteed to get some very interesting goodies once the project is completed.

<p>Chicago Art Magazine
(<a href=""http://chicagoartmagazine.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">chicagoartmagazine.com</a>) was the most widely viewed visual art news source in
Chicago between 2009-2012. After it closed in 2012, all 1,000+ articles remained
online. Last month, the site went down due to a malware attack. Interestingly,
it was the critics, artists, influencers and gallerists who noticed the problem
– a testament to how valuable the articles in the archive are. </p>
<p>It cost several
hundred dollars to restore. It will need nearly a thousand dollars over the
next two years to update and protect the suite of websites from the new attacks that are
created every day. Chicago Art Map (<a href=""http://chicagoartmap.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">chicagoartmap.com</a>) is also at risk, but a
more complex site to support, so our stretch goal will include an audit of that software utility.  </p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Even years after
closing, the traffic to the magazine remains high due to the continued interest
in our content. We showcased thousands of artists, who often link to their
articles and reviews on their own portfolio sites, and those links will break
if the archive goes down again.  For many
artists and closed galleries, it is their only presence on the web. Over
2,000 sites currently link to Chicago Art Magazine, which is one of the many
factors as to why it performs so well in terms of search engine
optimization.  </p>
<p>The Chicago art scene between 2009-2012 was an odd time for art and the true wild west of publishing.  As I worked on the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Essential-New-Art-Examiner/dp/0875806627/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1415287774&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=essential+new+art+examiner"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">New Art Examiner book</a>, a decade after the closing of the magazine, I realize how these moments in time, no matter how imperfectly we documented them, have great value, and the value of the content increases over time as the past stretches farther into the distance.
</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>Technologically, from an internet/website perspective, the online magazine is now like a little old rickety boat in a sea that is infected by malware, spammers and hackers. The internet always moves forward, so even though the website remains unchanged, it becomes increasingly more vulnerable as new security flaws are exploited. Old Wordpress websites don’t age well and often vanish from the internet. For a few hundred dollars, we
can protect the site, but not rebuild it. With a stretch goal of $3,000, we
could give the entire site a face lift, manually re-format the articles, and re-launch
the new website design, while preserving all the current hyperlinks to articles.  </p>
<p><b>Team</b></p>
<p>Kathryn Born- I am the founder and creator of the site.
Chicago Art Magazine actually launched my career as a web designer and social
media strategist. When we launched, we had no money for graphic designers, web
designers, or system administrators, so I wore all those hats. Social media was
in its infancy, and I feel like (along with millions of others) we pioneered
the idea of “pushing” out our content through this newly popularized site
called “Facebook”. Social media was the cornerstone of our distribution. </p>
<p>Chicago Art Magazine was a massive paid team of
writers and editors. I could list over a hundred people, but there are two
people I must name.  Stephanie Burke,
with whom I began the site, launched site and pulled the original editorial team
and gallery review system together.  As the years went
by, Robin Dluzen went from intern, to writer, to editor, to managing editor, to
Editor-in-Chief. She transformed the magazine into an edited an elegant journal,
and she took over completely when I fell ill.  Both of these partners have continued their
art careers and are formidable forces in the contemporary art scene today.  I’m connected to dozens of our writers through
social media and IRL friendships and enjoy watching their careers flourish as well.  </p>
<p>We closed the magazine due to my health issues and the
fiscal impossibilities of running a local visual art magazine.  Occasionally I work on a series of short
pieces entitled, “The History of Chicago Art Magazine”, which tells the story
of the insanity of doing a local art magazine in a new wild west of online publishing. The stories of how we slugged through a newly fragmented media
landscape tells not only the story of Chicago Art Magazine, but a time capsule of Chicago art and the media landscape during those years.<br/><br/><b>FAQ </b><br/><b>I'm broke but want to help, what can I do? </b><br/>That's easy- post the campaign to social media.

<p>Patriots in Paint is a program designed to build a strong network of community involvement through art, activities and multi-media platforms. Through a large-scale mural series, Patriots in Paint seeks to honor the sacrifice and service of our nation’s bravest men and women and inspire millions in the community to come together and support our nation’s veterans.</p>
<p>Warrior Gateway, in partnership with mural artist Sam Welty, is creating a national movement that delivers local impact by rallying the community to recognize the work of local organizations serving the military. The murals will serve as call to action to collaborate and create a holistic solution to support our veterans and military families.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Our goal this year is to raise $10,000 to cover some of the costs associated with painting 11,000 sq. ft. of canvas. That includes the supplies (canvas, paint, brushes and so on) along with supporting the talented Sam Welty during this marathon mural painting extravaganza (including food, transportation and a nice bed to sleep in each night). </p>
<p>Not only will your donation go to support the creation of these magnificent murals but you'll get a little something in return. All will receive our endless gratitude and for a little extra cash you could be the proud owner of an original work of art from Mr. Welty himself. </p>
<p>We really, really, really (did I say really) want to reach our goal so we can get this mural done right. But, if for some reason we don't hit the $10,000 mark - the funds will still be put to use to off-set the cost of all the materials we need. </p>

</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The honest truth, 11,000 sq. ft. of canvas is no day at the park. But Sam Welty is certainly up for the challenge.

Weeks of ceaseless downpours since July 16 resulted in severe flash flooding in 11 out of 14 States in Myanmar.

The heavy monsoon rain </span><span>triggered flash floods, landslides and destroyed thousands of houses, schools, bridges and roads. There is no food, no water and little shelter. Whole villages have sunk in the flood and famil</span><span>ies, children and animals </span><span>who</span><span> have survived now </span><span>have nowhere to go. They are being surrounded by fast currents and deep water. Bridges are being destroyed, and the lack of communication and emergency transportation has isolated them from food, clean water and</span><span> shelter. Many areas are still completely cut off by high waters or damaged roads. </span></p><p><span>Due to the Burmese government’s characteristic</span><span> delayed response to the flood victims, private citizens and many local non-profit organizations are rushing </span><span>to access the flooded areas, </span><span>but </span><span>many</span><span> can only be reached by rescue boats and helicopters. Therefore, under life threatening conditions, many thirsty and starving people have been waiting hopefully to be rescued. </span></p><p><span>The </span><span>e</span><span>mergency management plan for natural disasters was </span><span>not properly </span><span>developed by the government</span><span> although Burma </span><span>previously </span><span>experienced Cyclone </span><span>Nargis in 2008</span><span>.

Weeks of ceaseless downpours since July 16 resulted in severe flash flooding in 11 out of 14 States in Myanmar. One hundred people have died and 1;000,000 have been impacted. However,the death toll and the number of flood-affected people has been rising. This is the worst flood in 100 years of Burmese history.The flood waters toppled buildings, spilled over dams, created landslides, destroyed bridges, rail lines and roads, swallowed villages and trapped people in high flood waters. The heavy monsoon rain triggered flash floods, landslides and destroyed thousands of houses, schools, bridges and roads. There is no food, no water and little shelter. Whole villages have sunk in the flood and families, children and animals who have survived now have nowhere to go. They are being surrounded by fast currents and deep water. Bridges are being destroyed, and the lack of communication and emergency transportation has isolated them from food, clean water and shelter. Many areas are still completely cut off by high waters or damaged roads. Due to the Burmese government’s characteristic delayed response to the flood victims, private citizens and many local non-profit organizations are rushing to access the flooded areas, but many can only be reached by rescue boats and helicopters. Therefore, under life threatening conditions, many thirsty and starving people have been waiting hopefully to be rescued. The emergency management plan for natural disasters was not properly developed by the government although Burma previously experienced Cyclone Nargis in 2008. There are no real time status updates about the flood in state-run TV and radio. Only recently the Burmese government has admitted to its weak response to Cyclone Koman and has requested international aid. Currently, flood victims are in dire need of safe drinking water, food, clothing, shelter and medical supplies. Starving farm animals and pets are also in need of food. Additionally, the flood victims are faced with the daunting task of rebuilding their lives and livelihoods. PLEASE JOIN THE BURMA FOUNDATION'S HELPING HANDS CAMPAIGN TO ASSIST THE FLOOD VICTIMS IN MYANMAR.  Please do share this campaign with your friends and family. Burma-Foundation is a non-profit group comprised of expatriate Burmese in the US  and their American friends who support the needs of the Burmese community in many ways. We are launching this “Helping Hands Campaign” with two objectives:To support the local aid groups and NGOs currently helping at those affected areas.To buy the Emergency & Disaster Relief Water Purification Equipment ($9300/machine) to help affected villages purify drinking water.With no overhead for administration, every dollar you donate will go directly into disaster relief efforts.

<h3>ABOUT THE ARTIST</h3>
<p>My name is Stuart Lantry and I am an emerging artist from Los Angeles currently based out of Philadelphia.  I have received a Masters in Fine Arts from RISD’s Painting Department and a BA from Dartmouth College. </p>
<h3>ABOUT THE WORK</h3>
<p>In this chaotic time where facts, truth and the basic tenets of reality seem constantly called into question, my work explores how we generate meaning from the surrounding barrage of stimulation. Using the artist's studio/scientist's lab as an ideal staging area for the production of meaning, I make mad machines. These complicated contraptions often create their own purpose and thereby solve a problem of their own devise. Turning ‘function’ on its head, my work wallows in its own absurdity. Individual pieces and installations often find themselves caught in continuous closed loops that perform my self-reflexive anxieties. Drawing on tensions both within myself and in relation to the surrounding built environment, my practice investigates aspects of routine while tenuously hovering on a hazy continuum between the past, present and future, fact and fiction. I try to use dark humor as a response to a world under duress, placing the viewer on a Mobius treadmill on which he or she must ask ‘where are we going?,’ 'is there value in effort?' or 'did I leave the water running?'</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h3>
<p>Starting two years ago as my grad school thesis project, this sculpture began as an attempt to design a water-based economy of scale for a potential near future. However, given the limitations of a thesis show, the piece felt rushed and never quite at home in the Convention Center.  The sculpture needed reworking, retouching and a  new setting.  It was then that I remembered California City.</p>
<p><strong>WHERE?</strong></p>
<p>In 1958, sociology professor Nat Mendelsohn purchased 80,000 acres of empty land in the Mojave Desert, with the aim of master-planning a model city designed to rival Los Angeles in size. However, Mendelsohn’s city never grew the way he had anticipated. In fact, it barely happened at all.  Today, all that remains of California’s 3rd largest geographic city is a vacant urban grid of crumbling paved roads extending indefinitely from a a tiny cluster of buildings, the only developed part of town.  </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">California City</p>
<p><strong>WHY?</strong></p>
<p>As my practice’s focus shifted towards looking at how people generate meaning, I knew that I needed to film this water-based machine in the desert.  What better location than this section of desert, which was given the plans and physical structure for a city, but no people ever came. Nothing ever gave these streets life, purpose or meaning… at least not until my sculpture came along!</p>
<p>Over time I have also moved away from documenting my sculptures with a dry video designed to illustrate how the piece works.  Instead, I have started making commercials for my sculptures.  While a commercial is able to achieve the same amount of documentation, the form represents an immediately recognizable genre that explicitly explores  how a video-based presentation can generate meaning.   Hopefully, these commercials will be able to add a layer (s) of meaning to the documentation my meaning-generating machines.  </p>

The Mechanical Pen and Pencil is precision machined out of solid C3604 brass for a full brass body construction. Specs are as follows: 

Mechanical Pen
49g 13.7cm / 5.4” (Parker G2 refill for the Pen)
Mechanical Pencil
49g 13.7cm / 5.4” (Schmidt DSM 2007 Pencil)

Each Interchangeable Mechanical Pen and Pencil will include:

Interchangeable Mechanical Pen and Pencil body
Push Cap for pen system
Eraser Cap for pencil system
Schmidt 9000 Easyflow M Pen Refill
Schmidt DSM 2007 Pencil Mechanism
3 Spare eraser heads
A choice for knurled or solid end caps



The Mechanical Pen and Pencil present with two cap options for your choosing. A solid and smooth cap for a streamlined look, or a knurled cap for a more classic aesthetic.
 


We work with brass to bring vintage discernment to our otherwise minimal industrial look.  The Mechanical Pen and Pencil come in three finishes - raw brass, black oxide treatment, and brushed nickel plating.
 


The Interchangeable Mechanical Pen and Pencil is a powerhouse between the Schmidt DSM2007 pencil system and the Schmidt 9000 EasyFlow M pen refill.
Being one of the most popular refills in the pen world, the Schmidt 9000 EasyFlow writes with a rich, fast drying oil based black ink with a touch of sheen. It's one of the smoothest refills on the market.
The DSM 2007 pencil mechanism is a compact pencil advancing system that's both reliable and enjoyable to write with. The mechanism screws into the barrel with screw threads for added stability.
 


The Mechanical Pen and Pencil will already come marked with an individual serial number on the inside of the clip. For the first time ever, custom laser engraving on the outside of the cap is offered. 
 


 

Single Pack
One writing tool, two functions. For minimalists and functionalists seeking one do-it-all sleek instrument that can hold ink or graphite.
Double Pack
One for yourself, one for a friend. Or two for yourself. 
Double Pack + Pouch
Our favorite option: have both pen and pencil at your disposal at all times. This combo comes presented in a minimal, sleek, full-grain leather dual case, so you'll never have to sacrifice style for convenience. (Each comes with both systems and accessories for pen and pencil.)
Corporate Set (10x)
A gifting set - great for businesses, events, and parties. Complimentary engraving on clip included - company name or individual initials/names. We will reach out after campaign ends for engraving details.

Wir rufen auf, gemeinsam in den Kampf zu gehen, um die unterschiedlichen Probleme, die alle Frauen betreffen, zu bekämpfen: Sei es die in Deutschland herrschende Spaltungspolitik, die in unseren Herkunftsländern unsichere politische Lage, soziale und kulturelle Angewohnheiten oder Druck aus der Gesellschaft und der Familie. </p><a href=""http://www.bda119.de/ausstellung-zum-10-jahrigen-bestehen-des-bundesverbands-der-migrantinnen-e-v/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.bda119.de/ausstellung-zum-10-jahrige...</a><br/><p></p><p>----- *** ----- *** -----</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447109312/blpbsormqtlpw7jkcyao.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>Katılımcı Bir Sergi Projesi</b></p><p>

<p>Almanya’nın farklı şehirlerinden, farklı
yaş gruplarından ve kuşaklardan, işçi, işsiz, ev kadını, öğrenci, akademisyen
kadınların birleşimiyle bir araya gelen Göçmen Kadınlar Birliği (GKB), <i>ırkçılığa ve ayrımcılığa karşı; eşitlik ve

daha sonra Köln, Berlin, Stuttgart, Hamburg ve Düsseldorf’un da aralarında

yaşadığımız sorunlardan hareket ederken diğer taraftan yerli ve göçmen kadınlar
olarak ortak talepler etrafında buluşmayı, karşılıklı önyargılarımızı birlikte
aşmayı hedefliyor. Uyum ve ortak yaşamı daha ileri noktalardan gerçekleştirmek
için işbirliği ve dayanışmanın önemine inanan GKB, Almanya’daki ayrımcı yasalar

// Ein Weibliches WörterbuchWir Frauen des Bundesverbands der Migrantinnen stammen aus den verschiedensten Regionen der Türkei, unsere Wege kreuzten sich hier in Deutschland. Am 28. November werden wir in Köln nicht nur unser 10jähriges Jubiläum feiern, sondern auch eine PopUp-Ausstellung vorbereiten, die unseren Weg bis heute darstellen wird. Mit der Ausstellung schreiben wir unser ABC des Bundesverbands der Migrantinnen!In diesem ABC werden die in den letzten 10 Jahren lancierten Kampagnen und Projekte vorkommen, unsere Feste und Veranstaltungen, unsere Pressemitteilungen und natürlich auch unsere Zeitschrift ""Frau"" mit ihren bunten Artikeln. Vor allem geht es in der Ausstellung aber um die vielen Beziehungen, die wir zu unterschiedlichsten Frauen aufbauen konnten. Mit diesem ABC der Migrantinnen möchten wir ein Werk erstellen, das unsere Arbeit, unsere Weltanschauung und unsere Kämpfe bündelt, ein weibliches Wörterbuch!Bilder sagen manchmal mehr als Worte: Was die letzten 10 Jahre für unsere Mitglieder aus ganz Deutschland bedeuten, welche Wörter sie zum Ausdruck bringen, welche Gefühle und Farben sie in ihnen hervorrufen, all das werden sie durch Fotos ausdrücken. Am Ende wird uns eine Ausstellung mit 29 Fotografien erwarten, die von 11 Städten und mehr als 300 Mitgliedern des Bundesverbandes erstellt wurde. Die Fotos und die Dokumentation der Ausstellung werden Teil der Bibliothek der Alten, einem künstlerischen Erinnerungsprojekt im Historischen Museum Frankfurt. Auf diese Weise werden unsere Erinnerungen Teil der Stadtgeschichte und der offiziellen Überlieferung.Hoch die Solidarität der Frauen! Gegen Rassismus und Diskriminierung; für Gleichberechtigung und Freiheit! *** 2005 kamen in Frankfurt Frauen aus verschiedenen Altersgruppen aus der ganzen Bundesrepublik zusammen. Unter ihnen Arbeiterinnen, Arbeitslose, Hausfrauen, Schülerinnen und Studentinnen und Akademikerinnen -  die alle eines verbindet: Ihre Stimme gegen Rassismus und Diskriminierung; für Gleichberechtigung und Freiheit. So wurde der Bundesverband der Migranntinen gegründet und erstreckte sich wenig später auch nach Köln, Berlin, Stuttgart, Hamburg, Düsseldorf und 25 weitere Städte. Zum einen ist da der Bundesverband der Migrantinnen, mit dem wir unsere Probleme als Migrantinnen zu Wort bringen können, auf der anderen Seite möchten wir mit Frauen aus Deutschland, die dieselben Forderungen haben wie wir, einen Dialog aufbauen und Vorurteile aus dem Weg räumen. Damit das gemeinschaftliche Leben noch besser funktionieren kann, glauben wir als Bundesverband an gemeinsame Arbeit und Solidarität. Wir rufen auf, gemeinsam in den Kampf zu gehen, um die unterschiedlichen Probleme, die alle Frauen betreffen, zu bekämpfen: Sei es die in Deutschland herrschende Spaltungspolitik, die in unseren Herkunftsländern unsichere politische Lage, soziale und kulturelle Angewohnheiten oder Druck aus der Gesellschaft und der Familie. http://www.bda119.de/ausstellung-zum-10-jahrige...----- *** ----- *** -----Katılımcı Bir Sergi Projesi
Göçmen Kadınlar Birliği’nin ABC’si  //
Dişil Bir Sözlük
Türkiye’nin farklı coğrafyalarından gelen
ve yolları Almanya’da kesişen biz Göçmen Kadınlar Birliği (GKB), 28 Kasım
Cumartesi günü Köln’de düzenlediğimiz şenlikte 10. yılımızı kutluyoruz ve hem

ABC’si.
Irkçılık va Ayrımcılığa Karşı; Eşitlik ve Özgürlük İçin
10 yıl boyunca yürüttüğümüz projelerden,
gerçekleştirdiğimiz etkinliklerden, hazırladığımız basın açıklamalarından, “Kadın”
dergimizde yayınladığımız yazılardan ve en önemlisi kadınlarla kurduğumuz
ilişkilerden, birlikte mücadelenin kadınlara hissettirdiklerinden, hareketle
hazırlayacağımız bu sergide, GKB’nin çalışmalarını, hayata bakışını ve mücadele
alanlarını bir araya getiren Dişil Bir
Sözlük oluşturmak istiyoruz. 
Almanya’nın farklı kentlerinde yaşayan GKB
üyeleri, geride bıraktıkları 10 yılı A’dan Z’ye düşünürken hangi kelimelerin,
nesnelerin, duyguların ve hatta renklerin onlar için ne anlama geldiğini
listeliyor ve kendi çekecekleri ya da hazır bulunan fotoğraflarla ifadelerini
görselleştiriyor. Sonunda 29 fotoğrafın yer alacağı bu sergiyi 11 kentte 300’den fazla GKB üyesi kadın birlikte hazırlıyor.

ABC of Migrant Women Association // A Female Vocabulary 
Migrant Women Association in Germany has been struggling
against racism and discrimination and fighting for equality and freedom for 10
years. Due our 10th Anniversary festival on the 28th November 2015 in Köln, we
are currently working on a participatory exhibition project, which will be
presenting our 10 years from A to Z: The ABC of Migrant Women Association. We
are developing “a female vocabulary” joined with images to visualize words,
feelings, notions and even colors, which talk about us, and our works. This
project, which criticizes the reflections of masculine world in our
socio-political, cultural and daily lives, aims to engage with more women and
inform them about our works. Therefore, we are planning to exhibit our exhibition
project in different cities and countries. With a similar objective, we are

“KADIN (Woman)” will be included into the book. The magazine has been regularly
published since 2007, and contains direct material for a retrospective review
of our 10 years history.  
To reach our goal and open the exhibition, in other words to
print the texts, the images and the exhibition book, we need your support! 
The Migrant Women Association (Germany) is based on
volunteering, and the exhibition project is in the same way.

<br/><h3>Chikara: The Art of Horimitsu</h3>
<p>力<br/><b>Chikara</b>: <i>A Japanese word meaning power, capability or influence. </i></p>
<p>Power can mean so many things in life. For tattooer and artist, Horimitsu, power is about inspiration and motivation in his work. <br/></p>
<p>Mitsu has been creating traditional Japanese tattoos for 20 years in Ikebukuro, Tokyo and he gathers inspiration from all around him. <br/></p>
<p>Tokyo is a place like no other and Horimitsu is truly one of a kind! You can see some of his work and life on <b><a href=""http://www.instagram.com/horimitsu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>Instagram</a></b>.<br/></p>
<p>Art is his passion and he works with clients spanning the globe to give them living pieces of art on their skin.</p>
<p>Although he has been a part of the renowned Horitoshi Family, his work is unmistakably his own. <br/><br/>He is constantly drawing, constantly improving, producing phenomenal pieces on both skin and paper.</p>

<h3></h3>
<p>I am a teen trying to break out into animation, as well as film in general, and suck at introductions. Lately I have created a large number of drawings, small doodles like the one above, and have developed an art style I enjoy developing. I use sharpies, drawing paper, and pastel to create these doodles then scan them, and sharpen the images in Photoshop. I feel if I expand to a digital art the quality of these drawings could improve tremendously. Reason for my choice in digital art is I have aspirations to create animations, as well as comic strips, of these characters I create in the hopes of building a portfolio to help in the upcoming college years, and hope to incorporate this hobby into a future career.  </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></p> </div> <div> <h3>Where Does Funding Go Towards?<br/><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span>

<p>If the goal is not met I would use the acquired funds to put towards the tablet, or try and acquire a tablet that's similar in functionality, but lower in price. Since I am not a professional artist I can offer a small random doodles with notes for contributions, and anything else feel free to contact me to work something out. As far as the doodles are concerned they are in the same style seen in the gallery, can be sent as scanned image or the original, whichever method you would prefer. I greatly appreciate any contributions made, and if none are made well it was great to take a chance.  If by some small chance I exceed funding by a relatively large amount, I will most likely put some money towards a college saving, donate some to charity, and would be open to any suggestions, assuming that even happens.</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I would improve tremendously in my work if this campaign is successful, as I can finally start to build a portfolio of animation  to branch out to new internships, and colleges in the upcoming months. As with any new medium I would take the time to hone my skills with the tablet, and hope to venture out into new art styles. My dream is to be an animator to incorporate my love for film in a fun way, not only to have fun, but challenge my skills in screenwriting, drawing, and video editing. It seems everyone breaking out into animation would want to become as successful as someone like Don Hertzfeldt, Ralph Bakshi, or Matt Groening, albeit that is something I would love to achieve I would be happy in just having this new hobby, and if I could make a living from my new hobby that would be amazing too. Like any other campaign you are taking a chance on someone you don't know, I understand the need to be hesitant in supporting someone new, and with that said I hope you can take a chance in helping me open new doors in life.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The only challenges would be meeting the funding goal, but as I previously said any contribution is greatly appreciated. If you are curious in knowing whether or not the funds actually went towards acquiring the tablet I would be more than happy to post proof of purchase on the campaign page, along with photos of purchasing the product, as well as the actual product itself when it arrives.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you can't fund this project that's fine I would greatly appreciate you spreading the word in any way you can. If this campaign does not succeed, whether I acquire not enough funding or none at all, It's great just to put these small sketches out there in the world, and if you spread the designs around to people to generate interest, that's awesome too. If you read through all of this I greatly appreciate the time taken, and thank you so much for any help you offer or simply reading this.</p>

It seems everyone breaking out into animation would want to become as successful as someone like Don Hertzfeldt, Ralph Bakshi, or Matt Groening, albeit that is something I would love to achieve I would be happy in just having this new hobby, and if I could make a living from my new hobby that would be amazing too. Like any other campaign you are taking a chance on someone you don't know, I understand the need to be hesitant in supporting someone new, and with that said I hope you can take a chance in helping me open new doors in life.
    Risks & Challenges The only challenges would be meeting the funding goal, but as I previously said any contribution is greatly appreciated. If you are curious in knowing whether or not the funds actually went towards acquiring the tablet I would be more than happy to post proof of purchase on the campaign page, along with photos of purchasing the product, as well as the actual product itself when it arrives.
    Other Ways You Can Help If you can't fund this project that's fine I would greatly appreciate you spreading the word in any way you can. If this campaign does not succeed, whether I acquire not enough funding or none at all, It's great just to put these small sketches out there in the world, and if you spread the designs around to people to generate interest, that's awesome too. If you read through all of this I greatly appreciate the time taken, and thank you so much for any help you offer or simply reading this.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p><p>Hi there! </p>
<p>Thank you in advance for taking the time to visit my
IndieGoGo crowd funding page. If you already know of my recent Drama School
success, thank you so much for visiting my page for more info - if you've
stumbled across this page by accident... please do bear with me! </p>
<p>I'm Alex, I'm a 22-year-old aspiring actor from Yorkshire,
and after a gruelling year of working, travelling and auditioning, and one very
tough decision, I am delighted and incredibly proud to say that I have accepted
a place at the highly prestigious <strong>Guildford School of Acting</strong> to start training this
September for an <strong>MA in Acting!</strong></p>
<p><a href=""http://gsauk.org/courses/postgraduate/ma-acting/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.gsauk.org/courses/postgraduate/ma-acting</a></p>
<p>I am a recent graduate of <strong>Lancaster University</strong>, graduating
in July 2014 with a <strong>First Class BA Hons in English Literature and History</strong>.
Acting is, and always has been, my love and my passion, and it was while
studying my degree, performing in every single spare moment, that I was hit
with the realisation that a career in acting wasn't just a wild ambition, but
an attainable goal I had the drive and ability to achieve. Now I have the
opportunity to turn a lifelong passion into my profession. </p>
<p>To be offered a place to study at any UK Drama Accredited
School is a great privilege and the very highest of praise, and this MA Acting
course at GSA will provide me with the training I both need and desire to prepare me
for a career in professional acting. The course offers an intensive year of cross-disciplinary training in acting, physical and vocal techniques, in both contemporary and classical texts. There are also classes in screen acting, contemporary, ballroom and Latin dance, stage combat, and professional preparation seminars.</p><p>I've worked tirelessly to get this far,
and I'm incredibly pumped to get started... however, there's <strong>just one final
obstacle remaining; the dreaded 'M' word... Money</strong>.</p>
<p>Anyone who has trained at Drama School themselves, or knows
somebody who has, will know it's anything but cheap. On top of this, there are
NO student loans or grants available for Masters courses at Drama Schools. This
means my tuition fees have to be completely self-funded... and at a whopping
<strong>£13,500</strong>, that's quite a challenge.</p>
<p>Having spent the last 12 months since graduating from
university working as a bar supervisor, gigging in bars and restaurants,
picking up acting work where I can, and being lucky enough to have a wonderfully
generous and supportive family, I've managed to save away most of the funds I
need for the course, but the very last financial leg is proving the most
difficult.</p>
<p>So with a couple of months to go before I start my course in
September, I'm still around <strong>£3,500</strong> short, and this is where this page, and your
kind selves, come in! I'm asking for your generosity to help me reach my
target, and while I know funding my actor training is by no means life changing
in the grand scheme of things, your hard-earned pennies would mean the world to
me, and really will be the difference between me being able to pursue my
ambition, and not.</p>
<p>But of course, I would never expect you to part with your
hard-earned pennies without being able to offer you a thank you in return. This
is why I love IndieGoGo! If you look to the right of this page, you'll see a
column of 'Perks'. If you are lovely enough to part with one of the amounts on
the right, I have put together some little perks, from thank you cards, to
bespoke songs, to theatre tickets, to say a HUGE thank you, and show you how
much your generosity is appreciated!</p>
<p>So there we go! </p>
<p><strong>Thank you very much</strong> for taking the time to read my story. If
you are able to part with any of your hard-earned pennies and pounds, or can take
the time to share this page with your friends through FaceTube and TweetBook, I
would be endlessly grateful. Your generosity really is very much appreciated,
and really will make a massive difference. <strong>Every little really does help!</strong></p>
<p>If you’d like to know more about my acting work to-date,

 The ARTery (#20145) at One Spark. We came in #4 in the art category and
 #12 overall with 998 votes, but more resources are needed to move The ARTery forward. Our community needs a
thriving downtown art hub. The Art League, Art Center Cooperative, and The Performers Academy are dedicated to transforming this historic building into a
central location for artists, performers, and musicians to collaborate,
showcase, learn, and perform for citizens of all ages. With your support we will make The ARTery a reality! All donations are fully tax deductible,",1.0,0,"2 Campaigns

It’s a creative process about setting aside our individual pursuits to discover and promote new ways of working and experience the collective power in art.</p><p>The initial 2017 exhibition that took place in El Barrio´s Artspace PS109, featured painting, photography, sculpture, video and sound. It was the outcome of a three-year endeavor and a long-standing friendship.</p><p>This multifaceted and experimental project has come out of our need to connect and expand through creativity and dialogue. Because of this, we want <strong><i>Uninhabited Rooms</i></strong> to be an international traveling show, including workshops and further exchange with other artists in the United States as well as in countries such as Italy, Mexico and The Netherlands.</p><p><strong>Involving the Nature, Discourse and Practice of Collaboration in Art</strong></p><p>Given the degree of human strife in our globalized world, we believe that art plays an ever more vital role in opening discourse among people. One of our main goals is to explore the artistic possibilities of collaboration as a means of personal and community awareness. Informed by cultural diversities, we seek to offer a creative antithesis and give relevance to this difficult time in the world, which is marked by issues that divide rather than connect us.</p><p><strong>Our Project’s History</strong></p><p>After meeting on a regular basis to wine, dine, and discuss our personal accomplishments and professional goals, we had an epiphany. One night, during one of our gatherings, Barbara read a poem she had written, inspired by a dream, that came as a message from a friend who had died.</p><p>The crux of the poem says:</p><p><i>look within</i></p><p> </p><p><i>move into your life</i></p><p><i>the uninhabited rooms</i></p><p><i>pain and sorrow are just trickster</i></p><p><i>who have move in while you were away</i></p><p><i>starve them and return home</i></p><p>The poem and its reference to uncharted space was a point of departure for discourse and experimentation. The stream of thoughts and interpretations that were discussed that evening, sparked our need to enter new visual territory. The premise was based on the idea of giving up something for a greater purpose, the idea of sacrifice that would confront us with unforeseen change and ultimately a form of transmutation.</p><p><strong>Our Intention</strong></p><p>By modifying each other’s work, we stepped out of our comfort zone to enter a realm of absolute uncertainty; moving from one form into another with abandon and trust. We pushed our boundaries in favor of a larger picture by exploring different formats and questioning the aesthetic of collective practices.</p><p>We relinquished individual authorship by altering and transforming each piece, resulting in a three-person collaboration. Working with, but not limited to painting, photography, video and sound, our intention is that our exploratory journey act as a channel to connect with others.</p><p><strong>The Artists</strong></p><p>Maura Falfán, Antonia Guerrero and Barbara Schaefer have solid backgrounds and years of experience working as professional artists.</p><p><strong>Antonia </strong>works with multiple media for her installation pieces combining drawings, lighting, video, performance and sound. She draws upon her Mexican and American backgrounds to explore themes of bicultural identities and ongoing cultural hybrids.</p><p><strong>Maura</strong> has developed a body of work centered in the idea of the vestige. Interested in the possibility of transformation and personal catharsis, she has welcomed an ominous quality in her work and promoted a sense of mystery through the use of a monochromatic palette.</p><p>After extensive years living in Rome, with its poetic sense of time, <strong>Barbara’s</strong> current interest lies in its fatal intersections where history is hidden.

<p>For the past 14 years I have been raising my daughter and I have worked as a bodyworker full time all of those years, so have not had tons of free time!!!. 3 years ago I kept having visions of myself painting so I picked up a brush and have been in love ever since.  It is one of things I love to do most in life!! I never knew until 3 years ago how much I loved making art.   I now finally have time to pursue my painting now that my child is older and is much more self-sufficient!!!! It is so exciting to have so much creative energy waiting to be expressed!!!</p>
<p>I have been teaching myself to paint and mostly experimenting!! I feel like this workshop would help me so much to gain some technical skills.  Autumn Skye Morrison is an amazing visionary artist and will be teaching specifically portrait painting this workshop.  Painting portraits is one of my favorite things to paint and in a visionary art style. This is the PERFECT workshop for my tastes in art!!!!</p>

</div></div>","I have launched this campaign to help me fund attending a painting workshop with Autumn Skye Morrison.  She is an amazing visionary art painter and is offering a workshop ""Soul Portraits"" in January. Here is the link below:
https://www.facebook.com/events/677977165623198/
For the past 14 years I have been raising my daughter and I have worked as a bodyworker full time all of those years, so have not had tons of free time!!!. 3 years ago I kept having visions of myself painting so I picked up a brush and have been in love ever since.  It is one of things I love to do most in life!! I never knew until 3 years ago how much I loved making art.   I now finally have time to pursue my painting now that my child is older and is much more self-sufficient!!!! It is so exciting to have so much creative energy waiting to be expressed!!!
I have been teaching myself to paint and mostly experimenting!! I feel like this workshop would help me so much to gain some technical skills.  Autumn Skye Morrison is an amazing visionary artist and will be teaching specifically portrait painting this workshop.  Painting portraits is one of my favorite things to paint and in a visionary art style. This is the PERFECT workshop for my tastes in art!!!!
The funding will help to pay for the workshop and my plane ticket there.  If I do not raise the total goal to  make it to the workshop, I will try to come up with the rest myself. If I do no get close to goal, I will use all of the money on art classes here in town.  There are no visionary art classes in the town that I live in so to be able to make it to this one would be a dream come true!!!

<p>Throughout my career as an artist, I have come to think of
myself as a janky roboticist, building machines that are the opposite calling
of one who would roboticize. The conventional idea is that machines are
productive and efficient in order to take the place of a human. Pairing
grandiose with pathetic, my focus is challenging this notion by making the
machines closer to what I see as humans: anxious, quirky, idiosyncratic, and
often unproductive. Based on the operation of my current creative practice, I use
my sense of humor to turn my thoughts of everyday happenings into a comedic
performance about these human characteristics.</p>
<p>Now I have a chance at developing this concept with two
great opportunities that will require traveling and building expenses.  First will be an artist residency
at Sculpture Space in Utica, NY. 
There, I will be provided with a place to live and a facility capable of
building anything my imagination can conjure. Building materials will not be
provided. To help with such things, the residency offers a two thousand dollar
stipend. Out of that stipend, the organization charges a nominal fee for
out-of-state recipients for the room they will be occupying during their stay. Sculpture
Space strongly suggested securing outside funding.  Once I make these creations I need to transport them to a
gallery in Houston, TX; this is the “phase two” of my funding campaign.  During March of 2014, my work is
scheduled to be exhibited at Box 13 Art Space, which is a nonprofit facility
with a focus on the advancement of experimental contemporary art. I plan to
transport the work in a box truck and drive down to Houston and install what
will be an exciting first solo exhibition outside of academia.  </p>
<p>I am asking for your support by donating toward the costly
shipping methods, truck rentals, fuel costs, and building supplies including
but not limited to wood, steel, hardware, and other devices that help give life
to my work. If you contribute, the capacity of what I create will only expand,
the work can be more humorous, and your contribution could allow not only the work
to go more places, but enable the artist to evolve to a new level. You would be
doing an absolutely positive act of kindness and what you will see at Box 13
Art Space will be a physical representation of your generosity. </p>
<p>My goal is five thousand dollars. The funds will lighten the
constraints on materials, allowing me to build without worry and allow me to be
creative as I possibly can be. Whether it buys a sheet of plywood or a sandwich,
any contribution will significantly help! Also, at the end of my time in
residence, I will have to arrange for the work to be transported and stored
until mid-February when I will be transporting the installation to Houston, TX
and again when the exhibition closes in April. The only numbers I want to deal
with while building are measurements, not wondering the about the cost of
materials and food. A fellow artist that I have supported said that “dreams are
expensive,” and with this road in front of me, I would have to agree. I am
calling on you to give what you can and most importantly, believe in me. Thank
you!</p>

Here is a link to their website: <a href=""http://www.cyec.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.cyec.net/</a></p>

The CYEC is a residential and educational program supporting over 150 street dwelling and vulnerable youth and children ages 3-22. Here is a link to their website: http://www.cyec.net/

Why
Thingamajig is important
 
I believe the current developments in the political and
social climate call for a counterbalance movement. The Thingamajig project
aims to engage the audience in facing the complex challenges of today's global
culture through multidisciplinary art.
 
By
combining technical means of interaction and conceptual means of cultural
exchange in my kinetic sculptures, I create a playground that stimulates
communication. The audience is triggered to reflect on subjects such as
nationalism, integration, migration, multiple identities; the idea of the self
in relation to the social environment.
 
So far, I have and need
 
At the

If you
cannot support me financially
 
I still
love you. 
 
You could
support the project on facebook and help me spread the word.
