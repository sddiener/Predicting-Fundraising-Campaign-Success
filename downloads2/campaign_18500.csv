<p>Hi, my
name is Morgan Carlisle. I am a movement artist who creates performance work in
Atlanta. My art can be described as Dance Theater as I like to incorporate multiple
media and styles. Terabyter will be the first solo show I have created and I am
truly excited to share my process with you!</p>
<p>If you
live in Atlanta, you have probably seen me around town at different art events.

based on <b>Vladimir Sorokin novel “Ice”</b>. In the city of Klaipėda I found a group
of wonderful people. They are young, dashing, creative and what is most
important - open minded people. We are working all together and feeling a real
joy of the process. For me in any creative work it's really important to enjoy
life and the creativity which comes from it. </p>
<p>In the early beginning of my works I was analyzing a
person as a slave of his own illusion. I thought that a person is what he
hasn’t done; he is his own dreams, he is what he believed in and wanted. True
face of the man for me was a compound of his unfulfilled dreams and fantasies.
Now I am interested in the question: why these dreams are not becoming reality?
Why a person can’t be what he wants to be? Why he can’t live always following
his heart? Why, instead of living <b>he only exists</b>? Why he is following norms of
society, religion, family and becoming hostage and slave of it? Why he dies too
early? These questions are essential in my creative works as well as in this

using the<b> language of hearts</b>. However, final goal of this race is to disappear
in the eternal light. Vladimir Sorokin wrote this novel not because of the
disappointment of intellectual life, but because of frustration of
civilization, modern people, whom forgot the real language of hearts. This
novel doesn't try to prove some recipe to fulfilling life therefore we don't
want to moralize nor to tell how people should live. In this utopian world of
""Ice"" a person becomes awakened when he is hit to the chest with an
<b>ice hammer</b>. If he is not a ""walking corpse"", this procedure is enough
to hear his real name and person is ready to start live a fulfilling and happy
life while understanding the language of hearts. Oh, how nice it would be, if
that would be enough to ""awake""? Unfortunately that's only an ironic
fiction, which asks: <b>are we really alive</b> or maybe our hearts are just
sleeping? We are trying to ask spectators this essential question;
we don't want to teach them. I think that everybody should find their own

least a little bit easier. </p><p><b>What We Need &amp; Why</b></p>
<p>Funding which we got from Lithuania
Ministry of Culture is not enough. We need <b>3000 dollars in order to accomplish

Also we have to finish sewing all of the costumes. Furthermore, we have to pay all

<p>Hi friends, John Reese here. I have a terrific opportunity to do what I love most: direct talented actors in hilarious and thoughtful theater. As part of the Double Take Fringe Festival on October 16 and 17, 2015, I am directing three intriguing one-act plays to present under the collective title, <i>Laughter in the Dark: The Sandbox </i>by Edward Albee is a black comedy that illuminates old age, marital relationships, the youth culture and the passing of loved ones. Shel Silverstein's <i>The Best Daddy </i> wittily depicts a father who gives his thirteen year old daughter a uniquely startling birthday present. <i>The Tarantino Variation </i>is playwright Seth Kramer's tribute to the disturbing spirit of Quentin Tarantino's artistry. </p>
<p>This is a wonderful opportunity for all involved and I just need a little bit of help to get it off the ground. Double Take covers the venue, promotion, box office and a few other things, but they can't cover royalties and production costs. Amazingly, these brilliant actors are all donating their time, as am I. Our cast includes local luminaries Bill Stewart, Jon Polgar, Stephanie Carlson, Michael Haley, Joan Haley, Rosie Caine, Marina Goldman, Theo Gabriel, Matt Haas, Deb McIntosh. So this really is a shoestring operation.

Our inaugural production brought Evil Dead: The Musical to the city for the first time, and we instantly gained attention. Our company celebrates: </p> <ul> <li>new talent</li>
<li>new work</li>
<li>resurrecting and discovering a fresh take on classics</li>
<li>challenging artists to take on roles they wouldn't normally explore  </li>
</ul>
<div>Our friends at Box Step Productions in London wrote and produced a HILARIOUS show called DEATH SHIP 666 in 2013, and it's an epic disaster-movie parody play! The show has since been produced in various European countries, experience grand success at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, received rave reviews, 5 out of 5 star ratings, been produced on the West End, and is now ready to take it's maiden voyage to North America! </div>
<div>What makes this production special is that it is one of our largest groups of new talent working on a show! This is our director's Milwaukee premiere as sole director,  the first professional production in the city for a few of our actors post-college, and some leads on the production time are experiencing their first time heading a department! </div>
<div>SO WHAT'S THE PLOT ABOUT?? The show can only be described as a parody play of TITANIC proportions! 
<p>Mix “Airplane,” (THAT'S RIGHT, WE SAID ""AIRPLANE!"" HELLO, ZUCKERS!!), “Poseidon Adventure,” a Nancy Drew
novel, “We’re Going on a Bear Hunt,” and a Blockbuster or Broadway hit in a big
bowl of water, with some explosions and pom-poms, then BOOM! You’ve got DEATH
SHIP 666! <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Serve over ice.</span></p>
<p>In short, 30 characters. 10 plots. 6 actors. 1 ship. </p>
<p>And we need your help before we set sail!</p>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We have a limited budget to work with, but your assistance will allow us to produce the highest quality production attainable! We've been able to already put together the skeleton of the show in ship terms: a charted course (script rights), a port of call (space and theatre rental), shipmates (a full company), and  a map (official performance dates on the calendar). So the show going on is official and will happen. </p>
<p>But your funds will help soften the costs of the tangible items that build the ship. These items will help make this production a true spectacle. These are items such as: </p> <ul>
<li>Shovel and Coal for the Engine (props) </li>
<li>Ship (set construction and material)  <br/>
</li>
<li>Uniforms (costumes)<br/>
</li>
<li>""Board the Ship!"" Flyers (advertisement)</li>
<li>Investor Publications (programs) </li> <li>and MORE! </li> </ul>
<div>And we want to thank you for your help! We'd love to give you thank you notes and videos, public recognition, a photo album full of stills from rehearsal and the show, and even a DVD of the show! (hey out of towners! Here's a chance for you to see the ship's voyage!) </div>
<div>We're also going to be doing 3 FREE talk-backs with the cast and director after 3 of the performances. Our company wants to be close and connected with our city and audience members, and we'd love to answer any questions you may have! </div>
<div>WE APOLOGIZE BUT THE RAFFLE HAS BEEN CANCELLED DUE TO INDIE GOGO TERMS OF AGREEMENT</div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>This show is something special. With this show, we are: </p> <ul> <li>We're introducing new talent! A great handful of our company is tackling
 new roles they've always wanted to explore, and for others this is a 
Milwaukee Premiere presenting their craft.<br/>
</li>
<li> Producing entertainment at a time when theatres are normally dark, or 
getting ready for winter shows. We're going to ensure that high-quality 
productions are available in the city year-round!</li>
<li>Bringing a North American Premiere of a wildly successful West End production to our amazing city, a place that doesn't get to see too many North American Premieres</li>
<li>Building connections with an overseas theatre and film production company that we hope to share with local artists that will join our company for future productions</li>
<li>Keeping activity alive at The Alchemist Theatre while the managers work on their next project </li> </ul>
<div>Support local theatre and new work. You can be apart of the start of something great! </div> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>There are so many risks with this show: </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">This show is brand new to North America, and it's being produced by a new company. Publicly bringing forth new work is a complete gamble. First impressions are everything, and we just want to share this amazingly entertaining story with you!</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Let's not forget the show is going up in November. Not only will we be battling the weather and football season, but also a time where theatres are normally dark and </span>productions<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> are not in performances yet. Our goal is to keep theatre running year-round, and we're doing that by putting on a production at a time where other companies usually take a break. </span>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Did we mention the weather? Let us offer you a warm and </span>entertaining<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> place to go and something different to do during this time! Also, Thanksgiving will be just around the corner -- bring the family!! Entertain your out of town relatives with </span>something<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> they CANNOT SEE ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD! WE ARE CURRENTLY THE ONLY COMPANY PRODUCING THIS SHOW!</span>
</li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We've noticed original work isn't something people are usually willing to take risks on. We're here to prove why you should -- besides, this show has already been proven successful overseas! It's time to make it success on our land now! </span></li>
<li>Let's mention this again: 30 characters. 10 plots. 6 actors. 1 ship. Why would you want to miss THAT? </li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">If things go well in </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Milwaukee,</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">  we plan on taking it to Chicago, going on the road, maybe even NYC! And the original writers have rumored they're dabbling with the idea of turning it into a film...</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But we need to get started here first. And that's where you come in. </p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">Other Ways You Can Help</span></p>

Our inaugural production brought Evil Dead: The Musical to the city for the first time, and we instantly gained attention. Our company celebrates:   new talent
new work
resurrecting and discovering a fresh take on classics
challenging artists to take on roles they wouldn't normally explore  

Our friends at Box Step Productions in London wrote and produced a HILARIOUS show called DEATH SHIP 666 in 2013, and it's an epic disaster-movie parody play! The show has since been produced in various European countries, experience grand success at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, received rave reviews, 5 out of 5 star ratings, been produced on the West End, and is now ready to take it's maiden voyage to North America! 
What makes this production special is that it is one of our largest groups of new talent working on a show! This is our director's Milwaukee premiere as sole director,  the first professional production in the city for a few of our actors post-college, and some leads on the production time are experiencing their first time heading a department! 
SO WHAT'S THE PLOT ABOUT?? The show can only be described as a parody play of TITANIC proportions! 
Mix “Airplane,” (THAT'S RIGHT, WE SAID ""AIRPLANE!"" HELLO, ZUCKERS!!), “Poseidon Adventure,” a Nancy Drew
novel, “We’re Going on a Bear Hunt,” and a Blockbuster or Broadway hit in a big
bowl of water, with some explosions and pom-poms, then BOOM! You’ve got DEATH
SHIP 666! Serve over ice.
In short, 30 characters. 10 plots. 6 actors. 1 ship. 
And we need your help before we set sail!
   What We Need & What You Get We have a limited budget to work with, but your assistance will allow us to produce the highest quality production attainable! We've been able to already put together the skeleton of the show in ship terms: a charted course (script rights), a port of call (space and theatre rental), shipmates (a full company), and  a map (official performance dates on the calendar). So the show going on is official and will happen. 
But your funds will help soften the costs of the tangible items that build the ship. These items will help make this production a true spectacle. These are items such as:  
Shovel and Coal for the Engine (props) 
Ship (set construction and material)  

Uniforms (costumes)

""Board the Ship!"" Flyers (advertisement)
Investor Publications (programs)  and MORE!  
And we want to thank you for your help! We'd love to give you thank you notes and videos, public recognition, a photo album full of stills from rehearsal and the show, and even a DVD of the show! (hey out of towners! Here's a chance for you to see the ship's voyage!) 
We're also going to be doing 3 FREE talk-backs with the cast and director after 3 of the performances. Our company wants to be close and connected with our city and audience members, and we'd love to answer any questions you may have! 
WE APOLOGIZE BUT THE RAFFLE HAS BEEN CANCELLED DUE TO INDIE GOGO TERMS OF AGREEMENT   The Impact This show is something special. With this show, we are:   We're introducing new talent! A great handful of our company is tackling
 new roles they've always wanted to explore, and for others this is a 
Milwaukee Premiere presenting their craft.

 Producing entertainment at a time when theatres are normally dark, or 
getting ready for winter shows. We're going to ensure that high-quality 
productions are available in the city year-round!
Bringing a North American Premiere of a wildly successful West End production to our amazing city, a place that doesn't get to see too many North American Premieres
Building connections with an overseas theatre and film production company that we hope to share with local artists that will join our company for future productions
Keeping activity alive at The Alchemist Theatre while the managers work on their next project  
Support local theatre and new work. You can be apart of the start of something great!    Risks & Challenges There are so many risks with this show: 


This show is brand new to North America, and it's being produced by a new company. Publicly bringing forth new work is a complete gamble. First impressions are everything, and we just want to share this amazingly entertaining story with you!

Let's not forget the show is going up in November. Not only will we be battling the weather and football season, but also a time where theatres are normally dark and productions are not in performances yet. Our goal is to keep theatre running year-round, and we're doing that by putting on a production at a time where other companies usually take a break. 


Did we mention the weather? Let us offer you a warm and entertaining place to go and something different to do during this time! Also, Thanksgiving will be just around the corner -- bring the family!! Entertain your out of town relatives with something they CANNOT SEE ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD! WE ARE CURRENTLY THE ONLY COMPANY PRODUCING THIS SHOW!

We've noticed original work isn't something people are usually willing to take risks on. We're here to prove why you should -- besides, this show has already been proven successful overseas! It's time to make it success on our land now! 
Let's mention this again: 30 characters. 10 plots. 6 actors. 1 ship. Why would you want to miss THAT? 

If things go well in Milwaukee,  we plan on taking it to Chicago, going on the road, maybe even NYC! And the original writers have rumored they're dabbling with the idea of turning it into a film...


But we need to get started here first. And that's where you come in. 
Other Ways You Can Help
 If you're unable to donate, there's lots of other ways to help!   Share this page and check out/share our social media pages. Spread the word!!

<h2><strong>Education</strong></h2>
<p>Twelve months ago, we launched a new education program. Our goal is for students of all ages to discover fresh, modern, and personal connections to Shakespeare that will spark a lasting interest in theater, and in classic works. </p>
<p>In our first year, we reached over 500 students through workshops in Massachusetts schools and Boys &amp; Girls Clubs. We also launched our well-regarded Teen Touring Troupe. TTT is a company of motivated young actors and actresses who get the opportunity to tour a Shakespeare production to local schools and community centers. </p>
<p>Due to its success and continued demand, our education program is growing and expanding fast! This year, our goal is to triple the number of students we work with. We are on track to double our workshops, grow our Teen Touring Troupe (in addition to offering two full scholarships) and to launch a professional touring production that will perform in schools all around Massachusetts. <br/>We will also offer free theater workshops to Boston public schools in association with our upcoming production of <i>Finish Line</i>.</p>

<h2><strong>Why We Need Your Help</strong></h2>
<p>Our goal is to offset the entire production cost of <i>Finish Line</i> through our Indiegogo.com campaign and corporate and business sponsorships. This will ensure that all tickets proceeds will be donated to charity.</p>
<p>Funds raised will directly go to cover costs, including production space in Boston, costumes, props, lights, actor stipends, designer stipends, and printing scripts and programs.</p>
<p>Funds will also help ensure our education program can run in tandem with <i>Finish Line</i>. In addition to offering two full scholarships for our TTT program, we will teach free theater workshops titled “Telling Our Stories, Facing Our Fears."" Through movement, storytelling, and tableaux work, students in these workshops will reflect on their own experiences of the Boston Marathon bombing, pairing their own words with Shakespeare sonnets to create an original performance piece. Students in these workshops will also receive free <i>Finish Line</i> tickets and present their original work to the cast. </p>

<p>What happens when you write a play, lightening strikes, and it comes together so tightly that in a competitive field of more than 70 plays it wins Best Play, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Actress?</p>
<p>Well, in the case of <strong>""It's All About Lorrie""</strong> by Joseph Krawczyk, you bring it back to the stage (ATA January 25-February 5, 2016) and then all the way to Off-Broadway and beyond! </p>
<p><strong>But first things, first... We NEED YOUR HELP... $1, $5, $10...any donation helps! JUST CLICK the pink ""BACK IT"" Button! </strong></p>
<p>This comedy deserves to be seen! It NEEDS more than just 3 festival performances to gain the attention of long-term partners. The audience agrees. The critics agree. The festival agrees. This comedy by Joe Krawczyk is a winner. </p>
<p>And you can be a winner by helping us with any contribution you can afford!</p>
<p>Award-winning playwright Joseph P. Krawczyk is determined to bring this wonderful and talented team to the stage again at the American Theatre of Actors on January 25th - February 5th, 2017 to finally give his show the audience it deserves and he is excited to do so with the help of his friends at ATA and the support and contributions of Arts-Friendly benefactors such as yourself! </p>
<p>In part, the run will give the show the momentum it needs to make its journey to the professional stage (Off-Broadway), while allowing the team to fine-tune this wonderful, funny and inspiring material about a woman who knows how to take charge and won't take no for an answer!</p>
<p>It's a modern day tale of feminism, with a magical and very funny touch.</p>
<h3>Why We Need Your Financial Support. </h3>
</div><div>
<p>Taking this show ""OFF-BROADWAY"" is an expensive proposition if you want to do it right. Just walking in the door, you need investments in the amount of 175k-250k. <strong>We are not there yet, of course. </strong>But if we want to get there, we first must run a successful limited engagement ""OFF-OFF-BROADWAY"" to attract supporters and partners, gather more reviews, and demonstrate that the play has the potential to be successful on the professional stage. We are 110% certain that we have a magical work of theatre here and we want to invite you along on the journey.</p>
<p>To be able to produce the play we will need to budget for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Salaries</li>
<li>Fees for technicians</li>
<li>Marketing costs</li>
<li>Set design and building</li>
<li>Materials for sets and props and costumes</li>
<li>Transportation</li>
<li>Costumes</li>
<li>Sound and Lighting Design... and much more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every dollar you can donate to help bring these incredibly talented, young performers and our creative team to the stage at ATA will help us not only get to this limited engagement run, but also give us the boost we need to proceed to Off Broadway and perhaps beyond.</p>
<p>Our goal is to raise a little over 14K for this run (average by most OOB standards) and then be in the position to invite larger investments to take us beyond. BUT FIRST, we need your help with the OOB production. Join us on this critical first step of the journey and you will be part of something unique, an off-Broadway hit. We are that certain about this play. </p>
<h3>What's In It For YOU?</h3>
<p>Your support for the arts is what sets you apart and above the rest. By helping us achieve this modest goal to run the show at ATA, you also make it possible for us to continue the journey and take many of you along with us....  We're certain that we have a winning script, winning actors, and a winning creative team! So much so, that we have put aside our other projects, gathered our resources, and started on our way. Script revisions are being done. Rehearsals are beginning right after the holidays. We are doing this. Will you help us?</p>
<p>All contributions will be appreciated! But for larger contributions, not only will you get all the goodies described in the ""PERKS"" section of this Indiegogo Campaign, but you will also get FREE tickets to our OB Previews when we arrive OFF BROADWAY. We are so sure this will happen that we are making the promise now!</p>
<p>We offer quite a few opportunities to be with us as we attempt what only a few have had the chance to attempt! In fact, if you are so inclined, we have opportunities to really become part of our team.</p>
<p>Please go to our Perks Page to see all the levels we offer.  But remember, any help from $1 to $10,000 is greatly appreciated! <strong>Hit the pink ""Back It"" button to make whatever donation you can afford!</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>As we have mentioned, some people just can't contribute, we get that... but thanks to the ease and power of social media, perhaps you can help share our story and encourage your friends to support us. Yes, every dollar helps... even $5, $10, $20... So help us spread the word! SHARE&gt;SHARE&gt;SHARE!</p>
<p><strong>Give any donation of any amount and enter to win 2 Free tickets to the OB opening night production of ""It's All About Lorrie!""</strong></p>

Sound and Lighting Design... and much more.

Every dollar you can donate to help bring these incredibly talented, young performers and our creative team to the stage at ATA will help us not only get to this limited engagement run, but also give us the boost we need to proceed to Off Broadway and perhaps beyond.
Our goal is to raise a little over 14K for this run (average by most OOB standards) and then be in the position to invite larger investments to take us beyond. BUT FIRST, we need your help with the OOB production. Join us on this critical first step of the journey and you will be part of something unique, an off-Broadway hit. We are that certain about this play. 
What's In It For YOU?
Your support for the arts is what sets you apart and above the rest. By helping us achieve this modest goal to run the show at ATA, you also make it possible for us to continue the journey and take many of you along with us....  We're certain that we have a winning script, winning actors, and a winning creative team! So much so, that we have put aside our other projects, gathered our resources, and started on our way. Script revisions are being done. Rehearsals are beginning right after the holidays. We are doing this. Will you help us?
All contributions will be appreciated! But for larger contributions, not only will you get all the goodies described in the ""PERKS"" section of this Indiegogo Campaign, but you will also get FREE tickets to our OB Previews when we arrive OFF BROADWAY. We are so sure this will happen that we are making the promise now!
We offer quite a few opportunities to be with us as we attempt what only a few have had the chance to attempt! In fact, if you are so inclined, we have opportunities to really become part of our team.
Please go to our Perks Page to see all the levels we offer.  But remember, any help from $1 to $10,000 is greatly appreciated! Hit the pink ""Back It"" button to make whatever donation you can afford!

Other Ways You Can Help
As we have mentioned, some people just can't contribute, we get that... but thanks to the ease and power of social media, perhaps you can help share our story and encourage your friends to support us. Yes, every dollar helps... even $5, $10, $20... So help us spread the word! SHARE>SHARE>SHARE!
Give any donation of any amount and enter to win 2 Free tickets to the OB opening night production of ""It's All About Lorrie!""
And that's all there is to it. Lorrie is a magical character. You can be a magical supporter!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

I will be traveling with Kelsey Vidic, a professional costume designer and artistic collaborator. Kelsey and I share a common curiosity and desire to be immersed in this foreign culture. We will be beginning in Mumbai, and will travel along the south to Bangalore, Goa, and Kerala. This will be my first experience traveling abroad; a chance to broaden my artistic horizons and assuredly change my life. <b>In our travels to India, we will collaborate, share stories, and cultivate artistic habits.

What are my tools for creating dance as an activist and therapist?  How is art a healing practice? How do I integrate the spiritual and physical practices of Kundalini yoga and dance?


   How do I continue building my artistic career?
I need your help! I am passionate and committed to this opportunity of concentrated research in India this summer. I would love your support and investment to the future of my career and ultimately the future of the dance world.
Any way you can help, whether its financially, through sharing experiences of travel, or connections in India, will be incredibly beneficial. I need help with housing, food, and travel costs.
Your generosity will directly support the growth of my career. You will receive the gift of movement with any donation. I look forwards to this opportunity to share my art with you!",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<ul>
<li>My name is Richard Mazda. I founded the theatre to create opportunities for creatives and to provide a cultural harbor for Long Island City. I began my adult life as a teenage actor and then switched to making music as a songwriter/producer before switching back over 20 years ago.</li>
<li>We have big dreams at The Secret Theatre and this campaign is just one way in which we make those dreams come true. In 2017 we will raise the bar again with a fresh take on the iconic show Cabaret which is followed by King Lear which will feature a Tony nominee in the role of Cordelia and award winning and beloved character actor/director Austin Pendleton as Lear.  This campaign will enable us to continue to mount shows and productions that are closer to Broadway's level of skills and production value and will also help us continue to provide incredible programming for years to come.</li>
<li>By supporting us you are going to help us bring actors, directors and other artists to an area of Queens that needs a diverse and exciting cultural life that will support and keep pace with Long Island City's exponential growth.   You are helping to ensure that great theatre is available to all in the most diverse borough in the country.</li>

<p>""Zuccotti Park"" examines the  human side of economics:  the CEO of a large corporation, a homeless veteran, a laid off factory worker,  a family buying their first home, a student who can't find a job.  The play takes place as Cooper, a soldier on leave from Afghanistan, visits childhood friend, Kate, in NYC and finds that she is now totally devoted to the Occupy Movement. Cooper is attracted to grown up Kate, despite the fact that they disagree on almost everything. <br/></p>
<p>""Zuccotti Park"" has been accepted into the Venus Adonis NYC Theater 
Festival. It will open on February 26th at the Robert Moss Theater.  The play was written by Catherine Hurd, Music by Vatrena King, will be produced by Salgado Productions, and directed by Luis 
Salgado. The Music Director is Joshua Coyne.  <br/></p>
<p>We need funds to help produce this very unique and important musical in NY City.  Our team is incredible, we've worked very hard on the project, and we we believe that what we have to say in ""Zuccotti Park"" will touch people emotionally and also add to their understanding of the way things work both politically and economically. <a href=""http://www.zuccottiparkmusical.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.zuccottiparkmusical.com</a><br/></p>

   JOSHUA COYNE, MUSIC DIRECTOR:   Joshua is a young Black musician and composer who took his first lessons at the Cedar Rapids Symphony School, where he 
studied with Dr. Stephen Shepherd and later with concertmaster Taki 
Horiuchi. Later, Joshua moved to the Washington, 
DC area, where he continued his violin studies with Lya Stern and began 
composition study.
After moving to D.C., Joshua performed for then candidate Barack Obama 
at the Stand for Change Rally, as well as for the Haitian Embassy.
Coyne composed the score to Anne and Emmett, a play about Emmett Till 
and Anne Frank written by Janet Langhart Cohen. <br/></p>

</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Producing a musical play in NYC is a huge deal. It can be expensive, but because we have a creative and passionate producer, who comes up with great ideas that are also less expensive, we have manageable budget.  So we are trying to raise $10,000 for the production. That money will pay for the director, musical director, props, costumes, musicians, stipend for the actors,  etc.  Of course, if we raise more money that would be awesome. It will be put to work improving the show. But we can DO the show for $10,000.  For anyone interested, we will provide you with a detailed cost breakdown. <br/></p>
<p>For incentives, people donating $200.00 or more will be given two tickets to the show, $100.00 or more... a DVD of the show.  $50.00 or more... a Zuccotti Park mouse pad, $10.00 or more... a thank you email from the writer, composer, director and musical director. <br/>
</p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>""Zuccotti Park"" is a play that seeks to pull people together rather than drive them apart.  It is the opposite of mainstream media in that regard. It highlights our commonalities rather than differences. One reason that our director, Luis Salgado, took on the project was because of its objectivity in presenting many sides of the economic picture. <br/></p>
<p>We had a very successful reading at the Woodland Opera House.  We distributed a comment sheet to the audience, and without exception, the answer to the question: ""Would you recommend this musical to a friend?"" was ""YES!""<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have already had successful auditions in NYC.  Some amazing talent showed up despite the 10 degree weather. The only difficult part was selecting the best out of a stellar group.  <br/></p>
<p>There will be hurdles to jump in this production, but the one thing I can say about this team, is that they have a can-do attitude.  If an obstacle is thrown in our path, we consider ourselves creative enough to figure a way around the obstacle.  And sometimes the path around is more interesting that our original intention!<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute, but still want to help, please, please, please, get the word out to your friends, neighbors, significant other, and his/her friends, your church group, your Facebook friends. If you live in or around NYC, please come to see the show, and bring your friends!  I guarantee, even if you've seen a lot of live theater before, this experience will be different, unique, something you've never seen before. <br/></p>

We will be exploring the history of protest and struggle through text and song, looking at the ongoing desire for freedom - freedom to be. To be black, to be LBGT, to be a woman, to be young, to be whatever you are and to believe in whatever you want. We will be working with the Devas Youth Club (South London). Over a period of eight days, eight members of NitroVoX will be working with 8-10 members of the club who will be contributing to and helping to create the piece.

<p>“Dry with a Twist” is taken from how our founding director

this we find our philosophy of theatre. We feel that theatre should be like a

<p><i>When the Cat’s Away</i> is a brand new comedy that tells the story of the
Sea Hawk Inn on Nantucket Island. Its proprietor, Henry Gooding, disappeared at
sea a year ago, and in his absence his son, Matthew, with the help of his
cousin, Mark, has been throwing wild parties. Mrs. Wilder, the nosy neighbor of
the Sea Hawk Inn, has had enough of the noise and Mark and Matthew are faced
with eviction on the day they have planned their biggest party, a “midsummer
masquerade”. Things become complicated when Iolana, a virginal courtesan, and
her identical twin sister, Anastasia, arrive and fall in love with Matthew and Mark;
the ever tipsy Luke and Lucille get into a jealous spat and Henry returns from
sea. It is a madcap farce about sand, sorrow, and silliness which will receive

</div><p>Nancy Evans Dance Theatre (NEDT) is a collection of dance artists telling stories through movement under the artistic direction of Nancy Evans Doede. Our work exposes us—dancers and audience members—as imperfect, vulnerable, sometimes ludicrous… humans. <i>Sweet Sorrow</i>, an evening-length collaboration with guest choreographer and novelist Leigh Purtill, is the next step in our evolution as creators and performers. </p>
<p>
</p><p>NEDT is raising funds to create the first phase of <i>Sweet Sorrow</i>. Using the language of dance we explore what becomes of Shakespeare’s <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> after their deaths. It is a dramatic contemporary ballet that explores the beauty of undying love in stark contrast to the gruesome embodiment of jealousy, revenge, and power. </p>
<p>

<p>Tell your friends! Did we mention this is a ballet with zombies?!</p><br/><p></p></div>","Nancy Evans Dance Theatre (NEDT) is a collection of dance artists telling stories through movement under the artistic direction of Nancy Evans Doede. Our work exposes us—dancers and audience members—as imperfect, vulnerable, sometimes ludicrous… humans. Sweet Sorrow, an evening-length collaboration with guest choreographer and novelist Leigh Purtill, is the next step in our evolution as creators and performers. 

NEDT is raising funds to create the first phase of Sweet Sorrow. Using the language of dance we explore what becomes of Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet after their deaths. It is a dramatic contemporary ballet that explores the beauty of undying love in stark contrast to the gruesome embodiment of jealousy, revenge, and power. 

This new work is a media cross-over that blends story, theatre, improv, visual arts, design, and dance. NEDT is thrilled to be working with choreographer Leigh Purtill (original story & concept) and costume designer Jordan Waterman. 

NEDT aims to produce Act One of Sweet Sorrow in May of 2015 (May 29, 30 at 8PM & 31 at 4PM), with an evening length debut in the Fall of 2016.Read more about the collaborative process from the choreographer's perspective.The Cast

<p>Social
responsibility does not exempt from the obligation of individual
responsibility. Let’s create art together, with the city’s most progressive
company, in the city’s most open-minded theatre.</p>
<p>011
Production Group and Atrium Film-Theatre would like to collaborate on the
premiere of Patrick Marber’s <i>Closer</i>,
to be directed by the young Hungarian artist, Márk Radnai (26). The production
will be the continuation of our two-year-old collaboration. 011 collects
young, creative actors, artists, filmmakers, and designers, whom the management
of Atrium Film-Theatre thinks important to support. The English playwright’s
play premiered in 1997 in London; making Marber and his work immediately
world-renowned. Since then, the play had been on the program of several
Hungarian theatres.</p>
<p>Responsible
for the program production in Atrium Film-Theatre is the English Language
Theatre Charitable Foundation, which tends to its philanthropic cultural
activity since 1991. With its programs and genre-diversity, the cultural center
in Buda functions as a professional and local meeting point and host theatre. The
program is made up by contemporary Hungarian and international theatre, dance,
classical music, film, and fine art. For Atrium Film-Theatre, it is of utmost
importance to assist contemporary young directors in staging their new
projects. For the staging of this production – besides own and sponsorship
resources – 011 Production Group and Atrium Film-Theatre would like to set up an Indiegogo project for the first time in their joint history to acquire the
necessary funds.</p>
<p>With
supporting our project, you contribute to…</p>
<p>- a young
group working with new artistic methods and representing a fresh trend to
prepare their next premiere</p>
<p>- helping young
artists to produce the funds necessary for their work with an independent
campaign</p>
<p>- furthermore,
you get involved with the creation of a theatre performance</p>

<h3>
<b>Synopsis of the play</b>
</h3>
<p>Patrick
Marber’s play is about love, the desire to own each other, and revenge, and
shows it through the story of four people. It is the love rectangle of two men and two women, where fundamentally
lonesome and interdependent people look for happiness and fulfillment in each
other, trying to redeem their own lives through one another.</p>
<p>In London a
taxi accidentally hits a girl, who introduces herself to the passenger of the
taxi as Alice when he is taking her to the hospital. Dan, who wants to be a
journalist and works for a newspaper’s obituary column, is immediately
mesmerized by the girl’s straightforwardness and strong sexual aura. Alice has
just arrived at home from New York where she was working as a stripper. Dan
writes a novel based on the girl’s story, and he does a photoshoot for
publicity where he meets the older and less vulnerable Anna. Dan is unable to
get Anna out of his head, so he starts writing in the photographer’s name on a
sex-chat page to Larry, the doctor, who is dumbstruck by the dirty-mouthed
erotica that Dan beleaguers him with. Dan goes even further: he arranges a date
with the doctor in Anna’s name to an aquarium he knows is Anna’s favorite
place…</p>
<p>The plot
takes place in London where the photographer, the stripper, the writer, and the
doctor fatalistically meet. They keep cheating on each other, and they are
cheated on, too. Love is vital to them, but only if they cannot get it. If it
is at hand, it’s not exciting anymore.<br/></p>

<h3>About 
<b>011 Production Group </b>
</h3>
<div>
<p>Every
theatre production has to create a unique world, system in which the spectator
can recognise the events important for him through a series of partial truths;
he can put the pieces together like in a puzzle. A good theatre is like the
rabbit’s hole for us, where space and time changes every minute, where the
actor turns into something different, he is a machine, a plant, an animal and
human, statue and animation. Where the memories of our subconscious are
connected to the main storyline with a thousand threads, where the numerous
manifestations of the world around us can be animated within moments. Where in
a concentrated moment I can feel the pouring rain, last year’s love, the
fantasy comics or my latest family meal. Where the scenes don’t follow each
other in a linear way, but every small unit can stand on its own as an
individual vision, social message or even just an impression, but if I want, I
can add to the plot by simply creating a story and going on writing my own story.
The question ‘what is this scene or sentence doing here?’ cannot come up in
theatre. It has to create a system in which these specks of dust roll by
themselves and I can either identify myself with them or they disturb me. If
the theatre doesn’t carry this kind of freedom, this kind of interpretation
network, then it becomes predictable and transparent. </p>

<p>Since the founding of 011 Production Group
they have created productions in a wide variety of genres. What connect them
are the modern, non-conventional film-like narratives and visuals, furthermore,
the experimentation with technologies not fundamentally connected to theatre. There
is no company behind the group, though mostly they work with the same group of
young actors in their productions. The members of the creative team are: Márk
Radnai, director; Renátó Cseh, designer; and Ambrus Ivanyos, dramaturge. The
performances aren’t usually created from already existing plays, but are
written by the creative team, using actors’ improvisations, situation
practices, and outside sources to create the script. The younger generation
follows the production group’s work closely, as well. Another thing that makes
011 Production Group exceptional is that they create unique promotion campaigns
for each of their performances. They have organised the first 011 Festival
between 7-11 June, 2014, in Budapest.</p>

<h3>About 
<b>Atrium Film-Theatre </b>
</h3>
<p>Atrium Film-Theatre
is a cultural center and theatre. The beautiful art deco building of Atrium was
reborn after 12 years of neglect, with a new function and a new vocation. It was
converted into a theatre, café, and community place, where art meets
entertainment and quality leisure time. Its programs include contemporary Hungarian
and international theatre, dance, and music performances; films and fine art.
Besides offering public relations and artistic, technical, and financial
support for artists, Atrium also stages its own productions every year,
participates in theatre and performance festivals, and cooperates with cultural
institutions. Atrium hosted „bEUgró” festival with almost 1500 performers, held
as part of the jubilee celebrations of Hungary joining the European Union in
2004. Atrium’s current director, László Magács supervised the event.</p>
<p>Atrium opened its
gates in October 2012, in Budapest. Atrium is a good example of how a civil
association can build a new financial model to effectuate a cultural institute.
Atrium’s funds come mostly from ticket sales and sponsorships, which give the
financial base for the 10-13 premieres per season, the assistance to host
several independent theatre companies, and to house around 250 performances and
almost 60,000 visitors each year. Our technical facilities, the capacity, and
the professional catering personnel make Atrium an ideal venue for various
events in a wide variety of styles and forms. Atrium invites young artists, dramaturges,
actors, directors, and designers to collaborate on projects. Atrium is open to artistic
projects that discuss important social topics, such as gender issues, violence,
social changes, and exclusion in Hungary. Both entertainment and education are
an important part of the artistic concept, as well as offering a place for
local and professional communities. The staff is skilled for both working on
hosted shows, as well as on original productions, with an entire artistic crew
at the ready.</p>
<p>Atrium is an
important platform for international collaborations, utilizing the different
areas of performing arts to create new productions. Film, contemporary visual
culture, and the elements of theatre combined create the unique image of
Atrium. The 20-years-old relationships of Merlin Theatre (the previous
institute run by the foundation), and the European and American collaborations
help us exhibit the most contemporary, new theatrical directions and successes
in Budapest.</p>

011
Production Group and Atrium Film-Theatre would like to collaborate on the
premiere of Patrick Marber’s Closer,
to be directed by the young Hungarian artist, Márk Radnai (26). The production
will be the continuation of our two-year-old collaboration. 011 collects
young, creative actors, artists, filmmakers, and designers, whom the management
of Atrium Film-Theatre thinks important to support. The English playwright’s
play premiered in 1997 in London; making Marber and his work immediately
world-renowned. Since then, the play had been on the program of several
Hungarian theatres.
Responsible
for the program production in Atrium Film-Theatre is the English Language
Theatre Charitable Foundation, which tends to its philanthropic cultural
activity since 1991. With its programs and genre-diversity, the cultural center
in Buda functions as a professional and local meeting point and host theatre. The
program is made up by contemporary Hungarian and international theatre, dance,
classical music, film, and fine art. For Atrium Film-Theatre, it is of utmost
importance to assist contemporary young directors in staging their new
projects. For the staging of this production – besides own and sponsorship
resources – 011 Production Group and Atrium Film-Theatre would like to set up an Indiegogo project for the first time in their joint history to acquire the
necessary funds.
With
supporting our project, you contribute to…
- a young
group working with new artistic methods and representing a fresh trend to
prepare their next premiere
- helping young
artists to produce the funds necessary for their work with an independent
campaign
- furthermore,
you get involved with the creation of a theatre performance
Premiere: 11th May, 2015. Budapest, Atrium Film-Theatre







Synopsis of the play

Patrick
Marber’s play is about love, the desire to own each other, and revenge, and
shows it through the story of four people. It is the love rectangle of two men and two women, where fundamentally
lonesome and interdependent people look for happiness and fulfillment in each
other, trying to redeem their own lives through one another.
In London a
taxi accidentally hits a girl, who introduces herself to the passenger of the
taxi as Alice when he is taking her to the hospital. Dan, who wants to be a
journalist and works for a newspaper’s obituary column, is immediately
mesmerized by the girl’s straightforwardness and strong sexual aura. Alice has
just arrived at home from New York where she was working as a stripper. Dan
writes a novel based on the girl’s story, and he does a photoshoot for
publicity where he meets the older and less vulnerable Anna. Dan is unable to
get Anna out of his head, so he starts writing in the photographer’s name on a
sex-chat page to Larry, the doctor, who is dumbstruck by the dirty-mouthed
erotica that Dan beleaguers him with. Dan goes even further: he arranges a date
with the doctor in Anna’s name to an aquarium he knows is Anna’s favorite
place…
The plot
takes place in London where the photographer, the stripper, the writer, and the
doctor fatalistically meet. They keep cheating on each other, and they are
cheated on, too. Love is vital to them, but only if they cannot get it. If it
is at hand, it’s not exciting anymore.

Welcome to our Indiegogo page!
We would like to thank you for visiting our page and taking an interest in our project.  As you will see from our video, we already had a trial run of our show last year and it went very well. Our aim is to build a following for the show and we need your help to take the show to the Fringe. We are a hard working, well organised team with a talented cast and hilarious script and with your help we can make our run at the Fringe, a roaring success.
   What We Need & What You Get •	We have been working on this show for over a year now, getting the script just right by trialling the show in front of an audience and getting feedback from The Comedy Unit and Channel 4 Comedy. Your contributions will help us take it to the next level.
•	We have a professional team of make up artists, stage production crew and actors and as well as paying for production and promotion of the show we need to make sure these guys are fed and watered and have somewhere to rest their head during their time at the Fringe. Your contributions can help make that happen. 
• As we have already produced the show last year, we have the advantage of having our set, props and costumes all ready to go but we still need to pay for a theatre venue, insurance, registration costs, advertising, travel, accommodation and expenses. 

• We will be doing our best to fill the theatre and sell as many tickets as possible  but the Fringe is an expensive festival and even if we sell out our shows there is no guarantee we will be able to cover our expenses. Which is why we need money raised from crowdfunding and sponsors to help us cover the costs.

•	We hope that our unique perks will encourage you to part with your hard earned cash, some examples of these are: a sneak peek at our latest feature film ""The Bench"" before anyone else, VIP treatment and playing the dead body in the opening act of the show – and even a private performance of the show in your living room!

•	We also want to say that we will use all donations with the greatest of care and gratitude.

I have started the casting process and most of the actors I've spoken to are will to do the show without compensation so that would be the first place to cut money from the budget. Some of the production team and crew are also willing to take a cut in pay if necessary. I can also cut down on the advertising budget.

<div>Dex! the killer musical is an all-volunteer team of NYC based theater professionals with one thing in common - a love of Dexter. We want to share this project with fans across the world and we need your help! After a successful set of Cabaret performances at ""<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/813927642027589/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Times Scare</a>"" and ""<a href=""http://54below.com/artist/dex-a-killer-musical/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">54 Below</a>"" ""Dex!"" has been accepted to the <a href=""http://www.eventbrite.com/e/dex-a-killer-musical-the-unauthorized-parody-of-dexter-fringenyc-tickets-17730146345"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">NYC Fringe Festival</a> for 5 performances at the Lynn Redgrave Theater with prospects for an off-broadway run. This is where you come in! Browse the list of incentives to the right, and find out how you can share in the fun. From blood-slide keychains to signed posters from our wondeful cast, we're hoping to bring ""Dex!"" to fans everywhere. We even have ways to bring the show to you! </div>
<div><br/></div>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Since we're an all volunteer team, expenses are tight - crowdfunding has become an excellent way to spread word and show producers that a show has legs. We all passionately believe in ""Dex!"" and need your help to spread the word. By donating at least $5, you're joining ""Team Dex!"" and letting us know you want to see Dex! up in lights!</p>
<p>Donate higher and there's all kinds of excellent rewards waiting for you. Can't make it to the big apple for the bloodfest in person? No problem! Since all work on the show (to date) has been the work of fans like you - we have full rights to share the songs and performances with the backers of our work - including the upcoming fringe festival performance!</p>
<p>We are also excited to announce that <a href=""http://elektratheater.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the Elektra Theater</a> is willing to host ""Dex!"" for an off-broadway run (following the closing of the <a href=""http://50shadesthemusical.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">50 Shades parody musical</a> and <a href=""http://www.silencethemusical.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Silence! the musical</a>) but for that we need to realize the show. NYC Fringe shows the world we have a show and our next step is getting it produced.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Impact</h3> <p>Producing an off-broadway show requires multiple departments working together to make it a success. From costumes, lights, scenery, props, sound, video &amp; management - the list goes on and on. Each department needs resources. By donating to ""Dex!"" -  you're not only helping make a grassroots musical come to life - but you're also helping add resources to the toolkits of each department, which attracts better talent for our show and ultimately, makes it that much more impressive.</p>
<p>Additionally, with the advent of crowdfunding - the show stays in the hands of those who helped make it come to life. Instead of one or two large producers coming in with big wallets and calling all the shots, by raising the money socially, we get to keep ""Dex!"" in the hands of the fans.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3 style=""text-align: center;""><br/></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Producing theater always carries the risk of flopping. Not getting the word out, bad PR, weak performances or scripts - these all contribute to the reasons a show may or may not take. Buzz is already in the air however for Dex! to be a hit and with your help we can spread the word and ensure we get the butts in seats we need to make the show a hit</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div style=""text-align: center;""> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Share this campaign with your friends and fellow fans! No contribution is too small. Tweet about it, share it on your Facebook wall, Reddit about your passion for musical theater and blood and help spread the word! </p>

</div></div>","Who are We?
Dex! the killer musical is an all-volunteer team of NYC based theater professionals with one thing in common - a love of Dexter. We want to share this project with fans across the world and we need your help! After a successful set of Cabaret performances at ""Times Scare"" and ""54 Below"" ""Dex!"" has been accepted to the NYC Fringe Festival for 5 performances at the Lynn Redgrave Theater with prospects for an off-broadway run. This is where you come in! Browse the list of incentives to the right, and find out how you can share in the fun. From blood-slide keychains to signed posters from our wondeful cast, we're hoping to bring ""Dex!"" to fans everywhere. We even have ways to bring the show to you! 


What We Need & What You Get Since we're an all volunteer team, expenses are tight - crowdfunding has become an excellent way to spread word and show producers that a show has legs. We all passionately believe in ""Dex!"" and need your help to spread the word. By donating at least $5, you're joining ""Team Dex!"" and letting us know you want to see Dex! up in lights!
Donate higher and there's all kinds of excellent rewards waiting for you. Can't make it to the big apple for the bloodfest in person? No problem! Since all work on the show (to date) has been the work of fans like you - we have full rights to share the songs and performances with the backers of our work - including the upcoming fringe festival performance!
We are also excited to announce that the Elektra Theater is willing to host ""Dex!"" for an off-broadway run (following the closing of the 50 Shades parody musical and Silence! the musical) but for that we need to realize the show. NYC Fringe shows the world we have a show and our next step is getting it produced.

    The Impact Producing an off-broadway show requires multiple departments working together to make it a success. From costumes, lights, scenery, props, sound, video & management - the list goes on and on. Each department needs resources. By donating to ""Dex!"" -  you're not only helping make a grassroots musical come to life - but you're also helping add resources to the toolkits of each department, which attracts better talent for our show and ultimately, makes it that much more impressive.
Additionally, with the advent of crowdfunding - the show stays in the hands of those who helped make it come to life. Instead of one or two large producers coming in with big wallets and calling all the shots, by raising the money socially, we get to keep ""Dex!"" in the hands of the fans.
    
Risks & Challenges Producing theater always carries the risk of flopping. Not getting the word out, bad PR, weak performances or scripts - these all contribute to the reasons a show may or may not take. Buzz is already in the air however for Dex! to be a hit and with your help we can spread the word and ensure we get the butts in seats we need to make the show a hit

    Other Ways You Can Help Share this campaign with your friends and fellow fans! No contribution is too small. Tweet about it, share it on your Facebook wall, Reddit about your passion for musical theater and blood and help spread the word!",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

...ED ORA VI ASPETTIAMO A VEDERE LO SPETTACOLO!
                                             Beyond Vanja al Teatro Litta

Il Progetto 
Una rilettura nuova, in chiave contemporanea del capolavoro “Zio Vanja”
senza snaturarne le tematiche, il clima e la storia che Cechov ci ha trasmesso
attraverso i suoi testi.


Perché scegliere un  testo classico in un periodo storico dove siamo
idealmente sempre più spinti verso la drammaturgia contemporanea?
Primo su tutti la voglia di raccontare l'identità dell'uomo, attraverso i
personaggi cechoviani, nei quali ritroviamo una contemporaneità disarmante.
Secondo motivo, non meno importante del primo, il rinnovare una scelta già
proposta in altre occasioni, il voler sperimentare partendo dall’elaborazione
drammaturgica anche attraverso la sottrazione di alcuni personaggi; ciò non si
traduce nella loro assenza, ma al contrario essi sono presenti nelle parole e
nel pensiero degli altri.
C'è inoltre la volontà di proseguire il percorso che il Teatro del Simposio
ha intrapreso, ossia quello di contaminare i nostri lavori con altre forme espressive,
come l’arte performativa, l’installazione, il lighting design. In tale contesto la
scelta del titolo, “Beyond Vanja”, indica proprio questa necessità di
andare oltre la semplice trasposizione del testo, cercando invece nuove forme
di rappresentazione senza mai tradire l’essenza delle atmosfere e delle
tematiche. 

Il tuo contributo potrà
coprire i costi relativi a 
·  riconoscimento agli attori per le prove, 
·  riconoscimento per l'aiuto regia, 

·  consulenze per la scenografia, 
·  consulenze per i costumi,
· 
consulenze per il lighting design,
·  scenografie, 
·  costumi,
·  materiali di scena,
·  oneri organizzativi.
Vogliamo che sia sostenuto da coloro che amano il teatro, l'arte, la
cultura, ciò che ci rende migliori. Ragioni sufficienti per aiutarci a
realizzare questo nostro progetto che sarà presentato a in prima nazionale a
novembre a Milano, al teatro Litta (sala La Cavallerizza, dal 17 al 27
novembre) 
Vi chiediamo di sostenere il nostro progetto, perché pensiamo che il modo
migliore per aiutare il teatro italiano, in special modo chi lo fa basandosi
solo sulle proprie forze ed entusiasmo, sia quello di fare gruppo, seguire la
realizzazione di uno spettacolo in maniera attiva, e assistere poi alla messa
in scena finale. 
Soprattutto, potrai essere felice di aver
contribuito a tenere ancora vivo il teatro che si autoproduce.

<h2>BuSSy's Birth </h2>
<div>In 2005, the American University in Cairo hosted a performance of the Vagina Monologues. Many female students felt the performance was daring but irrelevant to Egyptians. And in reaction to that ... BuSSy was born!</div>
<p>In 2006, a group of female students started The BuSSy project; An annual performance of true Stories of Women in Egypt.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> The very first BuSSy performance was a collection of Stories submitted by women in response to a </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">flyer that read: “If you have a story about yourself or a woman you know, please pick up a submission form and share it"". </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The monologues, which were written and performed by women, for women, exposed real women’s stories and provided for the first time in Egypt, a space for free expression on issues that society often failed/refused to address. </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Despite  being constantly subjected to censorship attempts from both the Private theaters and state owned ones, BuSSy was able to carry on and expand further.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">In 2010 the project developed its scope to include stories of both women and men. Both genders are invited to share their personal experiences during the workshop and later on stage. </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">In 2012, we began working on a larger scale, instead of one workshop and one performance. We started conducting several workshops around Cairo to produce different performances each year that include stories of both genders. Some of the performances and workshops revolved around specific timely/relevant themes such as: harassment incidents during protests and domestic violence. </span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> In 2013 and 2014 BuSSy travelled to different cities in Egypt to hold community based storytelling workshops and performances. BuSSy also performed and participated in different conferences and festivals in different countries. </span></p>
<p><b>Since 2006 we have...<br/></b></p>
<p>...Held <b>40</b> storytelling workshops...</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">...Performed in Cairo, Alexandria, Minya, Assiut, Port Said...</span></p>
<p>...Held more than <b>20</b> performances for women by women in Egypt...</p>
<p>...Gathered stories from over <b>500</b> people...</p>
<p>...Reached Thousands of others online and through our performances...</p>

<p>""Bussy""--which means ""look!"" in Egyptian Arabic-- provides not only a space, but also, opportunities for individuals to<i> look</i> within themselves.</p>
<div>Ever since it's birth BuSSy has been facing a lot of difficulties finding spaces to hold the workshops and rehearsals. </div>
<div>We have held workshops and rehearsals in school court yards, garages, flats, public cafe, rented rooms, bookshops ... </div>
<div><span>For BuSSy to continue to share with the world the remarkable histories of our storytellers, we need a safe and open space to hold our workshops, create other activities that would help sustain the project on the long run, and help it operate independently away from censorship and content-controlling funding – which is commonly practiced by hosting venues. </span></div>

</div></div>","BuSSy's Story  
BuSSy is a performing arts project/movement that documents and gives voice to censored untold stories about gender in different communities in Egypt.
BuSSy challenges Egypt's social boundaries. Women step on stage to share stories about harassment, rape, gender discrimination, honor killing, forced marriage, Female genital mutilation, motherhood, domestic violence, child abuse, mass sexual assaults  and many others, from different communities and cities in Egypt.





BuSSy's Birth 
In 2005, the American University in Cairo hosted a performance of the Vagina Monologues. Many female students felt the performance was daring but irrelevant to Egyptians. And in reaction to that ... BuSSy was born!
In 2006, a group of female students started The BuSSy project; An annual performance of true Stories of Women in Egypt. The very first BuSSy performance was a collection of Stories submitted by women in response to a flyer that read: “If you have a story about yourself or a woman you know, please pick up a submission form and share it"". 
The monologues, which were written and performed by women, for women, exposed real women’s stories and provided for the first time in Egypt, a space for free expression on issues that society often failed/refused to address. 
Despite  being constantly subjected to censorship attempts from both the Private theaters and state owned ones, BuSSy was able to carry on and expand further.
In 2010 the project developed its scope to include stories of both women and men. Both genders are invited to share their personal experiences during the workshop and later on stage. 

In 2012, we began working on a larger scale, instead of one workshop and one performance. We started conducting several workshops around Cairo to produce different performances each year that include stories of both genders. Some of the performances and workshops revolved around specific timely/relevant themes such as: harassment incidents during protests and domestic violence. 
 In 2013 and 2014 BuSSy travelled to different cities in Egypt to hold community based storytelling workshops and performances. BuSSy also performed and participated in different conferences and festivals in different countries. 
Since 2006 we have...
...Held 40 storytelling workshops...
...Performed in Cairo, Alexandria, Minya, Assiut, Port Said...
...Held more than 20 performances for women by women in Egypt...
...Gathered stories from over 500 people...
...Reached Thousands of others online and through our performances...


""Bussy""--which means ""look!"" in Egyptian Arabic-- provides not only a space, but also, opportunities for individuals to look within themselves.
Ever since it's birth BuSSy has been facing a lot of difficulties finding spaces to hold the workshops and rehearsals. 
We have held workshops and rehearsals in school court yards, garages, flats, public cafe, rented rooms, bookshops ... 
For BuSSy to continue to share with the world the remarkable histories of our storytellers, we need a safe and open space to hold our workshops, create other activities that would help sustain the project on the long run, and help it operate independently away from censorship and content-controlling funding – which is commonly practiced by hosting venues. 


A Place for Stories...A Place for BuSSy 
“A Place For Stories” campaign will be used to provide an office workshop and rehearsal space in Cairo for:


Storytelling workshops
Performance Rehearsals
BuSSy's Administrative and planning team
Income generating activities such as film screening, storytelling, writing and theater workshops. 
Host individual storytelling sessions with men and women
filming and editing different stories and testimonies 
Serve as offices for BuSSy’s growing team and a home for BuSSy's growing family ... 

Your support will help BuSSy become sustainable. Your contributions will fund a work space and necessary equipment that will help us reduce long-term operating overheads and create revenue streams that will make BuSSy self-financing movement after 2 years.

حكاية بـــُــصى
بصي هو مشروع فنى يهدف إلى تمكين السيدات والرجال المصريين، ورفع الوعى حول مشاكل النوع الإجتماعي من خلال الحكي المسرحي.
بصي تحاول مقاومة القيود المجتمعية فى مصر. السيدات في مختلف المجتمعات والمدن المصرية يقفن على خشبة المسرح لمشاركة حكاياتهم عن التحرش والإغتصاب، والتمييز، وجرائم الشرف، والزواج القهري، والختان، والأمومة، والعنف الأسرى، والاعتداء الجنسي على الأطفال، والإعتداء الجنسي الجماعي، وغيرها من الموضوعات التى يصنفها المجتمع كتابوهات ممنوع الكلام عنها.
بداية بــُـــصى
فى 2005، استضافة الجامعة الأمريكية بالقاهرة عرض The Vagina Monologues.
العديد من الطالبات شعرن أن العرض جرىء لكنه لا يعبر عن المصريات، وكان رد الفعل على ذلك ... ميلاد بصى!
فى 2006، بدأت مجموعة من الطالبات مشروع بصى؛ عرض سنوى لحكايات فتيات وسيدات من مصر. العرض الأول لمشروع بصي كان لحكايات مجمعة أرسلتها سيدات ردًا على منشور كُتب فيه: ""لو عندك قصة عن نفسك أو سيده تعرفينها، برجاء سحب استمارة ومشاركتنا القصة"".
ولأول مرة في مصر، المونولوجات التى كتبتها وحكتها نساء، أظهرت حكايات حقيقية، وقامت بتوفير مساحة حرة للتعبير عن مشكلات فشل المجتمع أو رفض، الاعتراف بها.
على الرغم من استمرار تعرض المشروع للمشكلات الرقابية، في المسارح الحكومية والخاصة، إلا أن بصي استطاعت أن تستمر وتتطور.
في 2010، تطور المشروع ليتضمن حكايات نساء ورجال. ودعي المشروع النساء والرجال لمشاركة مشكلاتهم الشخصية والتعبير عنها في ورش الحكي، وعلى المسرح لاحقًا.
فى 2012، بدأنا في توسيع مجال عملنا. بدلًا من ورشة واحدة وعرض واحد فى السنة، بدأنا في عقد العديد من الورش في مختلف مناطق القاهرة، للخروج بأكثر من عرض يتضمن حكايات نساء ورجال. بعض الورش والعروض تركزت حول تجارب متعلقة بموضوع بعينه مثل: حوادث التحرش الجنسي أثناء المظاهرات، والعنف المنزلي.
في 2013 و 2014، سافرت بصي إلى العديد من المدن في مصر لعمل ورش حكي وعروض خاصة بكل مدينة؛ كما شاركت بصي في العديد من المؤتمرات والمهرجانات الدولية.
منذ 2006 قمنا بعمل
40 ورشة حكي ...
عروض في القاهرة والإسكندرية والمنيا وأسيوط وبورسعيد...
أكثر من 20 عرض للنساء، بطلاته نساء في مصر ...
جمعنا أكثر من 500 حكاية...
منذ بداية ""بصي"" والمشروع يواجه العديد من المشكلات في إيجاد أماكن لعقد ورش الحكي وبروفات  العروض.
قمنا بعمل ورش حكى وتدريبات فى ساحة مدرسة، وجراجات، وشقق أصدقاء، ومقاهي عامة، وغرف اجتماعات ومكتبات ... إلخ.
حتى تتمكن بصى من الاستمرار في الحكى والتوثيق، نحتاج لمساحة عمل.
مكان للحكايات... مكان بصى
 ""مكان للحكايات"" هى حملة لإيجاد مكان وتجهيزه في القاهرة حتى نتمكن من:
1-عقد واستضافة ورش الحكي
2-استضافة تدريبات وإستعدادات ما قبل عروض بصي
3-عقد لقاءات فردية مع نساء ورجال لتوثيق قصصهم فى سرية
4-  توفير مكاتب لفريق عمل بصي الادارى والفنى
5- استضافة جلسات حكى مفتوحة
6- عقد اجتماعات 
7- تنظيم أنشطة تساعد على دعم استمرارية المشروع مثل: ورش حكى ومسرح وكتابة، وعروض أفلام 
8- توثيق تجارب شخصية من خلال الفيديو",11.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Canada’s Magnetic North Theatre Festival is our
country’s only touring national theatre festival. For thirteen years we’ve been bringing
together audiences, artists, and theatre industry delegates from across Canada
and around the world to celebrate excellence and innovation in Canada
theatre. </p>
<p>Canada is producing world-class theatre, and sharing
it across the country is what makes us unique. Supported by our National Resource
Council, which includes members such as Sandra Oh and Marti Maraden, we make
our home in Ottawa and travel the Festival to a new host community every other
year. We’ve traveled to Edmonton, St. Johns, Vancouver, Kitchener-Waterloo,
Calgary, and Halifax. Next year we are heading to Whitehorse.  Then in 2017 we will return to Ottawa to celebrate our 15<sup>th</sup> Anniversary and Canada's sesquicentennial. Traveling allows us to share our passion for
Canadian theatre with new audiences across the country. </p>
<p><i>“Magnetic North had a huge impact in St.
John’s. It sold like gangbusters, invigorated our community’s taste for
theatre, [and] served as an affirmation for the work we had been doing in that
far off corner. That visit to St. John’s knit our community closer to each
other, and in turn, to the rest of the country”. </i></p>

</div>","We Believe Theatre Should Be Accessible and Engaging
Who We
Are
Canada’s Magnetic North Theatre Festival is our
country’s only touring national theatre festival. For thirteen years we’ve been bringing
together audiences, artists, and theatre industry delegates from across Canada
and around the world to celebrate excellence and innovation in Canada
theatre. 
Canada is producing world-class theatre, and sharing
it across the country is what makes us unique. Supported by our National Resource
Council, which includes members such as Sandra Oh and Marti Maraden, we make
our home in Ottawa and travel the Festival to a new host community every other
year. We’ve traveled to Edmonton, St. Johns, Vancouver, Kitchener-Waterloo,
Calgary, and Halifax. Next year we are heading to Whitehorse.  Then in 2017 we will return to Ottawa to celebrate our 15th Anniversary and Canada's sesquicentennial. Traveling allows us to share our passion for
Canadian theatre with new audiences across the country. 
“Magnetic North had a huge impact in St.
John’s. It sold like gangbusters, invigorated our community’s taste for
theatre, [and] served as an affirmation for the work we had been doing in that
far off corner. That visit to St. John’s knit our community closer to each
other, and in turn, to the rest of the country”. 
-
Jillian Keiley, Artistic Director, National Arts Centre English Theatre
What We're Doing

We’re running this campaign to bring
Guerrilla Theatre to Ottawa, ON during our upcoming Festival, running from June
4th to 13th , 2015. 
Our Guerrilla theatre program lets us create
performances that are accessible to everyone, engaging, and fun! Through short
pop-up performances in public spaces, Guerrilla Theatre artists engage
passers-by in the spontaneity and surprise of theatre, exposing them to the
creative process in a personal and exciting way.Your support will make it possible for 8 local theatre artists to take their
shows to the streets of Ottawa during our festival this June. Our artists will create short (5 - 10 minute) pop-up theatre pieces to be performed on the streets, on buses, in shopping malls—essentially anywhere
people gather.

These performances will create art in unexpected
places for everyone to enjoy, and animate public spaces, turning your everyday
walk or commute from ordinary to extraordinary, all while giving local artists
the opportunity to display their talent and passion for theatre in an exciting
way. 
Our goal of $5000 will allow us to:


Employ 8
     local theatre artists/companies


We
      will select 4 pieces to be performed multiple times during the
      Festival, which runs from June 4th to 13th 
An
      additional 4 pieces will be chosen to be performed during Verso la Fiamma, (link) our outdoor
      walking carnival performance in the Byward Market on June 7th


Publicize
     the performances
Provide
     site specific support
Cover
     the costs of the campaign perks

If we exceed our goal we will be able to pay our
performers a higher rate.

funds from other programs to make sure these Guerrilla Theatre
performances happen.  With your support we hope we won't have to do that.What

<div>We are the Manayunk Theatre Company, a small non-profit theatre in the Manayunk neighborhood of Philadelphia. After the success of our first performance during the 2014 Philadelphia Fringe Festival (fully funded by our community), we're excited to bring you a new show, the US premiere of Paul Shapera's <i>The Dolls of New Albion</i>. The production will run from September 3 to 12 for eight showings at the Venice Island Performing Arts Center in Manayunk, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</div>

</p>
<p><b>Not familiar with
Steampunk?  We'll get you up to speed.</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Steampunk is an aesthetic and a lifestyle bringing together Victorian Era culture with
elaborate machine-powered technology. Everything is exquisitely
detailed and centered around a maker-culture.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433735233/lqjvdkt29rcrvo5boecm.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 517.962382445141px; height: 410px; cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>
<p><b>So now that
you're more familiar with what Steampunk is, we'll tell you a little bit
more about our latest project.</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i>The Dolls of New
Albion</i> is a Steampunk Opera. The show revolves around the soul of a
human being that is trapped in a mechanical artifice. The show grapples with  the
questions of: What is a human? What is humanity? What are our needs? How
do we define ourselves? These questions are explored through a drama of romance, heartbreak, and death.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433735525/jmhr25ulaicaahzkebkp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p><b>So you know a little bit about the company and about the show, but what about the details? What
will you be paying for?</b>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We are committed to
bringing the best possible performance to you, but we'll need your
support. First, we would like to rent a 250-person seat theatre at the Venice Island Performing Arts Center. Second, the show needs actors, and we at Manayunk Theatre Company value our
extraordinarily talented cast. Our actors are deserving of the best and we want to compensate them the most we can. This show also calls for intricate sets and detailed costumes and we plan to give you the best
possible performance with every detail well planned. With your help, we can hire a great team of designers, musicians, and
technicians who will help us bring this show to life.</p>

</div></div>","Welcome!

We are the Manayunk Theatre Company, a small non-profit theatre in the Manayunk neighborhood of Philadelphia. After the success of our first performance during the 2014 Philadelphia Fringe Festival (fully funded by our community), we're excited to bring you a new show, the US premiere of Paul Shapera's The Dolls of New Albion. The production will run from September 3 to 12 for eight showings at the Venice Island Performing Arts Center in Manayunk, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.


Not familiar with
Steampunk?  We'll get you up to speed.


Steampunk is an aesthetic and a lifestyle bringing together Victorian Era culture with
elaborate machine-powered technology. Everything is exquisitely
detailed and centered around a maker-culture.


So now that
you're more familiar with what Steampunk is, we'll tell you a little bit
more about our latest project.


The Dolls of New
Albion is a Steampunk Opera. The show revolves around the soul of a
human being that is trapped in a mechanical artifice. The show grapples with  the
questions of: What is a human? What is humanity? What are our needs? How
do we define ourselves? These questions are explored through a drama of romance, heartbreak, and death.



So you know a little bit about the company and about the show, but what about the details? What
will you be paying for?



We are committed to
bringing the best possible performance to you, but we'll need your
support. First, we would like to rent a 250-person seat theatre at the Venice Island Performing Arts Center. Second, the show needs actors, and we at Manayunk Theatre Company value our
extraordinarily talented cast. Our actors are deserving of the best and we want to compensate them the most we can. This show also calls for intricate sets and detailed costumes and we plan to give you the best
possible performance with every detail well planned. With your help, we can hire a great team of designers, musicians, and
technicians who will help us bring this show to life.



And last, but certainly not least, why does it
matter?



Manayunk Theatre Company loves to bring new and interesting pieces to
the community, and the Philadelphia Fringe Festival is a great way to
bring this show to fruition. The Dolls of New Albion is important to us for many reasons, and one of those reasons is Manayunk's industrial past. The Philadelphia Fringe Festival allows us
to celebrate that history and Steampunk culture as a whole. Steampunk's
maker-culture goes hand in hand with Theatre, which is filled with makers and doers.

insight into humanity itself. It's going to be an
audio-visual spectacle. I'm thrilled to bring Paul's vision to the stage.”

<p>
</p>
<p>Founded in 1959 by West Indian poet and Nobel Laureate Derek
Walcott and a group of Trinbagonian actors, Trinidad Theatre Workshop (TTW) is the longest running theatre company in the Caribbean. We have trained many of Trinidad's foremost actors, and educated students across the region, spawning a generation of leaders in the arts, locally, regionally and internationally. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""></span>
</p>
<p>Over
our 56 years of existence we have developed groundbreaking productions
which have toured extensively around the world, spreading Caribbean
theatre to a wide range of audiences from St. Lucia to Boston, Uganda to
Singapore. Our seasons reflect our diverse culture and its diaspora,
original local plays, as well as indigenous interpretations of global classics:
TTW's first season included Jean Genet's <i><b>The Blacks</b>, </i>Eric Roach's <i><b>Belle Fanto</b></i>, and Wole Soyinka's <i><b>The Road</b></i>. Over the years we have
performed acclaimed Walcott works, including <i><b>Joker of Seville</b></i>, commissioned by the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1974, and
productions of <i><b>Dream on Monkey
Mountain</b></i> and <i><b>Pantomime</b>, </i>both of which premiered in Trinidad. Elders of the
regional theatre arts, such as Errol Jones, Eunice Alleyne,
and Albert Laveau, our Artistic Director, have all passed through our
doors, as well as many emerging artists of today.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Through years of change and occasional upheaval, we have persevered in our pioneering work. We expanded our community outreach through the <b>School for the Arts</b>, founded in 1991, where we provide instruction in the dramatic arts to students of all ages, and our <b>Theatre in Education</b> programme, began in 1992, where we bring classic theatrical productions directly to schools across Trinidad &amp; Tobago. </p>
<p>Though we continue to be a creative home for so many, we have never had a permanent location from which to operate. Over the years we have moved from place to place, leasing various buildings, all the while continuing to produce quality work. Since 2004 we have been
renting a little blue house in Belmont, on the outskirts of Port of Spain, our capital city. Sitting near the creative heart of Trinidad and Tobago, where the arts have always been the centre of community life, this house is where we have built a black-box theatre and held countless classes, productions and events. This has been our longest home so far. Recently
our landlord offered us a chance to purchase this 100+ year old landmark, and we jumped at the
opportunity to finally claim a permanent place of our own. </p>
<p>This is where you join us on our journey. </p> </div> <div> <h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2> <p>We are trying to raise <b>$300,000 USD</b> to purchase our current building. All funds raised in this campaign will go directly towards buying the building from our current landlord. </p>
<p>Your donation will have far reaching effects that go beyond simple ownership. You are helping to uphold a major cultural institution, strengthen a historic tradition, and support a tight-knit family. As such, donors will receive a piece of our priceless legacy as a token of our thanks. </p>
<p>Prizes include limited edition posters from our numerous productions, signed copies of classic Caribbean plays, archival photographs from the early days, t-shirts, recordings of past productions, and much more. And, if we meet our initial goal of <b>$300,000 USD</b>, we have an incredible array of secret prizes that you can unlock for our stretch goals - but only if you donate today!</p>
<p>Please take a look at our perks list to see a more in depth description of our prizes and benefits for donors. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h2>The Impact: Furthering the Legacy</h2> <p></p>
</div>
<p>We are proud to develop productions and programmes that
showcase new and unheard voices of the Caribbean region, as well as its
diaspora. In a world with few avenues for people of color to share their
stories, TTW has been a pioneer and a model for others. TTW offers a critical
place for artists of color to not only grow, participate and lead in the arts,
but also to create vital work reflecting our communities, traditions,
concerns, and histories. In this way, we have been
providing a home where none previously existed, making art for us and by us. There are still few places where local playwrights, actors, technicians, designers, and first-time artists can develop their ideas and work in a supportive, nurturing environment. In order to continue offering such a crucial space, we need a permanent home-base.</p><h2>Risks and Challenges</h2><p>If we are unable to purchase our building, our work will remain unstable and tenuous, dictated by the whims of rising rent prices and economic change. Our reach will remain stunted and focused on only what we can afford. </p><p>Here in Trinidad &amp; Tobago, giving to the arts is often not a priority. In our mission to provide scholarships for deserving students and develop innovative work, we have a difficult time just meeting monthly operating costs. As a non-profit company with little financial returns, based in a small island nation, our ability to raise the adequate funds through shows, programmes, and local fundraising efforts alone is very limited. Only the combined support of our regional networks and a broader international audience will allow us to reach our goals.</p><p>We need your help so that a major Caribbean institution can push forward stronger than ever as a long standing leader in the contemporary theatre world. </p><h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2><div>
<div>
<div><div><div>
<div> <p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Other than your financial support and donations, we need your help in spreading the word widely. Our networks only reach so far, and we need as much exposure as possible if we want to achieve our goal.

We have trained many of Trinidad's foremost actors, and educated students across the region, spawning a generation of leaders in the arts, locally, regionally and internationally. 


Over
our 56 years of existence we have developed groundbreaking productions
which have toured extensively around the world, spreading Caribbean
theatre to a wide range of audiences from St. Lucia to Boston, Uganda to
Singapore. Our seasons reflect our diverse culture and its diaspora,
original local plays, as well as indigenous interpretations of global classics:
TTW's first season included Jean Genet's The Blacks, Eric Roach's Belle Fanto, and Wole Soyinka's The Road. Over the years we have
performed acclaimed Walcott works, including Joker of Seville, commissioned by the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1974, and
productions of Dream on Monkey
Mountain and Pantomime, both of which premiered in Trinidad. Elders of the
regional theatre arts, such as Errol Jones, Eunice Alleyne,
and Albert Laveau, our Artistic Director, have all passed through our
doors, as well as many emerging artists of today.


Through years of change and occasional upheaval, we have persevered in our pioneering work. We expanded our community outreach through the School for the Arts, founded in 1991, where we provide instruction in the dramatic arts to students of all ages, and our Theatre in Education programme, began in 1992, where we bring classic theatrical productions directly to schools across Trinidad & Tobago. 
Though we continue to be a creative home for so many, we have never had a permanent location from which to operate. Over the years we have moved from place to place, leasing various buildings, all the while continuing to produce quality work. Since 2004 we have been
renting a little blue house in Belmont, on the outskirts of Port of Spain, our capital city. Sitting near the creative heart of Trinidad and Tobago, where the arts have always been the centre of community life, this house is where we have built a black-box theatre and held countless classes, productions and events. This has been our longest home so far. Recently
our landlord offered us a chance to purchase this 100+ year old landmark, and we jumped at the
opportunity to finally claim a permanent place of our own. 
This is where you join us on our journey.    What We Need & What You Get We are trying to raise $300,000 USD to purchase our current building. All funds raised in this campaign will go directly towards buying the building from our current landlord. 
Your donation will have far reaching effects that go beyond simple ownership. You are helping to uphold a major cultural institution, strengthen a historic tradition, and support a tight-knit family. As such, donors will receive a piece of our priceless legacy as a token of our thanks. 
Prizes include limited edition posters from our numerous productions, signed copies of classic Caribbean plays, archival photographs from the early days, t-shirts, recordings of past productions, and much more. And, if we meet our initial goal of $300,000 USD, we have an incredible array of secret prizes that you can unlock for our stretch goals - but only if you donate today!
Please take a look at our perks list to see a more in depth description of our prizes and benefits for donors. 
    The Impact: Furthering the Legacy 

We are proud to develop productions and programmes that
showcase new and unheard voices of the Caribbean region, as well as its
diaspora. In a world with few avenues for people of color to share their
stories, TTW has been a pioneer and a model for others. TTW offers a critical
place for artists of color to not only grow, participate and lead in the arts,
but also to create vital work reflecting our communities, traditions,
concerns, and histories. In this way, we have been
providing a home where none previously existed, making art for us and by us. There are still few places where local playwrights, actors, technicians, designers, and first-time artists can develop their ideas and work in a supportive, nurturing environment. In order to continue offering such a crucial space, we need a permanent home-base.Risks and ChallengesIf we are unable to purchase our building, our work will remain unstable and tenuous, dictated by the whims of rising rent prices and economic change. Our reach will remain stunted and focused on only what we can afford. Here in Trinidad & Tobago, giving to the arts is often not a priority. In our mission to provide scholarships for deserving students and develop innovative work, we have a difficult time just meeting monthly operating costs. As a non-profit company with little financial returns, based in a small island nation, our ability to raise the adequate funds through shows, programmes, and local fundraising efforts alone is very limited. Only the combined support of our regional networks and a broader international audience will allow us to reach our goals.We need your help so that a major Caribbean institution can push forward stronger than ever as a long standing leader in the contemporary theatre world. Other Ways You Can Help


 Other than your financial support and donations, we need your help in spreading the word widely. Our networks only reach so far, and we need as much exposure as possible if we want to achieve our goal. If you are interested in supporting us in other ways, please do not hesitate to contact us directly here .",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

 But like all material on the web, you have to know what you are looking for to
 find it. The purpose of the Northwest Screendance Exposition is to create a
 greater awareness of this art form and build a community for it by taking it
 off the web and presenting it in the same immersive, theatrical context that
 builds community around other performance genres.Early Endorsements for the Expo include:

Edward Schiessl, Owner, Bijou Art CinemasRick Williams, Dean, Division of the Arts, Lane Community CollegeJeff Goolsby, Faculty Lead, Media Arts Program, Lane Community CollegeBonnie Simoa, Faculty Lead, Dance Program, Lane Community CollegeBrad Garner, Assistant Professor, Dance, University of Oregon; co-director, Harmonic Laboratory.

ROBOT - it just finished its run at the New Ohio Theatre, in New York City, to sold-out houses and nice reviews. We received a wonderful commission from Performance Space 122 to get it up and in front of people as part of their excellent COIL Festival. However, the thing has not even come close to paying for itself. It's like a teenager who refuses to get a job at this point and instead sits around at home playing video games, or maybe furiously knitting a cozy for something that doesn't need a cozy, like a futuristic telephone in a Keanu Reeves movie. You see where I'm going here.<br/><br/><b>No, This Part Is Really the Thing</b><br/><p>The play I wrote: SORRY ROBOT. 
It has eight songs in
it, and now, with the production's run behind us, we are hearing repeatedly that we need to make recordings of these songs available to our demanding and intensely sensory-deprived audience. <br/></p>More on this in a minute, but first, here is an example of a song in the play. It's called FEELINGS (EMOTIONAL FEELINGS). <br/><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F113395081&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F113395081&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F498697546_640.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><b>Why Though? No, Honestly, Why.</b><br/>PS122 has reached deep with this commission, part of their amazing Ethyl Eichelberger Award, and provided
funds that have allowed me to pay many astounding people - not super
generously, but adequately: performers Tanya Selvaratnam, Nicky Paraiso, and Anthony
R. Brown (standout luminaries all), the wonderful lighting designer Lucrecia
Briceno, the marvelous set and costume designer Parker Lutz, the incomparable
stage manager Maurina Lioce, and last but not least the incredible director, Will
Davis. But the commission can’t cover things like weeks of rehearsal space we needed to get this up and running, or
nominal fees for the many people who have stepped up to help out in rehearsal and
administratively, or the materials we used to make the visions of all these
hard-working brilliant thinkers come to life. <br/><br/>Plus, like I said above, the songs. Many wonderful people got to see the show and hear the songs in it - and many wonderful people didn't, because of its short run and the intimate nature of the awesome New Ohio (around 80 seats). Getting us out of debt for the first run for the show can hopefully put us in the position where we can get a remount of the show on its feet. And as a thank-you to our crazy-generous supporters who can help us do that, we are going to provide everyone who contributes downloads of some of the final-night live recordings of some of SORRY ROBOT's songs. <br/><br/>I'm going to reiterate this below, mostly to make sure that I actually did just write that. <b><br/><br/>And Now, a Final Attempt at Clarity</b><br/><br/>Okay, I'll say it again. A contribution of any amount gets you some downloads of a number of songs from the show -- ""Tears on the Treadmill"" and a couple others. Whew. Get it!<br/><br/>In closing, here's some more words.<br/><br/>This
 is my first full-length play. It builds on years of writing 
songs for performance art, dances, and plays, and of writing short plays and 
pieces of my own. It's pretty exciting to have to hold an audience's 
attention for a whole hour and a half. I feel like I've always been 
making singles and am now tackling a full LP. But not like a greatest 
hits, if we are going to ride this metaphor into the dirt. I think the 
songs in my show are great hits but as a whole it has the integrity of 
an LP, like, uh, Dusty in Memphis or Houses of the Holy. I would say OK 
Computer but I'm trying to distract your attention away from like 
technology ideas because my play is essentially about robots, and then 
you might start thinking about ""Mr. Roboto"" by Styx, and I encourage 
that but then someone's gonna say ""dad rock"" and then I'm going to have 
to emotionally abuse myself, for obvious reasons. <p></p>So do me a flavor, watch the video which provides some visuals to accompany one of the songs you can hear in SORRY ROBOT – and then see where you're at.<br/><br/>Your donations are tax-deductible to the extent provided by law.<br/><p></p><div>

<p><b><u>About the
Ethyl Eichelberger Award</u></b></p>
<p><span>Since
1995, PS122 has given this commissioning award annually to an artist or group
that exemplifies Eichelberger’s larger-than-life style and generosity of
spirit; that embodies his multi-talented artistic virtuosity, bridging worlds
and inspiring those around them. Each winner receives an initial $5,000
commission to create a new work along with full production support when the
work premieres. Previous winners of the award include Justin Vivian Bond, Julie
Atlas Muz, Peggy Shaw, among many others. The Ethyl Eichelberger award is made
possible by the generosity of the Gesso Foundation. </span></p>
<p>PS122 Artistic Director Vallejo Gantner commented
on Mike Iveson winning the 2013 award, “As an actor, writer, composer and
performance artist, Mike Iveson has been an essential collaborator with great
dance and theater artists. His generosity and goodwill is well known. My hope
is that the Ethyl Eichelberger Award will push Iveson to focus on his own
creative project. The award has a history of encouraging artists to commit to
their unique creative vision for the first time.”</p>

Ohio Theatre</u></b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>New Ohio Theatre is a
two-time OBIE Award-winning performance venue that serves the vast independent
theatre community of New York and the adventurous audiences who love them. As a
small, downtown, artist-run organization with a twenty-plus year history as a
beacon for bold and inventive work, we know the challenges and rewards of
producing and presenting alternative, groundbreaking theatre. In any given
year, there are over 500 independent theatre companies working for
opportunities to develop and present new work. We believe the best of this
community operates at the core of the contemporary theatre conversation (about
both content and form) and acts collectively to expand the boundaries of the
public imagination. With our move to Christopher Street, we aim to establish a
professional, high-profile platform for the independent theatre community,
reestablishing the West Village as a destination for mature, ridiculous,
engaged, irreverent, gut-wrenching, frivolous, sophisticated, foolish, and
profound theatrical endeavors. <span>The New Ohio was founded as Soho Think Tank, Inc., in 1994
by playwright/director Robert Lyons.</span></p>
<p><b><u>About
Performance Space 122</u></b><u><b></b></u></p>
<u>
</u><p><span>Performance Space 122 (PS122) provides incomparable experiences
for audiences by presenting and commissioning artists whose work challenges
boundaries of live performance. PS122 is dedicated to supporting the creative
risks taken by artists from diverse genres, cultures and perspectives. We are
an innovative local, national and international leader in contemporary
performance.</span></p>
<p>Beginning in 2011, PS122 embarked on one of the most unusual and
potentially radical shifts in its history, including a re-structuring of artist
support, a business model overhaul, and the renovation of our building. As
PS122’s East Village home undergoes a much-needed interior renovation supported
primarily by the City of New York, DCA and DDC, PS122’s core activity continues
to be providing audiences with contemporary live performance.</p>
<p>For over 3 decades, Performance Space 122 has been a hub for
contemporary performance and an active member of the cultural community. Under
the curatorial vision of Vallejo Gantner (Artistic Director 2005 – present)
PS122 has developed a set of programs designed to re-establish the value of
live performance, provide singular experiences for audiences that inspire critical

</div></div>","This Is the ThingI'm Mike Iveson. I'm trying to raise $15,000 to pay for my show, a show with words and music, called SORRY 
ROBOT - it just finished its run at the New Ohio Theatre, in New York City, to sold-out houses and nice reviews. We received a wonderful commission from Performance Space 122 to get it up and in front of people as part of their excellent COIL Festival. However, the thing has not even come close to paying for itself. It's like a teenager who refuses to get a job at this point and instead sits around at home playing video games, or maybe furiously knitting a cozy for something that doesn't need a cozy, like a futuristic telephone in a Keanu Reeves movie. You see where I'm going here.No, This Part Is Really the ThingThe play I wrote: SORRY ROBOT. 
It has eight songs in
it, and now, with the production's run behind us, we are hearing repeatedly that we need to make recordings of these songs available to our demanding and intensely sensory-deprived audience. More on this in a minute, but first, here is an example of a song in the play. It's called FEELINGS (EMOTIONAL FEELINGS). Why Though? No, Honestly, Why.PS122 has reached deep with this commission, part of their amazing Ethyl Eichelberger Award, and provided
funds that have allowed me to pay many astounding people - not super
generously, but adequately: performers Tanya Selvaratnam, Nicky Paraiso, and Anthony
R. Brown (standout luminaries all), the wonderful lighting designer Lucrecia
Briceno, the marvelous set and costume designer Parker Lutz, the incomparable
stage manager Maurina Lioce, and last but not least the incredible director, Will
Davis. But the commission can’t cover things like weeks of rehearsal space we needed to get this up and running, or
nominal fees for the many people who have stepped up to help out in rehearsal and
administratively, or the materials we used to make the visions of all these
hard-working brilliant thinkers come to life. Plus, like I said above, the songs. Many wonderful people got to see the show and hear the songs in it - and many wonderful people didn't, because of its short run and the intimate nature of the awesome New Ohio (around 80 seats). Getting us out of debt for the first run for the show can hopefully put us in the position where we can get a remount of the show on its feet. And as a thank-you to our crazy-generous supporters who can help us do that, we are going to provide everyone who contributes downloads of some of the final-night live recordings of some of SORRY ROBOT's songs. I'm going to reiterate this below, mostly to make sure that I actually did just write that. And Now, a Final Attempt at ClarityOkay, I'll say it again. A contribution of any amount gets you some downloads of a number of songs from the show -- ""Tears on the Treadmill"" and a couple others. Whew. Get it!In closing, here's some more words.This
 is my first full-length play. It builds on years of writing 
songs for performance art, dances, and plays, and of writing short plays and 
pieces of my own. It's pretty exciting to have to hold an audience's 
attention for a whole hour and a half. I feel like I've always been 
making singles and am now tackling a full LP. But not like a greatest 
hits, if we are going to ride this metaphor into the dirt. I think the 
songs in my show are great hits but as a whole it has the integrity of 
an LP, like, uh, Dusty in Memphis or Houses of the Holy. I would say OK 
Computer but I'm trying to distract your attention away from like 
technology ideas because my play is essentially about robots, and then 
you might start thinking about ""Mr. Roboto"" by Styx, and I encourage 
that but then someone's gonna say ""dad rock"" and then I'm going to have 
to emotionally abuse myself, for obvious reasons. So do me a flavor, watch the video which provides some visuals to accompany one of the songs you can hear in SORRY ROBOT – and then see where you're at.Your donations are tax-deductible to the extent provided by law.

About the
Ethyl Eichelberger Award
Since
1995, PS122 has given this commissioning award annually to an artist or group
that exemplifies Eichelberger’s larger-than-life style and generosity of
spirit; that embodies his multi-talented artistic virtuosity, bridging worlds
and inspiring those around them. Each winner receives an initial $5,000
commission to create a new work along with full production support when the
work premieres. Previous winners of the award include Justin Vivian Bond, Julie
Atlas Muz, Peggy Shaw, among many others. The Ethyl Eichelberger award is made
possible by the generosity of the Gesso Foundation. 
PS122 Artistic Director Vallejo Gantner commented
on Mike Iveson winning the 2013 award, “As an actor, writer, composer and
performance artist, Mike Iveson has been an essential collaborator with great
dance and theater artists. His generosity and goodwill is well known. My hope
is that the Ethyl Eichelberger Award will push Iveson to focus on his own
creative project. The award has a history of encouraging artists to commit to
their unique creative vision for the first time.”

About New
Ohio Theatre

New Ohio Theatre is a
two-time OBIE Award-winning performance venue that serves the vast independent
theatre community of New York and the adventurous audiences who love them. As a
small, downtown, artist-run organization with a twenty-plus year history as a
beacon for bold and inventive work, we know the challenges and rewards of
producing and presenting alternative, groundbreaking theatre. In any given
year, there are over 500 independent theatre companies working for
opportunities to develop and present new work. We believe the best of this
community operates at the core of the contemporary theatre conversation (about
both content and form) and acts collectively to expand the boundaries of the
public imagination. With our move to Christopher Street, we aim to establish a
professional, high-profile platform for the independent theatre community,
reestablishing the West Village as a destination for mature, ridiculous,
engaged, irreverent, gut-wrenching, frivolous, sophisticated, foolish, and
profound theatrical endeavors. The New Ohio was founded as Soho Think Tank, Inc., in 1994
by playwright/director Robert Lyons.

boundaries of live performance. PS122 is dedicated to supporting the creative
risks taken by artists from diverse genres, cultures and perspectives. We are
an innovative local, national and international leader in contemporary

primarily by the City of New York, DCA and DDC, PS122’s core activity continues
to be providing audiences with contemporary live performance.

contemporary performance and an active member of the cultural community. Under
the curatorial vision of Vallejo Gantner (Artistic Director 2005 – present)
PS122 has developed a set of programs designed to re-establish the value of
live performance, provide singular experiences for audiences that inspire critical
thinking, and sustain the creative process for artists throughout their career.

In this production, we will examine the relationship between self identity and the restraints of the constructed social system, the inherent duality of our natures as human beings, and the hilarity and severity of forbidden love. We will also explore the clown's relationship to the ethereal and Feste’s role as a Facilitator of change/chaos.</p><p>The construct of the space will be simple. 10 black theatre boxes which will be configured by the cast into varying shapes to create new environments, with highly stylized movement transitions and mask work, in addition to original music performed by the cast and composed by William Bednar. All actors will be onstage for the entirety of the run and will work diligently throughout to create the world and community of the play. Without the ease of exiting the space to change, and will the added challenge of actors playing multiple characters, our costume design will be integral to the success of our storytelling. Our costumes will be contemporary with influence of Edwardian shapes, designed by the ineffably talented Clare Parker.</p><p>All funds raised in ticket sales and concessions for this project will be put towards developing into an official non-profit organization with the goal of fully producing an original play created by one of our Lab members in addition to hosting multiple seminars, workshops and developmental labs in the next year.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Our Mission:</strong></h3><p>DUMB Theatre Co. is dedicated to developing work in a collaborative nature and providing leadership opportunities to women and under-represented groups. We strive to create resonant theatre which inspires reckless abandon, rebellion and courage in the face of adversity.

Lindsay Bednar-Carter, our company’s founder, was inspired to actualize this community and thus “The Lab” found it’s home in the Old American Can Factory on Sunday afternoons. After a year of developing new work through “The Lab”, it became apparent that our creators were in need of an in house production team. Thus DUMB Theatre Co. was born to fully realize the new works developed in “The Lab”, as well as to provide opportunities for artists with a passion for leadership to discover their voice. We are dedicated to facilitating a collaborative atmosphere and asking our artists to step outside the box to create the unseen, unheard, unsaid and unknown.</p><p> </p><h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558340353/pqthibojz2jip2abxtiq.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p><strong>We're well on our way:</strong> our theatre and rehearsal space rental and several other essential expenditures are already paid for through private investments and donations.</p><p><strong>With your help</strong> we will raise the majority of the funds we need to raise are for our 10 actor’s stipends. We have committed through AEA to pay a $350 stipend but we are hoping to raise this amount to $500 which doesn’t even truly begin to fairly compensate them for their time and effort. We are so thankful to our cast for volunteering their abilities in order to support our growth as a company.</p><p>In addition to raising their stipend from $350 to $500, this will require us to purchase Workers Comp insurance, in addition to Volunteer Accident coverage.

A rooftop in NY in the summer can be decorated nicely with a beverage or two, even if it’s just with some cold bubbly seltzer! The cost of alcoholic beverages for 99 people over 4 days would be about $1400.

To pay for their time and efforts.</p><p>We will need $682.50 for our crates used to construct our set. And a very small budget of $250 for our costume designer to use towards dry cleaning and the purchase of proper undergarments for the performance. $40 towards mask making supplies, and $50 towards the rental of weaponry.</p><p>We would also would like to have a very small budget of $450 to put towards camera rental, website fees, Facebook and Instagram advertisements as a part of our marketing campaign.</p><p><strong>If you did the math</strong>, you will see that if we got absolutely everything we wanted, we would need to raise more than $11,000.

We will also explore the clown's relationship to the ethereal and Feste’s role as a Facilitator of change/chaos.The construct of the space will be simple. 10 black theatre boxes which will be configured by the cast into varying shapes to create new environments, with highly stylized movement transitions and mask work, in addition to original music performed by the cast and composed by William Bednar. All actors will be onstage for the entirety of the run and will work diligently throughout to create the world and community of the play. Without the ease of exiting the space to change, and will the added challenge of actors playing multiple characters, our costume design will be integral to the success of our storytelling. Our costumes will be contemporary with influence of Edwardian shapes, designed by the ineffably talented Clare Parker.All funds raised in ticket sales and concessions for this project will be put towards developing into an official non-profit organization with the goal of fully producing an original play created by one of our Lab members in addition to hosting multiple seminars, workshops and developmental labs in the next year. Our Mission:DUMB Theatre Co. is dedicated to developing work in a collaborative nature and providing leadership opportunities to women and under-represented groups. We strive to create resonant theatre which inspires reckless abandon, rebellion and courage in the face of adversity. Through simplicity in production values, clear storytelling, and robust performances, we reimagine classical text and develop new works from fresh voices. Our Story:In 2017, Peter Hedges (What’s Eating Gilbert Grape; Dan in Real Life) envisioned a writer’s group where early career creators could gather, discuss, and share their work. Lindsay Bednar-Carter, our company’s founder, was inspired to actualize this community and thus “The Lab” found it’s home in the Old American Can Factory on Sunday afternoons. After a year of developing new work through “The Lab”, it became apparent that our creators were in need of an in house production team. Thus DUMB Theatre Co. was born to fully realize the new works developed in “The Lab”, as well as to provide opportunities for artists with a passion for leadership to discover their voice. We are dedicated to facilitating a collaborative atmosphere and asking our artists to step outside the box to create the unseen, unheard, unsaid and unknown. What We Need & What You GetWe're well on our way: our theatre and rehearsal space rental and several other essential expenditures are already paid for through private investments and donations.With your help we will raise the majority of the funds we need to raise are for our 10 actor’s stipends. We have committed through AEA to pay a $350 stipend but we are hoping to raise this amount to $500 which doesn’t even truly begin to fairly compensate them for their time and effort. We are so thankful to our cast for volunteering their abilities in order to support our growth as a company.In addition to raising their stipend from $350 to $500, this will require us to purchase Workers Comp insurance, in addition to Volunteer Accident coverage. Raising our budget by a quoted $2,300.We also would like to serve adult beverages at our event. A rooftop in NY in the summer can be decorated nicely with a beverage or two, even if it’s just with some cold bubbly seltzer! The cost of alcoholic beverages for 99 people over 4 days would be about $1400. But the insurance and license required with it are an additional quoted $2,500.We also would like afford our production team and designers a small stipend each all under $500. To pay for their time and efforts.We will need $682.50 for our crates used to construct our set. And a very small budget of $250 for our costume designer to use towards dry cleaning and the purchase of proper undergarments for the performance. $40 towards mask making supplies, and $50 towards the rental of weaponry.We would also would like to have a very small budget of $450 to put towards camera rental, website fees, Facebook and Instagram advertisements as a part of our marketing campaign.If you did the math, you will see that if we got absolutely everything we wanted, we would need to raise more than $11,000. So we hope you will please help us meet this goal and then some! REWARDS!We are offering a diverse selection of rewards in exchange for your early support.  ***Please note that you may need to double click on the reward square to see the full contents.Also, you'll be able to choose which night you'd like to attend at the end of this campaign, after you've purchased your tickets through the perk of your choice.***Not in New York?

<p>Despite appearances I really am just an average human being, I've failed against degenerative joint disease and have worked and studied hard to enjoy the different range and mechanics that the man-made arthroplasty has given me. This fine art dance film is a celebration of the conjunction of high performing athletics, science and medicine, at a time when hip surgery has become ubiquitous at younger ages like myself.</p> <ul> <li>Injuries and degeneration are to be expected among high performing athletes. The ominous fear of surgery becomes the psychological transition point for most athletic careers. I hope to relieve some of that traumatic burden with hope that if I can do it, perhaps you can look forward to a different condition after your own personal battle too. </li> <li>I am an engineer-artist. I have not gone into this blindly, with the guidance of my surgeon and professionals, I am exploring my limits and want to make this a technologically visual celebration. </li> <li>I have built sci-fi costumes for feature films, and I am midway through a detailed construction, I need funding to finish this. My exploration of movement has already gone beyond the known range of science that surgeons are used to seeing for this kind of surgery. All the ingredients are there, I just need your help to bring it together.</li> </ul>
<div>Before surgery, I always wanted to be ""better"" whatever that meant, but my biggest hurdle was after surgery, to let go and allow myself to be different. My joint cannot be compared to what it was before, and to do so puts me in a psychological bind I'm sure anyone who feels trapped in their bodies can relate to. Now I simply accept that ""progress"" is on all levels, mind, body and spirit.

I threw myself into ballet to overcome my daily challenges, and I now have followers that put their hope in me to show them ultimately what is possible in a new human condition.
Visual Concept:  A Cyber Ballet





I am not a professional dancer. By day I work full time and have an Engineering degree, by night I study the body with illustrations to make a come back from my joint disease. I did a final year dissertation years ago on stress transfer through a hip arthroplasty, 20 years later I did not anticipate becoming the subject of my own biomechanical study. I have come so far with my own personal financing, but you can make it a dream come true for others. Your contribution not only helps me pay towards the professional artists and stunt people who are working with me, but bring the dance film to a stunning hyper-reality which will show young athletes what they can be capable of.  I am not under any illusion that I can match the standards of a professional ballet dancer, but I have pushed myself to work with what I've got and enjoy what I have. I hope this can pave the way to show aspiring young athletes to find new ways to work with their bodies.
   What We Need & What You Get

I have so far paid for private tuition, begged and borrowed equipment and stages for testing, laboured long into the nights constructing bionic suits, but I can't finish without your help. I'm feeling pretty drained and there's still things I need to pay for.
I have 3 tiers of goals. The 1st is simply to pay for what I already owe for choreography and training. The 2nd is to shoot this as cleanly as possible with minimal crew on location. The ultimate goal of 60k would see my dream come true to hire the stage and production I need, and take my story to film festivals.


  I want to reimburse every artist for working with me, I have come so far paying out of my own pocket, but we could go so much farther. If this campaign is minimally funded, we will shoot as cleanly as possible on location. If we exceed our initial goal, I will be able to hire a visually stunning stage to go with the stunning costumes I'm building. If I don't reach my goal, the funding received will simply reimburse many of the artists who have spent their time working with me on private coaching, as well as pay for much of the materials and electronics I still have extended on credit card.
Our perks are to allow you to collaborate with us and amplify our voice. By donating to this project we will share and shoutout your message to our audience across various channels of 25-30k followers. We can offer online ballet lessons and online social media consultancy.
I also have secret perks for industry level sponsors and partners who wish to either show their philanthropic support in exchange for licensing of the dance film, brand awareness, or in exchange for a specially customised piece of wall art. 


Improving the Human Condition


Despite appearances I really am just an average human being, I've failed against degenerative joint disease and have worked and studied hard to enjoy the different range and mechanics that the man-made arthroplasty has given me. This fine art dance film is a celebration of the conjunction of high performing athletics, science and medicine, at a time when hip surgery has become ubiquitous at younger ages like myself.  Injuries and degeneration are to be expected among high performing athletes. The ominous fear of surgery becomes the psychological transition point for most athletic careers. I hope to relieve some of that traumatic burden with hope that if I can do it, perhaps you can look forward to a different condition after your own personal battle too.  I am an engineer-artist. I have not gone into this blindly, with the guidance of my surgeon and professionals, I am exploring my limits and want to make this a technologically visual celebration.  I have built sci-fi costumes for feature films, and I am midway through a detailed construction, I need funding to finish this. My exploration of movement has already gone beyond the known range of science that surgeons are used to seeing for this kind of surgery. All the ingredients are there, I just need your help to bring it together. 
Before surgery, I always wanted to be ""better"" whatever that meant, but my biggest hurdle was after surgery, to let go and allow myself to be different. My joint cannot be compared to what it was before, and to do so puts me in a psychological bind I'm sure anyone who feels trapped in their bodies can relate to. Now I simply accept that ""progress"" is on all levels, mind, body and spirit. My spirit was never taken down by the hip joint disease, instead I am entirely grateful that modern science and medicine filled in the gap that I studied 20 years ago on arthroplasties.

About Gross Domestic Product

    When a trailblazing senator holds a public forum to unveil her new economic agenda for mothers in America, she is slapped with realities that are far more harsh than she could have imagined.

<h3><strong>Story?</strong></h3>
<p>This campaign is important to us not only to fund and bring an important piece of theatre to an audience but also to highlight the struggles that people with additional needs face in a world where perfection is worshiped and tabloid media are ruthless in their pursuit of a headline.</p>
<p>We are passionate about sharing the talent of our creative team from both sides of the border. New and emerging talent will work hand in hand to bring Quicksand from the page to the stage, with the support of this campaign.</p>
<p>This campaign gives our subscribers an active role in the making of Quicksand. As an unfunded company we want to reward you for your support and passion. Your generosity here will give you a more interactive experience in the lead up to and beyond the performance.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>While we can't wait to share Quicksand in the intimacy that The New Theatre offers, we also cannot expect the team to be able to thrill and shock you while working for free. Our next biggest costs are venue rental and insurance. And then we have things like a set, some costumes and some theatre magic to draw you into the warped world of Joy &amp; Joe. All in all our target of €5,000 is just a little over half of the overall cost of production.  </p>
<p>We will draw you into the world of Joe and Joy with our unique rewards. Get your own tabloid cover complete with headline. Meet the cast and crew and have your own VIP experience when you come to see the show. </p>
<p>We will supplement our fundraising with pop-up opportunities in the next few weeks but with none of the rewards?! Why wait?? </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Otherness and Isolation are something that all human beings have experienced. A woman who has raised her additional needs son (himself locked-in through his challenges) with a lack of support from services, friends and family is all too familiar. Quicksand pushes back the boundaries of theatre in the style in which it is staged and the themes which speak to an audience beyond our shores.</p>
<p>You can be a part of bringing this piece of work to the world and in doing so maybe open up or change your way of thinking.</p>
<h3><strong>Who are we?</strong></h3>
<p>Both the writer Elizabeth Moynihan and the producer Idír Mná have a history that puts diversity and inclusion at the heart of their work. Never more so in the case of Quicksand. Elizabeth Moynihan has won several awards and has a proven track record for her work for LGBTQ+ and also for her award winning radio series Cider Queens which explored the theme of addiction. </p>
<p>Idir Mná has had sell out runs of an all female(ish) 'Glengarry Glen Ross' by David Mamet, 'Airswimming' by Charlotte Jones, as well as producing staged readings at The Attic Studio and The New Theatre. Yvonne was one of the producers behind 'The Big Green Apple', a transatlantic collaboration between the Attic Studio in Dublin and the 1st  Irish Festival in New York.</p>
<p><strong>Meet the rest of the team:</strong></p>
<p>EMILY FORAN is our extraordinary directer. She currently works in both Belfast and Dublin. She trained at The Lir Academy, Dublin and is a graduate of Queen's University Belfast. Her recent credits include: Extremities at The New Theatre; Fake I.D. at the MAC Belfast; SHARKTANK at Stockholm Fringe Festival (Winner of the Audience Choie Award); We Like It Here at The Lyric and After The End at The Lyric and The New Theatre. </p>
<p>REX RYAN trained at The Gaiety Schoool of Acting. He recently performed on the Peacock stage at The Abbey in Philip Ridley's Tonight With Donny Stixx directed by Karl Shiels. Rex is Artistic Director of Glass Mask Theatre Company; the Resident company of Smock Alley Theatre Dublin, 2018/2019. Rex recently performed in a critically acclaimed debut production for Glass Mask; Idlewild - A gangland tragedy by Associate playwright Jimmy Murphy. </p>
<p>DONNA DENT trained at the Brendan Smith Academy and the College of Music. With more than 40 theatre credits in Ireland's biggest shows, we can't possibly mention them all here. Like seriously - Miss Havesham in GREAT EXPECTATIONS and Sally Brass in THE OLD CURIOSITY SHOP! Not to mention (<i>but I'm totally gonna</i>) ALL MY SONS, ARCADIA, UNCLE VANYA, A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE, LEAR, OTHELLO, A DOLLS HOUSE - the list goes on. Donna is excited to be returning to theatre after a 5 year hiatus. We are so incredibly lucky to have her.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help: We would ask you  to get the word out about Quicksand on your social media platforms and make  as much noise as you can about our campaign.  And may we remind you to use the Indiegogo share tools! We would be so very grateful to you for that as it gets the word out to many more people that may be able to help make QUICKSAND  happen. Le Grá, Idír Mná and the Quicksand company.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Roger Mathey and I have been doing theatre for nearly 30 years, running a small non-profit company called seat of your pants Productions. I was made aware of this one woman show a number of years ago and have wanted to stage it ever since. </p>
<p>This show is about a young woman from Washington State who goes to the Middle East to find out how she can help in the Palestinian/Israeli conflict. Having grown up in the Middle East, I found Rachel's story hit me in many ways.</p>
<p>Rachel's story, developed by actor Alan Rickman from her writings, journals, e-mails, and letters home, is the true story of a young woman who went to Israel to see first hand of things she had only heard of and in her journey she is killed trying to defend people from what she saw as an injustice.</p>
<p>What we are hoping to do by telling her story is open more dialogue about the conflict and enlighten people to the situation from a first hand view.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As a non-profit, we survive based on donations. Independent theatre is a dying art, but we feel it is an important medium and one that truly expresses emotions that people can feel.</p>
<p>We are hoping to raise $5000 here (along with funding from other sources) in order to pay for things such as the theater space (an expensive commodity in San Francisco), the talent (our actor, crew, designers), publicity (posters, postcards, etc), and all the things that go into making a play such as lighting, set materials, costuming, and make up.</p>
<p>We have several perks to offer including original signed artwork, free tickets, and free drinks and food! Check out our perks.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are hoping to open audiences' minds to what is going on in the Middle East. We are not looking to argue or take a side, but desire to make people think. Theatre is such a powerful venue for that and we are performing this show in an intimate space (with only 25 seats), so the audience can really feel the energy coming from the stage.</p>
<p>We have staged a number of productions over the years with the intent of provoking thought, so that when the people leave the theater, they continue to think about the subject matter see what they can do to help.</p>
<p>This show tackles a very sensitive subject in this day and age. We are not looking to point blame. Rachel became an activist to help people she thought were in need of it and for that she paid the ultimate price.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As we have said, independent theatre is a dying art form. But we also know it's a vital one.Share what qualifies you to overcome these hurdles. It does not have the explosions and special effects of movies or the glitz and glamour of Broadway, but it does have an intimacy like no other art form.</p>
<p>We are looking to rent a 25 seat space (not only because it's more affordable for us) to make the one woman show even more intimate. The audience will see, feel, and experience Rachel's journey through her words. They will be so close as to experience it for themselves. This is what theatre is to us. Personal storytelling that people can experience on a deeper level</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We realize these are tough times for people and that not everyone can contribute financially. If you can't, please share the link to your other social media platforms or e-mail to people you know who may be able to and have a desire to support the arts and this show.</p>
<p>Indiegogo has a number of share tools that people can use to spread the word.</p>

<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>The Torch Sisters are a group of 10 women that are passionate about sharing circus arts with the community. We began approximately 8 years ago as a group of friends hooping at bars, who created a demand in the community. With time we have added additional flow props as well as aerial arts and acrobatics to our performances. We went from payment in beer to our own solo show in the brand new Jamf theater of the Pablo Center. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What can we do for you?</h3>
<p>In order to perform at high-level events, we need to carry performer's insurance for each member of the troupe. This insurance covers the audience and the performance space for any unforeseen events that could occur. This will cost our troupe $3,000 annually.</p>
<p>When you contribute to our campaign, you will receive perks that have never been previously offered by Torch Sisters, ranging from merchandise to semi-private classes taught by members of the troupe. You will be the first people to receive merchandise with our brand new logo.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Torch Sisters are a unique group in the region, that has only grown since its inception. In the past year requests for performances have increased exponentially, leading to the culmination of a solo show. The shows are requiring more professionalism while drawing larger audiences. We plan to continue to expand our repertoire to continue to bring new talents and surprises to our community.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What if we can't achieve our goal?</h3>
<p>If we are unable to raise the funds for insurance, the cost will negatively impact our member's abilities to perform. We need our whole troupe performing to carry on the best shows possible without leaving members with a costly financial burden.</p>

<h3>Project Description &amp; History</h3>
<p>My name is Michael Gorman. I'm a playwright, installation artist, and the founder and director of <a href=""http://www.fortyhourclub.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Forty Hour Club</a>—a resident company of La MaMa Theatre in NYC where I am currently the Playwright in Residence.  My plays and the work of the Forty Hour Club focus on the economic, environmental and systemic destruction facing working communities and the paramount issue of sustainability.</p>
<p>For the past two decades I have been writing and producing plays about the opiate epidemic—most often financed out of my own pocket and through the generosity and deep commitment of a group of artists and friends dedicated to shedding light on this issue.  I am amazed by what The Forty Hour Club has been able to accomplish.  It is a true testament to the power of community and what can be achieved despite a lack of mainstream institutional support. The time has come, however, to ask for help and the support of a larger community.</p>
<p>We are in danger of losing a whole generation of young people to the plague of opiate addiction, and we desperately need a more “creative” approach with which to attack this epic foe.  It is my belief that with your support, “Chasing The New White Whale” and its innovative art &amp; advocacy model has the potential to not only change perceptions about addiction but to also save lives.</p>
<p>I have my own connection to the opiate epidemic: my brother, a commercial fisherman, lost his life to a heroin overdose in 1998—a tragic event that effected me deeply and inspired me to embark on the creative journey that has culminated in this project.  But CTNWW is not simply about personal sadness and loss; it is about a regional and national health crisis and an artistic call to action.  It is not intended to be my plaintive voice but the echo of the over 70,000 lives lost to opiate addiction each year.  </p>

<h3>Your Contribution &amp; Impact</h3>
<p>By helping to support this project, you will be giving voice to all those caught up in the storm of addiction and whose stories I have been inspired by in creating and producing “Chasing The New White Whale”— fishermen, recovering addicts, family members, law enforcement, health practitioners, politicians, economists, journalists, spiritual leaders, artists and the ghosts of those who have passed.  To make visible the invisible.</p>
<p>Theatre has the power to heal; to create constructive dialogue; to reduce the stigma and shame around addiction; and to help to change the perception of addicts in our community.  I have likened the effort needed in confronting addiction to that of Ahab and the sailors aboard the Pequod in confronting the White Whale: it requires all hands on deck.  I hope you will join me in this challenging but deeply rewarding pursuit.  </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need funds to help us cover the large expenses associated with producing our productions and bringing them to working communities throughout New England that are hardest by the opioid epidemic.</p>
<p>Theatrical productions are expensive to produce: Our production company—The Forty Hour Club— recently produced ""Chasing The New White Whale"" in New York City at The Ellen Stewart Theatre at La MaMa for a total cost of $24,000 for a 3-week run. Ticket sales (which we split with the theatre) made up a very small percentage of that (10%).  Like many times before, I paid for the cost of this production out of my own pocket—even going so far as to refinance my home and take out substantial loans. However, this is not sustainable, and we are looking at alternate ways in which we can carry out our mission and fund our work in the future—including grants, donations, and other forms of creative financing.  </p>
<p>Funds donated to this campaign will also enable us to launch—""Chasing The New White Whale""—our art &amp; advocacy project, and begin regional and National outreach efforts—including upcoming programs and performances on the Maine island communities of North Haven &amp; Vinalhaven. </p>
<p>Future goals for the project include touring ""Chasing The New White Whale""  to venues and working waterfront communities across the country most hard hit by the opiate epidemic.  Our next planned production will take place in historic New Bedford, MA— a fishing port at the center of the epidemic.  Your donation to this project will help us get there.  Funds will go directly to help pay for the costs associated with producing a successful event, including: hiring actors; renting performance spaces and equipment; lodging and transportation; outreach; administration; and more.</p>

Over the course of the 2 hour production, the audience will be invited to explore the house, where all stories intertwine with the life of Lorca himself, primarily through movement, dance, music, improv and minimal dialogue. One story, leading up to a wedding, the other in the aftermath of a funeral, as the playwright looks on, unable to save his characters and ultimately unable to save himself.<br/><br/>Experientially, the audience will be free to discover characters going through both the dramatic, and mundane, parts of their evenings within the house. The exquisite interior of The Montauk Club will act as the set for the production, playing as much a role as the actors.</p><p>This will be the first stage of development and our contributors will get to witness first hand the ""behind the scenes"" creation into the the developed production.  With your help we will continue to grow this story and shape the characters and event, so that it may travel and be presented both locally and eventually on a national level, utilizing special and unique spaces to partner and present with.</p><p>Our perks include the obvious, which is the opportunity to experience The House first hand, but also listen to the lilting sounds of Lorca’s poetry read in Spanish, various lessons with our artists, advance purchasing opportunities and discount codes, keepsakes and one - on -one personalized experiences, and so much more.</p><p><i><strong>We invite you to join us in laying the foundation and starting bricks of “The House”!</strong></i><br/><strong>We can not embark on this spectacle and creation without your support!</strong></p><p><strong>Quite Simply, We need your help!</strong></p><p><u><strong>What we have in place:</strong></u></p><ul>

Over the course of the 2 hour production, the audience will be invited to explore the house, where all stories intertwine with the life of Lorca himself, primarily through movement, dance, music, improv and minimal dialogue. One story, leading up to a wedding, the other in the aftermath of a funeral, as the playwright looks on, unable to save his characters and ultimately unable to save himself.Experientially, the audience will be free to discover characters going through both the dramatic, and mundane, parts of their evenings within the house. The exquisite interior of The Montauk Club will act as the set for the production, playing as much a role as the actors.This will be the first stage of development and our contributors will get to witness first hand the ""behind the scenes"" creation into the the developed production.  With your help we will continue to grow this story and shape the characters and event, so that it may travel and be presented both locally and eventually on a national level, utilizing special and unique spaces to partner and present with.Our perks include the obvious, which is the opportunity to experience The House first hand, but also listen to the lilting sounds of Lorca’s poetry read in Spanish, various lessons with our artists, advance purchasing opportunities and discount codes, keepsakes and one - on -one personalized experiences, and so much more.We invite you to join us in laying the foundation and starting bricks of “The House”!We can not embark on this spectacle and creation without your support!Quite Simply, We need your help!What we have in place:

Support and rights from the Lorca Estate
An Exciting Choreography & Movement Team

<h3>In The Heart of the Wasp's Nest</h3>
<p>Frank and Norman are well at home in their castle as the technicians of a Fashion College. When new recruit Carol makes an allegation of sexual misconduct, the team are thrown into chaos, where difficult questions are asked, and allegiances are tested. Slapstick and tragedy combine in this unflinching, hilarious, in-your-face Liverpool comedy.</p>
<p>For this new play, theatre-makers Karl Falconer and Natasha Ryan have pulled together interest from some of the UK theatre industry's biggest players to showcase new talent and champion new working-class voices on stage and off. We're small on resources but big on ambition, and after 10 years of hard toil, exposure is finally coming our way. We have a strong script, a ridiculously talented cast and some of the UK's top up-and-coming crew, so now we need some resources to put our best work in front of the biggest audience. Your support will make that happen.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521570163/tlytnljod93d1p2c5zbz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>The Target. </h3>
<p>Money raised through this avenue of support will go towards production costs including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set design and scenic construction</li>
<li>Van Hire and Set Storage</li>
<li>Prop Design and development</li>
<li>Costume design and creation</li>
<li>Sound Design</li>
<li>Printing, Advertising and Promotion</li>
</ul>
<p>Alongside this, we have secured significant in-kind support for rehearsal space, technical equipment and some basic elements of design. We want to use the resources we have to go a long way, and we have a fantastic crew with dedicated specialist experience in producing and designing for low-budget theatre. We will be able to use these funds to produce something far beyond its budget limitations.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What's It All For?</h3>
<p>We've been producing theatre for a long time but this project is unique.</p>
<p>The tide is changing on the unfair arts world, and about time too. Movements such as #MeToo and the Diversity School initiative are sparking fierce debate about who can access opportunities and what power means. But we don't want to talk. In the spirit of 2018 being the year of Deeds Not Words, it's time to make a statement. This is how we're doing it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking our work to England's biggest arts festival as well as on tour; we want to take our message to the widest audience we can</li>
<li>Being dedicated to supporting an all-female crew</li>
<li>Sharing our work with top-theatre critic Lyn Gardner and the Young Vic's Director's Network</li>
<li>Supporting and championing a working-class, Northern cast and crew who might not have the opportunity for exposure that this project could provide</li>
<li>Putting new voices on the stage and using this as a way to get new audiences involved in theatre</li>
<li>Discussing the potential to stream our work with Digital Theatre+</li>
</ul>
<p>We have secured the support of <i>Happy Valley</i> and <i>Cucumber</i> star, Con O'Neill, and have already had interest from HOME, the Lowry, the Oldham Coliseum, Theatre 503, the Young Vic and SlungLow in coming to see the production with a view to further collaborations. We have secured a central London venue and we're delivering on our promise to get this show in front of the right people. Our list of supporters is growing by the day, but now we need to make sure that the show we put in front of them is the best it can be. This will give our talent the best chance to shine, and give this important story its best chance of future success.</p>

<h3>Can We Do It?</h3>
<p>In a word, Yes. We have 10 years of producing theatre, and of helping others to achieve something special. We've built our company up, year on year, to be hailed as '<i>one of the UK's fastest rising ensembles</i>' and we've done it all from our own hard graft. No startup funds, no helping hand. We know how to produce theatre, we just need the resources to achieve it.</p>
<p>Because of our experience, we understand the pitfalls, and most of these come from lack of planning. We have prepared ourselves for contingency and started the ball rolling early to ensure proper planning. We're really blessed to have pulled together a fantastic cast and crew with extensive experience, who are going to add to our own expertise to ensure this project is a success.</p>
<p>We're used to working with limited resources, and even if we don't reach our full target, any finance will make a significant contribution to enabling us to showcase the production and our talent as best as we can.</p>

<h3>It's Not Just About Money</h3>
<p>Hey, we get it. And we know that everyone says that 'every little helps'. But here's the thing. There's a lot of 'new' theatre and with a 'new' play our greatest asset is word of mouth. We believe this is a project worth shouting about, with a cast and crew who deserve to have their work seen. If you're inspired by our ethos and want to help, here's how you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tweet and shout and let it all out - the more people who know about the crowdfunder and the project, the further we can take our message</li>
<li>Do the fangirl thing - a show ain't much without an audience, and we're going to need one if the show is going to be a success. Come catch us on tour!</li>
<li>Take the bins out - hey we'll take your bins out for you. Our set needs a lot of props, decoration and clutter, so if you've been waiting 15 years to throw out that Windows 95 desktop or trade that sandwich maker, let us take it off your hands. Genuinely.</li>

<h3>The Show</h3>
<p>A Trilogy of Horrors is a collection of three classic tales, updated and adapted into a chilling storytelling set. It features:</p>
<p><strong>Charles Dickens' <i>The Signal Man</i></strong><br/>A schoolmistress tells of an unnerving meeting with a railway signalman, who claims to be visited by a prophetic ghost.</p>
<p><strong>Mary Shelley's <i>The Mortal Immortal</i></strong><br/>Follow a man's tale of his youth working as an apprentice to an alchemist trying to<br/>create the elixir of life.</p>
<p><strong>Edgar Allen Poe's<i> The Tell-Tale Heart</i></strong><br/>A chilling account of a woman’s descent into paranoid madness, which<br/>drives her down into the darkest parts of the human soul.</p>
<p>Described as 'masters of storytelling' by the Wee Review, we're incredibly proud of this set which has previously been performed at The Bread &amp; Roses, The White Bear, and the Horniman Museum. This is our chance to take it up to new audiences, in a venue well known for it's storytelling reputation.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Theatre is, unfortunately, expensive to produce, especially during the Fringe. We've managed to reduce our costs due to a great venue, but we've still got expenses to cover. We'll be taking the show up either way, but any help you can provide will make it that bit easier for us.</p>
<p>We've set our goal at the minimum IndieGogo let us (£500), but we're using flexible funding so if we don't hit that, we can still do wonders with whatever lovely donations we do get! Any money received will go on:</p>
<p>- The big expense: Edinburgh Fringe Registration Fee (£300)<br/>- Marketing materials<br/>- Upfront assistance for travel + accommodation for cast and crew*</p>
<p>*Providing assistance here allows us to support performers and crew members who may otherwise be at a financial disadvantage and unable to participate. We're constantly working on being more inclusive, more diverse and more accessible, so this would be a great help!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With a (hopefully!) successful ten day run at the Fringe under our belts, we'll have more clout to do even more things. We've got more upcoming projects in the works - including another, different, set of monologues happening at the Camden Fringe - and the better we do with this show, the more we can pour back into future shows. What does this mean?</p>
<p>- More new writing and support of new writers<br/>- More assistance available for people working with us<br/>- More shows!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Are there risks and challenges? Definitely, as there are with any theatre production. However, the important thing to note is that this project will be going ahead regardless of money raised - we're all funding out of pocket to make this happen. Your help is exactly that - help, rather than the sole source of funding! This means that we won't end up in a position where the show doesn't go ahead.</p>
<p>In terms of getting the perks out, we've spoken with other groups who've ran similar campaigns in order to get advice, and have kept it simple. One non-physical perk means that the fulfilment doesn't require postage costs, and the other one is designed to keep those postage costs as low as possible. This means the cost to us (and you) is minimal for these, and instead, the money can be channelled into where we need it - the show itself.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>In 2015, I produced my original musical <i>The Katrina Roadhouse, </i>set in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. It was a fundraiser for the New Orleans organization Common Ground Relief. The performances sold out in two weeks. This was also a successful Indiegogo campaign. Since then, I've had two short plays produced in New England: <i>Wrong Place, Right Time and Getting Old is Getting Old.  </i>I've been a musician  in local bands for the past 40 years and  one of my bands won 4 consecutive Boston Music Awards .  I've written over 50 songs  and recorded 11  CD's during my career. I am about to launch  this major production<i> I'd Rather Be Lucky Than Good  </i>which contains 10 of my originals. I've been working on the script, the music, and the lyrics for the past five years.</p>
<p>This campaign means a great deal to me. I've put in hundreds of hours in preparation to make this musical an event that provides for the audience: entertainment, humor, and some thought provoking questions about golf, fate, and friendship. I'm very pleased that the noted Boston area director, Haris Lefteri, will direct our fantastic cast: Arthur Williams III, Ken Brassard, Michael Joseph Reardon, Sonya Joyner, Adjovi Koene, Alanna Lynch, and Larry Segel. The Squeezebox Stompers Trio which includes, Larry Plit, Geoff Wadsworth, and myself will provide musical accompaniment for the actors as they sing and dance.</p>
<p>I've enlisted two Suffolk University interns, Donovan Skepple and Dan Silvia to provide technical support in photography and marketing. The table is set; however, we can use financial assistance for the extensive costs involved in producing a musical:</p>
<ul>
<li>stipends for the cast, crew, and band</li>
<li>rehearsal and performance venue fees</li>
<li>props and set design</li>
<li>advertising</li>
<li>costumes</li>
<li>recording  of the accompanying CD</li>
<li>costs of the perks: postcards, hats, T-shirts, CD's, and scripts</li>
<li>numerous miscellaneous costs</li>
</ul>
<p>By contributing to this campaign, you can help us make this production an outstanding and memorable event.  As far as I know, no one else has written a musical about golf and the characters who frequent this sport. You can play a major role in this play by providing some financial backing that can help us meet the initial start up costs. This will carry us through to the performances where we'll get additional money from the ticket sales to meet all of our expenses. The show  will go on no matter how much we receive from this kick-starter campaign.  We're dedicated to making this play come alive!</p>
<p>For our contributors, we have some limited edition perks available : postcards, hats, T-shirts, CD's, scripts and listing in the playbill as a donor.  You can come to  a performance of the play , wear your T-shirts and hats, and join in the fun. We ask that you also support us by sharing this Indiegogo.com website with your friends.  Please spread the word on your social media sites as well.  Together we can make this production a memorable ""hole-in-one.""</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Emerging stage director, Dan Smith has always been fascinated by the theatrical nature of Carlo Collodi's ""The Adventures of Pinocchio"", and has wanted to write an original adaptation that focuses on the more humorous and grotesque elements of the story. In spring 2016, Smith began writing his own adaptation that both celebrated and critiqued Collodi's story through the lens of a young adult/college student.</p>
<p>Smith approached emerging film director, Riley Bartolomeo about the possibility of hopping onboard as co-director to infuse the project with cinematic elements such as projections and multimedia. Bartolomeo joined the project as co-director, and the two began to dig into Smith's script while asking such questions as:</p>
<p>- Should you NEVER lie? </p>
<p>- Does the truth hurt?</p>
<p>- Can kindness kill you?</p>
<p>- Why am I here?</p>
<p>- Why should I wake up tomorrow?</p>
<p>- Is death the end all, be all?</p>
<p>- Why should I care about YOU?</p>
<p>- Why should YOU care about ME?</p>
<p>Over the past month, Smith &amp; Bartolomeo have been working with an ensemble of actors to workshop the piece, with the goal of beginning rehearsals for the summer production in March. The project is slated to be performed in July 2018, for a limited weekend engagement. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Through our fundraising efforts, we have already covered more than half the costs of a deposit for the space, pre-production expenses, and rehearsal expenses. However, we still need to cover the costs of:</p>
<p>- Space Use (Performance &amp; Rehearsal)</p>
<p>- Costumes, Props, Sets, etc.</p>
<p>- Paid Labor (Carpenters and Designers)</p>
<p>- Compensating All Parties Involved</p>
<p>With your help, we can produce family friendly theatre for a NYC audience in Summer 2018! All proceeds will go towards production costs, and will ensure that we can provide quality theatre for families at a low rate. </p>
<p>QUICK FACTS:</p>
<p>- Theatre 54 is a 60-seat house that would be utilized for a weekend/six-performance run</p>
<p>- Ticket prices will ideally be between $15-20, depending on costs</p>
<p>- All creatives, actors, and production team members will be college aged artists/professionals</p>

<h3>In short...</h3>
<p>I, Janelle Hacault, am a professional contemporary dancer/choreographer who recently moved from Winnipeg (hi PegCity family) to Montréal to further develop my passion for dance. Upon meeting these extraordinary humans (the dancers you see in the video), I was quickly convinced we needed to create together in a positive and open environment.</p>
<p>The result is ""Shapeshifters"", a dance piece about the many sides of one woman's inner self that collide, confuse and eventually co-exist.  It's quirky and endearing with a touch of crazy. It is my creative baby, first group work, and the first time I'm presenting my choreography in Montréal thanks to Festival Quartiers Danses... and it's NOT done.</p>
<p>We have to finish creating the piece by Sept. 11th in order to put it on stage. We need to pay for costumes, lighting design, music composition (did someone mention a harp player is in the show?), and artist fees.</p>
<p>Once the dance is done, national and international presenters will see the show and potentially offer us more performance opportunities. This campaign is to help launch the work and allow my baby to live!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>To date, approximately 60 hours of research and rehearsal have been invested voluntarily into this project. By September 12th, this number will increase to a total of 400 hours collectively. The $3,000 of contributions will help go towards the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finishing the creation process</li>
<li>Rental space</li>
<li>Artistic fees</li>
<li>Costumes</li>
<li>Music composition</li>
<li>Lighting design</li>
</ul>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>It takes a tribe to create a dance baby and to thank you for supporting us, we want to give back. Here are some of the perks to look forward to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personalized email from yours truly</li>
<li>Social media shout-out for all to read</li>
<li>Handwritten postcard addressed to you</li>
<li>Invitation to a rehearsal</li>
<li>1 minute dance clips sent to you every day for a week!</li>
<li>Tickets to the premiere of the show</li>
<li>Dinner with the cast, cooked by me</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Due to the high competition for government funding and the continual decrease of public support for the arts, all too often artists have to juggle 2 full-time careers in order to create work out of their passion. As George Bernard Shaw puts it, ""Without art, the crudeness of reality would make the world unbearable."" Help us change this.</p>
<p>In the past, I have raised over $5000 for projects put on by Nova Dance Collective, touring for .6 Ricochet and more recently, a collaborative work called ""Falling"" that toured to Toronto and Winnipeg. Rest assured, your contributions are in good hands going to good people!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I get it, we all go through seasons where giving monetarily is not viable. It's ok! We value any help we can get. So please, consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting the word out by posting on your preferred social media platform. Make a buzz!</li>
<li>Sharing by word of mouth with friends and family</li>
<li>Asking your workplace if they would consider sponsoring us</li>
<li>Comment and like the posts I share on social media about the project</li>

<p>(l-r) Indiia Wilmott, Aejay Mitchell, Aaron Wilton, Kehinde Koyejo, Rotimi Agbabiaka</p>
<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>We are an award-winning, multi-ethnic, multi-generational and multi-faceted theatre company focused on Black theater and performance.  We seek to perform work that offers an expanded idea of Black theater in content, form, look and presentation. We find it necessary to work within artistic processes that do not reinforce the dominant paradigm and current power structures.  We are inspired by inclusivity and plurality of thought; the black avant-garde, and work that immediately challenges our most entrenched assumptions.</p>
<p>Currently, we are an ensemble of seven core members: Rotimi Agbabiaka, Edris Cooper-Anifowoshe (co-founder), Kehinde Koyejo, AeJay Mitchell, Shirley Smallwood (co-founder), Indiia Wilmott and Aaron Wilton.  We are in residence at Brava! for Women in the Arts, a community non-profit in San Francisco's MIssion District.  At Brava, we have premiered three plays by Black playwrights - <u>In A Daughter's Eyes</u> by A. Zell Williams; <u>Sweet Maladies</u> by Zakiyyah Alexander and last season's Bootycandy by Robert O'Hara. </p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516008709/k7hzilu92sdyc6x2sil3.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<ul>
<li>We are San Francisco's only theater dedicated to new work and the black avant garde.</li>
<li>We have presented more than 10 new works by Black playwrights to San Francisco audiences - plays by Keith Josef Adkins, Robert Alexander, Pearl Cleage and Robert O'Hara and numerous staged readings of new plays.</li>
<li>We have received critical acclaim for all of our productions and formal recognition from Theater Bay Area Awards , in 2014 - Outstanding Ensemble for <u>Sweet Maladies</u> &amp; 2017 - Acting nominations for <u>Bootycandy</u>. </li>
<li>We are prepared to respond to the moment!  We participated in the New Black Fest national play event, <u>Facing Our Truth</u>, seven short plays by seven playwrights surrounding the murder of Trayvon Martin. </li>
<li>Our So Soul San Francisco salons are part of a larger effort at documenting the Black performance history of San Francisco and the Bay Area. </li>
<li>We are all separate and successful artists who have committed ourselves to building a company together -<strong> </strong>taking charge of our careers and taking responsibility for what's on stage.</li>
<li>This work is fiercely important and fills a myriad of voids, builds a bucketload of bridges, smashes seas of stereotypes and provokes a plethora of potent pontifications.</li>

<h3>Project #1 - So Soul San Francisco: Black Art Salons</h3>
<p>In  2018, we are curating a series of monthly Black Art Salons, on third Thursdays in Brava's new cabaret space.  We kick it all off on February 1 with Black Heaven: A Spiritual House Party.</p>
<p>  The first six salons are -</p>
<ul>
<li>February 15 - Oju Ibeji features the work of  <strong>Melorra Green</strong> and <strong>Melonie Green</strong> who will offer ways to look and participate art that we guarantee you have not experienced.</li>
<li>March 15  -  Afro Present: Dreamtime in the endless twilight of 24/7 features the work of dancer/choreographer, <strong>Amara Tabor Smith </strong>and the legendary <strong>Ellen Sebastian Chang</strong> </li>
<li>April 19  - Black Benatar's Black Magic Cabaret  with guest host,<strong> Beatrice Thomas</strong> (aka Black Benatar) </li>
<li>May 17 - Black on Black: High Crimes and Misdemeanors, hosted by BACCE</li>
<li>June 21 - Black Music Salon featuring local musicians</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We are seeking funding to pay salon artists and offer adequate technical support for each salon</strong>.</p>
<h3>Project #2 - Robert O'Hara's An American Ma(u)l</h3>
<p>A dsytopian comedy that is a bit too close to home right now.  A newly elected,rogue president jump starts a failing economy by reviving domestic slavery.  Mayhem ensues as neighbors - a black family and a white family, fight for a new normal.</p>
<p>Robert O'Hara, author of  <u>Bootycandy</u> and<u> Barbecue,</u> is in fine satiric form with the timely script.  We can't wait to bring this to the stage!</p>
<p>We are committed to paying  a decent wage to everybody - our artists, techs and all who work on our show from front to back.  We are committed to a professional and safe work environment which includes working with professional designers and quality production values, hiring fight choreographers, dramaturgs and vocal coaches when necessary. </p>
<p><strong>This is <i>our largest production to date</i>. </strong>We need to pay 10 actors; set, light, costume and sound designers, a fight choreographer and backstage personnel including an Equity stage manager.</p>
<h3>The Breakdown</h3>
</div><div>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/3o752araLb61M6TovS/giphy.gif"" src=""""/></h3>
<p>We want to raise $15,000 towards our season.  Here is what we will use it for:</p>
<p>$5000 for our salons to pay stipends for guest artists, salon production manager and lighting design. </p>
<p>$10,000 for An American Ma(u)l) to pay for set, costumes, props, sound and lights  and additional actors.</p>
<p>One of our greatest challenges is balancing the cost of rehearsal, artists fees, production costs  (costumes, sets, props) and venue costs with an<strong> affordable ticket price</strong>.  We want to do excellent work and keep it affordable and accessible. It is a giant undertaking but with your help, we can complete this work and build our capacity as a theater company and continue to bring you excellent work.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal we will, of course, have to adjust our budget, maybe fewer light and sound cues, use the rickety chair in the hallway that rocks, wear our own clothes - but you don't want to see that happen!  Help us meet our goal.</p>
<h3>Perks! Perks! Perks!</h3>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/xULW8o1pLs4HicAp20/giphy.gif"" src=""""/></h3>
<p>In exchange for your support, we will share as much of the BACCE experience as you can stand. We offer chances to see the work in process, get to know the ensemble members,  participate in our process, break bread with us, listen to our music, wear our clothing and accessories and for the really brave - some <strong>deep black experiences</strong> like you can only get with BACCE.   Support our cause and we will pelt you with proper perks!!!  And of course, some really great performances!</p>

We have presented more than 10 new works by Black playwrights to San Francisco audiences - plays by Keith Josef Adkins, Robert Alexander, Pearl Cleage and Robert O'Hara and numerous staged readings of new plays.
We have received critical acclaim for all of our productions and formal recognition from Theater Bay Area Awards , in 2014 - Outstanding Ensemble for Sweet Maladies & 2017 - Acting nominations for Bootycandy. 
We are prepared to respond to the moment!  We participated in the New Black Fest national play event, Facing Our Truth, seven short plays by seven playwrights surrounding the murder of Trayvon Martin. 
Our So Soul San Francisco salons are part of a larger effort at documenting the Black performance history of San Francisco and the Bay Area. 
We are all separate and successful artists who have committed ourselves to building a company together - taking charge of our careers and taking responsibility for what's on stage.
This work is fiercely important and fills a myriad of voids, builds a bucketload of bridges, smashes seas of stereotypes and provokes a plethora of potent pontifications.


 
Project #1 - So Soul San Francisco: Black Art Salons
In  2018, we are curating a series of monthly Black Art Salons, on third Thursdays in Brava's new cabaret space.  We kick it all off on February 1 with Black Heaven: A Spiritual House Party.
  The first six salons are -

February 15 - Oju Ibeji features the work of  Melorra Green and Melonie Green who will offer ways to look and participate art that we guarantee you have not experienced.
March 15  -  Afro Present: Dreamtime in the endless twilight of 24/7 features the work of dancer/choreographer, Amara Tabor Smith and the legendary Ellen Sebastian Chang 
April 19  - Black Benatar's Black Magic Cabaret  with guest host, Beatrice Thomas (aka Black Benatar) 
May 17 - Black on Black: High Crimes and Misdemeanors, hosted by BACCE
June 21 - Black Music Salon featuring local musicians

We are seeking funding to pay salon artists and offer adequate technical support for each salon.
Project #2 - Robert O'Hara's An American Ma(u)l
A dsytopian comedy that is a bit too close to home right now.  A newly elected,rogue president jump starts a failing economy by reviving domestic slavery.  Mayhem ensues as neighbors - a black family and a white family, fight for a new normal.
Robert O'Hara, author of  Bootycandy and Barbecue, is in fine satiric form with the timely script.  We can't wait to bring this to the stage!
We are committed to paying  a decent wage to everybody - our artists, techs and all who work on our show from front to back.  We are committed to a professional and safe work environment which includes working with professional designers and quality production values, hiring fight choreographers, dramaturgs and vocal coaches when necessary. 
This is our largest production to date. We need to pay 10 actors; set, light, costume and sound designers, a fight choreographer and backstage personnel including an Equity stage manager.
The Breakdown


We want to raise $15,000 towards our season.  Here is what we will use it for:
$5000 for our salons to pay stipends for guest artists, salon production manager and lighting design. 
$10,000 for An American Ma(u)l) to pay for set, costumes, props, sound and lights  and additional actors.
One of our greatest challenges is balancing the cost of rehearsal, artists fees, production costs  (costumes, sets, props) and venue costs with an affordable ticket price.  We want to do excellent work and keep it affordable and accessible. It is a giant undertaking but with your help, we can complete this work and build our capacity as a theater company and continue to bring you excellent work.
If we don't reach our goal we will, of course, have to adjust our budget, maybe fewer light and sound cues, use the rickety chair in the hallway that rocks, wear our own clothes - but you don't want to see that happen!  Help us meet our goal.
Perks! Perks! Perks!

In exchange for your support, we will share as much of the BACCE experience as you can stand. We offer chances to see the work in process, get to know the ensemble members,  participate in our process, break bread with us, listen to our music, wear our clothing and accessories and for the really brave - some deep black experiences like you can only get with BACCE.   Support our cause and we will pelt you with proper perks!!!  And of course, some really great performances!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>A Dance Piece about angels, gods and humans</h3>
<p>is a way to investigate the sacred in the heart of mankind. Inspired by the work of Ovid in this dance  the bodies of the performers become a living collective, flowed through by an ethereal energy that transforms, adjusts and renames what hitherto was just formless. Watching it It's hard to avoid a certain spirituality because what you see and experience there is a bit of life from the outside, detached from stories and objects, fixed on the movement of their never-ending form-finding. Everything flows, Everything is changing!</p>

<p><u><strong>What We Need</strong></u></p>
<p>Impulse Repertory Co. is a small professional theatre company dedicated to producing intimate, provocative works that nurture the actor-audience relationship at the core of theatre through the lens of classical works.</p>
<p>As a newly minted 501(c)(3) nonprofit theatre company serving Atlanta by continuing to develop the talents, skills, aspirations, and contributions of the City's actor-artists, Impulse Rep is raising funds to produce its first professional rep season in August of 2017.</p>
<p>In light of recent uncertainties in the artistic community, donated funds are becoming the life blood of artistic ventures nationwide. Smaller arts ventures are coming to rely heavily on the generosity and artistic foresight of their patrons. If the arts are important to your community (and they are), your dollars represent your vote to keep them present and available, to nurture artists, and to develop future audiences by getting them up close and personal with the art itself.</p>
<p>Your donations also represent an opportunity to let your own voice be heard in the conversations that artists start, nurture, and provoke in the community.</p>
<p><u><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></u></p>
<p>In this campaign, we are seeking $20,000 (or more) in funding to produce the Summer 2017 Impulse Rep season: </p>
<p><i><strong>ANTIGONE</strong></i> by Sophocles<br/>directed by Kara Cantrell</p>
<p><i><strong>JULIUS CAESAR</strong></i> by William Shakespeare<br/>directed by Matt Lewis</p>
<p>Donors will receive recognition in our season materials, performance tickets, VIP treatment at our performances, gifts from our sponsor partners, and more depending on their giving level.</p>
<p>What happens if we don't reach our goal here on Indiegogo? The good news is: we still produce! Indiegogo will take a percentage of the funds and send the rest to us to continue towards our production goals. The bad news is: we'll be seeking further funding from other sources that may or may not be able to continue funding arts ventures in our community, and the depth and breadth of our productions becomes severely limited.</p>
<p><u><strong>The Impact</strong></u></p>
<p>The growing impact of the arts in Atlanta is undeniable. As you may know, the film industry has exploded in our City and our state in recent years. This has prompted a huge influx of artists and craftspeople in our region. These artists come for the jobs, certainly, but they stay in communities and environments that nurture them by allowing them to explore and appreciating their work. Our goal at Impulse Rep is to become a home base for actor-artists to create projects for themselves, to explore their craft in new and exciting ways, and to try their hands in different roles or positions.</p>
<p>In 2011 and 2012, Kara Cantrell produced three plays under the name, Impulse Rep, with great success. Partnering with the Alliance Theatre Education Department as our hosts, as well as directors Rachel Jones, Justin Anderson, and David Crowe, the productions of Medea, No Exit, and The Darker Places Trilogy by Atlanta playwright, Daniel Guyton, we had our first financial and critical successes. Now that the company has gone ""legit,"" we've onboarded six new members drawn from Atlanta's finest actor/directors to round out our resident company: Ken Hornbeck, Jessica McGuire, and Vallea Woodbury.</p>
<p><u><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></u></p>
<p>Nonprofit arts ventures are often difficult to get off the ground and we know we're entering the field at a time when major funding sources are being diminished.</p>
<p>Our plan for overcoming these challenges rests in the resident company's desire, expertise, and networks as artists. Our passionate team casts a City-wide, even region-wide net to pull and pool resources from fellow artists and art institutions, local and national businesses, personal relationships, and community service endeavors. A big net catches many fish.</p>
<p><u><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></u></p>
<p>Please know that even the smallest monetary donation helps, but if you're just not in a position to help financially at this time, you can still help in profoundly valuable ways:</p>
<p>Please share this campaign with your friends, family, colleagues, and neighbors via social media, e-mail, and one-on-one interactions. Be sure to use the Indiegogo tools!</p>
<p>Volunteer! We need people to assist with services such as house and box office management, set and costume building, securing loans of scenic, lighting, and sound equipment, running lighting, sound, or wardrobe during shows, and the list goes on. Please let us know if you can help out!</p>

This event gave a pair of each category (stage tango and track tango) a ticket directly to the semifinals. Two of the couples that have competed for Colombia have been among the finalists, and have managed to win the most recognition that can be aspired by a pair of dancers of this genre.</p><p>In 2006 Cali born, Carlos Paredes and Diana Giraldo, were the first non-Argentine couple were crowned world-wide champions of tango, in the stage category.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Nearly Naked Broadway needs your help to produce our first show. Venues in San Jose, CA are incredibly expensive (and the ones that aren't weren't particularly excited to host burlesque), and we want to be able to afford to produce more shows AND pay all of our contributors (dancers, tech, hosts, etc.!). We also want to make sure we have a marketing budget so people know when and where to show up.</p>
<p>Why do this show? Because we want to bring the South Bay theatre and burlesque communities together in support of one another's art:</p>
<p>This show is for burlesque dancers and theatre artists who wish they could show off their belting skills while taking off their belts and want to give a new definition to Kander &amp; Ebb's ol' razzle-dazzle. Everyone is encouraged to apply, regardless of their theatre resume, gender, abilities, etc. This show is intended to create a space for anyone who wants the chance to sing and dance their dream role — as long as they do it in their underwear. (Performers must, of course, submit an audition, but we’ll be casting a wide net for our casting!)</p>
<p><br/>It’s also for (adult) theatre audiences who want to see a whole new side of their favorite Broadway musicals. This show brings the Bay Area's burlesque and theatre community together, one musical theatre sacrilege at a time. If you’ve got an open mind, a good attitude, and a love for anyone from Cole Porter to Pasek and Paul, then we have a seat for you in our theatre. </p>
<p>We’re also giving back to the community: once we hit a certain ticket threshold (which is determined by the size of our theatre, so we can pay back the artists who contribute their time to this show), a percentage of the proceeds will be donated to a San Jose community charity. </p>
<p>This will be a regular show, produced either monthly or every other month. </p>

<p>What do YOU get out of all this? You get a professional quality show that will knock your socks off (while we take off our own). If you're interested in performing, you get a new venue to do so, where we'll challenge your creativity and give you a chance to sing and dance to the songs you've always dreamed of performing. You'll be keeping the spirit of Broadway alive here on the West Coast...and you'll be helping to keep Silicon Valley full of artists and makers and weirdos and sparkly unicorns. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>Our Commitment</strong></p>
<p>Nearly Naked Broadway is committed to body positivity, gender inclusivity, racial equity and justice, and community involvement. Our goal with this show is to give people of all abilities and backgrounds the chance to be cheered for, accepted, and appreciated. We strive to put on high quality performances to engage our audiences and to give back to our community and support our local artists whenever financially possible. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There is inherent risk in producing a show. If we don't reach our financial goals, then we run the risk of being unable to pay performers or, worse, have our producer go into serious debt. Art isn't easy -- and it's not cheap either. Until we can afford to run our own venue, we're at the mercy of rental prices in Silicon Valley -- which are skewed high by the tech folks who can afford $4K for a single event without batting an eye. We <i>need</i> to keep the arts alive in Silicon Valley, but we can't do it without your support! </p>

It is the combined vision of Think Fast Improv and Powerful Comedy to create an entertainment venue with a stage, bar and education center for performing arts. </p><p><strong>Think Fast Improv</strong> has been performing and teaching the art of improvisation in Honolulu since 2011. We have performed over 700 shows, 5 festival appearances and taught close to 900 classes and workshops, cultivating new generations of improvisers into the Honolulu scene and beyond.</p><p>In 2017 Pepper Lamb decided to combine his love of weightlifting with his love for comedy and created <strong>Powerfull Comedy</strong>. Since its founding, Pepper has opened for multiple mainland comedians and produced events all over Oahu. </p><p>After performing and promoting together for a few years we found a unified desire for a space of our own. A space that was not a bar first, stage second and a place where we could perform more than twice a month. We visited many potential locations around Honolulu until we found a perfect space for our new home. Located on 1128 Smith Street in Chinatown Honolulu, downstairs in the historic Tan Sing building built in 1900 (across the street from the delicious Little Village Noodle House) Downstage Honolulu was born. </p><p><strong>Downstage Honolulu</strong> is quickly becoming ready to open our stage and training rooms to whatever art will fit on our stage! We’ve been blessed by an amazing community of volunteer improvisers, comedians, poets, musicians and people that just love the arts who have helped us on our way. We are constantly reminded though their excitement and passion that this space is ultimately for them. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581768833/nnykjpz4ewqibjfyhb73.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3>What do we need help with?</h3><p>So far, we have overcome and completed some pretty big accomplishments:</p><ul>
<li>Paid our 3-month deposit</li>
<li>Covered our Insurance</li>
<li>Revived the rock wall once hidden by drywall and plaster</li>
<li>Hired a lawyer and began the process of acquiring our liquor license</li>
<li>Removed the old office layout with our own hands and sheer determination</li>
<li>Booked contractors to help us navigate our construction, plumbing, electrical and AC needs. </li>
</ul><p>The Education Center, bar and podcast side of the basement are nearing completion. The podcast room is taking shape, complete with some great podcast chairs Pepper acquired. We have even begun taking room reservations for podcast recording sessions, improv team rehearsals and classes, as well as welcomed established show promoters planning to move their events over to our stage. It is all very exciting for us and for the community!</p><p>With the guidance of our general contractors, we have done most of the heavy lifting for the demolition and remodeling on our own which also help us save money. We were able to salvage much of the previous tenant’s reception desk and will be re-purposing the wood for the ticket booth and theater area. Our friends have also helped us secure discounts on construction materials for the rebuild as well as donated wood for the stage from our good friend Shain Miller.  </p><p><strong>We have invested 8 years of savings and sweat into Downstage Honolulu</strong>. As with 120-year-old buildings, a couple of surprises were hidden behind walls, in the ceiling, and under tiles. Even with extra budgeting for unseen expenses, the costs are beginning to exceed the extra budgeted for surprises.</p><p>We are turning to Indiegogo for your help to get our community center back on track to open as a gathering space for improv, stand-up, and whatever art will fit on our stage. <strong>While we are on target to meet our immediate goals, this fundraiser will be an immense help to our future goals</strong> to take off running towards bigger productions and broader classes. </p><p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Here is where your support will go towards:</span></p><p><strong>AC System:</strong>  We were told that the unit had AC, and it does, it just needs some serious ductwork and maintenance that we discovered after starting renovations. We’re going to get some contractors to tell us what the cost of reworking the ducts is or if a new AC system is cheaper. </p><p><strong>Theater Floor: </strong>The huge reception desk was sunk below and attached to the subfloor instead of on the floorboards. Our friend Shane shared that patching would be more expensive in the long run than putting in a new floor now. He is going to get us additional quotes from his industry friends on floor replacement options. He has a very creative and cost-effective idea that will look amazing. </p><p><strong>Main Entrance:</strong> Our main entrance is in the center of the exterior of the building, opening into a grand staircase that descends down to our future ticket booth. The natural lighting in the day makes the entry look fantastic. However, because the previous tenants were all daytime hours, they never installed any lighting for nighttime. For everyone's safety we will need some lighting along the sides of the stairs and on the 20’ raised ceiling (need professional help for this part).  </p><p><strong>Security System:</strong> We do have one that was in the unit already,which was made before 60% of the founders were born. We found that sourcing VHS tapes for blurry black and white video would not be very cost effective. It will do for now while we are in construction, but we need a better system once all the equipment is in. We found a few replacement options that would be cost effective and provide security for the doors, bar and high traffic areas. </p><p><strong>Sound Baffling:</strong> Performing arts can be quiet and introspective, loud and rambunctious, and everything in between. We want to make sure that the Education Center has good sound reduction. Our friend Lock Lynch provided us some great cost-effective options to reduce the sound from outside and between each classroom. </p><p><strong>Stage Lighting: </strong>During the expansion of the theater area, we removed a dividing wall where we discovered that there was extensive duct work above that limited our ability to remove and flatten the ceiling for lighting. Through Rory’s theater tech experience, he found alternative low profile lighting that we can use that won’t cook the audience but costs $1,000 above budgeted allowance.</p><p><strong>Ceiling Renovation: </strong>We also found a hole in our ceiling / the nice hardwood flooring of our upstairs restaurant neighbor. As nice as the tenants are upstairs, we want to make sure drinks and dip from the restaurant don’t drip onto our community. Removal of portion of ceiling, fix the hole, and patch the ceiling.</p><p>We do have the minimum funds to cover some of these issues, and your support will help us regain our lost ground covering these surprise costs. The sooner we can work towards covering these expenses, the sooner we can work toward our vision as Downstage Honolulu!</p><p> </p><h3>Stretch Goals</h3><p>We are so fortunate to have our new home in the heart of Chinatown. We have watched this arts district grow over the last decade with niche food havens, holiday block parties and a bustling scene of music and performances. We want to live up to this new Chinatown look and would like to be able to open with some flair. After our needs are taken care of any additional funds you beautiful people bless us with will be used towards the following.</p><p><strong>Podcasting:</strong> We have a podcast room full of awesome equipment and comfortable chairs from Pepper. If we have left over donations, we would like to sound baffle this room as well. With the bar right outside we want to make it extra audio-friendly.</p><p><strong>Live-streaming:</strong> We have a wonderful professional live-streaming technician that has offered her expertise to set up our space with live-streaming capabilities. We would love for her to come assist us with installing the proper equipment to live-stream and record shows for performers to use for festival submissions and promotions. </p><p><strong>Bathroom Upgrades:</strong> Since we’re sound baffling everything else why not the bathrooms. It's just more comfortable when you know that any sound coming out the door is reduced by a few more decibels. Better fan ventilation never hurts either. </p><h3> </h3><h3>What Do You Get?</h3><p>We brainstormed real good and hard over the perks we could give for your generous support. We also wanted to make sure that we had options for everybody both in our neighborhood and across the world!</p><p><strong>All perks will come with (1) ticket to our Indiegogo Thank You weekend!</strong> With your Indiegogo donation, you will get the red carpet treatment into our new home for any show during our Thank You Fundraiser weekend.

It is the combined vision of Think Fast Improv and Powerful Comedy to create an entertainment venue with a stage, bar and education center for performing arts. Think Fast Improv has been performing and teaching the art of improvisation in Honolulu since 2011. We have performed over 700 shows, 5 festival appearances and taught close to 900 classes and workshops, cultivating new generations of improvisers into the Honolulu scene and beyond.In 2017 Pepper Lamb decided to combine his love of weightlifting with his love for comedy and created Powerfull Comedy. Since its founding, Pepper has opened for multiple mainland comedians and produced events all over Oahu. After performing and promoting together for a few years we found a unified desire for a space of our own. A space that was not a bar first, stage second and a place where we could perform more than twice a month. We visited many potential locations around Honolulu until we found a perfect space for our new home. Located on 1128 Smith Street in Chinatown Honolulu, downstairs in the historic Tan Sing building built in 1900 (across the street from the delicious Little Village Noodle House) Downstage Honolulu was born. Downstage Honolulu is quickly becoming ready to open our stage and training rooms to whatever art will fit on our stage! We’ve been blessed by an amazing community of volunteer improvisers, comedians, poets, musicians and people that just love the arts who have helped us on our way. We are constantly reminded though their excitement and passion that this space is ultimately for them.  What do we need help with?So far, we have overcome and completed some pretty big accomplishments:
Paid our 3-month deposit
Covered our Insurance
Revived the rock wall once hidden by drywall and plaster
Hired a lawyer and began the process of acquiring our liquor license
Removed the old office layout with our own hands and sheer determination
Booked contractors to help us navigate our construction, plumbing, electrical and AC needs. 
The Education Center, bar and podcast side of the basement are nearing completion. The podcast room is taking shape, complete with some great podcast chairs Pepper acquired. We have even begun taking room reservations for podcast recording sessions, improv team rehearsals and classes, as well as welcomed established show promoters planning to move their events over to our stage. It is all very exciting for us and for the community!With the guidance of our general contractors, we have done most of the heavy lifting for the demolition and remodeling on our own which also help us save money. We were able to salvage much of the previous tenant’s reception desk and will be re-purposing the wood for the ticket booth and theater area. Our friends have also helped us secure discounts on construction materials for the rebuild as well as donated wood for the stage from our good friend Shain Miller.  We have invested 8 years of savings and sweat into Downstage Honolulu. As with 120-year-old buildings, a couple of surprises were hidden behind walls, in the ceiling, and under tiles. Even with extra budgeting for unseen expenses, the costs are beginning to exceed the extra budgeted for surprises.We are turning to Indiegogo for your help to get our community center back on track to open as a gathering space for improv, stand-up, and whatever art will fit on our stage. While we are on target to meet our immediate goals, this fundraiser will be an immense help to our future goals to take off running towards bigger productions and broader classes. Here is where your support will go towards:AC System:  We were told that the unit had AC, and it does, it just needs some serious ductwork and maintenance that we discovered after starting renovations. We’re going to get some contractors to tell us what the cost of reworking the ducts is or if a new AC system is cheaper. Theater Floor: The huge reception desk was sunk below and attached to the subfloor instead of on the floorboards. Our friend Shane shared that patching would be more expensive in the long run than putting in a new floor now. He is going to get us additional quotes from his industry friends on floor replacement options. He has a very creative and cost-effective idea that will look amazing. Main Entrance: Our main entrance is in the center of the exterior of the building, opening into a grand staircase that descends down to our future ticket booth. The natural lighting in the day makes the entry look fantastic. However, because the previous tenants were all daytime hours, they never installed any lighting for nighttime. For everyone's safety we will need some lighting along the sides of the stairs and on the 20’ raised ceiling (need professional help for this part).  Security System: We do have one that was in the unit already,which was made before 60% of the founders were born. We found that sourcing VHS tapes for blurry black and white video would not be very cost effective. It will do for now while we are in construction, but we need a better system once all the equipment is in. We found a few replacement options that would be cost effective and provide security for the doors, bar and high traffic areas. Sound Baffling: Performing arts can be quiet and introspective, loud and rambunctious, and everything in between. We want to make sure that the Education Center has good sound reduction. Our friend Lock Lynch provided us some great cost-effective options to reduce the sound from outside and between each classroom. Stage Lighting: During the expansion of the theater area, we removed a dividing wall where we discovered that there was extensive duct work above that limited our ability to remove and flatten the ceiling for lighting. Through Rory’s theater tech experience, he found alternative low profile lighting that we can use that won’t cook the audience but costs $1,000 above budgeted allowance.Ceiling Renovation: We also found a hole in our ceiling / the nice hardwood flooring of our upstairs restaurant neighbor. As nice as the tenants are upstairs, we want to make sure drinks and dip from the restaurant don’t drip onto our community. Removal of portion of ceiling, fix the hole, and patch the ceiling.We do have the minimum funds to cover some of these issues, and your support will help us regain our lost ground covering these surprise costs. The sooner we can work towards covering these expenses, the sooner we can work toward our vision as Downstage Honolulu! Stretch GoalsWe are so fortunate to have our new home in the heart of Chinatown. We have watched this arts district grow over the last decade with niche food havens, holiday block parties and a bustling scene of music and performances. We want to live up to this new Chinatown look and would like to be able to open with some flair. After our needs are taken care of any additional funds you beautiful people bless us with will be used towards the following.Podcasting: We have a podcast room full of awesome equipment and comfortable chairs from Pepper. If we have left over donations, we would like to sound baffle this room as well. With the bar right outside we want to make it extra audio-friendly.Live-streaming: We have a wonderful professional live-streaming technician that has offered her expertise to set up our space with live-streaming capabilities. We would love for her to come assist us with installing the proper equipment to live-stream and record shows for performers to use for festival submissions and promotions. Bathroom Upgrades: Since we’re sound baffling everything else why not the bathrooms. It's just more comfortable when you know that any sound coming out the door is reduced by a few more decibels. Better fan ventilation never hurts either.  What Do You Get?We brainstormed real good and hard over the perks we could give for your generous support. We also wanted to make sure that we had options for everybody both in our neighborhood and across the world!All perks will come with (1) ticket to our Indiegogo Thank You weekend! With your Indiegogo donation, you will get the red carpet treatment into our new home for any show during our Thank You Fundraiser weekend.

In line with our vision of supporting Hawaii businesses, our limited edition shirts and stickers are locally produced by our neighbors up the street from us: Blank Canvas! We have some perks that will appeal to our local friends and fans

But when Anna tried to imagine how she could direct the classic work in such a way that would reckon with the real-life complications of such forgiveness, she fell short. The text, after all, was the text.</p><p>            The only way to use the story to subvert its own themes would be to change that text.</p><p>            The only thing to do was rewrite it.</p><p>            Anna and Beating of Wings are excited to be developing this play with the Noise Now program at A Noise Within Theatre- and it’s pretty cool that the company is producing the source material as part of their season, providing an ideal platform on which to present this new theatrical companion piece.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567380997/npap2nlnjsarrxaikbnd.jpg"" src=""""/>                     <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567381014/l5pocwjgxe6mmjymq3h8.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>What makes the play important:</strong></p><p>            William Shakespeare’s <i>The Winter’s Tale</i> could be said to ask the question: “how can we forgive?” But in 2019, when violence is a daily reality for many women and when movements like #MeToo and #TimesUp are finally starting to force a reckoning between victims and perpetrators, a more poignant question to ask might be: what about the times when we can’t forgive? Is it possible to move forward, and to heal, in those moments when catastrophic violence can’t be erased with miraculous forgiveness?</p><p>            <strong>Through text both classic and original and through song, dance, and modern poetry, <i>A Sad Tale’s Best for Winter</i> explores these questions by interrupting and disrupting Shakespeare’s text-</strong> bringing the story into a fantasy world where women live isolated from men, where bears hide behind trees in relentless pursuit, and where a new generation struggles to undo centuries' worth of fear, pain, and violence in the hopes of creating a new, better world. </p><p>            <i>A Sad Tale's Best for Winter</i> celebrates and preserves the language and resonance of Shakespeare's original text, while also creating a new story uniquely appropriate for our current time- and a new story uniquely geared toward expressing a version of the female experience in a way that is understandable and relatable for all audiences.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567381094/ybe6axb6tfuivljqnzyc.jpg"" src=""""/>                        <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567381123/vnyhfyzazkcxuiusbryj.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>What We Need, and What You Get:</strong></p><p>          A Noise Within is generously offering us the in-kind donation of free rehearsal and performance space; however, we are entirely responsible for funding every other production cost ourselves, including set and costumes, marketing, and of course, artist stipends.  </p><p>            <strong>Beating of Wings is proud to say that 85% of our funds to be raised will be going directly toward paying our artists</strong> (such as Chris Meissner, who made our amazing promo video for us!).

We're Beating of Wings, a determined group of women artists committed to building an inclusive  and supportive artistic community and to producing new, vital, and socially conscious work.          We're taking on our first major production project with this developmental workshop of A Sad Tale’s Best for Winter, a new feminist adaption of William Shakespeare's The Winter’s Tale written and directed by BoW Founding Artistic Director Anna Miles- and along the way, we're also starting a conversation about the classic theatrical canon through fresh, innovative text and storytelling. Performing one night only, on Sunday, November 17th at 6:30 PM upstairs at A Noise Within Theater in Pasadena, CA- tickets are all general admission and pay-what-you-can, and are available now at anoisewithin.org/noise-now!       But we can't do it alone- we're fortunate to be developing and performing this play in residency with the Noise Now program at A Noise Within Theatre, but we still need your help to breathe life into this exciting new play!      How the play was born:            A Sad Tale’s Best for Winter was born a year ago, while writer Anna Miles was watching a production of William Shakespeare’s The Winter’s Tale in an Orange County park- as the play unfolded, she grew increasingly frustrated with how easily and quickly the male protagonist, Leontes, was forgiven in the play, even after wreaking violent havoc on his wife and children. But when Anna tried to imagine how she could direct the classic work in such a way that would reckon with the real-life complications of such forgiveness, she fell short. The text, after all, was the text.            The only way to use the story to subvert its own themes would be to change that text.            The only thing to do was rewrite it.            Anna and Beating of Wings are excited to be developing this play with the Noise Now program at A Noise Within Theatre- and it’s pretty cool that the company is producing the source material as part of their season, providing an ideal platform on which to present this new theatrical companion piece.                      What makes the play important:            William Shakespeare’s The Winter’s Tale could be said to ask the question: “how can we forgive?” But in 2019, when violence is a daily reality for many women and when movements like #MeToo and #TimesUp are finally starting to force a reckoning between victims and perpetrators, a more poignant question to ask might be: what about the times when we can’t forgive? Is it possible to move forward, and to heal, in those moments when catastrophic violence can’t be erased with miraculous forgiveness?            Through text both classic and original and through song, dance, and modern poetry, A Sad Tale’s Best for Winter explores these questions by interrupting and disrupting Shakespeare’s text- bringing the story into a fantasy world where women live isolated from men, where bears hide behind trees in relentless pursuit, and where a new generation struggles to undo centuries' worth of fear, pain, and violence in the hopes of creating a new, better world.             A Sad Tale's Best for Winter celebrates and preserves the language and resonance of Shakespeare's original text, while also creating a new story uniquely appropriate for our current time- and a new story uniquely geared toward expressing a version of the female experience in a way that is understandable and relatable for all audiences.                         What We Need, and What You Get:          A Noise Within is generously offering us the in-kind donation of free rehearsal and performance space; however, we are entirely responsible for funding every other production cost ourselves, including set and costumes, marketing, and of course, artist stipends.              Beating of Wings is proud to say that 85% of our funds to be raised will be going directly toward paying our artists (such as Chris Meissner, who made our amazing promo video for us!). Besides Chris, we also have twelve actors, a choreographer, a composer/music director, a director, and an assistant director who all deserve to be compensated for their incredible talents-  and funding the production upfront allows us to keep our tickets ""pay-what-you-can,"" ensuring maximum audience accessibility.If we reach our stretch goal of $7,300, we'll also be able to offer small stipends to each producer on our producing team, who have been working tirelessly (and completely for free) since January!            And you won't be alone in supporting us: over fifty people have already shown us their support by attending and donating to our fundraising event in July, through which we were able to raise 10% of our budget. At said event, thirteen incredible women also donated their time and talents in support of our show and our mission. We are also the beneficiaries of in-kind costume donations from The Woodland Opera House and further in-kind space donations from The Wit Theatre. They all believe in us, and we hope you believe in us too!            Perks!            So, what's in it for you, besides the warm fuzzy feeling that comes with supporting awesome and important art? We've come up with a few perks to sweeten the deal when you donate, including:
custom Beating of Wings merch
 VIP seating
 tickets to our future projects
 the chance to earn some bespoke art made just for you from one or more of our incredible artists!
                             Why You Can Trust Us With Your Contribution:            Beating of Wings has a consistent track record of producing unique, interesting, and excellent work: in only seven months, the collective has produced two original concert and storytelling events, organized the production of an original photo series, and has partnered with members on two short films as well as participating in a nation-wide play reading event aimed at encouraging voter registration. Not only that, but we're an incredibly tenacious group: all of our previous projects have been produced with zero-to-no budget, completely independently. We know how to make theater happen, and make it happen well- and it will be the same with A Sad Tale's Best for Winter. The only difference is, this time, with your help, we'll be able to pay everyone!           The Team:Anna Miles, Writer and Director            Anna Miles is the Founding Artistic Director of Beating of Wings. Some of her most recent projects include the extremely successful productions Daddy Long Legs: The Musical (Director) and Think of Me, Fred Weasley (Writer, Director, Performer).

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Dear one,</span></h3>
<p>We hope this letter finds you healthy and happy, and active in your imagination. We are writing to you because we are making a work of dance-theater to premiere January 2020 in NYC, and we humbly and excitedly ask for your help.</p>
<h3>Here's a bit about our show:</h3>
<p><i>A land creature and a sky creature who are deeply in love learn that the earth is falling out of the sky.</i></p>
<p>At the intersection of dance and theater, abstraction and narrative, sci-fi and fable, The Pigeon &amp; The Mouse is a love story about two people forced to leave home in the wake of civil war. We, co-choreographers and performers Tony Bordonaro and Ingrid Kapteyn, invite you, our audience, to join us in the practice of what homo sapiens do best: use fiction and fantasy as a means to survive.</p>
<h3>Here's a bit about us:</h3>
<p>We, Tony and Ingrid, first met while performing in <i>Sleep No More</i> NYC in 2013, and we later spent a year together in China as part of the original cast of <i>Sleep No More</i> Shanghai. Our first creation, CAMPFIRE, tested the limits of human empathy through a story about the last two people on earth. We premiered it with a run of sold out shows in an office space in downtown Shanghai that was still under construction, where the audience moved with us through an entire gutted floor of a building strewn with rubble and debris. We later presented CAMPFIRE in The Tank's intimate 56-seat blackbox in midtown Manhattan, with a two-part immersive scent sculpture that diffused toxic-seeming metallic notes into the hint of campfire embers. The Pigeon &amp; The Mouse acts as a kind of alternate-universe prequel to CAMPFIRE.</p>
<h3>Here's why we need you:</h3>
<p>In order to offer you, our audience, the truest possible experience of our love story, and to honor the creative work we've been pouring ourselves into for the last year, we are investing in the quality of our production and our collaborators. We seek the support of our community to help cover some of the expenses that come with self-producing:</p>

<p>We are Isabella Kuëss and Max von Lütgendorff and are both opera singers based in beautiful Vienna, Austria! In January 2020, we co-founded <strong>BelCanto Arts</strong> (<a href=""http://www.belcantoarts.at"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.belcantoarts.at</a>), a nonprofit concert agency creating innovative productions that re-imagine classical concepts onto the concert and opera stage.</p>
<p>In 2020 it is even more important to us to be able to support our hard-hit artistic colleagues and build up a grassroots aspect of the cultural scene. We are stubbornly building that future right now.</p>
<p>So how do we plan to do all this?</p>
<p>BelCanto Arts is bringing <strong>FIDELIO</strong> on stage in a new production by German director <i>Annegret Ritzel</i>. Not content with being one of a hundred companies who interpret Fidelio for Beethoven's 250th birth year, we have decided to do something special: framing the opera as it was written with a surrounding storyline that incorporates the idea of Beethoven's famous Immortal Beloved as well as playing around with the isolation we have all one way or another experienced this year.<br/>Our cast of brilliant international soloists under up-and-coming conductor <i>Daniel Strahilevitz</i> will be accompanied by our own <i>Chorus BelCanto</i> and the <i>United Europe Orchestra</i>. We are playing four performances this November (19., 22., 27. and 29.11.2020) and are planning another series for 2021.</p>
<p>We are very excited that we can actually produce this opera in <strong>November 2020</strong>, but like everyone, we had to cancel quite a few concerts that should have supported our big production this year. We are also planning a CD and making a live video production of our Fidelio Performances for DVD, that will also be downloadable from our website <a href=""http://www.belcantoarts.at"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.belcantoarts.at</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>We need <u>your</u> help to reach our goals:</strong></p>
<p><strong>- paying every soloist, chorist and musician fairly (total of €12000)</strong></p>
<p><strong>- recording a CD instead of the concert series we should have done this year (€3000)</strong></p>
<p><strong>- creating a live video recording of our Fidelio production for everyone who can't come and experience it live. (€3000)</strong></p>
<p> </p>

<p><b>Why I am doing this. 
</b></p>
<p>My name is Elizabeth Bowering and I have a terminal neurological disease called Multiple
System Atrophy (MSA). Most people have never heard of MSA. It is very aggressive and devastating and there is no
treatment at this time. Research in the area has been limited due to a lack of funding.
There has been no ice bucket challenge for MSA like there has been for ALS, a disease with
similar symptoms and outcome.  Advances in earlier diagnosis
and treatment for MSA are desperately needed and I want to help make this happen. <br/></p>
<p><b>What I plan to do</b><br/></p><p>I am going to remount a play that I wrote in 2006 which
enjoyed much success at Edmonton’s International Fringe Theatre Festival. I plan
this as a fundraiser for research and an awareness campaign for MSA. The play is
near and dear to my heart because it is based on the true story of my
grandmother. At age 16, she saved the lives of those on board a sailing vessel when
it met with peril at sea. <i>Wind in her
Sails</i> is an historical play that takes place entirely on a schooner off the
coast of Newfoundland in 1907. </p>
<p>In November 2015, with the help of a devoted team of
volunteers, this show will run for ten days. After expenses, proceeds from the
production will be directly earmarked for clinical trials to be conducted by Toronto
movement disorder specialist <a href=""http://windinhersails.com/?page_id=68"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dr.
Anthony Lang</a> who is investigating new ways of diagnostic imaging for this
disease. </p>
<p><b>What we need</b><br/></p><p>We need seed money to put on this production! Although
there is a strong group of volunteers, we must pay the cast, rent, insurance, playbills
etc. Rest assured that your support will take us one step closer to fulfilling my
dream of helping to fund a clinical trial for Multiple System Atrophy. </p>
<p>Any research will unlikely be of any help to me at my
stage of the disease, but Dr. Anthony Lang’s clinical trials in Toronto are
leading the way in Canada to finding an earlier diagnosis for MSA. The sooner
it is detected, the sooner treatments may be discovered.</p>
<p><b>What you can do</b><br/></p><p>I wrote <i>Wind in her

<p><strong>Project mission</strong>: Our mission is bringing
renewed awareness to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the city of Philadelphia, which
is 5% above the national average in
terms of new cases reported. This project uses the play as a context to address
sensitive subjects and will ultimately achieve three goals; bring awareness,
create dialogue, and increase testing. By using the medium of Theater and a
multi-location panel discussion we will open a dialogue about the motifs and
themes of the play including, HIV/AIDS awareness, the stigma surrounding those
who test positive, the development and progression of the gay rights movement
since the 1980’s and the cultural impact of interracial relationships. </p>
<p><strong>Proposal Summary:</strong> This project will launch on
November 30th the day before World Aids Day and AIDS awareness month. On November 30th, in partnership with Temple
University Paley Library we will hold a panel, 'Religion and the LGBT Community: Post Marriage Equality"" . We've confirmed a stellar line up of religious leaders, scholars, media professionals, and politicians to spark a dialogue on the impact of  the issues
highlighted.  From December 2nd - 6th, the show will take go up at Studio 5  @ The Walnut Street
Theatre. Rapid HIV testing will be available during a show. </p>
<p><strong>Project background and biographies:</strong> You Gotta Eat Dirt Before You Die is a play
written by Dr. Kimmika Williams-Witherspoon and directed by Malcolm Kenyatta-Greeen.
The play, set in the 1980's follows, Jeffery an African American business
professional whose lover Nick,  is dying from Aids at the very start of the
epidemic, simultaneously his mother is dying of cancer. Written in an almost novella format it transports you to a time
when HIV and AIDS were not readily discussed above a whisper and interracial
relationships, especially gay ones were looked at with more than a wayward
glance. It's a story that causes us to re-examine the progression of treatment
since the 1980's to present day, exploring where we've come and where we have left to go.</p>

Target population :</strong> </p>
<p>This project will
bring together a wide array of individuals, but will focus on the target
communities that are impact by the disease the most aggressively (LGBT
individuals and Communities of Color). In addition to seeking out local and
national media attention we will target universities, public health
organizations, the gayborhood, art based organizations and non-for-profit
organizations to reach out to the audience we seek. We will also  utilize tools such as social media, palm
cards, and if budget permits we’ll seek out low cost highly visible marketing
tools (i.e. Septa ads or bill board ads) </p>

since the 1980’s and the cultural impact of interracial relationships. 
Proposal Summary: This project will launch on
November 30th the day before World Aids Day and AIDS awareness month. On November 30th, in partnership with Temple
University Paley Library we will hold a panel, 'Religion and the LGBT Community: Post Marriage Equality"" . We've confirmed a stellar line up of religious leaders, scholars, media professionals, and politicians to spark a dialogue on the impact of  the issues
highlighted.  From December 2nd - 6th, the show will take go up at Studio 5  @ The Walnut Street
Theatre. Rapid HIV testing will be available during a show. 
Project background and biographies: You Gotta Eat Dirt Before You Die is a play
written by Dr. Kimmika Williams-Witherspoon and directed by Malcolm Kenyatta-Greeen.
The play, set in the 1980's follows, Jeffery an African American business
professional whose lover Nick,  is dying from Aids at the very start of the
epidemic, simultaneously his mother is dying of cancer. Written in an almost novella format it transports you to a time
when HIV and AIDS were not readily discussed above a whisper and interracial
relationships, especially gay ones were looked at with more than a wayward
glance. It's a story that causes us to re-examine the progression of treatment
since the 1980's to present day, exploring where we've come and where we have left to go.

communities that are impact by the disease the most aggressively (LGBT
individuals and Communities of Color). In addition to seeking out local and
national media attention we will target universities, public health
organizations, the gayborhood, art based organizations and non-for-profit
organizations to reach out to the audience we seek. We will also  utilize tools such as social media, palm
cards, and if budget permits we’ll seek out low cost highly visible marketing
tools (i.e. Septa ads or bill board ads) 
Project funding: This project is being funded
using every method possible (donations: tax deductible and non-deductible,
crowd funding, and business contributions, and playbill ads; truly a grass roots effort.

<ul>
<li><p>Air Travel - $3,500  3 plane tickets from LA to Edinburgh - 2 performers &amp; our director.  We are covering the other 2 plane tickets (between $2300 &amp; $2400, we think) out of pocket.  The airlines seem to have figured out that there's this big festival in Edinburgh this time of year, and 'deals' are basically nonexistent even 5 months out.</p></li>
<li><p>Venue - $3,100 The non-negotiable cost of using the fabulous SpaceTriplex, a dream venue, for our 2 week run.</p></li>
<li><p>Housing - $3,800 The absolute cheapest apartment we have been able to find that is even remotely close enough to our venue costs this much, and comes out to about $760/person for two weeks.  Remember, we won't have a car - we will have to carry a harmonium, accordion, ukulele, banjo, trumpet, along with our props and costume pieces to and from the theater every evening, and to and from the Royal Mile for busking each day, so let's just say that location is key.</p></li>
<li><p>SOOOO CLOSE! -Advertising - $1,500 This will cover a single 1/8th page ad in the Edinburgh Fringe Programme.  It's steep, but it is our best opportunity to reach our audience.  We will be paying for flyers, posters, and any other ads out of pocket.  And busking daily, of course, right out on the Royal Mile!</p></li>
<li><p>FUNDED - THANK YOU!!! Insurance - $200 We are required to show proof of insurance by our venue.</p></li>
<li><p>FUNDED - THANK YOU!!! Fringe Registration - $450 We gotta pay up to join the PARTY! </p></li>
<li><p>Other costs (and there are a lot!)...are a responsibility we are taking on.  Feeding ourselves. Costuming the show. Designing the show for our new venue.  Flyers, posters, additional ads. We will have to pay a Foreign Entertainers' Tax...and all this is just to start.  More costs are going to come up.  But with your help, none of us will end up too far in the hole before we even begin.  We are hoping to raise more than our goal, but we are trying to be (a little bit) realistic, as IndieGoGo takes a much bigger cut of funds raised if we don't at least reach our goal.  </p></li>

SOOOO CLOSE! -Advertising - $1,500 This will cover a single 1/8th page ad in the Edinburgh Fringe Programme.  It's steep, but it is our best opportunity to reach our audience.  We will be paying for flyers, posters, and any other ads out of pocket.  And busking daily, of course, right out on the Royal Mile!
FUNDED - THANK YOU!!! Insurance - $200 We are required to show proof of insurance by our venue.
FUNDED - THANK YOU!!! Fringe Registration - $450 We gotta pay up to join the PARTY! 
Other costs (and there are a lot!)...are a responsibility we are taking on.  Feeding ourselves. Costuming the show. Designing the show for our new venue.  Flyers, posters, additional ads. We will have to pay a Foreign Entertainers' Tax...and all this is just to start.  More costs are going to come up.  But with your help, none of us will end up too far in the hole before we even begin.  We are hoping to raise more than our goal, but we are trying to be (a little bit) realistic, as IndieGoGo takes a much bigger cut of funds raised if we don't at least reach our goal.  
TOTAL BUDGET...$14,850+ 
TOTAL IndieGoGo FUNDRAISING GOAL...$10,000

<h3>Our Audience<br/>
</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.talkingwithangels.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TALKING WITH ANGELS</a> is first and foremost an inspirational message for
 those who have questioned mainstream religion yet remain deeply 
spiritual in their own way. Self-awareness, mindfulness and authenticity are at the 
center of many conversations these days, and these subjects 
are at the center of Talking with Angels.  <br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This play is about the power of a few
people and their tremendous spiritual power as individuals.  Talking with Angels is not simply vehicle for entertainment and not solely
a spiritual text meant for solitary study; this performance is a co-creation where
audience meets actor for a spiritual infusion.</p>

<h3>Based on a True Story<br/>
</h3>
<a href=""http://www.dialogues-ange.fr/talking_with_angels/dialogues_en.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TALKING WITH ANGELS </a>is the true
story of four young Hungarian artists, their search for meaning and their encounter with transcendent forces.  Over a period of 17 months, despite the chaos in Nazi-occupied Hungary, the artists Gitta Mallasz, Lili Strauss, Joseph Kreutzer and Hanna Dallos held weekly meetings every Friday afternoon from June 1943 to December 1944. During these meetings, Hanna received messages from four angels --four distinctly different personalities-- who gave counsel and comfort to the quartet.  In 1976, Gitta Mallasz turned the transcripts from these meetings into the book Talking with Angels which Shelley Mitchell then adapted into her critically acclaimed one-woman play.<br/><br/><blockquote>TALKING WITH ANGELS is a tour de force by Shelley
 Mitchell. Solo on a bare stage with just mind, body, imagination and 
chutzpa to sustain her, she morphs herself through different characters 
and creates a marvelous ensemble drama out of thin air. Its a wonder to 
behold. <b>CARROLL BALLARD, filmmaker (The Black Stallion)</b><br/>

<h3>Gitta Mallasz<br/>
</h3>
<p>Gitta Mallasz, a professional graphic artist and theatrical set designer,  survived the war and immigrated to Paris in 1960.  She took the twelve notebooks containing the dialogues with her, hidden from the Hungarian border guards who would have destroyed them. They were published in 1976, 
        as Dialogue avec L’Ange and immediately became a bestseller.  (<a href=""http://ad-dialoguesange.org/dialogues-avec-ange/le-livre-de-chevet-de-juliette-binoche/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Juliette Binoche</a>, an ardent fan of the book, keeps it as a constant companion and inspiration for her work as an actress.)  The book in its original language (Az Angyal Vàlaszol) was so controversial it was 
        banned by the communist regime in Hungary until 1991. In May, 2012, <a href=""http://www1.yadvashem.org/yv/en/exhibitions/righteous-sportsmen/index.asp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Yad Vashem awarded Gitta Mallasz with Israel's highest civilian honor as Righteous Among Nations</a>.</p>

thunderstruck by it's non-dualistic, Buddhist and Sufi-like message and instantly

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p><i><strong>She-Wolves</strong></i> is an original one-woman performance blending dance, theatre, song, animated projection and sound design. An adaptation of the book by historian Helen Castor, it portrays little-known episodes in medieval history when royal women attempted to rule in a world where power was inescapably male. Five historical figures and their astonishing stories are brought to life for modern audiences by combining historical detail with contemporary arts and fashion. Each queen (or almost-queen) is given individual flavour through a collaboration with an artist in a different creative medium.</p>
<p>The show will go on to tour the UK and the US with an accompanying programme of educational activities designed to celebrate unrecognized women in England's history. We are especially excited about bringing the show to the historical sites where the action really happened, such as battlefields, castles and abbeys, which are often located in rural areas that are under-served by professional art-makers. We'll connect with local groups such as schools, libraries, women's groups and historical societies with the goal of creating positive and inclusive environments for self-expression, group reflection and discussion, and conflict transformation.</p>
<p>To find out more, visit <a href=""http://www.shewolvesproject.com/she-wolves-story/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">our gorgeous website</a></p>
<p>And please explore and share on Instagram and Twitter @shewolvespro - there will be a daily behind-the-scenes sneaky peek as we count down to our Edinburgh Fringe debut on August 13!</p>

<h3>She-Wolves in Edinburgh</h3>
<p>The Edinburgh Fringe Festival is the largest arts festival in the world. Debuting the show there will allow us to refine the artistic side of the project while also making contact with the presenters, producers and media who can help us move the project forward. The Arts Council of England (where the project is based) does not fund  activities in Scotland, so this is an exciting opportunity for you to become a Producing Partner of the project! Every contribution is important and your support is deeply valued.</p>
<p>The money we're asking for will contribute to </p>
<p>- final development costs, such as Belle's beautiful illustrations and Anne's gorgeous costumes</p>
<p>- venue hire</p>
<p>- travel and accommodation for the artistic team</p>
<p>- marketing materials such as flyers, posters and photocalls</p>
<p>Our total costs come out to more than we are asking for, and so we'll be funding with private money as well. We believe in this show and the power of these stories!</p>

</div></div>","The Project
She-Wolves is an original one-woman performance blending dance, theatre, song, animated projection and sound design. An adaptation of the book by historian Helen Castor, it portrays little-known episodes in medieval history when royal women attempted to rule in a world where power was inescapably male. Five historical figures and their astonishing stories are brought to life for modern audiences by combining historical detail with contemporary arts and fashion. Each queen (or almost-queen) is given individual flavour through a collaboration with an artist in a different creative medium.
The show will go on to tour the UK and the US with an accompanying programme of educational activities designed to celebrate unrecognized women in England's history. We are especially excited about bringing the show to the historical sites where the action really happened, such as battlefields, castles and abbeys, which are often located in rural areas that are under-served by professional art-makers. We'll connect with local groups such as schools, libraries, women's groups and historical societies with the goal of creating positive and inclusive environments for self-expression, group reflection and discussion, and conflict transformation.

And please explore and share on Instagram and Twitter @shewolvespro - there will be a daily behind-the-scenes sneaky peek as we count down to our Edinburgh Fringe debut on August 13!

She-Wolves in Edinburgh
The Edinburgh Fringe Festival is the largest arts festival in the world. Debuting the show there will allow us to refine the artistic side of the project while also making contact with the presenters, producers and media who can help us move the project forward. The Arts Council of England (where the project is based) does not fund  activities in Scotland, so this is an exciting opportunity for you to become a Producing Partner of the project! Every contribution is important and your support is deeply valued.
The money we're asking for will contribute to 
- final development costs, such as Belle's beautiful illustrations and Anne's gorgeous costumes
- venue hire
- travel and accommodation for the artistic team
- marketing materials such as flyers, posters and photocalls
Our total costs come out to more than we are asking for, and so we'll be funding with private money as well. We believe in this show and the power of these stories!

<h3>The Story </h3>
<p><br/>The Asian Pacific American (APA) population is seriously under represented on screen and on stage. ""<strong>Our Perspective: Asian American Play Readings</strong>"" is a performance series that intends to provide inspiration, space, and audiences for Midwestern APA playwrights, directors, and actors. There will be four staged readings in 2018: February 12, and August 13 at Goodman Theatre, and May 21 and November TBA at Steppenwolf Theatre. The May reading will be marketed as part of Chicago’s <a href=""https://www.chipublib.org/news/celebrate-asian-american-and-pacific-islander-heritage-month-2/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">APA Heritage Month</a> activities. The August reading will possibly be included in the <a href=""http://caata.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Consortium of Asian American Theaters &amp; Artists</a> national conference. Admission to the staged play readings is free.</p>
<p>Series curator Mia Park is a Korean American actress and playwright working in Chicago for almost twenty years. As Guest Curator in the Arts Incubator program of the non-profit organization, <a href=""http://airmw.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Asian Improv aRts Midwest </a>(AIRMW)'s AA Arts Incubator, Mia believes that our universal voice is best developed by hearing local voices. Chicago’s theatre community is a microcosm of our global theatre’s lack of APA opportunities and AIRMW is dedicated to providing more of these opportunities.</p>

<h3>Your Impact: Curator's Statement from Mia Park</h3>
<p>Time Magazine’s <a href=""http://time.com/4992021/asian-americans-pacific-islanders-representation/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">recent article</a> on the lack of Asian American representation on television confirms what we already know: the Asian Pacific American (APA) population is seriously under represented. The same can be said for APA under representation in the oldest form of public story sharing, the theatrical stage. NBC News <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/asian-americans-theater-speak-out-myyellowfacestory-n566031"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">reported on</a> Asian Americans in theatre speaking out against the white-washing of Asian roles in entertainment and the challenges the APA community faces in the acting industry. </p>
<p>Chicago’s theatre community is a microcosm of our global theatre’s lack of APA opportunities. As a Chicago based Korean American actress and playwright for almost twenty years, I’ve experienced directly how, locally, our APA voices are often unheard in plays and on-screen. Since 2016, I’ve advocated for the training of local Asian American actors by hosting workshops in order to promote a qualified talent pool for casting directors to choose from, so that the explanation of “Chicago doesn’t have talented APA actors” can no longer apply. </p>
<p>I recognize that an important way to continue advocating for APA representation is to encourage the creation of content created by the APA community. I intend to provide inspiration, space, and an audience for local Asian American playwrights, directors, and actors in the series, ""<strong>Our Perspective: Asian American Play Readings</strong>"".</p>
<p>There will be four staged readings in 2018: February 12, and August 13 at Goodman Theatre, and May 21 and November TBA at Steppenwolf Theatre. The May reading will be marketed as part of Chicago’s <a href=""https://www.chipublib.org/news/celebrate-asian-american-and-pacific-islander-heritage-month-2/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">APA Heritage Month</a> activities.

<p>I believe that our universal voice will be best developed and strengthened by focusing on local talent. The only way to be heard and seen is to speak up and have presence, and ""<strong>Our Perspective: Asian American Play Readings</strong>"" aims to accomplish these goals. </p>

<h3>What's In The Way?</h3>
<p>The main obstacle in the way of this staged reading series succeeding is apathy. What if no one wants to hear APA voices onstage? What if this is not important enough to donate money towards? What if no one cares?<br/><br/>If we don't reach our $4,000 goal, the playwrights, actors and directors won't get paid and as professionals, they should be. To pay APA theatre artists as professionals, we need your help since admission to the readings is free.
