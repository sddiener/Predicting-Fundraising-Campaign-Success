<p>For almost 8 years the <a href=""www.athleticplayground.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Athletic Playground</a> has provided a happy home for playful movement practices of all kinds. Acrobats, aerialists, acroyogis, dancers, traceurs and traceuses, jugglers, and more have found not only a space to train and play, but also a vibrant and supportive community. </p>
<p>While our community is thriving, the quality and quantity of aerial equipment at Athletic Playground hasn’t kept pace with the aerialists themselves! For example, we’re ready to offer classes in straps and rope, but can’t do so until we get our hands on some straps and ropes. Our aluminum swivels are nearing the end of their lifespans, and we want to replace them with steel swivels, which last longer and rarely need to be replaced. We also want to provide our aerial silks students with some new fabrics, and finally, so that the quality of our trapezes can match the quality of our trapeze instructors and students, we need to do some re-roping and put new elbows on our trapezes.</p>
<p>With your support, we will provide our students and teachers with equipment as high-flying, diverse, and durable as they are. Our aerialists play hard and deserve gear to match their gumption. Thank you for your donation-hope to see you in the air!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Where the $ goes!</h3>
<p>We’re aiming high to both upgrade our current equipment and buy new types of 
equipment (ropes, lyra, straps) to expand our program and offer new 
classes. We realize that this is a LOFTY objective and it might seem hard to SWING it, but with your help we can BEAT our goal! We’ve prioritized our aerial needs based on vitality, and we’ll acquire the gear sequentially as we reach the following dollar amounts:<br/></p>
<p>1. 17 steel swivels - $1,205 (total $1,205 raised)<br/></p>
<p>2. Re-roping trapezes - $530 (total $1,735 raised)<br/></p>
<p>3. 4 straps - $2,640 (total $4,375 raised)<br/></p>
<p>4. 4 ropes - $1,760 (total $6,135 raised)<br/></p>
<p>5. 4 fabrics  - $524 (total $6,659 raised)<br/></p>

You will get GPS coordinates & a photo of the general area of the hiding spot. So, in this sense, yes, it's a lot like geocaching, but it's your treasure to keep (which you can't do with geocaching).
  Risk & Intrigue  What if someone else finds your treasure first?  
I will include a personalized slip in the container stating that it is meant for a specific person (you) and asking the unintended finder to leave the treasure as they found it. So yes, we will both need faith in humanity.
 
What if you can't find it?

I will try my darnedest to make the container as airtight as possible, so that it can sit in its spot safely for a good long time. If you're going nuts because you really can't find it, simply contact me, and I'll give you more specific directions.
What if the treasure is really seriously gone?

We'll talk about it and figure out together what would be a manageable and fair consolation treasure.
  Spread the Love Do you know someone who lives in one of the cities listed above? Tell them about this project!

 My name is Chris Komer. I'm a freelance musician in New York City, 
and also the founder and director of the Artists' Refuge at Thunderhead 
in Montana. Thunderhead is located near Hughesville, Montana which is so small it is not on most maps.   Hughesville is an historic  mining town that is surrounded by the 
Lewis and Clark National Forest in the Little Belt Mountains. It's about an hour and a half southeast of Great 
Falls, Montana. I founded the project in 2007, in hopes of creating a 
place where artists of all types can gather to build a community, 
collaborate, and rejuvenate in the mountains. So far we've had over 100 artists come through, and among those were musicians, painters, 
builders, a yoga master, actors, dancers, etc. What is truly special about
 Thunderhead is that WE the artists and creatives that have gotten involved are building it ourselves using 
alternative building methods and the resources available on our 
60-acres. For those that get involved with our project, a 
typical day may be spent building, clearing trails, hiking, fishing, drawing, recreating with a game of whiffle ball or horseshoes, playing 
music around a campfire and counting shooting stars. <br/><br/>
Currently on our land, we have a beautiful cordwood cabin with a living roof (a roof with 6 inches of dirt and grass and plants and flowers growing on top), a cordwood shower 
house, a camper trailer, a mobile home a small storage barn, and lots of wide open space. Our
 next project is to build a 2-storey round cordwood structure to be used
 as a commons, where people can gather, cook in the communal kitchen, 
make art, play music, and do all sorts of activities. </p><p>AND THIS IS WHAT WE NEED YOUR HELP WITH</p><p>A commons will be instrumental in taking Thunderhead to the next level.  Although Thunderhead is only open in the summertime right now a commons will help us begin the journey to making Thunderhead a year-round operation.</p><p>
<br/>
We are planning on doing it in 3 stages, and this summer, we're hoping 
to raise enough money to put in the foundation for the structure and to 
buy a portable sawmill, so we can begin milling structural timbers from 
some of our 30-acres of lodgepole pine trees. All of this will cost us about 
$17,000 which includes some funds for operating expenses for this summer. This project really needs your support right now, so 
Thunderhead can continue to grow and allow more people to enjoy our 
budding community - a community that you're invited to become a part of 
as well.  <br/><br/>
So this is how you can help:<br/>
Artist friends of Thunderhead have generously donated some wonderful 
paintings, drawings, sculptures, and mixed media art pieces; and some of
 our musician friends have donated tracks and albums of their music to 
help the project; including a compilation album of a number of 
musicians.  We also are offering some gorgeous log bed frames and some really neat all natural wood guitar and mandolin stands as well as a short stay in our adorable cordwood cabin.<br/><br/>
If you donate in any amount, you immediately become part of our 
community, and we will keep you up to date on all the latest Thunderhead news (if you like) and you can also get some cool stuff made by some of our 
Thunderhead artists.<br/><br/>
We'd really appreciate your support for this project, and we need your 
help to spread the word as well. Tell your friends and family about it, 
'like' our Facebook page, or simply come out this summer and check it 
out for yourself!<br/><br/>

 My name is Chris Komer. I'm a freelance musician in New York City, 
and also the founder and director of the Artists' Refuge at Thunderhead 
in Montana. Thunderhead is located near Hughesville, Montana which is so small it is not on most maps.   Hughesville is an historic  mining town that is surrounded by the 
Lewis and Clark National Forest in the Little Belt Mountains. It's about an hour and a half southeast of Great 
Falls, Montana. I founded the project in 2007, in hopes of creating a 
place where artists of all types can gather to build a community, 
collaborate, and rejuvenate in the mountains. So far we've had over 100 artists come through, and among those were musicians, painters, 
builders, a yoga master, actors, dancers, etc. What is truly special about
 Thunderhead is that WE the artists and creatives that have gotten involved are building it ourselves using 
alternative building methods and the resources available on our 
60-acres. For those that get involved with our project, a 
typical day may be spent building, clearing trails, hiking, fishing, drawing, recreating with a game of whiffle ball or horseshoes, playing 
music around a campfire and counting shooting stars. 
Currently on our land, we have a beautiful cordwood cabin with a living roof (a roof with 6 inches of dirt and grass and plants and flowers growing on top), a cordwood shower 
house, a camper trailer, a mobile home a small storage barn, and lots of wide open space. Our
 next project is to build a 2-storey round cordwood structure to be used
 as a commons, where people can gather, cook in the communal kitchen, 
make art, play music, and do all sorts of activities. AND THIS IS WHAT WE NEED YOUR HELP WITHA commons will be instrumental in taking Thunderhead to the next level.  Although Thunderhead is only open in the summertime right now a commons will help us begin the journey to making Thunderhead a year-round operation.

We are planning on doing it in 3 stages, and this summer, we're hoping 
to raise enough money to put in the foundation for the structure and to 
buy a portable sawmill, so we can begin milling structural timbers from 
some of our 30-acres of lodgepole pine trees. All of this will cost us about 
$17,000 which includes some funds for operating expenses for this summer. This project really needs your support right now, so 
Thunderhead can continue to grow and allow more people to enjoy our 
budding community - a community that you're invited to become a part of 
as well.  
So this is how you can help:
Artist friends of Thunderhead have generously donated some wonderful 
paintings, drawings, sculptures, and mixed media art pieces; and some of
 our musician friends have donated tracks and albums of their music to 
help the project; including a compilation album of a number of 
musicians.  We also are offering some gorgeous log bed frames and some really neat all natural wood guitar and mandolin stands as well as a short stay in our adorable cordwood cabin.
If you donate in any amount, you immediately become part of our 
community, and we will keep you up to date on all the latest Thunderhead news (if you like) and you can also get some cool stuff made by some of our 
Thunderhead artists.
We'd really appreciate your support for this project, and we need your 
help to spread the word as well. Tell your friends and family about it, 
'like' our Facebook page, or simply come out this summer and check it 
out for yourself!

<p>Sanctuary is a gift to the community, to allow festival goers an opportunity to connect, commune and experience inspiration in a tranquil environment. In 2011 our project was inspired by peaceful eastern traditions,  in 2012 we commemorated the end of the Mayan calendar, and in 2013 we are focusing on Nature's Elements: Earth, Fire, Wind and Water. </p>
<h3> 2013 Elements - Earth, Fire, Wind &amp; Water</h3>
<p>This interactive art installation will include the following exhibits: a Sacred Spiral Zen Garden, a Flaming cauldron and nightly Fire performances,  a Wind Vortex, and a circular Fountain. There will be communal seating around each installation, and daily workshops on mindfulness &amp; meditation.</p>

<p><span>108 girls need your help! </span></p>
<p>Help to raise just $34 per girl. That's enough for all the supplies for each girl for a whole year.</p>
<p>Our program opens hearts and minds with multimedia and arts education while teaching kids great skills they can use every day. </p>
<h3><strong><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">We are overwhelmed here with applications for new students and even offers of volunteer help, but we need your help to purchase the supplies we need. </span></strong></h3>
<div>
<span>Your contributions will be used to purchase:</span>
<ul>
<li><span>6 shared computers and monitors</span></li>
<li><span>Student desks and chairs</span></li>
<li><span>Art supplies</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>The girls really need your help. They want to learn, and they need supplies to get started.</span></p>
<h2>Matching Grant</h2>
<p>An anonymous donor has given us just 10 days to raise our first $2500 for a matching grant. Please contribute now and help us enroll our new students!</p>
<h3><span>Lasting Value</span></h3>
<span>Student projects in the past have included articles about local heritage and culture, cookbooks with recipes for traditional foods, maps of the local area and so much more. Students spend time learning in class sessions, working together on the computer, and also out in the community sharing their projects and helping to make it a better place for everyone with their new skills.</span>

<h3><span>About the Program and the Place</span></h3>
<p><span>The program serves disadvantaged girls ages 15 and up. 2/3 of Indonesian children don't finish 9th grade, and the majority of these dropouts are girls. Whereas children in developed countries are alloted upwards of $1,000 a year to cover the costs of schooling Indonesia only allots $100 per year. This isn't enough to cover the costs of schooling, and so additional fees are levied directly on students and their families. Inability to pay the fees is the number one reason that kids are dropping out. 87% of those who drop out enter the workforce.</span></p>
<p><span>This program is a mix of arts based education and community development. By creating a low (no) cost, enjoyable program students and families can stay involved and follow through. Graduates can find better employment due to  skills learned, and the cycle of poverty is interrupted. The community projects and works of art produced provide a lasting benefit to the local community long after the students have finished the program.</span></p>
<p><span>Families in Indonesia must often choose between a nutritious meal for their children or the price of a fueling up their motorcyle for a day of seeking employment. The minimum wage in our area is $160/month, but well over 60% of families in the area are barely surviving on less than $60 a month. Inflation is at 5.5% and rising. $2/day is not enough to feed a family of 4, and we haven't yet included the average $25/month/child fees levied by free public schools.</span></p>
<p><span>This project is developed and managed by the Local Routes Foundation of Bogor, Indonesia. We are a community Foundation, and your contributions help us to become a sustainable provider of solutions for poverty here in Indonesia. Your help today puts girls back in school. Please consider helping us to exceed our goal so that we can fully serve our community by expanding our activities to make the program fully self-sustaing.</span></p>

108 girls need your help! 
Help to raise just $34 per girl. That's enough for all the supplies for each girl for a whole year.
Our program opens hearts and minds with multimedia and arts education while teaching kids great skills they can use every day. 
We are overwhelmed here with applications for new students and even offers of volunteer help, but we need your help to purchase the supplies we need. 

Your contributions will be used to purchase:

6 shared computers and monitors
Student desks and chairs
Art supplies

The girls really need your help. They want to learn, and they need supplies to get started.
Matching Grant
An anonymous donor has given us just 10 days to raise our first $2500 for a matching grant. Please contribute now and help us enroll our new students!
Lasting Value
Student projects in the past have included articles about local heritage and culture, cookbooks with recipes for traditional foods, maps of the local area and so much more. Students spend time learning in class sessions, working together on the computer, and also out in the community sharing their projects and helping to make it a better place for everyone with their new skills.

From Us to You

When we reach our goal we want to share with you some of what the girls have been working on. These are items that the students have helped to create. You'll receive digital copies of them for your own enjoyment at home. You can print them!

About the Program and the Place
The program serves disadvantaged girls ages 15 and up. 2/3 of Indonesian children don't finish 9th grade, and the majority of these dropouts are girls. Whereas children in developed countries are alloted upwards of $1,000 a year to cover the costs of schooling Indonesia only allots $100 per year. This isn't enough to cover the costs of schooling, and so additional fees are levied directly on students and their families. Inability to pay the fees is the number one reason that kids are dropping out. 87% of those who drop out enter the workforce.
This program is a mix of arts based education and community development. By creating a low (no) cost, enjoyable program students and families can stay involved and follow through. Graduates can find better employment due to  skills learned, and the cycle of poverty is interrupted. The community projects and works of art produced provide a lasting benefit to the local community long after the students have finished the program.
Families in Indonesia must often choose between a nutritious meal for their children or the price of a fueling up their motorcyle for a day of seeking employment. The minimum wage in our area is $160/month, but well over 60% of families in the area are barely surviving on less than $60 a month. Inflation is at 5.5% and rising. $2/day is not enough to feed a family of 4, and we haven't yet included the average $25/month/child fees levied by free public schools.
This project is developed and managed by the Local Routes Foundation of Bogor, Indonesia. We are a community Foundation, and your contributions help us to become a sustainable provider of solutions for poverty here in Indonesia. Your help today puts girls back in school. Please consider helping us to exceed our goal so that we can fully serve our community by expanding our activities to make the program fully self-sustaing.

<p>Je suis Roberto D'Alessandro, cinéaste et artiste actif à Paris.</p>
<p>Le projet que je veux réaliser grâce à votre aide est une série de vidéos, resultat d'une <strong>recherche visuelle </strong>sur les<strong> paysages encore vierges de la Nouvelle Zélande</strong>. Je m’intéresse à la nature et à sa représentation au travers des moyens numériques. Mon travail prend souvent la forme de <strong>tableaux en mouvement</strong>.</p>
<p>Depuis le début de ma vocation artistique, le paysage a représenté un fort appel à ma sensibilité. J’ai grandi en Italie dans une petite ville aux pieds de l’Etna. Être si proche de ce volcan ne m'a jamais fait peur. Sa présence n'a jamais éveillé non plus la dévotion typique qu'ont tous les siciliens pour cette montagne. Pour moi l'Etna a toujours été une incroyable présence visuelle.</p>

<h3><strong>Méthode</strong></h3>
<p>Les expérimentations artistiques que j’ai menées dans les dernières années, m’ont démontré qu’il est possible de restaurer cette <strong>connexion originale intime avec le paysage</strong>. Le geste créateur lui-même a la fonction de rapprocher l’homme à la nature oubliée, au travers des observations répétées et l’attention à ses particularités. Grace à ces expérimentations, je connais mes outils et j’ai développé des méthodes d’observation et de production de vidéo-paysages. Dans chacun d’eux, la forme visuelle est directement influencée par le sujet. En d’autres termes, ce qui se passe devant l’objectif détermine la façon par laquelle le paysage est observé et traité dans l’œuvre. La forme d’un tableau mouvant rappelle la tradition du paysage tout au long de l’histoire de l’art.</p>

<p>La Nouvelle Zélande, avec sa richesse ancestrale, sa biodiversité et le caractère sauvage des deux tiers de son territoire, représente la destination privilégiée pour la suite de mon parcours et, en même temps, un défi, l’invitation à l’action sur le terrain et  la rupture de la routine.

<p>Durant la réalisation du projet, les populations locales indigènes, les Maoris, auront un rôle important: leur connaissance du territoire, des ses significations symboliques, les liens spirituels entre les communautés et leurs environnements, sont tous des éléments qui apporteront au projet une richesse culturelle indispensable.

<h3><strong>Organisation</strong></h3>
<p>Pour le déroulement et la réalisation du projet, je prévois une durée de <strong>six à douze mois</strong>, (à partir d’août 2013) qui incluent les déplacements, l’observation, l’exploration, la récolte de vidéos et de photos, ainsi que l’obtention d’une connaissance profonde des lieux avec lesquels sera entrepris un dialogue constructif, ce qui représente une étape indispensable afin de saisir la vérité intrinsèque de chaque paysage.</p>

<p>Le <strong>budget</strong> de 10000 euros indiqué réprésente un aide important pour la bonne réussite du projet et servira à couvrir partiellement les coûts de déplacement en territoire néozélandais (3000-4000 euros), l'achat de parties du matériel audiovisuel (notamment un objectif grand-angle, un téléobjectif et filtres adaptés à la captation de paysages, 3000-3500 euros), ainsi que l’organisation de la phase distribution/exposition de l'œuvre réalisée (affiches, location de locaux, installation d’écrans, etc., 3000-4000 euros).</p>
<h3><strong>Diffusion</strong></h3>
<p>A la fin de la période d’activité sur le terrain, l’œuvre réalisée (ou la série) sera présentée sous forme de <strong>projection et/ou d’installation d’écrans plats</strong>, en galléries d’art, mais aussi et surtout dans les espaces extérieurs de la ville (là où une collaboration avec les mairies sera possible), en Nouvelle Zélande, mais aussi en France et dans le reste de l’Europe.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I am a high school sophomore, and have been drawing since I can remember (that's my self-portrait at the top; I intend to post more drawings and paintings). The margins of my elementary and middle school notebooks are crammed with doodles and experiments, a testament to my perpetual desire to grow as an artist. When I attended Interlochen the summer after 8th grade (with the help of generous relatives and a little crowdsourcing), I saw my technical ability improve exponentially, along with my inspiration and dedication to art. Two years later, I want to go again. I received a small, merit-based scholarship for my portfolio, but it covers less than 13% of the money needed for tuition. <strong>We need extra support to make this possible.</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>
<p>The full tuition is $4,840. Subtracting the $650 merit scholarship still leaves $4,190. Ideally, I would need to raise at least $3,000 to make ends meet. Nevertheless, I cannot stress enough how much even the smallest donation helps. Even if I don't reach my goal, your gift still counts. Meanwhile, I'm offering a few perks in return:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>For donations of $10</strong>, I'll send you a handwritten thank-you note.</li>
<li>
<strong>For donations of $30</strong>, I'll send you a handwritten thank-you sonnet.</li>
<li>
<strong>For donations of $50</strong>, I'll calligraph your name. You can choose the style. I'll send it to you on a 5x7 card.</li>
<li>It sounds weird, but <strong>for donations of $75</strong>, I'm offering to proofread any short document or essay. While I do art, I'm also an avid proofreader. Send me a document (up to six pages) and I'll send you a typed, bulleted report on it. If you want, I'll include suggestions on the content and organization as well.</li>
<li>
<strong>For donations of $150</strong>, I'll proofread a large document (up to 20 pages).</li>
<li>
<strong>For donations of $500</strong>, I'll send you a <em>really big thank-you sonnet</em>. By this I mean a framed, hand-calligraphed, 18x24 sonnet thanking you for your donation.</li>
<li>
<strong>For a donation of $1,000</strong>, I'll paint your portrait from a photograph. Because I put a lot of effort into painting, I'll only offer this once. Send me three photos, and I'll paint from one of them.</li>

We (Barbara and Adriana) have been invited to participate in the Studio Monitor Artist Residency Program at Santa Reparata International School of Art in Florence, Italy. This residency will take place May through December of this year.  This amazing opportunity will allow us to focus on and investigate our visual concepts while immersing ourselves in all things Florence! Together! The program will give us full access to the studios which hosts state of the art printmaking, photography, book binding, fashion design, painting and drawing facilities. Near the end of our residency we will present an Artist in Residency Exhibition of completed work while at Santa Reparata. We will be financially responsible for all of our living, traveling and supply needs.  This is where this  campaign will help to get us to Italy.<br/></p>

</div></div>","Studio Monitor Artist Residencies: Hello Everyone! We have some very exciting news to share with you all. We (Barbara and Adriana) have been invited to participate in the Studio Monitor Artist Residency Program at Santa Reparata International School of Art in Florence, Italy. This residency will take place May through December of this year.  This amazing opportunity will allow us to focus on and investigate our visual concepts while immersing ourselves in all things Florence! Together! The program will give us full access to the studios which hosts state of the art printmaking, photography, book binding, fashion design, painting and drawing facilities. Near the end of our residency we will present an Artist in Residency Exhibition of completed work while at Santa Reparata. We will be financially responsible for all of our living, traveling and supply needs.  This is where this  campaign will help to get us to Italy.


   What We Need & What You Get:
We have been organizing and planning this trip for many months and saving up every penny we earn from our daily jobs. 100% of all donations will go to these necessities.This campaign will help us pay for :


Our housing. We will be in Florence for over 7 months. Rent, utilities and taxes.
Plane tickets to and from Italy.
And most importantly studio supplies. They include:  printmaking paper, dark room photography paper, film both printmaking and photography, drawing supplies, dark room supplies, inks, brushes, screen printing screens, adhesives, and any other supplies needed as we get working in the studios.

We have created some unique perks for different amounts of donations made. All of the perks, except for the personalized post cards, will be hand made pieces by us during our residency. With most of the perks you will receive something from both of us! We think they are pretty neat and hope to send you some fun stuff!

</div></div>","Hola!  
My name is KARI GALE and I am an illustrator and writer that loves telling stories with pictures and capturing the beauty of ordinary and extraordinary moments in my journal using pen and ink and watercolor. I recently published my first book of drawings called ""The Art of Walking: An Illustrated Journey on the Camino de Santiago"" in which I documented each day of my 500 mile journey in Spain resulting in over forty watercolor illustrations. 





This past September, I left the safety of the corporate world to pursue my lifelong dream of working as an illustrator and writer. I decided to take a year and delve into the two things I love the most: drawing and traveling! As I travel through Europe I have continued to document my experiences weekly in word and image on my blog at karigale.com.

<b>Why Brilliant is so brilliant :</b>
</h4>
<p><b>Brilliant</b> is a <b>playful</b>, <b>modern</b>, <b>timeless</b> and <b>educational</b> photography art book for children that INSPIRES kids to engage their observation skills and imaginations.<br/>
</p>
<p>Brilliant is a unique blend of mixed genres combining 
documentary-street style photography with fantasy illustration blurring 
the boundaries between the real and imaginary worlds in a way that is 
totally natural for children. This makes learning a fun and positive 
experience. <br/></p>
<p>The book maintains an organic, 'hand-made' feel throughout. Everything
 was created MANUALLY without any use of computer programs, the photographs were shot on film, enlarged, then printed before being painted onto by hand. This has created a refreshing contrast to all the 3D and 
computer animated media which can sometimes feel a bit distant to the viewer.</p>

We just have to drop them off at our London based printers!<br/>Good quality lithographic printing isn't cheap. The book will be fairly large, which will be more enjoyable to kids' eyes and easier for them to draw and paint in. <br/><br/>Our ultimate goal is to have 500 copies made, which will cost £5000 but with your help to reach £2500, (and possibly more), we will be well on our way to completion.<br/>Obviously, the more support we get, the 
better our chances are to lift it off the 
ground sooner and eventually onto the shelves of all good book stores for a wider public. <br/><br/>

<p>Costs breakdown: <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Printing 500 copies , 36 pages full-colour : £5000 </p>
<p>Packaging : £200 </p>
<p>Additional posters and stickers : £200 </p>Crowd-funding fee  : approx. £200<br/><br/>Backers will receive the final product in the post as soon as the books come back from the printers.<br/>We also offer some extra treats, like posters showing images from the book as well as stickers.

</div> <div> <p><b>Why the project is so valuable :</b></p>
<p>There isn't a book like Brilliant out there. We felt that traditional educational children's books explaining colours are not as vibrant and exciting as ours as Brilliant also contains photographs showing characters out of real life. 95% of books for children only contain illustration. To include photographs makes a connection to daily life scenery which especially the young viewer can relate to. We wanted to create something that broke the mould of the books already available and inject a new spark of life and chaotic fun to an area of learning that could be full of possibilities.<br/>The world we have created is inclusive of the audience and invites children and parents alike to dive in and join all the characters in a fun and original way.<br/></p>
<p>Our simple goal is to bring a positive and unlimited sense of fun and imagination into learning for young children, with the aim to communicate the idea that anything can happen in the pages of our book and also in the world outside of it. Our work is always vibrant and chaotic but in a positive and charming way. <br/><br/></p>
<p></p>Both <a href=""http://unpatient.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Judith</a> and <a href=""http://paulbower.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Paul</a> have successful careers as artists individually. Judith as a photographer working for magazines, in publishing and on book projects.<br/>Paul's illustration work covers editorial, advertising, theatre, children's furnishings and book covers ( incl winning best book cover award at the V&amp; A Museum ).<br/>Together they have worked successfully as a team on many projects and felt that the time was right to put all this creativity towards something they feel is an important and positive influence.

This will help to get the project off the ground and much closer to our aim of a fully printed book.After two years of work, all the artwork is completed, and all 36 pages are waiting to go to print. We just have to drop them off at our London based printers!Good quality lithographic printing isn't cheap. The book will be fairly large, which will be more enjoyable to kids' eyes and easier for them to draw and paint in. Our ultimate goal is to have 500 copies made, which will cost £5000 but with your help to reach £2500, (and possibly more), we will be well on our way to completion.Obviously, the more support we get, the 
better our chances are to lift it off the 
ground sooner and eventually onto the shelves of all good book stores for a wider public. 
   WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET : 
Costs breakdown: 

Printing 500 copies , 36 pages full-colour : £5000 
Packaging : £200 
Additional posters and stickers : £200 Crowd-funding fee  : approx. £200Backers will receive the final product in the post as soon as the books come back from the printers.We also offer some extra treats, like posters showing images from the book as well as stickers. Have a look at our different awards that are listed on this page.
  Why the project is so valuable :
There isn't a book like Brilliant out there. We felt that traditional educational children's books explaining colours are not as vibrant and exciting as ours as Brilliant also contains photographs showing characters out of real life. 95% of books for children only contain illustration. To include photographs makes a connection to daily life scenery which especially the young viewer can relate to. We wanted to create something that broke the mould of the books already available and inject a new spark of life and chaotic fun to an area of learning that could be full of possibilities.The world we have created is inclusive of the audience and invites children and parents alike to dive in and join all the characters in a fun and original way.
Our simple goal is to bring a positive and unlimited sense of fun and imagination into learning for young children, with the aim to communicate the idea that anything can happen in the pages of our book and also in the world outside of it. Our work is always vibrant and chaotic but in a positive and charming way. 
Both Judith and Paul have successful careers as artists individually. Judith as a photographer working for magazines, in publishing and on book projects.Paul's illustration work covers editorial, advertising, theatre, children's furnishings and book covers ( incl winning best book cover award at the V& A Museum ).Together they have worked successfully as a team on many projects and felt that the time was right to put all this creativity towards something they feel is an important and positive influence.
  


 
Are there any risks :Everything is very straightforward. The content has already been created and is ready to go to print. Test prints have been done on our paper of choice. We will be using excellent and experienced London-based printers we have worked with before.

In the Spring of 2014 while attending the Vytacil Artist Residency in upstate New York, Emma submitted an application to a residency in Seyðisfjörður, Iceland.        H E I M A is a collective of individuals coming together to support the practice of art and build a community of artists looking to work together as well as separately. Provided with a studio and living quarters, she has been given the opportunity to stay on campus, focus on her studio practice and build a new portfolio. 


Emma has been studying and making work since her youth as a homeschooled student and has perpetuated her career as an artist by receiving her BFA from the University of Minnesota, as well as studying realism in Florence, Italy.  She has recently returned from her degree in Italy and now is emerged in a full time studio practice at her Minneapolis studio.

Subsidizing her work in Minneapolis, with residency programs, Emma has attended and been invited to over a dozen residencies world wide. H E I M A has been one of her preferred programs  and will begin 2015.

                                                __________________________
H E I M A meaning 'home' could be my home for upwards of a year.  Upon acceptance I have been allotted a position at the residency for a year and am encouraged to come and go, or stay for the full year.  A newly established program of young adults, H E I M A is a multidisciplinary collective for emerging and established artists and is a place where I can study as a post graduate.

                           

        

*LOWER PEICES ARE DENSITE PANELS- New works by Emma made on substrate similar to plaster. 

With help, Emma will be able to build a new body of work so as to further her career in art making and give her practice the time that it needs to grow. H E I M A is a place where all this can be done and at a fraction of the cost of living and working at home.  


H E I M A is an affiliate of the LungA school also in Seyðisfjörður, Iceland. The individuals participating in the development of H E I M A have also simultaneously opened a school for the arts.  Looking to assist all artists within their specific pre or post education practices. Emma will be able to work along side and participate in discussions and development of the LungA school,  a new school for undergraduate artists.

                                                 __________________________                                      ALL IN ORDER

                        In anticipation for the program Emma is fundraising!
Travel, artist supplies and a low cost of living, as well as the purchase of a key for the completion of the membership.   Emma intends to leave early June, 2015 - November, 2015, and stay 6 months out of the 12 available.  The purchase of her flight and supplies at $500, as well as the payment of  12.000 DDK or $2000 to the H E I M A program.
                      This key will act act as rent cost for the 6 months of stay.
                                  Averging to a little over €250 a month.

When the Burning Man 2013 theme, Cargo Cult, was announced, it really sparked a creative fire.  The relation of the cults to superior technology, appearing as if magic, carries a certain appeal that mimics what we do in the desert.  The inclusion of our 21st century culture, our Burner culture, as a new and savvy cargo cult awaiting to be delivered from destruction via as-yet-unseen technology inspired a flood of project ideas for the playa.
When the opportunity arose to create a Minnesota C.O.R.E. project, one story of gifts from an advanced alien culture jumped forth: The Day The Earth Stood Still.
In the 1956 film, an alien culture attempts to warn mankind to not continue down the path toward atomic annihilation.  Through ignorance and xenophobia humankind almost destroys itself by imprisoning the messenger.  The allegory was brought forward to a contemporary B-Movie remake, with environmental catastrophe replacing nuclear weapons as the antagonist.  Is the ultimate gift protecting ourselves from our own technology?  Learning that lesson would benefit everyone.

<h3>About our Campaign</h3>
<p>During the stay at home orders due to Covid-19, we have been working hard to stay connected to our clients. Many small businesses are struggling, and many artists are itching to get back to work, and we are no different. We have had many people ask how they can be supportive while we are not working, and we did not want to ask for help without being able to offer anything in return to those contributing to our business. Any little bit helps, from small packages to large. This will be one of the few times aside from the holidays that we sell discounted gift certificates, so act now - especially if you have an upcoming appointment when we return!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have a loose goal of $2,000. We have applied for small business relief loans, but at this time we have not heard anything back. We are doing okay, and artists are still able to get paid during the time off due to savings we had built, but all the help from our supporters will help that stretch a little further. When we reopen, we hope to be in a good place to where we are not stretched too thin. With your contribution, you can select any of the following perks:</p>
<ul>
<li>T-Shirts</li>
<li>Prints</li>
<li>Jewelry discounts</li>
<li>Free Piercings</li>
<li>Discounted Gift Certificates</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What will your contribution support?</h3>
<p>Every amount we raise will continue going to financial support to pay artists while on leave, stay current on rent and bills, and help us re-stock when we prepare to reopen. Part of the contributions will raise funds to pay for the perk items we will be providing, which will be available for in person pick up only at the studio once we reopen and orders have been fulfilled.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges for our campaign</h3>
<p>This has been a difficult time for many of us. We know that the uncertainty of the next year or two may provide a lot of unexpected hurdles. We are doing our best to prepare for those now. We hope that through all of this, we can stick together and continue offering services even from a distance. </p>
<p>*Due to the shut down of many businesses, and the uncertainty of shipping costs and production times, we are currently unable to offer shipping options. Additionally, when we reopen there will be a period of time where we will be working around the clock to contact all appointments and put things back together, and sending packages will not be feasible. We will make announcements for when the products will be available, and we will have them ready for pickup after that time. For anyone purchasing gift certificates or discount perks, those will be available immediately following the end of this campaign.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please share this campaign with your friends, or ban together to buy a bulk package with a few buddies. Thank you again for all of your help and support during this time!</p>

<p>A social network for robots? Yes, you are reading that correctly.<br/><br/>A little about myself: My name is Merlijn. I make interactive projects and installations using tools like Processing and Arduino.</p>
<p>So what is an apparat? An apparat can be a simple robot, a complex one, a website, or an interactive installation: any device or program that uses a form of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>Creature Apparat</strong> is a social network for these apparats. It aims to increase the complexity of your apparat's artificial intelligence through building connections with other people's apparats. It will:</p>
<ul>
<li>shape the interactions of your creation with other apparats.</li>
<li>help your apparat make friends and communicate with them.</li>
</ul><p>Many projects are using artificial intelligence in isolation. If there is any exterior input at all, it is a datastream form the web. Creature Apparat has a different approach. We focus on the social interactions between apparats in order to create a more complex and organic artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>The first version of this project was only accessible to me. Now I want to open up this project to everyone. In order to do this, I need funding for the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The project website, which will be user friendly, fast, secure and accessible.</li>
<li>An API for developers, with documented code and examples for the most current platforms.</li>
</ul><p>With your help we can start up this social network for robots, websites and digital creatures of all kinds. The future possibilities of this project are endless, but not without your support!</p>
<h2>This is what you get</h2>
<p>The system will eventually be open for anyone, but for starters it will be limited to those who support Creature Apparat, whether financially or by helping with the actual coding and system development. What's in it for you?</p>
<ul>
<li>You'll get a number of API Keys so you can start to connect your apparat.</li>
<li>One lucky person can get a working version of my own prototype of <em>Creature Alpha</em> to connect to the system.</li>
</ul><p>Funding will go to good and fast hosting, including a private IP and an SSL certificate. We need these to guarantee speed (hosting) and security (private ip, ssl). The remainder of the funding will go to the expansion of the project, the site, and the API.</p>
<h2>How can I get involved?</h2>
<p>With your help we'll be able get this project started! Can't help financially? Don't worry, there's a lot of other help we could use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spread the word, on human networks such as Twitter, Facebook or Pinterest</li>
<li>If you are a web developer you can help me code.</li>
<li>If you are an apparat developer you can share your thoughts and ideas. Let me know what <strong>Creature Apparat</strong> would be for you!</li>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>I'm a professional artist, writer and comic creator with over a decade of experience. As is well known in the creative arts world, from time-to-time things get tight financially. I have an exhibition of my artwork opening on March 31st and running until May 4th. And I'm short a few frames. As you may know, frames are expensive. Also some art needs to be reproduced and printed digitally for display. Times are tight and help is appreciated. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is my first ever real art exhibition of my work. A collection of pop, surreal, realistic, and comic art that spans a decade and crosses multiple boundaries of style and genre. As I said, this is my first legitimate exhibition and it is an important step to help me pursue my passion as a career that I can make a living on. My work has been steadily gaining more and more national media attention for the last year and this exhibit will be a key step in continuing that trend.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>On the opening night of April 1st at 7pm there will also be a meet and great with the me, (the artist) and I'll be signing copies of my various comic books. 50% of profits from issue sales will be donated to the Hamilton Salvation Army.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need frames and limited digital prints, and your help meeting the expenses associated with that will be rewarded with my undying love and admiration as well as a donor thank you listing online and displayed at the exhibition, as well as the many perks listed to the right based on the level of financial help you can offer.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>This would be a great event for any business, publisher, tv station, newspaper or radio station to sponsor! We would also give you signage at the exhibit!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>My name is Brett Budzinski. I'm a drawer, printmaker, and painter based out of Philadelphia, Pa. I received my BFA and BA from Drake University in Des Moines, IA. This campaign is for the production of a coloring book of original drawings by me! This campaign is important to me because I want to be able to share my drawings with more people at a more attainable scale. My artwork focuses on relationships we all have with each other and having people from all over coloring and interacting with my drawings is what this book is all about. With backing this campaign you'll be helping me to cover productions costs so that I can get the books mailed out to you with your backing!</p>

</h3>
<div><span style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;"">With your backing, I'll be using the funds to pay for the production of the coloring books. All the books will be <b>Spiral Bound,</b> so that you can color them in, flat on a table, all printed on high-quality paper so that you can use a variety of mediums; colored pencil, pen, marker, paint, whatever you want! They will also be one sided so that if your marker bleeds it doesn't affect the drawing on the back! </span></div>
<div><span style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;"">Some of the perks that come along with backing this campaign include a signed and numbered book with any donation over $15. If you donate over $25 you'll get a signed small drawing. Any donation over $50 gets a signed large drawing.</span></div>
<div>My goal for this project is $500 and that will go towards the printing of the books along with the supplies needed to create the original drawings. The additional funds will be used to help offset the cost of Graduate School admissions costs as well as entries to exhibitions and shows so that I can continue to display my artwork.</div>

<p>Hi my name is Kitty Gallanis of MissFitPhoto.com and here is my story.</p>
<p>As any young artist we all grow up having a dream of our
work being in a museum...well i have a
chance to make mine come true.  I
currently work the Bookshop at the Getty Villa in Malibu and have a chance
to have some work hang at the Getty Center during the Getty Underground event
in the summer.  Now this is a private
event that gives people like me, that work for the Getty, a chance to show our
work to people in the art community, a chance i would never normally have. </p>
<p>I have been creating art
since i was a little girl and studding it for just as long. I have put all of
my blood and sweat and tears and frustrations and every dime i have in to my
work...like all artists do. I have painted and sculpted and drawn myself into a
tizzy most of my life, but have found my love for this world through my camera
lens. Though i have strived to make my photography and art work the only job i
have it hasn't happened yet. I still
struggle to pay bills and scrape pennies together to try and get projects off
the ground. they don't call us starving artists for nothing lol I have been a
photographer for almost 10 years now and because it is my passion i do shoots
for free or discount the hell out of the price because i know people are
struggling as much as i am. but my photography is my art and my art is my
life...and it ain't cheap. </p>
<p>In 2012 i was laid off from a job, as most people were in
this hard economy. I struggled to broaden my photography and try and make it
work as a full time job, but to no avail, in these times it wasn't possible. Luckily in 2013 i got a part time job at the
Getty Villa Book Store  (Hooray!!!) a job
at a place i had wanted to work at since i was a little girl. Who gets to say
that? not many people, but i do :)  one
of the perks for working at the Getty Villa is you, as an artist, get a chance
to participate in the Getty Underground . this is a private event for getty
staff and volunteers to show that they
are just as talented as the artist that hang in the Museum and for influential people in the art community to see our work. Now i have been given a space to show at this
event...one Piece...one grand piece that will show my creativity and what i can
do. The only problem is i cant afford to do it.</p>
<p>When i started my mixed media project it didnt seem like it would be to
much...Couple hundred for Canvas prints,
couple hundred for paints and textures and lets not forget the sealants and the
gold leafing and so on and so forth. Well months went by and from bills to food
and rent and oh dear god the cell phone bill and cant forget internet and blah
blah blah...you have these bills too so you get it :) anyways, every time i put a dime
away, i had something pop up that was a quarter and needless to say i dont have
anything saved. to much month at the end of my money. </p>
<p>So here i am, asking you for your help, any help will do. now
if by chance i dont reach my goal, it's not the end of the world, the
project  just won't be as grand and not
with as many good supplies...but i will do it, with your help. please remember all the times i have done free gigs or knocked
down prices so you could afford that shoot that you always wanted but were on a
tight budget and donate a buck. that's it
$1. And if your a fan of my work and have enjoyed all of the images i have done
through the years, donate $1....or more...lol just something to help. </p>
<p>so in closing, Please help me achieve my dream of hanging at
the Getty Center, you have no idea how much it would mean to me. By the way, i will be posting the finished photo of my project for all to see once it goes up in the summer of 2014 at the Getty Underground.</p><p>thank you,</p><p>Kitty Gallanis<br/></p><p></p></div>","Hi my name is Kitty Gallanis of MissFitPhoto.com and here is my story.

<p>The Mighty Fingers Facing Change is a global collaborative art project that is building stronger communities, locally and globally. Mighty Fingers Facing Change will travel to a minimum of 14 locations in six continents to create a giant community mural and a series of self portraits created by adolescent girls around the world. Together, we will use our fingers to paint this progressive mural, abstract portraits, and stronger communities! At each location we will work with a different group of girls and they will use their mighty fingers to add their indelible mark to the mural, sign their name to it, create their own self portrait art piece, and collaborate with their sisters around the world. We will do this with the assistance of numorous non-profit organizations that work to support women and girls day in and day out.</p>
<p>Our scheduled launch in NJ was interrupted by Hurricane Sandy, but the team headed to Guatemala as scheduled on November 11th. We began our journey working with the Association IDEI and their Child and Youth Parliament in Quetzaltenango. See images on our FB page &lt;<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/MightyFingersFacingChange"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.facebook.com/MightyFingersFacingChange</a>&gt; and a video here under the ""gallery"" tab. Jackson, WY is scheduled in January, followed by Edmonton, Canada, and Austin, TX... and many more. As we progress so will the FingerSmear mural. Supporters and participants will be able to watch the project and canvas as it unfolds. Follow our progress and hear the stories of girls around the world that participate. Video uploads and blog posts &lt;<a href=""http://kellysullivanfineart.com/blog"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://kellysullivanfineart.com/blog</a>&gt;  will keep you involved all the way until it's completion at our final location in September, 2013. In addition to the communities we will travel to, girls from all over the world will be able to participate by uploading their own self-portraits along with statements about what they will do for humanity with their ""Mighty Fingers"". By bringing girls together to paint and freely express themselves we will inspire collaboration and encourage them to achieve more with their mighty fingers. They will bring new vision and strength to their communities. We will share it all with you. Together, we will all create a better world - beautifully.</p>

<h2>With Our Mighty Fingers...</h2>
<p>My name is Kelly Sullivan. My art is communication, my focus is collaboration, and my drive is community - and it always has been. Mighty Fingers Facing Change is a career opus of sorts. It's something I have envisioned for nearly 20 years. I decided to try to build it, and I am humbled and greateful for the many individuals that encourged me when it was just a concept, and have supported it with time and talent as it grew. I am greatful for our growing list of partners around the world mentioned below, and it is my true honer to help support the work they do through the work that I do. Thier commitment to supply lodging and logistical support for our team in each location is invaluable.</p>
<p>The final stage of our preparation takes place right on this page with all of you! We need to raise funds to pay for airfare, ground transport, art supplies, video equipment, general production expenses, and small stipend for the team to keep the lights on here at home. We want to meet our goal, so that we can help girls around the world meet theirs. You will get to know them, and you will be happy that you did.</p>
<p><strong>Be moved by the power of WILL and the strength that is at your fingertips. You use your fingers to pledge, they will use their fingers to paint a better tomorrow. <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2>What We'll Create Together</h2>
<p><span>At each location on our trip we will execute a two-part program. During the first part we encourage and celebrate individuality as we help the girls create their own self-portraits using visualization exercises and acrylic paint. For the second part, we work together with the girls to design and paint a portion of the 10’ x 5’ Mighty Fingers global community FingerSmear mural.</span></p>

<h2><span>The FingerSmear Mural</span></h2>
<p><span><span>Our FingerSmear mural is a large collaborative piece of artwork created by thousands of people throughout the world. It is the unifying piece of our project, and it will tell a global story of community, collaboration and the world working together as one to create something beautiful. At each Mighty Fingers location we visit we will add to the mural. When our journey is complete, our mural will be the first-ever globally-created canvas made by the hands of girls all over the world. It will illustrate the passion and power of tomorrow's biggest change-makers. It will be Mighty. <br/></span></span></p>

They need to be reminded of the power they posses to change their world and secure a better future. We are there to help them access that power, understand the source of it, and use it.

Kelly has had over 80,000 people stick their fingers in paint at her request, all for the purpose of adding to the larger picture, literally and figuratively.  FingerSmears have raised over $150,000 for charities across the country. They have been commissioned to commemorate All Star Baseball and Basketball Games, The US Open, The 50th Anniversary of the United Nations, and The National Walk for Epilepsy on the Mall in Washington, DC. Being able to orchastrate and create these large paintings for the past 20 years has inspired a way of life for Kelly. This Mighty Fingers Facing Change project is the best way that she, as an artist, can elevate the state of the the world through its girls - and she is excited and humbled to do this work and support one of the most exciting shifts of her lifetime - the rise of adolecsent girls and women around the world. <br/></span></span></span></span></p>

<h2>Along the Way</h2>
<p>As we travel, teach and create, we will utilize numerous media avenues to extend our project to everyone around the world who wants to be a part of it. We will maintain a strong digital and social media presence that will enable anyone (not just the organizations and girls we visit and paint with) to participate in our purpose and show us what they can do with their mighty fingers. Girls will upload videos of themselves using their mighty fingers to create. They will become part of the process. They will communicate and unify right along with us.</p>
<p>We will also create video clips and uploads that follow our entire journey. The clips will capture the process of creating our global, larger-than-life Fingersmear mural and will capture how our project empowers young women and strengthens communities. The clips will also highlight the locations, organizations and girls that we work with.  And, even beyond that, it will spread and immortalize the message that young women can change the future.</p>

I call these large interactive paintings FingerSmears. I have been producing these collaborative works ever since. Over 80,000 people have stuck their fingers in paint under my direction, from rock starts to movie stars, from Fortune 500 CEOs to kindergarten kids, all of them working in the spirit of collaboration to add their mark and make a statement about the bigger picture.  I have always dreamed of creating a global FingerSmear and I am finally going to do it with Mighty Fingers Facing Change! I am so excited to support what I believe to be the most exciting shift of the 21st century: the empowerment of adolescent girls and the strengthening of our communities around the world.</p>

With Our Mighty Fingers...
My name is Kelly Sullivan. My art is communication, my focus is collaboration, and my drive is community - and it always has been. Mighty Fingers Facing Change is a career opus of sorts. It's something I have envisioned for nearly 20 years. I decided to try to build it, and I am humbled and greateful for the many individuals that encourged me when it was just a concept, and have supported it with time and talent as it grew. I am greatful for our growing list of partners around the world mentioned below, and it is my true honer to help support the work they do through the work that I do. Thier commitment to supply lodging and logistical support for our team in each location is invaluable.
The final stage of our preparation takes place right on this page with all of you! We need to raise funds to pay for airfare, ground transport, art supplies, video equipment, general production expenses, and small stipend for the team to keep the lights on here at home. We want to meet our goal, so that we can help girls around the world meet theirs. You will get to know them, and you will be happy that you did.
Be moved by the power of WILL and the strength that is at your fingertips. You use your fingers to pledge, they will use their fingers to paint a better tomorrow. 
 
What We'll Create Together
At each location on our trip we will execute a two-part program. During the first part we encourage and celebrate individuality as we help the girls create their own self-portraits using visualization exercises and acrylic paint. For the second part, we work together with the girls to design and paint a portion of the 10’ x 5’ Mighty Fingers global community FingerSmear mural.

 
The FingerSmear Mural
Our FingerSmear mural is a large collaborative piece of artwork created by thousands of people throughout the world. It is the unifying piece of our project, and it will tell a global story of community, collaboration and the world working together as one to create something beautiful. At each Mighty Fingers location we visit we will add to the mural. When our journey is complete, our mural will be the first-ever globally-created canvas made by the hands of girls all over the world. It will illustrate the passion and power of tomorrow's biggest change-makers. It will be Mighty. 

We Will Create

The first ever Global FingerSmear Painting Project
A collection of self-portraits of adolescent girls around the world -we will have a digital version - they get to keep their original piece of art.
Video uploads and clips of our Mighty Fingers journey, our artwork and our impact
Authentic artwork from our tour to give to all of YOU, our amazing Indiegogo supporters, as PERKS.
Please take part in our Mighty Fingers project in any way you can. Enthusiasm and support from many Mighty Fingers like yours will help us reach our $145,000 goal!
 
Where We Will Go and Who We Will Work With
We are planning to bring this project to locations around the world, and in each one we have partnered with a different organization. Hosting organizations that have commited to the project so far are Rutgers Unversity's Future Scholars Program,  IDEI and The Children and Youth Parliament of Guatemala, Girls Actively Participating (GAP!) , YWCA in Edmonton, Canada, GENaustin, Boys & Girls Clubs of San Francisco, The Bright Lights Communty Learning Initiative, The Society for Transformation of Women and Children in  Nigeria, the NZE - FEE Foundation in Uganda, Caring About Women and Children in China, and The State University of Surabaya in Indonesia.  We are working to develop partnerships with organizations in Russia, Poland, Italy, the UK, Israel, South Africa, Afghanistan, Chile, and Brazil. New developments happen everyday.
 

 
Helping Girls, Helping Communities
Adolescent girls are the largest underserved and at-risk population in the world, yet they are a huge part of our world’s progress and future. They need to be reminded of the power they posses to change their world and secure a better future. We are there to help them access that power, understand the source of it, and use it. They will be encouraged to make changes that will have a positive impact - not just for themselves, but for the communities they live in and the generations they effect throughout their lifetime. 
Mighty Fingers Facing Change is here to inspire the power we know exists. We are here to bring it to the surface and create a new way of seeing what lays the foundation for change. KNOWING and FEELING that you can make a difference is the very first step. Mighty Fingers Facing Change will enable girls to think creativley and critically, and express themselves freely through the honesty of art. That vision will help them grow, succeed and create stronger communities and a better future.
 
 
What is a FingerSmear?
""FingerSmears"" are large collaborative paintings created under my direction using the ""fingersmears"" of hundreds, sometimes thousands, of people on one canvas. Kelly has had over 80,000 people stick their fingers in paint at her request, all for the purpose of adding to the larger picture, literally and figuratively.  FingerSmears have raised over $150,000 for charities across the country. They have been commissioned to commemorate All Star Baseball and Basketball Games, The US Open, The 50th Anniversary of the United Nations, and The National Walk for Epilepsy on the Mall in Washington, DC. Being able to orchastrate and create these large paintings for the past 20 years has inspired a way of life for Kelly. This Mighty Fingers Facing Change project is the best way that she, as an artist, can elevate the state of the the world through its girls - and she is excited and humbled to do this work and support one of the most exciting shifts of her lifetime - the rise of adolecsent girls and women around the world. 

 
Along the Way
As we travel, teach and create, we will utilize numerous media avenues to extend our project to everyone around the world who wants to be a part of it. We will maintain a strong digital and social media presence that will enable anyone (not just the organizations and girls we visit and paint with) to participate in our purpose and show us what they can do with their mighty fingers. Girls will upload videos of themselves using their mighty fingers to create. They will become part of the process. They will communicate and unify right along with us.
We will also create video clips and uploads that follow our entire journey. The clips will capture the process of creating our global, larger-than-life Fingersmear mural and will capture how our project empowers young women and strengthens communities. The clips will also highlight the locations, organizations and girls that we work with.  And, even beyond that, it will spread and immortalize the message that young women can change the future.

Our Team
I'm Kelly Sullivan, and I developed FingerSmears almost 20 years ago. I call these large interactive paintings FingerSmears. I have been producing these collaborative works ever since. Over 80,000 people have stuck their fingers in paint under my direction, from rock starts to movie stars, from Fortune 500 CEOs to kindergarten kids, all of them working in the spirit of collaboration to add their mark and make a statement about the bigger picture.  I have always dreamed of creating a global FingerSmear and I am finally going to do it with Mighty Fingers Facing Change! I am so excited to support what I believe to be the most exciting shift of the 21st century: the empowerment of adolescent girls and the strengthening of our communities around the world.

Her honest connection with life and willingess to speak about it created a series of articles called ""Life in the Middle"" that won a first place award for a student columnist at the Idaho State Press Awards. She took a hiatus from the column to undergo a  spinal fusion for scoliosis. Over six months post-op, she is excited to continue her column as she travels with Mighty Fingers Facing Change. She will document the Mighty Fingers project through the eyes of a teenage girl as she learns firsthand the differences that set us apart and the similarities that bring us together.

<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I am looking to start up a web based store to sell handmade chainmail armor/jewelry/etc...</p>
<p>I am a medieval enthusiast who has always dreamt of making my own set of armor. When a friend showed me how it was done, I was in my glory. It truly is an awesome hobby and I would like to take it to the next level.</p>
<p>Whether you simply share this page with your friends, donate a dollar, or donate enough to recieve a perk I thank you for your help and support!</p>
<p><strong>Funds</strong></p>
<p>Any and all funds received will go towards the purchase and shipping of the materials needed to start up my store. Your average suit of armor can weigh up to 30 pounds and is made of approximately 30,000 metal rings that must be hand-crafted together. I’ve done my research and the cheapest and yet high quality metal rings sell for $200 for the supply needed for just one set of armor. Using these funds I can create enough pieces so that the profit I will make will be enough to keep the supplies coming in.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Not only will your contributions allow me to start up my own business, but you will provide me with the resources to continue in a hobby that truly is rewarding. Not only will you make me happy but my future customers will be as well. The reason chain mail armor is so expensive is not because of the material cost but the time involved in making it. I plan to offer quality pieces at prices that allow me to continue the business and that won’t break the bank.</p>
<p>Contributors will enjoy various perks as well. See the gallery for pictures of the perk prizes! Also anyone interested in bigger projects can stay in touch and when I get things rolling, I would not mind giving out some awesome discounts to people who truly deserve it!</p>

We want to raise enough funds to be able to pay for flights, accommodation and expenses of artists, venue hire, promotional materials, sound, visial equipment etc.
There is not enough places at the moment where artists from different counries and backgrounds can amaze you with what they do.
HEART will provide the opportunity for 10-15 artists of different type, to  come on stage and awe you. Every artist will be in a different category  of art - therefore you will see paintings around the room, have a chance to see live fire breathing, freakshow artists, singers, designers,  filmmakers and experience variety of art in one place.
Some of our performers include:


Nati Amos (fire performer - NYC) http://www.coneyisland.com/per.nati.shtml

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">The Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center (BMCM+AC) and the Media Arts Project (MAP) announce the 4th annual {Re}HAPPENING, on Saturday, April 6th from 6pm to Midnight in the original dining hall of the former Black Mountain College, now Camp Rockmont. Inspired by our imaginings about what a “typical” Saturday night at Black Mountain College might have been like, the {Re}HAPPENING pays tribute to the groundbreaking artistic innovation of Black Mountain College as well as its community tradition of Saturday night parties and performances. The goal of the event is to bring BMC’s dynamic energy into the present day.More info: <a href=""http://rehappening.com/?page_id=2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://rehappening.com/?page_id=2</a></p>
<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Described as a “winsome water nymph” by native resident, Mary Ford Miller, the Swannanoa River has graced the BMC campus with its focal point, Lake Eden, since before the inception of the college.  Without the constant influx of renewing waters the lake would not be worthy of its name.  The walking labyrinths has been used as a human gesture of affection toward the earth for centuries across many cultures.  As a ceremonial event, on the occasion of the 2013 {Re}Happening, we propose the construction of a ca. 30 foot diameter labyrinth, the location and orientation to be dowsed and the path-marking materials to be collected locally on the day of the event.  A ceremony and procession will take place at a designated time during the program.</p>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>WHAT WE NEED (Total $5000)</p>

<p>The festival will take place from November to June, with several film screenings and events to culminate in the final event called “Migrations”, a 10-days-celebration which will involve communities, associations and all local cultural entities which make our neighborhood, with its contradictory and unexpected beauty, so unique in Rome.</p>

It will be also an occasion for them to see on the big screen colors, sounds and traditions of their countries.</p>
<p>To make both the language and the cultures portrayed by the films comprehensible to Italian citizens too, we will need to subtitle them.</p>

<p><strong><strong>The Project</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>Talking Heads</strong> </strong>is a multi-media installation with live-action film, animation film, a simulated newspaper and a human-like sculpture dealing with how society forms opinions and how society regards its own problems.</p>
<p>The audience sees two films simultaneously. The first is an animated film of a news report embedded into a newspaper.  Flat screen monitors built into the newspaper display show the animated films with their headlines. </p>
<p>Simultaneously displayed is a live action film; a face in close-up is projected onto a ‘head’ screen of a mannequin who appears to be reading the newspaper. </p>

<p><strong>Artists' Statement</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael and my work </strong>is concerned with social issues and uses irony and comedic values to illuminate how the social rules and conventions are applied.</p>
<p>While we are interested in illuminating societal issues, our work is not documentary, nor is it political activism art; we are not after collective responses.  Our interest is in telling stories that prompt viewers to examine their own beliefs and values.</p>
<p>In this piece, we want people to scrutinize how we, and they, perceive problems in our society. It is easy to make a story where a societal problem, such as discrimination, is the villain. We all identify as the good guys and everyone goes home patting themselves on the back. Everyone is against discrimination; no one is for it, and yet, it clearly still exists. We feel that examination of the discrimination of certain social groups in a supportive way creates a more personal understanding.</p>
<p>We often use a non-threatening, fictional race, chairs.   Across all cultures, genders, and ages, everyone understands chairs. The viewer is invited to think of these universal objects in new contexts and new dimensions. By portraying chairs as a distinct race or segment of society, we examine the relevant social issues without evoking culturally specific or defensive responses.  The viewer is invited to examine his or her responses to these social issues while also processing the comments, opinions and facial expressions shown in the reaction film.  The viewer is forced to question internally “Do I agree? Do I think differently? What is really is the issue here?”</p>
<p><strong>Where Will Your Donation Go?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Your donation</strong><em> </em>will go towards:</p>
<p>1) Building the installation displays</p>
<p>2) Adding three new scenes and augmenting certain scenes of the film</p>

</div></div>","The Project
Talking Heads is a multi-media installation with live-action film, animation film, a simulated newspaper and a human-like sculpture dealing with how society forms opinions and how society regards its own problems.
The audience sees two films simultaneously. The first is an animated film of a news report embedded into a newspaper.  Flat screen monitors built into the newspaper display show the animated films with their headlines. 
Simultaneously displayed is a live action film; a face in close-up is projected onto a ‘head’ screen of a mannequin who appears to be reading the newspaper. 
The films are synchronized so that the live-action “face” film appears to be commenting and reacting to the animated “news” film in real time.  Using this method, the audience is simultaneously exposed to a story and to another person’s reaction to that story.  The viewer is supplied with a context for his or her opinions and a larger societal view. Talking Heads is an encounter with film to encourage meta-cognition about one’s own views.

Sto lavorando al
progetto di arte pubblica Il tuo Volto Domani, un archivio territoriale delle
memorie degli abitanti del Giambellino di Milano,
quartiere il cui assetto urbano è da tempo in discussione.
Attraverso questo progetto voglio sottolineare l’impatto delle politiche urbane e degli interessi economici a scapito delle comunità che abitano i quartieri, coinvolgendo gli abitanti in un atto di appropriazione del luogo  che risvegli in loro un sentimento di appartenenza e un desiderio personale di raccontarsi. Per costruire questo archivio sto raccogliendo e interrando alcuni  oggetti appartenenti agli abitanti del
quartiere, il cui valore è legato alla casa, alla città o a una esperienza
migratoria. Gli oggetti, custoditi all’interno di capsule del tempo, saranno
seppelliti nelle zone del quartiere maggiormente interessate dalla futura
gentrificazione e la loro posizione sarà indicata su una mappa. Ad ogni capsula
corrisponde un codice, ad ogni codice una voce, un racconto breve cui
l’oggetto, se sarà disseppellito a causa della trasformazione urbana, andrà a
ricongiungersi. Le voci e la mappa andranno a comporre un’installazione finale
e saranno poi donati al quartiere. Gli abitanti, chiamati a raccontare la
comunità e a salvaguardarne la memoria, diventano prima custodi delle loro
storie e, poi, testimoni della trasformazione avvenuta.

Ho iniziato Il
tuo Volto Domani nel febbraio 2014 perchè invitata a realizzare un intervento
artistico in Giambellino per il progetto Dencity. Nei due mesi trascorsi a
Milano, grazie ad una residenza artistica offerta da FARE, ho conosciuto alcuni
degli abitanti del quartiere, raccolto i loro oggetti, costruito e interrato
alcune capsule.
Conclusa questa
collaborazione, ho deciso di continuare e ampliare il progetto con la curatrice
Francesca Apolito con la quale sto avviando, in maniera indipendente, una
seconda fase del progetto. Per farlo abbiamo bisogno di spostarci da Bologna a
Milano e lavorare nel quartiere Giambellino per coinvolgere quanti più abitanti
possibili. 
Ogni contributo è
fondamentale! 
Il tuo aiuto ci
permette di tornare a Milano, raccogliere altri oggetti, costruire nuove
capsule e lavorare all'installazione audio.
 A cosa serve il
tuo supporto:


 viaggi
Bologna - Milano


 alloggio a
Milano


 trasporti

I am Valentina Medda, visual artist who lives and works in Bologna and NY .
I'm working on a
project Il tuo Volto Domani, a territorial archive of
memories of the inhabitants of Giambellino,
characteristic neighborhood of Milan, whose future urban planning has long been
questioned.
The memories,
collected in the form of personal items linked to one’s home, to the city or to
one’s migratory experience, are kept within time capsules made by the artist,
localized within a map and buried in the areas most threatened by future
gentrification. Each capsule has a code corresponding to the story of the
object. The object and the story will be reunited only in case a urban
transformation occurs and the capsule is unearthed.The voices and the map will
create the final installation and will be then donated to the district.
The project
aims at highlighting the impact of urban policy and economic interests at the
expense of the community that inhabits the district, involving residents in an
act of appropriation of their place, awakening a sense of belonging and a
personal desire to tell their stories and mark their passage
Il Tuo Volto
Domani started in February 2014 because I was invited to
realize a urban intervention in Giambellino within the project Dencity. During
the two months I spent in Milan, thanks to an artist residency offered by FARE,
I met some of the neighborhood's inhabitants, I collected their objects, built
the capsules and buried them.
This collaboration
is over but I've now decided to continue the project independently together
with curator Francesca Apolito. In order to do this we need to go back to Milan and work in the neighborhood to involve as many people as possible in our project. 
 Each contribution
is crucial!
 Your help enables us
to go back to Milan, collect other objects, build more capsules and work on the audio installation.
 What is your
support for:


Travel Bologna -
Milan


Accommodation in
Milan


Transportation
within the city


Materials for the
construction of the capsules


Rent materials for
documentation and recording stories (camera and recorder)


Construction audio
installation


Event final
presentation of the project

<p>In the center of the Diodome stands a platform supporting a glowing frosted hemisphere. As you touch and stroke this surface the colors around you respond, creating a space of colored light that envelopes and surrounds you and your friends.

<p>This years project is just the first phase. We have plans for a great many variations in the future with the addition of sound, motion tracking and various other forms of interaction making this a project we can bring back to the playa in fresh and exciting ways for years to come.</p>
<h3>What do we need the money for?</h3>
<p>We are building custom electrical hardware to run the hundreds of LEDs that make up the dome. We're also getting an 18ft 5/8ths geodesic dome that will make the foundation of the Diodome. In order to get the effect seen in the video we need to make custom internal and external skins from translucent material. We'll also be using the money for transportation for the dome and all the equipment necessary to power it on the playa.</p>
<p>We're funding about 1/3rd of the cost of the project ourselves, but we need your help to cover the rest.</p>
<p>One of the great things about this project is the versatility. Once we have the basic system in place we'll be able to modify it to do a variety of other projects without having to outlay a lot of money again, so your contribution will be helping a lot of future art as well.</p>
<h3>What have we done before?</h3>
<p>In 2010 we built the Illuminatrix, a 4ft x 4ft LED display that was built in the UK and transported to the Playa. This consisted of 256 LEDs showing hundreds of animations created by us and other Burners around the world.

<p>Writers, outdoorsmen (&amp; women), artists,  - you'll love it here.</p>
<p>Only 9.4 miles from Palm Springs, yet, quieter, darker, and cooler. The air is fresh, the views are unparalleled, the cabin is quaint and comfortable - a home for the traveling outdoorsman - or artist that want's some much needed inspitation. </p>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>Hermit Springs is a stone cabin located right outside of the vacation city of Palm Springs, California. It lays within the 272,000 acre Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument where you will enjoy beautiful unobstructed views of the 10,835’ north face of Mt. San Jacinto and have unparalleled door front access to the world famous Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) which stretches over 2,600 miles from Mexico to Canada.</p>
<p>In addition to staying in a unique environment that is perfect for hikers and photographers, other optional outdoor activities here include alpine climbing, bouldering, dune exploration, paragliding and more.</p>
<p><strong>Hermit Springs is located at 1,200' elevation - making it a consistent 10 to 15 degrees cooler than the rest of Palm Springs year round.</strong></p>
<p>This little stone 'cottage' has recently been refurbished - it now features reclaimed and custom milled mesquite hardwood floors, hand-plastered walls, an open beam wood ceiling, two wood-burning fireplaces, a designer stainless steel kitchen with a massive farm sink, a professional stainless steel range, and a full-sized modern stainless steel refrigerator. For eating: an acacia and steel pub table is perfect for sharing a drink while discussing adventures, playing games, or journaling your thoughts for the day.</p>
<p>You'll also enjoy a massive custom built 4'X6' tumbled travertine bathtub with dual 8"" brass rain shower heads. Three, six-gallon carboy glass bottles set in the west wall light up the shower in the late afternoon, yet provide total privacy while enjoying a refreshing dip.</p>
<p>The bathroom features an antique baroque mirror, a hand-hammered Indian vessel sink and a vintage cabinet from the 1800‘s with a solid granite top. Two fir shaker-style pocket doors provide privacy and easy access from both the bedroom and the living room. Extra toiletries can be found therein.</p>
<p>An extra long bed with antique solid oak head and footboards accommodates two comfortably and two more guests can stay in the living room on an air mattress. Extra blankets and sheets are in the walk-in closet where you can also store your luggage and provide extra space for jackets, backpacks, or other bulky items.</p>
<p>Outside is a six-seater iron furniture set placed in natural desert landscape. In the yard are barrel cactus, aloe, agave, palo verde, desert willow, nolina, cholla, prickly pear, yerba santa, creosote, cottonwood, etc. Many have amazing blooms in the spring, but others bloom in the summer. There is also a classic Weber kettle BBQ charcoal grill for outdoor grilling during the cool of the day.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT MAKES MY HERMIT SPRINGS SO SPECIAL?<br/><br/></strong>Hermit Springs is special because of the unique history and landscape surrounding this property. Timothy Leary and John Barrymore Jr. were both occupants at one time and the mountain views are spectacular. Huell Howser of “California’s Gold” even visited this little cabin at one point for a special on PBS. In addition, there are not many homes with this sort of view that also happen to be on the Pacific Crest Trail.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm André van der Hoeven, a physics teacher from the Netherlands. About 2,5 years ago I started making highschool teaching materials for my students about astronomy. This resulted in a book about astronomy for 16-18 year old students and a lesson series in which I introduce them into the beauties of our universe. The book, which is in Dutch, can be found here:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.astro-photo.nl/photoblog/publications/ANW_astronomie.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">book</a></p>
<p>Several students have been triggered by these lessons already to start studying physics or related topics. Also a student won a price last year with the European Space Agency for his research on variable stars which he performed together with me.</p>
<p>When I started making the book I needed good images of objects in space and I started looking on the internet for them. Soon I got interested in making images myself and started using my first telescope and a CCD camera that I bought in that time.</p>
<p>This hobby developed very quickly and resulted in dozens of images of objects that were published in several magazines and even on the NASA astronomy picture of the day website. An overview of my imaging results can be found <a href=""http://www.astro-photo.nl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Astrophotography website"">here</a>.  I also shared images with several educational resources and work on developing more teaching materials to motivate students to get into the scientific research. One of my future plans is to publish a book with astrophotography of the most beautiful objects in space.</p>
<p><img alt=""The heart nebula"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.astro-photo.nl/wp_astro/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ic1805_hubble_final_26112012_v6-726x1024.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""The Heart nebula""/></p>
<p>Image of the Heart Nebula made in October/November 2012 using my equipment.</p>
Recently I have been contacted with the organisers of the NASA 'A human adventure' exhibition that will be opened on June 13th in the Jaarbeurs in Utrecht. This exhibition will have an estimated 250.000 visitors in six months time.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Talking with them they gave me the opportunity to exhibit my works nearby the exhibition and have people enjoy my imagery.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I worked out a plan in which I will put up about 15 canvases of images with sizes ranging from 1x1 meter to even 2x1 meter.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Some examples are shown here:</div>
<div> </div>
<div><img alt=""canvas"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.astro-photo.nl/raw/1.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""canvas""/></div>

<h3>Why do I ask for your help?</h3>
<p>Setting up an exhibition like this asks quite a lot of investments. Canvases in these size cost quite some money and therefor I need a starting capital to do this. The total costs of the canvases is an estimated 2500 euro. Furthermore I need some money to cover the perks and fees connected with crowdfunding, filling up the other 750 euros.</p>
<p>So you might think what do I have to offer in return? If you want to help me setting up this exhibition I'm offering a unique opportunity to obtain astro-art for you at home.</p>
Depending on the invested funds I'm offering high-quality prints and canvases of images that you can choose from my website. For the top investors I will offer the opportunity to image an object of your choice (in mutual discussion of course, because not everything is possible) and get a print of that.</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your investment will make it possible for &gt;200000 people to enjoy my imagery of objects in the universe and will make it possible for myself to share this with them. Furthermore I can use the coverage to find resources to improve the teaching materials that will be freely available to all teachers and students in the Netherlands. If funding is succesful a future possibility could even be a translation of the book in English, but that needs quite some more time.</p>
<p>My students are enthousiastic about the astronomy lessons and it gives them a good indication of what science has to offer for a future career. This exhibition could provide means to reach even much more people than only my own students.</p>
If I will not reach the goal the money will be put on hold until enough resources have been gathered to start the exhibition. The prints and canvases will be still made using the current images on the site and possible future imagery.</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
If you can't contribute for this project I would still be happy if you could share this project with your friends/family/acquaintances.</div>

here – you may have seen me on Brandon Stanton's Humans of New York with my dogs Monty and Saki.
Pamela Moore and I really are working on a book about Monty and his imaginary
friend QP. The outline is done and most of the text is too. We are working on
the illustrations now. 
This journey began five
years ago on a snowy New Year’s Eve. I was laid up with a cold, but we had seen
Monty’s picture on the internet and I had fallen in love with him. Pamela had
the day off and rushed over to Brooklyn to fill out the paperwork at a shelter
called BARC (Brooklyn Animal Resource Coalition). I thought he’d already be
gone or they’d be closed because of the holiday but to my great delight she
returned home with Monty in tow just a few hours later.
MONTY IS THE BEST - BUT HE HAS A FARAWAY LOOK IN HIS EYESHe really is the best dog.
He has a few issues – fear of cars, fear of skateboards, irritation when petted
by strangers – but we don’t blame him. When he was found running stray in the
Highbridge section of the Bronx he was in pretty bad shape. We were told that
he might have been living on the streets for six months. But it didn’t take him
long to love us and get over most of his issues.
However he has always had a
far away look in his eyes. And I swear he sometimes looks into the distance
with a funny smile on his face transfixed by some unknown entity. Pamela and I
each caught him doing this so many times that one day I figured it out – “He
has an imaginary friend!” I exclaimed. 
QP IS BORN AND THE BOOK FOLLOWS SUITFast-forward a year and
Pamela and I decided to launch a vintage emporium at a local flea market. At

your help to raise the funds to pay for the illustrations and then to print the book.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>What we want to do:</strong></p>
<p>We want to convert our studio space into a pop-up gallery running from Friday evening until Sunday featuring groups of local artists doing eveything from sculpture, to painting, drawing, mixed media, installations, performance, video and handcrafted items all in downtown Napanee!!!</p>
<p>All on the same weekends as the nearby farmers market thereby co-supporting each other.</p>
<p>On the official opening on Friday we will serve locally produced goods for a full gallery experience. </p>

<p>I worked 2 years at a photography gallery on Queen St W in Toronto. <em>Lens Factory.</em> I independently hosted my own art shows there.

<p>Event Experience: Organized my first concert at 14. I Co-created charity coffee houses where I helped find talent, organized venue and equipment, and marketing. All procceeds to charity. Also a whole array of community development and education types of workshops. I was also a fashion show co-ordinator for Graduation En Vogue in Montreal. The final event had over 500 attendees. </p>
<p>My background is political science and community development.</p>
<p>Napanee Design Studio is a Think-Outside-The-Box creative and collaborative business venture that seeks to market and explore the beauty and depth of rural living and the entreprenuerial spirit. </p>
<p><strong>Why it's important to us:</strong></p>
<p>We are seeking to have a pop-up style art gallery in downtown Napanee which is rural-south eastern Ontario. This project is important to me because being a child of socio-economic disadvantage in a rural area I really didnt even know that one could actually be an ""artist"" I thought that was like wanting to be some fictitious profession like the tooth fairy. I think it is important to have opportunity and exposure to the arts and I find it lacking here. I would like the project to be very particpatory and give a place for many people to display their work and be inspired to use the creative parts of their brains and to dream. To not work in isolation. </p>
<p>Its also important to me because I see and meet so many talented people and yet there is no place in the public sphere for them to display or create a dialogue. That needs to start.</p>
<p>We will also have the pop-up gallery events co-ordinated on the same dates as the Talents of the Town/Farmers Market. ideally we will have an official opening night on the Friday and serve locally sourced goods. Then have full hours on Saturday and Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>How you will help :)</strong></p>
<p>The creative economy is the future economy. You will be helping expose so many young people to new ideas and inspire connections and help the creation of a creative community right in the heart of Napanee. </p>
<p>You will help create a positive cultural outlet. </p>
<p>You will also help to create a stronger rural fabric of identity; People need to tell their stories and experience somewhere.</p>
<p>This space will not only be used as a gallery we want to work on teaching about seasonal food and eating and healthy cooking recipes aimed at young families. We hope for it to be a cultural centre for all kinds of mediums. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>We want to bring fun, activity and creativity to the hospital bound child! </strong></p>
<p><strong>We have built children’s games. We have made children’s toys. We have shared the making of these things with children at camps and schools. <span>We are Critical Mass Interactive, Inc., an Austin based transmedia company, founded in 2003. We have built games for kids from SpongeBob SquarePants to Freaky Pets. We have also contributed a fully animated PSA for the State of Texas Department of Agriculture My Pyramid Cafe nutrition campaign.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Now we want to support healing through the arts.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Art of Healing Project will bring activities and projects to the children by way of visiting artists, animators, musicians, actors, sculptors, painters and writers who will come to the hospital with hands-on, inclusive sessions on a rotating schedule.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We have visited the wonderful Dell’s Children's Hospital in Austin, and they have agreed to allow us to bring The Art of Healing to the children! What we are doing is bringing art to a group of 20 to 30 young patients for each event. We are preparing our first event for March and we need your help.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The first event will bring designing and drawing for games by way of individual iPads, with drawing apps, and presentations from the best character artists in Austin. </strong></p>
<p><strong>We need your help in the initial pilot project support needs, after which we will have a demonstrated organization and product to go after corporate sponsors to expand on this success.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our long term goal is to bring the arts to children in hospitals across the country, to help lift their spirits, their energy, their creativity and, most importantly, their healing.</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>The Art of Healing is going to start with an iPad2 for each patient, with drawing, painting, music and game apps already installed. A drawing stylus will be provided, as well.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Art of Healing will also require a base budget to support the team’s efforts organizing and building the project beyond the first event.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The initial fund being raised to jumpstart the project is $50,000.00, based upon the following cost estimates:</strong></p>
<p><strong>iPad2, 16 Gig, WIFI only tablet, cover, $400</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pengo Stylus, $35</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pengo replacement nibs (6), $35</strong></p>
<p><strong>Drawing and other apps, $30.00</strong></p>
<p><strong>Costs per child, $500</strong></p>
<p><strong>Costs per initial groups (60 children)                              $30,000.00</strong></p>
<p><strong>Admin and support                                                            $15,000.00</strong></p>
<p><strong>Initial Marketing Costs                                                      $5,000.00</strong></p>
<p><strong>Total Estimated Budget for the Pilot Project              $50,000.00</strong></p>
<p><strong>As supporters of The Art of Healing, you will be privy to content generated by the group (in the form of wallpapers, calendars and cards). We will use this content to raise funds for additional programs at Dell's Children's Hospital through online and instore sales.</strong></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong><span>We have been supporting camps and groups of students over the years, showing them how games are made, how to draw, sculpt, animate, etc. We have also been building game products for kids over the past 15 years, from Spongebob Squarepants to Freaky Pets. </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>We have also had family members and friends in treatment at hospitals and rehab centers, and we know that a happy, creative mind aids in healing.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>This is our opportunity to make a difference in the health and lives of the children at Dell’s Children’s Hospital.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>We would like to provide an enlightening, entertaining experience focused on the Arts, from drawing to music to performance, bringing in the great variety of Austin-based talent from the Game, Film, Theater, Dance and Music Communities, to inspire the minds and hearts of the children when they need this positive energy the most for their healing.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>We are working closely with the great Staff at Dell’s Children’s Hospital to tailor the events to the well-being of the patients, and building an extended support network to ensure the quality and variety of the Arts content provided to them.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>The ultimate goal of the pilot project is to set down the template of this process so that we can iterate it to other children’s health facilities across the country, and to offer the program up for sponsorship and expansion so every child in recovery will have the opportunity to access the Arts, expand their minds and imaginations, and gain strength for their healing.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>We come from various backgrounds to this task and are forming the new entity, The Art of Healing LLC, once this pilot project is funded. Please help us make this a reality.</span></strong></p>

The ultimate goal of the pilot project is to set down the template of this process so that we can iterate it to other children’s health facilities across the country, and to offer the program up for sponsorship and expansion so every child in recovery will have the opportunity to access the Arts, expand their minds and imaginations, and gain strength for their healing.
We come from various backgrounds to this task and are forming the new entity, The Art of Healing LLC, once this pilot project is funded. Please help us make this a reality.

<p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>
<p>My name is Fabrizio Constanza and I am an artist
and a designer.   I have been creating functional art for nearly
two decades and have seen, through my work, the positive impact art has on
people. </p>
<p>My Sculpture “The Support of the Cube” was
selected to be exhibited at the 2015 ArtPrize® in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  ArtPrize® is a radically open, independently
organized international art competition and a 501(c)(3) non-profit
organization.  ArtPrize® attracts over
400,000 visitors with over 1,600 artists participating from 42 states and 48
countries. With your support, I will have the opportunity to reach and inspire
thousands of art aficionados that visit the three week exhibit.</p>
<p>As a designer, I create collectable objects for
private clients.  It is both an amazing
experience and a privilege.  In the last
two years, I have received six international design awards, four from Milan, Italy
and two from California, U.S.A.. These awards have positioned me as the most
awarded designer in Central America.  My
company, Fabrizio Constanza Design, focuses on creating investment art objects.
I spend a significant percentage of resources in guaranteeing my products
maintain and gain market value.  </p>
<p>As an artist, I seek to inspired people. In
2014 I participated in both New York Design Week and Paris Design Week, with
the sole purpose of exposing my work to the general public.  Viewers’ reactions were fantastic and
inspired me to create my first public sculpture, <i>“The Support of the Cube”</i>.  I
believe it is important to share this piece with art collectors and the general
public alike, so I decided to participate in an international art competition
that focused on making the competing pieces available to all who wish to
experience the intrigue and beauty of art.</p>
<p><b>THE
ART</b></p>
<p><i>“The
Support of the Cube”</i> piece is a conceptual work
that explores the relationship between human emotions and human progress. The
piece intends to inspire people to approach the present global challenges with
flexible solutions, which I passionately perceive as the next step in human
development. </p>
<p>The sculpture combines five major elements:
one 4’x4’x4’ Cube manufactured entirely of ultra polished sheet metal, and four
organic shaped metal legs. The cube traps and combines the reflection of
spectators and their surroundings, making them a part of the cube. The fluid
and twisted legs are a conceptual representation of human emotions and creativity
- the very core of our inventiveness.  I
encourage viewers to reflect on:  </p>
<p>•   Admiring a cube rather than being
trapped within in it</p>
<p>•   How emotions support human creations</p>
<p>•   Why, if our emotions are so fluid, is
our progress so rigid? </p>
<p>•   Will humanity some day in our future
be able to look back at this time and be    amazed by how far we were able to get with
such rigid systems and/or be    struck by the naiveté of our culture?</p>
<p>While
the sculpture meaning is profound, I encourage people to also simply enjoy the composition.
The object was designed to feel dynamic, well balanced and a joy to observe.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>THE OPPORTUNITY</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Participating
in ArtPrize® requires a process where artists connect with curators.  I am honoured my sculpture was selected to exhibit
at the Grand Rapids City Hall. The project’s current expenses are $18,000. This
includes: materials, manufacturing, insurance, printing of material, shipping
to/from Grand Rapids, Michigan, travel to Denver, Colorado to supervise
production, and travel expenses to/in Grand Rapids Michigan during the three
weeks of the event.</p>
<p>The
project exceeds my initial production budget of $8,000 - this is where the collaboration
of a sponsor becomes critical.   Sponsorship will enable me to exhibit “The
Support of the Cube” at ArtPrize® and share its complex beauty with thousands
of sophisticated and novice art admirers alike.</p>
<p><b>THE
IMPACT</b></p>
<p>The
primary objective of the <i>“The Support of
the Cube”</i> project is to encourage decision makers to think and act outside
the box. I have run my design business based on three essential principles that
support this philosophy: first, to ensure my products exceed client
expectations; second, that my collaborators have the opportunity to provide a
more beautiful future to the next generation, and third, to provide my own family
with a better environment and brighter future.  I am able to encourage a better community and
culture of doing business by combining all three of these principles in all
that I do. </p>
<p><i>Examples of these principles
in action:</i></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>In 2007, I founded a custom
furniture and interior decorating studio in Guatemala and subcontracted with three
Guatemalan artisans. Today, each one runs a small business and a crew of three
to five skilled artisans.  I sold the
company in 2012 and am proud that it is still one of the most impactful custom
furniture studios featuring Guatemalan craftsmanship in Central America. I have
experienced the rewards of making a difference and creating a positive
environment for those in my country that may not have otherwise had the
opportunity.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>In 2007-08’, I developed a
charity project, The Charity Chair, for Starlight Children’s Foundation -
Colorado.  The organization auctioned two
donated KSD-2 Lounge chairs for charitable funds.  All funds raised (after production expenses)
went to the organization and the seriously ill children and families that it
served.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>In 2014, I exhibited in the
ICFF (International Contemporary Furniture Fair) with the main objective of
exposing people to the thought-provoking Strange Land series.  The series explores how we block our emotions
as a form of a protective shield and as a result our natural feelings become “strange”
to us.  Viewers of the series were
sensitive and receptive to the message and I hope made a difference in the life
of at least one person. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>THE
REWARD</b></p>
<p>I
believe in <i>“The Support of the Cube”,</i>
the message it extends to those who view it and the impact that art has on
humanity.  By supporting this project,
you not only ensure <i>“The Support of the
Cube”</i> participation in 2015 ArtPrize® but you will be enabling the joy and
consciousness that art can inspire.  I
look forward to collaborating with you!</p>

<p>Catamount Film &amp; Arts has been a cultural hub in Vermont's Northeast Kingdom for nearly 40 years. In that time it has become very clear to us that providing our community with access to means of creative expression is essential to its well-being. Catamount Arts Center houses two theaters showing independent, foreign, and classic films, an art gallery showcasing local and regional artists, a community performance space, and multiple classrooms in which painting, drawing, theater and music classes take place. <br/>
</p>
<p>We are also committed to providing arts experiences to folks who may not be able to come to our Arts Center. In 2013 we embarked on a partnership with Northeast Kingdom Community Action to integrate the arts into Head Start preschools. Our aim was and is to provide these children with a well-rounded education and an opportunity to express themselves through the arts. We provide a framework for teaching artists and classroom teachers to collaborate on arts-based lessons, and work to weave the arts into the curriculum in a way that helps children to learn different concepts including reading, motor skills and social skills.  </p>
<p>We were successful in achieving these goals last year in <b><i>one</i></b> classroom. This year, as a member of the Vermont Arts Council's Head Start Arts Partnership, we are bringing this flourishing experience to <b><i>four</i></b> classrooms, and plan to expand to the remaining <b><i>four</i></b> NEK classrooms in the next few years. That's more than 300 children! But we need your help: In order to expand this program, we need to be able to bring in more teachers and more supplies. We need to be able to offer more time: time in the classroom, time for planning lessons, time for evaluations. All of this adds up in dollars that we do not quite have. <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The give and the get:<br/>

<p>By providing the Kingdom's children with an arts-based education from an early age, the Arts Partnership also gives them multiple avenues of expression and purpose, and raises their aspirations.

<p>-Low-income students who were exposed to the arts in high school were 
at least three times as likely to earn a Bachelor's degree as low-income students

</div><p><b>The Project</b></p>
<p>My name is Luke and I
        have always been a huge fan of the arts, particularly music. I play
        the saxophone
        and the guitar, and I love creating and playing music. Being
        able to share my
        ideas and work with others is very important to me. Another
        thing that is
        important to me is my church and fellow Christians. I
        participate in a youth
        group that meets at Convergence. 
        Convergence and Convergence Arts Initiative was created
        to explore the
        Intersection of Art, Faith and the Human experience.   </p>
<p>I have had many
        wonderful experiences there.   When I create and share my
        music, I want to be
        somewhere with bright colors, open space, and this is exactly
        what Convergence is
        creating for many arts organizations in the community.  I want to help Convergence
        continue to
        fulfill that mission.</p>
<p>So I have chosen to
        work with Convergence for my Eagle Scout project. Boy Scouts is all about helping others, and this is a great opportunity to do that. I will be
        leading fellow
        scouts in renovating the kitchen space
        and playground
        area.  The project will
        involve lots of
        painting, cleaning, construction, and repairing. We will be
        spending three
        weekends working at Convergence and by the time its done, we will have
        enhanced this
        welcoming, inspiring place.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b><span>Why We Need Your Help</span></b></p>
<p>My fellow scouts and I need your donations
        to pay for all sorts of supplies that are required to complete
        this project. We
        will need wood, paint, power tools, floor tiles, and many other
        supplies. These materials will cost over $800, and that is why I need your support. With your help, we can support
        Convergence as
        they continue to create affordable spaces for the arts and arts
        organizations
        in our community.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Without your help,
        this project cannot happen. The supplies that your donations go
        towards will
        help update the playground, repair a shed, build a picnic table
        with benches,
        install a new tile floor inside, paint and repair cabinets and
        drawers, as well
        as various other jobs.</p>
<p>On the playground, a
        gardening class for children will soon begin that needs to take
        place in a safe
        and clean environment. Not only do several groups meet inside
        the building
        regularly, events such as plays often take place there. Having
        this new,
        inspiring atmosphere will help encourage people to come and
        participate in
        activities that could change their lives.</p>

</div></div>","Who are Mayor Von Frinzius?


(EN) Mayor Von Frinzius (MVF) is an inclusive theatre company made up of 80 actors and directed by 5 directors. We meet up twice a week and rehears at Teatro Carlo Goldoni, in Livorno, where, since 2008, all our new productions have debuted at the end of May. Our shows usually last about two hours, during which every single member of the group is actively part of the play for every single minute. 
(ITA) La Mayor Von Frinzius è una compagnia teatrale composta da 80 attori e diretta da 5 registi. Ci riuniamo due volte a settimana per provare nella Sala degli Specchi del Teatro Carlo Goldoni di Livorno, dove, sin dal 2008, tutte le nostre produzioni hanno debuttato alla fine di maggio. I nostri spettacoli durano solitamente due ore, durante le quali ogni attore della compagnia è parte attiva del tutto, ogni singolo minuto. 


(EN) What makes us so special? We
welcome everyone from all walks of life with half our company living with
physical or mental issues (e.g. Downs Syndrome, blindness, autism).
(ITA) Cosa ci rende così speciali? Metà dei nostri attori hanno qualche disabilità (come ad esempio sindrome di Down o autismo).

(EN) Together, we like to call ourselves a Theatre Company (yes! with capital letters), not a theatre laboratory. We believe in the great power of authenticity and our aim is bringing this to the stage, every single time. We have been having a lot of fun and have built strong friendships since 1997. We have helped people to express themselves, to transform their weaknesses into powerful theatrical characters, we have faced personal problems all together, we have cried together and laughed together, we have danced until our feet were numb, we have brought our emotions and fears to the stage and dismissed them together with our audience. Having performed for almost 20 years now, we have won national and international prizes and have conquered and warmed the hearts of different audiences across Italy. Yet, we find ourselves struggling to cover all our expenses every year, and especially since 2009's recession, it is more difficult each year for us to bring to life our beliefs and dreams.
(ITA) Ci piace definirci una Compagnia Teatrale (sì, con le maiuscole!), non un laboratorio teatrale. Crediamo fermamente nella forza dell'autenticità e il nostro obiettivo è portare questa autenticità sul palco. Ci divertiamo, piangiamo, ridiamo insieme, abbiamo creato legami fortissimi tra di noi sin dal 1997, quando la Compagnia ha iniziato la sua attività. Abbiamo aiutato persone ad esprimersi, a trasformare le loro debolezze in personaggi potentissimi sul palco, abbiamo affrontato perdite e problemi personali insieme, abbiamo ballato fino a non sentire più i nostri piedi, abbiamo portato sul palco le nostre paure e le nostre emozioni e le abbiamo esorcizzate insieme al nostro pubblico. 
Siamo attivi da 20 anni e abbiamo vinto premi nazionali e internazionali, e conquistato ed emozionato tantissimi italiani. Tuttavia, ci troviamo in grande difficoltà a coprire le nostre spese e specialmente dal 2009, ogni anno diventa per noi più difficile far diventare realtà i nostri sogni, ciò in cui crediamo.



(EN) We think our project deserves to continue bringing happiness to our actors, our actors' families, our directors, our city and our community of fans and supporters. More than anything, we deserve to be able to perform our 2017 production in as many theatres as possible. This is where you can help!
(ITA) Crediamo fermamente che il nostro sia un progetto unico che meriti di continuare ad esistere e portare grandi soddisfazioni ai nostri attori, alle loro famiglie, ai registi, alla nostra città e alla nostra comunità di fan e sostenitori. Più di ogni altra cosa, per noi sarebbe fantastico poterci esibire non solo al Teatro Goldoni, ma in moltissimi altri posti. 
È qui che puoi entrare in gioco!

Francesco is 20 years old and wants to become a songwriter. During the all short he tries to find a producer to sell his new album, that no-one except him can listen to yet. One night, a strange character gives him the address of a producer, that same night he, his sister and their goldfish travel a long way towards this great opportunity.  
Francesco ed Eleonora sono fratello e sorella e vivono da soli con il loro pesciolino rosso dopo la scomparsa dei loro genitori. Francesco ha 20 anni e sogna di diventare un cantautore. Durante tutto il corto è alla ricerca di un produttore grazie al quale possa vendere il suo nuovo CD, che nessuno può ascoltare eccetto lui. Una notte, uno strano personaggio gli confida il contatto di un produttore, quella stessa notte, parte per un viaggio insieme alla sorella e al pesciolino verso una grande opportunità.





CAST
STEFANO RIGGI : Writer and Director



ALESSIO MODICA : Actor


SARA LEOPARDI : Actress



FRANCESCO MARUCCIA : Actor and Producer





 Our cast is constantly gaining new people to make the best out of this project.
Il nostro cast è in continua crescita grazie a nuove persone e figure professionali per far si che il progetto venga al meglio.
    Music
Music is very important for our story. Francesco is a young song writer, so the short itself has to prove how much he loves music. In the film there will be three songs performed by Alessio himself, and one of them is original.

La musica è molto importante ai fini della nostra storia. Francesco è un giovane cantautore, perciò il corto stesso deve provare quanto il protagonista ami la musica. Durante il film ci saranno tre brani cantati e suonati dallo stesso Alessio, uno dei quali sarà completamente originale.











We hope you are excited to see Franklin as much as we are. Thank you for reading and funding our project.


Speriamo che voi vogliate vedere Franklin quanto lo vogliamo noi. Grazie per aver letto e per aver finanziato il nostro progetto.

<p>Ambigram Press is an assembly of four superfriends: Bach, Rahmat, Normann &amp; Sukaimi based in Singapore. We were formed around February 2013. Prior to our founding, we have always been avid screenprint enthusiasts and some of us are art students. We screenprinted t-shirts for local bands and distros as well as our own artworks on paper. Our first ever live screenprinting gig was at a non-profit event at the Substation Garden Singapore where there was an overwhelming response by people who wanted to get their t-shirts, handkerchiefs and pieces of paper printed with our anti-war designs. At that time, our methods and equipments were very basic. We had no proper t-shirt press, used water-based inks and large pails of water to soak and wash of the screens. This of course, proved quite messy and unproductive.</p>
<p>This inspired us to the idea of providing proper live screenprinting which could meet the demands of a crowd and yet retain superior quality. Thus, Ambigram Press was formed to perform live at events as well as offer custom t-shirt screenprinting with the help of proper equipment, inks and a renewed passion!</p>
<p>Visit <a href=""http://www.ambigrampress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Ambigram Press Website "">www.ambigrampress.com</a></p>
<h2>Why we need your help</h2>
<p>We need an extra push as we have exhausted our individual contributions to the establishment and we are in need of more support for our operation. Being a new start-up, independant business, this extra help will go to the funding of these two essential items:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>A flash cure (S$ 1300 / USD$ 1060)</h3>
</li>
</ul><p>This flash cure is essential to our screenprinting process especially in our ‘live event’ situations. Instead of using water-based inks like our first live screenprinting event last time, we plan to use plastisol inks which do not air dry thus preventing the ink to dry on the screen. The flash cure will ‘heat’ the plastisol print on the tee to make it semi-permanent. This is extremely useful for us as we would no longer need a water source for events to clean the screens everytime it gets clogged when the inks dry on it. As we also plan to hold workshops and demos for students, artists and screenprint enthusiasts in the future which could stretch for at most 2-3 hours per session, plastisol is the ideal ink to use for this situation and the use of plastisol means a flash cure is needed. We plan to purchase this flash cure from this local vendor. The price is also listed there.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<h3>An entry level dryer (S$ 2000 / USD$ 1620)</h3>
</li>
</ul><p>The dryer speeds up our curing process to ensure that the proper curing of the plastisol orders are done. At the same time, productivity on our orders are increased as we do not have to tend to the manual process of curing individual tee shirts. With the belt dryer, we could easily proceed and concentrate on our screen printing process, and allow the conveyor belt on the dryer to cure the inks fully. This would mean we would not have to individually check each and every single shirt if they are properly cured, thus eliminating bad printed jobs. For live events, this dryer will be very useful and efficient when faced with a large crowd. We plan to purchase this entry level D-100 dryer from this overseas vendor as there are no local distributors for this product. The price is also listed there.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Our total equipment cost inclusive of the admin fees/charges will be at a grandtotal of <strong>USD$2800</strong>. And if we do achieve exceeding our campaign target, we will channel the remaining proceeds to funding of additional shirts/inks/equipment. </p>

<p>With the help of your contributions, you can choose the perks listed on the right hand side and at the same time, it will help us secure the essential screenprinting equipments needed to fulfill your pledge and realise our potential to educate the community on live t-shirt screenprinting!</p>
<p>Also, with your help and upon completing our fund target, we would purchase these essential equipments immediately and will update each and every contribution through email and social media on the progress of purchase. We will start to process the perk orders and print your t-shirts with all the new acquired equipments that you have helped fund!</p>

Ambigram Press is an assembly of four superfriends: Bach, Rahmat, Normann & Sukaimi based in Singapore. We were formed around February 2013. Prior to our founding, we have always been avid screenprint enthusiasts and some of us are art students. We screenprinted t-shirts for local bands and distros as well as our own artworks on paper. Our first ever live screenprinting gig was at a non-profit event at the Substation Garden Singapore where there was an overwhelming response by people who wanted to get their t-shirts, handkerchiefs and pieces of paper printed with our anti-war designs. At that time, our methods and equipments were very basic. We had no proper t-shirt press, used water-based inks and large pails of water to soak and wash of the screens. This of course, proved quite messy and unproductive.
This inspired us to the idea of providing proper live screenprinting which could meet the demands of a crowd and yet retain superior quality. Thus, Ambigram Press was formed to perform live at events as well as offer custom t-shirt screenprinting with the help of proper equipment, inks and a renewed passion!

Why we need your help
We need an extra push as we have exhausted our individual contributions to the establishment and we are in need of more support for our operation. Being a new start-up, independant business, this extra help will go to the funding of these two essential items:


A flash cure (S$ 1300 / USD$ 1060)

This flash cure is essential to our screenprinting process especially in our ‘live event’ situations. Instead of using water-based inks like our first live screenprinting event last time, we plan to use plastisol inks which do not air dry thus preventing the ink to dry on the screen. The flash cure will ‘heat’ the plastisol print on the tee to make it semi-permanent. This is extremely useful for us as we would no longer need a water source for events to clean the screens everytime it gets clogged when the inks dry on it. As we also plan to hold workshops and demos for students, artists and screenprint enthusiasts in the future which could stretch for at most 2-3 hours per session, plastisol is the ideal ink to use for this situation and the use of plastisol means a flash cure is needed. We plan to purchase this flash cure from this local vendor. The price is also listed there.
Vastex F-1000 Flash Cure


An entry level dryer (S$ 2000 / USD$ 1620)

The dryer speeds up our curing process to ensure that the proper curing of the plastisol orders are done. At the same time, productivity on our orders are increased as we do not have to tend to the manual process of curing individual tee shirts. With the belt dryer, we could easily proceed and concentrate on our screen printing process, and allow the conveyor belt on the dryer to cure the inks fully. This would mean we would not have to individually check each and every single shirt if they are properly cured, thus eliminating bad printed jobs. For live events, this dryer will be very useful and efficient when faced with a large crowd. We plan to purchase this entry level D-100 dryer from this overseas vendor as there are no local distributors for this product. The price is also listed there.

Our total equipment cost inclusive of the admin fees/charges will be at a grandtotal of USD$2800. And if we do achieve exceeding our campaign target, we will channel the remaining proceeds to funding of additional shirts/inks/equipment. 

 
With the help of your contributions, you can choose the perks listed on the right hand side and at the same time, it will help us secure the essential screenprinting equipments needed to fulfill your pledge and realise our potential to educate the community on live t-shirt screenprinting!
Also, with your help and upon completing our fund target, we would purchase these essential equipments immediately and will update each and every contribution through email and social media on the progress of purchase. We will start to process the perk orders and print your t-shirts with all the new acquired equipments that you have helped fund!
We are pleased to add that ALL contributions will be listed on http://www.ambigrampress.com

<p>Resistor, an arts event space in Chicago, has enjoyed a whirlwind 10 months in business since opening last fall! Artists and musicians, whether world-renowned or just starting out, have performed, shown their work, and touched the lives of so many people in the short amount of time since Resistor opened its doors on October 21, 2016. Through art classes (drawing and painting), people have been inspired to create with renewed or newly-found vigor. Through performance nights and affordable space rental, Resistor has provided a springboard in which groups and individuals have transformed its four walls with their own visions and celebrations. </p>
<p>A little over a month ago, Resistor owner/founder Rani Young was told that the lease on the current space would not be up for renewal in the fall. After the devastating news sunk in, she regrouped and set out to find a new space in which to continue her commitment to supporting the Chicago creative community. A new and fantastic space was quickly (and miraculously) found, and daily efforts are being put into preparing to open up the new location on September 8, 2017!! </p>
<p>With the goal of continuing the arts programming and classes that were already scheduled for dates into 2018, as well as booking new and exciting performances and events, Rani is seeking funds to do the following:</p>
<p>- Pay for the unexpected costs of moving and purchasing supplies for setting up the new, larger space. This includes: moving van/truck rental; paint and painting supplies; larger PA speakers, retail display cases (art supplies and music accessories—cables, etc.—with be available for purchase); lighting and modifications to existing electrical work; and hardware and lumber which will be used to build low walls/partitions, storage areas, a modular riser/stage, and shelving.</p>
<p>- Help to offset lost revenue from business closing for two weeks during the final move/space prep, plus some loss of business due to two months of interruptions of normal functioning while space location and build-out began and continue (through September 8).</p>
<p>- Pay off the debt incurred from the build-out of the first location, which included constructing an art studio, office, and kitchenette within the original open space. </p>
<p>- Provide a financial pad for future months to help cover the slightly higher rent in the larger space.</p>
<div><h3> </h3></div>
</div><div>
<h3>A Personal Note from Rani</h3>
<p>Since sharing the news of the loss of Resistor's original location, I have been overwhelmed with the support of so many friends of the business—people who have performed or visited the space or followed my journey on social media since building my first walls at the original location (first time I've ever wrangled a chop saw, hung a door, installed drywall, or wired a chandelier!). A vibrant community has grown up around Resistor since its opening day, and this community has shown its caring in many ways—offers of assistance and labor, equipment, goods, time and talent, plus so many ideas and insights. Thank you to all who have stepped forward. I can’t thank you enough—each and every one of you—for the level of support you have shown, and for your talents and warmth. For those of you who would like to provide financial support to help me over this transitional hump, I’d like to give back through discounted dollar-for-dollar credit toward future interactions with the new space. Listed with this campaign are various reward levels/perks which you can use at any time in the future (no expiration date). Thank you for taking the time to review this campaign and for your continued goodwill. May it come back to you tenfold. I look forward to seeing you all at the new space! Onward and upward!! &lt;3</p>

</div></div>","The Resistor 2.0! Campaign
Resistor, an arts event space in Chicago, has enjoyed a whirlwind 10 months in business since opening last fall! Artists and musicians, whether world-renowned or just starting out, have performed, shown their work, and touched the lives of so many people in the short amount of time since Resistor opened its doors on October 21, 2016. Through art classes (drawing and painting), people have been inspired to create with renewed or newly-found vigor. Through performance nights and affordable space rental, Resistor has provided a springboard in which groups and individuals have transformed its four walls with their own visions and celebrations. 
A little over a month ago, Resistor owner/founder Rani Young was told that the lease on the current space would not be up for renewal in the fall. After the devastating news sunk in, she regrouped and set out to find a new space in which to continue her commitment to supporting the Chicago creative community. A new and fantastic space was quickly (and miraculously) found, and daily efforts are being put into preparing to open up the new location on September 8, 2017!! 
With the goal of continuing the arts programming and classes that were already scheduled for dates into 2018, as well as booking new and exciting performances and events, Rani is seeking funds to do the following:
- Pay for the unexpected costs of moving and purchasing supplies for setting up the new, larger space. This includes: moving van/truck rental; paint and painting supplies; larger PA speakers, retail display cases (art supplies and music accessories—cables, etc.—with be available for purchase); lighting and modifications to existing electrical work; and hardware and lumber which will be used to build low walls/partitions, storage areas, a modular riser/stage, and shelving.
- Help to offset lost revenue from business closing for two weeks during the final move/space prep, plus some loss of business due to two months of interruptions of normal functioning while space location and build-out began and continue (through September 8).
- Pay off the debt incurred from the build-out of the first location, which included constructing an art studio, office, and kitchenette within the original open space. 
- Provide a financial pad for future months to help cover the slightly higher rent in the larger space.
 

A Personal Note from Rani
Since sharing the news of the loss of Resistor's original location, I have been overwhelmed with the support of so many friends of the business—people who have performed or visited the space or followed my journey on social media since building my first walls at the original location (first time I've ever wrangled a chop saw, hung a door, installed drywall, or wired a chandelier!). A vibrant community has grown up around Resistor since its opening day, and this community has shown its caring in many ways—offers of assistance and labor, equipment, goods, time and talent, plus so many ideas and insights. Thank you to all who have stepped forward. I can’t thank you enough—each and every one of you—for the level of support you have shown, and for your talents and warmth. For those of you who would like to provide financial support to help me over this transitional hump, I’d like to give back through discounted dollar-for-dollar credit toward future interactions with the new space. Listed with this campaign are various reward levels/perks which you can use at any time in the future (no expiration date). Thank you for taking the time to review this campaign and for your continued goodwill. May it come back to you tenfold. I look forward to seeing you all at the new space! Onward and upward!! <3

<p>RaisingRaj Campaign is about creating and supporting various health, environmental, creative, entrepreneurial and society improving fundraising benefits. RaisingRaj is a charitable event planning company that thrives off of supporting foundations and causes who thrive off of supporting our communities around the nation! Our purpose is to create and curate any type of fundraising event that will benefit a specific cause at hand or support any charitable foundation. As a young company we intend to  embark on all avenues of planning however for now our main focus is putting together Los Angeles’s most memorable fundraisers you have ever attended.</p>

<p align=""center""><strong>Raj’s Story</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this fundraiser is to support a special cause that is very dear to me. My son Josiah Raj Michael was born at 6 months (26 weeks) weighing 2 pounds 3 ounces at birth. During a regularly scheduled doctors visit, I learned that my ultrasound results confirmed my 21 in a half week old fetus’s foot was sticking out of my uterus and into my birth canal, I was immediately hospitalized. After three in a half weeks of restricted bed rest, laying in Trendelenburg position my water broke leaving my son and I exposed to a high risk of bacterial and viral infections. Due to doctors concerns of him being delivered at such an early age they did what they could to keep him from delivering.  We were subject to constant monitoring of red and white blood cell counts and testing for harmful bacterium in the remaining amniotic fluid. Josiah had managed to stay in for another 5 days, without showing any signs of distress. At 26 weeks on the dot which, doctors were pushing for, he was delivered by way of caesarean. He spent two months in the NICU before he could come home to develop in a normal environment. Undergoing strenuous breathing treatments due to his lungs being underdeveloped, a series of blood transfusions because he could not produce blood cells on his own at such a young age, and constant organ testing, was the most helpless feeling and experience that a parent could face. For most of those who know him would never imagine that this would be his beginning story through his journey of life. At 16 months Josiah is healthy and growing strong.  My family and I got to witness what most do not and got to see many families who shared similar but not as fortunate fate. The blessing of life and undergoing such a trying experience is the force behind RaisingRaj.</p>

THE PRIZE:I have decided to sell the t-shirts I made for last year's Supercrawl (2013) in Hamilton, ON:  http://www.supercrawl.ca/Summertime is here...At Last!  And everyone could use an extra t-shirt for this season!  Whether its a shirt to wear in the heat, or a shirt to wear while doing yard work or landscaping.  Maybe there's a garage to clean out this summer, or maybe an automobile to do some work on.  Or maybe its a shirt to wear in the studio while you make a mess of your clothes.  Whatever the job, I've got just the t-shirt for you!As part of the project I built for Supercrawl, I also did a collaboration with Becky Katz to create these t-shirts I'm offering.  The shirts were screenprinted at Centre 3 (http://centre3.com/centre3upgradesite/).  The t-shirts are in both black and white, with an image of a pentagon and triangle screen printed on the front; the form is a reference to the shape of the structure I built for Supercrawl.  Each screenprinted image differs slightly.  T-shirts are only in Medium and Large, and people who make a donation of $45 - $55 will receive a t-shirt while they are still available!I will also be making original photo collages available in postcard format (4""X 6"") through out this funding campaign (which ends June 30th).  Each week there will be a new collage to choose from, with varying funding incentives.The ImpactThe impact is simple:  Give people more opportunities to express themselves creatively - and to interact with their reality on a creative level - and see what good comes from it!Ways to HelpMaybe you don't want a t-shirt, but know someone who would like it as a gift.  Or, if you can't make a contribution, but feel this is a worthwhile effort to support, then feel free to copy the URL to this page and forward it to your friends.  Please help me spread the word if you support my project!  Thank you.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

São  tipos diferentes de opressão (a do Estado e a da religião ) , mas que se manifestam de forma semelhante : o controle da identidade das pessoas.
Um projeto que questiona:as identidades oficiais  redutoras,os códigos de conduta,a categorização de pessoas,os catálogos de rostos,a vigilância e a censura.

</p><p>It is a Burning Man-style temple, with the unique vibe and limitations of Nowhere taken into account. Inspired in its design philosophy amongst others by the architectures of Catalhuyuk, by African kasbahs, by Mesoamerican kivas, and by ascending and descending staircases. Influenced and built with wind/air and earth as its core elements. A decentred experience that celebrates Nowhere's decentred community. </p><p>The <i>Temple of Ascension</i> is a visual, a sensory, a tactile and a very participatory experience. The structure itself provides a secluded oasis, or experience in itself, on the Nowhere festival grounds. Different compartments invite to be climbed onto and into, to experience, and meditate. Differently pitched wind chimes that create unique atmospheres in each compartment. The rooftops as places of relaxation, with possibility of encounters, and integral ritual parts of the temple.

That means that traditional Burn-temple practice - in which participants leave pictures, messages, drawings and other things in the temple to be burned and thereby ""letting go"" of these things - doesn't work. We have devised a practice in which participants can write their messages or drawings in sand. A participant ascends the <i>Temple of Ascension</i> and then descends into a compartment. In these compartments, there are containers and mounds of sand, for the participants to use. A participant can spend time in the compartment, meditate, listen to the soothing sounds of the wind chime, and then ascend with their own container of sand. On the rooftops, there are small stone ""shrines"", that invite participants to create their own sand canvas, to write or draw their personal message on. That sand will slowly trickle through the ceiling of the compartment, onto the wind chime. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">At the end of the week, all the trickled-down sand will be gathered in a closing ceremony. In this ceremony, we will gift all this sand back to the earth and to the wind. </span></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/445673/files/20140319131551-temple_of_ascension_-_impression_of_rooftops.jpg?1395260151"" src="""" style=""width: 468.2536585365853px; height: 338px;""/> <br/></b></p><p><b>WHY BUILD A ""CATALHUYUK/KASBAH/KIVA"" SAND CASTLE-ISH TEMPLE?</b></p>
<p>Burn events are powerful emotional and spiritual experiences for most participants. Most of them need a place to reflect on their lives and their souls. Their past, present and future. Their thoughts, hopes and dreams. To leave stuff behind. To grow as human beings. A temple facilitates that. The <i>Temple of Ascension </i>will facilitate that. Humbled and thrilled by last year's experience of the Temple of Dissolution, we would like to gift another temple experience to the Nowhere community. An experience that is even more immersive. More powerful. More unique. We hope and expect that with your contribution, we can make that happen! </p><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>WE NEED YOUR HELP!</h3><p>The <i>Temple of Ascension</i> is a big structure. The total footprint of the temple is approximately 12 metres by 12 metres. The different compartments vary in height, from 2,5 metres to 5 metres high. As you can see in the picture below, the entire structure will be built with a wooden structural core, with sand-drenched burlap walls [not shown]. To ensure safety and structural integrity of the temple, we can not cut corners, especially not for a structure that needs to withstand a week in the Monegros desert climate, with participants climbing the structure and being on the rooftops. </p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/446968/files/20140320024601-temple_of_ascension_-_sketch__8_structural.jpg?1395308761"" src="""" style=""width: 473.8434782608696px; height: 342px;""/></span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">So, to realize our vision comes at a price.

None of the crew will benefit financially in any form. We buy our own tickets, we pay for our own transport, and we pay for an extra week of survival in Monegros pre-event to build the <i>Temple of Ascension</i>.

ALTHOUGH WE HAVEN'T COME NEAR OUR FUNDING GOAL, WE ARE BRINGING A TEMPLE TO NOWHERE, SMALL AND HUMBLE, INSPIRED BY THE ORIGINAL DESIGN. STILL WANT TO CONTRIBUTE TO THAT EFFORT? THEN YOU CAN DIRECTLY SEND A DONATION VIA PAYPAL TO: ARLO@AWOFILM.NLTHE TEMPLE OF ASCENSION
 IN SHORTThe Temple of Ascension is a sacred space, that facilitates and celebrates an experience of spirituality and mourning or letting go, but also wonderment and playfulness for the participants of Nowhere, Europe's regional Burn event.
It is a Burning Man-style temple, with the unique vibe and limitations of Nowhere taken into account. Inspired in its design philosophy amongst others by the architectures of Catalhuyuk, by African kasbahs, by Mesoamerican kivas, and by ascending and descending staircases. Influenced and built with wind/air and earth as its core elements. A decentred experience that celebrates Nowhere's decentred community. The Temple of Ascension is a visual, a sensory, a tactile and a very participatory experience. The structure itself provides a secluded oasis, or experience in itself, on the Nowhere festival grounds. Different compartments invite to be climbed onto and into, to experience, and meditate. Differently pitched wind chimes that create unique atmospheres in each compartment. The rooftops as places of relaxation, with possibility of encounters, and integral ritual parts of the temple. Because...not only does the Temple resemble a sand castle, but its practice is ""sandy"" as well! LETTING GO IN THE TEMPLE OF ASCENSIONNowhere is a ""non-Burn"" Burn event. That means that traditional Burn-temple practice - in which participants leave pictures, messages, drawings and other things in the temple to be burned and thereby ""letting go"" of these things - doesn't work. We have devised a practice in which participants can write their messages or drawings in sand. A participant ascends the Temple of Ascension and then descends into a compartment. In these compartments, there are containers and mounds of sand, for the participants to use. A participant can spend time in the compartment, meditate, listen to the soothing sounds of the wind chime, and then ascend with their own container of sand. On the rooftops, there are small stone ""shrines"", that invite participants to create their own sand canvas, to write or draw their personal message on. That sand will slowly trickle through the ceiling of the compartment, onto the wind chime. At the end of the week, all the trickled-down sand will be gathered in a closing ceremony. In this ceremony, we will gift all this sand back to the earth and to the wind.  WHY BUILD A ""CATALHUYUK/KASBAH/KIVA"" SAND CASTLE-ISH TEMPLE?
Burn events are powerful emotional and spiritual experiences for most participants. Most of them need a place to reflect on their lives and their souls. Their past, present and future. Their thoughts, hopes and dreams. To leave stuff behind. To grow as human beings. A temple facilitates that. The Temple of Ascension will facilitate that. Humbled and thrilled by last year's experience of the Temple of Dissolution, we would like to gift another temple experience to the Nowhere community. An experience that is even more immersive. More powerful. More unique. We hope and expect that with your contribution, we can make that happen! WE NEED YOUR HELP!The Temple of Ascension is a big structure. The total footprint of the temple is approximately 12 metres by 12 metres. The different compartments vary in height, from 2,5 metres to 5 metres high. As you can see in the picture below, the entire structure will be built with a wooden structural core, with sand-drenched burlap walls [not shown]. To ensure safety and structural integrity of the temple, we can not cut corners, especially not for a structure that needs to withstand a week in the Monegros desert climate, with participants climbing the structure and being on the rooftops. So, to realize our vision comes at a price. To build the temple as proposed in the above drawings and transport it to and from Nowhere, we will need a total amount of around € 10,000.- [ten thousand euros]. None of the crew will benefit financially in any form. We buy our own tickets, we pay for our own transport, and we pay for an extra week of survival in Monegros pre-event to build the Temple of Ascension. Gifting our soul, time, and energy in creating this temple. All the money is for materials and transport.This breaks down like this:

Structural wood [framework, enforcing beams in framework, plywood coverings for ceilings and safe wall coverings on top level, ceiling beams, safety railings on top of the compartments]: € 4974.85


Burlap wall coverings: € 836.55


Rounded and half rounded lumber for ladders: € 902.00


Material for five wind chimes, including rigging: € 825.00


Construction hardware [fasteners; screws, nuts, bolts, washers, etc.]: € 550.00


Lighting: € 550.00


Transport [truck cargo transport to/from Nowhere; 5 tons of material]: € 2145.00

Grand total: € 10,783.40We have already secured a wholesaler discount of around 10 percent for all the wood, which will make the total costs around € 10,000.- But then there's Indiegogo and Paypal fees. Up to 10%. So, we are talking about € 11,000.-, of which a small amount will be covered by the regular Nowhere art grant of € 750.

</div></div>","Welcome everyone,
My name is Lawrence Beckx and I am here to introduce you MUUGI.
Meet MUUGI
MUUGI is an exploration
in 3D-printing technology in combination with my personal pursuits in art and
design – now brought to
you as unique sculptures for interior decoration. 

It’s printed using a high quality laser sintering printer and comes in a white polyamide material. It has a slight wood like grain to its appearance and is unpolished which gives it quite a gritty velvety texture.
Design of MUUGI
The visual style of MUUGI
extends from a representational style of art developed in my paintings.
I was always fascinated with
complex patterns beautifully sculpted by mother-nature, expressing a
mathematical (Fibonacci) sequence in their design which is found all throughout
our micro and macro universe, including within our bodies.
MUUGI & golden ratio human body 



This connection is
something I often symbolize in my art using the reoccurring visual theme of
Horns, which is also presented in MUUGI's design.
Now, with the advancements in
3D-printing technology, I am able to materialize my personal style of design into
actual objects in reality. This I find incredibly revolutionary!

3D printing technology really
opens so many new possibilities in art and design and also new convenient ways
to share art.
Just the tip of the
iceberg

MUUGI has been quite a
challenge and quite a journey. A great deal of time and costs were invested in
design hours, in prototyping, printing, service, handling, raw materials, and
computer upgrades.
With your help I can explore
so much more!

There are loads more exciting
materials I would love to work with, such as bronze, stainless steel, titanium,
etc. Ultimately affording my own 3D-printer would significantly reduce costs
and time. Experimenting would be much more rapid and practical. Helping me to
discover and play with new ideas in creating more designs and possibly
in larger sizes.

Intersections Media Opportunities for Youth Society is a non-profit organization that offers an employability and life skills workshop and work experience opportunity to youth facing multiple barriers to employment.
Through the unique and familiar medium of art and digital filmmaking, and by participating in group-based projects, Intersections' participants gain the experience and confidence for long-term attachment to the workforce.  Over a one year season, Intersections services 48 youth, divided into 8 intakes with 6 youth per intake.  HELP YOUTH PAINT!Besides filmmaking, a significant part of the program is about dipping our hands into the visual art/creative process and into art history by creating art work that interprets the masters and that creates community dialogue.Our mandate this year is for each intake to create a 5' x 12' painting that interprets a master.  Our latest 2 paintings interpreted Frida Kahlo's The Two Fridas...and Manet's Olympia through the flavor of Basquiat:The artwork is a collaborative effort providing local businesses and organizations with art work to enhance their offices and events.  The art is a component of Intersections' Digital Short Project.  We have already created art for a variety of organizations including YouthCO, BC Schizophrenia Society, and North Shore Restorative Justice Society.  The process provides us with the opportunity to work as a team and to learn valuable employment skills such as project management and client services. Most importantly, it is incredibly fun and rewarding!  But we need your help!  We have used up ALL OUR PAINT.  ALL OUR CANVAS.  We have literally scraped the bottom of the barrel.  And the barrel is empty!  For only $500, we will be able to provide enough high quality supplies for our next 2 intakes at our program in order to create two new masterpieces and to continue to build client relationships.  Our end goal is that in Spring 2015 we gather all the art work created this season in an exhibit that showcases 8 large canvas (5' x 12' each).     What We Need & What You Get 
As mentioned: $500 will provide us with enough high quality supplies for two intakes. 

Supply list: 24 feet of canvas (60"" wide), mural paint, brushes, gesso, china markers, newsprint, We have opted for flexible funding and if we do not reach our entire goal, we will buy as many supplies as possible (hopefully not Dollar store quality).

<h2>SHOOTING HOOPS: HELP GET MY UNIQUE PHOTO COLLECTION DISPLAYED AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN</h2>
<h2>A story of basketball obsession</h2>
<p><strong>Shooting Hoops</strong> is a quest to get my photo's of New York City basketball hoops displayed at the sports spiritual home - Madison Square Garden.</p>
<p>My dream is to have the world's most famous arena display my unique photo collection under the slogan ""Over 700 courts in New York City.  Only ONE Madison Square Garden.""</p>
<h3>Who/What/Why???</h3>
<p>My name is Thai Neave.  I'm a former ESPN International SportsCenter Host who is combining my passion for photography with my love of basketball in New York City. </p>
<p>After playing basketball since I was 12 years old, I started to look at hoops a little differently when I arrived in New York City to begin my position with ESPN.  I discovered that there was much more to a hoop than a cylinder ring and a rectangle backboard.  In fact, the more I found and looked and wandered aimlessly through Manhattan with my camera, the more I realized that each one had a distinct and beautiful life of its own.</p>
<p>My compulsive journey has taken me down nearly every street in Manhattan and after 18 months - through rain and snow and almost getting arrested on numerous occassions - I've amassed a rather unique collection.  From hoops that sprout out of vivid graffiti, to rusted rings that are nestled under the canopy of Manhattan buildings, to dilapidated basketball courts where you would least expect them, each image gives a distinct perspective of my favorite city in the world:  The seasons change, people come and go, buildings and skyscrapers emerge, but the hoops remain proudly untouched, anchored to the concrete, awaiting nothing more than a ball to play with.    </p>
<p>Now the time has come to share <strong>SHOOTING HOOPS</strong> with the city, and what better place than at Madison Square Garden. </p>
<p>Beyond this dream, I'm also looking to begin a collaboration with one of the major sporting brands to work on a <strong>SHOOTING HOOPS </strong>T-Shirt Series and create a coffee table book.</p>
<p>Ultimately this isn't about making money:  <strong>SHOOTING HOOPS</strong> is about getting what I feel is a unique perspective of New York City on display in the world's most famous and awe inspiring arena.</p>
<h2>When???</h2>
<p>Before the New York Knicks 2012/2013 regular season.  I need to hustle!</p>
<h2>How you can help??? </h2>
<strong>If you're an art/photography/basketball/New York City lover then my campaign could really use your help.</strong>   <br/><p><strong>Funding will support with the following:</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Help me remain based in Manhattan to establish contact with marketing/creative directors at Madison Square Garden and continue expanding my <strong>SHOOTING HOOPS</strong> collection.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Pay for the rental of a helicopter to take aerial photos of courts </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Attract attention from major sporting brands such as Nike, Adidas, Reebok, Converse for potential Shooting Hoops T-Shirt series</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Gain attention from NBA stars/Basketball fanatics for installing feature walls of my work (For some reason I've always believed Spike Lee and Steve Nash will want a feature wall in their Manhattan Pads)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Attract publishers for coffee table book ""Shooting Hoops""</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Get MOMA to knock on my door for an exhibit (I can dream can't I?! But seriously, I saw a feature wall once in MOMA of different manholes around the city - SHOOTING HOOPS has far greater interest don't you think?)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>Apart from direct funding: </h2>
<p>I would really love any advice, support, mentoring, contacts, marketing strategies, networking, general help I can get.  </p>
<p>Even if you just think what I'm doing is cool or you want to just say hi, please do.  You don't have to only help out with $$$, by simply sharing this campaign and my video link, you are showing your support.  One thing I have learn't from all the amazing people I have met in New York City is that we can all help pave the way for  creative paths simply through the art of connecting each other.  </p>
<h2>What I'll be spending on???</h2>
<ul>
<li>Shooting photos of more hoops in greater New York i.e. the Bronx, New Jersey, Brooklyn</li>
<li>Rental of helicopter for aerial perspectives</li>
<li>Renting ladders for different perspective shots </li>

<h2><strong>The Impact...</strong></h2>
<p>From the thousands of people who play streetball to those that make millions representing the New York Knicks, everyone has at one time or another stared up at a basketball hoop and admired it's simplicity.  Now it's time to show the world that Basketball hoops are as part of New York City as it's skyscrapers, Time Square, and the Statue of liberty.     </p>

<h2><b>BEN
PATTERSON </b></h2>
<p>Patterson
wurde 1934 in Pittsburgh (USA) geboren und lebt heute in Wiesbaden. Von 1952
bis 1956 studierte er Musik an der University of Michigan. Danach spielte er
als Kontrabassist in verschiedenen Symphonie-Orchestern. 1960 zog er nach Köln,
wo er eine aktive Rolle in der Neue-Musik-Szene im Umfeld des Ateliers von Mary
Bauermeister übernahm. Während dieser Zeit schrieb er auch Stücke wie die <i>VARIATIONS FOR DOUBLE-BASS</i> (1961) und <i>PAPER PIECE</i> (1960), die zu
Fluxus-Klassikern wurden und häufig bei Fluxus-Konzerten performt wurden, das
letztere bis heute. 1961 stellte Patterson gemeinsam mit Robert Filliou seine
<i>Puzzle Poems</i> in Paris aus. 1962 nahm er an allen wichtigen frühen
Fluxus-Ereignissen teil wie z.B. <i>Kleines
Sommerfest: Après John Cage</i> in Wuppertal, <i>Neo-Dada in der Musik</i> in Düsseldorf, die <i>SNEAK PREVIEW: fluxus, happenings, environement, poèmes, danses,
compositions</i> in Paris und die <i>Fluxus-Internationale
Festspiele Neuester Musik</i> in Wiesbaden. 1963 kehrte er in die USA zurück,
wo er zunächst als Bibliothekar arbeitete und bis 1967 eine aktive Rolle bei
Fluxus spielte. </p>
<p>Danach zog
er sich bis 1988 von der Kunstwelt zurück und arbeitete als Manager und
Direktor verschiedener Kulturinstitutionen. 1988 wurde eine Ausstellung seiner
Arbeiten in der Emily Harvey Gallery in New York gezeigt. Seit dieser Zeit nahm
er an zahlreichen Ausstellungen und Performances teil. 2004 – zu seinem 70.
Geburtstag – reiste er mit der transsibirischen Eisenbahn durch Russland, die
Mongolei und China – und erreichte schließlich Japan, mit verschiedenen
Zwischenstopps und Performances. 2010 wurde erstmals die größere Retrospektive <i>Ben Patterson. In the State of Fluxus</i> im
Contemporary Arts Museum Houston und 2012 im Nassauischen Kunstverein Wiesbaden
gezeigt. 2012 erhielt er den Kulturpreis der Stadt Wiesbaden und war Pate der
Feierlichkeiten zum 50. Jahrestag von Fluxus. Im gleichen Jahr erschien
erstmals eine ausführliche Zusammenstellung seiner Partituren <i>Ben Patterson. Event Scores</i>.</p>
<h2><b>WER WIR SIND</b></h2>
<p>Bill Dietz ist
Komponist und künstlerischer Leiter des Ensemble Zwischentöne. Seitdem er die
Leitung der Zwischentöne 2007 übernahm, trat das Ensemble an sehr
unterschiedlichen Orten auf vom Hamburger Bahnhof in Berlin, den Straßen von
Aarhus, Dänemark bishin zum Wohnzimmer der Sammlung Hoffmann und performte neue
Werke von Künstlern wie Marina Rosenfeld, Rolf Julius und Chris Newman. </p>
<p>Christian
Kesten und die Maulwerker führten eine Reihe von Fluxus-Konzerten auf – im
Hamburger Bahnhof, Berlin; Museo Reina Sofia, Madrid; Fridericianum, Kassel; MUMOK,
Wien; ZKM, Karlsruhe und an vielen anderen Orten – zusammen mit Emmett
Williams und Ann Noël (1999-2007), Alison Knowles (2008) und Ben Patterson
(2012).</p>
<p>Petra
Stegmann kuratierte die Ausstellungen <i>FLUXUS EAST</i> (Künstlerhaus Bethanien,
Berlin; CAC, Vilnius; Bunkier Sztuki, Krakau; Ludwig Museum, Budapest; Kumu,
Tallinn; Nikolaj Kunsthal, Copenhagen; Henie Onstad Kunstsenter, Oslo) und
<i>""The lunatics are on the loose ..."" EUROPEAN FLUXUS FESTIVALS
1962-1977</i> (u.a. Akademie der Künste, Berlin; MOCAK, Krakau; Staatsgalerie Stuttgart)
und veröffentlichte viel über Fluxus und Aktionskunst.</p>

Fluxus-Klassikern wurden und häufig bei Fluxus-Konzerten performt wurden, das
letztere bis heute. 1961 stellte Patterson gemeinsam mit Robert Filliou seine
Puzzle Poems in Paris aus. 1962 nahm er an allen wichtigen frühen
Fluxus-Ereignissen teil wie z.B. Kleines
Sommerfest: Après John Cage in Wuppertal, Neo-Dada in der Musik in Düsseldorf, die SNEAK PREVIEW: fluxus, happenings, environement, poèmes, danses,
compositions in Paris und die Fluxus-Internationale
Festspiele Neuester Musik in Wiesbaden. 1963 kehrte er in die USA zurück,
wo er zunächst als Bibliothekar arbeitete und bis 1967 eine aktive Rolle bei
Fluxus spielte. 
Danach zog
er sich bis 1988 von der Kunstwelt zurück und arbeitete als Manager und
Direktor verschiedener Kulturinstitutionen. 1988 wurde eine Ausstellung seiner
Arbeiten in der Emily Harvey Gallery in New York gezeigt. Seit dieser Zeit nahm
er an zahlreichen Ausstellungen und Performances teil. 2004 – zu seinem 70.
Geburtstag – reiste er mit der transsibirischen Eisenbahn durch Russland, die
Mongolei und China – und erreichte schließlich Japan, mit verschiedenen
Zwischenstopps und Performances. 2010 wurde erstmals die größere Retrospektive Ben Patterson. In the State of Fluxus im
Contemporary Arts Museum Houston und 2012 im Nassauischen Kunstverein Wiesbaden
gezeigt. 2012 erhielt er den Kulturpreis der Stadt Wiesbaden und war Pate der
Feierlichkeiten zum 50. Jahrestag von Fluxus. Im gleichen Jahr erschien
erstmals eine ausführliche Zusammenstellung seiner Partituren Ben Patterson. Event Scores.
WER WIR SIND
Bill Dietz ist

</h3><p></p><p><span>CounterPulse provides space and resources for emerging performing artists and cultural innovators, serving as an incubator for the creation of socially relevant, community-based art and culture.

History repeats itself, and we find ourselves smack dab in the middle of another tech boom, meaning change is happening fast and space is at a premium. The lease on our current space is up and fortunately we’ve found <a href=""http://counterpulse.org/new-home/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an affordable new location</a> that just needs some work to become a full-fledged performing arts facility.</span></p><p></p><h3>A Groundbreaking Moment</h3>We are now at a tipping point where your support can be a catalyst in the success not only of CounterPulse, but of a radical new real-estate development model for arts organizations in the Bay Area and beyond. We’re working with the Community Arts Stabilization Trust (CAST) to renovate a run-down former porn theater and turn it into a vibrant center for art and community. The building will then become a permanent venue for performing artists [seriously, there is a deed restriction on the property for arts and culture use ONLY].

The jobs created by a booming tech sector have attracted many new residents, putting extreme pressure on the real estate market. Nonprofits are losing their spaces and artists are losing their homes. These changes make for uncertain times. Without a concerted effort by local residents to support arts nonprofits, we’re at risk of losing our thriving cultural sector and pushing out the marginalized communities that we’ve long supported.</span></p>We need a new model to help stabilize the arts and bolster the resources needed for artists to continue creating in San Francisco. We want to prove that our new model for arts stabilization works.<br/><p></p><p><span>CounterPulse has a track record of identifying artists who are ready to be appreciated by a larger audience, and have been recognized as a vital incubator of new performance in the Bay Area.

Thanks to your support, now we can reach further to make the new CounterPulse a dream for artists and audiences alike. Adding to the Twitter match, the Zendesk contribution marks another endorsement by a local tech company that values space for experimental performing arts in San Francisco.We’re now past a tipping point. If we carry this forward, we will realize our dream of advancing the technical capacity of our theater by creating a state-of-the-art home for artistic experimentation.Indiegogo is acting on this exciting news by extending our campaign deadline to midnight on Monday, November 3rd. We now have 4 more days to stretch for upgraded, energy-efficient, adaptable LED lighting equipment for our new theater and studio. Help us get there!Stretch Perk Unveiled: The Dollhouse Dancer ToteThis limited edition Dollhouse tote pays homage to the former incarnation of our new home at 80 Turk Street, featuring the dancer silhouettes that are currently in the front windows of the building.




You helped us meet the $10,000 Art and Tech Match!

We are beside ourselves with excitement and filled with gratitude that our generous funders have fully met the $10,000 Art and Tech Match pledged by our DJ pals from Honey Soundsystem and our tech-savvy neighbors at Twitter!This is the kind of collaboration between art and tech that will create the San Francisco we want to live in, where innovation drives our cultural dialogue as well as our technology. And it has brought our goal within reach. Please consider making a contribution and share the news so that we can ride this wave to success!Assumption Shattering Performance
CounterPulse provides space and resources for emerging performing artists and cultural innovators, serving as an incubator for the creation of socially relevant, community-based art and culture. Since 1991, we have supported the vanguard of Bay Area performing artists in shattering audience assumptions, creating meaning, and deepening dialogue.The Little Theater That CouldWe weathered the first San Francisco tech boom (and bust), the Great Recession, and in fact, grew our organization when others struggled to survive. History repeats itself, and we find ourselves smack dab in the middle of another tech boom, meaning change is happening fast and space is at a premium. The lease on our current space is up and fortunately we’ve found an affordable new location that just needs some work to become a full-fledged performing arts facility.A Groundbreaking MomentWe are now at a tipping point where your support can be a catalyst in the success not only of CounterPulse, but of a radical new real-estate development model for arts organizations in the Bay Area and beyond. We’re working with the Community Arts Stabilization Trust (CAST) to renovate a run-down former porn theater and turn it into a vibrant center for art and community. The building will then become a permanent venue for performing artists [seriously, there is a deed restriction on the property for arts and culture use ONLY]. We’re about to break ground and we need your help to make our vision a reality.Help Us Cross The Finish Line
We’ve raised $1.2 million of the $1.3 million we need to break ground and begin renovations. The money we raise with this Indiegogo campaign will allow to us install much needed lighting, sound, and video equipment in the theater.

Dimmer Packs
$20,000.00
Power source for theatrical lighting


Lighting Accessories
$8,000.00
Hardware for rigging instruments, gels, and gel frames


Audio Speakers
$13,000.00
Surround sound speaker array and power supply


Audio Equipment
$4,000.00
Audio mixer, amp, and power supply


Video & Projection Equipment
$5,000.00
Upgraded projector, control station, associated cables, and adapters

The ImpactSan Francisco is experiencing rapid change. The jobs created by a booming tech sector have attracted many new residents, putting extreme pressure on the real estate market. Nonprofits are losing their spaces and artists are losing their homes. These changes make for uncertain times. Without a concerted effort by local residents to support arts nonprofits, we’re at risk of losing our thriving cultural sector and pushing out the marginalized communities that we’ve long supported.We need a new model to help stabilize the arts and bolster the resources needed for artists to continue creating in San Francisco. We want to prove that our new model for arts stabilization works.CounterPulse has a track record of identifying artists who are ready to be appreciated by a larger audience, and have been recognized as a vital incubator of new performance in the Bay Area. In the past year, CounterPulse has supported 2,026 artists in the presentation of 295 events to more than 15,000 audience members. CounterPulse has been named ""Best Hybrid Performance Venue” (2007) by the San Francisco Weekly, “Best Performance Space” (2010 & 2013) by the San Francisco Bay Guardian, “Best of Nightlife: Performance Art” (2012) by 7x7 Magazine, “Top Nonprofit” (2010 & 2012) by Philanthropedia and the honored beneficiary of the San Francisco Bay Guardian GOLDIES Awards Party (2014).This move to a newly renovated building will allow us to increase our impact in the following key areas:This Will Perk You Up!To show our gratitude for your support, we've whipped up a fresh design for our CounterPulse T-shirts and totes.

$15,000 or even $20,000. Right now we are trying to raise $5000  
to offset these legal fees.  Any funds collected over and above the

SAVE THE SPACE- at 25 Main!

					

The School for Contemporary Dance & Thought (SCDT) has joined forces
with the Northeast American School of Dance to secure the studio that has
been in our community since 1980! You can help save the last remaining
large space for dance and theater in Northampton.

Northampton has long been recognized for its progressive outlook and creative
enterprise. But with each passing year, the diminishing availability of affordable space
for artists endangers that reputation. As countless studies have shown, this trend, if
continued, could have social and economic repercussions for our broader community
beyond the arts.

Our goal is to get 200 people to



~ Give $20 and get 4 friends to give $20 ~ 
We have already unexpectedly had to spend almost $10,000 on legal fees 
and, though we expect to win the case, the fees are expected to reach 
$15,000 or even $20,000. Right now we are trying to raise $5000  
to offset these legal fees.  Any funds collected over and above the 
legal fees will be spent on much needed improvements to the space.""
