</h3><p> </p><p>Growing up, I (Randall) accepted these type of negative suggestions from my environment, and it led me to a path of turmoil, substance abuse, violence, and aggression in my teens, and the music I listened to reinforced that identity. One night, I was fortunate to hear a song that told me a different story--that I was much more than what I had been living, that I had a purpose and was worthy to live a better life. It broke me down. I listened to that song over and over and over, allowing it to repeat all night while I slept. When I awoke the next morning, my trajectory had completely changed. And then my life changed. It was then that I began to realize the awesome power of music, and I wanted to be a part of that.

<h3>ACERCA DE MÍ</h3>
<p>Mi nombre es Camila Pérez y nací en Guayaquil, Ecuador. La música ha estado en mi sangre desde que nací, y se convirtió en mi pasión a los 3 años cuando comencé a cantar, en mi refugio a los 12 años cuando comencé a componer, y oficialmente en mi profesión a los 18 años cuando la escogí como carrera.</p>
<p>A lo largo de todos estos años de estudio, he acumulado experiencias, aprendizajes y nuevas perspectivas que me han llevado a evolucionar, a encontrar mi propia voz, y finalmente a definir mi identidad y mi propósito como artista y como persona. Hoy mi música no busca impresionar, exhibir, o demostrar virtuosismo. Lo que busca es conmover, inspirar, invitarte a sentir y conectarte, a cuestionarte y reinventarte. Busca ofrecer una visión auténtica de la vida en la que el reconocimiento de tus errores y defectos son medallas de valentía. </p>
<p>Fue aquí en Barcelona donde mis composiciones tomaron forma y vida propia en manos de algunos de los músicos más increíbles que he tenido el orgullo de conocer, y hoy pienso cumplir mi sueño de grabar mi <strong>primer álbum</strong> como cantautora con estos artistas de primera en esta maravillosa ciudad. Y para lograrlo, necesito de tu ayuda financiera. </p>
<p>Este proyecto es importante para mí no solamente porque marca un nuevo comienzo en mi carrera musical, sino porque me llena de ilusión y orgullo el poder contribuir al desarrollo cultural y artístico de mi país. <strong>Aspiro a convertirme en una de las voces que representen todo lo que mi tierra tiene para ofrecer</strong>; la calidez de su gente, la riqueza de su cultura, y el orgullo que sentimos de ser ecuatorianos ‒ y este es el primer paso. Es momento de llegar más lejos, darnos a conocer, y alcanzar nuevas metas... juntos.</p>
<p>Quiero agradecer de antemano a todas las personas que decidan formar parte de esta campaña, y todas aquellas que visiten esta página, compartan, y me apoyen a mí y a mi música de cualquier manera que les sea posible. ¡Gracias infinitas!</p>
<h3>LO QUE NECESITO</h3>
<p>Como habrán notado, la meta de esta campaña es de $12,000 que serán destinados a:</p>
<ul>
<li>Estudio de grabación</li>
<li>Honorarios de los músicos</li>
<li>Mezcla y masterización</li>
<li>Arte gráfico (fotografía y diseño de la portada)</li>
<li>Impresión del disco</li>
<li>Costos de distribución</li>
<li>Costos de promoción</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sin embargo, </strong>es importante mencionar que, como toda plataforma de crowdfunding, <i>Indiegogo </i>se quedará con un porcentaje de los fondos recaudados, incluso si alcanzamos la meta o no. Por este motivo, lo ideal es sobrepasar la meta proyectada (lo cual es permitido e incentivado), y todo el dinero ""extra"" recaudado también formará parte de la producción del disco, particularmente para impulsar las estrategias de promoción y cubrir sus respectivos gastos.</p>
<h3>LO QUE OBTENDRÁS</h3>
<p>Lo que más me gusta de <i>Indiegogo</i> es que me permite ofrecerte algo a cambio por tu ayuda, y dependiendo de la cantidad que contribuyas, puedes obtener una gran variedad de recompensas que he preparado con muchísimo cariño para todos ustedes, como por ejemplo:</p>
<ul>
<li>Una copia del disco físico firmado y con dedicatoria personalizada.</li>
<li>Kits con la línea gráfica del disco y regalos personalizados como las letras escritas a mano, pintadas por mí, y enmarcadas.</li>
<li>Clases de canto (presenciales o vía Skype)</li>

<li>Y (mi favorita) una canción hecha por mí para ti o para alguien que amas a base de alguna historia, escrito, poema, o idea tuya que quisieras musicalizar.</li>

<h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
<p>My name is Camila Pérez and I'm from Guayaquil, Ecuador. Music has been in my blood since I was born, and it became my passion when I was 3 years old when I started singing, my refuge when I was 12 when I started to write songs, and officially my profession when I was 18 when I chose it as a career.</p>
<p>Throughout all these years of study, I have accumulated experiences, life lessons and new perspectives that have led me to evolve, to find my own voice, and finally to define my identity and my purpose as an artist and as a person. Today, my music does not seek to impress, exhibit, or demonstrate virtuosity. It seeks is to move, inspire, invite you to feel and connect, to question and reinvent yourself. It seeks to offer an authentic vision of life, in which the admission of your mistakes and flaws are medals of courage.</p>
<p>It was here in Barcelona where my compositions took shape and came to life in the hands of some of the most incredible musicians I've had the honor to know and work with, and today I plan to fulfill my dream of recording my <strong>first album</strong> as a singer-songwriter with these first-class artists in this wonderful city. And to make it happen, I need your financial help.</p>
<p>This project is important to me not only because it marks a new beginning in my musical career, but because it fills me with excitement and pride to be able to contribute to the cultural and artistic development of my country. <strong>I aspire to become one of the voices that represent everything my country has to offer</strong>; the warmth of its people, the richness of its culture, and the pride of being Ecuadorian ‒ and this is the first step. It's time to go further, to make ourselves known to the world, and reach new goals... together.</p>
<p>I want to thank in advance all the people who decide to be part of this campaign, and all those who visit this page, share, and support me and my music in any way possible. Infinite thanks!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>WHAT I NEED</h3>
<p>As you may have noticed, the goal of this campaign is $12,000, which will be destined to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recording studio</li>
<li>Musicians' fees</li>
<li>Mixing and mastering</li>
<li>CD cover artwork and photographer </li>
<li>CD replication</li>
<li>Distribution costs</li>
<li>Promotion expenses</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>However</strong>, it is important to mention that, like any crowdfunding platform, <i>Indiegogo </i>will keep a percentage of the funds raised, whether the goal is reached or not. For this reason, it's best aiming to exceed the projected goal (which is allowed and encouraged), and all the ""extra"" money collected will also be destined to the production and post-production of the album, particularly to fuel the promotion strategies and cover its costs.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>WHAT YOU GET</h3>
<p>What I like most about <i>Indiegogo</i> is that it allows me to give you something in return for your help, and depending on the amount you contribute, you can pick among a variety of perks that I have prepared for all of you with lots of love, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>A signed hard copy of the album, and with a personalized note just for you.</li>
<li>Tote-bag kits with the album's design and filled with personalized gifts such as handwritten lyrics, painted by me, and framed.</li>
<li>Singing lessons (face-to-face or via Skype)</li>
<li>Private concerts.</li>
<li>And (my favorite) a song written by me for you, or for someone you love, based on a story, poem, or idea of ​​yours that you would like to turn into music.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that, if you prefer it, you can also contribute with donations without claiming a perk in exchange for them.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</h3>
<p>Like any project, carrying out this initiative involves some risks:</p>
<ul>
<li>As I was saying, <i>Indiegogo</i> will keep a percentage of the funds raised whether we reach the goal or not, and that is why it is important to aim to surpass the projected goal.</li>
<li>The album will be promoted initially in Ecuador, and for this reason some of the perks are not available in all countries. It is necessary to review all the conditions detailed in each of the perks before purchasing of any of them.</li>
<li>Other perk items can travel around the world so you can receive them at your door, but for that purpose I need to add shipping costs. This cost may vary depending on where you are purchasing it from.</li>
<li>The dates of delivery of the rewards are estimated. I guarantee 100% of the deliveries but it is important to consider that, even working in an efficient and time-measured way, this is a meticulous process, and the album and its perks will take some time before being fully materialized.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</h3>
<p>I am infinitely grateful for all the donations, but if you can't make a financial contribution, you can also help a lot with just a little bit of your time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watching, liking, and sharing the campaign video with as many people as possible. </li>
<li>Spreading the voice about this campaign, and encouraging others to contribute with their grain of sand.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Thank you so much to all the people reading this for your help, your interest, your faith in me, and all of your support. I promise this is just the beginning!</strong></p>
<p>With love,</p>

Estudio de grabación
Honorarios de los músicos
Mezcla y masterización
Arte gráfico (fotografía y diseño de la portada)

Costos de distribución
Costos de promoción

For this reason, it's best aiming to exceed the projected goal (which is allowed and encouraged), and all the ""extra"" money collected will also be destined to the production and post-production of the album, particularly to fuel the promotion strategies and cover its costs.

WHAT YOU GET
What I like most about Indiegogo is that it allows me to give you something in return for your help, and depending on the amount you contribute, you can pick among a variety of perks that I have prepared for all of you with lots of love, such as:

A signed hard copy of the album, and with a personalized note just for you.
Tote-bag kits with the album's design and filled with personalized gifts such as handwritten lyrics, painted by me, and framed.
Singing lessons (face-to-face or via Skype)
Private concerts.
And (my favorite) a song written by me for you, or for someone you love, based on a story, poem, or idea of ​​yours that you would like to turn into music.

Remember that, if you prefer it, you can also contribute with donations without claiming a perk in exchange for them.

RISKS & CHALLENGES
Like any project, carrying out this initiative involves some risks:

As I was saying, Indiegogo will keep a percentage of the funds raised whether we reach the goal or not, and that is why it is important to aim to surpass the projected goal.
The album will be promoted initially in Ecuador, and for this reason some of the perks are not available in all countries. It is necessary to review all the conditions detailed in each of the perks before purchasing of any of them.
Other perk items can travel around the world so you can receive them at your door, but for that purpose I need to add shipping costs. This cost may vary depending on where you are purchasing it from.
The dates of delivery of the rewards are estimated. I guarantee 100% of the deliveries but it is important to consider that, even working in an efficient and time-measured way, this is a meticulous process, and the album and its perks will take some time before being fully materialized.


OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP
I am infinitely grateful for all the donations, but if you can't make a financial contribution, you can also help a lot with just a little bit of your time:

Watching, liking, and sharing the campaign video with as many people as possible. 
Spreading the voice about this campaign, and encouraging others to contribute with their grain of sand.

Thank you so much to all the people reading this for your help, your interest, your faith in me, and all of your support. I promise this is just the beginning!
With love,
Camila.

Music is my biggest passion in life, and playing the oud is one of the things I love doing the most. Whenever I pick up my oud and start playing a few notes it transcends me to another world.</p><p> </p><h3><u>WHY AM I DOING THIS?</u></h3><p>The effects of listening to the oud are immediate and powerful. It is so expressive that if you let it, it can draw you in and put you in a trance. It can calm your mind and soul.</p><p>On this album I am playing an oud that was made for me by Iraqi/Canadian luthier Saad Al Tayyar, a true artist and one of the greatest oud makers of our current times. It's a real honour for me to own it. It gave me a completely new voice through which I am able to express myself. It has brought me so much joy, and now I wish to share this joy with everyone.</p><p>This album represents many important things to me. It is a milestone, a culmination of almost two decades of experience as a professional musician, of many years that I spent practicing, studying, listening, absorbing, performing, collaborating. So far it all led to this album.</p><p> </p><h3><u>THE MUSIC ON THIS ALBUM</u></h3><p>I’ve always believed that one of the best ways to get introduced to any culture is through its music. Music unites people of different backgrounds. Having lived a part of my life in Cairo, and another in Montreal, I have become naturally and equally exposed to both eastern and western cultures. Having also spent years studying jazz as well as classical Arabic music, I seek to find a common ground where both cultures meet and complement one another.</p><p>This common ground between the two gave birth to the idea of this trio (around the end of 2014) as the combination of the oud, upright bass and oriental percussion was already on my mind for a while. Three instruments that cover the three main elements of music: melody, rhythm, and harmony. Accompanying me on this album are two world-class musicians: Mike De Masi, one of the most talented upright bass players from Montreal’s vibrant jazz scene, and Joseph Khoury, one of the top oriental percussionists from Montreal’s diverse oriental/world music scenes.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1538866130/rnuacz6w6n2ef7ssyjog.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The music on this album is a result of almost four years of us playing together, developing our sound as one unit, after many performances around the island of Montreal and its surrounding areas. It is an album of original music as well as arrangements of pieces from the traditional Egyptian repertoire. Oh, and there's also an arrangement of a song by Leonard Cohen!</p><p> </p><h3><u>THE PROJECT</u></h3><p>Being a perfectionist by nature, I seek only the best elements. The recording takes place live at Piccolo Studios, one of the top studios in Montreal, where Celine Dion herself launched her career! Pierre Messier, the recording engineer, helped us capture the live performances beautifully. The editing and mixing are done by Omar Raafat in Cairo, a super-talented sound engineer and a good friend of mine. The mastering is done by Stefano Amerio in Italy, one of the top sound engineers out there with over 400 albums under his belt. Three engineers in three different continents!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539011812/tzmyxiqrsyo4ddhrejzn.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The album cover drawing (shown above in progress) is created by my very own super talented sister, artist Layla Omar El-Farouk, founder of Place Des Arts art center in Cairo. The photography and videography taken during the recording sessions are by Joshua Hansen, one of the most active and talented film makers in Montreal. On second camera is Evan Shay, another very talented photographer/film maker, and an incredible saxophone player. The album design is created by Lucas Zafiris, a super talented graphic designer with a very sensitive artistic touch.</p><p>I am completely managing this whole project solo from A to Z (music arrangements, management, promotion…etc). It’s been downright exhausting, but the results are starting to appear and I am super excited!</p><p> </p><h3><u>THE REWARDS</u></h3><p>Contribute in the making of this amazing project by choosing one of the rewards on the right --&gt;</p><p> It would make a great idea for a gift (birthday, Christmas…etc)!</p><p>Rewards would be delivered after the campaign ends.</p><p> </p><h3><u>THE BUDGET</u></h3><p>Making an album costs money. Making an album with good quality ingredients costs a looooot of money! The entire budget costs more or less 8000 CAD. I am looking to raise 5000 CAD to start with. If I am able to raise more, it will help in the future in funding the editing costs of the songs that were filmed during the recording sessions, using four different cameras!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1538865513/v0kjnsb1ifxndjormkoa.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3><u>CAN'T CONTRIBUTE? NO PROBLEM!</u></h3><p>What you can do instead is spread the word within your network and on your social media campaigns. Word of mouth marketing and third-party endorsements are wonderful things!</p><p>Let this wonderful instrument that is entrenched in so much of mankind’s history be discovered. Help create tolerance and understanding across cultures.</p><p>Peace and love.</p><p><img class=""lazy""

Egyptian/Canadian oud player/guitarist originally from Cairo, now based in Montreal. Music is my biggest passion in life, and playing the oud is one of the things I love doing the most. Whenever I pick up my oud and start playing a few notes it transcends me to another world. WHY AM I DOING THIS?The effects of listening to the oud are immediate and powerful. It is so expressive that if you let it, it can draw you in and put you in a trance. It can calm your mind and soul.On this album I am playing an oud that was made for me by Iraqi/Canadian luthier Saad Al Tayyar, a true artist and one of the greatest oud makers of our current times. It's a real honour for me to own it. It gave me a completely new voice through which I am able to express myself. It has brought me so much joy, and now I wish to share this joy with everyone.This album represents many important things to me. It is a milestone, a culmination of almost two decades of experience as a professional musician, of many years that I spent practicing, studying, listening, absorbing, performing, collaborating. So far it all led to this album. THE MUSIC ON THIS ALBUMI’ve always believed that one of the best ways to get introduced to any culture is through its music. Music unites people of different backgrounds. Having lived a part of my life in Cairo, and another in Montreal, I have become naturally and equally exposed to both eastern and western cultures. Having also spent years studying jazz as well as classical Arabic music, I seek to find a common ground where both cultures meet and complement one another.This common ground between the two gave birth to the idea of this trio (around the end of 2014) as the combination of the oud, upright bass and oriental percussion was already on my mind for a while. Three instruments that cover the three main elements of music: melody, rhythm, and harmony. Accompanying me on this album are two world-class musicians: Mike De Masi, one of the most talented upright bass players from Montreal’s vibrant jazz scene, and Joseph Khoury, one of the top oriental percussionists from Montreal’s diverse oriental/world music scenes.The music on this album is a result of almost four years of us playing together, developing our sound as one unit, after many performances around the island of Montreal and its surrounding areas. It is an album of original music as well as arrangements of pieces from the traditional Egyptian repertoire. Oh, and there's also an arrangement of a song by Leonard Cohen! THE PROJECTBeing a perfectionist by nature, I seek only the best elements. The recording takes place live at Piccolo Studios, one of the top studios in Montreal, where Celine Dion herself launched her career! Pierre Messier, the recording engineer, helped us capture the live performances beautifully. The editing and mixing are done by Omar Raafat in Cairo, a super-talented sound engineer and a good friend of mine. The mastering is done by Stefano Amerio in Italy, one of the top sound engineers out there with over 400 albums under his belt. Three engineers in three different continents!The album cover drawing (shown above in progress) is created by my very own super talented sister, artist Layla Omar El-Farouk, founder of Place Des Arts art center in Cairo. The photography and videography taken during the recording sessions are by Joshua Hansen, one of the most active and talented film makers in Montreal. On second camera is Evan Shay, another very talented photographer/film maker, and an incredible saxophone player. The album design is created by Lucas Zafiris, a super talented graphic designer with a very sensitive artistic touch.I am completely managing this whole project solo from A to Z (music arrangements, management, promotion…etc). It’s been downright exhausting, but the results are starting to appear and I am super excited! THE REWARDSContribute in the making of this amazing project by choosing one of the rewards on the right --> It would make a great idea for a gift (birthday, Christmas…etc)!Rewards would be delivered after the campaign ends. THE BUDGETMaking an album costs money. Making an album with good quality ingredients costs a looooot of money! The entire budget costs more or less 8000 CAD. I am looking to raise 5000 CAD to start with. If I am able to raise more, it will help in the future in funding the editing costs of the songs that were filmed during the recording sessions, using four different cameras! CAN'T CONTRIBUTE? NO PROBLEM!What you can do instead is spread the word within your network and on your social media campaigns. Word of mouth marketing and third-party endorsements are wonderful things!Let this wonderful instrument that is entrenched in so much of mankind’s history be discovered. Help create tolerance and understanding across cultures.Peace and love.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>""Where have you been, Lacey?""</h3>
<p>I know it's been a while since my last CD. And nowadays, most artists are expected to release new music almost every month. But this project might be the most important of my career, and I wanted to be absolutely positive that the songs are as close to perfect as possible, and that they are the best representation of me and my music. And, after three long years, I FINALLY feel confident that these new songs, and my new sound, are ready to share with the world!  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525438044/po3wzgpfxucf9dwirzc3.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>My greatest resource has been my amazing fans. I've played over 100 shows since February of 2016, and the feedback I received from the people who attended those shows has been invaluable! I played to people from around the world and your comments about which songs you love, what keeps you coming back to more shows, what about the show moved you, and so much more, has helped me grow as an artist and songwriter. And I think it shows on this new album.</p>
<p>Your help with this Indiegogo Campaign will help me get these songs recorded by the best possible producer and musicians, and will also provide the means to create more videos, come up with exciting new merchandise, and FINALLY go ON TOUR to all of the places so many fans have asked me to visit! But, I can't do it alone, and here's how you can help, and what you can get in return...</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Here's The Deal</h3>
<p>Releasing a new album takes a lot of people, time, and money. Doing it without a record label is a HUGE undertaking, but more and more artists are doing it by getting their fans involved... fans just like YOU!</p>
<p>In order to make this project a reality, I'm trying to raise <strong>$10,000</strong>. Here is where and how that money will be spent:</p>
<ul>
<li>$7,500: Producer, recording, and musician fees</li>
<li>$1,500: CD Manufacturing/Printing</li>
<li>$1,000: Merch (t-shirts, posters, custom guitar picks, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>And if we raise MORE than the goal, any extra money will be put towards a SUMMER TOUR. Of course, touring takes a lot of funding with fuel expenses, vehicle maintenance, meals &amp; lodging, etc. It takes a minimum of <strong>$250</strong> in expenses for each city we visit, and I am hoping to do a 15 city tour this summer, which would cost about <strong>$3,750</strong>. So, the more we raise over the goal, the better the chances I might be performing in YOUR town!</p>
<p>AND... everyone who contributes gets SOMETHING in return! Rewards include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom guitar picks</li>
<li>Signed exclusive photos or posters</li>
<li>Invitations to a private Facebook Live Show</li>
<li>Signed copies of CD's</li>
<li>T-Shirts</li>
<li>A 30-minute Skype call or lesson</li>
<li>Personalized videos (you choose the cover song)</li>
<li>A 90-minute LIVE performance at your home!!</li>
</ul>
<p>So check out the perks on the right side of this page and select the level that's best for you!</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I am so grateful for anything you can give, and I know that so many people live paycheck to paycheck, so giving ANY money is a very big deal for them. I am SO confident that we can reach the goal of this campaign, and even go WAY above it, but if timing just isn't right and we fall short, my parents have always taught me how to make the most out of what you have, so I know I'll still be able to make GREAT album. </p>
<p>If the goal isn't met, we can explore options like putting fewer songs on the CD, or looking into CD printing packages that don't include artwork, less expensive packaging, etc. So, <i><strong>no matter what</strong></i>, this project is happening... BUT, reaching the goal will mean putting my absolute BEST foot forward, and giving theses new songs the best treatment possible!</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute financially to this campaign, that's absolutely understandable! But, I can still use your help in other ways...</p>
<ul>
<li>Share this Indiegogo page on your social media pages to help get the word out!</li>
<li>Tell your friends, family, or fellow fans who might be able to contribute, or who might be able to get the word out as well!</li>
<li>Tune-in to my Facebook Live or Instagram Live shows during the campaign and share the broadcasts or invite friends to join!</li>
</ul>

AND... everyone who contributes gets SOMETHING in return! Rewards include:

Custom guitar picks
Signed exclusive photos or posters
Invitations to a private Facebook Live Show
Signed copies of CD's
T-Shirts
A 30-minute Skype call or lesson
Personalized videos (you choose the cover song)
A 90-minute LIVE performance at your home!!

So check out the perks on the right side of this page and select the level that's best for you!

 
Risks & Challenges
I am so grateful for anything you can give, and I know that so many people live paycheck to paycheck, so giving ANY money is a very big deal for them. I am SO confident that we can reach the goal of this campaign, and even go WAY above it, but if timing just isn't right and we fall short, my parents have always taught me how to make the most out of what you have, so I know I'll still be able to make GREAT album. 
If the goal isn't met, we can explore options like putting fewer songs on the CD, or looking into CD printing packages that don't include artwork, less expensive packaging, etc. So, no matter what, this project is happening... BUT, reaching the goal will mean putting my absolute BEST foot forward, and giving theses new songs the best treatment possible!

 
Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute financially to this campaign, that's absolutely understandable! But, I can still use your help in other ways...

<p>My name is Andrew Longaker. I'm a jazz musician, surfer and entrepreneur. I grew up in Southern California surfing and skateboarding and began playing in a rock band as a teenager. At 16 I became obsessed with learning to play jazz. At 18 I entered the UCLA Herb Alpert school of music under the direction of jazz legend Kenny Burrell (Burrell played guitar on ""What a Wonderful World"" by Louis Armstrong). At 22 I moved to Chicago to try my hand at the jazz scene. I led various bands under my own name and recorded 5 records (3 of which are available in the Perks section of this project). In 2017 I left Chicago and returned to California to pursue surfing and take on new challenges as an athlete and musician. The surf video ""Invisible Force"" and ""The Bridge"" reflect this exciting transition. </p>
<p>This upcoming album explores new themes and musical landscapes. Lost Realm conveys the vital importance of moving out of one's comfort zone and reaching for excellence in more than one pursuit. Many are the people who perform their job or their craft well but fall short in other areas of life. Few are those who push to move beyond the familiar and into the Lost Realm- the vital stream of knowledge of our past and future.  </p>
<p>I couldn't talk this talk without walking it first. Musically, I've stepped out of this comfort zone and prepared 3 songs which are out of my wheelhouse musically (since 2005 I've recorded purely instrumental jazz music). I sing and rap on these 3 songs, and trade verses with eclectic beat maker Dale Marron. Together, we've fused diverse elements into one sound which will be heard on these 3 songs. The other songs will be solo guitar, followed by a surprise bonus track!</p>
<p>I was inspired to use my voice and delve into another style. After all, Duke Ellington's quote about genres is still true; ""There are only two types of music: good music and the other kind"".</p>
<p>If you are a music listener, I am confident you'll thoroughly enjoy this new record and be able to listen to it again and again. </p>
<p>This campaign is to pay for the production, recording, mixing and mastering, pressing and release of this new CD. As an independent artist, I look to your interest and contributions to help bring this musical work to fruition. Any and all support is much appreciated!</p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of the funds which I am seeking to raise:</p>
<p>Recording: $2,100</p>

<p>Easydisc CD pressing: $500</p>

2.  Online and Hardcopy Duplication:  We want to get this music out to the whole wide world.  By having online and hardcopy distribution MoonCandy will be heard near and far in no time.  
3.  Yoshi's Live Video Production - We need video footage for promotion and to solidify future bookings 4. Hiring a publicist -  Hiring a publicist  will help MoonCandy step up their game and get wider coverage and gig opportunities.   The ImpactMoonCandy has been on the Bay Area music scene since 2010 appearing at many local festivals such as;  Oakland Pride, The Black Eyed Pea Festival, Yerba Buena Garden Festival, Malcolm X Jazz Fest, The Laurel Street Fair, The Oakland Museum and headlining at Oakland's Famed ThePeople Party.  Mooncandy's most reflective work has been as the musical soundtrack for Nicole Klaymoon's Dance Company the ""Embodiment Project"" providing original music documenting the struggle of African-Americans, systemic racism, and sexism in America.  In the spirit of the Black church, Jazz, The Freedom Singers, and Disco sensation Sylvester, MoonCandy creates an environment for survival music to live and thrive through live performance. Using the dance floor as a it's universal synagogue, MoonCandy's inspirational lyrics and transfixing  grooves gives birth to a ""House Church""  where everyone is welcome to dance for love.      Risks & Challenges The thing about recording a live album is,  you never actually know how much money you're going to need... or at least we didn't.  Mooncandy raised enough funds to record all the vocal and instrumental elements of the album by sacrificing monies from our 2015 summer gigs, however, we need your support to complete this process.   MoonCandy is a group of friends who became family through the music.  We all have day jobs, families and ""The Struggle is Real"".  Currently we are in need of investors, PR, Marketing and administrative support.  Our hope is to acquire a manager and team, but we need an album and promotional package to help share our story in a professional way.  Other Ways You Can Help
All donations small and large are appreciated.  If you are not in a position to give financially, please consider reposting our indiegogo page or sharing our Yoshi's event information with your communities.  We are gratful for your support and appreciate that you want to help us along the way.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>About the Project</h3>
<p>Broken Things began recording our as of now nameless seven song 12"" EP in the summer of 2016 with Norval Alleman at <i>NorvalSound Recording Studio</i>, in St. Petersburg, FL. We are currently (approximately) 90% done with the recording portion of our self-funded project. </p>
<p>The four of us — Anthony, Stewart, Colin and Mike — are vinyl aficionados, and one thing became abundantly clear about halfway through the recording process: after releasing two EP's via CD and digital download, we would LOVE to commit something to vinyl!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Unfortunately without the support of a label, paired with the inability to tour full-time — as well as the additional exorbitant costs associated with the mastering and pressing of an LP — we are short the funds needed to see the totality of our vision come to fruition. That's where you come in.</p>
<p>We have set up a four tiered reward system, should you choose to help us reach our goal of pressing 250 12"" EP's. You can read about those rewards under the ""Support This Project"" tab.</p>
<p>With this project, we will have 45-days to raise the remaining $1,700 needed to pay for the recording and mastering of the album, as well as send you any of the tangible rewards if/when we meet our goal. Check back often for any updates (video or otherwise) on the project. </p>
<p>Any leftover funds will be used to recoup any extraneous recording expenses, as well as the creation of our own boutique vinyl only label, Dead Sound Recordings.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution, while not saving the world by any stretch of the imagination, will go a long well in helping four budding musicians finally realize their dream of recording, and self-releasing, what we think is a quality project. And while we may no longer sound exactly as we had two years ago — What can I say? Band evolution can be a very good thing! — your contribution will help us create a caché as it were ... an indelible reminder of a time and a place.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have isolated two risks or challenges for you — our potential benefactor — as well as us:</p>
<p>1. Turn around time for the vinyl release. Because of the recent ""vinyl boom,"" there may be a delay in the time associated with the pressing of a record — <a href=""http://5chicago.com/features/2015-record-pressing-delays/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">something that has been well documented</a>. </p>
<p>In kind, we will be upfront and honest, and maintain communication with you all along the way.</p>
<p>2. If we do not meet our goal, we will find another way to master and put our pending release.</p>

<h3>We are inviting you to support the new direction of our work.  Sound Light ceremonies through the gift of song.</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551387651/zvs0lgf3jylcxzdyc0xn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>This campaign (and your support) is something that ripples well beyond the mere physical and monetary support to us as a group.  It is support that extends to the shamanic healing of lands, people, creatures and environments - as we take these songs and share them internationally, and give them to you to use in the same way as the great planetary healing expands.  It is an album at service to All of Creation, for All of Creation, with All of Creation.  And with your support YOU will be the first to receive these songs and have privilege to use them!</p>
<p>Our trio is composed of musicians <a href=""http://www.bhakticonnection.ca/biography/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Joe Ronco </a>(guitar, vocals and musical construction virtuoso), <a href=""http://www.bhakticonnection.ca/biography/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Reaz Bacchus</a>  (tabla drums, vocals and rhythm-blaster extraordinaire) and <a href=""http://santainaii.com/santainaii/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bermalva Porter </a>(vocals, percussion and Earthen en-chant-tress).  Together these forces of nature create The Bhakti Connection, converging since 2007.</p>
<p>This is the core reason for the existence of the group - to offer a refuge and place of healing, peace and spiritual evolution through music. For the first time in the history of The Bhakti Connection, this album expresses the very unique essence of Sound Light, as heard and recorded by the group.  There is an accompanying book called ""Priestess of Light Ceremonies"" written by Bermalva that teaches the practical use of these songs  (be sure to choose the ""Book &amp; CD"" perk option if interested!)</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>What is the Music?</h3>
<p>Sound Light is the original form of music on Earth.  To compare the type of music on this album to what you might know, we can say it carries a multi-cultural vibe, with hints of tribal cultures, traditional native shamanistic drum beats,  trance-like repetitive chant, and soothing nature inspired melodies.  You will hear bird calls, throat singing, high soprano and low Tibetan singing tones.  It's an album that can be used in a yoga class, for relaxation, and with some songs for dancing! All songs are original and authentic, the way Sound Light usually comes!</p>
<p>Examples of song titles, to give you a sneak peak are; ""Lila song"", ""Sovereignty Song"", ""Yahweah"", ""Goddess Anthem"", ""Meant to Be"" and more!</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Sacred Exchange</h3>
<p>By supporting this campaign by ""pre-sale"" and other fun perks, it guarantees YOU get the very first copies of the album, hot off the press!</p>
<p>Making an album is expensive! We have sound engineering costs ($35/hour), graphic design, sound mastering (specific technical sound engineering), CD covers and copying onto disc, paid advertising, and a music video recording cost (single release ""Yahweah"" video).</p>
<p>Here are our estimates for costs for this album:</p>
<ul>
<li>In studio recording <strong>$3000</strong>
</li>
<li>Mastering <strong>$500+</strong>
</li>
<li>Graphic Design <strong>$200+</strong>

<li>CD cover and copying printing <strong>$1000+</strong>
</li>
<li>Music videographer <strong>$500</strong>
</li>
<li>Advertising <strong>$300</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>IF we reach our modest goal (and hopefully surpass it!) and you become one of the firsts to receive the album, it will be a most joyful relationship exchange!  Our sacred supporters!  Our greater costs will be covered, and we will have avoided going into personal dept.  You will have a new album as a soundscape for your everyday life, ceremonies and healings. </p>

<p>Most people know me for my words. As a journalist, I’ve covered elections in multiple countries, interviewed White House officials, combated Nazis online, profiled unusual Jews in baseball, and even chronicled the translation of Harry Potter into Yiddish. But for the last 5 years, I’ve been quietly working on something very different: an original album of Jewish music.</p>
<p>Today, I'm ready to share it with the rest of you—and with your help, many people beyond.</p>
<p>(A quick note: To see what's included in any perk on the right, just click it.)</p>
<p><strong>THE PROJECT</strong></p>
<p>Music has long been a universal language among Jews, transcending time periods, ideologies, and denominations. Jewish communities that would never speak to each other somehow sing to each other, sharing the same tunes even when they seem to share little else. In an increasingly fractious time, these melodies serve as a rare unifying force. The beauty of music is that it transcends localities and languages. The beauty of Jewish music is that it also transcends our communal and ideological divides.</p>
<p>This is particularly true of the songs we sing on Shabbat, the Jewish day of rest. To that end, for many years, I've been working on a new collection of modern melodies for traditional Jewish Shabbat songs, from <i>Shalom Aleichem</i> to <i>Lecha Dodi</i>. Together with a fantastic team of musicians and vocalists, I've produced two of the tracks—one which you can hear above, and another which will be released during this campaign—and created demos for the rest.</p>
<p>How do those demos become full-fledged productions? That's where you come in.</p>
<p><strong>MAKING THE MUSIC HAPPEN</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>My definition of success is a simple one: to give people new melodies to enrich their Jewish lives, however they define them. It’s to walk into a Jewish gathering somewhere in the world and hear that they are singing one of my songs and have no idea who I am, because the melody has taken on a meaning beyond its composer.</p>
<p>Together, we can make that a reality. To this point, I've been self-funding this project out of my own pocket. That's sustainable for a couple songs, but not for an entire album, especially if the goal is not simply to produce the music, but to share it widely and enable as many people as possible to learn and enjoy it.</p>
<p>Here's what your contribution will support:</p>
<ul>
<li>Production of the <strong>entire album</strong>, including studio, musicians, mixing, mastering, and distribution</li>
<li>Making available <strong>free sheet music </strong>for each track for those who wish to learn and teach the songs</li>
<li>Creating <strong>animated lyrics clips </strong>to enable the songs to be shared and learned online<br/> </li>
</ul>
<div>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/fhGs2N5XNOg?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p><br/><strong>REWARDS</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Depending on the level of your contribution, here's what you'll get:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>digital download </strong>of the entire album, plus <strong>immediate MP3s </strong>of each single off the album as they are released (as an online-only project, you'll get your music instantly)</li>
<li>Additional <strong>bonus tracks</strong>, from beautiful instrumental variations to entirely alternate versions</li>
</ul>
<p>There's more: Want to learn how to lead a prayer service, and even get some coaching for that from me? Get a personal thank you on Twitter? An advance copy of the album? Those are just some of the other perks available. Click any perk on the left to expand it and see its details! You can also contribute at any perk level whether or not you want the particular perk. Every contribution is greatly appreciated. You can even click ""Back It"" at the top of this page and give a custom amount of your choosing.</p>

<p>I've found that the secret to doing something well in life is to surround yourself with people who are better at it than you and have even stranger names. (That last one may be specific to me.) I've been extremely lucky to collaborate on all the harmonies and backing vocals for this project with two immensely talented performers who fit this description:</p>
<p><i>Abbaleh Savitt </i>is the former musical director of New York University's Jewish a cappella group <i>Ani V'Ata</i>, an attorney, and sometimes high holiday <i>chazan</i>.</p>
<p><i>Arun Viswanath </i>is the former musical director of Harvard University's Jewish a cappella group, <i>Shani</i>, a tech start-up employee by day, and the official Yiddish translator of <i>Harry Potter</i> by night.</p>
<p><i>Yair Rosenberg </i>(that's me!)<i> </i>is a senior writer at <i>Tablet Magazine</i>, where he covers politics, culture, and religion. His work has also appeared in the <i>New York Times</i>,<i> Washington Post</i>, <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, and <i>The Atlantic</i>, and has received awards from the Religion Newswriters Association and the Harvard Center for Jewish studies.

</div></div>","Most people know me for my words. As a journalist, I’ve covered elections in multiple countries, interviewed White House officials, combated Nazis online, profiled unusual Jews in baseball, and even chronicled the translation of Harry Potter into Yiddish. But for the last 5 years, I’ve been quietly working on something very different: an original album of Jewish music.
Today, I'm ready to share it with the rest of you—and with your help, many people beyond.
(A quick note: To see what's included in any perk on the right, just click it.)
THE PROJECT
Music has long been a universal language among Jews, transcending time periods, ideologies, and denominations. Jewish communities that would never speak to each other somehow sing to each other, sharing the same tunes even when they seem to share little else. In an increasingly fractious time, these melodies serve as a rare unifying force. The beauty of music is that it transcends localities and languages. The beauty of Jewish music is that it also transcends our communal and ideological divides.
This is particularly true of the songs we sing on Shabbat, the Jewish day of rest. To that end, for many years, I've been working on a new collection of modern melodies for traditional Jewish Shabbat songs, from Shalom Aleichem to Lecha Dodi. Together with a fantastic team of musicians and vocalists, I've produced two of the tracks—one which you can hear above, and another which will be released during this campaign—and created demos for the rest.
How do those demos become full-fledged productions? That's where you come in.
MAKING THE MUSIC HAPPEN

My definition of success is a simple one: to give people new melodies to enrich their Jewish lives, however they define them. It’s to walk into a Jewish gathering somewhere in the world and hear that they are singing one of my songs and have no idea who I am, because the melody has taken on a meaning beyond its composer.
Together, we can make that a reality. To this point, I've been self-funding this project out of my own pocket. That's sustainable for a couple songs, but not for an entire album, especially if the goal is not simply to produce the music, but to share it widely and enable as many people as possible to learn and enjoy it.
Here's what your contribution will support:

Production of the entire album, including studio, musicians, mixing, mastering, and distribution
Making available free sheet music for each track for those who wish to learn and teach the songs
Creating animated lyrics clips to enable the songs to be shared and learned online 



REWARDS

Depending on the level of your contribution, here's what you'll get:

A digital download of the entire album, plus immediate MP3s of each single off the album as they are released (as an online-only project, you'll get your music instantly)
Additional bonus tracks, from beautiful instrumental variations to entirely alternate versions

There's more: Want to learn how to lead a prayer service, and even get some coaching for that from me? Get a personal thank you on Twitter? An advance copy of the album? Those are just some of the other perks available. Click any perk on the left to expand it and see its details! You can also contribute at any perk level whether or not you want the particular perk. Every contribution is greatly appreciated. You can even click ""Back It"" at the top of this page and give a custom amount of your choosing.
THE TEAM

I've found that the secret to doing something well in life is to surround yourself with people who are better at it than you and have even stranger names. (That last one may be specific to me.) I've been extremely lucky to collaborate on all the harmonies and backing vocals for this project with two immensely talented performers who fit this description:
Abbaleh Savitt is the former musical director of New York University's Jewish a cappella group Ani V'Ata, an attorney, and sometimes high holiday chazan.
Arun Viswanath is the former musical director of Harvard University's Jewish a cappella group, Shani, a tech start-up employee by day, and the official Yiddish translator of Harry Potter by night.
Yair Rosenberg (that's me!) is a senior writer at Tablet Magazine, where he covers politics, culture, and religion. His work has also appeared in the New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, and The Atlantic, and has received awards from the Religion Newswriters Association and the Harvard Center for Jewish studies. He promises to stop writing in the third-person now.
Finally, there's our valiant maestro, Charles Newman of Cottage Sounds in Brooklyn, New York. He's a music producer, recording engineer, composer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, talent manager​ and music publisher​, and the co-founder of New York City's Mother West Records and Studios​, The Deli Magazine​, and the band PLEASE​.
Throughout the project, we'll update you with behind-the-scenes looks at how the music gets created—the sort of thing that's really fun but rarely seen. For example, here's the exact moment that the opening harmony for the Shalom Aleichem above came together:

<br/>
The album will have 10 songs and will be organised as a mixtape; all the songs
will have a altro, an autonomous end that complements and makes connection to
the next song. The rhythm has become the key in the composition and is
notorious the greater definition and complexity of beats, expanded by the
introduction of machines like the Yamaha DD 10 and MFB Tanzbär. There is now a
greater maturity in the harmonic choices, from poetry rap, the strength of
metal-rock, the techno hypnosis, to the simplicity of Pop and the glow of the
dance floor. In the harmonies the new album also demonstrates a new stage in
the writing process, with greater language and structural complexity which
makes a contrast with the use of simple and direct melodies in the choruses.
This mixture of universes, between major and minor chords, carries the melodies
to a limbo between melancholy and euphoria, in a so Portuguese way of feeling.<br/>
<br/>
<b>WHY WE MOVE TO CROWDFUNDING.</b><br/>
<br/>
With the first album, Modern Music (Ed.Autor / Compact 2014), we gathered our
best songbook from the last six years, a sort of compendium of songs that
resulted best in our parties. We fought long not to edit, if we weren't ready
for it. We are in no hurry, TOCHAPESTANA is not a 100 meters race, is a fiery
marathon! We did ""Musica Moderna"" (A.K.A. Modern Music) when we
could, a statement from the beginning of our life. From here on we are ready
for everything. And so less than a year later, still turning the Musica Moderna
show, we entered the studio for a new album, on our own, obeying our instinct.
And now is this new record that will create a new show, a show that you can see
happening.<br/>
<br/>
<b>THE RACE IN REAL LIFE</b><br/>
<br/>
In every concert we did this last year, in all the towns and villages we went
through, we felt a flash: after all we have public, after all we have people
who live the show, and that want to hear, whether they are teens that expect us
at the end of a concert, or seniors who buy our CD in the middle of a summer
concert or hipsters in a nightclub of the capital. There is nothing that will
make us stop until we feel that there is someone that awaits us. As one of the
new songs from the upcoming album says, ""one fan is enough for it to be
true / one fan is enough to have a crew"" And this is all it matters.<br/>
<br/>
<b>YOU DO TAKE PART</b><br/>
<br/>
We then asked for a simple thing: the best way to see the birth of this record
is to buy it in advance. So that you will be part of the process, a special
bond between us. That's what we ask. It's little, but we will do a lot with
little. And we will send each album for you completely customised, with the

Randy Lindsay did and the result of those musings was the concept for the play, Nine Months With Angels. Randy pictured angels keeping the unborn Alicia company until her time arrived to be born on Earth. The soundtrack will be available separate from the play and contains songs that vary from hand-clapping happy to spiritually profound. 
Celine Durney has composed the music for the soundtrack. As you can see from the clip we have provided, she is a talented young woman able to weave together catchy melodies. 
Together Randy and Celine have created 15 songs they believe will touch the hearts of listeners. These are songs which look at birth and life in an inventive and heart-warming manner. 
We invite you to be part of a project to bring a little more light into the world. 

What We Need & What You Get

 We need to raise $3,500 to realize the dream that is Nine Months With Angels.

</p><p><b>PARTY WITH A PURPOSE</b></p><p>On September 19, 2015 at 8pm at the Masonic Temple, 317 Clermont Ave. #4, Brooklyn NY 11205, the
ground-breaking Experiential Orchestra is partnering with Groupmuse to present
a Rite of Spring Dance Party, with all proceeds going to benefit Musicambia, a
program that brings conservatory-style musical training to prisons and jails in the United States. </p>
<p>That’s right-we are inviting the
AUDIENCE (you) to DANCE to the Rite of Spring. You know, the most famously
revolutionary piece of music in history, the piece that caused a riot at its
premiere. A piece so full of rhythm and primal energy that you can’t sit still.
And now you don’t have to. Shake it to the Glorification of the Chosen One, get down to the Dance of the Earth, be evocative in the Evocation of the Ancestors, and grind to the Danse Sacrale.</p>
<p>But it gets better, because in
supporting this Indiegogo, you are also helping a truly important cause:
Musicambia's 2015-16 season. 
Starting in September, selected inmates housed
at correctional facilities in South Carolina and New York will receive
conservatory style training in music theory, performance, and most importantly,
collaborative ensemble work.  In a world
where everyone is forced to stand alone, Musicambia creates a positive
environment for students by using collaborative musical activities to promote
individual growth.  Participants use the
experience to redefine themselves by their potential rather than their past,
creating dedicated and passionate human beings with the confidence and work
ethic required for successful reentry into society.  </p><p>It's changing a lot of lives and giving hope to families while raising awareness about prisons in the United States. Your donations-and the ticket revenue-will go to support this great cause. </p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Come and make history by getting
sweaty to the most bad-ass piece of music ever written, and help a worthwhile
cause in the process.</span></p><p><b>JOIN THE MOVEMENT</b></p>
<p>The orchestra is assembled from the
very top free-lancers in NYC. They are playing at a highly reduced rate as a way of
supporting this cause, but we need to pay them, and that’s where you come in. Contribute as much as you can, and the full value of what you give is tax-deductible to the fullest extent of the law. Any contribution of over $50 receives admission to the event, and larger donations include perks like drinks with the conductor and your own private house concert with a select group of these superb musicians. </p>

<p><b>THE STORY</b></p>
<p><b>FOLLOW</b> handles pressing and
sensitive issues about race, religion, family, and equality. It delivers with
honesty and truth. <b>FOLLOW</b> personalizes the issues and brings it all home. Home,
where we all want to feel safe and welcome.</p>
<p>Marcus
and Daniel are getting married.<br/>
<br/>
Their foster son Noah calls them ""Dad &amp; Pops"". They're a
""typical"" American family, juggling wedding and adoption plans...
until suddenly their world is turned upside down.<br/>
<br/>
Marcus' estranged religious father returns to take over the family business,
setting events in motion that threaten to tear the family apart. After years of
distance and denial, Marcus has one more chance to reconcile with his father
and face the painful memories of his past, before he can raise a family of his
own.</p>
<p><b>THE MUSIC</b></p>
<p>Music is  like another character in this film.  There is a juke box in the cafe that holds old and new tunes.  There will be a church choir.  We have the good fortune to have the multi talented<b> Frenchie Davis</b> on board to play JADE!</p>
<p>We also have the two-time Academy, Golden Globe and Grammy nominated song writer <b>Allan Rich, </b> “Run to You” from the movie BODYGUARD,  on board to write the music.<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Allan is well known for his Grammy  and
Oscar-nominated song ""Run to You"" (co-written with Jud Friedman),
sung by Whitney Houston in “The Bodyguard.” His song ""For the First
Time"" (co-written with Jud Friedman &amp; James Newton Howard) from “One
Fine Day” starring Michelle Pfeiffer and George Clooney was also nominated for
an Academy Award as well as Golden Globe and Grammy Awards – it was also a #1
adult contemporary song for Kenny Loggins. Allan’s song ""I Drive Myself
Crazy"" (co-written with Ellen Shipley &amp; Rick Nowels) was on NSync’s
debut album, which sold 10 million units and was certified “Diamond” by the
RIAA. </p>
<p>We are raising money to develop the MUSIC to this film.  Allan will be writing songs for Frenchie to sing.</p>
<p><b>THE TEAM</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Based on his stage play, <b>Michael Patrick
Spillers</b> has written this ensemble character screenplay that blends the
right mix of comedy and drama to tell the story.  </p>
<p>Emmy-winning actor/director <b>Melanie Mayron </b>(“Thirtysomething”,
“Slap Her She’s French”, “The Baby-Sitters Club,” “Jane the Virgin,” “Switched
at Birth”) will utilize her depth of knowledge and her incredibly honed vision
as a director to tell our story.</p>
<p>Producers are<b> LeeAnne Matusek</b>, who after
seeing the stage play, knew that this film adaptation would be her passion
project, and <b>Todd Shotz</b> (Human Rights Campaign Award winner, former
development executive on films such as “Live Free or Die Hard,” “Sixteen Blocks,”
“Timber Falls” and exec. producer of Paramount’s “Ghost Team One”), who has yearned to work on a project like FOLLOW.</p>
<p>Executive Producers include the legendary film and
television producer <b>Howard Rosenman </b>(“Father of the Bride,” “Buffy the
Vampire Slayer,” Oscar-winning doc “Common Threads,” “Celluloid Closet,”
founder of Project Angel Food), whose background as a gay rights activist is
already having a crucial impact on the production.</p>
Also on the team is
<b>Jan Miller Corran</b>, Executive Producer, who has produced award-winning
documentaries and most recently the feature film “See You In My Dreams”
starring Blythe Danner &amp; Sam Elliott, which premiered at the 2015 Sundance
Film Festival and went on to a successful theatrical release this past spring. </div><div>

</div></div>","THE STORY
FOLLOW handles pressing and
sensitive issues about race, religion, family, and equality. It delivers with
honesty and truth. FOLLOW personalizes the issues and brings it all home. Home,
where we all want to feel safe and welcome.
Marcus
and Daniel are getting married.

Their foster son Noah calls them ""Dad & Pops"". They're a
""typical"" American family, juggling wedding and adoption plans...
until suddenly their world is turned upside down.

Marcus' estranged religious father returns to take over the family business,
setting events in motion that threaten to tear the family apart. After years of
distance and denial, Marcus has one more chance to reconcile with his father
and face the painful memories of his past, before he can raise a family of his
own.
THE MUSIC
Music is  like another character in this film.  There is a juke box in the cafe that holds old and new tunes.  There will be a church choir.  We have the good fortune to have the multi talented Frenchie Davis on board to play JADE!
We also have the two-time Academy, Golden Globe and Grammy nominated song writer Allan Rich,  “Run to You” from the movie BODYGUARD,  on board to write the music.


Allan is well known for his Grammy  and
Oscar-nominated song ""Run to You"" (co-written with Jud Friedman),
sung by Whitney Houston in “The Bodyguard.” His song ""For the First
Time"" (co-written with Jud Friedman & James Newton Howard) from “One
Fine Day” starring Michelle Pfeiffer and George Clooney was also nominated for
an Academy Award as well as Golden Globe and Grammy Awards – it was also a #1
adult contemporary song for Kenny Loggins. Allan’s song ""I Drive Myself
Crazy"" (co-written with Ellen Shipley & Rick Nowels) was on NSync’s
debut album, which sold 10 million units and was certified “Diamond” by the
RIAA. 
We are raising money to develop the MUSIC to this film.  Allan will be writing songs for Frenchie to sing.
THE TEAM


Based on his stage play, Michael Patrick
Spillers has written this ensemble character screenplay that blends the
right mix of comedy and drama to tell the story.  
Emmy-winning actor/director Melanie Mayron (“Thirtysomething”,
“Slap Her She’s French”, “The Baby-Sitters Club,” “Jane the Virgin,” “Switched
at Birth”) will utilize her depth of knowledge and her incredibly honed vision
as a director to tell our story.
Producers are LeeAnne Matusek, who after
seeing the stage play, knew that this film adaptation would be her passion
project, and Todd Shotz (Human Rights Campaign Award winner, former
development executive on films such as “Live Free or Die Hard,” “Sixteen Blocks,”
“Timber Falls” and exec. producer of Paramount’s “Ghost Team One”), who has yearned to work on a project like FOLLOW.
Executive Producers include the legendary film and
television producer Howard Rosenman (“Father of the Bride,” “Buffy the
Vampire Slayer,” Oscar-winning doc “Common Threads,” “Celluloid Closet,”
founder of Project Angel Food), whose background as a gay rights activist is
already having a crucial impact on the production.
Also on the team is
Jan Miller Corran, Executive Producer, who has produced award-winning
documentaries and most recently the feature film “See You In My Dreams”
starring Blythe Danner & Sam Elliott, which premiered at the 2015 Sundance
Film Festival and went on to a successful theatrical release this past spring. 


WHAT WE NEED  
This campaign will cover the cost of recording original songs and securing the copyrights for already recorded songs.  
If you know movie soundtracks, and I think you do if you're looking at our campaign, you KNOW it costs a lot to create those songs or secure previously recorded songs. 
Some of the costs will be studio rental, payment for musicians and vocalists.
Indie filmmakers usually don't plan for the musical part of their budget for the movie they are making and it can make or break the quality of a film.  
We are also currently raising money to film FOLLOW in Spring 2016.
WHAT YOU GET
We have some GREAT perks that we hope you like and will encourage you to support our quest to get it right!  We want to make sure this beautiful story about love and family has a wonderful soundtrack.

<p>It has been written that Rene Bailey is “an unknown national treasure"" and that “it seems like a fluke that the name Rene Bailey is not uttered in the same breath as Aretha Franklin, Mavis Staples, Etta James, etc...”</p>
<p>Those who do know revere her highly, for the soul-power of her voice, over-the-top inspirational performances, and her gracious presence as a human being.</p>
<p>Rene Bailey grew up in southern Georgia. Raised in a family of singers, Rene has been singing professionally since she was a young girl, when she toured the gospel circuit during summer break from school.</p>
<p>She's performed with Louis Armstrong, B.B. King, Aretha Franklin, Sam Cooke, Dave Brubeck, Ruth Brown, Paul Anka, and many more...</p>
<p>Rene has been a local legend in the Hudson Valley since 1973, when she came to take a job as the featured vocalist at the Peg Leg Bates Country Club in Kerhonkson, New York. She still resides in Kerhonkson, where she is the choral director at the Samsonville Methodist Church.</p>
<p>Live audiences are consistently blown away by what Rene does with her singing. Despite a dedicated local following and continuously active career, there has never been a Rene Bailey album. Until now.</p>
<p>Production is being overseen at Lone Pine Road Studio in Kingston, NY, by producer/engineer Eli Winograd, a big fan, whose father has been playing gigs with Rene since the 1980's.</p>
<p>Initial recording sessions took place in November 2016. At this point, the project is at a stand-still until money can be raised to finish the album.</p>
<p>We're raising money to fund the following aspects of the project:</p>
<p>1. Repay a loan that covered session musicians, arranger's fee, and piano tuning for the 3 basic tracking sessions.</p>
<p>2. Promotional video production</p>
<p>3. Arranger's fee for horn and string overdub arrangements</p>
<p>4. Horn and string overdub session musicians</p>
<p>5. Backup vocal overdub session </p>
<p>6. Percussion overdub sessions</p>
<p>7. Rene's fee</p>
<p>8. Studio fees for tracking</p>
<p>9. Mixing</p>
<p>10. Mastering</p>
<p>11. CD manufacture (1000 cds)</p>
<p>Any of the 1000 CD's that are not pre-ordered during the fundraiser or sent out for press review will belong to Rene to sell at gigs.</p>
<p>Any money raised beyond this budget will be applied directly to recording a follow-up Rene Bailey album!!!</p>
<p>In addition, we will do our best to network and promote this album into the music industry in pursuit of new professional opportunities for Rene.</p>
<p>In the event that the entire budget isn't raised, the studio fees, mixing, and mastering costs will be absorbed by labor of love.</p>
<p>This project will be taken to completion no matter what happens in the fundraiser. However, it is most desirable that all of the outstanding hard work be compensated fairly.</p>
<p>Please help by pre-ordering a copy of the album, or several copies to give as gifts to music-loving friends. We're offering discounted prices for multiple copies.</p>
<p>In addition, we're offering some interesting perks, check 'em out!</p>
<p>Please share this fundraiser far and wide with anyone you think might be interested in ordering a copy of an incredible gospel album and supporting Rene Bailey,</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h3>THE PROJECT</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Jo-Ann Richards Goffe and I'm a cultural advocate and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnodoxology"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ethnodoxologist</a>. I am passionate about seeing people from all over the world worship our Creator in their own language and their own music forms. </p>
<p>As a Jamaican who has traveled to over 30 countries, I have never failed to be amazed at how Reggae ambassador Bob Marley has put our little country on the map. If we are known for nothing else, it is for reggae music. Unfortunately, our rich musical heritage is still on the fringes of many of our churches at best, and there is a very small collection of songs in our repertoire that use our language and music.</p>
<p>Kom Mek Wi Worship, my first album in what is now becoming a series, was released in 2012. It is a collection of 12 songs in the Jamaican language and music genres. The project was born out of a vision to see Jamaicans worshipping as Jamaicans, using their own language and their own music genres.</p>
<p>Some churches have been using the songs in their corporate worship, and many from all walks of life, age groups and even non-Jamaicans have been responding positively to it. In the words of one woman who is from an inner city community in Kingston: ""It connects! And it connects me with God!"" (Of course she said this in Jamaican/Patwa!)</p>
<p>'Kom Mek Wi Worship 2: Di Revilieshan' will be another such collection as we continue to promote love and unity in Christ through culturally relevant expressions of worship. This next collection focuses on the book of Revelation which is chock full of amazing worship experiences. </p>
<p>In a nutshell, your support of this project will help Jamaicans everywhere to connect with their true selves, and to connect their true selves to God. It is my firm belief that among other positive outcomes, this will contribute greatly to the reduction of crime and violence in our beautiful island.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>US$12,000.00 is our goal for this project. This will cover musicians and producers' fees, studio fees, mixing and mastering, artwork, CD printing, Indiegogo fees and perk fulfillments. </p>
<p>Here's exactly how we'll use the funds we raise to make this dream a reality:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489796566/vhlcc8j8kxtgrwunx9kr.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>PERKS!</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the usual perks - digital downloads and signed copies of the CDs - we have other exciting ones such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lessons in how to read Jamaican</li>
<li>Mission &amp; Arts Skype Presentations by yours truly Jo-Ann Richards</li>
<li>Live Jamaican Worship Session Online with the CREW 40:4 performing arts team</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What if we far overshoot our goal in this campaign?</strong> Our vision is actually much larger than this one album, and so the more you support this campaign, the more we'll be able to work on the other projects lined up after this one. Our intention is to also start a series for children. Currently there is no collection of Jamaican Children's worship music that uses the language and music of the Jamaican children. We hope to fix that!</p>
<p><strong>What if we don't hit our target? </strong>Well, by any means necessary (legal, of course - borrowing, selling stuff, etc.), we WILL get the album done. This is our commitment! </p>
<p><strong>A LITTLE HISTORY ...</strong></p>
<p>I should let you know that this is actually my third album project. The first one - <strong>Jo-Ann and Friends: The World is Waiting</strong> - was intended to have been just a small in-house project. However, it became much more than that, involving many other persons and groups. It was completed in exactly two months from conception to final product.</p>
<p>The second album - <strong>Kom Mek Wi Worship</strong> - was again intended to have been a small demo album. I was delivering seminars about congregational music and cultural identity, and was using some of my songs as samples of what I thought could be used in worship - the language and music of the people. People kept asking if the songs were not recorded. Again, from start to finish, the album took exactly two months.</p>
<p>This album may take us a little longer than two months, but not much more. One song is already completed, and we have already started on the others. Collaboration is the name of the game here. From old style roots reggae artiste K Vibes to opera singer Ana Strachan to dynamic reggae gospel artiste Rondell Positive, I will be blending my voice with them all for another real Jamaican worship experience.</p>

<p>Another significant feature of this album will be the expression of the global call to worship, including sounds from other cultures. This helps to reflect the national motto of Jamaica: Out of Many, One People. It also on an even grander scale reflects the worship that is reported in the book of Revelation from every tribe, and country and people and language. So far we have connected with a sitar player from India and a balafonist from Burkina Faso!</p>

</div><div><p> </p></div></div>","Colosseum.TV is the urban movement to Showcase & Discover Raw MC Talent through our iOS app, website and Record Label. We support upcoming grime artists. The best moments in grime don’t usually come from pre-recorded vocals or music videos, they happen live in cyphers when MCs get shelly and thrive off each other’s energy. In grime, the term ""shelly"" is used as a sign of appreciation for MCs with hard-hitting, never-ending lyrics and riddims. Our UK Grime Competition captures the immersive experience by filming each cypher live in 360º using cutting edge 4k cameras, so you can watch the madness, feel the energy and appreciate the shells and as if standing at the very the center of the cypher, in 360º VR!
MAD!
Up to 240 artists will feature in 24+ cyphers, at 8 city locations with ALL videos published to Facebook and YouTube every Friday between April and September 2017.

The Prize for 15 Winners
A place on the London Eye super-cypher as well as a record deal for a feature-track on the album Grime 360º.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Project</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""There was a boy A very strange enchanted boy They say he wandered very far, very far Over land and sea A little shy and sad of eye But very wise was he""</i></p>
<p>Beyond the songs, Nat King Cole’s success in the face of many adversities exemplifies the triumph of talent over ignorance and prejudice. Indeed, the impact of this legendary and pioneering artist continues to cut across the world’s cultural and political boundaries. It is not surprising, therefore, that in the five decades since Nat King Cole’s death, his music continues to have a strong and dedicated following. Can anyone really say that they haven’t been moved by songs like (I Love You For), Sentimental Reasons (No.1 for six weeks), or Nature Boy (No.1 for eight weeks)? Nature Boy – The Music Of Nat King Cole is being arranged and produced by Phillip Victor Bova of Bova Sound with the aim of reintroducing these songs to the contemporary jazz scene. While most of the project’s songs have been given new arrangements, my team’s incredible creativity and emotional capacity ensure that the project remains respectful while radiating a fresh new feel. I am convinced that the solid creative and business teams I have assembled will ensure that the music of Nature Boy will again reverberate across boundaries, appealing not only to Nat’s solid fan base but also drawing in a whole new audience!</p>
<p>The songs chosen for this record address universal, as well as deeply personal, struggles, hopes, loves, regrets and fears. Several of Nat King Cole’s 21 top-ten hits are featured in this project, but each song we’ve selected holds a special place in my heart and inspires me to convey the sentiment, warmth, and sophistication behind every lyric. Together, my very talented group of Canadian musicians and I aspire to reinterpret 11 of Nat King Cole’s outstanding jazz standards.</p>
<p><strong>My musical collaborators include:</strong></p>
<p>• John Fraser Findlay - Juno nominated multi‑instrumentalist;</p>
<p>• Jeff Bova - Grammy award winner keyboardist;</p>
<p>• Kevin Breit - Guitar and Mandolin virtuoso and Juno award winner;</p>
<p>• Jennifer Swartz - Montreal Symphony Orchestra Principal Harpist;</p>
<p>• Petr Cancura (Programming Manager of the Ottawa Jazz Festival) Sax and clarinet;</p>
<p>• Socalled - Rapper</p>
<p>• Rebecca Noelle - Vocalist/Peptides</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Artist</h3>
<p>As a black male growing up in the foster care system, music played a major role in my upbringing, it was my retreat. For me, Jazz is more than just a musical genre. It provides an intimate and articulate way of telling stories — stories of love, loss, hope and life. I am very passionate about this project because Nat King Cole’s songs take the listener on a journey through life that everyone can relate to, black or white, young or mature, gay or straight, male or female.</p>
<p>I recorded my first jazz vocal album <i>Somewhere Along The Way </i>while living in Tel Aviv, Israel. Taking this project from inception to completion in a foreign country, hiring and managing arrangers, musicians, producers, arranging for record distribution, video production and promotion, demonstrates my considerable skill at undertaking and completing complex projects. Overall, it was a great experience. My most important take-away was that the experience of building one’s own career in the music business is one of the most rewarding aspects of being a recording artist. With experience, I now recognize that in building one’s own career, it is also important to know when to seek help and guidance that can assist me in achieving my goals. For example, for this project I am working with a manager, professional marketing firms and a producer to develop a strategic marketing plan that will help this project succeed. The success of this campaign will help me to realize my goal of featuring incredible Canadian talent in paying tribute to one of the world’s greatest jazz artists. Personally, it will allow me to take my music career to the next level, to work with a well-established producer,talented guest artists, an innovative marketing firm, a creative publicist, and a dedicated manager to realize my artistic vision.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Team</h3>
<p><u><strong>Production</strong></u></p>
<p>Phillip Victor Bova of Bova Sound has put together a phenomenal group of musicians for the recording. Phil’s vision is to make the tracks hipper yet keep them lush with novel instrumentation and arrangements, while staying true to Nat ”King” Cole.</p>
<p><strong><u>Distributor</u></strong></p>
<p>CD Baby – will distribute my music on all the most popular download and streaming sites worldwide. With 95+ digital distribution partners CD Baby will get my music for sale in more place than any other music distributor. Also, with CD Baby my music will be available in over 15,000 record stores worldwide and on CDBaby.com.</p>
<p><u><strong>Management</strong></u></p>
<p>In talks with Judith Humenick Productions. (JHP) will work with, and support me as a developing jazz artist through career planning, management advice and a range of professional artistic development services, including analysis of performances and recordings,present markets and the tracking of audience and fan responses. This is ongoing process will supply us with valuable information as we work together toward the common goals of developing my brand, audience reach and artistic/financial success. JHP has achieved a solid track record in terms of the “company brand”, JHP artist name recognition, national and international performance contracts and bookings; and development of International business partnerships (including companies in the US, the United Kingdom, Germany and Asia). This work has resulted in a broadly based and growing network of business contacts and relationships within the established and developing markets of the highly competitive International Jazz world.</p>

<h3>Hello everyone!</h3>
<p>My name is Jay Terrell and I am raising money to pursue my passion in a music career.  I am 25 years old and have been creating music for nearly half of my life. Music is a very big part of my life and I believe that it is one thing that everyone in the world has in common, no matter who they are or were they are from. While spending 4 years in the Marine Corps, meeting many people and seeing a lot of the world, my friends and I all joked around about me having a music career when I got out. I parted ways with the Marine Corp June 2016. Since then, I actually have tried to take my music seriously. This led me to release of my first single ""Drinks Up"". Recently I also found out that my beautiful wife is pregnant with a baby boy! I would love to continue releasing and sharing my music with the world but as you can guess it is not that cheap. This indiegog fund is to raise money for me to be able to release my first EP. All of the funds will cover studio cost and the release of more of my music. Every contribution will be a blessing and very much appreciated. Money is not everything though and if you are not able or simply do not feel comfortable giving your hard earned money away I totally understand. Passing along the word will be just as appreciated. Thank you so much for your time and contribution! Have a wonderful day!</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>'Evolution' is about growth and change. This is on a mental, physical, musical, and/or spiritual level. There can be positive or negative evolution, which is a reflection of the decisions one makes in life. I wrote this album from the perspective of my personal  evolution, as a reflection of myself. The songs were written over the past year, each being written directly from the state of consciousness I was in at the time. I did my best to not compromise any of the music by overthinking and such, but to just let whatever I was feeling flow through me naturally. In that way, the songs are just who I am. I might also add that without realizing my own ability to control my evolution, the album and a lot of the things I do wouldn't exist. I want this album to show people that they can transform their lives and help others through the necessary effort. It doesn't matter how low or high you are, you can make the <strong>decision</strong> to evolve yourself to whoever you want to be. It just takes focusing all of yourself on that person and following your heart. This album and my story is meant to be a testament to that. With your help we will be able to achieve this project's full potential. </p>
<p>Osis consists of young and very talented musicians from Utah. That includes:</p>
<p>Myself (Tyler Webb) - Composer, Trumpet, Piano</p>
<p>Jacob White - Tenor Sax, Soprano Sax</p>
<p>Johnny Stallings - Piano, Wurlitzer</p>
<p>Ashton Young - Electric Guitar</p>
<p>Sebastian Arias Bonilla - Electric Bass</p>
<p>Chris Shemwell - Drums</p>
<p>Our music draws from many stylistic sources, which is why we call ourselves a 'jazz fusion group.' It includes elements of improvisation as jazz does, but also draws inspiration from funk and hip-hop. We do our best to please all ears, by including complexities in the music while maintaining a groove that feels good to listen to. Our music is meant for all ages and types of people, and we hope that through this campaign we will be able to spread the music to those people.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Fundraising Goal</h3>
<p>To do this project right, we are going to need a total of $5500. Broken down, that looks like:</p>
<p>Recording - $2000</p>
<p>Mixing/Mastering - $2700</p>
<p>CD Production - $500</p>
<p>Marketing/Promotion - $200</p>
<p>Album Art - $100</p>
<p>Creating an album like this is expensive, that's why any sort of donation is greatly appreciated and taken with love. Osis' wants to make it worth it for you too, so in return for your donations we are offering things like: digital downloads, signed hard copies, skype/face-to-face private lessons, a night to jam with the band, comp tickets to the album release show, and even private performances. Most importantly, we will be able to share our music with you.</p>
<p>As this is our debut album, we wanted to do it <strong>right</strong>, and that's why we are reaching out for support. Even if you can't donate, a simple share on social media makes a big difference. We appreciate anything, and we can't wait to share the final product with our supporters! Thank you for taking the time to read, and stay tuned for what's to come!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Chris Walsh, and I am an <a href=""http://www.latvia.eu/blog/loving-latvia-why-i-left-america-chase-choral-dreams"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">American singer and conductor who lives in Riga, Latvia</a>. </p>
<p>Music has the power to inspire action and draw attention to important causes and events, and the Middle Eastern refugee crisis is arguably the most important cause of our time. I would like to raise awareness for the crisis - to tell stories that show that the refugee experience is universal, whether it's Syrians in 2016 or Latvians in the 1940s. I have asked the <a href=""http://gabrieljackson.london/biography/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">accomplished British composer Gabriel Jackson</a> to tell these stories in <strong>a new commissioned work of music: a 25-minute classical piece for four solo voices.</strong></p>
<p><strong><i>This new work will interweave stories of modern-day refugees with the words of Latvian emigré writers from the 20th century.</i></strong> And though our work is limited in scope to the story of two refugee crises, we know that the words will be identifiable for anyone who has been impacted by the refugee experience in the last century. We hope that this piece will encourage audiences to reflect on what it means to be a refugee, and what it means to help.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Of course, commissioning and performing a new piece of music costs money. Though it doesn't represent the complete cost of the project, I am seeking to raise $10,000 to get this project started on stable ground. We will seek additional support in the form of grants and corporate donations to help make this project a reality.</p>
<p>Your donation will help to cover all of the costs involved in this undertaking: paying the composer for his work, compensating the singers for their time and talents, organizing and publicizing performances in Latvia and in countries impacted by the refugee crisis.</p>
<p>We've created perks that will bring our donors as close as possible to the creative process, offering direct connections with the composer and performers. We hope that these perks will provide donors a rare glimpse into the process of creating a new work of art and show how their donation is making a difference in the world.</p>
<p>Any money that we raise beyond our $10,000 goal will support our efforts to perform this new work for as many audiences as possible.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It is easy to go about our daily lives without considering how the refugee crisis affects us, or what we would do if we were placed in that situation. However, I think that many would be surprised to realize that the refugee experience is part of their own family history. It will soon be part of mine: my fiancee's grandparents fled the Soviet Union in the 1940s, and they met in a displaced persons camp in Germany.</p>
<p>As we connect the stories of modern-day refugees with those of 20th century Latvian refugees, we hope that audience members will consider whether the refugee experience has impacted their lives and their history. While this work may not encourage audience members to open their homes, we hope that it will encourage them to open their hearts and support displaced persons around the world in whatever way they can.</p>
<p>This is not just a project about the past and the present - it is a project about the future. Today's refugee crisis will not be the last, and we must all consider what we would do if we were placed in that position. How would we want the world to respond?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>While developing and performing a new work of music is a complicated process, Gabriel Jackson and I are experienced in bringing projects like these to a successful conclusion.</p>
<p>Gabriel's portfolio of works includes hundreds of successful, powerful pieces for a variety of ensembles. He has written works for the BBC Singers, BBC Proms, church and collegiate choirs throughout the United Kingdom, and the famous Youth Choir ""Kamēr..."" in Latvia.</p>
<p>As a graduate of the Choral Conducting program at Northwestern University, I learned the ins and outs of commissioning new works from Donald Nally - one of America's most prominent conductors of new music who has successfully commissioned hundreds of pieces throughout his career.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
My name is Chris Walsh, and I am an American singer and conductor who lives in Riga, Latvia. 
Music has the power to inspire action and draw attention to important causes and events, and the Middle Eastern refugee crisis is arguably the most important cause of our time. I would like to raise awareness for the crisis - to tell stories that show that the refugee experience is universal, whether it's Syrians in 2016 or Latvians in the 1940s. I have asked the accomplished British composer Gabriel Jackson to tell these stories in a new commissioned work of music: a 25-minute classical piece for four solo voices.
This new work will interweave stories of modern-day refugees with the words of Latvian emigré writers from the 20th century. And though our work is limited in scope to the story of two refugee crises, we know that the words will be identifiable for anyone who has been impacted by the refugee experience in the last century. We hope that this piece will encourage audiences to reflect on what it means to be a refugee, and what it means to help.

What We Need & What You Get
Of course, commissioning and performing a new piece of music costs money. Though it doesn't represent the complete cost of the project, I am seeking to raise $10,000 to get this project started on stable ground.

<p>It has been 14 years since I started playing the saxophone in my high school brass band. As a professional, I have spent 10 years searching for the sound that is ""me"".<br/>After graduating from the Shobi Musical College, I have been performing both in LUCA, the band which I joined during my time as a student, and also as a solo artist.<br/>I have experienced so many different types of music, and increasingly had chances to perform in Japan and in Asia as well.<br/><br/> </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">- Yes. It is also instrumental music with saxophone, but I would like to try a little bit different sound. I’m proud of playing with LUCA’s members.

<br/>What is Smooth Jazz?</h2>
</div><div><p>- Smooth Jazz is usually instrumental. In place of vocals, usually a saxophone, keyboard or string instrument will play a catchy lead melody, backed by a groovy rythm. Elements of R&amp;B, Soul and Jazz are found in this genre.<br/><br/>Perhaps not many people are familiar with smooth jazz, however there are actually many chances to hear it in cafes, shopping centers, and around town. In Japan, smooth jazz is not a major focus of magazines or TV shows, and it is difficult to consider it a major music genre. When I went to America in 2016, I was touched by how much the audience appreciated smooth jazz and felt showed a love for the music.<br/><br/><strong>I wish to take the lead and share that love with everyone.

<br/><strong>Message from Greg</strong>
</div>
<p>“I was cruising the internet when I came across a YouTube video of a young sax player. The phrasing and the tone of the horn immediately grabbed my intention. The fact that she’s cute as a button didn’t even enter my mind … ;-)</p>
<p>I later found out that her name is Wakana Inamura. Fate would have it that she had planned a trip to the Newport Beach Jazz Festival and it just so happened that I played there.<br/>It was the perfect occasion to meet her for the first time and talk about a future collaboration.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">I’m very excited to be working with Wakana on her new CD that is geared towards the US market. You can never predict how the audience will react to a CD, but Wakana has all the right stuff to make a big impact in this genre.” 　<br/><br/><br/><strong>What happens by doing crowdfunding?</strong><br/>- It will be a great opportunity to let the people I haven't met yet know my music. My hometown, Chiba prefecture, is close to Tokyo, and also a place full of nature.<br/>Of course, there is plenty of space for big concerts or events. If my crowdfunding is successful, I will hold events like music festivals and call together musicians from all over the world. It will  let a lot of people know about my hometown and my music.</p>
<p>In particular,  “Smooth Jazz” music has not spread throughout Japan yet, and it needs opportunities to be heard. I would like to take a lead in planning events or concerts. I think my first CD will be a work by us all together. I hope it will be something special for us!<br/> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>How to send WaKaNa's CD to people around the world.</strong><br/>- We would like to distribute this music to the world by using digital distribution systems like iTunes. Also, we will sell music at my official site and music sales sites both within and outside Japan. In addition, we will put CDs on sale at record shops.</p>

I later found out that her name is Wakana Inamura. Fate would have it that she had planned a trip to the Newport Beach Jazz Festival and it just so happened that I played there.It was the perfect occasion to meet her for the first time and talk about a future collaboration.
I’m very excited to be working with Wakana on her new CD that is geared towards the US market. You can never predict how the audience will react to a CD, but Wakana has all the right stuff to make a big impact in this genre.” 　What happens by doing crowdfunding?- It will be a great opportunity to let the people I haven't met yet know my music. My hometown, Chiba prefecture, is close to Tokyo, and also a place full of nature.Of course, there is plenty of space for big concerts or events. If my crowdfunding is successful, I will hold events like music festivals and call together musicians from all over the world. It will  let a lot of people know about my hometown and my music.
In particular,  “Smooth Jazz” music has not spread throughout Japan yet, and it needs opportunities to be heard. I would like to take a lead in planning events or concerts. I think my first CD will be a work by us all together. I hope it will be something special for us! 
How to send WaKaNa's CD to people around the world.- We would like to distribute this music to the world by using digital distribution systems like iTunes. Also, we will sell music at my official site and music sales sites both within and outside Japan. In addition, we will put CDs on sale at record shops.

 I had the pleasure of meeting the lovely Japanese Saxophonist/ Composer Wakana Inamura in Tokyo, Japan.Also I spent several days with her in the USA during Namm Week. Wakana is an energetic charismatic and skilled performerwho played with many elite Jazz musicians during the week at the Cannonball Saxophone Jam, Legere Jam, Innervision Records JamDarryl Williams Jam session and many more. Many highly respected musicians complimented her playing and she brought the house down wherever she went.I have also played Wakana's compositions on my Radio Station and I can tell you she is a gifted composer who writes beautiful melodies.Please support Wakana's project and help bring her gorgeous melodies to the world.Tevis LaukatPresident of Cannonball Musical Instruments“The first time I met Wakana was in Japan, where I shared the stage with her in one of our dealer’s music stores. As she introduced herself to me, I immediately felt her warmth and sincerity, which transferred beautifully to her playing when we were on stage. She is a vibrant, exciting player who has a gift for telling stories through her improvisation. We were also interviewed by a magazine while we were there, and in that interview I was very impressed with her comments about our instruments and how it helps her to express what is in her heart. Cannonball is proud to have her represent us in Japan as one of our endorsers. We feel that she has a very bright and promising future as a saxophonist because of her interesting approach to every musical situation.”Peter WhiteGuitarist,ProducerWakana is one of the brightest upcoming stars of saxophone. I love her soulful sound!Gabriel Mark HasselbachRecording artist and producer Wakana is a stellar sax stylist, unique to Japan, but competitive in the industry and ready to break into the world stage! and more!!Finaly I am not sponsored by a company. But having graduated from a music college, I have the confidence to do this project on my own.Wanting to play in a variety of venues, I have been performing not only at live house, but also on the street, on ships, on the beach, at restaurants, shopping centers, ballparks events in many places, and.Sometimes I succeeded, but sometimes not. Anyway I am very happy now because I can continue to play the saxophone and music. I want to express my life and character through playing the saxophone.First of all, via successful crowdfunding, I hope to create a very unique CD, full of meaningfull moments + memories,I will try my best to give you the benefit. Thank you very much for your support. Official HP : http://vvakana.wixsite.com/wakana/Facebook : www.facebook.com/WaKaNa.playsax（映像協力 8centi）",6.0,5,"1 Campaign

<h3>Cow Haus Presents 20th Anniversary </h3>
<p>In the fall of 1996, The Cow Haus, the now legendary Tallahassee live music venue, re-opened in it's new location on St. Francis St in the All Saints neighborhood and Cow Haus Presents was born! Brent Pitts, Brett Brewer, and myself, Brian Giblett, were the owners and I booked all the bands. Now, 20 years later, after booking shows at The Cow Haus, The Beta Bar, The Engine Room, The Side Bar and many other great venues here in town, we are celebrating with a series of shows featuring the reunions of some great Tallahassee bands as well some current bands who have ties going back to that scene. This kicks off with shows on Friday Nov. 4, Saturday Nov. 5 and Sunday Nov. 6 at The Side Bar!</p>
<p>In order for these shows to happen, members of some of these bands have to fly back to Tallahassee, and, since most of these musicians aren't particularly wealthy, we are trying to help pay for the costs of these flights, along with other show expenses, such as advertising, sound and lights/rental of the venue, and the production of Cow Haus 20th Anniversary merchandise, which will be available for sale at the shows and is also offered in perks that you can receive for donating here.</p>
<p>The more money that we raise here, the more of these expenses we can cover. And that means that more of the money that comes in from advance tickets and day of show tickets can go to these bands who have been so gracious and willing to put in the time and effort to make these shows possible, instead of only covering expenses.</p>

<p>~ Hello there! First of all, thank you for checking out our page! ~</p>
<p><strong>Few words about the band</strong></p>
<p>Bátor, Péter, Előd, Arnold (from left to right). We are a rock and roll band called Palma Hills. We started to play together 4 years ago in our hometown (Székelyudvarhely, Romania) where we attended at the same high school. At that time we did not really think that the music we make together would be so important for us someday like it is today.<br/>First thing to know about us is that we don't have any musical background, so we have not learnt music officially. (All we have done is trying to find our way around our instrument with the help of the internet based on our instincts.)<br/>From the beginning, writing our own songs has been the most important thing for our band. This is what we have always considered as real process.</p>
<p><b>Past recordings</b></p>
<p>We have released two EPs so far. The first one was Private Section, reliased in 2014, which included 4 of our earliest songs, the second one, We’re On The Way, There’s No Worry, was released in 2015 with 5 songs on it.</p>
<p>Our latest EP here:</p>
<div>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our new album and our expectations</strong></p>
<p>It will be our first full length album with 11 songs, but we are also planning to add some extras. <br/>Since we have always tried to get the best out of every studio record we make, it took us more than a year to compose these songs to find the most satisfying sound and to build a concept around them that makes this record an album that we can be proud of, even after years of time.</p>
<p>Until the lunch of this campaign we have recorded 6 songs of the album. We already released one of these songs as a single earlier this year, with a music video and we can tell you that we are pleased with the result.</p>

<p><br/>It is obvious by now that making music is what we want to do in our life. In the past few years we managed to achieve a lot of things that we thought to have been out of our reach, like: we played big festivals, traveled many miles while touring and met some incredibly nice people. Today we look on each of these memories as milestones of our journey. Our achievements and the love of music help us to keep going.</p>

First of all, thank you for checking out our page! ~
Few words about the band
Bátor, Péter, Előd, Arnold (from left to right). We are a rock and roll band called Palma Hills. We started to play together 4 years ago in our hometown (Székelyudvarhely, Romania) where we attended at the same high school. At that time we did not really think that the music we make together would be so important for us someday like it is today.First thing to know about us is that we don't have any musical background, so we have not learnt music officially. (All we have done is trying to find our way around our instrument with the help of the internet based on our instincts.)From the beginning, writing our own songs has been the most important thing for our band. This is what we have always considered as real process.
Past recordings
We have released two EPs so far. The first one was Private Section, reliased in 2014, which included 4 of our earliest songs, the second one, We’re On The Way, There’s No Worry, was released in 2015 with 5 songs on it.
Our latest EP here:


 
Our new album and our expectations
It will be our first full length album with 11 songs, but we are also planning to add some extras. Since we have always tried to get the best out of every studio record we make, it took us more than a year to compose these songs to find the most satisfying sound and to build a concept around them that makes this record an album that we can be proud of, even after years of time.
Until the lunch of this campaign we have recorded 6 songs of the album. We already released one of these songs as a single earlier this year, with a music video and we can tell you that we are pleased with the result.

 

It is obvious by now that making music is what we want to do in our life. In the past few years we managed to achieve a lot of things that we thought to have been out of our reach, like: we played big festivals, traveled many miles while touring and met some incredibly nice people. Today we look on each of these memories as milestones of our journey. Our achievements and the love of music help us to keep going.
We believe that this record will help us to get to the next level with our music. This means more touring inside and outside our homeland, showcasing, finding our audience and improving in what we are doing.
Bet that you are asking now: What’s the matter then? Go on and make things happen!The truth is that we lack the funds to finish what we have started. We’ve been supported by a program, called Cseh Tamás Program, who´s aim is to help young bands to start their career, so they gave us a certain amount of money for the making of this record but we did not managed to finish everything with that. Since we want to form this album the most monumental thing we have ever created, we need some more help to get to the finish line.Raising moneyWe would need 2000 € to pay for our last recording session, mixing and mastering and for the production of the copies of the album.Recording: We decided to record the whole album in Budapest, at Origo Studio where we can record almost everything live, when the band is playing together, because it is really important for us to make these songs sound like live music.

<h3>The DK Journey!</h3>
<p>Hey everyone! I want to begin by telling you a little bit about my journey. After 15+ years being a sideman with some of the most talented artists in the industry, I decided it was my turn to be up front. Two years ago I decided to embark on a new path. I put myself center stage and became a solo artist. Since then, I have recorded two albums which I am so incredibly proud of. I was also fortunate to fund both of these albums on my own. Both records gained much success on radio, including a single that made it all the way to #3 on the jazz charts. I've been featured in two major jazz magazines, gained multiple endorsements and have toured across the U.S. All of this success has landed me in the hands a marketing and booking team that is the best in the business.</p>
<p>So It's now time for me to record another album. Only this time we plan to create something bigger and better than before. We will be using one of the most sought after producers in smooth jazz - grammy nominated producer and saxophonist Darren Rahn. We will also be having some cameo appearances by some of the biggest names in smooth jazz. With this kind of vision, comes a higher price tag than before. We all know the music industry has changed. Less people are buying albums, more people are streaming music, and artists are not generating revenue because of this. So this can be a huge financial burden for indie artists which is why we have to find new and creative ways to connect with our fans and generate that revenue which allows us to keep making music. So this is where you come in.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>So ... What do I need?</h3>
<p>I need to raise $12,000+ to help pay for the production and recording costs of this new album. Yes that is a high price tag just for the recording - but this is what it takes to create a high-quality album that doesn't lack the musical integrity that I strive for. </p>
<p>Just to put things into perspective, I paid roughly $50,000 out of my own pocket for the last two albums I have recorded. This can make the process very stressful and not all that sustainable. Now, more than ever, is the time to keep pushing forward. My passion to deliver innovative and inspiring music to the world keeps me motivated. I am hopeful that with your help I can continue to leverage the success and ride the wave of momentum I have created to make my mark on the music industry. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>So ... what do you get?</h3>
<p>I have thought about this incredibly hard and put together, what I think are, some very unique and exciting packages that will allow you to be a part of the entire process along with me! From creating a cartoon version of you to star in a fully animated music video to a trip to Minneapolis to hang with me at my CD release party, I wanted to create packages that connect us together and keep you engaged from beginning to end.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Finally ...</h3>
<p>Please help me continue on this amazing journey by supporting this campaign and sharing with all of your friends and family. I have an amazing fanbase and consider you all to be a part of my team.  I couldn't do this without you. I want to thank you all from the bottom of my heart for your continued love and support. </p>
<p>Peace, love and music ya'll!<br/>- Danny Kusz</p>

From the entire SORI team, thank you for your support, and we hope to see you and your friends at our showcase event on Thursday, January 5, 2017 at Rockwood Music Hall. KEEP IN TOUCHDo you have questions, recommendations, comments or feedback?Do you have some great ideas and want to get involved?If so, please contact the SORI Director Shawn Choi at shawn@sori.nyc; or join our friend list at www.sori.nyc. (KOREAN)뉴욕에서 최초로 시도하는 2017 소리 쇼케이스! 글로벌한 한국음악을 소개하는 새로운 프로젝트가 실현될 수 있도록 여러분의 도움이 필요합니다. 소리 (SORI) 란?소리 (SORI)는 뉴욕에 기반을 두고 한국음악과 문화를 알리는 프로듀서 및 프로모터 에이젼시입니다. 2016년에 시작한 SORI는 신명나고 역동적인 최고 수준의 한국음악을 다양한 글로벌 관객들에게 소개하는데 목적이 있습니다. 우리가 소개하고자 하는 것여러분의 도움으로 SORI는 한국 최고 수준의 월드뮤직 그룹들의 쇼케이스를 뉴욕 최대의 공연마켓플레이스인 “APAP 컨퍼런스”에서 선보입니다.씽씽: 한국전통 민요가 록음악을 만나다. 환상적인 비쥬얼과 무대매너를 자랑하는 6인조 밴드.블랙스트링: 거문고 명인 허윤정을 주축으로 한 컨템포러리 한국 음악 그룹.한충은 밴드: 한국의 깊은 소리를 담은 전통악기인 대금, 소금과 기타와 퍼커션 등의 현대 악기로 연주하는 컨템포러리 한국 전통음악 그룹.APAP 컨퍼런스란? APAP은 미국 공연 기획자 협회를 뜻합니다. 매년 1월 뉴욕에서 열리는 컨퍼런스는 세계 최대 규모의 공연관계자 모임이라고 할 수 있습니다. APAP에서 쇼케이스를 가짐으로서 SORI는 아름다운 한국음악을 글로벌한 관객들에게 소개할 수 있는 기회가 생기고 미국과 세계 곳곳에 우리가 소개하는 한국음악 아티스트들의 공연 기회를 만들 수 있을 것입니다. 이 프로젝트가 중요한 이유는?음악은 세계 공통 언어로서 다양한 문화의 사람들을 통합시킬 수 있고 글로벌 사회의 여러가지 장벽을 허무는 힘이 있습니다. 이는 어디에서나 누구에게나 통할 수 있습니다. 우리의 프로젝트는 아주 중요한 문화적 의미가 있습니다. 이는 우리 아티스트들이 가진 최고 수준의 퍼포먼스 뿐 아니라 미국에서 쉽게 경험하기 어려운 특별한 한국의 문화를 소개하기 때문입니다.여러분의 도움으로, SORI는 강력한 힘을 가진 한국음악을 뉴욕뿐만 아니라 다른 많은 지역의 글로벌한 관객들에게 소개하는 동시에 한국 음악인들을 위한 지원 플랫폼을 만들며, 나아가 여러분이 새롭게 즐기고 크게 감동받을 수 있는 특별한 경험을 제시할 것입니다. 걸림돌과 과제들첫 시작의 가장 큰 걸림돌은 예산입니다. APAP에 쇼케이스를 위해서는 컨퍼런스 등록, 멤버십, 쇼케이스 등록, 부스비용 등을 비롯해 공연장 렌탈, 크루 용역 및 진행비용, 홍보, 교통, 공연비자 등 많은 비용이 필요합니다. 현재 책정 예산은 총 $47,000입니다.그 중 가장 많은 부분을 차지하는 아티스트들의 한국-뉴욕간 항공료까지는 확보된 상태이며 이 프로젝트의 현실화를 위해 최소 $10,000의 예산이 필요합니다.다음은 여러분의 도네이션이 어떻게 쓰일지를 보여주는 차트입니다. (위의 그림 참조) 우리의 팀을 소개합니다SORI는 뉴욕에서 활동하는 다양한 분야의 프로페셔널들- June (운영); Jeff (홍보); Bona (기술); Lina (디자인); Sua (사진); Phil and Junmo (비디오); Shawn (마케팅 및 총감독); 그리고 무기명으로 돕는 다른 몇 명까지- 자신의 시간과 전문성을 투자하여 프로젝트를 만들고 있습니다. 기부와 혜택모든 도네이션에는 다양한 혜택이 따라옵니다. 디지털 음원, 싸인 음반, 공연티켓, 음료티켓, VIP 멤버십, 왕복항공권 그리고 감사 메시지입니다. 캠페인 오른쪽 페이지에 기재된 자세한 혜택 리스트를 확인하세요 SORI를 도울수 있는 다른 방법들금전적인 도네이션이 아니더라도 이 프로젝트에 다른 방법으로 기여할 수 있습니다.● 2017년 1월 5일 뉴욕 맨하탄 락우드 뮤직홀에서 열리는 SORI 쇼케이스에 참여하세요.● 이 크라우드펀딩 캠페인을 온오프라인으로 소개해 주세요● 시간, 아이디어 그리고 여러분의 재능을 공유해 주세요. (아래 연락처 참고) 감사합니다여러분의 어떤 기부에도 진심으로 감사드립니다. 아무리 작은 도움도 우리의 프로젝트의 실현에 도움이 됩니다. 우리 SORI 팀원 모두 여러분의 도움에 감사드리며 2017년 1월 5일 락우드 뮤직홀에서 열리는 쇼케이스에서 뵙길 기대하겠습니다. KEEP IN TOUCH질문이나 조언이 있으신가요?좋은 아이디어나 이 프로젝트에 참여하고 싶으신가요?그렇다면 shawn@sori.nyc 로 이메일 주시거나 www.sori.nyc 오셔서 친구 등록을 해주세요.",4.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Few years ago I moved to Norway, and I had to start my life again from the scratch. Its not usually easy, starting all over again. I left my music (my dream) because I needed first to find a regular job and make a living, as music is hardly a full time job in Norway. This was a difficult decision for me. I came from a family of musicians and I have always hoped to be more successful than my uncles and aunts who were well loved for the richness of their voices back home. But I did not give up. I kept on believing that someday, somehow I will find my way back to my dream. It took some years though, but finally six months ago, life happened as it usually does. I started recording new songs. Then a Music video, and here I am today, getting ready for my first music concert in Norway. I am profoundly grateful for all the wonderful people I have met in this journey including you. I believe that people cross paths in life for a reason. Your help will go a long way in helping me realise this dream and I will not take it for granted. Music is what I have always longed to do. It means the world to me.</p>

<p>The main idea of ​​the concert is to encourage people to get their relationships to work so that they can grow old together. Because it is always best for children that parents remain together, respect and love each other and take good care of each other. That is also why we chose to have the concert in February (Valentine month). We planned this concert to give all couples who are there a good reason to renew their love and passion for each other. In the music video of ""Grow old with you"" we have used real couples who have been together for 4, 12 , 46 years etc. To show that every relationship is a journey . The inspiration for this concert came from my own personal experience after a broken relationship which has created a wound in my heart that will always be there. Now, I have found Love again. I just wish to use my songs to encourage everyone in a relationship. I want to convey the lessons life has taught me which is that one can always make an effort to get a relationship to work.

And this is how everything kinda started. I believe, that all forms of art connect us. It brings us back to the actual MOMENT.We suddenly open our hearts and minds to more than only rationality. Always seeing, hearing, feeling and sensing the beauty in everything we all are surrounded with,I found my ways, already by an early age, expressing these feelings through all kinds of art like sculpting, paper dipping, photography, acting, poetry and music etc. I'm Katrin Spiegel, and it wouldn’t feel sincere to me, if I would now describe myself here more detailed.I think, my work, my passion speaks better for me and I want to leave this space open to you to get your own impression and if you have any questions, I’m happy to recieve and answer them.  MOMENTIn February 2017 I'm going to perform & record my first album live, analogue, unplugged in Vienna, Austria at Casino Baumgarten, connected to the legendary vintage, analogue Preiser Record Studios.    It was always important to me - especially since the digital age, to bring music 'back to the roots' - back to this unaltered, genuine 'nude' sound. To have YOU, the audience, being part of the process, the making, having your good vibe on the record. And also giving you the space for interpretation, time to slow down and fall into the now, the actual 'MOMENT’. the Casino <3  With the Album and the way it will be recorded and left unaltered, I want to create an acoustical directness and intimacy that leads to an almost unbelievable reality to the listener. That's the beautiful 21"" tape recording machine on which the whole concert will be recorded. YOUAnd I would love to have YOU being part of the whole process. I invite you – and rely on you to share this campaign and my work widely -PLEASE SHARE it with your Facebook Friends & Instagram followers(click on the ""share"" links on the upper left of this page) -Send an email directly to people who care about music & art            COSTS & REWARDAs the whole project is also connected to high costs, I need your help! So I don’t end up being a starving artist :PAnd I made myself many thoughts about what I could give you in reward that makes you happy. Creating products with consciousness for our environment and one another is very important to me. Lead by that, I decided to only create products and perks that are less consume minded but therefore more experience creating and minimalist - focused & reduced to the core, low waste products. With your donation you help me cover the costs for the great team that is helping me to realize this project.IncludingPhoto/Videographer/Cut/EditingGraphic DesignProjectmanagementMusiciansWebdeveloperPRSound Ingeneers/TechniciansEventassistants Also, you help me to cover the costs of/forLocationcostCrewcateringEventmanagementPre Production e.g. arranging, recording, mixing, masteringProduction/Manufacturing for the Vinyl, CDs, licensing, copyrights, mechanical rightsMaterials e.g. for the artworks, special equipment, coversMarketing & promotion such as posters, postcards, advertisementsFees & Payment ProcessingFulfillment Any funding beyond this crowdfundinggoal up to 15.000€ will go towards the promotion for the album.

<h3>Who is this guy and why should I give him $$?   </h3>
<p>Hello!  My name is <a href=""https://www.stufuchs.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Stuart Fuchs</a> and I am a touring musician and teaching artist - these days I hang my hat in New Hampshire.  For over two decades I have been lucky enough to have made my living in the arts &amp; creative education...and for this I count my blessings everyday.  Along the way I've met some inspiring folks and have performed many styles of music...from Django Reinhardt's gypsy jazz to classical guitar, rock n roll, funk &amp; world beat, experimental music, and my own genre bending ukulele instrumentals.  For eight years I worked as a professional artist-in-residence at a cancer hospital and later received a composition grant from the National Endowment for the Arts for a healing music project.  I currently tour worldwide offering workshops, concerts and performing with the internationally renowned Sacred Chant artist Snatam Kaur.</p>
<p><strong>RIGHT NOW</strong>, I'm in the process of recording my 2nd solo album entitled ""After All This Time"".  I've created this Indiegogo campaign because I could really use your help to complete it.   For everyone over the past three years who has asked me ""when, when, WHEN is your next album coming out??!""...well, it's almost here!  </p>
<p>Your generous financial support will help me to complete this project - I'm poised for a late May 2017 release...will you help me reach my goal?</p>
<h3>You mean like in soccer?</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Um, well...no.  My goal is for $12,000.  My team and I have looked long and hard at what our goals are and feel this amount will create the best album possible.  If we reach this goal, you will have helped us to make this dream a reality!  </p>
<p><strong><u>Your contribution will be spent on the following production related expenses:</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Studio time for tracking, mixing and mastering this album</li>
<li>Hiring a highly qualified recording engineer for the sessions</li>
<li>Paying for professional musicians to add their talents to the music (and feeding them too!)</li>
<li>Hiring a professional graphic designer to design a beautiful package for the album</li>
<li>Printing the packaging for the album</li>
<li>Hiring a media promotions professional from a major media market (NYC, L.A., Chicago, etc.) to get this new music played on radio stations around the world</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If the goal is not met, thats okay</strong> - we will still use your contribution along with our own personal funds to complete the album.  If we <i>exceed the target amount</i>...those extra funds will be used to start the NEXT recording (60% of the songs for a 3rd solo album are already written).   </p>
<p><strong><i>We hope you'll join us in helping this campaign to succeed!</i></strong></p>
<h3>CD's?  Aren't those extinct like the Wooly Mammoth and the passenger pigeon?</h3>
<p>Nope, CD's are still alive and well - some folks still like to put on an album, kick back &amp; and listen all the way through (maybe you're one of them?)   Usually they're sold at concerts, then autographed and sold years later for a massive profit.  CD's sound fantastic in car stereos and even keep dust off your coffee table!</p>
<h3>What's on your CD?</h3>
<p>The music, like the ukulele, is both playful and humorous, soulful and deep.  This new album is a collection of beautiful instrumentals played on ukulele and guitar, uplifting original songs that explore themes of gratitude, wonder, loss, acceptance, and living anchored in the present moment.  I've composed music that sets the beautiful and inspiring poetry of the Persian Sufi poet Hafiz and Vietnamese Buddhist master and teacher Thich Nhat Hanh.  There also a few surprises on the album as well as my Didjeridoo and Native American flute.</p>
<p>""After All This Time"" is an album that will bring together some fantastic musicians and friends - and and a recording that bridges together two of my passions - music and meditation.  </p>
<h3>The Perks of contributing to his campaign</h3>
<p>There are perks to joining in this campaign, both energetic and tangible :)  As a thank you for your gift to this campaign, take a look at some of the cool gifts we're offering - they're listed on this page.  </p>

<div>I'm Shannon Vetter. I've been playing music for about 15 years. Mostly saxophones. Some guitar and drums and keys - I'm not as good at those - but luckily i know a lot of people who are. I know a lot of good musicians in general. This album features 11 songs I wrote and arranged that i sing and play on. This album also features 18 musicians from right here round Paducah, KY. </div>
<div>I think that's a pretty big deal. </div>
<div>With their help i made a really good record. I think you should hear it. </div>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>So why are you doing crowdfunding?Everyone does this and it's annoying.</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Well, making records is expensive. And i need your help. I've dedicated my life to music which as you know is not always the most lucrative of professions. If i was a lawyer I could probably afford it (but then the music wouldn't be as good)  It's being mixed right now by Jordan Lehning (Trace Adkins, Kacey Musgraves, Justin Townes Earl) I still have the mixing and the mastering and the printing to pay for.  I believe in this album, and I believe in all the musicians who made it with me. It's a good album and i need your support to finish it. </div>
<h3><b>The Money</b></h3>
<div>Don't think of it as a fundraiser. Think of it as a Pre Sale! You don't really feel how much these things cost until you're the only one paying for it. Gideon's Rifle albums were a breeze!  Alex Coltharp and Jake Siener may have been doing most of the engineering and graphic design work. (God bless em)</div>
<div>I'm spending around 7,500 on this project. That includes the tracking, mixing, mastering, and production of 200 cds and 100 vinyl. I'm hoping to make that money back eventually. But for now i'm trying to raise 3,000 specifically to pay for the mixing and to get some people interested in the album. The album was tracked right in Paducah at Loud and Clear. But Jordan Lehning (Kenny Rogers, Randy Travis, Justin Townes Earl ) Is mixing it. </div>
<div>He's one of the best. </div> <p><span style=""font-size: 24px;line-height: 30px;""><b>Why can't I just buy it at your show, in a store like cd central or terrapin station, or when i see you in person? </b></span></p>
<p>You can! But i could really use your support now. I'm trying to do stuff a little cheaper on the pre- sale so get the good deal here first and feel good about it. Plus we have lots of perk packages from amazing people and businesses from the area. </p>

</div></div>","The Deal
I'm Shannon Vetter. I've been playing music for about 15 years. Mostly saxophones. Some guitar and drums and keys - I'm not as good at those - but luckily i know a lot of people who are. I know a lot of good musicians in general. This album features 11 songs I wrote and arranged that i sing and play on. This album also features 18 musicians from right here round Paducah, KY. 
I think that's a pretty big deal. 
With their help i made a really good record. I think you should hear it. 

    So why are you doing crowdfunding?Everyone does this and it's annoying.

<p>Dear world music lovers. I am proud to introduce you to my first album of Persian/Flamenco music, which has been in the making for over 3 years. But in a way, it has been taking shape over many decades as I grew up in Iran and then found a new home in Canada as an adult. The Album is a unique combination of two deeply rooted musical traditions, Persian and Flamenco.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473495621/pldtu1mjzwjrkbcfqbzo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>It is my hope that I can give a voice to my fellow Female singers in Iran and also bring dignity to my place of birth and its kind people.</p>
<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<ul>
<li>My name is Farnaz, I was born and raised in Iran and moved to Canada in 1990.</li>
<li>I have always had music in my life but it was in 1998 that I started formally studying flamenco dance and music</li>
<li>In 2005 I started exploring singing Flamenco.</li>
<li>But in 2012 I understood that in order for me to find my authentic voice, I had to find my heart song. I had to tell my OWN story. And that is when I went back to where I have come from.</li>
<li>I began exploring putting Persian Poetry to traditional Flamenco forms, something that I believe I am in the unique position to create, because I have been blessed to have experienced both cultures.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472978020/s4dbpfrcfogpeo6e1nzt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This album is pure joy. It is a dream come true. Every song, has been chosen carefully, every word has been selected thoughtfully and there is a story behind every decision. Even the frequency we recorded at (432 Htz) has been carefully chosen. Why you ask?</p>
<ul>
<li>Because the album is the poetry of my heart</li>
<li>Because no other vehicle other than Flamenco would work for expressing all that is inside me</li>
<li>Because 432 Hz (a kinder, gentle frequency) would help the listener to let go and join the sound journey that this album is</li>
</ul>
<p>The album tells the story of restrictions put on me as a woman wanting to perform in public while growing up in Iran. Every note is a loud and definitive ""NO!"" to every no I heard. I am lucky. I was given wings to fly once I found my way to Canada. Many are not. Many women still battle restrictive, sexist, archaic laws that prevents them from raising their voice in the oldest human expression: song.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Hi, we are
Brooklyn-based bands Lazy Queen and LADY, and we’re here to ask you for money.
Both bands have come up through New York’s flourishing DIY scene over the past
couple of years, with plentiful of shows both in and around the city. The LADY
boys stem from Long Island, while Lazy Queen have members from NYC, Norway and
Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Last January
LQ had a blast touring Puerto Rico, and now we want to hit the road again.
This time we are setting our sights for the west coast. We'll be driving from NY to
Washington, making several stops between Seattle and San Diego in a 10 day
tour, before driving all the way back home. This is an important and big step
for both groups in getting out there and expanding our reach, and something
we’ve been dreaming of doing for a long time. We all have friends and fans on
the west coast that we are extremely eager to share our music and live
performances with.</p>
<p>Your support
in making this happen means the world to us all. Thank you for taking the time
to look over this campaign of ours.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>The main
expenses we are looking at on this tour are van rental, gas, stupid human needs
such as food and hydration, and the occasional lodging when we are not crashing
on floors or in the van. We are definitely not asking for the full coverage of
our budget, but by our estimates $1000 will
at least help us out with getting covered some of the gas or some of the van
rental, and of course, should we be so lucky as to exceed out goal, all of the
additional money will go to cover these other expenses.</p>
<p>But hey,
we’re not just going to ask you to toss money at us with nothing in return, so
we’ve tried to put together some neat little perks for you:</p>
<p><b>The Court Jester Package:</b></p>
<p>You make us
smile and bring joy to our otherwise joyless hearts. With this package you get
a digital download of both Lazy Queen’s Drift and LADY’s Washer. And our
eternal love of course.</p>
<p><b>The LADY
Love Package:</b></p>
<p>You are our
lady-loves. We love you. You get the same as in the Jester Package, but in
addition you get a signed gig poster, buttons and a physical copy of Drift on
tape.</p>
<p><b>The Lazy
Knight Package:</b></p>
<p>We knight you
a Knight of the IKEA Table. You get the a digital download of Lazy Queen’s
Drift and of LADY’s Washer from last year. In addition, by signing up for this
package you are preordering a signed copy of Lazy Queen and LADY’s upcoming
split EP. We’ll also add some merch goodies such as buttons and signed
photos/posters.</p>
<p><b>The
Queen’s Guard Package:</b></p>
<p>You are in
the most trusted circle of the Queen’s protectors. Our lives are in your
hands. You get everything in the Knight Package, but all three EPs will be
signed tapes and come with a digital download. We'll also paint you a most
lovely custom post card.</p>
<p><b>The
I've-run-out-of-package-names Package:</b></p>
<p>But that
doesn't mean that it's not a great package. You get everything included in the
Queen’s Guard Package, but we’ll also add a limited edition Lazy
Queen/LADY t-shirt, and as if that wasn’t enough to tickle your bones; you’ll
get the phone number of one member of your choosing from either band for your
own misuse.</p>
<p><b>The
Audience with the LADY Queen Package:</b></p>
<p>The Queen is
most pleased with your offering and sends us, her loyal subjects, to show you
her appreciation. We’ll come play your private or public event (as in we don’t
care if it’s a show you’re putting on or if you just need some background music
for cleaning your place on Sunday afternoon (help with cleaning comes with an
extra fee)) as long as it’s in a 40 mile radius from our home base of Brooklyn,
or along the route of our tour on the west coast IF we can work it into the
schedule. We’ll also bring with us some of the aforementioned merch goodies and
EP’s for you to flash at the gig so you’ll look way cool in front of your
friends.</p>
<p>If you can't
spare 10 bucks, it's fine, any contribution helps. And if you see us at a show
and can prove you gave anything at all we'll slip you some buttons and a hug.</p>
<p>It’s
important to us that you know that even if we don’t reach our goal the money
will go towards the tour. We will make this happen regardless. We’ll just have
to get creative about acquiring the rest of the money. I saw a solid YouTube
tutorial on how to rob a bank, so I feel like we’ve got that down at least.</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>We’re not
going to claim that this tour will in any way change the world, but you would
be supporting 8 guys in spreading music they’ve put blood sweat and tears
(occasionally of joy) into. And hopefully we’ll be able to create some
memorable nights for our old and new friends on the west coast, which wouldn’t
be possible at this time without your help. Your contribution will in a small
way help to keep the spirit of DIY and grass-roots art alive. Support you local
scene, and, in this case, support your local scene to reach other scenes.</p>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p></p>
</div>
<p>We get it,
life squeezes the very last penny out of your wallet, and it’s hard enough
without strangers and friends asking you to give them money to play their silly
music. But fear not, there are other ways you can help! Please share this
campaign to all of your rich friends. Indiegogo is asking us to remind you to
use the Indiegogo share tools, so yeah, go ahead and do that.</p>
<p>Much love
always,</p>

<div> </div>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">​​</span>​Hi, I am Adrian Weiss, an American rock and metal guitarist living in Germany and currently active in the power metal band <i>Gloryful</i> with whom I recently released the band’s third album, 'End Of The Night'. Before <i>Gloryful, </i>I was active in the progressive metal bands <i>Forces At Work</i> and <i>Thought Sphere</i>.</p>
<p>In addition to my band activity I began my solo career and released two instrumental solo albums, in 2011 and 2014, and also formed a trio to perform this music live. I have had the pleasure to share stages with many renowned artists such as <i>Christian Münzner, Victor Smolski, Animals As Leaders, Powerwolf, Accept, Hammerfall, Rage</i> and many other well-known acts with my bands and trio.</p>
<p>As you may have guessed, releasing solo albums without having a big name in the guitar scene is not an easy thing to achieve, especially since the production of music on a professional level is expensive and album sales nowadays are rather low in general.</p>
<p>Although I really can't complain – the press’ and fans’ reactions to my CDs being overwhelmingly positive – I am still quite far away from breaking even financially.</p>
<p>In the late fall of 2016 I am releasing my third instrumental album entitled 'Criminal Record'. This time I have decided to reach out to you – my friends, fans and supporters – to help me with the funding of the new album prior to its release, and at the same time to give you the chance to be the first to acquire the new album via a pre-order.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition this campaign will offer you the possibility of bargain deals on my previous solo albums and aforementioned band CD-back-catalogues of </p> <i>Gloryful, Forces At Work </i>and <i>Thought Sphere</i>.<p><b>  </b></p>
<p>             <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474200871/AdrianWeiss-02_mwbx7d.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 439.33px;height: 659px;cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>
</div><div>
<h2><b>What I Need &amp; What You Get</b></h2>
<p>I have paid for most of the drum, bass and guitar recording already, so the funds I want to raise with this campaign will mainly be used for the cost of </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>-<span>  </span>final mixing,  </span></p>
<p>-<span>  </span>the CD mastering, </p>
<p>-<span>  </span>the artwork (album cover, 12-page booklet, inlay etc.)  </p>
<p>-<span>  </span> the pressing of 1000 CDs, </p>
<p>-   costs of promotion, shipping etc.</p>
<p>altogether amounting to roughly <b>€ 3000.</b> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>By contributing to this campaign you will help me cover the remaining costs of the album production and be one of the very first to get ahold of the CD or download – several weeks before its official release.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 1px;font-size: 30px;"">The Perks</b></p>
<p><span>Your perks of choice will be mailed out to you as soon as this campaign ends - along with an e-mailed immediate download-link to the new album. The perks consist of the following items:</span></p>

​​​Hi, I am Adrian Weiss, an American rock and metal guitarist living in Germany and currently active in the power metal band Gloryful with whom I recently released the band’s third album, 'End Of The Night'. Before Gloryful, I was active in the progressive metal bands Forces At Work and Thought Sphere.
In addition to my band activity I began my solo career and released two instrumental solo albums, in 2011 and 2014, and also formed a trio to perform this music live. I have had the pleasure to share stages with many renowned artists such as Christian Münzner, Victor Smolski, Animals As Leaders, Powerwolf, Accept, Hammerfall, Rage and many other well-known acts with my bands and trio.
As you may have guessed, releasing solo albums without having a big name in the guitar scene is not an easy thing to achieve, especially since the production of music on a professional level is expensive and album sales nowadays are rather low in general.
Although I really can't complain – the press’ and fans’ reactions to my CDs being overwhelmingly positive – I am still quite far away from breaking even financially.
In the late fall of 2016 I am releasing my third instrumental album entitled 'Criminal Record'. This time I have decided to reach out to you – my friends, fans and supporters – to help me with the funding of the new album prior to its release, and at the same time to give you the chance to be the first to acquire the new album via a pre-order.
 
In addition this campaign will offer you the possibility of bargain deals on my previous solo albums and aforementioned band CD-back-catalogues of  Gloryful, Forces At Work and Thought Sphere.  
             

What I Need & What You Get
I have paid for most of the drum, bass and guitar recording already, so the funds I want to raise with this campaign will mainly be used for the cost of 
 
-  final mixing,  
-  the CD mastering, 
-  the artwork (album cover, 12-page booklet, inlay etc.)  
-   the pressing of 1000 CDs, 
-   costs of promotion, shipping etc.
altogether amounting to roughly € 3000. 
 
By contributing to this campaign you will help me cover the remaining costs of the album production and be one of the very first to get ahold of the CD or download – several weeks before its official release.
 
The Perks
Your perks of choice will be mailed out to you as soon as this campaign ends - along with an e-mailed immediate download-link to the new album. The perks consist of the following items:
 
Adrian Weiss - Criminal Record (CD 2016, 9 Tracks, 47:30 min.)
 
            
 
Check out the album trailer here to get more impressions of the new album!  
 
 

The Official Criminal-Record-T-Shirt:
 

         
   

 

In addition to my new solo album (digital or physical format) you can also get bargain deals on my previous solo albums and band CDs as well as my official T-shirt by choosing the respective perks on the right. My back catalogue contains the following albums (limited to digital format where indicated):

 
Adrian Weiss - Easy Game (CD 2014, 12 tracks, 53 min.)
Adrian Weiss - Big Time (CD 2011, 11 tracks, 47 min.)
 

Check out the videos below to get more impressions from my previous solo albums.
 
Gloryful - End Of The Night (CD 2016, 10 tracks, 46 min.)
               
Forces At Work - Straight (CD 2012, 10 tracks, 52 min.)
Forces At Work - Reverse Feng-Shui Audio Guide (CD 2006, 5 tracks, 30 min.)
Forces At Work - Forcilized (EP 2004, 5 tracks, 22 min. - digital only)
Forces At Work - Coldheart Canyon (EP 2003, 6 tracks, 26 min. - digital only)
 
 
   
Thought Sphere - Eos (CD 2002, 9 tracks, 43 min.)
Thought Sphere - Gold (Maxi-CD 2001, 4 tracks, 13 min.)
Thought Sphere - Vague Horizons (CD 2000, 12 tracks, 51 min.)
Thought Sphere - Eden's Shore (CD 1998, 10 tracks, 49 min.)
Thought Sphere - Grailkeeper's Gate (CD 1997, 8 tracks, 42 min. - digital only)
 

 


 
 
The official Big Time T-Shirt is also available:
 
 
  
 
Don´t worry! Even if I don´t reach the desired funding goal, all orders will be sent out as soon as this campaign is over, a good three weeks before the album will be released on Dec 16 2016.

</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>Long before “talkies” came along, a beautiful and amazing repertoire of film music was being created by gifted
composers, whose work went mostly unrecorded,
uncredited and swept away into obscurity when the silent era ended. <br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Often when people think of ""silent film music"", they imagine an
out-of-tune piano playing for flickering images. But in fact, music of the
silent film era was <i>much</i> more than this! During approximately the last 15 years of the silent era leading up to its end in 1929, live orchestras were being used in movie theaters, and a new art
form had developed in which some very wonderful, compelling and exceptional
music was being written to accompany films. But in
1929 it all came to end as theaters began to convert over to sound. And since
live musical accompaniment was no longer needed, this music became almost
instantly worthless.<span> Many movie theaters discarded their music libraries, and the composers of this wonderful music are mostly not remembered today. </span></p>
<p>Famous Players Orchestra believes this music deserves to be
heard again! We are dedicated to raising the public's awareness of this wonderful music through live musical performances with films
of the period using our 25 piece orchestra, as well as producing new recordings and videos so
that future generations can appreciate this remarkable musical treasure. </p>
<p>We are a non-profit whose mission is
dedicated to performing and recording this charming and long forgotten music because we feel it
is of great cultural and historic importance, not only as an indigenous
American musical treasure, but also as a significant chapter in the history and
development of cinema. <br/></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b>Our Project</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The project we are funding is a CD recording titled: “Music
of the Silent Cinema”, Vol. 1. The recording will feature our 25 piece orchestra
performing representative works from approximately 20 of the most notable
composers of this genre. Members of our orchestra are from among the finest professional symphony and session musicians in Los Angeles. The recording engineers, studio, post production mixing and mastering will be of top quality. Your contributions will help with the numerous production costs
of making this recording. </p>
<p>This CD will be our very first recording project, and we have
many other exiting projects planned for the future including unique silent film
releases on DVD and Blu Ray. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Here is a brief break down of our projected production costs to record:</p> <ul>
<li>$36,438. for Musicians (25 Piece Orchestra) <br/>
</li>
<li>$7320. for Studio (approx. 15 hours)/Engineer/Mixing <br/>
</li>
<li>$3100. for Mastering/Replicating  <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<b><h3><b>Our Perks</b></h3></b>We have some very nice perks planned for our contributors which will include coffee mugs, T-shirts, a copy of our new CD, tickets to our live shows in Southern California, and your name mentioned in our CD booklet. At Level Seven, for $1000. contribution, you'll get everything from the previous levels, plus you'll be our guest at a private screening of silent films with live musical accompaniment. You will really love this perk!  <br/><br/><b><b><h3><b>Where do the funds go if we don't reach our entire goal?</b></h3></b></b>First of all, we will make sure every donor receives the perks they were promised. If you were promised a copy of our new CD as a perk, but we have not yet completed it, the worst this could mean would be a delay in getting your CD. We will continue with every means possible of fundraising until we have raised enough money to complete production of this CD recording project.  Because of the enormity of this project, (and just to be on the 'safe' side) we are estimating delivery of the finished CD by May 2016. Of course it could be much sooner!<br/><ul>

<b><h3><b>On a Personal Note<br/></b></h3></b>
<p>Hi my name is Scott Lasky, I am the Musical Director of Famous Players Orchestra.  Thank you for checking out our campaign and I hope you will consider becoming a part of our exciting project through your support,<br/></p>
<p>I have an extensive background in music, with over 30 years as a professional musician, composer, and orchestrator.  My love for silent films goes back to when I was a teenager. My friends and I used to collect silent films on 8mm (and super 8!). <br/>
</p>
<p>It was around 15 years ago when I first came into possession of a box of old music which contained many silent film compositions. At the time, I was mainly interested in this music for study purposes.  But my interest and affection for this music quickly grew, and I soon found myself becoming a devoted collector of silent era scores, steadily adding to my collection over the years. <br/></p>
<p>As a musician, I have been continually impressed by the skill, craftsmanship and training of many of these composers, most of whom were strongly from European musical traditions. Their work firmly reflects values carried over from  the out-going 19th century which prescribed diligence, self discipline and a sense of duty.  I have also been impressed by how sincerely many of these composers felt about the importance of their work, believing that film music was not merely a commercial furor, but a genuine medium with great potential and promise, and one which should be taken seriously by every earnest, legitimate composer.     <br/></p>
<p>Over the years I have sought for a way to do my part in reviving this wonderful forgotten music. My dream was to start an orchestra exclusively for this purpose. Eventually, I and some other enthusiasts formed Famous Players Orchestra as a non profit, so that the public could take part in helping to sponsor our mission.  I feel very fortunate to have such a wonderful group of people serving on our board of directors, which includes some film preservationists, historians, musicians, an accountant and a college professor. We are a relatively new organization and we have a lot of great plans for the future. We recognize that others have done fine work in helping to revive this genre, but at the same time, it must be acknowledged that silent era film music remains a grossly under-served musical genre. We feel we have much to contribute to this cause, and with your kind support, we will! <br/></p>
<p>Please share your love of silent films and this great historic music with a contribution to our campaign.  Thank you!</p>

<h3>Will you help us?</h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<p>We have some exciting plans for 2016 but need your help with it!  As with most klapas, we self finance ourselves with a small amount of assistance from the city of Zadar.  We would be most grateful for any assistance towards our campaign and if you could spread the word!<br/></p>
<p>For 2016, our projects include:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Recording our very first CD.  We have already began the recording
 process and hope to have this completed by early Spring.  Check out our

 most important thing we have for 2016!</p></li>
<li><p>New Suits - we have been wearing the same suits for several years
 now are are worn and tattered.  Several of our newer members also have 
different suits from the rest.  We are looking to have designed suits 
traditional suits from the Zadar region so that we are recognized as 
a klapa from Zadar!</p></li>
<li><p>Assistance to finance our singing teacher. We need our singing teacher to help us reach our goals.</p></li>
<li><p>Assistance to help fund our travels around Croatia as well

<br/><h3>The Klapa Kožino Story<br/>
</h3> <p></p>Klapa Kožino first started out in 2003 and has kept the original way 
of singing Dalmatian songs without accompaniment of instruments. <br/><br/>At the beginning of 2012, Kožino experienced a “generational change” and has been performing in this new line-up since.<br/><br/>Its been an exciting and rewarding last few years, Klapa Kožino has performed at the festival ""Zlatna školjka"" 
(Golden Shell) in Pakoštane four times and received bronze and silver 
medals, and in 2013 it won the absolute golden award and the Grand Prix 
of the festival. In 2015, Kožino won the Grand Prix of the festival!<br/><br/>These last few years have been extraordinary, in 2012 after winning 1st award at Debutants’ Evening at Festival of Dalmatian

</h3>Klapa singing is a multipart singing tradition of the southern Croatian 
regions of Dalmatia. It was inscribed in 2012 on the  Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Multipart singing, a capella homophonic singing, 
oral tradition and simple music making are its main features. The leader
 of each singing group is the first tenor, followed by several tenori, 
baritoni and basi voices. During performances, the singers stand in a 
tight semicircle. The first tenor starts the singing and is followed by 
the others. The main aim is to achieve the best possible blend of 
voices. Technically, klapa singers express their mood by means of open 
guttural, nasal sotto voce and falsetto singing, usually in high-pitched
 tessitura. Another feature is the ability to sing freely, without the 
help of notation. Topics of klapa songs usually deal with love, life 
situations, and the environment in which they live. Bearers and 
practitioners are skilled amateurs who inherit the tradition from their 
predecessors. Their ages vary with many younger people singing with 
older singers. In ‘traditional klapa’, knowledge is transferred orally. 
‘Festival klapa’ is more formally organized with a focus on performance 
and presentation. In ‘modern klapa’, young singers gain experience by 
attending performances and listening to recordings. Local communities 
see klapa singing as a central marker of their musical identity, 
incorporating respect for diversity, creativity and communication.<br/><br/></div>","Will you help us?

We have some exciting plans for 2016 but need your help with it!  As with most klapas, we self finance ourselves with a small amount of assistance from the city of Zadar.  We would be most grateful for any assistance towards our campaign and if you could spread the word!
For 2016, our projects include:


Recording our very first CD.  We have already began the recording
 process and hope to have this completed by early Spring.  Check out our
 YouTube Channel for some of our recent performances. This for us is the
 most important thing we have for 2016!
New Suits - we have been wearing the same suits for several years
 now are are worn and tattered.  Several of our newer members also have 
different suits from the rest.  We are looking to have designed suits 
traditional suits from the Zadar region so that we are recognized as 
a klapa from Zadar!
Assistance to finance our singing teacher. We need our singing teacher to help us reach our goals.
Assistance to help fund our travels around Croatia as well 
another potential concert outside.  If you would like us to perform in 
your city - lets us know!!!

<p>Hello!</p><p>Thank you so much for taking the time to visit my campaign
page.  </p>
<p>About me:</p>
<p>I have been a professional singer for over twenty years, but only started writing songs about five years ago.  Living on my own and in a strange city (with no TV-YAY!!), I started
to piece together melodies with chords- and then managed to attach some
lyrics.  Coming from a classical
background, I didn’t know I could write songs. 
Since then, I have played hundreds of benefits and shows, been a finalist
in several competitions, played numerous music festivals and even had my music
featured in an award-winning independent film. 
When I’m not writing or performing music, I am teaching children and
adults how to sing and play guitar.  </p>
<p>This summer, I'll be recording a new album with full instrumentation and under the guidance of Jim Salamone (Cambridge Sound Studios). I am raising funds in order to create and promote the best-possible sounding record.</p><p>Contributors to my campaign can receive digital downloads, signed copies of the album, mention in liner notes, hand-written lyric sheets or even a house concert! </p><p>Thank you so much for your support. &lt;3</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>KAO=S
started in Tokyo in April,
2011
with Kaori Kawabuchi (Vocals / Sword Dance), Shuji Yamagiri (Acoustic
Guitar / Vocals) and Jack (Tsugaru Shamisen). Out of the turmoil that
followed the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, we distilled a new
style of Japanese art to bring to the world, which we called ‘chaos’
or, following the Japanese pronunciation, KAO=S (‘Kah-oss’).  
</p>
<p>Our
sounds combine Japanese traditional elements and modern Rock music,
along with musical theatre. We developed our music and performance
into a ‘‘Japanese Art Rock Band” that we're sure you'll love.
Our sound is a blend of vocals and acoustic guitar, overlaid with
traditional Japanese instruments such as the three-string Tsugaru
Shamisen. Complemented by Kaori’s spellbindingly powerful sword
dance, KAO=S has quickly caught people’s attention.  We have
performed at SXSW in 2012 and 2013, the Japan Expo in Paris, and
toured live in Europe and the US. In November 2014, we<span><span><span><span>
appeared on the CNN International program ""The Art of Movement "", and if you have a chance please take a look! </span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><a href=""http://edition.cnn.com/videos/bestoftv/2014/12/15/spc-art-of-movement-japan-rock-kaos.cnn"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://edition.cnn.com/videos/bestoftv/2014/12/15/spc-art-of-movement-japan-rock-kaos.cnn</a></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434362463/phsbtogze93g7ghf5lb0.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 590.59px; height: 511px;""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>So many of our fans and music companies outside of Japan have reached
out to us asking us to perform. We would love to take everyone up on
their offers and start bringing KAO=S overseas, but to do that we
need to put out a new album to coincide with an overseas tour. You
could help us to make an album that lets us showcase our unique
Japanese sound and spread our music and Japanese culture to other
countries.  We don't want to miss this chance -  we need your help to
release our album and take KAO=S to the world. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
We
are planning to record eight songs in the album. It is going to be
very expensive to record these songs at a level of quality that our
fans deserve. We decided to do crowd funding on Indie Go Go to raise
funds to that end. Please support us, and help us release the best
music we possibly can for you and everyone else who loves KAO=S.</p>

<br/><p><strong>What W</strong><strong>e Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
</div><div> </div><p>
</p><p>We
need funding to record music in a professional music studio, with a
sound engineer and musical instrument arrangement including various
traditional Japanese backing instrumentals. A professional
synthesizer programmer will be hired to clean up our sound for
digital formats. <span><span><span>
We will be recording in high resolution formats, and all tracks will
be professionally mastered to ensure the highest quality possible.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
If
we don't reach our target funding level, we won't be able to realise
an eight track album recorded at a professional quality. Rather than
lowering quality based on available funding, if we don't reach the
target we will be releasing a shorter album with fewer tracks, which
means you will still get the best music we can make at the highest
quality possible – just less of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Everyone
who supports us will receive a copy of the digital album through your
choice of iTunes, Google play, or other major online music
distributors. In addition, supporters who are able to visit Tokyo by

</div></div>","Short Summary
KAO=S
started in Tokyo in April,
2011
with Kaori Kawabuchi (Vocals / Sword Dance), Shuji Yamagiri (Acoustic
Guitar / Vocals) and Jack (Tsugaru Shamisen). Out of the turmoil that
followed the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, we distilled a new
style of Japanese art to bring to the world, which we called ‘chaos’
or, following the Japanese pronunciation, KAO=S (‘Kah-oss’).  

Our
sounds combine Japanese traditional elements and modern Rock music,
along with musical theatre. We developed our music and performance
into a ‘‘Japanese Art Rock Band” that we're sure you'll love.
Our sound is a blend of vocals and acoustic guitar, overlaid with
traditional Japanese instruments such as the three-string Tsugaru
Shamisen. Complemented by Kaori’s spellbindingly powerful sword
dance, KAO=S has quickly caught people’s attention.  We have
performed at SXSW in 2012 and 2013, the Japan Expo in Paris, and
toured live in Europe and the US. In November 2014, we
appeared on the CNN International program ""The Art of Movement "", and if you have a chance please take a look! http://edition.cnn.com/videos/bestoftv/2014/12/15/spc-art-of-movement-japan-rock-kaos.cnn


So many of our fans and music companies outside of Japan have reached
out to us asking us to perform. We would love to take everyone up on
their offers and start bringing KAO=S overseas, but to do that we
need to put out a new album to coincide with an overseas tour. You
could help us to make an album that lets us showcase our unique
Japanese sound and spread our music and Japanese culture to other
countries.  We don't want to miss this chance -  we need your help to
release our album and take KAO=S to the world. 




We
are planning to record eight songs in the album. It is going to be
very expensive to record these songs at a level of quality that our
fans deserve. We decided to do crowd funding on Indie Go Go to raise
funds to that end. Please support us, and help us release the best
music we possibly can for you and everyone else who loves KAO=S.




What We Need & What You Get
 
We
need funding to record music in a professional music studio, with a
sound engineer and musical instrument arrangement including various
traditional Japanese backing instrumentals. A professional
synthesizer programmer will be hired to clean up our sound for
digital formats. 
We will be recording in high resolution formats, and all tracks will
be professionally mastered to ensure the highest quality possible.


If
we don't reach our target funding level, we won't be able to realise
an eight track album recorded at a professional quality. Rather than
lowering quality based on available funding, if we don't reach the
target we will be releasing a shorter album with fewer tracks, which
means you will still get the best music we can make at the highest
quality possible – just less of it.


Everyone
who supports us will receive a copy of the digital album through your
choice of iTunes, Google play, or other major online music
distributors. In addition, supporters who are able to visit Tokyo by
July, 2017 will be eligible for special rewards. Please take a look
at the perks for details. All perks will be provided as listed to all
supporters, whether the funding target is reached or not.
    The Impact
 
We
are a completely independent band, and started our own production

<p>Hey friends (old and new), it’s the boys!</p>
<p>We’ve come from all around the world (Ireland, Turkey, the US) and found ourselves in Nashville, sitting on a bunch of songs that we’ve written that we love and have big ideas for. Wild Love has been a band for 7 years now, with different songs and sounds all along the way, but we really feel these new songs are the most ‘Wild Love’ we’ve ever been, and we’re so excited to share them with you. </p>
<p>We’ll be honest -- we don’t have a label, a manager, big investors, or buckets of cash sitting around (would be nice though), but what we do have is the visionary mind of Brandon, the business brain of Mike and the hard working hands of Si, as well as a team of amazing creatives we partner with like Ryan Yount (audio engineering, co-production) and Hannah Hall (music videos direction). We love our dream team, and we think with the right budget, we can give these songs what they deserve. </p>
<p>In order to give these songs everything we think they deserve, and make these songs into something that you deserve, we need a little help. What you can give will be met with t-shirts, handwritten lyrics, meet and greets, exclusive behind the scenes access, special content and more, and what you can give will specifically go towards the costs to record, release and bring these songs to the world, as well as give them a face through artwork and videos, and so much more that we can’t wait to tell you about.</p>
<p>And don’t worry, your money won’t just be spent on green M&amp;Ms or expensive outfits for photoshoots (we make Brandon pay for his own candy and clothes). We have been working with balanced, responsible and smart budgets for years now to use the little we have to make our releases as great as possible. Our latest album, They Call Me Kid brought us fans from around the world through with songs like ‘Tuesday Night’ and music videos like ‘Bitter’, and the singles we released in 2019 led to a performance at Nashville’s Live on the Green Festival (sharing the bill with Grace Potter, Lake Street Drive, Gary Clark Jr. and many more). We plan to have the same responsible approach, making the most of the budget we’ve got...the budget is just a little bigger this time around, and that’s why we need your help!</p>
<p>We also understand that not everyone can contribute financially -- no worries! We still love you, and are just stoked that you read this far. If you can’t contribute financially, you can still help us out by telling your world about Wild Love and what we’re trying to do here. Indiegogo makes it super easy to share this on socials, and we made that video above so it could be shared, so post it on socials or text it to some friends!</p>
<p>Wait...you’ve read this far? Thank you, seriously, even that means so much to us. We hope that you can take a few minutes to tell a friend about this, and give what you can so that we can send you a thank you note, a shirt, or maybe even give you a private acoustic show! </p>
<p>Whether you’ve been with us for years, or you’re meeting us for the first time on this page, we’re just so happy to know you and that you’re a part of this community. </p>

<p>Hi there </p>
<p>I’m Marcus Anderson, a contemporary jazz, R&amp;B, and pop artist that has been recording for over 16 years. I’ve released 14 albums as an independent which gave me the creative freedom to pursue whatever direction I felt.  </p>
<p>During the pandemic, I found it difficult to create new music and got the bright idea to do this album different from how I’ve done my others. Normally I write the songs, name the songs, record the video of me recording the songs, do the photo shoot, and lastly create the cover to name the album. This time I decided to start from the end work my way backwards and name the album “Reverse”, this Project will be released Spring of 2022.  </p>
<p>You may be asking yourself, why do I (an established artist) need to hold an Indiegogo fundraising campaign to make this album? With us coming off a pandemic and musicians not working for over a year. Starting new projects has been a challenge with me being a solo independent artist. Here are some major benefits as well that help complete this project: </p>
<p>1. The money raised here will go directly towards the making of this album and photo shoot and video recording of the making of the project. Since I’m an indie artist, this is all out of pocket. That’s right, all funded by just me. What is raised will be poured directly back into completing the project and post marketing of this album. </p>
<p>2. The more we raise, the more we can do to cover the cost of reversing the project. My costs include (session musician fees, production cost, horn section, string arrangements, mixing fee, mastering costs, studio rental recording fees, publicist, radio promotion, photo shoot, music videos, album artwork design, printing, other marketing expenses, etc. which all add up to well over $20,000.   </p>
<p>3. Lastly, at the $25 level and up, I’m going to include an EXCLUSIVE BONUS TRACK that only YOU will get via digital download, as I like this special treat as a giveaway. This song will NOT be released to the public, ever!  </p>
<p>My goal is to raise $15,000 here on Indiegogo, however, the net from that after Indiegogo and Credit Card fees plus fulfillment costs will be around $3,000 which will leave a remaining $12,000. Therefore, if we could raise more, that would be amazing!  </p>
<p>This is my 2nd Indiegogo campaign </p>
<p>And if you are unable to contribute at this time, you can still help ‘spread the word’ via your social media (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc.). Any mention would be sincerely appreciated! </p>

<p>This is where WE can use YOUR help... </p>
<p>In order for me to pay for the rest of the ‘Project’ costs (I’ll break it down for you shortly), I really need your financial support to finish it. Our projections show an additional $15,000 is needed to complete everything (my goal here on Indiegogo is $15k which covers the rest of the cost of Studio Recording, Paying session Musicians, Producers, Graphics, Comic book Printing, Animated Video, mixing, mastering. Since I remain an independent artist, I simply don’t have the deep pockets of the major record labels to do projects like this.  Any and every dollar given will greatly be appreciated and used to the completion of this Project. </p>
<p>Here’s the breakdown of where the money raised is going: </p>
<p>• Mixing of the music. </p>
<p>• Mastering of the music. </p>
<p>* Comic Book Pressing and design cost. </p>
<p>* Video Animation Creation to match the Cartoon. (including the editor and post-production.) </p>
<p>• Artwork &amp; Design (for both the Album and Video documentary behind the scenes and CD/Calendar packaging). </p>
<p>• Manufacturing &amp; Shipping cost. </p>
<p>•Marketing Expenses.  </p>
<p>*Musician studio cost. </p>
<p>*Producer cost. </p>

<p>* Studio Session Musician recording. </p>
<p>* Pre-Artwork and Characters design. </p>
<p>* Some Sample Printing for Calendar and posters. </p>
<p>* Some Pre-Video Behind the scenes recordings. </p>
<p>As you see, this is a lot into completing a finished commercial release. Obviously, there is a lot more to it than just putting out another album.  </p>
<p>YOU can help contribute to this project via the many ‘Perks’ available to choose from. Starting at just $25 all the way up to $8,000 :) </p>
<p>And if you can't contribute monetarily, you can still help get the word out. Please tell your friends, family, and co-workers about this campaign, and feel free to use the 'share' tools right here on the Indiegogo site. It would be so appreciated. </p>

Our audiences come away educated, entertained, and inspired for a lifetime of learning. With educational content that's delivered in fun, upbeat songs in a variety of musical styles, audiences of all ages are immediately engaged, and delight to the rhymes and music that never stops.Enthusiastically described as “Hamilton for the sciences” STEM: the Musical Explains the Universe! is the first theatrical production to receive the prestigious educational TrustMark, granted by STEM.org. The high-energy score features pop, Latin, techno, and funk (among others!), along with science and math content drawn directly from state educational standards.Follow four students - Stella, Tre, Eric, and Maddie - as they navigate their way through the STEM disciplines, learning important lessons along the way.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>If you are too busy for reading prose you can see all the details of the proposed concerts that we are fundraising for here:  <a href=""https://www.hennesseybrownmusic.com/concerts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.hennesseybrownmusic.com/concerts</a></p>
<p>Cressida and I were busy working as freelance musicians and played in Santiago Quartet together. In Santiago Quartet we put together a successful Indiegogo campaign, raising money to pay for the recording and release of an album called ""Language of the Heart."" As a result of this release the quartet played live on In Tune (BBC Radio 3), Front Row (BBC Radio 4) and Six Music, on the Tom Robinson show. Our investors enjoyed hearing radio plays across various BBC radio three shows and on Classic FM, where we got to number 9 in the classical album charts.</p>
<p>We raised money for MIND, Help Musicians U.K. and Oakleaf Enterprises, a charity in Guildford with the slogan""Making Life Work with Mental Illness."" Cressida and I played across the country with the quartet and across the world as freelance musicians.</p>
<p>Then a combination of physical injuries, parental responsibilities and COVID-19 persuaded us to start a music management company and dedicate the second part of our careers to helping other musicians. The devastation of the music industry and seeing dozens of friends having to retrain, give up on their careers and rely on government freelance payouts for survival was very sad. The emotional void left by having nowhere to perform was tough for us all. Being a musician is more than a job, it is part of who you are; your identity. </p>
<p>Cressida and I realised that we had to do something so we set up the Hennessey Brown Music Concert Series.  We managed to put on 15 events with online concerts, interviews, recorded concerts and a live concert to audience in our inaugural season, which coincided with the worst year for the arts since World War Two! Our motto evolved to be ""Making Music Happen.""</p>
<p>We realised that we were passionate about helping other musicians of the highest calibre come out of this crisis with work and a fully formed management company behind them. We set the concert series up to offer work specifically to musicians on our roster.</p>
<p>We also have cultural inclusion at the heart of our mission statement and are constantly looking for opportunities to promote and collaborate with women musicians, musicians and composers who are black, indigenous or people of colour (BIPOC) and to gradually diversify the socioeconomic backgrounds of our audience. As international travel opens up we intend to invite the Latin american musicians already on our roster to perform in the series.</p>
<p>In this series we are delighted that our own composer Dominique Le Gendre <a href=""https://www.hennesseybrownmusic.com/classical-musicians/dominique-le-gendre-composer-curator-amp-producer"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.hennesseybrownmusic.com/classical-musicians/dominique-le-gendre-composer-curator-amp-producer</a> Dominique has agreed to have her ""Riff for Strings and Snare"" performed in our International Women's Day concert. Plans to collaborate with Dominique and the Chineke! orchestra are advancing well. <a href=""https://www.chineke.org/chineke-orchestra"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.chineke.org/chineke-orchestra</a> This orchestra was set up by Chi-chi Nwanoku, specifically to provide opportunities for young black and ethnically diverse musicians in the U.K.</p>
<p>The season closer of our own concert series at Guildford Cathedral will also feature Cecilia Macdowall's ""The Girl From Aleppo"" with our violinist Harriet Mackenzie returning for the season closer. This event will have 100% women composers, performers and conductors. Your contribution will help towards the possibility of offering concessions and even free tickets to those who might mistakenly think that music is ""not for them."" </p>
<p>We will be supporting two charities by giving  5% of the funds raised in this campaign to Help Musicians U.K <a href=""https://www.helpmusicians.org.uk/%C2%A0and"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.helpmusicians.org.uk/&amp;nbsp</a> and collection for them at concerts, with online donations also possible. At the closing concert in Guildford Cathedral there will be a collection for Amie's Freedom Choir, a group made up of women refugees living in the U.K:  <a href=""https://www.pan-arts.net/projects/amies"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.pan-arts.net/projects/amies</a></p>
<p>We have no sponsors or members at the concert series as we are just establishing ourselves. We hugely want to enrich the cultural life of Guildford, bring music to youngsters who wouldn't normally be able to afford such concerts by offering heavy ticket concessions, and introduce people to a richer sense of diversity in the classical music of our area.   </p>
<h3> W<strong>hat we need and what you get</strong>
</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Your contributions will make the concert series happen, simple as that! We have to pay musicians the fees that they deserve, their travel, hire the venues, piano tuners, print and design for programmes, ticketing companies and more. If we are not relying solely on ticket sales to ""make music happen"" we can make our concerts accessible and affordable to the many not the few. From a solo piano recital at the United Reform Church performed by Fali Pavri, a violin recital with Harriet Mackenzie flying in from the Greek Islands to perform with Peter Donohoe at Holy Trinity Church, to a large celebration of music at Guildford Cathedral for International Women's Day. We will bring diversity, fun and accessibility to music lovers across the world.</p>
<p>The international side of things will occur due to the calibre of musicians performing and your investment into paying camera crew and sound editors. With High Definition recordings available we can bring the majority of the concerts into your home or even hospitals to sooth those who are unwell via YouTube streams. We can also gift video recordings of the concerts to friends and contacts in Latin America and beyond.</p>
<p>A close friend watched our last digital concert of the 2021 series performed by 'cellists Tim Gill and Joely Koos from their kitchen in a ski lift in the Rockies! We live in a different world in terms of accessibility and the potential for variety. </p>
<p>If you live locally or are prepared to travel to the Guildford area you can watch any or all of these concerts live, meet other music lovers and hear high quality music, or even meet the musicians between rehearsal and concert. More about that later! </p>
<p>Your presence will support the musicians and enable us to move into a third season. We want you to enjoy yourself so will be providing drinks in the interval and encourage all our performers to talk to you and discuss the music that they are playing. There will be an ""any questions"" section at each concert and brief talks about Help Musicians UK and Amies Freedom Choir, the charities that we are collecting for. </p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>These concerts will help keep Hennessey Brown Music going as a start up company trying to make its way as a music management company. They will bring much needed joy to classical music lovers, many of whom have not been able to leave their homes for concerts for 18 months or more. They will provide an opportunity to create funds for two wonderful charities and provide income for highly skilled musicians who have dedicated their lives to their art. Also they will help bring music to youngsters in the area who might not normally be able to afford to go to concerts. We will make sure of that by targeting State Schools and using our relationship with the wonderful Surrey Arts who provide instrumental lessons and much more for schools across the county.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are fully aware that COVID-19 is not just going away in June 2021 and that concerts and events might, and probably will, have limits on capacity or even have postponements. If this has to happen we will provide alternative concert dates and or formats to watch the events. This is one of the main reasons that we have gathered a highly professional and skilled team of camera crew, sound engineers and editors. If a date changes you are likely to be offered various alternative dates to come to a live concert and a myriad of free videos to compensate you and ease any disappointment.  </p>
<p>Sometimes musicians that are booked might be offered a tour or a series of concerts that they simply can't turn down. We support the overall musical development and careers of the musicians that work for us and would not stand in their way in such instances. IN the unlikely event of a replacement musician being needed due to illness or any other reason their replacements will be of the highest calibre and your enjoyment of the music will not be diminished. We know dozens of musicians across the industry and there is no shortage of demand for work, especially at the moment. So you needn't worry. If the government say there can be any kind of a concert there will be one.</p>
<p>We take your safety very seriously. All COVID-19 and government guidelines will be followed at all of our concerts and we will regularly use our membership of the Musicians Union and the Incorporated Society of Musicians for the latest rules and regulations.  We follow suggestions on Music Mark for keeping young audience members and performers safe at our events. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>In these times that have been so difficult economically for so many we are well aware that some of you just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean that you can't help:</p>
<p>Please share our campaign link with a friend or loved one that might be able to afford to help, share the campaign on social media, on Facebook Pages that might be relevant, Twitter, Instagram or on WhatsApp groups. If everybody that read this spent 10 minutes thinking of who might support the project and sent them the details we might just hit our target...</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and for giving us a good chance to keep: ""MAKING MUSIC HAPPEN!""</p>

If you have paid for a season ticket you will receive free tickets to concerts in 2022/2023 and our entire back catalogue of high quality recordings made in the 2020/2021 season.  

The Impact
These concerts will help keep Hennessey Brown Music going as a start up company trying to make its way as a music management company. They will bring much needed joy to classical music lovers, many of whom have not been able to leave their homes for concerts for 18 months or more. They will provide an opportunity to create funds for two wonderful charities and provide income for highly skilled musicians who have dedicated their lives to their art. Also they will help bring music to youngsters in the area who might not normally be able to afford to go to concerts. We will make sure of that by targeting State Schools and using our relationship with the wonderful Surrey Arts who provide instrumental lessons and much more for schools across the county.  

Risks & Challenges
We are fully aware that COVID-19 is not just going away in June 2021 and that concerts and events might, and probably will, have limits on capacity or even have postponements. If this has to happen we will provide alternative concert dates and or formats to watch the events. This is one of the main reasons that we have gathered a highly professional and skilled team of camera crew, sound engineers and editors. If a date changes you are likely to be offered various alternative dates to come to a live concert and a myriad of free videos to compensate you and ease any disappointment.  
Sometimes musicians that are booked might be offered a tour or a series of concerts that they simply can't turn down. We support the overall musical development and careers of the musicians that work for us and would not stand in their way in such instances. IN the unlikely event of a replacement musician being needed due to illness or any other reason their replacements will be of the highest calibre and your enjoyment of the music will not be diminished. We know dozens of musicians across the industry and there is no shortage of demand for work, especially at the moment. So you needn't worry. If the government say there can be any kind of a concert there will be one.
We take your safety very seriously. All COVID-19 and government guidelines will be followed at all of our concerts and we will regularly use our membership of the Musicians Union and the Incorporated Society of Musicians for the latest rules and regulations.  We follow suggestions on Music Mark for keeping young audience members and performers safe at our events. 

Other Ways You Can Help
In these times that have been so difficult economically for so many we are well aware that some of you just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean that you can't help:
Please share our campaign link with a friend or loved one that might be able to afford to help, share the campaign on social media, on Facebook Pages that might be relevant, Twitter, Instagram or on WhatsApp groups. If everybody that read this spent 10 minutes thinking of who might support the project and sent them the details we might just hit our target...

<p>Confinée 2020 is the product of two talented friends from different musical backgrounds collaborating on something new! </p>
<p>The main ingredients:</p>
<p>Jakub Szpakowicz: pianist, producer, dj and sound engineer.</p>
<p>Katie Kraw: Jazzy Vocalist and Singer/Songwriter. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Featuring the spices:</p>
<p>Natalie Nova - Rap and Vocal</p>
<p>AJMAN - Polish Rap Artist</p>
<p>Livia Ferandon-Bescond - Harpist</p>
<p>Juliette Boyer - Double Bass</p>
<p>Philip Maniez - Drums</p>
<p>Noé Berne - Guitar and Electric Bass</p>
<p>Jean Patrice Remilliard - Mastering </p>
<p> </p>
<p>How did ol’ jazz bones diva Katie Kraw end up making an electronic music album?</p>
<p>Let me tell YA!</p>
<p>Its June 2020 in Paris, France - I’d just been confined for a month furtively writing music to stay sane and to fill the roster for an upcoming project produced by Erin Costello (stay tuned for that 2021) meanwhile Rosabelle Selavy gets in touch and wants to make a burlesque music video with original music - I am thrilled to be involved in a creative project and excited about my pocket full of song sketches- I call one of my oldest and truest friends who is also a talented musician and producer: the incredible aforementioned Jakub Szpakowicz.  I go to the studio trepidatious and unsure about making electronically produced music - and within an hour we record Confinée our hot title track.</p>
<p>In awe of the rapidity, effortlessness and FUN of making electronic music with Jakub - I book the rest of the week and we record the basis of this album. Thrilled and invigorated by this creative collaboration we brought in a slew of our talented artist friends and had a total blast.</p>
<p> Followed by months of tweaking, adjusting, and re-inventing we finally have finished our first baby - born during the confinement(s) we are so proud to present: Confinée Deux-Mille-Vingt! </p>
<p>Jakub and I had so much fun making this project - we've decided to open our own music studio to help people like me make albums like this!  I cannot express how vital it has been for me to tap into and share the joys of making music and I’m looking forward to facilitating this process for other artists. Keep your eyes and ears peeled for Groove Lab Studios - we’re taking bookings in February.</p>
<p>Huge thank you to Mary Mulderry for the perfect Album Art and Teyama Alkamli for the gorgeous fundraising video. </p>
<p>Stay tuned for some incredible music videos featuring the mega talented dancer/ stylist/ performer/ loveofmylife: Fifi Fantome! Filmed by darling Nicolas Catovic and edited by our fave multimedia mogul Mary Mulderry. It has been such an honor being able to create art with so many beautiful talented folks during these turbulent times. </p>

<p>Who is ZXK ?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Z : Greetings ! My name is Zoë Despina a.k.a Zodëss and I’m a singer/songwriter musician !</p>
<p>I've been doing music for as long as I can remember.  The music scene has taught me a lot about myself and the industry. The struggle of the underground artist is real ; schedules may clash and projects can fall apart.  At this stage in my journey, I’m very confident with the project we put together and I adore my team. </p>
<p>K :  Yo I’m Nicolas Lajeunesse, a.k.a KOLA and I’m a multi-instrumentalist, singer and record producer.</p>
<p> I’ve been involved with music since I was a little kid. Going to F.A.C.E. Later on in high school I started making beats for my friends who were rapping over beats they downloaded online. In 2013 I enrolled in Musitechnic’s Audio Production program in Montreal which led to me gain a lot of knowledge and confidence. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>How we met </p>
<p> </p>
<p> We met through a mutual collaborator who goes by the name FREED. We made a song together and recorded a live video session of it . It’s called Ataraxia by FREED on youtube.</p>
<p>K : After working on this project together, I sent Zödess a beat. She wrote a full song with sick melodies and lyrics and came over to record it. It was a fun time laughing and making music and I knew then we could make great music together. Later Zoe suggested we make a music video and then brought in Rosalie to direct it. We met up with her and she had great energy and a super well prepared presentation of her vision for the video so we decided to move forward together. </p>
<p>Z : I had enjoyed collaborating with Kola on Ataraxia so when he asked me to work with him again I was happy to embark on this new project. As one of our songs progressed I became inspired to make a video clip of it. That's when I thought of Rosalie. We use to be roommates and we would bond a lot creatively. We even talked about collaborating on something together in the future. The timing felt right so I gave it a shot and she was thrilled to participate  !</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What the song ''Get it on'' means to us</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Z : The meaning of the song for me is about embracing my power as a wxman : Taking charge of my sexuality and honouring it . Owning my flaws , being unapologetically dominant, independent and a tease. I think it's a perfect beat for when you want to ''get it on'' if you know what I mean . </p>
<p>K : For me ‘Get it on’ is an homage to the classic Funk and R’n’b songs I grew up listening to when my dad played his music on our long drives to baseball games. But it’s also heavily influenced by Trip-hop from the 90’s where bands would have sexy female vocals over a dope Hip Hop beat. On the surface it’s a smooth banger, perfect for your late night hangs playlist, but if you listen deeper, it’s about feminine empowerment and fearless, authentic self-expression. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why a music video ?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>K :  The video is important for us because in today’s climate, with the music industry being over-saturated with artists,  we want to make an impact and stand out from the crowd. A dope video will be a great asset to accompany and enhance our music. Making a video is proof that we are serious about getting our music heard by all the people who could potentially appreciate it because we know they will enjoy it as much as we do. </p>
<p>Z : It would mean a lot to me to have the opportunity to make this video clip. I had so much fun writing the synopsis and I know for a fact that our director Rosalie will bring it to life beautifully !</p>

<h3>Our Debut Album Launch</h3>
<p>Hi! We are Mountains in the Sea, a husband-and-wife indie blues pop (is that a genre? we are making it one!) duo from Spokane Valley, WA. You all have been asking for a CD and we've been listening... so we are going to release our debut full-length album on 8/28/20!</p>
<p>Once we set out to release the CD, we realized this was quickly turning into something bigger than we originally intended. We believe God has given us the green light on this project and we are stepping out in faith!</p>
<p>At first, we set out to just make some CDs at home. Then we felt the nudge to have a run of professional CDs made. Then, a new run of limited edition t-shirts. Then, to release it all online, too. Then, to set up an Indiegogo campaign so you all could partner with us in this project and get some limited-time perks. So, here we are! Haha!</p>
<p>We want to help people and help light up this world with our music. We realized it's time to make it available for you all to partner with us in this project and help launch our music out into the world so more people can hear it. Your support will help us to make that happen. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1596990143/tm5rvibjrdsxolgvg50i.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Launch Details</h3>
<p>Our self-titled debut album will have 10 songs, including 7 of our previous singles polished up and remastered, and 3 brand new tracks:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">1. Beginning</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">2. Higher</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">3. Let's Go</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">4. Wavin' to My Haters</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">5. With You</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">6. Better Way</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">7. I'll Keep Running</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">8. Long Way Home</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">9. Thank You</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">10. Then the Rains Came</p>

<p>We are also excited to have tons of brand new merch you've never seen before, including a limited-edition T-Shirt exclusive to this album launch! (When they're gone, they're gone!) This brand new T-Shirt will be a white Gildan Soft Style tee with ALL of the album lyrics on the front and a big Mountains in the Sea logo over top, printed in an aqua color that coordinates with the album cover. We will have a wide range of sizes from adult Small to XXXL!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are setting a goal for $10,000 on this project. Making music is a very expensive process. This funding will be SO helpful to cover the costs of plugins/software used to mix and master the album, professional physical CDs and cases, brand new limited edition t-shirts, wristbands, hats and other exciting new merch, and marketing the album in the best way possible,  </li>
<li>We are offering some really exciting and super-exclusive perks you'll never see again! Click on each of the perk options to see more details about what they include.</li>
<li>If we don't reach our entire goal, the funds will still go towards those things listed above. If we do reach our goal, we will be able to get even more merch you guys have been asking for (like vinyl?!) and more. All the funding will go towards reaching people with our music in the best ways possible.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Guys, I'm going to be real honest. We want to change the world with our music. We want to light up this country and the world, help people, and leave a legacy in music. We are ridiculously determined and we aren't going to give up. We are going to follow wherever God leads, and we know He's got some really good plans.</p>
<p><br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are doing all of this without the help of a label. Over the years, we've made the decision to stay independent so that we can be 100% true to who we are and to our message. It can be challenging to wear so many different hats, but we love it. Your backing helps us be able to stay independent and get our music heard.</p>

Hi! We are Mountains in the Sea, a husband-and-wife indie blues pop (is that a genre? we are making it one!) duo from Spokane Valley, WA. You all have been asking for a CD and we've been listening... so we are going to release our debut full-length album on 8/28/20!
Once we set out to release the CD, we realized this was quickly turning into something bigger than we originally intended. We believe God has given us the green light on this project and we are stepping out in faith!
At first, we set out to just make some CDs at home. Then we felt the nudge to have a run of professional CDs made. Then, a new run of limited edition t-shirts. Then, to release it all online, too. Then, to set up an Indiegogo campaign so you all could partner with us in this project and get some limited-time perks. So, here we are! Haha!
We want to help people and help light up this world with our music. We realized it's time to make it available for you all to partner with us in this project and help launch our music out into the world so more people can hear it. Your support will help us to make that happen. 

Launch Details
Our self-titled debut album will have 10 songs, including 7 of our previous singles polished up and remastered, and 3 brand new tracks:
1. Beginning
2. Higher
3. Let's Go
4. Wavin' to My Haters
5. With You
6. Better Way
7. I'll Keep Running
8. Long Way Home
9. Thank You
10. Then the Rains Came

We are also excited to have tons of brand new merch you've never seen before, including a limited-edition T-Shirt exclusive to this album launch! (When they're gone, they're gone!) This brand new T-Shirt will be a white Gildan Soft Style tee with ALL of the album lyrics on the front and a big Mountains in the Sea logo over top, printed in an aqua color that coordinates with the album cover. We will have a wide range of sizes from adult Small to XXXL!


What We Need & What You Get

We are setting a goal for $10,000 on this project. Making music is a very expensive process. This funding will be SO helpful to cover the costs of plugins/software used to mix and master the album, professional physical CDs and cases, brand new limited edition t-shirts, wristbands, hats and other exciting new merch, and marketing the album in the best way possible,  
We are offering some really exciting and super-exclusive perks you'll never see again! Click on each of the perk options to see more details about what they include.
If we don't reach our entire goal, the funds will still go towards those things listed above. If we do reach our goal, we will be able to get even more merch you guys have been asking for (like vinyl?!) and more. All the funding will go towards reaching people with our music in the best ways possible.

 
 

The Impact
Guys, I'm going to be real honest. We want to change the world with our music. We want to light up this country and the world, help people, and leave a legacy in music. We are ridiculously determined and we aren't going to give up. We are going to follow wherever God leads, and we know He's got some really good plans.
 

Risks & Challenges
We are doing all of this without the help of a label. Over the years, we've made the decision to stay independent so that we can be 100% true to who we are and to our message. It can be challenging to wear so many different hats, but we love it. Your backing helps us be able to stay independent and get our music heard.


Other Ways You Can Help

Get the word out and make some noise about our campaign. Share this on social media using Indiegogo's share tools.
Pray for us! That's the most helpful of all.

<ul>
<li>Please see the cost breakdown below, my most honest and realistic perspective on the financial side of things. With your involvement, I will have the means to finish <strong>15 tracks and 15 music videos</strong>. The production, in tandem with the music videos, will happen in <strong>Pai, Thailand</strong> (pictured above, check out the last perk to come visit!).<br/> </li>
<li>For you, after a few months of incubation, there will be an <strong>exclusive super high quality download </strong>- way before the public mp3 quality release. That means all the songs and video in uncompressed huge format,  for projecting on the side of your house. It will also include more portable versions of just the audio.<br/> </li>
<li>If you choose the <strong>Behind The Scenes</strong> perk or  higher, you will also receive extensive behind the scenes material for learning and entertainment.

<li>Want to make your own music out of my music? By all means, do! I'm honoured. All songs will have <strong>remix stems </strong>available. (Coming soon.)<br/> </li>
<li>All of the above comes pre-loaded on the world first degradable <strong>8 GB wooden USB stick</strong>. Not sure if it's degradable though, but why would you throw it away anyway? These are going to be full of goodies, see details on the right. <br/> </li>
<li>If you want my <strong>original handwritten chord sheets</strong> for decoration or to simply steal my ideas, I'll happily send them over as soon as I'm done recording what's written on them. Will even put my signature on them, just as unreadable as the rest of my handwriting but it comes from the heart!<br/> </li>
<li>The internet connection here is surprisingly good for being tucked away in the mountains, so there's a multitude of ways to connect personally! I'd love to, in fact. <strong>Music lessons</strong>? <strong>Walking the dogs</strong> together? Interactive <strong>live-stream</strong> during the creation process? A tailor-made <strong>song and/or video</strong> for your own campaign, commercial or business? All possible!<br/> </li>
<li>If you are more of the listening kind, there is a package including a <u>VERY LIMITED AMOUNT</u> of<strong> handmade coconut speakers</strong> by my friend Karta in Chiang Mai. The first Bluetooth/ aux cable speaker I've encountered that looks beyond fantastic AND sounds like an actual high-grade speaker. </li>

<h3>Cost Breakdown</h3>
<p>It is always hard to exactly pin down the costs involved in something as multi-faceted as releasing an album, let alone an album accompanied by music videos.<br/>The breakdown below is based on <strong>15 songs and videos</strong>, with some of of the music already done and current production primarily taking place in Thailand. So the rent of the studio where I set my gear up, for example, is relatively low while the price of quality equipment not necessarily so. In the latter category, by the way, I accounted for an essential computer hardware upgrade, a new audio interface to expand number of inputs, two condenser mics, video equipment (depending on whom is working on the project and their own equipment), an iRig interface for live streaming and some auxiliary cabling and software for the studio multi-camera BTS setup.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi All!</p>
<p>Scott Edwards better known as D.E.F is a vocalist, rapper and multi-instrumentalist based in Nottingham. His output blends traditional hip hop roots, punk rock, alternative indie and a touch of grime.</p>
<p>Born in North London, D.E.F was influenced by his late Grandfather inheriting his musical blood, who taught him to play the guitar and piano. D.E.F would go on to discover that his mixed roots of Cuban, German, Scottish and Jamaican would be an indisputable musical force to his artistry. He moved to France at age 19, where he would learn to write and perform bilingually, develop his music and grow through life experiences. D.E.F is a dynamic, compelling and no-nonsense storyteller, sharing personal and collective perspectives. His pure but sharp penmanship and explosive energy invite audiences to experience an unorthodox musical thought-provoking trance with addictive beats creating a presence that is hard to resist connecting to.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need about £2000, which may sound like a lot to some, but in terms of music videos, this is still cheap. This is a non-profit production. The money will go to hiring professional equipment (Cameras, Lighting etc), costumes and props, location hire, travel and food expenses for the cast and crew (which there will be some 20 people as extras).</p>
<p>We are offering different perks for certain contributions such as; be an extra, signed merchandise, play a main role within the video and loads more!</p>
<p>If we don't reach the funds, then we will make the video with whatever funds we raise, so it won't go to waste!</p>
<p> </p>

Hi All!
Scott Edwards better known as D.E.F is a vocalist, rapper and multi-instrumentalist based in Nottingham. His output blends traditional hip hop roots, punk rock, alternative indie and a touch of grime.
Born in North London, D.E.F was influenced by his late Grandfather inheriting his musical blood, who taught him to play the guitar and piano. D.E.F would go on to discover that his mixed roots of Cuban, German, Scottish and Jamaican would be an indisputable musical force to his artistry. He moved to France at age 19, where he would learn to write and perform bilingually, develop his music and grow through life experiences. D.E.F is a dynamic, compelling and no-nonsense storyteller, sharing personal and collective perspectives. His pure but sharp penmanship and explosive energy invite audiences to experience an unorthodox musical thought-provoking trance with addictive beats creating a presence that is hard to resist connecting to.
 

What We Need & What You Get
We need about £2000, which may sound like a lot to some, but in terms of music videos, this is still cheap. This is a non-profit production. The money will go to hiring professional equipment (Cameras, Lighting etc), costumes and props, location hire, travel and food expenses for the cast and crew (which there will be some 20 people as extras).
We are offering different perks for certain contributions such as; be an extra, signed merchandise, play a main role within the video and loads more!
If we don't reach the funds, then we will make the video with whatever funds we raise, so it won't go to waste!
 

The Impact
Everyone has been affected by COVID-19, the creative industry is one such group. Being an artist during these times is difficult and other means of work is necessary. So, with this campaign, we hope to gain the funds to be able to make a true piece of art that will have an impact and last the test of time. 
This truly is a beautiful piece of work that people can relate to. 
 

Risks & Challenges
We have a brilliant team on board so far from local crews of Nottingham
Director: Kav Digva - who has directed music videos and many corporate and commercial videos
Cinematographer: Todd Franklin  - who has shot music videos, short films and corporate videos
We are securing more people each day as we are wanting to shoot the video in September. The clock is ticking, but we have experience and passion on our side to get this done no matter what!

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our Story</span></h3>
<p>Graber Gryass is a band from Memphis, a collective of talented friends centered around Michael Graber. Members also play in Public Enemy, Rumpke Mountain Boys, Devil Train, Bluff City Backsliders, Left Unsung, Dagnabbits, and other bands. Michael Graber recently played mandolin and 12-string on Foy Vance’s ""To Memphis,"" has released two recordings with Bluff City Backsliders, and also plays in Zeke’s Three Generation Jug Rascals, and Damfool, and has also played in Professor Elixir’s Southern Troubadours, Fatback Jubilee, and 611. </p>
<p><strong>Why Gryass?</strong> The last thing we want to do is be yet another average bluegrass band playing covers. Our influences are vast: the Byrds, country music from every country, all stimuli. Gryass gives us the right container to hold all of this combustible material. </p>
<p><strong>Why Late Bloom?</strong> After toiling in business and running a consultancy for most of his adult life,  Michael Graber wrote most of these songs at age 50 and celebrates that many people creatively flourish at this age. </p>
<p><strong>Why Spaceman’s Wonderbox?</strong> Band mates starting calling Michael Graber “Spaceman” because he is “so far out,” and it stuck. The Wonderbox holds all types on charms, potions, mysteries, and adventures. The songs go a little further out than those on Late Bloom and have different instrumentation: bass Erhu, dulcimer, harmonium, bouzouki. </p>

The purpose was to bring more music to the University and the Juneau community. The group was open to both college students at the University and to non-student members of the local community. Over the years, Alaskapella has fluctuated between its starting point of four members and thirty-five members (with choristers coming and going  in the group as their schedule allowed). Today we stand at an anticipated traveling number of eighteen members. Over the four years that Alaskapella has been around, we have performed at at least two major concerts of our own per year, various short gigs for local organizations, performances with other singing groups in their concerts, and we have worked to promote music in the community and at the University. All of this hard work, practice, and love of music has brought us to a wonderful opportunity (see “Carnegie Hall”)! </p><p>However, as Alaskapella is a group of both current college students with the University and non-student members (such as alumni and those taking time off from school due to various reasons), we cannot travel through the college (as the whole group) due to current University policy. Therefore, with the University’s blessing, we are attempting to travel as a group of individuals, hence the reason we are calling ourselves Alaskapellicans and not Alaskapella (the name owned by the University). Over the years, the pelican has become our mascot and our term to define individual group members, which seemed to fit with our current concept of a group of traveling individuals. We are currently a club under the University Foundation (a not-for-profit organization) and use all money earned through donations to represent the University and state of Alaska, provide our members with the best possible  experience (e.g. new uniforms, etc), and enlarge our music repertoire so we can bring a wider range of music to the community. </p><p>Carnegie Hall in New York City!</p><p>Alaskapella has been invited by DCINY (Distinguished Concerts International New York) to go to New York City and perform in an a cappella chorus directed by Deke Sharon (Music Director/arranger of Pitch Perfect and producer/arranger/and vocal coach on the Sing Off) in an international program/performance experience called Total Vocal 2. We were discovered by one of the DCINY employees on YouTube and the organization extended an invitation to us to come to New York and join them for the event! This is quite the honor as only the best a cappella groups around the world are invited to join in this amazing experience. Alaskapella is going to great lengths to try and make sure we can attend this opportunity, as we are excited to represent Alaska, the Juneau community, and the University of Alaska (and hope to further our group’s musical prowess to become a better representative for all mentioned parties). The Juneau Arts and Humanities Council has graciously joined us to help reach this goal in our fundraising efforts. For this event, we would be traveling to New York City in March of 2016 from the 17th through the 21st (with the 17th and 21st being travel days). This is so that we can rehearse with the other groups and Deke Sharon to polish our sound and the group in time for the  main performance (on Sunday, the 20th of March). There will be about eighteen of us traveling and performing in this event, but there will also be some VIPs (people who wish to travel with us, but will not be performing with us, a.k.a parents :P) who will be paying for themselves. </p><p>Alaskapella’s mission is to share our love and joy of music with the community and to represent Alaska (and especially the arts community of Southeast Alaska) to the world in the best possible manner.

And yes, you're right, I need your support!!
Always have been performing and writing music. Embarrassing yet humbling to look back at the old stuff and think, ""Damn, is that really when it started?"" Grew up as this weird band-Tupac kid who wanted to bridge the gaps between double-reed instruments and socio-political rap. And now? Found my voice/tunes within Elektro-hip-hop-pop. What does that even mean? I don't know...I am exploring it (;

<p></p>
<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Grace Moon and The Jaguar are a London based singer/songwriter, producer duo who have the complete package to achieve international success. They were formed when Norwegian/Danish singer/songwriter Sofie Eikelyn met French producer JB Pilon whilst she was searching for a studio to produce one of her songs for a Hollywood movie. Both artists are credited with creating a unique sound which they describe as Vintage Spy Pop with a cool, sophisticated and modern aesthetic. If Ian Fleming had heard them play he might have described Grace Moon &amp; The Jaguar as the perfect accompaniment to a vodka martini, but unlike James Bond’s favourite tipple, Grace Moon and The Jaguar will leave you shaken and certainly stirred.</p>

my life from the very beginning. Even as a baby, before I could talk, I was
devoted to opera, and it had me completely captivated. Mesmerized. Enthralled.
Enraptured. Words simply could not express the incredible beauty and the
powerful impact of perceiving so many different emotions at the same time, and
to such a dramatic and intense degree. They still can’t. Simply put, opera is
more than just a passion for me; it’s in my blood, and I need it just as much

<br/>
For more than two decades, I dreamed of nothing more than to be a 
conductor,
where I would be able to share my profound love and adoration for opera 
with
others, and to be in a position where I could inspire each of them to 
perform at their highest and most complete level. My dream finally 
became realized in 2013, when I began my involvement with Verismo Opera,
 a 
community
opera theater based in Vallejo, California, that provides wonderful
opportunities for aspiring vocalists and conductors to hone their skills
 as
they pursue professional careers at the major opera companies. While 
studying
cello at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, I was very privileged 
to
conduct fully-staged productions of La Traviata, Rigoletto, Carmen, and 
La
Boheme at Verismo, and it is with enormous anticipation that I look 
forward to
conducting their upcoming production of Faust this summer. </p>
<p>What has made my experiences at
Verismo so heartwarming is hearing and seeing the enthusiastic responses from

</p><p>Specifically, Verismo has major gaps in two critical areas:</p>
<p>1) 
the need for additional orchestral musicians to fully serve
the composition's musical demands; and</p>
<p>2)  the need for additional rehearsals with the orchestra well before opening
night.</p>
<p>Verismo’s limited budget has
precluded us from being able to meet these challenges. This is despite
principal singers, chorus members, and conductors such as myself electing to
perform on a volunteer basis. And with rehearsals scheduled to begin in July
for our upcoming production of Faust in August, we have an imminent priority to secure
funding that would cover both of these necessities in time.</p>
<p>I
 reach out to you in the sincere hope
that you could kindly make a donation to Verismo as it enters its Summer

<li>I'm a singer, songwriter and blues guitarist from the UK and am independently recording my 3rd studio album. I was born into a musical family. My late father was the legendary producer Andy Johns who worked on Free, Led Zep, Clapton and The Rolling Stones to name a few. 'Uncle Glyn' Johns is also a world renowned Producer.(Eagles,The Who)<br/>I started playing guitar at 15 and recieved huge encouragement from my uncle Eric Clapton, I remember my other uncle Mick Fleetwood used to keep us in line as kids, threatening us with 'The High Jump'!  <br/>Surrounded by such great influences I would say it was only natural that I became a musician myself.  It was either that or become a pro fisherman which is my other passion - I am actually The All England Squid Fishing Champion 2014!</li>
<li> I've been nominated 3 times in the British Blues Awards and have recently toured the UK, Russia and the Crimea. Next year I'll be in Europe and the Czech Republic.  </li>
<li>I also perform in 'Fresh Cream' with Malcolm Bruce and Chris Page and am looking forward to touring with them later in 2016 when we celebrate 50 years of CREAM's music! </li>
</ul>
<ul><li>I'm well on the way to finishing my third solo album 'Something Old, Something New..'  and I would really appreciate your help to raise the funds to cover the costs of finishing recording, mixing and releasing my creation in early spring of 2016. It would mean the world to me to achieve this goal and be able to share my latest work.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>By contributing to this project you will be helping me to bring my music to a much larger audience. The song 'Last Page' from the album has already received airplay on radio stations across the world and the feedback and interest has been brilliant!  You can check out the video here : <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FTpejoFPuY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FTpejoFPuY</a>

 My name is Will Johns...




I'm a singer, songwriter and blues guitarist from the UK and am independently recording my 3rd studio album. I was born into a musical family. My late father was the legendary producer Andy Johns who worked on Free, Led Zep, Clapton and The Rolling Stones to name a few. 'Uncle Glyn' Johns is also a world renowned Producer.(Eagles,The Who)I started playing guitar at 15 and recieved huge encouragement from my uncle Eric Clapton, I remember my other uncle Mick Fleetwood used to keep us in line as kids, threatening us with 'The High Jump'!  Surrounded by such great influences I would say it was only natural that I became a musician myself.  It was either that or become a pro fisherman which is my other passion - I am actually The All England Squid Fishing Champion 2014!
 I've been nominated 3 times in the British Blues Awards and have recently toured the UK, Russia and the Crimea. Next year I'll be in Europe and the Czech Republic.  
I also perform in 'Fresh Cream' with Malcolm Bruce and Chris Page and am looking forward to touring with them later in 2016 when we celebrate 50 years of CREAM's music! 

I'm well on the way to finishing my third solo album 'Something Old, Something New..'  and I would really appreciate your help to raise the funds to cover the costs of finishing recording, mixing and releasing my creation in early spring of 2016. It would mean the world to me to achieve this goal and be able to share my latest work.

By contributing to this project you will be helping me to bring my music to a much larger audience. The song 'Last Page' from the album has already received airplay on radio stations across the world and the feedback and interest has been brilliant!  You can check out the video here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FTpejoFPuY



A  UK tour is planned for March & April to promote the Album and a release party in Richmond, Surrey at The Crawdaddy Club will be a truly amazing  event with YOUR help!

<p><b>Introduction:</b></p><p>Hello, my name is Lawrence Park and I am here to invite you
to join the creation of my first 5 song EP - through this Indiegogo Campaign</p>
<p>I am a singer / songwriter currently located
in San Diego, CA.  And my passion and love for singing really took off
when I met my vocal coach Ken Anderson, who is a Gospel Choir Professor. 
And My sound is very much influenced by him and his gospel roots as he has been
mentoring me since 2010. </p>
<p>And I just want to highlight a quick little
story about him. When I was going through a really rough time, he would call me
every single morning...for over a year... once again... every single morning
for over a whole year... to uplift me, encourage me, motivate me and really be
that one person that did not only truly believe in me, but more importantly...
someone that just loved me for who I was.  </p><p><b>What Lawrence Wants To Do With His Original Music:</b></p>
<p>And that is what I want to do with my Original
music.  I want to uplift, I want to encourage, I want to motivate and I
want to love people through the music I create and write.  So Wouldn't it
be awesome if you were part of that?  </p>
<p>When you go through rough times, and the
inconvenient truth is that... you will... I want my music to be an option or an
avenue where you can cope, recover and really feel that somebody understands
your pain that you're going through.  And that there is light at the end
of the tunnel and that things are eventually going to be ok.</p>
<p>And on the flip side, if you are feeling good,
I want my music to help you keep it that way.</p><p><b>What YOU Can Get Out Of Supporting Lawrence (look to the right): -------&gt;</b></p>
<p>But there is only so much I can do on my
own.  That is why I am letting you know that ALL funds will go directly to
the production of the EP in a professional music studio.  So Please help
support the funding of my new EP and in return you can receive one of these fun
rewards displayed on the right of your screen.  If you can't find
it in your means to give... its all good... just do me a favor and share this
link on your social media platforms... But if you can give anything at all,
please do... Because even $5 can make a huge difference in reaching my goal.  </p>
<p><b>Thank You For Being A Part Of The Team #TeamLP #LawrenceParkMusic</b></p><p>So Thank you for taking your time to watch
this short clip.  It is really important and special for me in being able
to complete this EP in a beautiful and collective way.  And I really hope
you join in on the creation to help uplift, motivate, encourage and just love
on people.  Thank you.</p>

</h3><h3>My Grand Adventure.</h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>One day right after I quit my job to work on music full time, I sat down to meditate. I had meditated before but this time I meditated and then I prayed and it felt so good. I did that for 2 months for a couple hours each day. And I did it for no reason but that it felt good. Cleansing. </h3>
<h3>But I did not know what prayer was for really. I know it was good. But sometimes something good for you is not meant to be done with the intensity with which I did it. But the main thing I learned is that prayer is for the healing of the mind. So things happened, some good, some not so good and more good.</h3>
<h3>And one of those good things are the songs I have written!</h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>My grand adventure is all about letting go of my inhibitions and living an extraordinary life. I have been given this opportunity through these songs that I have written because I cannot imagine not recording and singing them! Meaning, I am compelled to share. </h3>
<h3>As a piano player I played because it was just what I did. I wrote music. And that is what I did. </h3>
<h3>But these songs which I've written, they seem to need to be sung. And as I am working on them I really enjoy it and the time it takes because I am realizing that all of life is really about enjoying what's placed in front of us, a grand adventure. And now, after experiencing things which may not have been the best for me at the time, an adventure is all I can imagine life to be because if it is not an adventure then what is it?</h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>And right now anything other than a joyful adventurous life is what I am releasing! You see my inhibitions have kept me back from living life fully and I refuse to let that continue to rule me. Is it difficult letting go? Well yes! Letting go is not that easy. So I just take it one day at a time. I know all will be done in God's time. </h3>
<h3>What's God's timing mean to me? </h3>
<h3>Divine timing. The present. The now moment. </h3>
<h3>And how do I work on releasing my inhibitions? </h3>
<h3>By saying, All there is is love, and steeping myself in calmness, peace and silence and wham there it is, freedom!</h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>This is my big adventure! </h3>

Not for any particular reason. But the truth is I always really wanted to play the guitar. When I was very young, my two older sisters had guitar lessons. And I thought that when I was old enough, I would have them too. But just when I thought I would start, the guitar teacher moved away. So instead, I started taking piano lessons with another teacher, Mr. Charles, on the third floor of Charles Music Studio in Brooklyn, NY.</b></span><span style=""line-height: 26px; font-size: 16px;"">
<p><b></b><br/></p>
<p><b>So I continued to play the piano. I studied music at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, because I could not think of anything else I wanted to do. I got a degree in Music Theory and Composition and I’m a pretty good composer. I even won our senior year composition contest, and I was pretty happy about that. Eventually, I produced 3 solo piano CDs generating good reviews. I wanted to release others, but between my job (I worked at a record company in Universal City), and my social life, I just never got around to making any more.</b></p>
<p><b><br/>
</b></p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><b>Currently . . .</b></span></p>
<p><b>Fast forward to now – I’m playing the guitar.   </b></p>
<p><b></b><br/></p>
<p><b>I am a musician with a new and different vision for myself! My vision is to record 12 to 15 of the songs I have written over the past 2 or more years. The difference is these are singer/songwriter tunes written for guitar with vocals – me! This will be the first time that I will release an album with me as a singer. I am both exhilarated and apprehensive, but mostly living on trust and faith that my dream will come true. </b></p>
<p><b></b><br/></p>
<p><b>Recently, I've written over 25 songs for guitar and voice – 12 are completely the way I like them and I am working on three more to include in my album entitled, Everyone Is the Light! These songs are inspirational and heart opening. </b></p>
<p><b>Singing and playing the guitar has been fun, rewarding, and just really cool! And I'd like to share these songs with everyone. But right now it’s a challenge for me to record them. And that’s because to do a great and professional job and to produce a quality album will take some time and lots of expense. </b></p>
<p><b>With my three solo piano CDs, I did a lot of the upfront work in my home studio, which was fine. This time, however, I want a higher quality sound which leads  to greater listening pleasure for you, the audience. And I cannot do it on my own. This can best be achieved by inviting other professional musicians such as a drummer, bassist, and maybe another guitarist to accompany me in the studio. </b></p>
<p><b></b><br/></p>
<p><b>$25,000 will help with the following expenses:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Studio Time</b></li>
<li><b>Musician Fees</b></li>
<li><b>Record Mastering</b></li>
<li><b>Website Development &amp; Social Media Management</b></li>
<li><b>Download Site Fees &amp; Administration </b></li>
<li><b>Launch Events</b></li>
<li><b>Performance Space</b></li>
<li><b>Perk Fulfillment</b></li>
<li><b>PR Announcements/Press Releases</b></li>

<p><b>So, I’ve organized this crowdfunding campaign to generate income to record, mix, and master these singer/songwriter tracks and I’m asking you to help me fund the project. As a thank-you for all contributions $10.00 and more, you will receive a download of my new album, Everyone Is the Light! and other perks listed for various contribution levels. Please add a perk if you'd like one – I will gladly send it to you! </b></p>
<p><b></b><br/></p>
<p><b>I’m going for the gusto!</b></p>
<p><b>I’m really excited about this and at the same time a bit nervous. But I know it will all turn out great – with your help and support, I will succeed. Won’t you please share your light with me and help me get my new album recorded? Please say YES!</b></p>

My grand adventure is all about letting go of my inhibitions and living an extraordinary life. I have been given this opportunity through these songs that I have written because I cannot imagine not recording and singing them! Meaning, I am compelled to share. 
As a piano player I played because it was just what I did. I wrote music. And that is what I did. 
But these songs which I've written, they seem to need to be sung. And as I am working on them I really enjoy it and the time it takes because I am realizing that all of life is really about enjoying what's placed in front of us, a grand adventure. And now, after experiencing things which may not have been the best for me at the time, an adventure is all I can imagine life to be because if it is not an adventure then what is it?

And right now anything other than a joyful adventurous life is what I am releasing! You see my inhibitions have kept me back from living life fully and I refuse to let that continue to rule me. Is it difficult letting go? Well yes! Letting go is not that easy. So I just take it one day at a time. I know all will be done in God's time. 
What's God's timing mean to me? 
Divine timing. The present. The now moment. 
And how do I work on releasing my inhibitions? 
By saying, All there is is love, and steeping myself in calmness, peace and silence and wham there it is, freedom!

This is my big adventure! 
 


My Backstory
I’ve been playing the piano since I was 9 years old.And now, all of a sudden, I don’t want to play it as much. Not for any particular reason. But the truth is I always really wanted to play the guitar. When I was very young, my two older sisters had guitar lessons. And I thought that when I was old enough, I would have them too. But just when I thought I would start, the guitar teacher moved away. So instead, I started taking piano lessons with another teacher, Mr. Charles, on the third floor of Charles Music Studio in Brooklyn, NY.

So I continued to play the piano. I studied music at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, because I could not think of anything else I wanted to do. I got a degree in Music Theory and Composition and I’m a pretty good composer. I even won our senior year composition contest, and I was pretty happy about that. Eventually, I produced 3 solo piano CDs generating good reviews. I wanted to release others, but between my job (I worked at a record company in Universal City), and my social life, I just never got around to making any more.


Currently . . .
Fast forward to now – I’m playing the guitar.   

I am a musician with a new and different vision for myself! My vision is to record 12 to 15 of the songs I have written over the past 2 or more years. The difference is these are singer/songwriter tunes written for guitar with vocals – me! This will be the first time that I will release an album with me as a singer. I am both exhilarated and apprehensive, but mostly living on trust and faith that my dream will come true. 

Recently, I've written over 25 songs for guitar and voice – 12 are completely the way I like them and I am working on three more to include in my album entitled, Everyone Is the Light! These songs are inspirational and heart opening. 
Singing and playing the guitar has been fun, rewarding, and just really cool! And I'd like to share these songs with everyone. But right now it’s a challenge for me to record them. And that’s because to do a great and professional job and to produce a quality album will take some time and lots of expense. 
With my three solo piano CDs, I did a lot of the upfront work in my home studio, which was fine. This time, however, I want a higher quality sound which leads  to greater listening pleasure for you, the audience. And I cannot do it on my own. This can best be achieved by inviting other professional musicians such as a drummer, bassist, and maybe another guitarist to accompany me in the studio. 

$25,000 will help with the following expenses:

Studio Time
Musician Fees
Record Mastering
Website Development & Social Media Management
Download Site Fees & Administration 
Launch Events
Performance Space
Perk Fulfillment
PR Announcements/Press Releases


Making Herstory  
So, I’ve organized this crowdfunding campaign to generate income to record, mix, and master these singer/songwriter tracks and I’m asking you to help me fund the project. As a thank-you for all contributions $10.00 and more, you will receive a download of my new album, Everyone Is the Light! and other perks listed for various contribution levels. Please add a perk if you'd like one – I will gladly send it to you! 

I’m going for the gusto!
I’m really excited about this and at the same time a bit nervous. But I know it will all turn out great – with your help and support, I will succeed. Won’t you please share your light with me and help me get my new album recorded? Please say YES!
Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart!

<p>I was born on June 7th, 1985, in Mianyang, Sichuan, China, rebellious as a school kid, I had a lot of trouble in school, my passion at the time is all about arcade games like Street Fighter, Anime and Nintendo in my home, I was suppressed and felt bored about those courses in school and I had involved in tons of interesting and rebellious things such as climbing out of school walls (in China we had walls in primary school) to play games or fight with other lousy children and I started a big movement in my school involving a teaching-reform as a lot of students couldn’t take the rote learning system so well but failed in doing so due to various reasons based on reality, I learned the importance of self-expression in a traditional Chinese culture environment and I began to probe my philosophical existence, I began to read and listen to human wisdoms and to love music of a various forms at this stage.<br/></p>
<p><b>Hip Hop is the new window for me</b> at my last
few years in primary school and junior middle school; I began to listen to a
lot of great rappers and groups like N.W.A, 2 Pac, Biggie, Puff Daddy and Snoop
Dogg, The liberating side and self-expression side of the music began to facilitate
my self-thinking and self-discovering process, I learnt the B-boy dance when I
reached 19 and I began to immerse into the Hip Hop culture and I began to do
some experiments with my voice and try recording them on the tape.</p>
<p>I always position myself to be a straight guy
and I always have a straight relationship with females, however, I pursue the female
beauty to the extent that I want to try it on me to combine some unique style,
I want to appeal to my fans and let the world understand that there is no
difference whether you wear a skirt or jeans if you are a guy, nor if you wear
male suits and ties if you are a girl, <b>I don’t give a F! Self-expression is
important in your life and definitely crucial in fashion,</b> so I declare that
there shall be no boundaries between your gander and sexuality, I am no gay buh
I don’t give a D who you are, you just be yourself! Be Proud! The dressing
style should never be limited to the reality based on your gender. </p>
<p>So far, I have been devoting myself to my
music production and music career, and I dedicate myself to the constant improvement
of my music and my presence, my major fans include straight as well as LGBT
community, It’s just what you hear and what you understand, It’s just not what
I made, so I am working to make the world a better place, to make you guys more
confident about who you are and what you are into!  </p><p><b>So I ask you to join the movement and share our energy and dreams with this great opportunity!</b></p>

</div></div>","Hi there Sup!

I am Dope Lee the rapper; I need you to help me make the music video of my new single “Masturbate” come into reality!!!:)
Check my single “Masturbate” here:
Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/dopeleereal/masturbateCheck my full interview of the crowdfunding project:Vimeo Version of the interview: https://vimeo.com/143088583

I am a rapper and I am a straight man with an open
     attitude of true self-expression (wearing some type of ""outlandish
     hustle"" clothes and more importantly, just be yourself!).
I love Rap & Hip Hop and I have connections to
     great friends in Hip Hop community internationally.
I have released my 2 mixtapes through Datpiff.com
     and my new single “Masturbate” had been produced and engineered by an
     excellent Atlanta Studio.
I like all ""dope"" things, cool things and
     inspiring things!!!
My friends call me “Dope Is Every Tin” , I call
     myself “Dope Of Da Dough”


I was born on June 7th, 1985, in Mianyang, Sichuan, China, rebellious as a school kid, I had a lot of trouble in school, my passion at the time is all about arcade games like Street Fighter, Anime and Nintendo in my home, I was suppressed and felt bored about those courses in school and I had involved in tons of interesting and rebellious things such as climbing out of school walls (in China we had walls in primary school) to play games or fight with other lousy children and I started a big movement in my school involving a teaching-reform as a lot of students couldn’t take the rote learning system so well but failed in doing so due to various reasons based on reality, I learned the importance of self-expression in a traditional Chinese culture environment and I began to probe my philosophical existence, I began to read and listen to human wisdoms and to love music of a various forms at this stage.
Hip Hop is the new window for me at my last
few years in primary school and junior middle school; I began to listen to a
lot of great rappers and groups like N.W.A, 2 Pac, Biggie, Puff Daddy and Snoop
Dogg, The liberating side and self-expression side of the music began to facilitate
my self-thinking and self-discovering process, I learnt the B-boy dance when I
reached 19 and I began to immerse into the Hip Hop culture and I began to do
some experiments with my voice and try recording them on the tape.
I always position myself to be a straight guy
and I always have a straight relationship with females, however, I pursue the female
beauty to the extent that I want to try it on me to combine some unique style,
I want to appeal to my fans and let the world understand that there is no
difference whether you wear a skirt or jeans if you are a guy, nor if you wear
male suits and ties if you are a girl, I don’t give a F! Self-expression is
important in your life and definitely crucial in fashion, so I declare that
there shall be no boundaries between your gander and sexuality, I am no gay buh
I don’t give a D who you are, you just be yourself! Be Proud! The dressing
style should never be limited to the reality based on your gender. 
So far, I have been devoting myself to my
music production and music career, and I dedicate myself to the constant improvement
of my music and my presence, my major fans include straight as well as LGBT
community, It’s just what you hear and what you understand, It’s just not what
I made, so I am working to make the world a better place, to make you guys more
confident about who you are and what you are into!  So I ask you to join the movement and share our energy and dreams with this great opportunity!

<p>I am a self-taught drummer raised in Texas and the Bay Area of
California.</p>
<p>In high school I found myself playing with Suicidal Tendencies
guitarist Dean Pleasants. I always loved music, and the drive to be a better
musician, as well as a deep seated belief in myself, pushed me far from home,
to the distant lands of Hungary, the coast of Greece and eventually the United
Kingdom. In Europe I was reborn, as a professional musician, and found my home,
onstage performing.  There, thousands of
miles from America, I came into my own playing drums and performing alongside Harold Brown of Famed Band WAR!</p>
<p>It took me a few years before I came back to the states, as a
musician now fully seasoned and ready to take give it my all.  I made the
transition from the drums to playing the bass performing alongside
Alternative recording artist Trae for Cabana Boy Records. I always loved the
energy of bassists Bootsy Collins, Larry Graham and Marcus Miller, and dreamed
of the day I could play the bass onstage before a sold out stadium crowd. </p>
<p>I was bassist for the darkly intoxicating 1960’s influenced
Dreams4sale project alongside front man/songwriter/producer  Dimi Sloane.
A sonic tour de force, we performed in Los Angeles stages our haunting psychedelic
blend of Rock and Funk thrilling packed houses at The Viper Lounge, The El Rey,
The House of Blues and a performance at The Black Coalition Concert.  </p>

<p>Now its time for me to turn the page on a new chapter with my
latest collection of songs, recorded at Demiurge Sound in Los Angeles. The
cutting edge tracks range from 70’s British Rock influenced haunting ballads to
inspirational choral harmonies.  </p>
<p><b>The Details</b></p>
<p>My EP is entitled Confess. It is the culmination of the past ten
years of my life, a blend of Rock, Alternative, and Funk. It is passionate and

years of my life, a blend of Rock, Alternative, and Funk. It is passionate and
painful, my soul laid out, set to music.  My goal is to raise enough financial support to allow me to complete  my debut Ep and support it live .  If you share this experience with me, and Pre-Order the
album, you will get to be on the journey with me and you will hear the songs
before anyone else. The funds donated will help pay the costs of studio time, paying
musicians, mixing, staging, promotion, and other costs for this EP and the
subsequent tour.How your funds are usedStudio and productionMusiciansMix and masteringGraphic design and logoRehearsal space Cd productionMarketing Campaign
