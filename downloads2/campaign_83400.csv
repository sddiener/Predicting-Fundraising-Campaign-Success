</div><div> <ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Tour</h3>
<p>Hey guys! This is Jimmy...I wanted to let you know about the specifics of the 'Melodies of the Aftermath' (MOTA) Tour! This summer, I will be hitting the road, beginning in late-May of this year, traveling to 10 states and 16 cities all throughout the eastern half of the Unites States. The tour begins May 25 in Oklahoma City, then I will travel back down through several cities in Texas (Dallas, Austin, Corpus Christi). In June, I’ll be off to Nashville, Tennessee, followed by Indianapolis, Indiana; Chicago, Illinois; Madison Heights, Michigan; Cleveland and Lakewood, Ohio; Pittsburg and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Washington, D.C. and finally, New York (New York City and Seacliff). </p>
<p>The last time I hit the road for a national tour was 9 years ago (2006) with fellow songwriters David Martinez (Corpus Christi, TX) and Hope Cassity (Nashville, TN). The tour was highly successful, leading to several contacts and opportunities for me for the next few years, including signing a licensing contract with MTV to use my songs in the soundtracks of several of their television shows. <br/></p>
<p>This time, I plan to include a major radio and in-store promotional tour in the midst of the show dates, to further promote the tour, the music, and my brand. And I hope you guys support the journey! :)</p>

<div>The Fair Trade Chamber Music Society was founded in 2015 by musicians dedicated to performing a broad range of chamber music for diverse audiences and in non-traditional settings.  Inspired by the Fair Trade social movement, we believe that by fairly compensating musicians for their artistic endeavors, we will increase the value of the music being performed and therefore help secure a place for classical music in today’s society and increase its sustainability.<span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span>

</div></div>","Who we are:
Warriors of the underground! We are Cobra, a five-pieced heavy metal band based in Lima, Peru.
With almost ten years of existence, a couple of demo tapes, two full lenght albums ""Lethal Stike"" and ""To Hell"", touring around Peru, Chile, Bolivia, Ecuador and Colombia, sharing stage with glorious acts such as Overkill, Whiplash, Sabbat, Satan, Bulldozer, Artillery and Onslaught; now we have the opportunity to take a big step in our carreer and hit Europe.
In February of last year, we received the invitation to one of the most important metal festivals in the world: Keep It True Festival. We are the first band from Latin America to perform at this show.
After this notice, we started to get mails from different countries with gig offers around Europe, so we decided to take this chance and organize what it's going to be our first European tour. This is the third time in history that a metal act from Peru tours around Eruope.
As an independent band, we don't have a big sponsorship that covers all the costs of a tour, so we are the ones that are running with all the expenses: plane tickets, van rental, gas, tolls, etc.
We've received the support from our German label Ván Records, from the booking agency Swamp Booking and from the promoters of the shows in order to have the propper documentation to get the Schengen visa. Now we need the support from the heavy metal maniacs around the world to reach this goal.
Every donation in this campaign is very important for us because it will help us to cover the costs that a propper tour implicates.


About Rough Riding Europe Tour 2015:



One month on the road between Germany, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland, Spain and France.


Shows in Keep It True Festival, Raging Death Date Festival, Metalmería Fest and more die-hard venues.


Sharing stage with great acts such as Exciter, Riot, Death Strike, The Mentors, Possession, Triumphant, Diabolic Night, Attic, Uli Jon Roth, Nocturnal and more.




   
Where your colaboration goes to:
We need to collect at least €2,000 to cover the following costs:
 Van rental
Driver and tour manager daily fee
Gasoline
Tolls 
Beside those, we also are running with the flying ticket expenses by our own, so any extra support from you will be greately appreciated.
Rewards for your support:
Each person who backs this campaign will receive a reward according to the amount of money they donate. We want you to be part of this experience and we want you to know it.

The impact:
Having a well-done tour is an open gate for more Peruvian metal bands to have the chance to tour across Europe and develop a strong international music scene.


    Each action is meaningful:
We know better than anyone that not everyone can be a backer in this kind of projects. If this is your case, we will be very grateful if you can help us in a useful way: spread the word around and generate buzz between your friends, contacts and people who might be intersted.

<strong> </strong><h3>My Story</h3>I have been singing since I was little, and have been pursuing it for the last 13 years. I love so many genres of music, but I primarily sing country and classic rock during live performances. I guess I can blame that on the love of music I got from my Dad.  I have previously recorded two full length country albums which were self funded with the help of family, and a couple of close friends. I have been writing quite a bit of new music in the past couple of years, and I'm itching to get some of it out to the public. I have been asked many times when I will have something new to share, and now that time is coming very soon!  I am going to record a few new songs, and make an EP to try and reach out to the music industry, and build a new team so I can reach my musical goals. These few songs will be part of a full album in the near future.</div><div>Since I'm not good at talking about myself...only in songs, here's some beautiful words from one of my best friends and fellow artist Amber Haydey:</div><div>""I had the pleasure of meeting Erin Haley 8+ years ago, at a show that Global Country was hosting at the Winspear. I was competing in the Global Country Star Search, and Erin was set to perform that night alongside many other talented artists. What started out as friendly conversation, turned into a life long friendship with one of my peers. <br/>Erin is not only an incredible person, she is business savvy, intelligent, and a compelling singer/songwriter. The things she has taught me are invaluable. <br/>Erin has helped me to grow as an artist, and has supported my journey no matter the obstacles.<br/>When it comes to Erin Haley, there is no shortage of talent. <br/>I whole heartedly believe that with her beauty (inside and out), charm, and unique sound, she has every thing it takes to succeed. <br/>I support Erin and her music 100%! I would encourage everyone I know to do the same.<br/>Erin has poured her heart and soul into her music, and I would love nothing more than to see her every dream become reality. There is no one more deserving than Erin Haley.  Help my musical soul sister out!"" <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>Each song costs approximately $2,500 to record. I am planning on 3 or 4 songs at the moment, but if I raise enough money to accomplish more than that, I will most certainly do so! Every single penny raised will go directly to my music. If I'm lucky enough to raise more than I require right now, it will be saved to do the rest of the album and possibly complete a new website, as I only have a splash page at the moment. </div><div>I don't have a lot to offer in return, as I do not have much for merch at the moment, but I would like to get my music out to anyone who supports me so I will be sending my previous albums out to those who donate certain amounts. I know it will cost you more to get a cd this way, but I want to be able to cover the shipping costs, or half of the money you are wanting me to put towards new music will go towards shipping alone. (I should also let everyone know that I am charged a % on funds that I earn...4% if I reach my goal and 9% if I don't, hence the higher price of the cd's).  I will also be listing higher contributors on my splash page, and eventually on a new website, as well as on the album itself. I am also offering receipts for those who have companies and can write this off as advertising on my website and/or album.</div><div>As a side note, if you are a friend or family member who already has all or some of my music and do not wish to receive another cd or want one and not the other, please let me know.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>I will be so grateful to anyone who takes the plunge to help me at all! Every single dollar helps, and is more than appreciated. I don't want to give up on my dream of music, but as all artists know it is a very expensive process  to record, and to do so with the standards I have set for myself. I only want to release high quality music, and with your help I can!</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges  </h3>
<p>There are always challenges in the music industry, like hiring the wrong team to help get the music out to people, or picking the wrong songs. I feel I have learned in my many years to pick songs that people can relate to, and that maybe even those who don't necessarily love country music will like. I have also been around long enough that I can admit I have made mistakes just like everyone else, but have absolutely learned from them. The only main risk with raising money for this project is that if I don't raise enough, I will be further into music debt. There won't be many challenges in the studio because I have an amazing producer to work with, and we will create some cool new music that we will both be proud to put our names on.</p>
</div> <div> </div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><div> </div><p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p><div> </div><p>I understand that not everyone can afford to help me with this project. I feel the effects of the oil industry as well, so I know even $20 may be hard for some. If you can't afford to put any money into this crazy dream of mine but you still want to give me a hand, please pass this on to friends and family who you think might enjoy my music. I want to thank each and every one of you in advance for ANY support you show me! Don't be surprised if you get a thank-you message...</p></div>","My StoryI have been singing since I was little, and have been pursuing it for the last 13 years.

of musicians like Tiersen, Einaudi, Glass, Nyman, and others, especially
 the orchestrated ones, reminds Ennio Morricone.FANTASIA - ITUNESTHE SECOND ALBUM - THE CHANCE YOU NEVER HADIn 2014 I have released my second album ""The Chance You Never Had""  which was a more public success in some digital store like Amazon or Itunes, including Spotify!THE CHANCE YOU NEVER HAD - PHYSICAL CD BY AMAZONSPOTIFY_THOMAS CADENAZZIThe Chance You Never Had is a more epic album, well designed for epic movies or trailers; it has been recordered in a small studio with some real instruments played live. Here are some of my compositions you can also find online, in my Youtube Channel.THE NEXT ALBUM - CRYSTALLIZEDWith the next album, I want to reach the perfection in my sound, and for this reason I need some funds to improving my studio's strumentations.The money, infact, will be used for the cost of the studio time, for all the strumentation required, paying for the orchestrations and the musicians, for the mixing and mastering process and then for the production costs, the promotion and graphic design!Thank you in advance for any help you can provide, for check out my indiegogo page, and for the support I receive!Best,ThomasFollow THOMAS:

<p>
</p><p>This
project is all about music. With, what will be, my seventh album
under my own name, I am setting out to create a whole new recording
of original music written and arranged for 11 brass and 5 rhythm.
Essentially, it’s a big band without the saxophone section. The

<p>
</p><p>With
the “Off the Road” album, which many of you very generously
supported, I wanted to meet my own challenge of making a recording on
which I perform most of the instruments. As a result, with the help
of a few wonderful guests, I was able to record “Off the Road” by
playing trumpet (my first instrument), french horn, trombone,
acoustic and electric bass, piano, and some percussion. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This

to be performed live by my new Toronto-based ensemble, <b>Mike

<p>
</p><p>I
would guess that it's safe to say that it is a selfish desire for
most composers to hear their own music exactly as they intended it to
be performed. For that reason, I have chosen to, once again, perform
the majority of instruments here with the help of my good friend
Richard Moore on drums. However, my main reason for recording this
way is because I have so much fun in the challenge of it. Often, I
will write something and then wonder if it's playable on the given
instrument. After cursing myself a few times and then accomplishing
the goal, I know that it is possible to be played by another who is
more proficient than me. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However,
as I said originally, this album is about music and not the antics
that go into recording. It is my hope that the recording that results
from your contribution will produce music that brings smiles to the

</div></div>","THE BUDGET: where your money will goTo present musicians of such high artistic attainment in public concerts, ticket sales are not sufficient to cover costs. This festival can be sustained only with the help of enthusiastic and generous supporters. A festival of such high artistic quality requires a considerable sum of money to finance the artists, the venue and the publicity campaign. Help us become a permanent fixture of the Bay Area musical scene. We have 30 days to raise $5000.Our goals are:
to present the great masterpieces of French music to the San Francisco Bay Area public
to present performances of exceptional quality by the finest musicians and singers in the San Francisco Bay Area
to continue presenting this festival as an annual highlight of musical life in the San Francisco/San Jose Bay Area 
Our hope is to attract a loyal following of music enthusiasts to back this project. Lovers of French Classical Music, unite!!! Both big and small, your contributions will help create a stable financial environment for this festival.ALL CONTRIBUTIONS ARE TAX-DEDUCTIBLE - THE ALLIANCE FRANCAISE OF SILICON VALLEY IS A CALIFORNIA 501 (C) 3-NOT FOR-PROFIT ASSOCIATION ESTABLISHED SINCE 1970
THE STORYTwo years ago, conductor Mark Starr and French flutist Isabelle Chapuis - filled
with a love for French classical music - asked the Alliance Française of Silicon
Valley (AFSCV) to create an annual musical event devoted to French music. In 2014, we inaugurated the festival in Tateuchi Recital Hall in Mountain View. 
Mark Starr, festival co-musical director, says: “It is important to note
that there are no other festivals dedicated to French classical music,
featuring top local musicians, in the San Francisco Bay Area - or even in the
United States. There, lovers of French music can indulge their
passion for masterpieces by French composers, and noted local
musicians and singers can perform for you the great French masterpieces they
love so much. Our festival is an elite showcase. Our aim now is to make this festival a permanent annual event.”                                                               

                                                                       Mark Starr
In the first season, on June 20th, 2014, the festival presented music by Darius Milhaud, Maurice Ravel, Francis
Poulenc, Gabriel Fauré and Edith Piaf, all performed by the brilliant Bay
Area chamber music group Ensemble San
Francisco. 
Ensemble San Francisco performs Gabriel Faure Piano Quartet No. 1

On June 21st 2014, a second program presented a wide variety of
virtuoso works by French composers Charles-Valentin
Alkan, Maurice Ravel, André Jolivet, and Ernest Chausson. Performers included the young violin sensation
Stephen Waarts, brilliant pianist and Ravel expert Gwendolyn Mok, the Festival
Percussion Ensemble, conducted by Mark Starr, French flute soloist Isabelle
Chapuis, celebrated mezzo-soprano Layna Chiankis, the Festival String Quartet, and noted Bay Area pianist Dmitrij Cogan.



Stephen Waarts, violin, and Gwendolyn Mok, piano, are soloists with the
Festival String Quartet, in Ernest Chausson’s Concert pour violon, piano et
Quatuor à cordes.



THEY TALKED ABOUT IT


Richard Scheinin, music Critic of the San Jose Mercury News, called our first season “an appealing startup festival.” 

Michael Strickland, writer/musician wrote on his blog: “Ensemble San Francisco performed A Parisian Evening of music by French composers that was marvelous. (...) The entire event was so enjoyable that I can't wait to see what they do next.""


AN ELITE EVENT FOR EVERYONE (at moderate ticket prices)
The co-musical directors would like to develop this new festival into an annual rendez-vous for French classical music lovers in Northern California. We believe there is a public in the San Francisco Bay Area consisting of lovers of French music and French culture. Moreover, we are committed to featuring musicians and singers from the San Francisco Bay Area. As Mark Starr has noted: “New York does not have a monopoly on first-rate musicians. The Bay Area is filled with extraordinary soloists, superb singers and fresh young talent. And when you ask many of them what music they would like to perform most, the lion’s share often goes to works by French composers.”


2015: TWO CONCERTS IN EIGHT DAYS
The concerts will again take place at the
Tateuchi Recital Hall in the Community School of Music and Arts, 230 San
Antonio Circle, Mountain View.
In this intimate atmosphere, eleven outstanding musicians will perform the
works of seven composers from France and francophone countries: 





1. On June 19: ""Three summits of French
chamber music"" will include the Debussy Sonata for cello and piano, Ravel’s Piano Trio, and Franck’s Piano Quintet. Featured artists from Ensemble
San Francisco:




2. On June 27: ""Jewels of French Music"" will focus on shorter masterpieces,
including Ravel’s Sonata for violin and piano, Poulenc’s Sonata for Two Pianos, Messiaen’s Le merle noir, Varese’s Density 21.5; and Ysaye’s Sonata for Solo
Violin No. 3 (“Ballade”).

<h3>Hey there!</h3>
<p>We are Uncle Dad's Art Collective: a Chico, CA-based, community-focused arts organization whose goal is to support and empower North State artists. This September we will be producing the 4th annual installment of Small Town, Big Sound -- a show where lush, orchestral strings, brass, and winds team up with angelic backup vocalists and a rockin’ rhythm section to shine a light on some of the most exciting music coming out of our region today.</p>
<p><strong>This year is extra special for us. </strong></p>
<p>It's always been a dream of ours to make the North State a little bit smaller by taking our shows on the road and showcasing then in our neighboring towns. This year we are terribly excited to get this amazing show -- featuring all North State performers and crew -- in front of audiences in Chico, Weaverville, Orland, and Redding. The downside to traveling, and the reason we haven't taken shows on the road before, is the intense cost.</p>
<p><strong>The bottom line:</strong> <i>This show is simply way too expensive for us to do on our own.</i></p>
<p>Part of our mission is to pay all of the artists we work with. With 4 performances, a 20-ish piece band, and 15 featured songwriters, costs add up really quickly. By supporting this production with a contribution, you will essentially be putting your money directly into the pocket (or shoe box/bank account/sock drawer) of some of the most talented musicians that our community has to offer.</p>
<p>That's a big deal -- <strong>a really big deal</strong> -- and we hope that you feel as strongly about that as we do.</p>
<p>Plus, for helping out, you get cool things like these snazzy pins! More information on those down at the bottom (and a higher resolution version of the mockup is at <a href=""https://imgur.com/a/dAuuT4u"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://imgur.com/a/dAuuT4u</a>)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530721672/ipshk4rmdoacys2xer8q.png"" src=""""/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Alright, but how much of that $7,600 goal is really going to artists?</h3>
<p>All of it! Well, except for the ~8% that goes to IndieGoGo and payment processing. The real cost of making this show happen for 4 nights is about $13,500. That includes (roughly):</p>
<ul>
<li>$8,300 for the band and songwriters</li>
<li>$1,500 for our arrangers (they're the ones who put the orchestra behind the songwriters)</li>
<li>$1,900 for our music director, a top notch tech crew, and all the gear we need to bring and rent.</li>
<li>$1,800 for other expenses including printing our books, t-shirts, travel, marketing, and graphic design.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, assuming we reach our goal (which we really hope you'll help us do), this campaign will put about $7,000 toward paying our band and songwriters. We weren't kidding -- you're putting money in their pockets (or shoe box/bank...you get it). </p>
</div><div><ul></ul></div><div>
<h3>Okay, I get it, it's expensive. But what happens if you don't raise all that money?</h3>
<p>The world will end. No, really, it will.</p>
<p>Okay, the world won't really end. The reality is that the show will still happen. We will still figure out how to pay everybody involved, because that's the right way to do things, but it will put our organization in a tough spot. Instead of looking to the future to figure out what our next fun, over-the-top, community-serving endeavor will be, we will be spending our time figuring out how to put on events that make money so that we can offset our debt.</p>
<p>That is obviously the risk of pursuing goals that seem just out of reach. But ya know what?<strong> It's worth it even thought it's scary,</strong> and we are hopeful that you and the rest of our community will help support us as we venture into this uncharted territory.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know that not everybody can afford to contribute, but that doesn't mean that you can't help us out in other ways. Anything you can do to share this campaign (maybe with those handy buttons IndieGoGo conveniently placed up top) or the show itself is very helpful and very appreciated. Tweet, gram, pin, bark, growl, talk, or do whatever it is you do to tell your social circles about things you think are worthwhile.</p>
<h3>Thank you!</h3>
<p>Seriously, thank you. Everything that Uncle Dad's Art Collective has ever produced has been made possible by the outpouring of support that we've gotten from the community. Small Town, Big Sound 2018 is just one of many shows to come that could not have happened without you.</p>
<p>So again, thank you so very much!</p>
<h3>So how about those pins?</h3>
<p>Our Small Town, Big Sound 2018<i> ""Singer"" </i>needs some overall cleanup to make it pin-ready, so that'll end up being a bit different -- but not by much! The Uncle Dad's Art Collective <i>""Masks 'n' Saxes""</i> design  is final. Higher-res mockup above at <a href=""https://imgur.com/a/dAuuT4u"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://imgur.com/a/dAuuT4u</a>.</p>
<p>The <i>""Singer"" </i>will probably be 1.25"" to 1.5"" wide, and the <i>""Masks 'n' Saxes""</i> will probably be 1""-1.25"" wide.</p>
<h3>Adopt-a-song Information</h3>
<p>Facilitating this on IndieGoGo would mean creating 14 separate perks, which would really make that list unreadable. In lieu of that, we're maintaining a list of all songs' adoption statuses at: <a href=""https://tinyurl.com/y765nyzn"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://tinyurl.com/y765nyzn</a>. We will do our absolute best to keep this as up to date as possible. When you make your contribution, leave a note regarding the artist/song you'd like to adopt and we will update our list accordingly.</p>
<p>However, please keep in mind that it is a huge pain to refund your contributions once they are submitted. So, if for some reason you choose to adopt a song that has already been picked up because there was a gap in our list updates, we'd really appreciate your willingness to adopt another song instead. If you have any questions/concerns about adoption availability, please contact us prior to contributing.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are Mike and Lisa Jacob, aka Judah's Pride.  We have been doing Christian Hip Hop together now for almost 10 years.  Hip Hop is a powerfully influential culture that is truly shaping the lives of our young people.  We hear youth all the time singing/rapping lyrics to secular songs without fully understand the negative connotations in what they are saying, and sadly sometimes they do understand all too well what they are saying.  Our passion to create Hip Hop music that is not only appealing but that also provides a powerful positive message that encourages wisdom in making life decisions.  This album has been many years in the making and we are so excited to share it with the world.  We believe that the further this album reaches, the more lives that will be impacted.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We currently need $3,500 to complete this project. </p>
<p>This will provide funding for:</p>
<ul>
<li>The replication, packaging, and distribution of this album</li>
<li>Promotion for album sales</li>
<li>and if there is any left over it will go towards the creation of a music video of one of the songs  </li>
</ul>
<p>Donate $10 or more and you will receive a CD from us as soon as we have them.</p>
<p>Donate $200 or more plus cover our travel expenses and we will do a concert at your venue. (Date and Time subject to our availability)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>God put it on Mike's heart years ago that our first album should be a seed offering into discipleship ministry.  Since then, God has put two very powerful ministries on our hearts to support.  100% of the proceeds of sales from this first album will be split 50/50 between these two ministries.  One of the ministries, Heroes Camp, uses basketball as a tool to help shape and mold the lives of so many young people in the South Bend area.  The other is Roma Learning to Fly, which is an organization that uses educational tools to empower the Roma people in Slovakia and several other countries throughout Europe. </p>
<p>Supporting this campaign will not just help get our music out there, it will also be supporting these two very influential ministries.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>At this time, the only thing delaying the album release is funding. Everything else is set and ready to go. Once we have reached our funding goal, we will be able to send off for the replication, packaging and distribution of the CD.  This process should take only a few weeks.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some of you may not be able to contribute financially, but that doesn't mean you can't help.  Here are some other needs we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>A graphic designer to design our album cover and logo (time sensitive).</li>
<li>Help with marketing the album to radio stations and other places.</li>
<li>People to share our campaign on social media.</li>
<li>People to help get us booked at different venues and services.</li>

Greg is a Jazz Vocalist from Atlanta, Georgia that is passionate about bringing hope and joy to the world and those around him. He does this by sharing and performing elegant and excellent music. He is excited to take a step from the stage to the studio to record his first-ever full length album as a way to share his music and his joy in music on a wider level. 

Greg is an independent artist, well connected in the Jazz circuits of Atlanta. 
He is teaming up with Delbert Felix (Bass), Kevin Bales (Piano),  Justin Varnes (Drums), Melvin Jones (Trumpet), and John Sandfort (Tenor) to perform a blend of hiply arranged and lesser known Jazz Standards, original compositions, and Jazz arrangements of Alternative Rock tunes.
He has co-written a tune with Delbert Felix (Arranged by composer/pianist Tyrone Jackson), which will be recorded with acclaimed Hip Hop Artist/Social Activist Sho Baraka.
Greg will be recording his debut album in Atlanta, at The Studio with the renowned Engineer and Jazz Drummer, Marlon Patton.
Justin Varnes, along with Greg, will produce the album.
The album will be recorded in December 2017, and released in March 2018.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! If you watched the videos on this page then you already know a little about me and what is going on. </p>
<p>My name is Brock Davisson and I'm a musician/guitarist since 1992. I have dwarfism and clubfoot and get around with the help of a wheelchair/walker. When a guitar was presented to me and my brother in 1992 by my parents at a early age, I realized right away that I couldn't play like everyone else due to limited mobility in my wrists/joints from dwarfism so I did what came natural and just put my hand over the top of the fretboard and off I went and here I am today where music is my entire life and I'm still loving it!</p>
<p>I'm writing to say thanks to all the familiar people that know who I am today for showing support the past few years and helping us get out the 2015 album ""Outtakes From The Soul"" which has had great success online worldwide and made it #15 on the billboard blues chart May, 21st 2016, and for all the love on my youtube and facebook videos and posts and more. None of it would have happened without you and we greatly appreciate you believing in us and letting our passion for music come out to make you happy as well. For those who don't know me, please look me up on youtube and facebook and watch the many videos that are available and share them if you like them, leave me comments if you enjoy them, and friend request or follow me!</p>
<p>We now sit here in 2018 with a huge smile, and we want to let you know it's time for the 2nd album to become a reality! For awhile now we have had many people wanting to know when another album was going to come out and here we are! The plan is to showcase maturity and diversity and in the end create something that showcases mine and our skills and make a fuller production, experiment with tones and sounds a little more compared to the last album and much more. Just like the last album we will need your help to turn our passion and love into music and to get it out there to the world again. We did so great last time and we're hoping we can do great again because remember it's only possible with the help of you! The help that we recieve from you believing in us will determine how much we can do this time around. We have plans to make more CD's this time, and possibly reissue ""outtakes from the soul"" on CD as well since many has asked for a CD copy of it again and possibly more professional video content and more! I hope you consider giving something and enjoying this ride with us. Thanks!</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I will need at least $5000 to get the album started and finished. This also includes the price to order 500 CDs. I will be using Skylight Media again for the production (recording, mixing and mastering). Andy, Courtney and Josh of Skylight Media will be helping me write as well as playing some of the other instruments on the album. We may have a few other musicians as well. Some familiar faces, like Daniel and Todd, and my friend Dustin.</p>
<p>We have some awesome perks for donors! We will have signed physical CDs, album downloads, signed 10 inch mini guitars, shout-outs, and even a real USA custom built Roberts telecaster made in GA, USA and it will be signed by me too!</p>
<p>::::: DISCLAIMER ::::: There is no time limit set on perks because life happens. Most likely everything should be done by early spring 2019 and out by summer 2019 or earlier if all goes as planned. We will get them out as promised as soon as we can when the new album is recorded, mixed and mastered and we get them back etc. If you follow me on social media sites, you'll be updated there as well as here with progress and any changes.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There isn't much risk really. I worked with the same studio on my last album 4 years ago. We learned a lot and have worked out most of the kinks in that process. All of the money is going to go into this project. if we go over $5000 we will use the extra to maybe order the album on vinyl or order more than 500 CDs. We can order the 1st album again and have those available once more for those who still want it on CD. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute we ask you to please share this campaign with others all over your social media accounts so that we can reach as many as possible.</p>

What We Need & What You Get
I will need at least $5000 to get the album started and finished. This also includes the price to order 500 CDs. I will be using Skylight Media again for the production (recording, mixing and mastering). Andy, Courtney and Josh of Skylight Media will be helping me write as well as playing some of the other instruments on the album. We may have a few other musicians as well. Some familiar faces, like Daniel and Todd, and my friend Dustin.
We have some awesome perks for donors! We will have signed physical CDs, album downloads, signed 10 inch mini guitars, shout-outs, and even a real USA custom built Roberts telecaster made in GA, USA and it will be signed by me too!
::::: DISCLAIMER ::::: There is no time limit set on perks because life happens. Most likely everything should be done by early spring 2019 and out by summer 2019 or earlier if all goes as planned. We will get them out as promised as soon as we can when the new album is recorded, mixed and mastered and we get them back etc. If you follow me on social media sites, you'll be updated there as well as here with progress and any changes.

Risks & Challenges
There isn't much risk really. I worked with the same studio on my last album 4 years ago. We learned a lot and have worked out most of the kinks in that process. All of the money is going to go into this project. if we go over $5000 we will use the extra to maybe order the album on vinyl or order more than 500 CDs. We can order the 1st album again and have those available once more for those who still want it on CD.

Unfortunately, when all was said and done we lost a significant amount of money producing the event last year, and being a completely grassroots event created by artists, we did not ever have backend investors backing the project.

<h3><strong>Short Summary</strong></h3>
<p>When I was young I always knew I wanted to be a singer, but I also knew I would need a stable job to provide a regular income too. </p>
<p><strong>What if</strong>, when you are young and begin to realise your dream and passion is music, you can work 100% towards just that? Knowing there is a career available. Rather than splitting your enthusiasm, splitting your focus and splitting your energy (No, it's not just a hobby nan!) </p>
<p>This is the core reason we are building The Unsigned Library, to help fellow independent musicians and future generations to learn about the music industry from day 1 and know they can earn what they deserve for their musical talent and start to build a career in music licensing.</p>
<p>After many years as a singer, skating around the periphery of the music industry, I was lucky enough to work with some great Producers, write some great songs, learn about and most importantly fall totally and utterly in love with music placement - those songs on adverts that you just can't get out of your head or those songs on tear-jerking ITV dramas that have you feeling emotional for days! That's music licensing! Selling licenses for your incredible music to be used on advertisements, tv, films, radio &amp; gaming. An industry that is thriving, however so many independent musicians don't know about it, don't know how to get started or they think they'll lose control of their music due to not understanding the intense legal language on licenses (let's be honest who can afford a lawyer to check things over before you sign on the dotted line?)</p>
<p>We have been working on this project and brand identity for almost 2 years, to ensure it is focusing on the right direction, filling the gaps of the current, similar offerings and now we are ready to ask all you lovely people (musicians, bands, music lovers, independent music supporters, advertising agencies, music production companies, anyone really) to support us and make it a reality.</p>
<p><strong>Built for musicians by musicians -  what a beautiful story!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Talking of stories, here's Leila's.</strong></p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/262652524?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>* Let's increase the amount of independent music used on ad campaigns, TV &amp; film. * Let's create a potential launch platform for budding artists * Let's connect brands and artists together and watch them grow.​</p>
<p>I have been working within the Marketing industry for almost 10 years now, alongside this as a singer, songwriter. I have had the pleasure of meeting and working with many creative and strategic brains, music publishing companies, music licensing companies and talented musical masters.</p>
<p>Agencies and Producers often seek independent musicians to create a sound-a-like song for their campaign, or music on advertising, which is great for keeping the cost lower for the client but would still be a fair payment for independent musicians. On top of this it's great that agencies are more focused on the campaign as a whole. Fiona Gaiger (strategic planning consultant for Brand &amp; Agency) says in her testimonial for The Unsigned Library, ""in keeping with the spirit of responsible business, the fair pricing policy and percentage return to the musician demonstrates a belief in rewarding raw talent fairly."" PERFECT! </p>
<p>When I was asked by Glenn Keiles (award winning music composer and producer) to write a song overnight for a brief he was asked to compose for, I was instantly hooked and immediately wanted to find a way to help other musicians feel that rush. Writing a song to brief overnight, recording it the next day and knowing people would hear it on tv - what a buzz! This is when the brainstorming began...This was the opportunity of becoming a working musician without touring for months away from family and friends, I could still have a family and also follow my dreams in music and earn from music royalties.</p>
<p>Being surrounded by so much incredible undiscovered talent and seeing the work available for them is what drove the focus to the advertising industry. We will seek songs with that extra something, great songs that connect with you emotionally. We've seen the 'emotional connection with the audience' becoming a more important goal for brands; Sainsburys, Marks and Spencer, John Lewis, and most recently Amazon and the high street banks are just some of the brands that have joined in on this advertising genius. Whether it's in the melody, lyrically or instrumentally, if a song grabs you emotionally it can result in significantly increased sales for the brand using it.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>We are fundraising to build the website that will change our (independent musicians) lives and our music careers as we know it.</p>
<p><strong>THE WEBSITE</strong> - it's a super duper one! with intense backend coding to ensure we can tag our music in as many ways as possible, we can upload, download, search, sell, discuss briefs with the client, make revisions to music, access a jobs board where the client can post jobs for musicians to pitch on, all at the same time! so that is why it will cost the grand sum of £30,000 but this is the entire ship! the rest of the funding will be for marketing and PR to launch the platform to both musicians and advertising agencies, music supervisors, production houses, etc (everyone that needs music for their content will hear about us, let's just say we've touched base with London Flashmob!) leaving £25,000 for marketing, PR and initial website running costs - Let's let the world know we are here!</p>
<p>Here's a marketing plan we had drawn up to show you that we are on top of things - you'll see potential marketing opportunities for when we launch The Unsigned Library.</p>
<div><a href=""https://vimeo.com/253283402"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/253283402?portrait=0""></iframe></div></a></div>
<p>Now take a look at how the website could look, bearing in mind we're no web designers! (we'll leave that to the professionals!) this is just a mock up so you can get a feel for the platform, super cool, easy to navigate and will be the host for some (hopefully all one day!) of the most current, relevant independent music available.</p>
<div><a href=""https://vimeo.com/251676266"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/251676266?portrait=0""></iframe></div></a></div>
<p>Yes we have high hopes and so much passion for this project! in the 5 year plan there's music venues, musicology research, innovative algorithms for a deeper search-ability, forefront of discovering musical trends – industry partnerships, studio &amp; musician GPS. The ideas for the growth of this brand are big!</p>
<p><strong>THE BRAND</strong> - Cool, Current, Creative, Emerging, Exciting, Evolving...</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522358205/ei0kqpg2iidfq9v4lb0i.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We've always had the brand identity as a core focus, as we know how important it is to help aid the success of a new business and continuous growth in a competitive market. The Unsigned Library fits like a glove into the trendy unsigned music community and its relative companies i.e. BBC Introducing, Glastonbury unsigned stage, The Unsigned Guide and Unsigned Music Awards. Alongside being a marketing dream, this will instantly put us within the right space to attract the right artists and clients and become an integral part of the unsigned industry which is growing in size due to artists choosing to remain unsigned and in control of their music.</p>
<p><strong>COMPANY POSITION &amp; THE TEAM</strong> - The Unsigned Library is a Limited company and holds a trademark in the UK under 5 classes, which cover the key areas for business operations and for the potential areas of growth. Trademarks for the rest of Europe and US are next. I have personally invested £7,500 in the company on legal, trademarks, design, brand &amp; social media support. I will also personally invest whatever I can, hiring interns &amp; musicians until the company is generating an income. </p>
<p>We have one of the most passionate teams, with personal drive and vision for the company, We are working &amp; talking with; web developers, marketing consultant advisors, digital marketing consultant, accountant, musicians working on A&amp;R, music producers, song writers, multi instrumentalists, singers and a potential A&amp;R collaboration with a fabulous new music start up, who also make it their life mission to expose independent music.</p>
<p><strong>We've made you a little video to give you a little more insight into licensing, how it works and why you should get involved.</strong></p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/262460225?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div> </div>
<p><strong>THE VISION</strong> - So with a successfully funded campaign, we will create a platform to recognise and magnify the quality of independent music. Actively promoting and pitching the library to advertising agencies &amp; music production houses. With years of working around creative campaigns, we know the potential of work that is out there for us. Linking a brand with emerging talent can have invaluable and long term results for both and that is why a core focus is the advertising industry. Let's fill the library full of great tracks and let them speak for themselves......preferably on national tv!</p>
<p><strong>THE PERKS</strong> - Ok so we've done some thinking on this and after lots of research into what people want, we have decided to keep it personal, we want you to feel like a part of this family and be on this journey with us, so everyone that pledges will become a 'Founding Member' of The Unsigned Library and be recorded on our 'wall of love' on the website forever! We have a few different perks that will express our gratitude for supporting independent music; from unlimited use of the platform for musicians to VIP invitations to join us at our AGM (which will of course be an epic launch party not a boring meeting) we know support like this is because you're interested in the company idea or a musician yourself and we want you around to watch the brand grow. </p>
<p><i>NB: As some of the perks are dependent on the platform being built, we will add your pledges to a pot that we will continue to add to, holding events and thinking of other fabulous money making ideas!</i></p>
<p><strong>CHARITY</strong> - We are delighted to say that we will be collaborating with a charity close to our hearts, but until the finer details are confirmed we can't officially announce it, but we're chuffed to bits to support them and you will be too.</p>
<p><i>What will you do if you don't reach your funding goal?</i></p>
<p><strong>THE BACK UP PLAN</strong> - Although when you break down the funding goal to 2200 people kindly pledging £25+ each, it doesn't sound so scary!....should we not reach the target amount, we plan to break the journey down into smaller stages, should we raise enough for the website alone, that's amazing, we can begin to populate the library with music and with a fully functioning platform we can promote it to advertising agencies and music supervisors and start raising awareness prior to any marketing launch. Also we can set up a second round of fundraising for the marketing budget, by this time we will have the website to show potential supporters.</p>
<p><i>Be transparent and tell your potential supporters of any risks &amp; challenges.</i></p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>We have identified 2 at this time:</p>
<p>Ensuring the volume of music and composers is available on the library prior to launching to the advertising agencies and music production companies (and communicating our position should we meet them at an earlier stage) We are aware that there are various avenues to source music, however we also know that the music seeker will hunt high and low, always using every avenue available to find that 'perfect piece'.</p>
<p>We will make a huge impact and standout by having quality music, great songs, killer tracks, a library full of emerging talent to work to brief, so should you not find the perfect song for your campaign they can create it for you. This is how we will be used again and again and become known for the place to find all (eventually!) incredible emerging talent.</p>
<p>The other area of challenge will be to clearly and effectively communicate our '100% pro-musician' values to independent musicians. Ensuring it is understood that we are musicians building this platform for musicians, no catches, no sneaky small print!</p>
<p>We're all running in the same music circles, the trust has been easier to build and the platform is being built for us as well as them. Win win! </p>
<p>There will always be obstacles to slow us down, but we don't mind reducing the speed if it means clarifying our message, ensuring we are on the right path and staying true to the values of The Unsigned Library. An organically grown company driven by passion and talent.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>I hope we have tantalised you enough to pledge your support to this great project, but if you would like to support us in other ways to help us achieve our funding goal, PLEEEASE DO!</p>
<p>We appreciate all the help you can offer, whether it's shouting from the rooftops on your social media platforms, or on actual rooftops (for professionals only - do not try this at home!) There are tools for sharing so please go right ahead and use them!</p>
<p>Supporting The Unsigned Library is supporting the independent music community. Help us help them earn what they deserve and build a financially rewarding career in music.</p>
<p>We will always try to improve everything we do and if you haven't pledged on our project we would love to know why? Please send us your feedback so we can learn and adapt. <a href=""mailto:unsignedlibrary@musician.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>unsignedlibrary@musician.org </strong></a></p>

This is how we will be used again and again and become known for the place to find all (eventually!) incredible emerging talent.
The other area of challenge will be to clearly and effectively communicate our '100% pro-musician' values to independent musicians. Ensuring it is understood that we are musicians building this platform for musicians, no catches, no sneaky small print!
We're all running in the same music circles, the trust has been easier to build and the platform is being built for us as well as them. Win win! 
There will always be obstacles to slow us down, but we don't mind reducing the speed if it means clarifying our message, ensuring we are on the right path and staying true to the values of The Unsigned Library. An organically grown company driven by passion and talent.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Rossini Club, in an effort to put the heart back into classical music, hearkens to another age when chamber music was made in almost every home. With its multilayered creative process involving composers, performers, and laymen working together, the Club recreates this process, both with our programming and our concert settings. The Rossini Club is strongly invested in its Nantucket community, providing music for those who cannot access it as easily, such as seniors and young children. It is our mission to spread music to musicians and non-musicians from all walks of life.<br/><br/>Your contribution will not only help us this summer, but for future summers to come. If we meet our goal, we will be able to start a general fund to ensure future Rossini Club seasons. Help us make the Rossini Club a permanent fixture of Nantucket's cultural life!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In short, the expenses of Nantucket do provide a hurdle in terms of our financial burden. Most of our funding therefore is concerned with the practical aspects of bringing our musicians to the island and providing the supplies they need for their time here:</p>
<ul>
<li>$1200 Musician Travel</li>
<li>$1000 On-Island Transportation</li>
<li>$1050 Food Stipends</li>
<li>$750 Administrative Costs</li>
</ul>
<p>If we are unable to complete our funding this year, our funds will still be used towards covering all of our practical costs for this summer. In thanks for your contribution, we are able to offer a number of unique items featuring our work and our musicians:</p>
<ul>
<li>RC Logo T-Shirts</li>
<li>RC Summer 2018 CD's</li>
<li>Complimentary Tickets</li>
<li>Rehearsal attendance</li>
<li>Ambrosia Nantucket Tea</li>
<li>A private concert in YOUR home!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We have been curating events including music and food since 2012, and we wish to see our program expand to a more sustainable and permanent model for the Nantucket summer season. Through our collaborations with Ambrosia Nantucket, the Nantucket Music Center, the Nantucket Historical Association, the Nantucket Atheneum and the Nantucket Culinary Center, we have been fortunate to bring our arts to a wide variety of audiences. This summer we also continue our musical outreach to the retirement communities of Nantucket, and are excited to be debuting our educational program at the Nantucket Boys &amp; Girls Club. We are also excited to be collaborating with the Theatre Workshop of Nantucket on a unique Cabaret Night as an ongoing effort to diversify and blend differing art forms. Our intent is to reinvigorate the classical music community on Nantucket through communication and connection with music.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We know Nantucket is a busy place with so many things going on it's hard to keep track! Our product is unique however in its flexibility. The purpose of these projects and concerts is to make our art form accessible, and in doing so re-identifying classical music as an integral part of our culture. By bringing the concerts to unusual locations and to pair them with unique events, we hope to foster a keen interest not just for our series, but for the arts in general.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't make a donation, come to our concerts this summer on Nantucket island! Spread the word about our fundraising efforts and thank you for your continued support.</p>

If we meet our goal, we will be able to start a general fund to ensure future Rossini Club seasons. Help us make the Rossini Club a permanent fixture of Nantucket's cultural life!

What We Need & What You Get
In short, the expenses of Nantucket do provide a hurdle in terms of our financial burden. Most of our funding therefore is concerned with the practical aspects of bringing our musicians to the island and providing the supplies they need for their time here:

$1200 Musician Travel
$1000 On-Island Transportation
$1050 Food Stipends
$750 Administrative Costs

If we are unable to complete our funding this year, our funds will still be used towards covering all of our practical costs for this summer. In thanks for your contribution, we are able to offer a number of unique items featuring our work and our musicians:

RC Logo T-Shirts
RC Summer 2018 CD's
Complimentary Tickets
Rehearsal attendance
Ambrosia Nantucket Tea
A private concert in YOUR home!


The Impact
We have been curating events including music and food since 2012, and we wish to see our program expand to a more sustainable and permanent model for the Nantucket summer season. Through our collaborations with Ambrosia Nantucket, the Nantucket Music Center, the Nantucket Historical Association, the Nantucket Atheneum and the Nantucket Culinary Center, we have been fortunate to bring our arts to a wide variety of audiences. This summer we also continue our musical outreach to the retirement communities of Nantucket, and are excited to be debuting our educational program at the Nantucket Boys & Girls Club. We are also excited to be collaborating with the Theatre Workshop of Nantucket on a unique Cabaret Night as an ongoing effort to diversify and blend differing art forms. Our intent is to reinvigorate the classical music community on Nantucket through communication and connection with music.

Risks & Challenges
We know Nantucket is a busy place with so many things going on it's hard to keep track! Our product is unique however in its flexibility. The purpose of these projects and concerts is to make our art form accessible, and in doing so re-identifying classical music as an integral part of our culture. By bringing the concerts to unusual locations and to pair them with unique events, we hope to foster a keen interest not just for our series, but for the arts in general.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't make a donation, come to our concerts this summer on Nantucket island! Spread the word about our fundraising efforts and thank you for your continued support.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>A Musical Star that's Ready to Soar</h3>
<p>Elle Renee is sixteen going on superstardom, and she's been working so hard to get there. Over the last two years Elle has been honing her craft as a singer/songwriter and spending long days in the studio to record her music. All while going to school full time, performing in local events, and doing her chores at home (okay, okay, she's still working on making her bed).</p>
<p>Elle is just a few months away from dropping her first ever EP, and she wants to mark this launch by staging a concert where she can meet her fans and perform her songs (did we mention she's also an awesome dancer?). So how about it -- give this talented and hardworking girl that first big boost she needs to break out and become the star she's meant to be.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Help Elle Renee stage her first concert</h3>
<p>Elle Renee needs funding to cover concert venue rental, wages for band members, dancers and stage technicians, event insurance, marketing and all the other elements and moving parts that must come together to produce an engaging, high-quality event.</p>
<p>Elle's first concert will be held in Toronto in late spring / early summer 2018. Contributors who pitch in with at least $25 get a ticket to the event. Bigger donations are rewarded with perks such as in-person meet-and-greet with Elle and Skype or FaceTime chats.</p>
<p>Can't make it to Toronto for Elle's first concert? We've got your back. Show Elle some love and she'll do a shout out with your name on it during the concert or on a special occasion such as your birthday. You can even send a picture and we'll flash it on the screen onstage while Elle sings a song for you.</p>
<h3>Be part of Elle's journey</h3>
<p>Elle's been working so hard to make her dream come true. 16-hour days in the recording studio? Yup, with no complaints. Jam-packed weeks when she's so busy she doesn't even have time to hang with her friends? That's the life when you're so focused on your goal.</p>
<p>With the upcoming release of her first EP, Elle is finally getting to where she wants to be. Contribute to her campaign and be part of her journey.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Good to know we're good to go</h3>
<p>If you've ever seen the movie Rocky, then you probably remember those scenes when Rocky jogs and drinks raw eggs to get ready for his big fight. Elle isn't exactly cracking uncooked eggs into her morning cup but she is training hard for her first concert. At the same time, the team of people supporting her has already started the process of planning this exciting event.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Can you keep a secret? Well that's no fun</h3>
<p>There's a time for keeping quiet and a time for making noise. This is definitely one of those occasions that calls for extremely LOUD NOISE. </p>
<p>Please tell your peeps about Elle Renee and her crowdfunding campaign. Use those Indiegogo share tools and spread the word about this talented singer and songwriter (and she's adorable too, right?).</p>

<h3>The Adventure!</h3>
<p>The idea of ""SPACE"" is born as an album that represents the music I have been wanting to write for some time–a mixture of classical music, with influences of pop and film music. ""SPACE"", like me, is influenced by sci-fi culture. Introducing sonorities of peaceful distant worlds. Occasionally needing the time and space to get away from everything, to disconnect, to leave Earth and enter a calm mindset. </p>
<h3>A task with a lot of Soul!</h3>
<p>I have been working on this project for the past two years, pouring all my heart into its creation and finally launch is imminent.  It all started in 2016 when the idea of ""Captain K"" came to my mind and then to create a sonic universe for his story became a necessity. A universe that extends in mindfulness, perceptive and contemplative.  </p>
<h3>Lets Take Off!</h3>
<p>When you contribute to this campaign, you help me achieve my lifelong dream of creating a cohesive album with a storyline. This project encapsulates my creative spirit. I hope it captures your imagination too.</p>
<p>You can participate by ordering any of the amazing perks; there are piano and djing classes with me. You can also get a private concert for you and your friends... you could even have your own song in the style of ""SPACE"" and of course be the first to listen before the official release!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519323572/l6ifwtjazucucu7aiey6.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Details</h3>
<p>""SPACE"" goes into the studio in April and it will be pre released to all supporters once its production is finished–probably in late May.  Until then you can pledge for the demos as one of the perks offered for the campaign, in case you are dying to have a preview. The official launch will happen later on after the filming of the music video for ""Captain K""  and once ""SPACE"" has found a home label. </p>
<h3>Where Is Your Support Going?</h3>
<p>Your support will enable going to the studio, recording, paying musicians, the sound engineer who will also mix and master the whole thing. The creation of a visual identity for Space (album cover, poster and visuals) filming the music video for the first single of the album and the story of ""Captain K"".</p>
<h3>The Risk</h3>
<p>Having chosen flexible funding means that we will launch into space no matter what. In case we don't reach the goal I will adapt and maybe release fewer songs thus reducing costs. We could also go over the goal, which would mean more support for the official release of the album in terms of promotion. But ""SPACE"" is a reality no matter what happens. </p>
<h3>Share Share Share!</h3>

</div><div><h2>Sobre ""Space""</h2></div><div>
<p>¡Hola! Soy Ricardo Tovar Mateus y estoy a punto de embarcar en esta aventura de crear mi primer álbum. Se trata de un álbum enfocado en la reflexión, música concebida para abrir tu mente e inspirar estados de ánimo cinemáticos y evocar galaxias lejanas. En este proyecto he querido también regresar a mis raíces musicales usando el piano y la voz como instrumentos principales, y relatando historias cercanas a mi alma como la historia del ""Capitán K"". Recuerda que puedes obtener más de una Recompensa... combínalas a tu gusto! </p>
<h3>La Aventura!</h3>
<p>""SPACE"" nace como un álbum cargado de ideas musicales que he estado desarrollando desde hace un tiempo–una combinación de música clásica con pop y música de cine como principales influencias. ""SPACE"" refleja mi pasión por la ciencia ficción, y contiene sonoridades que evocan plácidos mundos distantes. A veces necesitamos encontrar ese punto en el espacio-tiempo en el cual poder perdernos sin miedo, alejarnos de todo lo terreno, desconectarnos y trascender a un estado de paz mental inaccesible de otro modo.</p>
<h3>Un Trabajo Hecho Con el Corazon!</h3>
<p>He dedicado los últimos 2 años de mi vida a la concepción y realización de este proyecto, poniéndole el alma entera, y ahora ha llegado el momento de su lanzamiento. Todo comenzó en 2016, cuando la idea detrás de ""Capitán K"" surgió en mi mente y así también la necesidad de crear un universo sonoro para presentar esta historia–un universo que se extiende en los confines de la mente y que además inspira en mí la más profunda conexión con mis sentidos.</p>
<h3>Y Asi Arrancamos!</h3>
<p>Sumarte a esta campaña es contribuir a hacer realidad mi gran sueño como artista: crear un álbum musical con un concepto narrativo y sólido. ""SPACE"" contiene gran parte de mi espíritu creativo. Espero que sea un trabajo igualmente capaz de capturar tu imaginación.<br/><br/>Puedes participar simplemente escogiendo alguna de las ""estelares"" recompensas que he puesto a tu disposición:  clases particulares de piano o DJ conmigo, o un concierto privado para ti y tus amigos... incluso podrías tener tu propia canción escrita en el estilo de ""SPACE"" y ser el primero en escuchar el álbum antes de su lanzamiento oficial!</p>
<h3>En Detalle</h3>
<p>""SPACE"" será grabado en Abril, y será lanzado anticipadamente para todos los patrocinadores una vez se haya finalizado su post producción hacia finales de Mayo. Hasta entonces podrás obtener los diferentes demos como parte de las recompensas ofrecidas como parte de la campaña, en caso de que no puedas esperar ni un minuto más para echar un vistazo a los avances del proyecto. El lanzamiento oficial se hará tras la filmación del video musical ""Captain K"" (""Capitan K"") y apenas hayamos encontrado un sello discográfico para ""SPACE"".</p>
<h3>Cual es el destino de tu aporte?</h3>
<p>Tu aporte nos permitirá acceder a los estudios de grabación, cubrir los honorarios de los músicos participantes así como del ingeniero de sonido encargado de mezclar y masterizar todo el material, además de posibilitar la creación de una identidad visual para ""SPACE"" (portada del álbum, afiches y visuales), la filmación del video musical del primer sencillo del álbum y la historia del ""Capitán K"".</p>
<h3>Los Riesgos</h3>
<p>Al escoger una meta de financiamiento flexible hemos querido dejar claro que lanzaremos este cohete al espacio pase lo que pase durante la campaña. En caso de no alcanzar la meta de financiamiento, habrá un lanzamiento reducido (menos canciones) para reducir costos. También podríamos ver superadas nuestras expectativas de financiamiento, lo que nos permitiría enfocar una mayor parte del presupuesto hacia la promoción del álbum y su lanzamiento. En cualquier caso, ""SPACE"" es y será una realidad.</p>
<h3>Comparte!</h3>
<p>Mentes calmadas, menos estrés.</p>
<p>En ocasiones, la vida te golpea con un ladrillo... detente, respira profundo y dáte un ""SPACE"".<br/><br/>Si no puedes contribuir, por favor:<br/><br/>Comparte esta campaña con tus amigos en Facebook y etiquétame   (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/rt.mateus/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/rt.mateus/</a>)<br/>Twitea el link y etiquétame @juicymateus<br/>Sígueme en Instagram @mateus_music<br/><br/>Escríbeme, dame tu opinión...

Hasta entonces podrás obtener los diferentes demos como parte de las recompensas ofrecidas como parte de la campaña, en caso de que no puedas esperar ni un minuto más para echar un vistazo a los avances del proyecto. El lanzamiento oficial se hará tras la filmación del video musical ""Captain K"" (""Capitan K"") y apenas hayamos encontrado un sello discográfico para ""SPACE"".
Cual es el destino de tu aporte?
Tu aporte nos permitirá acceder a los estudios de grabación, cubrir los honorarios de los músicos participantes así como del ingeniero de sonido encargado de mezclar y masterizar todo el material, además de posibilitar la creación de una identidad visual para ""SPACE"" (portada del álbum, afiches y visuales), la filmación del video musical del primer sencillo del álbum y la historia del ""Capitán K"".
Los Riesgos
Al escoger una meta de financiamiento flexible hemos querido dejar claro que lanzaremos este cohete al espacio pase lo que pase durante la campaña. En caso de no alcanzar la meta de financiamiento, habrá un lanzamiento reducido (menos canciones) para reducir costos. También podríamos ver superadas nuestras expectativas de financiamiento, lo que nos permitiría enfocar una mayor parte del presupuesto hacia la promoción del álbum y su lanzamiento. En cualquier caso, ""SPACE"" es y será una realidad.

<p>Hello, everyone, I'm Evelyne.</p>
<p>I have been working with artists around the world and helping them to bring an edge to their pop music, for many years, with much success! I’ve even co-written an album published by <a href=""http://www.westonemusic.com/news/Dreamfield-Live"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">West One Music</a>, which was an amazing experience and I consider it a major achievement and milestone in my musical career.</p>
<p>But now, FINALLY, I have written a song, and started an album, which I know will serve as my first professional single as an artist…</p>
<p>Like most of us, I have demons; and, while some of these demons come from within, others are born of traumatic circumstances.</p>
<p>""Wasted"", my first single, was written about one such incident, and when I played back the demo I'd recorded of it, I knew it was time to move forward as an artist. I'd found my ""sound"" (dark, moody, truth-telling soul-pop).</p>
<p>I was feeling exhausted and sad, reminiscing on an awful experience I’d previously had in my life that continues to haunt me today. I sat down to my keyboard. I dug deep into that pain and emotion and just played. What happened next was a state of flow and creativity that resulted in this song. </p>
<p>A few days later, still wondering what to do with this song, I got a call from James Sanger (<a href=""http://www.vibeystudios.com/about-james-sanger.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.vibeystudios.com/about-james-sanger....</a>) and we discussed and decided that we would work together on this song.</p>
<p>James has worked with some of the most influential artists of our time; Dido, Adele and Keane to name just a few, and these artists, incidentally, have been some of my main influencers growing up.</p>
<p>‘Wasted’ is a song that most of us can relate to, most of us have experienced the pain within the song. But the personal aspects I have weaved into the song make it a dark, sonic and soulful piece with a unique side that will have people asking for more to understand the full story. As a contributor to this initial campaign, you will allow me to begin what is likely to be the most difficult, beautiful and cathartic experience of my life. And you join me on the journey!</p>

<p>What you'll get is exclusive updates on the progress of the song, a signed copy of the single when it releases - and sneak peaks into the music video we're shooting for the song. :)</p>

<h2>What The Hell Is A Brass Band?</h2>
<p>West Grand Brass Band is a 6-piece group based out of Oakland, CA, consisting of one Saxophone, one Trumpet, two Trombones, one Drummer, and a Tuba.</p>
<p>We have been partying throughout the Bay Area since 2014, when we got our start supporting the Hot Pink Feathers at Carnaval. Shortly after, we started busking at the park at Lake Merritt, bringing the party to the people enjoying their Saturday mornings at the park and the farmer's market. These busking sessions, in addition to allowing us to develop our sound in a low-pressure environment, led to a number of other opportunities (including the East Bay Jazz Festival.)</p>
<p>Despite our traditional brass band roots, we have been working hard to push the envelope with what can be done using brass instruments and electronic effects. This debut album will be a showcase of this new style, a genre we like to call BDM (Brass Dance Music).</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Birth Of BDM</h2>
<p>Over the past year each of us has slowly been building up our pedalboards to create the biggest, fattest sound we can. The idea of running horns through some effects is certainly not new, but the scale we are bringing to this idea is. By using synth pedals, auto-wahs, delays, and electronic drums, we are able to turn the tunes we play acoustically into full-blown electronic soundscapes capable of boosting any party or DJ set.</p>
<p>We are super stoked on this sound and love performing at parties and bars around the Bay Area, but what we really want is to bring our show to the rest of the world. In addition to distributing our music on worldwide platforms like Spotify and iTunes, having a high-quality example of our unique sound will allow us to apply to your favorite festivals.</p>
<p>BDM may be a term that we are coining, but we also want to see how far this sound can go. By putting our ideas out there, we hope to inspire other brass musicians to explore the limits of their sound. There aren't many models to follow for horn players looking to incorporate electronic effects into their performances, and we would love to help make that knowledge more accessible. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>Quid Pro Quo</h2>
<p>Albums are expensive, especially with larger bands and lots of effects. Fortunately, we know just what it will take to make this happen. In the fall of 2017 we recorded a 3-song demo with David Simon-Baker at Allegiant Records (<a href=""http://allegiantrecords.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.allegiantrecords.com</a>). This was an opportunity for us to test the feasibility and cost of recording horns in a way not many people have done before. (If you're curious, you can find one of the songs from the demo in our video.) While we have saved up some of the money we need to make this album happen, there is quite a large price-tag involved with this type of recording:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recording <strong>live</strong> is crucial to our sound. As a dance band, we just can't capture the energy without all playing together at the same time.</li>
<li>Adding <strong>effects</strong> is a separate process, and the most experimental part of what we do. We want to make sure we have enough time to properly explore the boundaries of our sound in a studio setting.</li>
<li>Each track needs to be properly <strong>mixed</strong> and <strong>mastered</strong> to make the most of the effects.</li>
<li>In order to really satisfy your eardrums, we'll be skipping physical cds and offering our album on vinyl instead (as well as digital downloads in all the usual formats.) Producing <strong>vinyl</strong> requires an additional round of mastering to make the best use of the medium.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, we don't expect you to give without getting anything back! We believe firmly in sharing the love, and have some awesome rewards to share with you. We've tailored these perks to help make sure that as much of your money as possible goes to what you really want: a great album.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I've been playing music professionally full-time since 2009, and I've recorded two albums - ""Allons-y! Time Traveler's Tunes"" with songs from the 13th - 21st centuries, and ""Dance The Knight Away"" with dance songs from 1445-1657.  I play hurdy gurdy, bowed psaltery, flute, pennywhistle, bodhran, piano/toy piano, and dabble in many other instruments, like harp, trumpet, and guitar.  Having expressed my love of Medieval and Renaissance music, I now want to celebrate my inner (not-at-all hidden) geek through music! This album will pay tribute to my favorite board games, video games, RPGs, books, TV shows, and other things I enjoy, like pirates, knitting, unconventional pets, octopus baristas, and Renaissance faires.</p>
<p>In this campaign, I'm raising money to allow me to record this album at Soundwright Studio in Texas, with the amazing Tree Leom, and to get it professionally mixed and mastered.  This is where you come in!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My goal for this campaign is $1,500.  From past experience, the album will cost about $2,000 to record, but I have half of that in personal funds set aside to start the recording process.  The other $500 will go towards mixing and mastering the album.  If I can hit my stretch goal of $2,500, then the additional $1,000 will go towards having the album manufactured in eco-friendly, minimal-plastic cases with 6 panels (instead of the usual 4), so I can provide even more artwork, information, and lyrics.</p>
<p>As a thank you for backing this project, you can pick any of a number of perks, including the new CD in digital and/or physical form, t-shirts (with adorable hedgehog art), a gift pack of the new CD (all of your gift shopping for 10 people done in just a few clicks!), and my entire catalog of albums in digital and/or physical form.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Since I'm an independent artist, I don't have large funds coming in from a label or other high-powered contributor.  It takes a community of individuals who all believe in what I'm doing to give life to my music, and allow me to continue to create beauty and joy!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If I don't reach my goal, then all of the money raised will still go towards the production of the album, but I'll need to use personal money to finish it, which will delay the completion date.  All perks will be sent out, but you'd have to wait longer to receive them if the goal isn't met.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Whether you can or can't contribute, you can still help!  Share this campaign with your friends and family, post about it on social media, and shout about it on the street corner (well, OK; maybe not that last one).  The biggest downfall of many campaigns is that people just don't know about them.  With your help, we can make this geeky labor of love happen!  Allons-y!</p>

<p><i>""I will tell you my life story -- it's a cautionary tale<br/>All the years of guts and glory in the belly of the whale""</i></p>
<p>I'm a songwriter based in Somerville, MA. I started writing songs about 7 years ago and have been working on this collection for the last 3 or 4 years. We released a debut album in 2014, and since then I've been performing and touring throughout the eastern United States.</p>
<p>I've been working with several amazing musicians to help me make these songs come to life, many of whom have been with me since the beginning. Ariel Bernstein at <a href=""https://dimensionsoundstudios.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dimension Sound Studios</a>, who has recently worked with Darlingside and the Ballroom Thieves, is producing and engineering. We are featuring Ethan Robbins, from <a href=""http://www.coldchocolatemusic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cold Chocolate</a>, on guitar and vocals. The album contains 12 original songs, two of which I co-wrote with my friend <a href=""https://www.andrewdelaneymusic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Delaney</a>. </p>
<p>I'm really excited about these songs. ""Until the Words Are Gone"" touches on themes of connection and communication. I feel like these songs are especially relevant to the world of 2017. Some of them are love songs, some are break-up songs, and some of them are topical songs. All of them come from my perspective as an artist and human struggling to find meaningful connections in a confusing world.</p>
<p>""Cunning Folk"" took me from humble beginnings to living as a professional songwriter and performer. I'm hoping this new project will take me and my music even further. Arts funding is endangered, and artists are relying more than ever on a community of devoted fans. Your contribution will help pay several working musicians and ensure I can take the next step in my career. It also ensures that we can get this album out into the hands of as many people as possible. For the first time, I'll be pressing vinyl LPs. We also have some cool exclusive swag for you to choose from.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p><i>""And if I feel lonely<br/>I’m just longing for a constellation<br/>A line between our bright suns burning""</i></p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of my anticipated costs:</p>
<p>Recording Studio:      $1300<br/>Musicians:                    $2000<br/>Production/Mixing:   $2000<br/>Mastering:                     $500<br/>Art &amp; Design:                $500<br/>CD Manufacturing:     $1000<br/>Vinyl Manufacturing: $2500<br/>Fundraising Fees:       $1500<br/>Publicity:                       $4000</p>
<p>TOTAL:         At least $15,300</p>
<p>That's a somewhat modest estimate, leaving out the cost of creating some of the perks and possible unanticipated shipping costs, and still more than my goal. But it leaves a little flexibility in the promotional side, so a full-fledged marketing campaign is more of a flex goal.</p>
<p>Some of our unique perks include laser-engraved flasks, tote bags, and T-shirts, all featuring my original artwork. I've updated my octopus &amp; mermaid ""Friends With Benefits"" logo for this project, and you can now get it printed on a tote bag! I also have exclusive one-of-a-kind original artwork you can purchase (see the gallery for a photo), or you can have me come to your home and play a concert in your living room!</p>

<h3>The Songs</h3>
<p><i>""Oh, lover, won't you sing me something in a different key<br/>For the dreamers and the frogs, and Oscar Wilde and me...""</i></p>
<p>In case you're wondering, here are the 12 songs currently being recorded, in no particular order! I'll add links to some more live versions &amp; demos of these during the campaign as availability permits!<br/><i>For Frogs &amp; Oscar Wilde</i><br/><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SW0oPYePIg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>How I Became a Villain</i></a><br/><i>Broken</i><br/><i>Hoarse<br/>AloneTogether<br/><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyUtruZVKAo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Catcallin' Blues</a></i><br/><i>Arrows &amp; Slings</i><br/><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laTvMe_mQYU"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Someone</i></a> (co-written with Andrew Delaney)<br/><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2CPNnibg7Y"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Like We Used To</i></a> (co-written with Andrew Delaney)<br/><i>99 Bottles<br/>Perfect Rhyme</i><br/><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rWdUxJLfjM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Everything But Love</i></a></p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p><i>""And I’m afraid the world’s gone crazy<br/>Where to go? Just what is true?<br/>But I know, I can face it, babe,<br/>If I stand right here with you…""</i></p>
<p>These 12 songs have been in the works for a few years now, and I know some folks have been waiting for me to make this record! Some of the lyrics got modified after the November election. These songs focus on communication, as well as celebrating individualism and the struggle to make positive change in the world. I also feel like ""Catcallin' Blues"" is a great, lighthearted take on a relevant topic.</p>
<p>In 2013, I ran a successful Kickstarter campaign to fund my first album, ""Cunning Folk,"" and released that album in July of 2014. Since then, I have ordered a second printing of that CD and continue to sell it at shows and online.</p>
<p>This is not an easy thing to do, and I will go unpaid for many hours I'm logging at the computer or stuffing envelopes. That stuff is a labor of love, and I consider it a great privilege to be able to earn a meagre living doing this. It's hard to quantify exactly what music is worth, especially when so much of it is available for free. But writing these songs has saved my life over and over again. I hope hearing them will mean just a fraction as much to you.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><i>""I have gambled with high stakes,<br/>Seen accidents and earthquakes""</i><br/><br/>​I decided to do a flexible funding campaign for this project because I don't like the stress of an all-or-nothing campaign and feeling like I'm pushing something down people's throats. However, this means that I could potentially make a small portion of my goal and still have to produce an album. If this were to happen, the funds received will get me as far as possible with the recording project, but falling short of budget would delay the release considerably. Still, I'm confident we can meet this goal and either way we'll make a great record!</p>
<p>I'm also doing a lot of this on my own while continuing to book and play shows and work on graphic design projects, so I need some flexibility on the turnaround time. I'm waiting to set a firm release date until after the record is mixed and I've made a decision about publicity. But I'm confident that we will prevail! I have a great team of musicians and a wonderful network of friends, family, and fans. (Pssst: Help me spread the word!) <br/><br/>In the worst-case scenario, I will have to do my publicity myself, which means things will move much more slowly with the release, and the album may not get into as many hands as quickly as hoped. It may take me up to a year (or more) to fulfill custom rewards. I've learned a lot since my Kickstarter, and now know to place a much higher value on rewards that require materials or customization. At the end of the day, as long as I can keep myself afloat, the art will go on!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p><i>""And I'm not the kind to take a crutch,<br/>But you'd still come through in the clutch""</i><br/><br/>Every dollar helps, and small contributions will add up. But even if you contribute financially, that doesn't mean you can't still help:</p>

I'm really excited about these songs. ""Until the Words Are Gone"" touches on themes of connection and communication. I feel like these songs are especially relevant to the world of 2017. Some of them are love songs, some are break-up songs, and some of them are topical songs. All of them come from my perspective as an artist and human struggling to find meaningful connections in a confusing world.
""Cunning Folk"" took me from humble beginnings to living as a professional songwriter and performer. I'm hoping this new project will take me and my music even further. Arts funding is endangered, and artists are relying more than ever on a community of devoted fans. Your contribution will help pay several working musicians and ensure I can take the next step in my career. It also ensures that we can get this album out into the hands of as many people as possible. For the first time, I'll be pressing vinyl LPs. We also have some cool exclusive swag for you to choose from.
What We Need & What You Get

""And if I feel lonelyI’m just longing for a constellationA line between our bright suns burning""
Here's a breakdown of my anticipated costs:
Recording Studio:      $1300Musicians:                    $2000Production/Mixing:   $2000Mastering:                     $500Art & Design:                $500CD Manufacturing:     $1000Vinyl Manufacturing: $2500Fundraising Fees:       $1500Publicity:                       $4000
TOTAL:         At least $15,300
That's a somewhat modest estimate, leaving out the cost of creating some of the perks and possible unanticipated shipping costs, and still more than my goal. But it leaves a little flexibility in the promotional side, so a full-fledged marketing campaign is more of a flex goal.
Some of our unique perks include laser-engraved flasks, tote bags, and T-shirts, all featuring my original artwork. I've updated my octopus & mermaid ""Friends With Benefits"" logo for this project, and you can now get it printed on a tote bag! I also have exclusive one-of-a-kind original artwork you can purchase (see the gallery for a photo), or you can have me come to your home and play a concert in your living room!

The Songs
""Oh, lover, won't you sing me something in a different keyFor the dreamers and the frogs, and Oscar Wilde and me...""
In case you're wondering, here are the 12 songs currently being recorded, in no particular order! I'll add links to some more live versions & demos of these during the campaign as availability permits!For Frogs & Oscar WildeHow I Became a VillainBrokenHoarseAloneTogetherCatcallin' BluesArrows & SlingsSomeone (co-written with Andrew Delaney)Like We Used To (co-written with Andrew Delaney)99 BottlesPerfect RhymeEverything But Love
Impact

""And I’m afraid the world’s gone crazyWhere to go? Just what is true?But I know, I can face it, babe,If I stand right here with you…""
These 12 songs have been in the works for a few years now, and I know some folks have been waiting for me to make this record! Some of the lyrics got modified after the November election. These songs focus on communication, as well as celebrating individualism and the struggle to make positive change in the world. I also feel like ""Catcallin' Blues"" is a great, lighthearted take on a relevant topic.
In 2013, I ran a successful Kickstarter campaign to fund my first album, ""Cunning Folk,"" and released that album in July of 2014. Since then, I have ordered a second printing of that CD and continue to sell it at shows and online.
This is not an easy thing to do, and I will go unpaid for many hours I'm logging at the computer or stuffing envelopes. That stuff is a labor of love, and I consider it a great privilege to be able to earn a meagre living doing this. It's hard to quantify exactly what music is worth, especially when so much of it is available for free. But writing these songs has saved my life over and over again. I hope hearing them will mean just a fraction as much to you.

Risks & Challenges
""I have gambled with high stakes,Seen accidents and earthquakes""​I decided to do a flexible funding campaign for this project because I don't like the stress of an all-or-nothing campaign and feeling like I'm pushing something down people's throats. However, this means that I could potentially make a small portion of my goal and still have to produce an album. If this were to happen, the funds received will get me as far as possible with the recording project, but falling short of budget would delay the release considerably. Still, I'm confident we can meet this goal and either way we'll make a great record!
I'm also doing a lot of this on my own while continuing to book and play shows and work on graphic design projects, so I need some flexibility on the turnaround time. I'm waiting to set a firm release date until after the record is mixed and I've made a decision about publicity. But I'm confident that we will prevail! I have a great team of musicians and a wonderful network of friends, family, and fans. (Pssst: Help me spread the word!) In the worst-case scenario, I will have to do my publicity myself, which means things will move much more slowly with the release, and the album may not get into as many hands as quickly as hoped. It may take me up to a year (or more) to fulfill custom rewards. I've learned a lot since my Kickstarter, and now know to place a much higher value on rewards that require materials or customization. At the end of the day, as long as I can keep myself afloat, the art will go on!

The trend is to number 1. It is the right time.  Will you go there with me? What We Need & What You Get

I'm ready. But the process is complicated and expensive.
As we did last year, we researched the team and the costs. This is how it breaks down...
Production Costs Per Song
In an email from Nick at SkyFalls Studio  he broke down the costs per song like this; 

-pre production/writing (depending on how prepared the song is, hours could vary)  - (This doesn't include hiring additional musicians if needed.)
-additional musicians, arrangers. 
-recording process (usually will be around 10-14 hours per song) -

Subtotal cost per song : $2,700 (10 songs) plus pressing. graphic design and advertising. 
Our goal is $ $34,000

The Impact
I've been writing since I was five. I'm 16 now. Your contributions will mean the difference between world class production and none at all, because I won't put out a halfway song:

Last year we moved slowly. Many artist jump from stage (or garage) to the studio.  I believe we have a successful track record with projects like this because we ask question and do what is suggested.

Risks & Challenges
It won't be easy to complete 5 songs during a school year. My grades have to stay where they are 3.8 or higher. My friends are very dear to me and I need to keep their friendship. And there's always chores and the side jobs cleaning, babysitting, and now painting. 
I'd love to just play out for money, but there are age restrictions in the bars. And my dad is very careful about the places we play. But we have a plan for all these things. 

The recording schedule will be set for my vocals and guitar on weekend sessions, in the afternoon.
Once the homeworks done, hanging out is OK... in fact I often hang out with my friends and we all do homework together.
I've been an A student through a lot of changes over the past years. My family helps a lot. And we won't be playing late night gigs during school nights. It always comes first.

Hi, we are Indie Rehab Records and between the four of us on the team we have over 20 years worth of experience on stage performing and behind the scenes recording others and now we want to take that to the next level.


The current business model in the record industry is years behind where it should be and we want to move things on by inviting people in to come up with new ideas and give credit where it is due by having an open office policy and arranging weekly open discussions with ordinary people with extraordinary ideas. 


With your help we look to not only provide jobs and free training/experience in the local area to begin with but a new type of service for artists that are fed up of the current record industry standard. The money raised will go something like this 



Where Will The Money Go?


The money raised will go something like this:
£10,000 on studio equipment
£3,000 on permanent residence and soundproofing
£4,000 to complete perk commitments (if the full target is reached)
£3,000 booking venues and arranging travel nationwide for artists to play
£5,000 for promotion and stalls at small festivals and on the radio/newspapers
Anything extra would go towards equipment for the radio show to do outside interviews and live recordings as well.



What We Need & What You Get 

Most of the perks we have on offer are a discounted service that we will either invite you down to the studio in Manchester to complete or will send out to you with only a few options to show some love for nothing.
And, any and all the funds raised will be going towards new equipment, booking bigger venues and if you hit the intern perk then we will be taking more people along for the ride with us and we can spend more time training and we aim to keep everyone up to date with anything that is happening.
We also have a unique position of putting out a weekly radio show as well (The Indie Rehab Hour), offering air time and promotions through alternative methods as well.

Risks & Challenges 

 We want to take our recordings from this:

to the next level and without your help it may take a lot longer to do.

I am a producer,  writer, and  musician from West Philadelphia, PA.</p><p>I've been making music since I was a kid. At the age of 7, I started rapping with my older brother. Back in 2001, due to my brother being unable to make beats for me because of his various projects, I started making beats of my own. After a while, the desire to rap was diminishing while my love for beat-making and producing flourished. In 2007, I started to learn how to play the guitar. I was a roadie and graphic designer for a local band, Joe Jordan's eXperiment. Since there was always a guitar around, I taught myself how to play. I host a series of  online radio shows called BaccYard Recordz Radio or #BYRR where I play local music and beats... And now... Here we are!!<br/><br/>Initially, I was selling beat packages at discounted rates so I can attend Full Sail in a few months.

I am a producer,  writer, and  musician from West Philadelphia, PA.I've been making music since I was a kid. At the age of 7, I started rapping with my older brother. Back in 2001, due to my brother being unable to make beats for me because of his various projects, I started making beats of my own. After a while, the desire to rap was diminishing while my love for beat-making and producing flourished. In 2007, I started to learn how to play the guitar. I was a roadie and graphic designer for a local band, Joe Jordan's eXperiment. Since there was always a guitar around, I taught myself how to play. I host a series of  online radio shows called BaccYard Recordz Radio or #BYRR where I play local music and beats... And now... Here we are!!Initially, I was selling beat packages at discounted rates so I can attend Full Sail in a few months. Due to lack of backers, I haven't been able to successfully meet my goal of $7,000 so I am just raising $2,000 for a  portable studio which includes:                  A Laptop; A microphone; a midi keyboard; Fl Studio 12 Producer Edition; Studio speakers and an external hard drive.  Music is my life!

We are raising money to enable us to buy a tour bus. Costs on a tour are high and extreme on the road for any band and while we know that this is a given for any working musician we would love your help to fund a new bus for our 2016 tour.</p><p>Having our own home on the road would reduce costs for venues hiring us, which would in turn enable us to perform at more gigs. In most cases venues do not provide accommodation so we either pay ourselves for local hotels, guest houses etc, or we would be put up in people's homes which means the band has to split up and this causes extra stress on the road. </p><p>In a perfect world with a proper touring bus, we would all be together, writing the next 10 albums on the road :) We would also be able to hire a driver which means I wouldn't be exhausted whilst performing after driving for 8 to 24 hours, sometimes to the point of collapsing. It takes that to get anywhere from Northern Ireland. We want to give you the best show possible and boy do we put on a show! Currently we have a converted mini bus (G-Bus) that is barely hanging together and will not make it through another tour sadly and as much as the G-Bus has been our home for the last two years we have run it into the ground with so many boats, roads and pot holes and it really wasn't built for the overload of the Kaz Hawkins Band.</p><p>Although we have had many invitations and offers to play in Europe, we have unfortunately had to decline them all, as the high costs of travel from Northern Ireland mean that so far we've only been able to afford to gig in the UK. By helping us eliminate accommodation costs, you can positively and directly help us spread the word into Europe and entertain those wonderful fans there that have supported us so magnificently on our journey so far.<br/></p><p><strong>We do not have a record label, we are totally independent and self-funded!</strong></p><p>We have been collecting awards since 2012 with the biggest ones recently from <b>British Blues Awards</b> gaining the <strong>Barry Middleton Memorial Award</strong> for <strong>Emerging Artist.</strong> We also won best <strong>Studio Album of 2015</strong> for our debut 'Get Ready' from <strong>Blues Matters Magazine </strong>and <b>Best Female Act </b>in Ireland at <b>Pure M Magazine Music Awards 2015</b>.

Your name will appear in print on the sleeve and possibly on a dedicated track as a thank you for helping us spread our music further. We will also be creating a special <strong>fan monument</strong> on the bus with all your names so that you are with us wherever we go.</p><p><b>WHY SO MUCH MONEY?</b></p><p>At present we have six band members, three male, three female, which means six bunks in a touring van. A typical new and fitted out transit bus or van new can easily cost £100,000, but we have our feet firmly planted on the ground and know that a more modest second hand touring conversion, albeit one that's already had a few adventures, would be within our reach with your help. We have chosen Indiegogo's flexible funding option so that we can receive your donations whether we meet our £20,000 target or not. If we do not reach our target we will continue fundraising outside Indiegogo until we reach the amount we need. What's great about this campaign, is that it gives us the amazing opportunity for you to continue donating even after the campaign deadline ends.</p><p><strong>SPONSORSHIP</strong></p><p>A lot of bands depend on endorsements and sponsorships to tour. We <strong>don't </strong>have this but if <strong>YOU </strong>are a business and would like to sponsor or endorse us we are prepared to carry signage on the road. If you want to see your business travel with us please email our PR Officer at <strong>franbarlet@hotmail.com </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong>SOCIAL MEDIA</strong></strong></p><strong>

We are raising money to enable us to buy a tour bus. Costs on a tour are high and extreme on the road for any band and while we know that this is a given for any working musician we would love your help to fund a new bus for our 2016 tour.Having our own home on the road would reduce costs for venues hiring us, which would in turn enable us to perform at more gigs. In most cases venues do not provide accommodation so we either pay ourselves for local hotels, guest houses etc, or we would be put up in people's homes which means the band has to split up and this causes extra stress on the road. In a perfect world with a proper touring bus, we would all be together, writing the next 10 albums on the road :) We would also be able to hire a driver which means I wouldn't be exhausted whilst performing after driving for 8 to 24 hours, sometimes to the point of collapsing. It takes that to get anywhere from Northern Ireland. We want to give you the best show possible and boy do we put on a show! Currently we have a converted mini bus (G-Bus) that is barely hanging together and will not make it through another tour sadly and as much as the G-Bus has been our home for the last two years we have run it into the ground with so many boats, roads and pot holes and it really wasn't built for the overload of the Kaz Hawkins Band.Although we have had many invitations and offers to play in Europe, we have unfortunately had to decline them all, as the high costs of travel from Northern Ireland mean that so far we've only been able to afford to gig in the UK. By helping us eliminate accommodation costs, you can positively and directly help us spread the word into Europe and entertain those wonderful fans there that have supported us so magnificently on our journey so far.We do not have a record label, we are totally independent and self-funded!We have been collecting awards since 2012 with the biggest ones recently from British Blues Awards gaining the Barry Middleton Memorial Award for Emerging Artist. We also won best Studio Album of 2015 for our debut 'Get Ready' from Blues Matters Magazine and Best Female Act in Ireland at Pure M Magazine Music Awards 2015. Another recent award is the Blues & Soul Magazine 2014 Rising Star Award. Many other nominations over the past 3 years include FINALIST-FUTURE OF THE BLUES UK 2015NOMINEE-European Blues Challenge, Classic Rock Blues Magazine 2014NOMINEE: BRITISH BLUES AWARDS, BEST FEMALE VOCALIST 2014NOMINEE: BRITISH BLUES AWARD  BEST ORIGINAL SONGWRITER 2013WINNER: MRU Awards BEST BLUES/ROCK ACT 2012NOMINEE: MRU Awards BEST SINGLE 2012 WHY SHOULD YOU HELP US?We value you all so much and we hope this will help us get to YOUR city, YOUR town or YOUR country. With our own tour bus the world is open for discovery and we could literally roll up and bring our show to you, who have been waiting so long to see us. In our PERKS for this campaign we will be adding every name from donations on our next release, which for now is a big secret but you will find out before anyone else when the next release is due via this campaign. Your name will appear in print on the sleeve and possibly on a dedicated track as a thank you for helping us spread our music further. We will also be creating a special fan monument on the bus with all your names so that you are with us wherever we go.WHY SO MUCH MONEY?At present we have six band members, three male, three female, which means six bunks in a touring van. A typical new and fitted out transit bus or van new can easily cost £100,000, but we have our feet firmly planted on the ground and know that a more modest second hand touring conversion, albeit one that's already had a few adventures, would be within our reach with your help. We have chosen Indiegogo's flexible funding option so that we can receive your donations whether we meet our £20,000 target or not. If we do not reach our target we will continue fundraising outside Indiegogo until we reach the amount we need. What's great about this campaign, is that it gives us the amazing opportunity for you to continue donating even after the campaign deadline ends.SPONSORSHIPA lot of bands depend on endorsements and sponsorships to tour. We don't have this but if YOU are a business and would like to sponsor or endorse us we are prepared to carry signage on the road. If you want to see your business travel with us please email our PR Officer at franbarlet@hotmail.com SOCIAL MEDIA
Please hook up with us on social media, we love new people. We have also just discovered Periscope so will be broadcasting especially for you if you look at our campaign perks.

BIO DU BAND
Fondé par l'auteure, compositrice et interprète Em Pompa, BELLFLOWER est un groupe montréalais indépendant formé de neuf musicien(ne)s et ami(e)s: Em Pompa (voix, percussions, guitare), Kat Samman (voix, percussions), William Côté (batterie, voix, guitare), Jérémi Roy (basse, synthbass), Jérôme Beaulieu (piano, claviers), Félix Petit (sax, samplings), Alex Dodier (sax), Nicolas Boulay (trompette, flugelhorn), Marie-Noëlle Bois (sax, voix).

Depuis 2013, le groupe a lancé un album (The Lotus Factor), fait plusieurs concerts (dont un passage remarqué au Festival Vue sur la Relève 2015 où la formation a remporté 12 prix coups-de-pouce) et présenté une nouvelle pièce enregistrée live au MMR Studio de McGill:



MAINTENANT...
Trois ans après les débuts du projet, le groupe s'apprête à enregistrer son deuxième album et voici comment ça va se passer:

<p><b>History of Fusion</b><b></b></p>
<p>Fusion Kung Fu was founded in 2014 by head instructor Michelle Pleasant. Our history is brief, having only been around for two years, but we are growing every quarter and plan to continue that growth in the future. We have a strong focus on core strength, proper alignment, working hard, and having fun.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>The Fusion Philosophy</b></p>
<p>Training in the martial arts can be an amazing tool for the development of one’s mind, body and spirit, and, the unification of them in order to navigate one’s life in a holistic manner. While the physical components of martial arts is largely studied throughout the world, the deeper rewards of the arts lie in the philosophy and the knowledge one can gain about themselves and their interactions with the world at large.</p>
<p>The Fusion philosophy is one of wholeness. Our mission is to improve the quality of people’s lives through discipline, consciousness and empowerment. We develop awareness through disciplined martial arts training which include a very diverse range of philosophies and physical exercises.</p>
<p>The combination of intense physical training and an in depth introspection of oneself creates a profound self awareness that has the potential to change one’s life in magical ways. Combining the seemingly contrary arts (Kajukenbo Kung Fu, Yoga, Aikido and Tai Chi) creates a unique learning environment in which balance, perseverance, harmony and acceptance are strongly encouraged and nurtured.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong>Vision for the Future</strong></p>
<p>Our core vision for the immediate future is to continue to offer enriching classes taught by skilled teachers. We also plan to start offering more community classes free of charge in yoga and aikido, and are exploring the idea starting a kid’s program. </p>
<p>Our long term vision is to have a full class schedule with a huge range of movement classes, including: Kung Fu, Yoga, Aikido, Nia, personal training, group fitness classes, free self defense classes, fee-based self defense classes for starters! All with classes will be taught with the shared passion for the healing power of movement and how it can transform lives.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>What your generosity will foster:</b></p>
<p>• Make possible free community classes in self defense and aikido • Help us purchase desperately needed equipment such as mats, heavy bag stands, sparring equipment, kick shields, exercise balls, medicine balls for starters! • Mirrors • Storage cubbies • Weapons for training • Chin up bar • And perhaps most importantly, scholarships for those who cannot afford to train.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Us</b></p>
<p>We are a diverse group of individuals who come together to train in a mutually respectful environment. We have fun, work hard, push our boundaries and did we say we have fun? Because we do. We love what this art has to offer and can't wait to share it with others!</p>

</h3>
<div>20 years, I picked up a guitar and took my first lesson.  Since then, the music has poured through, but never found a home in the recording studio.  That changed this year when instead of acoustic guitar, I switched to classical guitar, just after returning from Turkey.  I added the beautiful and lush Turkish folk guitar, Baglama Saz, to my repertoire of sounds.  Both instruments have added layers of organic spice to my DJ sets, but the pure and raw sounds of the instruments on their own, with a bit of bell-stomping has asked for the first of many studio albums.<br/>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Receive</h3> <p>Producing, Mixing, and Mastering album is both a time-consuming and money-investing process.  Each of these stages of the album recording process is assisted by your generous donation.</p>
<p>I will be touring at festivals this summer 2015 in Colorado, Arizona, and the East Coast.  Your support will fund the album's release in time for the tour.</p>
<p>As a professional Life Coach and Astrologer, I wanted to include the special perks of astrology readings into your donations.  You get to learn deeply about life purpose, relationships, career path, forecasting, or your optimum locations, while supporting the realization of this project.</p>
<p>I've also included perks such as my books on astrology and consciousness and some of my original visionary photography.</p>
<p>My longer term vision includes traveling to countries in both South America and Europe and playing these unique songs—more like shamanic journeys—out in city center plazas and maybe on stages with collaborators, especially dancers, hoopers, and fire spinners.  In addition, I plan to continue to layer these organic elements into future live DJ sets.</p>

We need your help to keep moving forward with booking the studios and lining up the mixing engineers and cover artists. </div>
<div>Once we have a completed CD, we need to send it out to radio stations, and perform in as many venues as we can to spread the word and build a connection to people. In these modern times, it's important that we spread hope and offer people a reminder of all our common human joys. Music is the perfect medium for that. This album of songs contain messages of hope and perseverance. You can help us light up the world with our vibrant message. </div>
<div>We've spent years honing our talent and the songs, tirelessly performed in clubs, festivals, and casinos. Time after time, people who've never heard us before light up and get grooving. It is a powerful thing to experience connecting with people for the first time. Watching as the music moves them and ignites their smiles. This Album represents our calling card to the future. </div>
<div>Your support will make it all possible.! We will be eternally grateful, and continue to broaden our audience in years to come. </div>

<p>“Experience builds character, says singer-songwriter Clark Paterson.” You have to do shit to truly write great songs.”</p>
<p>From the family farm to the Chicago School of Folk Music; from the high-dollar world of Windy City real estate to seeing the world from a backpack; and from a string of dingy honky tonks to a home, finally, in Nashville, Tennessee, Clark brings worlds of experience to his 35 years on the planet––and to his third and latest record, <i>The Final Tradition</i>. </p>
<p>“I’ve been around/ Tonight, I’m back in town/ Straight-up and battle-hard/ I’m parked in the neighbor’s yard”––“If I Don’t Win”</p>
<p>Recorded in Nashville by indie producer <i>par excellence</i> Eric McConnell (Todd Snider, Loretta Lynn, Will Kimbrough), <i>The Final Tradition</i> is no sunny travelogue. Clark’s songs have real narrative force and reflect the darkness and raw energy typically found in vintage country and punk––call it Grindhouse Country. </p>
<p>“I swore I’d never take the fall/ You haven’t seen the things I saw/ Boxed my heart outta my skull/ I entertained them one and all…”––“This Dog Is Gonna Hunt”</p>
<p>Assisting Clark and Eric are some of the Nashville indie scene’s grittiest players, including steel guitarist Paul Niehaus (Lambchop, Calexico), drummer John McTigue (Raul Malo, Brazilbilly), and Tim Carroll (Elizabeth Cook, Todd Snider). An experienced bunch, they know how to scream out of the gate, such as on “Kansas Saturday Night,” a scorched earth rave-up that would recall The Slits or Social Distortion but for McConnell’s atmospheric production. Songs like “My Hands Know The Touch,” a Crazy Horse-ish waltz, on the other hand, demonstrate that Clark’s friends can punch hard while deftly staying out of the way. </p>
<p>“I got friends down the mines/ I got friends that work construction/ I got girls I think are fine wearing shirts that I unbutton/ I got friends out in Iraq who will always have my back/ I got everything I need/ I got blood enough to bleed”––“Hillbilly Shit”</p>
<p>Clark was raised on his family’s spread near Sandusky, Michigan. “I never once was drunk in high school,” he says. It took Loyola University in Chicago to make that happen. After graduation, Clark took off for a few years with only a backpack and his guitar. “I became a backpacker-dude and had a good run. I’ve played country music in Eastern Europe, South America, Japan, Sweden, Finland and England. I've also been robbed, beaten, and deported. </p>
<p>“Daddy’s favorite farmhand taught me about life/ Taught me about women/ And how to use a knife/ Taught me about sadness/ How to see it in the eyes/ The world is hard for living/ Makes us sacrifice”––“Moonlight In The Hills”</p>
<p>“In the road or in the ditch/ Poor as Hell or filthy rich/ Blow-out win or flat-out skunked/ This dog is gonna hunt”––“This Dog Is Gonna Hunt” </p>
<p>Ultimately, <i>The Final Tradition</i> resists categorization. Clark, himself, resists categorization, too, although he’s happy to share his experiences. “I think the record has a sense of story and purpose that most current records don't,” he says. “I play guitar and focus on writing music that appeals to me and is not being done on the radio. I love old country because it’s earnest and has an edge and there is a narrative that is largely missing from modern music. I love the darkness and the fact that it’s polarizing. And I love 70s punk rock like Iggy and The Stooges, The Ramones, and The Clash. It has balls and a message and always felt honest. I also really really love Nick Cave….”</p>
<p>“If your parents like your music, you’re doing something wrong.”––Clark Paterson</p>
<p>I need your help to get the music out there. I'm asking for a total of $10,000.00 to fund the pressing of the records, expanding the website, printing cd's, making t-shirts, and marketing the album so it may reach it's full potential.I love this album and I know you will too.</p>
<p>If you like the music, please share it with your friends. Heck, direct them to this page where they can get their own copy of the new album.</p>

Our diverse roots converge on this CD, bringing together the music of Hungarian, Latin American and North American composers. This recording offers a delectable variety of music from the W.F. Bach Duo Sonata that became the root of our friendship to the folk music that we heard growing up and to our more recent musical adventures in Canada and the U.S.</p><p>Our project is nearly complete but we need your support to get it off the ground. Your contribution will help us put the finishing touches on the recording, including art work, pressing, manufacturing and purchasing rights. It will fund the promotion of the CD and will also enable us to pay off some of the money we have already used towards the musicians' honorariums, travel expenses and the commission of a new piece. Any extra contributions will be used towards our other ongoing projects, </p><p></p><p><b>Details</b></p><p>Most of the music featured on this CD has never been recorded before, including Exequiel Mantega's arrangement of Piazzolla's famous Tango Etudes for two flutes, our own arrangement of the ""Aria"" from Villa-Lobos' Bachianas Brasileira No. 6 for flute and bass flute and the fiery ""Danzas del Fuego"" for two flutes, cello and marimba written for us by Greek-Canadian composer Constantine Caravassilis.</p><p></p><p>We are proud to present Running the Edge for two flutes and percussive piano by Jennifer Higdon, one of the most frequently performed American composers of our time. Last, but not least, Franz Doppler's well known ""Duettino on Hungarian Motives"" gives us the chance to offer our interpretation on a much loved classic for two flutes and piano. </p><p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">About us</b><br/></p><p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431293314/obedke5rdq1njnfrcffg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><b></b></p><p>We are a flute duo based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

breathing and even more gratifying than playing alone. Our collaboration began in 2010 with performances in each other's graduating recitals and has since then taken us to various venues and chamber music series in the Toronto area.

They facilitate growth. They expand to support and nurture. Our diverse roots converge on this CD, bringing together the music of Hungarian, Latin American and North American composers. This recording offers a delectable variety of music from the W.F. Bach Duo Sonata that became the root of our friendship to the folk music that we heard growing up and to our more recent musical adventures in Canada and the U.S.Our project is nearly complete but we need your support to get it off the ground. Your contribution will help us put the finishing touches on the recording, including art work, pressing, manufacturing and purchasing rights. It will fund the promotion of the CD and will also enable us to pay off some of the money we have already used towards the musicians' honorariums, travel expenses and the commission of a new piece. Any extra contributions will be used towards our other ongoing projects, DetailsMost of the music featured on this CD has never been recorded before, including Exequiel Mantega's arrangement of Piazzolla's famous Tango Etudes for two flutes, our own arrangement of the ""Aria"" from Villa-Lobos' Bachianas Brasileira No. 6 for flute and bass flute and the fiery ""Danzas del Fuego"" for two flutes, cello and marimba written for us by Greek-Canadian composer Constantine Caravassilis.We are proud to present Running the Edge for two flutes and percussive piano by Jennifer Higdon, one of the most frequently performed American composers of our time. Last, but not least, Franz Doppler's well known ""Duettino on Hungarian Motives"" gives us the chance to offer our interpretation on a much loved classic for two flutes and piano. About usWe are a flute duo based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Though born on
different continents and trained in different countries, we have forged a personal and musical connection that makes playing together as natural and effortless as
breathing and even more gratifying than playing alone. Our collaboration began in 2010 with performances in each other's graduating recitals and has since then taken us to various venues and chamber music series in the Toronto area. We are looking forward to an exciting new season with appearances in Toronto, the University of Idaho, New York and Monterrey, Mexico. Our visionProfessional flute duos aren't very common and the existing repertoire can quickly be exhausted. This presents a wonderful opportunity for us to influence the creation of new repertoire. Our goal is to keep commissioning exciting new music from young composers. This CD will enable us to apply for grants that will help fund such future projects. General Budget OutlineArtist's Honorariums: $3000Graphic Design: $1000Marketing Expenses: $2000Travel Expenses: $2000Production and Manufacturing: $2000AcknowledgementsWe could not have come this far without the artistic contributions of our musical team, including pianists Chad Spears and Oszkár Morzsa, marimba player Michelle Colton, cellist Amahl Arulanandam and composer Constantine Caravassilis. Our heartfelt thanks to our technical team: our sound engineer Peter Olsen, our videographer, Alison J.

<h3>Why Another Rock Album?</h3>
<h1></h1>It has been argued that rock is dead, and the world certainly doesn't need another record that doesn't sell to prove the point.  However, I thought I was making the first album, Fighting Through February, as a personal catharsis.  Then, after putting it out there, I started getting messages.  ""So Much really moved me because I just lost my spouse....""  ""Impossible really inspired me to not make people feel like that.""  ""Who I Am really helped me come to grips with my addiction....I think I can beat it this time!""  ""I was moved to tears when I heard.....""   ""It was good to hear that I'm not alone.""  ""I think maybe we all need to hear this, because it speaks to everyone's broken condition....""<br/><br/>So, I'm making this because I believe in three things:<br/><br/><ul>
<li><b>All of us are wrestling through something.</b></li>
<li><b>All of us have been conditioned to pretend we're not.</b></li>
<li><b>Music is cathartic and acknowledging our brokenness won't make us whole, but it will help us through.</b></li>

Why Another Rock Album?
It has been argued that rock is dead, and the world certainly doesn't need another record that doesn't sell to prove the point.  However, I thought I was making the first album, Fighting Through February, as a personal catharsis.  Then, after putting it out there, I started getting messages.  ""So Much really moved me because I just lost my spouse....""  ""Impossible really inspired me to not make people feel like that.""  ""Who I Am really helped me come to grips with my addiction....I think I can beat it this time!""  ""I was moved to tears when I heard.....""   ""It was good to hear that I'm not alone.""  ""I think maybe we all need to hear this, because it speaks to everyone's broken condition....""So, I'm making this because I believe in three things:
All of us are wrestling through something.
All of us have been conditioned to pretend we're not.
Music is cathartic and acknowledging our brokenness won't make us whole, but it will help us through.


  So Didn't ""Fighting Through February"" Cover It?
 No.  The truth is I started out Fighting Through February with 21 songs, thinned it to 12, and have written a good bit on the topic of heartache and loss since then.  There are still pretty good odds that for someone, the disease isn't going to go away.  For someone, the spouse is.  For someone the addiction isn't going to go away.  For someone, the job is.I believe that the healing that came from ""Fighting Through February"" can continue, and the beautiful thing about ""You Can Call Me Alan"" (spoiler alert) is that FTF was about me, but ""You Can Call Me Alan"" is going to invite everyone to acknowledge that they are Alan Smythy.

 Marketing so the record can reach even more people.
If the funding goes to around $5,000, we will move the tracking of vocals and guitars to Greenjeans Studios in Wellington, KS, under the expertise of Carter Green, and that will make a HUGE difference in the quality of the record.    
The Impact The truth?  We're doing this record with or without the funding, but with funding, it will be better...better for you to listen to, and better to share with your friends who might be going through rough times (because, surely YOU aren't!)  
The world doesn't need another rock album, but it does need to know that pain is ok and part of the human experience.

 
The first record was not marketed at all, and still made an impact on many people.  Really doing this right can make even a bigger impact.

 Make this really good art will build trust for those who are skeptical when listening just because we're unknowns.    
Risks & Challenges  When I went to start this campaign, they had pointers on what to say in each section, and the pointer for this section was, ""People value your transparency"".  I'll change that to ""People need transparency.""  Putting art of any kind out there is risky, but especially art that explores the pain and heartache of humanity.  And the truth is, with the first album having been compared to ""Sgt.

In the last few years, we have been putting every cent towards buying equipment, so we could finally be able to record ourselves professionally. In 2012, after our first album, we were taken on by a music label. We were excited and highly motivated by the possibility of professional musical careers. After months of investing time, money, hard work and hope, we realized that our ex-label was not fulfilling its promised terms. Because of our agreement with them, however, we lost our copyrights and name... </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">But we didn't let that stop us. We founded a new band this year, ""HolidayPark,"" Now we live for the music again, and this time we won't give up the copyrights to any label, let alone our name! But this means that we must take on a lot of risk. By working together and giving it everything we had, we were able to finish our first single, ""Heartbeat,"" Starting on the third of July, our promotional CDs will be distributed to nearly all radio stations in Germany. </p>

</h4>
<p>Mike was born in Tuebingen, Germany in 1987. After graduating he started making small film- and music projects. When he was 18, he traveled through Australia for a year and a half but then had to go back to Germany for his military service. As a soldier in Afghanistan in 2009, he made his first documentary ""In Action."" Afterwards, he volunteered for 18 months for the peace project ""Cinema Jenin"" in Palestine. In this context he taught film and film editing in the university of Jenin. Subsequently, he was involved as director and art director in several films. His first documentary film, ""The Court,"" made its way to the cinemas in 2013. Since May of 2015, his current project, ‘The Forecaster,’ has been in theaters, and his new film, ""The Promise,"" will follow in spring of 2016.</p>
<p>Since he was eight, Mike has been interested in music. He plays piano, the drums, violin and guitar. Bands like ""Fools Garden,"" ""Lou Bega"" and ""Hermes House Band"" have inspired him and made music his biggest passion. He started to produce digital music very early. Known as ""Psychogate,"" he was involved in the Goa scene and later went by the name ""LittleBigTalent"" at House parties. He founded his first pop band ""I AM"" in 2012 and is now active as a producer and musician for ""HolidayPark.""</p>

</h4>
<p></p>
<p>In 1995 Kiko was born in the Portuguese town Viseu. When he was two years old, he moved to Germany with his mother because his father already worked there. During school he earned some money through part time jobs and afterwards worked as a waiter. Even though Kiko's mother was a singer in Portugal, he first discovered music through the ""Emo"" scene. He was a big fan of ""Avenged Sevenfold,"" ""Bullet For My Valentine"" and ""RED,"" but now works primarily with pop music.</p>
<p>In spring of 2013, he met Mike who discovered his singing talent and made him a member of ""I AM"". Afterwards, they worked on several musical projects before founding ""HolidayPark"" with Franci in 2015.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Franci was born in August of 1987 in Hechingen, Germany. She worked in her parent‘s pizzeria for several years as well as working as a hair stylist.</p>
<p>When she was young, she got into music and began training her voice beyond the shower. She was inspired by artists like the ""Fugees,"" ""Rihanna"" and ""Adele"" and, in 2013, she was a contestant on Germany's largest singing competition series.</p>
<p>In March of 2015, Franci met Mike and Kiko who encouraged her to sing again. Together they founded ""HolidayPark.""</p>

 ENGLISH

Summer, sun, happiness! Here at ""HolidayPark,"" we love making pop music and ballads that are fun and upbeat! We just finished our first single, ""Heartbeat,"" and now must complete our album of the same name! But to do so, we need your help! 



Music has always been our greatest passion. In the last few years, we have been putting every cent towards buying equipment, so we could finally be able to record ourselves professionally. In 2012, after our first album, we were taken on by a music label. We were excited and highly motivated by the possibility of professional musical careers. After months of investing time, money, hard work and hope, we realized that our ex-label was not fulfilling its promised terms. Because of our agreement with them, however, we lost our copyrights and name... 
But we didn't let that stop us. We founded a new band this year, ""HolidayPark,"" Now we live for the music again, and this time we won't give up the copyrights to any label, let alone our name! But this means that we must take on a lot of risk. By working together and giving it everything we had, we were able to finish our first single, ""Heartbeat,"" Starting on the third of July, our promotional CDs will be distributed to nearly all radio stations in Germany. 
Follow the link below to listen to our single, ""Heartbeat,"" so you can hear our music for yourself.
https://soundcloud.com/little-big-talent/sets/s...

And of course this is our first music video!


Now we are working on our debut album, which we hope to release in the fall of 2015. But to finish it and create another music video for our song ""Broken Down"" (see link above), we need money. More money than we can invest ourselves. Although we produce the videos ourselves and work with our own dance company, creating professional videos and records is still very expensive. 
That's where you come in. Please support or share our campaign, so we can keep working independently and bring the summer into your home, and maybe you will soon be able to hear our music at parties all over the world! With your help we can make a new start!
Also, check out our perks! We have some great stuff for you!
Just have a listen, and enjoy the summer! 

This is what we need it for:
10 recording days á $350 per day:           $3500
Mastering professionally:                             $1750
Cover Design:                                                   $100
CD Print 2000 pcs:                                         $3000
Music video production:                               $5000
Live Equipment (PA, MIXER and MICS): $1500
Kahon Drum:                                                     $150

Thank you very much for your support!



The Band

""Mike aka LittleBigTalent"" (Michele Gentile)                      

Mike was born in Tuebingen, Germany in 1987. After graduating he started making small film- and music projects. When he was 18, he traveled through Australia for a year and a half but then had to go back to Germany for his military service. As a soldier in Afghanistan in 2009, he made his first documentary ""In Action."" Afterwards, he volunteered for 18 months for the peace project ""Cinema Jenin"" in Palestine. In this context he taught film and film editing in the university of Jenin. Subsequently, he was involved as director and art director in several films. His first documentary film, ""The Court,"" made its way to the cinemas in 2013. Since May of 2015, his current project, ‘The Forecaster,’ has been in theaters, and his new film, ""The Promise,"" will follow in spring of 2016.
Since he was eight, Mike has been interested in music. He plays piano, the drums, violin and guitar. Bands like ""Fools Garden,"" ""Lou Bega"" and ""Hermes House Band"" have inspired him and made music his biggest passion. He started to produce digital music very early. Known as ""Psychogate,"" he was involved in the Goa scene and later went by the name ""LittleBigTalent"" at House parties. He founded his first pop band ""I AM"" in 2012 and is now active as a producer and musician for ""HolidayPark.""

""Kiko"" (Francisco Barata)                                                         


In 1995 Kiko was born in the Portuguese town Viseu. When he was two years old, he moved to Germany with his mother because his father already worked there. During school he earned some money through part time jobs and afterwards worked as a waiter. Even though Kiko's mother was a singer in Portugal, he first discovered music through the ""Emo"" scene. He was a big fan of ""Avenged Sevenfold,"" ""Bullet For My Valentine"" and ""RED,"" but now works primarily with pop music.
In spring of 2013, he met Mike who discovered his singing talent and made him a member of ""I AM"". Afterwards, they worked on several musical projects before founding ""HolidayPark"" with Franci in 2015.

""Franci"" (Francesca Tummarello)                                           

Franci was born in August of 1987 in Hechingen, Germany. She worked in her parent‘s pizzeria for several years as well as working as a hair stylist.
When she was young, she got into music and began training her voice beyond the shower. She was inspired by artists like the ""Fugees,"" ""Rihanna"" and ""Adele"" and, in 2013, she was a contestant on Germany's largest singing competition series.
In March of 2015, Franci met Mike and Kiko who encouraged her to sing again. Together they founded ""HolidayPark.""


 DEUTSCHSommer, Sonne, gute Laune! Wir von HolidayPark lieben und produzieren Pop- und Balladenmusik die ins Ohr geht und im Kopf bleibt! Nach unserer Single ""Heartbeat"" muss jetzt unser gleichnamiges Album fertig werden! Doch dafür brauchen wir Eure Hilfe!

Musik war schon immer unsere größte Leidenschaft. Die letzten Jahre haben wir jeden Cent zusammen gekratzt, um unser erstes Equipment kaufen zu können, damit wir endlich professionellere Aufnahmen anfertigen konnten. Mit unserem ersten Album erreichten wir 2012 schliesslich ein Label. Überglücklich und mit höchster Motivation sahen wir dem Start unserer musikalischen Laufbahn entgegen. Doch nach Monaten harter Arbeit, Investitionen und Gutglauben wurden wir von unserem damaligem Label hintergangen. Da wir vertraglich gebunden waren, verloren wir alle Rechte und unseren Namen... 

Doch wir gaben nicht auf und gründeten dieses Jahr unsere neue Band: HolidayPark. Jetzt leben wir wieder für die Musik. Und diesmal geben wir keinem Label unsere Rechte ab, geschweige denn unseren Namen! Doch das bedeutet Eigenfinanzierung und Selbstrisiko. Mit vereinten Kräften und allem, was wir aufbringen konnten, haben wir es nun geschafft, unsere erste Single ""Heartbeat"" auf den Weg in die Radios zu bringen. Ab dem 3. Juli 2015 gehen die ersten Promotion CDs an fast alle Radiosender in Deutschland raus.
Damit Ihr auch mal einen Eindruck bekommen könnt, wie wir uns eigentlich anhören, hier die Tracks zu unserem Single Album ""Heartbeat"":https://soundcloud.com/little-big-talent/sets/single-heartbeat-1Und natürlich gibt's hier unser Musikvideo:Doch jetzt arbeiten wir an unserem Debütalbum, das wir im Herbst 2015 veröffentlichen wollen. Allerdings brauchen wir Geld, um es fertigzustellen und ein zweites Musikvideo zu unserem Song ""Broken Down"" (siehe Demos) produzieren zu können. Mehr Geld, als wir selber noch investieren können, denn auch wenn wir unsere Musikvideos selbst produzieren und mit unserer eigenen Choreotanztruppe zusammen arbeiten, sind die Videodrehs und profesionelle Aufnahmen leider sehr teuer.Und da kommt Ihr ins Spiel. Unterstützt oder teilt unsere Kampagne, damit wir weiterarbeiten können, unabhängig bleiben und Euch mit unserer Musik den Sommer ins Haus zaubern können. Vielleicht werdet Ihr schon bald unsere Musik auf Parties rund um den Globus hören können! Mit Eurer Hilfe schaffen wir diesen Neustart!Und werft doch auch mal einen Blick auf unsere Perks, wir haben cooles Zeug für Euch.Hört mal rein und genießt den Sommer!Dafür brauchen wir das Geld:10 Aufnahmetage á $350 pro Tag:           $3500Professionelles Mastering:                          $1750Cover Design:                                                   $100CD Pressung 2000 stk:                                $3000Musikvideo-Produktion:                               $5000Live Equipment (PA, MIXER und MICS): $1500Kahon Trommel:                                               $150Und vielen Dank Euch allen!

With the release of their first three records, KOVLO became
one of the most interesting and important Swiss post-rock and instrumental rock
bands. Today they are worldwide known and critically acclaimed. During their
European tours they played so far in Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark,
Italy, Czech Republic.

Would you like to be part of the project? We are making this campaign because first of all we want to make this record as best as we can. Secondly, we would also like to be able to promote it as best as we can.
If you support us, we will be able, for example, to release for the first time a record on vinyl, and not only on CD. We would also be able to do a good promotion and make some cool videos.

  What We Need

The costs for making the record: around 4000 dollars. 
For the Vinyl: around 1500 dollars.
For the CD: around 1000 dollars.
For making a video: around 1000 dollars.
For a good promotion: at least 1000 dollars.
We will release the record in any case, but if you support us, we can do it much better and we can do much more. 
This means that even if we don't reach the goal, in any case we will be able to use the money we will raise and make the best out of it!

<h3> </h3>
<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>So here's my story. I live in Beit Shemesh which is a medium-sized town tucked away in the hills of Jerusalem, I'm originally from Montreal, Canada. My life here is pretty sweet. I adore my wife and family. I take time to enjoy exercise, nature and watching my kids grow up. I'm trying to grow myself too, every day, mainly through the teachings of Chassidut (chassidic philosophy on life). </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535984455/psnnzyfuraail3yy6oom.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Getting Serious </h3>
<p>All this is fairly blessed and typical, but the music, well, is a bit out of the ordinary. While I've always been involved in making and sharing music in some capacity (playing drums in rock bands, entertaining with my guitar and <i>niggunim</i> in shuls, camp, and schools, humming and recording original tunes into my phone etc...), I first hit play in a real recording studio and cut a few of my own tracks about 18 months ago.</p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Here's one of the best things that came out of those early sessions. It's a heavy rock song called  </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8ezpByH_2k"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style='background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>CLOSER</a><font> and it's based on a verse from the book Devarim (Deuteronomy) as well as an experience I had traveling to Rashb""I/Meron on Lag b'Omer:</font></p>
<p> </p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/R8ezpByH_2k?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p>And here's the <a href=""https://beinoni.bandcamp.com/releases"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">whole collection of songs</a> I made last year. </p>
<p>It includes a real barn-burner about traveling to Uman that's gotten a lot of attention and much is much beloved (or loathed<i> - the message, not the music -</i> depending on your point of view). </p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/IRrhwDhs1RU?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div> </div>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Yes, it's been a wild year and a half. Starts and stalls. More recording, some live performances - most recently at the Klezmer Festival in Safed, lots of praying, learning and improving. With every new song, I feel like I'm honing my musical voice and getting closer (no pun intended) to the artist I could be. </span></p>
<p><i>Why did I start recording, why am I doing this?</i></p>
<p>The short answer is this: I always had this burning desire to make music but there were always so many obstacles, both self-imposed and others, standing in my way -  and this lasted <i>for years</i>. Then, after an epic journey to Uman for Rosh Hashana, as if by some mystical magic, my deepened connection to R. Nachman and other great Holy Men, <i>tzadikim, gave me the courage to <strong>just go for it.</strong> </i></p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Getting Seriouser </span></p>
</div><div>
<p>And now,  I'm ready to take the next step! </p>
<p>Which is recording and promoting a new 5 song EP. I've already written a lot of it. The songs are sounding pretty awesome so far - a serious cut above what I've already done. Some of the track titles are:</p>
<p>""Patience""</p>
<p>""Bigger man""</p>
<p>""Direction Up""</p>
<p>The first demo track is already out in the world, you can hear it, it'called '<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfvBrDY1hB4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Deepest Moments</a>.'</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/JfvBrDY1hB4?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p>A lot of people have given me great feedback on this one and it isn't even finished yet. It needs polishing, more guitar riffage and beats!!! Disclaimer:: I think it'll probably be one of the mellower track on the album. </p>
<p>Overall, I want to blend an easy listening style with a bit of edginess and aggression - think 311 and Linkin Park mixed with the Beastie Boys, mixed with Ed Sheeran and with just a smattering of Matisyahu.</p>
<p>I'm almost there.</p>

</div></div>","My Story
So here's my story. I live in Beit Shemesh which is a medium-sized town tucked away in the hills of Jerusalem, I'm originally from Montreal, Canada. My life here is pretty sweet. I adore my wife and family. I take time to enjoy exercise, nature and watching my kids grow up. I'm trying to grow myself too, every day, mainly through the teachings of Chassidut (chassidic philosophy on life). 

 
Getting Serious 
All this is fairly blessed and typical, but the music, well, is a bit out of the ordinary. While I've always been involved in making and sharing music in some capacity (playing drums in rock bands, entertaining with my guitar and niggunim in shuls, camp, and schools, humming and recording original tunes into my phone etc...), I first hit play in a real recording studio and cut a few of my own tracks about 18 months ago.
Here's one of the best things that came out of those early sessions. It's a heavy rock song called  CLOSER and it's based on a verse from the book Devarim (Deuteronomy) as well as an experience I had traveling to Rashb""I/Meron on Lag b'Omer:
 

 
And here's the whole collection of songs I made last year. 
It includes a real barn-burner about traveling to Uman that's gotten a lot of attention and much is much beloved (or loathed - the message, not the music - depending on your point of view). 

 
Yes, it's been a wild year and a half. Starts and stalls. More recording, some live performances - most recently at the Klezmer Festival in Safed, lots of praying, learning and improving. With every new song, I feel like I'm honing my musical voice and getting closer (no pun intended) to the artist I could be. 
Why did I start recording, why am I doing this?
The short answer is this: I always had this burning desire to make music but there were always so many obstacles, both self-imposed and others, standing in my way -  and this lasted for years. Then, after an epic journey to Uman for Rosh Hashana, as if by some mystical magic, my deepened connection to R. Nachman and other great Holy Men, tzadikim, gave me the courage to just go for it. 
Getting Seriouser 

And now,  I'm ready to take the next step! 
Which is recording and promoting a new 5 song EP. I've already written a lot of it. The songs are sounding pretty awesome so far - a serious cut above what I've already done. Some of the track titles are:
""Patience""
""Bigger man""
""Direction Up""
The first demo track is already out in the world, you can hear it, it'called 'Deepest Moments.'

 
A lot of people have given me great feedback on this one and it isn't even finished yet. It needs polishing, more guitar riffage and beats!!! Disclaimer:: I think it'll probably be one of the mellower track on the album. 
Overall, I want to blend an easy listening style with a bit of edginess and aggression - think 311 and Linkin Park mixed with the Beastie Boys, mixed with Ed Sheeran and with just a smattering of Matisyahu.
I'm almost there.
What's next?
To make a long story short and without going into all the technical details -  To fulfill this dream of producing the phattest, dopest, illest sounding new Jewish music this side of the Mediterranean, right here in local studios in Beit Shemesh will require your kind assistance. 
Yes, I get by with a little help from my friends.  
What your hard-earned money will go towards: 
- MORE STUDIO TIME Approximately 50 hours should do it. Including recording editing/production work, and mastering. And no fancy Tel Aviv. It's all homegrown and cooked right here in Beit Shemesh - who would have thunk!?
- GEEEAARRRR I need some new gear like an electric guitar for recording, a drum-pad and keyboard for making beats. I need to hit the road on many a performance so the gear will come in handy for these musical escapades. 
- PROMOTION The album has to be promoted to be heard, primarily through videos, Facebook and Instagram ads. 
Idealism
Do I have idealistic goals that transcend the music or that I somehow want the music to be a channel for?
Yes
and....
No. 
I would like us to all be more unified, here in Israel and around the world. I LOVE that so many different kinds of people get excited about my music - young and old religious or not - who cares!? The right music is a unifying force for good!
I have a deep desire to make meaningful connections with people of every age, background, races, color, and creed. 
 Music is a fantastic way for me to pursue this desire. I want us all to part together (in  a kosher way) right now...to create good vibes day and night, all the time. 
But at the end of the day, I'm just an artist. I have to be honest and say that, for me, creating music is an and end in of itself. 
If people enjoy it and come together around it, that's the gravy,
What happens if (yikes) I don't raise the $$$? 
Even if I don't raise all the money, I'll still make the record. I've gone this far independantly, and I won't quit - that part is up to me. 
The degree to which you'd like to make it easier for me -  is up to you : )

<h3>Nick Teehan</h3>
<p>I've been a musician all my life and a songwriter for 10 years. I'm trying to take things to a new depth with my most intimate and polished work. I've personally funded production on this album, a music video, t-shirts,  a songbook of original sheet music; all the stuff my fans have been asking for for years.  I have the tools and materials to have a truly successful release that can help elevate my work and bring it to a national and international audience, but I need your help to complete our mission.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need and What You Get:</h3>
<p>This release has called on every contact I have to get things done, and some of those fees have been deferred in anticipation of this crowdfunding campaign.  There are also upcoming costs including printing vinyl and producing merch, and promotion and publicity for the release. The break down is as follows: $3000 in outstanding production fees, $3000 in vinyl and CD printing, $2000 in publicity and promotion.<br/><br/>As incentives I've racked my brain and come up with the following incentives, available in a bunch of different configurations: downloads, CDs, Vinyl, T-Shirts, Songbooks, Ransom-style thank-you notess, made-to-order personal songs, post-cards from my cat, singing voice-mail telegrams, and personal watercolour portraits by Canadian watercolour artist Terra Hazelton (@terradawndoodles on insta)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My 2012 release <i>There is Not a Snake </i>had a great release show and some nice publicity, but <i>These Little Things</i> has a different set of goals.  I have always been able to reach the audience I'm exposed to. Your contributions will give my unique brand of music thousands of new ears across Canada, and I know you're going to love the exclusive access and advanced copies of my work. I've sold nearly every copy of my back-catalogue grinding out shows in my hometown, I can't wait to take this thing over the top with your help. The better this campaign goes, the more unique stuff I'll come up with to keep my fans entertained and delighted. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I'm doing a lot of weird perks. More than the average campaign. One reason is that I just came up with tons of good ideas, but another one is that I truly like being creative and unique. The prospect of at least one person using the singing telegram to deliver weird news was too much to pass up.  Some of these, like the paintings and the printed songbook, rely on deadlines that I won't have complete control over. I have no idea how many ransom notes people will want, but I would love to be challenged to do too many. The vinyl also won't be available by Christmas.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some of you won't have the funds or ability to help with my campaign, and that's cool. Others (I'm looking at you, McGee) have accidentally bought the same CD several times and we need to work on our trust.  <br/><br/>Here's what you can do to help out: share this stuff on social, sure, but more importantly tell your friends. Tell people about my old songs about mannequins and raccoons and dachshunds.  Tell them the story of this record, the winter cabin where I wrote and recorded it, the story about haunting my wife, and how to spell my last name T-E-E-H-A-N and how to pronounce it ""Tee-in"". <br/><br/>Your contributions make all the difference ""these little things"" are so important. Can't wait to see what you're all capable of.</p>

This is where I know how to target and reach an audience on all Social Media platforms....I just need the funding to run the advertising and make the music video.</p><p><strong>I will run a 6 week Social Media campaign, generating interest around the release of the song. I know who my target audience is and how to maximise this budget. I have ran campaigns before and in the past paid other companies to do it. The truth is, if I'd of spent the money on advertising myself, rather than pay these marketing companies, I would of seen much greater results. There is no one more qualified than me to run these campaigns. I have heavily invested time and money in to studying Facebook, Instagram, Spotify and YouTube.  I know how the algorithms, analytics and all the technical side to marketing works on these platforms. I may help other people do it too in the future! So Im asking you to fund me and I will work day and night getting the right people to hear my music. Please help me on this journey.</strong></p><p>I have been writing songs since the age of 8 and will never stop till the day I die.

I have invested my whole life in to my career and I really love what I do. I am hoping now you guys can be a part of this incredible journey too and help me generate enough money to help promote my new Single!I am looking to generate £6000 of funding to promote / advertise my new single on Facebook and Instagram. £4000 of the budget will be spent on these 2 platforms as they are the most effective when it comes to music marketing. I will spend £1000 on other sites such as YouTube, Twitter, Apple Music and Spotify. I will use £700 for the music video and£300 for merchandise after the release date. If I don't get the exact funding I need, then I will just use the money I do get from this campaign on advertising the single on Instagram and Facebook.If I can achieve the funding I require you would literally be the record label I don't have. All a label would do in todays market is mainly promote this song on Instagram and Facebook. Well I've took marketing courses and studied social medial for 4 years now so I don't need to pay anyone to do it. This is where I know how to target and reach an audience on all Social Media platforms....I just need the funding to run the advertising and make the music video.I will run a 6 week Social Media campaign, generating interest around the release of the song. I know who my target audience is and how to maximise this budget. I have ran campaigns before and in the past paid other companies to do it. The truth is, if I'd of spent the money on advertising myself, rather than pay these marketing companies, I would of seen much greater results. There is no one more qualified than me to run these campaigns. I have heavily invested time and money in to studying Facebook, Instagram, Spotify and YouTube.  I know how the algorithms, analytics and all the technical side to marketing works on these platforms. I may help other people do it too in the future! So Im asking you to fund me and I will work day and night getting the right people to hear my music. Please help me on this journey.I have been writing songs since the age of 8 and will never stop till the day I die. I am always challenging my art and striving to improve my writing skills. I really feel this is the best song I have written to date and I would love the world to hear it. I have been working with an amazing talented Producer called Ben Preston who helped me finish the music and produced the track and now we need your help to promote it!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a Chicago-based keyboardist, vocalist, producer, and songwriter. In the last 10 years, I have released three albums of original music as well as been featured on numerous recordings for other artists, some of which even won Grammys. I have also performed around the world with the likes of Gallant, Brett Dennen, Lupe Fiasco, The Heard, Naughty Professor, Hey Champ, and Hanging Hearts. </p>
<p>I began work on my new album, <i>Really Human</i>, in the fall of 2016. Not long after that, I reached out to one of my favorite artists, electro-soul legend <strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZvpIEvltUA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Georgia Anne Muldrow</a></strong>, to help produce a few of my songs. After she agreed to help, working with her quickly set the tone for this new album, as my songs were taken to new heights of electronic groove glory! While my touring schedule over the past few years slowed the album's progress somewhat, I was able to buckle down on a lot of the album's recording and mixing in the latter half of 2018.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Right now, the album is about <strong>95% complete</strong> and I released the first single and video, <strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-h9lHJrEtkk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""We Broke,""</a></strong> last summer to wide acclaim. And now I need your help — my friends, family, and fans — to release this exciting new project in the most effective way possible. As my most ambitious and personal project yet, I can't wait for the world to hear it.</p>

<h3>Why Vinyl?</h3>
<p>These days, a touring band's merchandise is one their most important revenue streams, especially on the road. Although CDs are certainly cheaper to print, people are buying fewer of them as CD players are becoming less and less common. Vinyl records, on the other hand, have been making a come back over the past decade. <a href=""https://www.visualcapitalist.com/music-industry-sales/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">In fact, they are the <i>only</i> physical format for music that has been increasing in sales over the last few years</a>.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1548460074/hknkvhrlimc73ahzqbez.jpg"" src=""""/><br/> </p>
<p>Listeners appreciate the higher sound quality of vinyl as well as their potential for becoming collector's items. And most new artists — myself included — also include a digital download card with the vinyl purchase, so the music can also be listened to digitally. If you're going to buy music in a physical format, you might as well buy the highest quality option while showing off your collection.</p>
<p>And, not to mention, I've always dreamed of releasing my music on a vinyl record.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Printing to vinyl is not only an expensive process but it can also be a very long one. With so few pressing plants in the US, their orders become backlogged quickly — orders can easily take between 3 to 5 months to be delivered. We will have to wait to release the album digitally until the records are printed, so planning an official release date could take longer than we hope. But if that is the case, that only gives us <i>more </i>time to prepare and to promote the album leading up to the release date, which is a good thing.</p>
</div><div>

<p>I appreciate you taking the time to read about my campaign and listen to my music. I totally understand if now is not the right time for you to make a monetary donation.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am Rachel Michelle Jackson and I am a singer/songwriter and speaker. My desire is to minister to people in a real and honest way. My prayer is that this music and the words that come forth will bring healing, deliverance, restoration, and salvation. I have been ministering through word and song for 17 years, reaching out to women, children, youth, and college-aged students. My past music received regular airplay on several radio stations across America. When this new EP is complete I have goals to reach people in that way again. I have lead worship in many settings from church camps to inside prison walls. I am youth pastors wife in Sand Springs, OK at Angus Church. Me and husband Jared have 3 kids together and have been married for 14 years.</p>
<ul>
<li>This project is very important to me because it reaches people and I love people.  Having new music that reaches this culture of today will open doors to hearts and relationships. </li>

</ul>
<p>Any time I have been lost in life, hurt or endured a tragic situation, I have always had music, writing and singing as something that brought healing to my heart.  So many of us turn to music to help us through good and bad times.  Music influences how we feel, think, and even what we beleive. I want to take all those times in my life, make something amazing that connects with people.</p>

I'm Jeremiah Cole. I was born and raised in Wilmington, DE, but have called NYC home for almost 20 years. I grew up performing and studying at arts institutions like Wilmington's Cab Calloway School of the Arts, the Philadelphia High School for Creative and Performing Arts, and later New York's American Musical and Dramatic Academy. I dropped out of college at the age of 19, signing my first management contract and recording my first demo. Major label meetings followed, but nothing panned out completely. 3 managers, a production deal, and several years later, here I am. Over the years I've had the pleasure of co-writing and recording countless songs, mostly unreleased, and performing at many venues. Under the name Jeremy Cole, I released my first official singles and videos in 2010 and 2011 respectively, ""Can't Crash"" and ""I Want Your Body"" while signed to a production deal. I've appeared on television in ""Showtime at the Apollo"" and ""The Voice"". I've also done guest vocals on house records, but I have NEVER released a completely cohesive project or anything, for that matter, that was completely independent and my own creative vision. I decided after a few years of inactivity, frustration, and depression to take matters into my own hands. But I can't do it all on my own. This is where you come in! Your support will not only help me record, mix, and master the project, but also promote, stream on all streaming platforms, and produce release parties and performances. I have been so inspired by the support many of you have given to me over the years. Keep it up! I need you now more than ever. No amount is too small. I decided on the title ""Reborn for the First Time"" because I've been at this thing for a long time, so it is a rebirth of sorts, but it's definitely the first time I'm doing it on my own terms. Much love and thanks always...</p><p>Jeremiah Cole</p></div>","Hey guys! I'm Jeremiah Cole. I was born and raised in Wilmington, DE, but have called NYC home for almost 20 years.

I dropped out of college at the age of 19, signing my first management contract and recording my first demo. Major label meetings followed, but nothing panned out completely. 3 managers, a production deal, and several years later, here I am. Over the years I've had the pleasure of co-writing and recording countless songs, mostly unreleased, and performing at many venues. Under the name Jeremy Cole, I released my first official singles and videos in 2010 and 2011 respectively, ""Can't Crash"" and ""I Want Your Body"" while signed to a production deal. I've appeared on television in ""Showtime at the Apollo"" and ""The Voice"". I've also done guest vocals on house records, but I have NEVER released a completely cohesive project or anything, for that matter, that was completely independent and my own creative vision. I decided after a few years of inactivity, frustration, and depression to take matters into my own hands. But I can't do it all on my own. This is where you come in! Your support will not only help me record, mix, and master the project, but also promote, stream on all streaming platforms, and produce release parties and performances. I have been so inspired by the support many of you have given to me over the years. Keep it up! I need you now more than ever. No amount is too small. I decided on the title ""Reborn for the First Time"" because I've been at this thing for a long time, so it is a rebirth of sorts, but it's definitely the first time I'm doing it on my own terms. Much love and thanks always...Jeremiah Cole",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Our journey, like many others is no different. It has ups and downs, peaks and valleys, struggles and celebrations. But what set me apart from the many is that I never gave up on fulfilling my dreams and my purpose, and now it’s time to give others the opportunity to do the same.</p>
<p>I grew up in a single mother household, the eldest of 4, living in Hackney. I found my love for music in my early teens and without question, I chose making beats in my bedroom over the street life that surrounded me.</p>
<p>Developing my skills as a producer, engineer and artist I began to build a name for myself, inviting many local artists to record their songs in my humble bedroom studio. This became a place where many aspiring artists and producers were able to hone and develop their skills.</p>
<p>Fast forward 15 years later, after achieving awards, sold out concerts and tours, travelling the world and collaborating with many of the UK’s profilic artists....VixMix Studios is born. </p>
<p>A place where all calibre of creatives can share common ground... creativity.</p>
<p>Whether it's your first time in a studio or you’ve had years of experience, VixMix Studios is committed to being a major part of your artistic growth and helping to establish your identity.</p>
<p>We’ve worked with everyone, from your everyday up and coming local artist, to your favourite A-list celebrities. We have a part to play in the process of their creativity.</p>
<p>We are launching our second studio room, double the size of our first and we want you to be part of the entire process, from conception to birth and onwards.</p>
<p>This is an opportunity for you to be part of something that could elevate your dreams or the dreams of others.</p>

<h3>Art Chakra is Touring through Europe and India!</h3>
<p>The members of Art Chakra, Roland Ramos and Diana Lovrin, are cultural ambassadors that create and hold space for creativity to thrive. </p>
<p>Our mission is to introduce our culture of high vibrational music and songwriting process with cultures different than our own to intermingle and enrich minds, music and artistry of all parties involved. </p>
<p>Art Chakra was born out of conversations between friends that were transformed into songs as a means of processing existential matters leading to catharsis and release, acting as a mirror for self reflection.</p>
<p>The beauty of our music lies in its simplicity and honesty: In a world of production-heavy, midi-driven electronic music - (though we can get down to that too!!!), Art Chakra is reminiscent of how an acoustic guitar and harmonies can touch you at a deep level.</p>
<p>In addition to Art Chakra, Roland is the creator of Artifications: a web-based documentary spotlighting the Art Scene world-wide, and runs the Artifications Art Gallery in Brooklyn NY. </p>
<p>Diana's other pursuits include: Dance as Medicine, DJing, and self empowerment through various Healing Arts modalities. </p>
<p>Both Roland and Diana host open mics (and other creative spaces) and understand the importance and the healing powers of creative sharing.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey y'all! I'm <strong>Dre Peace</strong>. An indie-soul artist with an avant garde style that will spark joy in your spirit. I have graced stages all over this country; starting when I was a small child. Ranging from Disney, Gap Inc., Canton Blues Fest, Kentucky Derby, NASCAR to professional athletic events and government celebrations locally and nationally. One half of the phenomenal duo, <strong>The Tryangles</strong>, my roots are in rock, jazz and alternative music. With vocal ability, a theatrical performance style and overall artistic expression; I create a beautiful experience that no one can miss.</p>
<p>Having worked a lifetime already to achieve my dreams, the past few months have been trying. I continued to TRY. Never giving up. Fueled by my need to simply experience more, I left. Leaving nearly everything where it was, I took myself. With only one goal in mind, and no distractions; The Grammys already feel familiar. To celebrate that momentum, I created <strong>The Details Tour</strong>. Naming it simply because I don't have all the details yet! However, I have the vision, drive and talent. I needed to create space for the opportunities to present themselves; and they did.</p>
<p>Now, with a target of 20 shows in 18 cities, I've identified the areas with whom I'd like to first share my eclectic sound in a series of intimate performances.  While I understand that this mostly, self funded initiative is unconventional - I have no big company behind me. With your support in mind, I am asking for YOUR help. If you’ve experienced any show, concert or performance of mine, you understand! I want to spread that same light with my voice throughout the country.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>There are several sponsorship tiers with merchandise gifts ranging from albums to private concerts! All this to show my appreciation of your donation to this campaign. Please review the perks to the right, and select a level that stands out to you.</p>
<p>Every patron of levels 2-4 will receive a copy of my debut EP; <strong>Half &amp; Half</strong>. I understand this is not a conventional way of releasing an album. It needed to be more personal. This musical work of art deserves more than a digital download. With the help of Brandon Scott, Mike Early, Rob Riley, Storm9000, Daniel Moss and Cece Beckham, we are finally ready to share this art with the world. I carefully wrote every song, Bjazz perfectly marrying the sounds to lyrics. </p>
<p>Each album is hand-painted, uniquely titled, numbered and original. A stunning, handcrafted piece of art to be both audibly and visually enjoyed.  I'm in the process of making two hundred of these albums. With nearly 120/200 complete, several have already been accounted for. Purchased albums will be viewable by the public for 24 hours before being removed and shipped.</p>

<p>If you don't know me (extra thanks for being here!), I'm a solo music artist based in NYC. Writing music and performing have been the focus of everything I've done, everywhere I've been, and everywhere I'm going. I am a passionate storyteller, in love with the vulnerability it requires and the connections it creates! Sharing my music with my community, friends and listeners has always been my highest joy and ultimate dream. </p>
<p>A few years ago, I funded and released a full-length album. Since then, my writing has evolved into a VERY different, entirely new sound, and I am bursting with excitement to share this new music with you!</p>
<p>I'm thrilled to start working on a four-song EP with an unbelievably talented producer and team here in Harlem. And this is where I need your help!</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The EP will include four tracks, and while I bring the song and my performance to the studio, it's my producer's job to actually capture my vision and create the musical experience for you all! This means my producer will be recording me, arranging and playing any additional instrument (bass, guitar, violin, cello, drums, synth, piano... this guy truly does it all), spending hours perfectly curating each sound to meet my vision, and sending on to his team for additional mixing and mastering for the finished track.</p>
<p>This is <strong>hundreds</strong> of hours of work, and I certainly want the entire team to be paid for their time, talents, and dedication. </p>
<p>For your help making this music happen, you will receive some ~super cool~ perks in addition to my eternal gratitude! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Crystal Perks</h3>
<p>Some donations will include a very special perk personally made by moi. An artist through and through, I also run a hand-made jewelry business where I create pendants, earrings, and out of crystals and semi-precious stones! With your donation, I will send along a crystal pendant to wear, hang on your wall or rear-view mirror, give to a friend - whatever your crystal needs may be.</p>
<p>Other perks involve hand-written, personalized poems and playlists, recordings of unreleased songs, private shows, and more. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

Instagram, Facebook, anywhere you scroll. Stream my music, share with your friends. Your support means the world. </p></div></div>","Sharing my Music
