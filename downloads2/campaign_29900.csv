<p>WHO: Planet Namaste - We are a group of yoga instructors and school educators who envision supporting and educating our communities and schools on the wellness factor of yoga.</p>
<p>WHAT: Onsite Yoga instruction for local schools. Curriculum is aligned with National PE and health standards, in addition to be an approved Social Emotional curriculum by CASEL. ﻿</p>
<ul>
<li>$400 provides one month(4 sessions) of Bring Your Teacher to Lunch Yoga. </li>
<li>$500 provides one month (4 sessions) of yoga specifically for teachers at their site. </li>
<li>$1000 provides 3 months(12 sessions) of an onsite YogaClub designed to be held before or after school and includes students, teachers, staff, and parents. This program is suggested as an alternative to detention. </li>
<li>$2000 provides an 8 hour professional development workshop for up to 6 school teachers on how to incorporate yoga (and chair yoga) into their daily curriculum. </li>
</ul>
<p>There are 17 schools in the Burbank Unified School District. We hope to raise enough money to provide one of our programs to each site.</p>
<p>WHY: The statistics are sobering. Half of all serious adult psychiatric illnesses – including major depression, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse – start by 14 years of age. Three-fourths of them are present by 25 years of age. (ActiveMinds.org) Anorexia is the leading cause of death among women ages 14-24.

<p><br/>Yoga is 5,000 year old Eastern discipline that integrates the mind, body, and inner resource. Yoga is becoming more mainstream in the West and starting to be honored for its wisdom in healing and nurturing the whole person.<br/><br/>Planet Namaste’s vision is to create a space that is inclusive of all body types and all ability levels. Our hope is to provide classes that will contribute to the healing and nurturing of every individual. We want to provide support to those who are in various stages of healing and recovery, in addition to those who are at differing levels of physical abilities.<br/><br/>Our business structure has three main components: community, education, and advocacy. Planet Namaste honors the tradition of yoga being a community focused practice. It’s not just what we learn on the mat, it’s also what we take from the mat and spread to the community. With this mind, Planet Namaste is involved in extensive community outreach. Our main target is our local neighborhoods. Other community targets include chiropractors, schools, physical therapists, our local hospital, and various rehab and recovery centers, including eating disorder programs. Planet Namaste also reaches out to other yoga centers, schools, and health centers. We are currently creating a community Health and Wellness Alliance, made up of local business owners that work directly in the wellness industry, where we combine our strengths to provide education to our neighbors, hold Wellness Workshops, and be a source of support.<br/><br/>Another component is education. We currently provide classes for kids from pre-k to 12th grade. The classes focus on the physical and emotional development of the various age groups with the intention of increasing focus, self-awareness, self-control, self-esteem, and body positive thinking. The non-competitive environment encourages students to start where they are, no matter where that is. Additionally, we are working on  a comprehensive, cross-disciplinary curriculum that meets National standards in health, PE, and social emotional learning. This curriculum would also incorporate life skills including empathy, resiliency, and empowerment. <br/><br/>Lastly, our third component is mental health advocacy. We would like to raise awareness and acceptance about mental wellness and how yoga can support those that struggle with anxiety, stress, eating disorders, and other disabilities. </p>

</div></div>","Envision a world with a small gap between urban and rural communities...This means quality education, less brain-drain or emigration of talented individuals who could play an active role in their community development, and more productivity and heritage preservation. This is what inspires us to champion the Educate Future Authors project in Zambia.


I am Nelson David Bassey, a third year BEng (Hons) Mechanical Engineering student at INTI International University in Malaysia, part of the Laureate network. I am also a managing director (Asia) of the Stella Project Ltd, a Zambian registered not-for-profit company.  Educate Future Authors is one of our stellar projects.
We believe that one of the best ways to narrow this rural-urban gap is by creating access to quality education. And quality education begins with access to quality educational resources and infrastructures – much of what is lacking in many rural communities in Zambia today. Our mission is to identify such communities and work towards providing the resources they need to provide quality education to children and youth.



United Nations statistics show that over 58 million children in the world do not have access to education, with a majority in sub-Saharan Africa. We want to be a part of the movement to close that gap as quickly as possible.


Your Contributions Will Help Us Complete Phase 1


Your contributions will help us complete Phase 1 (Identify & Measure) of the three project phases below, and establish the relationships needed to begin Phase 2 and Phase 3.



What We Need







Should the entire goal not be reached, the funds given will be distributed accordingly and travel dates adjusted according to the funds available. 


Should the goal be exceeded, every other donated fund will be channeled to the first center which we will be equipping.


Should the actual trip expense fall short of the amount donated, the remaining funds will be channeled toward the first center which we will be equipping (Kalulushi Municipal Council Library).



   The Impact 


The Stella Projects are creating access to quality education and resources, equipping youth to play an active role in the socio-economic development of their communities, and reducing crime rates and preventable diseases through knowledge empowerment.
A key aspect of our business model and approach is to:



Garner support for local businesses and organizations


Create opportunities for youths to make a difference in their communities


Create space for other innovative projects to take place in communities.


Reduce the migration of talent from the community for better education opportunities.

Cultivate local talent, ideas and intelligence.

   
Risks & Challenges
One of the risks we face is not being as fruitful in terms of meeting with prospective partners, as a result of visiting in December, a festive period of the year, and being there for only 7 days. The visiting season poses another challenge as movement may be limited due to rain and mud slides which may result in inefficiency.

To solve these challenges, we will reach out to prospective partners one month in advance to set up appointments on the dates we will be there. Also, being an African who grew up in Nigeria, I have lived in similar weather conditions, so adapting might not be much of a trouble. However, resorting to use a rented car minimizes the risk of inefficiency.

<div>As you may or may not know, College Students are not always rolling in the cash, therefore buying stickers, or campaign supplies in bulk is usually not an option for them.  This is why we want to help them!!</div>
<div>We are huge Bernie supporters and are active in a grassroots campaign in Asheville, North Carolina and the surrounding area.  After a an event called Bernie Bash we put on here, we had a few thousand stickers left over after using the funds we raised at the event.  We wanted these stickers to go to the people who needed them most.  <br/><br/>Then we started to think big, as Bernie often suggests.  We understand that with the right vision and the help from fellow supporters, that this grassroots efforts can be funded by the PEOPLE, by Bernie supporters, and that we can get tens of thousands of stickers or more to campuses across the country.  Our Goal is 100,000 STICKERS!!</div>
<div>College Students are our FUTURE!!  Their collective voice holds more weight than many realize!  Our goal is to further empower them to let it be known, that we the people, are for Bernie Sanders as our next President!  We are tired of politics as usual, and we are indeed ready for a Political Revolution!!</div> </div> <div> <h3>   </h3>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact You'll be Making</h3>
<div>You know that feeling you get when you're driving down the road and you see someone with a Bernie Sanders sticker on their vehicle??  It might be curiousity if you don't know about Bernie.  It might be joy that someone else is supporting Bernie, because you feel so strongly about his message and what he can do for this country and this world.   It might be reassurance, that someone else is feeling the Bern and his call for a Political Revolution.  Maybe you thought you were alone.  Well we want a lot more people, especially on college campuses to get those same feelings.   We want to create a buzz around every campus in the United States.  <br/><br/>If you get the majority of College Students in the United States on board with Bernie, we WIN the election.  Period.</div>
<div>Every $5.00 you give will help us get 25 stickers to students across the country!! That's like a beer at your local pub or a mocha latte at the Starbucks down the street.  </div>

As you may or may not know, College Students are not always rolling in the cash, therefore buying stickers, or campaign supplies in bulk is usually not an option for them.  This is why we want to help them!!
We are huge Bernie supporters and are active in a grassroots campaign in Asheville, North Carolina and the surrounding area.  After a an event called Bernie Bash we put on here, we had a few thousand stickers left over after using the funds we raised at the event.  We wanted these stickers to go to the people who needed them most.  Then we started to think big, as Bernie often suggests.  We understand that with the right vision and the help from fellow supporters, that this grassroots efforts can be funded by the PEOPLE, by Bernie supporters, and that we can get tens of thousands of stickers or more to campuses across the country.  Our Goal is 100,000 STICKERS!!
College Students are our FUTURE!!  Their collective voice holds more weight than many realize!  Our goal is to further empower them to let it be known, that we the people, are for Bernie Sanders as our next President!  We are tired of politics as usual, and we are indeed ready for a Political Revolution!!      
    The Impact You'll be Making
You know that feeling you get when you're driving down the road and you see someone with a Bernie Sanders sticker on their vehicle??  It might be curiousity if you don't know about Bernie.  It might be joy that someone else is supporting Bernie, because you feel so strongly about his message and what he can do for this country and this world.   It might be reassurance, that someone else is feeling the Bern and his call for a Political Revolution.  Maybe you thought you were alone.  Well we want a lot more people, especially on college campuses to get those same feelings.   We want to create a buzz around every campus in the United States.  If you get the majority of College Students in the United States on board with Bernie, we WIN the election.  Period.
Every $5.00 you give will help us get 25 stickers to students across the country!! That's like a beer at your local pub or a mocha latte at the Starbucks down the street.  
    
Other Ways You Can Help

Please visit our Facebook page!!  https://www.facebook.com/groups/767387390055455/Join our Group, and join the discussion.  Talk to College Students who are receiving our stickers!  Listen to their stories!  Ask questions!! We do what we can in life.  This is our way of trying to make a difference.  We hope that you'll consider supporting what we are trying to do.  It's not just about Bernie, it's about all of us and the future of our country and our planet.  It's about time for a real Political Revolution!!  A government for the People, by the People.

<h3>SafetyCurtain Details:</h3>
<p>The main ingredient in the <strong>SafetyCurtain</strong> is Kevlar -- a polymer with remarkable tensile strength and the ability to resist penetration -- the same material used in bulletproof vests. But, while vests and the <strong>SafetyCurtain</strong> serve the same purpose -- to protect the people behind them from penetrating bullets -- they perform their functions differently and have different Kevlar requirements. In particular, a protective vest incorporates <i><strong>many</strong></i> layers of Kevlar -- around 30 -- but the <strong>SafetyCurtain</strong> will require far fewer. A vest has to dissipate a bullet's impact in a very short distance, before it has a chance to damage the fragile human who's pressed rigidly against it. It must take account of what's called ""backface signature"" and spread out the force of the transmitted energy impact over its relatively small area, to prevent blunt force trauma. The <strong>SafetyCurtain</strong> will provide a large area for this dissipation of force ...and no one will be leaning against it -- so, far fewer layers of Kevlar will be required. Nevertheless, the <strong>SafetyCurtain</strong> will meet the same Type IIIA standards as the National Institute of Justice has established for bulletproof vests.</p>
<p>The energy absorbing feature of the <strong>SafetyCurtain</strong> will be enhanced by specially designed attachments for connecting the curtain to the floor and ceiling tracks. These will incorporate short, heavy-duty springs -- helping to absorb the force of bullets and thwarting a shooter's efforts to kick the <strong>SafetyCurtain</strong> open. The durable floor track will be very low profile ... and will come with a laser-guided system for positioning the ceiling track <i><strong>exactly</strong></i> correctly.</p>
<p>When installed, while not deployed the <strong>SafetyCurtain</strong> will retract into a protected enclosure. This will protect the Kevlar from UV exposure and excessive moisture levels ... and, because the case can be painted or decorated in any way desired, it will make the installation less intrusive. To further protect the Kevlar, the outer layers of the <strong>SafetyCurtain</strong> will be printed material. When deployed, the shooter side -- i.e., the side he'd encounter when entering a protected classroom -- will display some ""disturbing"" sort of optical design -- the sort of thing it hurts your eyes to look at. On the protected side, a variety of soothing images and colors are possible.</p>
<p>In a classroom protected with a <strong>SafetyCurtain</strong>, a shooter would see this:</p>

<h3>Timeline and Budget:</h3>
<p>Paul has already made a good contact with a polymer expert at the University of New Hampshire. This prof has confirmed the soundness of the idea -- i.e., that the <strong>SafetyCurtain</strong> will work! He's suggested that a newer polymer might work even better than Kevlar, has offered to put Paul in touch with a mechanical engineer (to help design the springy attachments) and will serve as a materials science consultant once the project gets going. Paul's also made contact with a local policeman -- who gave him an old vest to take apart and has offered to use the police shooting range to do informal tests of early prototypes.</p>
<p>This IndieGoGo campaign is meant to fund Research &amp; Development to capitalize on the ideas and planning done so far. The steps to be taken are pretty clear ... but we have no way of knowing how much some of these steps will cost. Converting the provisional patent to a full, regular patent will cost $10-15K (according to the Internet). Materials for experiments? Consulting fees? Prototyping? Lab testing and NIJ certification of the final product? Setting up for initial production? Neither of us has experience with this sort of thing -- not even enough to make truly sensible estimates of the expenses entailed. However, the campaign goal -- if we reach it -- <i><strong>should</strong></i> be enough to fund us all the way through R&amp;D and into some kind of limited production! Please consider making a contribution!!</p>
<p>By the way -- although it's really quite premature -- we plan to go into production in Arkansas. That's where Lynnie lives ... and she'll be in charge of this phase of things -- finding a building for the factory, buying equipment, hiring and supervising workers. Lynnie's plan is to hire workers who have been in rehab -- who often have trouble finding jobs and are thrown back into the same conditions which caused their problems in the first place. By paying a good wage and treating them fairly, we can help them have a good chance to turn their lives around -- while manufacturing a product entirely within the USA!</p>

<h3>FAQs</h3>
<p><strong>What will the SafetyCurtain look like when it's not in use?</strong></p>
<p>When retracted, the SafetyCurtain will reside in a box-like housing ... bolted to a wall of the classroom. The curtain itself will be completely out of sight. At present, the plan is to make this floor-to-ceiling housing in plain white. If it's painted in the color of the classroom walls, it will just look like the wall is jutting out there. Otherwise, it could be decorated in any way desired ...or serve as a bulletin board ... or etc..</p>
<p><strong>OK. So it will be bolted to one wall and locked to another. But, why can't a shooter just kick it in? What makes it secure on all 4 sides?</strong></p>
<p>The curtain is attached to the mechanism of the accordion door. This mechanism is then attached to the tracks on which it will glide. For the SafetyCurtain, these attachments will incorporate heavy-duty springs ... which will absorb the impact of a kick. Moreover, the high tensile strength of the Kevlar will resist a steel-toed boot as well as it does a bullet.</p>
<p><br/><strong>What will it cost? Won't it be too expensive for schools to buy?</strong></p>
<p>The honest answer is: We really don't know what it will cost. Certain R&amp;D tasks need to be accomplished before a good estimate might be given. Preliminary investigations into material costs have led us to believe that the SafetyCurtain can be produced and sold at a non-outrageous price! Both of us value frugality and efficiency and we both recognize how strained school budgets already are -- so we're aiming to offer the finished product at the lowest price possible.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Will it work?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it will! When Paul began to take his own idea seriously, one of the first things he did was to reach out to a polymer expert in the Materials Science department at University of New Hampshire -- to find out if the idea was feasible -- if it could work. The response was unequivocally positive! He made several helpful suggestions ... and is willing to act as a consultant once the project gets going. Moreover, once the SafetyCurtain is prototyped, it will go to one of the official labs that grant NIJ certifications ... and will have to meet the same standards as do bulletproof vests.</p>
<p><br/><strong>What sizes will it come in?</strong></p>
<p>As we currently plan it: Any size you need. We'll probably offer stock lengths ... where the next length up will always work. Probably a few stock heights -- where the next height down will work (via flexible attachments to the ceiling, shielded by a protective apron). Unless a classroom is really enormous or has a cathedral ceiling, we'll be making a SafetyCurtain which will fit!</p>
<p><br/><strong>Is there any reason why these are restricted to classroom use? What if I want one for my office space at work?</strong></p>
<p>Teachers and kids cowering in classrooms were what spurred the idea of the SafetyCurtain -- the need to give our kids the security they should have at school. But, there's no reason why they couldn't be installed in other places. Flexible track even opens the possibility of enclosing individual cubicles.</p>
<p><br/><strong>How far away do the kids have to be from the curtain so they don't get hurt?</strong></p>
<p>It will only be necessary that no one be leaning directly against the SafetyCurtain. Otherwise, students and teachers can move freely within the protected area of the room.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Will the lock hold ... or can it be shot off?</strong></p>
<p>The lock will be on the protected side of the SafetyCurtain, so it can't be shot off. It will be something simple -- like a padlock which hangs on the wall near the hasp which will get locked to the deployed curtain.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Will the SafetyCurtain protect <i>all</i> the kids in a school?</strong></p>
<p>Sadly, no. They'll only protect the kids in the rooms which have them. Moreover, people in the room where a shooter <i><strong>starts</strong></i> a rampage might not have much opportunity to get behind the barrier, even if they have one. The benefits of the <strong>SafetyCurtain</strong> are for those who aren't in the opening line of fire.</p>

<p><strong>Lynnie Bat-Abba</strong>:  I'm a Nurse and a Professor of English, but my heart is with my children and grandchildren. My sister and I are raising her two small grandsons – having moved to a farm in the mountains of Arkansas, where we hope to keep them safe. Eight of my nine grandchildren are being home-schooled, keeping them out of reach to those selfish lunatics who shoot little kids. But, this option isn't open to everyone.</p>
<p>My nursing experience of over 20 years has put me in direct contact with all ages, but my primary interest has been Hospice and the care of very small children with severe disabilities. Many of these children are enrolled in special education within public schools. They are the most defenseless of all in a shooting situation.</p>
<p>I was excited by the idea of the <strong>SafetyCurtain</strong> because I know the pain of losing a child. At least I know my daughter died quietly, not screaming in fear and pain. No parent should have to suffer the unending loss of a child – but, when they are murdered,  there is no peace or restitution which can erase the anguish. Implementing a way to protect our little ones is a way of doing our best to care for them. Sending our children to school shouldn't cause us to panic. We must be proactive. The <strong>SafetyCurtain</strong> would, at very least, alleviate some fear ... and at best, bring our babies home to us safe and sound -- not to bury, but to hold and cherish!</p>

I am environmental journalist and educator from Brazil, I am truly committed in doing my best to help protecting the Amazon Rainforest. You will find more details about the 8 years of my work for the forest on the video above.  Charles Eisenstein, Satish Kumar, John Croft and professors Philip Franses and Stephan Harding are some of the amazing people that understand the importance of this studies to me and my work.Last year, I started the Reconnection Amazon Rainforest Project, where I give classes and talks about the forest to youth and adults. I also take people to the forest and do deep ecology with them, so they will be able to open their hearts to reconnect emotionally with it. I believe that the affection between people and the Amazon is very effective and a way of saving it from destruction, specially when it is accompanied by scientific information.The idea of applying for a Masters degree in Holistc Science at Schumacher College came as a suggestion from Satish Kumar. He is a 78 year old indian activist, editor of Ressurgence magazine and founder of the college. I applied, was accepted and got a bursary + my savings and a first crowdfunding campaign, I raised almost everything I needed to study at Schumacher College as a master student. Currently and officially, I am doing the Post Graduate. To be able to upgrade to the Ms.c, I need + 4,900 pounds by December. The total amount of the course is £ 22,521. This is the experience, knowledge and education I need to be more prepared. The Ms. c in Holistic Science enables us to use rationality as well as intuition to go deeper in our relationship with nature and gives us very good tools that will certainly be very helpful to my work.Last official data from Brazil, published by Inpe, shows an increase of 69% in the deforestation rate from 2014-2015, the worst in 6 years. The indigenous and the whole life within the forest are being seriously threatened by mining, cattle ranging, cutting of illegal wood . big infra structure projects and so on.Through many different experiences, I´ve been working to keep the Amazon alive. With your support, I´ll be more prepared to keep walking this path. By supporting me, you will be help me protecting the forest. I am 100% aware of what I am saying and of my responsibility with you and your more than valuable contribution. Gratitude!Special thanks to all more than 100 supporters that made possible my arrival at the school, through so many different ways. Also, gratitude to my family, to Schumacher College for believing in me since the very first moment and to our beloved Amazon, that brought me here.If you want to know more about my work and the Amazon, please, visit:https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/supporting-t...Reconexao Amazonia - http://www.reconexaoamazonia.com/Thank you so much!",1.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</div><div> <p>VOVA faces three major challenges to our ambitions:  1) our unconventional approach to language; 2) working across distinctly different academic traditions; and 3) working with community language speakers, not as subjects, but as partners. We view these challenges, however, not as obstacles, but as principles and opportunities for reaching new horizons.</p>
<p>The unique contribution of VOVA to the growing efforts at valorizing indigenous languages and cultures has been to focus on the esthetic principles of language practice as a sustaining factor of cultural behavior, values, and resources.  Poetic practices in everyday language use may seem esoteric or even superfluous to policy makers and even some academics.  <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Oral literature is viewed by many literature scholars as inferior to the written word.  Stylistic approaches to verbal exchange have remained on the peripheries of core curricula in linguistics and anthropology departments. </span></p>
<p>Scholars devoted to responsible and accessible study of stylized speech practices in community life often remain marginalized in their university departments, many never even benefitting from a tenured position.  VOVA has responded to this situation by reaching out to scholars, both institutional and non-institutional, and building an international network for sharing methodologies and pooling resources. It is our ambition to create a foundation to provide research funds to researchers and to graduate students to advance institutional study of community vocal and verbal arts.</p>
<p>The international status of VOVA is a major strength of our initiative despite the complexities of merging age-old academic traditions that can often get lost in translation. One of the major undertakings of VOVA in overcoming these barriers has been to establish a multi-disciplinary nomenclature in English and in French.  An annotated bibliography is another of the tools that we will build onto the VOVA Exchange Platform as it progresses.</p>
<p>Successful partnership between academics and community language speakers is undoubtedly what makes the VOVA challenge such an exciting and fulfilling adventure.  Linguists and anthropologists have progressively moved from detached observers of language use and social life to cross-cultural diplomats. Partnership between academics and community-leaders as mutual stake-holders is a fundamental aspect to the very organization of VOVA. </p>
<p>Diversity is a fundamental policy of VOVA, from the administrative level to the scientific level.  Our Board of Directors includes members from the Chinook Nation, from the Confederated Tribes of Grande Ronde, from the Kiowa Tribe, from the Chippewa Tribe, from Mali, and from the Republic of Congo.

</div></div>","Who is VOVA? 
VOVA is a 501(c)3 non-profit, founded in 2008 to create a worldwide forum for community-based research in vocal and verbal art performances.  We are an international network of scholars in anthropology, linguistics, and literature working with endangered language speakers, students, teachers, and artists.  Our research promotes the arts of spoken word and voice in their diverse and infinite manifestations in cultures across the planet.

   Our Goals and Our Donors Our goal of $50K will allow us to develop custom-designed, secure interactive tools (a text-editor, databases, basic forums, uploads, etc) for our researchers and associates to work together on a single platform for the very first time!  
With your help, we will also develop the VOVA Speech Genres Gallery with an open-source, informative database available to the public. Researchers, language teachers, and community language speakers will be able to safely pool data reflecting the practice of speech styles and genres enjoyed in communities around the world. Visitors to our website will be able to view transcriptions, translations, photos, videos, and descriptive texts depicting community vocal and verbal art performances.
The Speech Genres Gallery will provide a cornerstone for the VOVA Exchange Platform that will offer state-of-the-art tools for:


editing and annotating oral discourse from community performances
crowdsourcing translations of edited texts
compiling descriptive, interpretive, and analytical data in open source databases and wikis
uploading audio and video recordings of community practices of vocal and verbal art styles, genres, and performances
educational tutorials
social media forums related to language, poetic speaking, and culture

To show our deep appreciation for the generosity of our donors, we have designed graphics for quality postcards and t-shirts that we hope you will enjoy.  These graphics reflect speech genres gathered from our studies and from verbal artistry shared by community language speakers. Donors may also enjoy the CD, Dedicated, by The Stoney Creek Singers, the Tutelo-Saponi group featured in our video. These perks were designed to inspire a fun way of thinking about language styles and speech genres and promote understanding and appreciation of poetic speech as it unfolds in everyday life. 

VOVA Genres T-Shirt design:



(Choose between unisex t-shirt made , sizes S, M, L, XL,and XXL;  OR a woman's t-shirt, sizes S, M, L, XL, and XXL.  Both t-shirts made with 100% certified organic ring-spun cotton, in navy blue).


Verbal Art Postcards:

The proverb is a genre commonly performed in verbal exchange in many regions of the world.  We have compiled proverbs in Akan-Twi (Ghana), Boomu (Mali), Hausa (Nigeria), and Teke (Republic of Congo), along with a Malagasy kabary, and a Tamil thirrukural for a collection of 6 Verbal Art postcards.   These cards are made with the finest quality custom printing on 100% cotton rag, both acid free and lignin free for long-term archival use.



The Stoney Creek Singers CD, Dedicated :

For an ear-pleaser, we are also offering our donors the CD entitled Dedicated by The Stoney Creek Singers, the Tutelo-Saponi singers from North Carolina who appear in our video.




""Now in their 21st year, The Stoney Creek Singers have traveled from coast to coast singing at some of the most prestigious powwows across North America.""

Verbal Art Research, More than a Symbolic Impact Poetic use of language in everyday speech is a universal practice.  Its concrete manifestations are, however, specific to individual languages and individual speakers. Sharing poetic voices across cultures serves to strengthen cultural identities, promote diversity, and develop human resources for world peace.
Massive amounts of knowledge and information are transmitted orally everyday, and protected by cultural use of mnemonic devices such as formulaic phrasing, rhyme, speech rhythms, and many other stylistic devices embedded in speech practice.  But it is the very practice of verbal art performance that interests us most. 


Jean-Louis' painting ""Palabres"" beautifully captures the powerful force of face-to-face verbal exchange.
Vocal and verbal art scholars have demonstrated the artful expressivity of hundreds of languages.  We know that rhetorical and stylistic use of language provides one of the most valuable resources held by a community.  The preservation of spoken language arts for future generations is absolutely crucial. 
Community-based linguistic education has proven to be a sound and sustainable tool for building cross-cultural communication skills, understanding, and mutual respect. We are convinced that increased attention to the values and resources of vocal and verbal art will lead to a improved understanding of the importance of multiple world views for cultivating humanity.
Moreover, scientists have clearly demonstrated the link between the planet's biodiversity and language diversity. Gorenflo et al. provide ""detailed global data showing the geographic extent of more than 6,900 languages, recently compiled by Global Mapping International, to analyze linguistic diversity in regions containing much of Earth's biological diversity, biodiversity hotspots and high biodiversity wilderness areas"" Gorenflo et al., 2009.

Protection of nature's ecosystems in biodiversity hotspots has long been a cultural priority for indigenous communities.  Honoring their traditions and learning from indigenous lifestyles requires more than documenting linguistic structures and biological taxonomies. It is absolutely crucial to respect and maintain the life conditions and cultures of communities that have prospered in their cohabitation with other life forms.

<p></p><p><b>HELP US GET LEGAL STATUS</b></p><p>My name is VO THI MY LINH. I was born and raised in Vietnam. I am 26 years old and I have co-authored ten books of short stories for teenagers. I published my first novel late last year. It received good reviews from many critics and will be made into a movie soon. My second novel will be published next month. </p><p>In  my first year of college, I wrote a letter to the Chairman of Binh Phuoc Province. The letter was successful in persuading him to give scholarships to poor students. After graduating from college, I worked for Trend &amp; Life magazine in 2012 and 2013 and quickly became an excellent reporter. In November 2014, I became more prominent after writing <a href=""http://nonghoc.com/show-article/80218/about-letter-to-the-minister-s-niece-linh.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">a letter to the Minister of Education</a>. In this letter I advocated an improvment in English educational programs in my developing country.</p><p>I started to write when I was a child. However, the writing I first practiced was the divorce agreements for my parents. I cannot recall the number of times I wrote different versions or the number of tears that ran down my face. I am certain that no words can describe the pain of a daughter who had to write divorce agreements for her parents. As a girl who grew up in a house where I witnessed domestic violence many times and where the crash of breaking furniture when my father got drunk was a frightening nightmare, I admitted that trying to help my mother get a divorce was the only way I could protect her.</p><p>Surprisingly, my mom chose to stay with my father. When I grew up, I realized that many women in my hometown suffered from domestic violence. Many of them were reluctant to divorce their husbands, as they were afraid of people judging them. Moreover, when they looked at others who were in the same situation, they probably assumed that domestic violence was normal. From that point on, I understood that poverty and a lack of education were the main reasons why women and children had to suffer domestic violence in my country.</p><p>One and a half years ago, I decided to quit a good job to travel. My principal aim was to find a way to communicate with foreigners to improve my English skills. However, to be honest, it was more because I wanted to break out of the imaginary prison I was in. I did not want to end up like my mother. I wanted to tell everybody who was suffering domestic violence that they have a right to live differently. I became well known after <a href=""http://tuoitrenews.vn/society/23375/vietnam-trekker-recalls-how-she-survived-nepal-avalanche"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">surviving and writing</a> about an avalanche in Nepal, which killed at least 43 of 168 trekkers on Annapurna Mountain. </p><p>That fateful trip took me to many wonderful things and finally I am here - the founder of the<a href=""http://volunteerhousevietnam.org/home/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Volunteer House Vietnam</a> project. The project is based on a very simple premise: free accommodation for foreign travelers in Vietnam in exchange for free English lessons for children.</p><p>With the help of many dedicated volunteers, I run this program with no funding.

I was born and raised in Vietnam. I am 26 years old and I have co-authored ten books of short stories for teenagers. I published my first novel late last year. It received good reviews from many critics and will be made into a movie soon. My second novel will be published next month. In  my first year of college, I wrote a letter to the Chairman of Binh Phuoc Province. The letter was successful in persuading him to give scholarships to poor students. After graduating from college, I worked for Trend & Life magazine in 2012 and 2013 and quickly became an excellent reporter. In November 2014, I became more prominent after writing a letter to the Minister of Education. In this letter I advocated an improvment in English educational programs in my developing country.I started to write when I was a child. However, the writing I first practiced was the divorce agreements for my parents. I cannot recall the number of times I wrote different versions or the number of tears that ran down my face. I am certain that no words can describe the pain of a daughter who had to write divorce agreements for her parents. As a girl who grew up in a house where I witnessed domestic violence many times and where the crash of breaking furniture when my father got drunk was a frightening nightmare, I admitted that trying to help my mother get a divorce was the only way I could protect her.Surprisingly, my mom chose to stay with my father. When I grew up, I realized that many women in my hometown suffered from domestic violence. Many of them were reluctant to divorce their husbands, as they were afraid of people judging them. Moreover, when they looked at others who were in the same situation, they probably assumed that domestic violence was normal. From that point on, I understood that poverty and a lack of education were the main reasons why women and children had to suffer domestic violence in my country.One and a half years ago, I decided to quit a good job to travel. My principal aim was to find a way to communicate with foreigners to improve my English skills. However, to be honest, it was more because I wanted to break out of the imaginary prison I was in. I did not want to end up like my mother. I wanted to tell everybody who was suffering domestic violence that they have a right to live differently. I became well known after surviving and writing about an avalanche in Nepal, which killed at least 43 of 168 trekkers on Annapurna Mountain. That fateful trip took me to many wonderful things and finally I am here - the founder of the Volunteer House Vietnam project. The project is based on a very simple premise: free accommodation for foreign travelers in Vietnam in exchange for free English lessons for children.With the help of many dedicated volunteers, I run this program with no funding. I have been devoting many hours a day to this project because I do not want English to be a tool for success for just those who have money. Also, I believe that English is a very important way for the poor to have a more cohesive life. It can help them become more aware that human rights are not only the right to eat and to live but also the right to be protected and to pursue happiness. The Volunteer House Project, after a year, has proven its success, and now operates in more than 18 cities where people are willing to let us use their dwellings as classrooms for free. As of now, more than 2,500 members from all over the country have registered to become volunteers for the project; 4 English classes in Ho Chi Minh City and 4 English classes in Hanoi have been established. Volunteer House Vietnam also has teamed up with AIESEC, GLC (two international organizations providing young people with leadership development and cross-cultural global internships) in HCMC to bring foreign students to Vietnam to undertake their internships  with our project. My only financial support  for the time I spend on this project is from the sale of my novel. I haven't bought any new clothes in a year but I'm confident that a woman is still beautiful without make up because of what she is doing.However, life is a struggle. To maintain this project, we need to get legal status from the government.  In Vietnam, it costs at least 50,000 USD to get legal status as a non-profit organization (NPO).

<p>We want to expand our film course offerings to include a wide array of feminist-inspired instruction. Our courses will address the gaps in so much of the history of film, spotlighting the women whose achievements have not received as much attention as they should have. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>OUR TEAM</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi! I’m Erica Goss, Director of<strong> <a href=""http://www.girlsvoicesmatter.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Girls’ Voices Matter</a></strong>. I’m a passionate believer in the potential of teen girls. I’m also a teacher and writer, and have worked for many years to help young people express themselves through various forms of storytelling. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I started <strong><a href=""http://www.girlsvoicesmatter.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Girls’ Voices Matter</a></strong> to help empower teenaged girls through storytelling, with a focus on media arts. At <a href=""http://www.girlsvoicesmatter.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Girls’ Voices Matter</strong></a>, girls learn many different forms of artistic expression, from writing poetry to making their own films. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’m pleased to be working with Dr. Claire Graman. Dr. Graman’s doctorate work focused on feminist film studies, with an emphasis on women in the silent film era and women in comedy. Dr. Graman is an experienced instructor, and will be teaching as well as developing our curriculum.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>WHY FEMINIST FILM HISTORY IS IMPORTANT</strong></h3>
<p><strong>LACK OF REPRESENTATION HURTS GIRLS</strong></p>
<p>As we all know, the lack of women’s representation, especially in film and media, is a critical problem. This can give girls the false assumption that activities such as directing movies are meant only for men, or that a woman must be perfect in order to succeed. This often causes girls to give up early, discouraging them from trying new things, and, eventually, can lead to low self-esteem.</p>
<p> </p>

We want to expand our film course offerings to include a wide array of feminist-inspired instruction. Our courses will address the gaps in so much of the history of film, spotlighting the women whose achievements have not received as much attention as they should have. 
 
OUR TEAM
 
Hi! I’m Erica Goss, Director of Girls’ Voices Matter. I’m a passionate believer in the potential of teen girls. I’m also a teacher and writer, and have worked for many years to help young people express themselves through various forms of storytelling. 
 
I started Girls’ Voices Matter to help empower teenaged girls through storytelling, with a focus on media arts. At Girls’ Voices Matter, girls learn many different forms of artistic expression, from writing poetry to making their own films. 
 
I’m pleased to be working with Dr. Claire Graman. Dr. Graman’s doctorate work focused on feminist film studies, with an emphasis on women in the silent film era and women in comedy. Dr. Graman is an experienced instructor, and will be teaching as well as developing our curriculum.
 
WHY FEMINIST FILM HISTORY IS IMPORTANT
LACK OF REPRESENTATION HURTS GIRLS
As we all know, the lack of women’s representation, especially in film and media, is a critical problem. This can give girls the false assumption that activities such as directing movies are meant only for men, or that a woman must be perfect in order to succeed. This often causes girls to give up early, discouraging them from trying new things, and, eventually, can lead to low self-esteem.
 
DID YOU KNOW…?
WOMEN HAVE ALWAYS BEEN INVOLVED IN MEDIA

Mary Pickford with Camera, ca 1916
So many of women’s achievements in film and media have been ignored or forgotten. 
For example, 


Alice Guy-Blaché directed the very first narrative film, The Cabbage Fairy, in 1896.

Lotte Reiniger made the first animated film, The Adventures of Prince Achmed, in 1926, eleven years before Disney’s Snow White. She also invented the first multi-plane camera in 1923.

Dorothy Arzner invented the boom microphone in 1929.

Edith Head won more Academy Awards for costume design than anyone in the history of film.

Mary Pickford co-founded the United Artists film studio in 1919.

These are just a few of the many female film pioneers whose names are not as widely known as they should be.

<strong>Global Health Skills Summer Institute for Youth</strong>—<strong>The Inspiration </strong>
</h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1577293943/jyvaqhoavxxfdxailiqj.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Following a disastrous accident, a young man came here from Uzbekistan for major facial reconstructive surgery. I read about him in the newspaper, and emailed him, asking whether I could be of help.</p><p>The extent of his injuries and the resulting surgeries meant that his education as a medical student back home was over. Since he had that medical background, and since he was so interested in computers, I suggested that he could combine his interests by pursuing a career in medical informatics. We began Visual Basic lessons, and he proved to be a natural at programming.</p><p>He applied to, and was accepted by, the highly-competitive computer-science program at the University of Washington. After his acceptance, one of my professors told me that his statement of purpose was so well-written that there was even some speculation among committee members that I had written it for him, since English was his third language. But all doubt that he had written the statement himself was erased in real time one night when this professor and my student began texting each other at 3 AM. From that conversation, it was very clear that his English was, in fact, really that good.</p><p>Experiences with students who are that motivated to learn and to succeed are what makes teaching so gratifying and full of joy for me. This project is a proposal to make that volunteer teaching into a full-time job, and a valuable resource for students. </p><h3>Summary</h3><p>I'm asking for donations to provide me with a $10,000 net salary to be able to turn my occasional volunteer tutoring for local refugee and immigrant communities into a funded project that includes a 2-week summer intensive overview of data science, bioinformatics, visualization, and mapping. It's win-win, because in that way, I will have the stable foundation to offer expanded access to technical skills and other educational support to populations who deserve them, yet who don't have a clear path to that support. </p><h3>Introduction</h3><p>My name is Ravensara Travillian. Most people call me Raven, because that's a lot easier to pronounce and to remember. I have been very fortunate in my life, and this project is my way of paying it forward in gratitude to people in my life who helped me when I needed it.</p><p>My early background was in mathematics and foreign languages. That focus stood me in good stead when I moved to Seattle in 1987, because the software industry was just getting started in localization: the process for making their software work correctly in foreign languages, as well as being culturally appropriate to the needs and preferences of the intended audiences. I'm very proud of the work I did then in making many different kinds of software available and accessible to non-English-speaking users—not only the languages with major markets such as French and German, but smaller (in market attention, if not in numbers), less-well-served languages such as Arabic, Hebrew, simplified Chinese, and Finnish as well.</p><p>That experience is where I first committed myself to making the power of valid information equally accessible for everyone. Everything I've worked at since then--working at the Refugee Clinic at Harborview Medical Center, returning to the University of Washington to complete a PhD in Biomedical &amp; Health Informatics, making hot food for my local food bank, helping to develop a clinic's community healthy-food garden, and now, working as a data scientist in global health--has been in the service of that commitment.</p><h3>The market niche in the communities</h3><p>This campaign is important to me because I'm committed to increasing access to the empowerment that information provides for everyone. And I know it's important to the intended audience, because of what happened when I attended a party at the home of a couple of leaders in one of the Seattle-area refugee communities.</p><p>I was chatting with one of the hosts, and I made an off-hand remark about how I thought I'd like to teach a programming class for young adults from the community someday. The conversation moved on to other topics, and I didn't give my casual remark any further thought until when--in less than half an hour--a small group approached me shyly, with a list of their email addresses, and asked me if I would be their teacher.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1577291006/rpltmafmfiphvvufbx4k.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>That is how deep the respect for learning and the hunger for programming knowledge runs in the community--word of our conversation had gotten around at the party, and the group--who, of course, I formed a study group with right away--wanted to pin down the details to make it happen right away. This group studied together for almost 3 years before the responsibilities of their lives (becoming parents; coping with life changes; becoming the first one in their family to ever attend and graduate from college) took them in different directions. But their eagerness and passion for learning, and their initiative in reaching out--based on nothing more than a casual conversation at a party--made a deep impression on me as a teacher.</p><h3>What I'm asking for</h3><p>I am a ""born teacher"", as one of my committee members observed at my dissertation defense; I am a committed and industrious volunteer for making information and resources more equitably available, and I have a wide variety of education and experience in academia and in the tech industry in Seattle. I would love to use all of these aspects of my experience to team up with you to create a joint project for the benefit of refugee and other underserved communities in the Seattle area, and I am asking for your help to make this happen.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1577290970/ohmgabgawc6jnlc2vsra.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1577291694/gtczdocc2iuy4kanj9sx.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>These classes will not be enough, in themselves, to turn them into data scientists or bioinformaticists, but they will help the students to see what's possible for them in their careers, what steps they can take in order to get there, and what resources exist to support them along the way. I don't expect to be able to cram all the necessary material into our short time together.

I am grateful for the opportunity to simultaneously:</p><ol>
<li>improve my housing security far beyond what I am capable of on my own;</li>
<li>get my scientific research and teaching career back on track; and</li>
<li>commit to empowering a group of deserving, passionate, and responsible young people to making the world better.</li>
</ol><p>If you've read this far, then I think that we share the goal of making the world better for our presence in it. This project makes progress on that front by addressing several hard challenges:</p><ul><li>The prospective students are balancing the equivalent of multiple full-time jobs, on multiple fronts. One major responsibility they have assumed is taking care of their parents and others in their communities who haven't adapted to the United States as thoroughly as the prospective students have. In addition to that work, many of them are now parents themselves, so they are raising their children. They hold down jobs, and some of them are now going to college to continue their education.</li></ul><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The way that they are shouldering these responsibilities demonstrates their work ethic, as well as their skill and resilience in working out solutions to problems that arise. Additionally, they have a commitment and relationship to the areas of their family's origin through their parents and communities. They are motivated and hard-working, and will be great college students and employees, if given educational opportunities.</p><ul><li>The terrain: as a professional in scientific publishing, I have witnessed the activity behind the scenes that both research universities and publishers are taking to expand their pools of researchers and reviewers to include demographically or geographically under-represented voices. They are serious in their efforts to increase diversity in the data science world, and by providing another path to those skills, the Summer Institute can help both the students who are looking for careers, and the institutions who seek to grow their outreach to more diverse candidates.</li></ul><p> </p><h3>What you will get in return</h3><p>Because I appreciate this opportunity so much, I want to show my appreciation by providing unique perks to donors who make it possible. There are different levels of support, with different perks that you receive, and you can read about them in more detail in the Perks section.

Following a disastrous accident, a young man came here from Uzbekistan for major facial reconstructive surgery. I read about him in the newspaper, and emailed him, asking whether I could be of help.The extent of his injuries and the resulting surgeries meant that his education as a medical student back home was over. Since he had that medical background, and since he was so interested in computers, I suggested that he could combine his interests by pursuing a career in medical informatics. We began Visual Basic lessons, and he proved to be a natural at programming.He applied to, and was accepted by, the highly-competitive computer-science program at the University of Washington. After his acceptance, one of my professors told me that his statement of purpose was so well-written that there was even some speculation among committee members that I had written it for him, since English was his third language. But all doubt that he had written the statement himself was erased in real time one night when this professor and my student began texting each other at 3 AM. From that conversation, it was very clear that his English was, in fact, really that good.Experiences with students who are that motivated to learn and to succeed are what makes teaching so gratifying and full of joy for me. This project is a proposal to make that volunteer teaching into a full-time job, and a valuable resource for students. SummaryI'm asking for donations to provide me with a $10,000 net salary to be able to turn my occasional volunteer tutoring for local refugee and immigrant communities into a funded project that includes a 2-week summer intensive overview of data science, bioinformatics, visualization, and mapping. It's win-win, because in that way, I will have the stable foundation to offer expanded access to technical skills and other educational support to populations who deserve them, yet who don't have a clear path to that support. IntroductionMy name is Ravensara Travillian. Most people call me Raven, because that's a lot easier to pronounce and to remember. I have been very fortunate in my life, and this project is my way of paying it forward in gratitude to people in my life who helped me when I needed it.My early background was in mathematics and foreign languages. That focus stood me in good stead when I moved to Seattle in 1987, because the software industry was just getting started in localization: the process for making their software work correctly in foreign languages, as well as being culturally appropriate to the needs and preferences of the intended audiences. I'm very proud of the work I did then in making many different kinds of software available and accessible to non-English-speaking users—not only the languages with major markets such as French and German, but smaller (in market attention, if not in numbers), less-well-served languages such as Arabic, Hebrew, simplified Chinese, and Finnish as well.That experience is where I first committed myself to making the power of valid information equally accessible for everyone. Everything I've worked at since then--working at the Refugee Clinic at Harborview Medical Center, returning to the University of Washington to complete a PhD in Biomedical & Health Informatics, making hot food for my local food bank, helping to develop a clinic's community healthy-food garden, and now, working as a data scientist in global health--has been in the service of that commitment.The market niche in the communitiesThis campaign is important to me because I'm committed to increasing access to the empowerment that information provides for everyone. And I know it's important to the intended audience, because of what happened when I attended a party at the home of a couple of leaders in one of the Seattle-area refugee communities.I was chatting with one of the hosts, and I made an off-hand remark about how I thought I'd like to teach a programming class for young adults from the community someday. The conversation moved on to other topics, and I didn't give my casual remark any further thought until when--in less than half an hour--a small group approached me shyly, with a list of their email addresses, and asked me if I would be their teacher.That is how deep the respect for learning and the hunger for programming knowledge runs in the community--word of our conversation had gotten around at the party, and the group--who, of course, I formed a study group with right away--wanted to pin down the details to make it happen right away. This group studied together for almost 3 years before the responsibilities of their lives (becoming parents; coping with life changes; becoming the first one in their family to ever attend and graduate from college) took them in different directions. But their eagerness and passion for learning, and their initiative in reaching out--based on nothing more than a casual conversation at a party--made a deep impression on me as a teacher.What I'm asking forI am a ""born teacher"", as one of my committee members observed at my dissertation defense; I am a committed and industrious volunteer for making information and resources more equitably available, and I have a wide variety of education and experience in academia and in the tech industry in Seattle. I would love to use all of these aspects of my experience to team up with you to create a joint project for the benefit of refugee and other underserved communities in the Seattle area, and I am asking for your help to make this happen.  These classes will not be enough, in themselves, to turn them into data scientists or bioinformaticists, but they will help the students to see what's possible for them in their careers, what steps they can take in order to get there, and what resources exist to support them along the way. I don't expect to be able to cram all the necessary material into our short time together. Rather, I want to spark a flame and passion for learning, and an awareness that yes--given time and effort--they, too, are capable of work and education that they may have assumed is out of their reach. The needI seek $10,000 salary (net) to be able to make the transition from volunteer teaching to teaching as my entrepreneurial venture.The value that I will provide in return for the $10,000 is to organize, develop, and teach a pilot project consisting of a 2-week set of modular classes focused on capacity-building in computer technology and data science for global health, and tailored for youth from local communities that do not have access to the same educational resources that many Americans are able to take for granted.  This project is the Global Health Skills Summer Institute for Youth. If the first year is successful, then I will commit to carrying it out every summer through 2025, as well as to training younger people to carry it on (capacity-building) once I pass the torch to them.  The impact of your supportYour donations will enable me to resume my scientific and teaching career from where I had to leave it because of a medical ordeal. I am grateful for the opportunity to simultaneously:
improve my housing security far beyond what I am capable of on my own;
get my scientific research and teaching career back on track; and
commit to empowering a group of deserving, passionate, and responsible young people to making the world better.
If you've read this far, then I think that we share the goal of making the world better for our presence in it. This project makes progress on that front by addressing several hard challenges:The prospective students are balancing the equivalent of multiple full-time jobs, on multiple fronts. One major responsibility they have assumed is taking care of their parents and others in their communities who haven't adapted to the United States as thoroughly as the prospective students have. In addition to that work, many of them are now parents themselves, so they are raising their children. They hold down jobs, and some of them are now going to college to continue their education.The way that they are shouldering these responsibilities demonstrates their work ethic, as well as their skill and resilience in working out solutions to problems that arise. Additionally, they have a commitment and relationship to the areas of their family's origin through their parents and communities. They are motivated and hard-working, and will be great college students and employees, if given educational opportunities.The terrain: as a professional in scientific publishing, I have witnessed the activity behind the scenes that both research universities and publishers are taking to expand their pools of researchers and reviewers to include demographically or geographically under-represented voices. They are serious in their efforts to increase diversity in the data science world, and by providing another path to those skills, the Summer Institute can help both the students who are looking for careers, and the institutions who seek to grow their outreach to more diverse candidates. What you will get in returnBecause I appreciate this opportunity so much, I want to show my appreciation by providing unique perks to donors who make it possible. There are different levels of support, with different perks that you receive, and you can read about them in more detail in the Perks section. They range from Summer Institute-themed keepsakes, to personal progress reports, to participation in a recognition dinner.I am using the Indiegogo flexible funding option. That means that, if I don't reach my entire goal in the month that this campaign lasts, I get to keep the funds that I was able to raise.

I am taking those into account as I develop my plan. And I have qualities to help me face those challenges, and a track record of not giving up.I persevere.

We know who our target audience is, we have curriculum and websites in place and teachers ready to go. Additionally, we have partnered with one of the most reliable online providers in the U.S.
We are starting with the English speaking countries outside of the U.S. for the first 60 days and then will add additional countries as we progress.  Your financial support over the next 90 days allows us to open ACPA and enroll our first class of students in August of 2019. Your dollars will help make a top quality education a reality for kids who may have previously been locked out by poverty or circumstance.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I am an IT professional with over six years working in education and the rehabilitation of militants and internally displaced persons. In recent years I’ve developed an interest in Project Management and Business Analysis and slowly pivoted towards this field. I have a bachelor’s degree in Mathematics/Computer Science from the Federal University of Technology, Minna, Nigeria and a master’s degree in Management of Information Technology from the University of Nottingham, United Kingdom. I was motivated to make this pivot in my last role as the IT Projects Officer at Combat &amp; General Strategy International (CGSI), an organisation dedicated to the rehabilitation and re-integration of internally displaced persons, I always wanted to be able to offer more.</p>
<p>My experience with CGSI and the difficulties that Nigerian youth like myself continue to face with securing employment motivated me to determine how skill acquisition could be deployed for youth development and alleviate the increasing unemployment rates in Nigeria. Because of my background, my goal is to make technology an integral part of the skills acquisition process.</p>To execute the next phase of this goal, I applied for the IDEX Global Fellowship Program for social intrapreneurs. I was accepted into the programme and offered a grant scholarship of $1000.<p> </p>
<h3>Funding My Journey to Becoming  A Social Intrapreneur</h3>
</div><p>The IDEX Fellowship Program is a six-month programme commencing on the 2nd of July 2018 and ending on the 21st of December 2018. It is a tuition based program with a fee of $2,950 and amounts to $9262.5 when other pertinent costs are included. Consequently, I’m reaching out to friends, family and people who wish to support me in my journey toward productive social entrepreneurship to raise the funds to cover:</p><ul>

<h3>The IDEX Global Fellowship Program</h3>
<p>IDEX stands for Intrapreneur Development Experience.

Social intrapreneurs are becoming key actors in the race towards a new kind of economy. These change-makers are supporting and leading the development of scalable solutions to some of the world’s most pressing challenges - from health to education to environment. Contrary to social entrepreneurs, social intrapreneurs are innovating from within an existing enterprise or organization.</p>

<h3>Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>There are multiple ways you can help me achieve my dreams of going to India! I’m aware that not everyone will be able to offer help financially, but these are things you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share my Indiegogo link! Spread the word! Thanks to the internet and social media, it’s a lot easier to share information quickly and across vast distances.</li>
<li>Networking is key. I’m currently searching for acquaintances in Bangalore that can share experiences and information which could help me hit the ground running when I eventually arrive.</li>

<h3>What's a Reading Pacer?</h3>
<p>Reading Pacers are a carefully designed system of nine reading guides and a reading coach's manual. Reading Pacers boost reading efficiency by training readers to decrease distractions, regressions, develop reading rhythms, and create effective eye movements.</p>
<p>Most of us are still using the same reading skills we were taught in grade school. Reading Pacers break the old reading mindset. This method is for goal-driven individuals who need more control over their time and who have a passion for knowledge.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our product has been tested in the classroom. Our product will help reduce the drop out rate, inspire confidence, and change reading mindset. You can coach others to use it. This reading method is designed for at least a 6th grade reading ability.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking for $45,000 to cover our final production costs and advertising. The product molds have already been made and 5000 units have been produced. The reading manual is done and needs to be printed. Some packaging materials have already been purchased. Product can be shipped in plus/minus 30 days and will be sold through Amazon.</p>
<p>A $20.00 donation gets the Reading Pacer set, which includes 9 reading guides, 3 handles (means 3 people can use it), 15 pages of nuts and bolts reading instructions, and free shipping cost in the US. What only 20 bucks? Your contribution is sincerely appreciated for production/labor.</p>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>We have skin in game and no debt at this point! Our biggest challenge will be advertising the product and getting the word out. We are developing a well-conceived program which includes, social media, display advertising, email campaigns, use of Google ad-words, and proven affiliates programs.</p>

<p>My name is Bridger Frederick, I am a 23 year old
kid with a dream of travelling around the world by bicycle, while building up a
network of people who eventually want to come together in the future and build
a community with a certain set of principles and ideals aimed at personal
growth while minimizing our cost to the planet. A community with a different
mind-set and way of life that actually promotes health and happiness. My launch
pad for this whole idea will be my writing and other projects while I am cycling and camping my way up
the length of Africa and beyond, living off the average daily wage of the people
in each country. There will be a cap of ten dollars a day and a minimum $1.14
per day in Burundi. </p>
<p>This trip is about so much more than just the
immense personal growth that will naturally stem from such a diverse and
arduous journey through so many different environments and countries. It's
about spreading education and inspiring people to realize their dreams despite
any obstacles in their way. The magnitude and impact of this project is
infinite. I am thinking 40 years into the future and the skills, knowledge,
network, capital and assets I am going to need to flourish in that world and
this is the first step in a massive start up. And to be frank I need your help. I have depleted my bank accounts on the flights, gear, most of the bikes paid
off, immunizations and a myriad of other expenses. The $5000 goal is for the
ongoing funding of the trip. Money will be spent on food, writing materials, internet access, bike maintenance, and self publishing of some books I'm composing. Contributors can also rest assured that they will see
exactly how the money is being used as I am creating a financial breakdown of
the entire trip, to show fellow adventure enthusiasts exactly what it takes to
see the world.</p><p>I must emphasise that no matter what comes of this crowdfunding venture I'll be in Africa within the next 48 hours, pedalling away and that's where you'll find me for the next couple years regardless of outside funding. This funding will be a massive jumpstart to sharing this adventure this with the world.</p>
<p>The not so tangible reason for becoming a part of
this project and fueling it with capitol is that I can from the depths of my
heart say you will play a part in my goal of leaving some sort of long
lasting positive impact on this earth. My gratitude would be infinite as you
would be directly contributing to my dreams with your hard earned cash and that
to me is an inspiration in itself. I want to share my story with the world,
because the turbulent events of my life to date have lead me to a firm belief
that happiness and success are founded exclusively on establishing and living
by a certain set of rock hard, unwavering principles that guide your life. And
because of the happiness and empowerment adopting this has brought me I
feel as though bringing that into the lives of the ones I love and all people
is simply the next step. </p>
<p>I am going to Africa to ride from the bottom of
the continent to the top. The risks and challenges I face will be many and
immense I am sure. The shear physical intensity of riding a bike with
everything I own through the deserts, mountains, forests, and jungles of Africa
will be arduous as it gets. Combining that with the mental intensity of a being
surround by extremely different cultures and often extreme poverty adds the
next tier of risk and challenge. But that's exploration, that's adventure and
that's what I thrive off. It's when I'm my happiest, my most creative and my
most perceptive. It spurs, ignites and drives the infinite energy I feel inside
me towards something greater than myself. </p>
<p>This is my dream and any contribution would be you
helping me realize it. Monetary contributions are a massive help and so
essential to the trip but if that isn't an option for you sharing this with
people who would find this story interesting or want to be a part of this
project is an equal or greater contribution on its own in making this project
move forward. Thank you so much for even taking the time to read about my life
and welcome to the adventure. </p>

<p><b>1 - Hello Little Dragon</b></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Inspired by ‘old-school’ tamagotchi ©, Hello Little Dragon is your very own learning buddy in full play mode. Little Dragon is usually happy to see you, though he’ll frown and scowl if the mood takes him - or if you look at him the wrong way.  He’s full of character, makes children smile and encourages them to play and learn.  You can nurture Little Dragon, show him love, and be delighted at how he sees you and responds.</span></p>

<p> </p>
<p><u><strong><i>What's up Little Dragon? (part of Hello LD)</i></strong></u></p>
<p>Feelings fuel and colour pretty much all of our experiences, and so we want to help children learn about theirs - the earlier we start to nurture emotional understanding the better.  In our groundbreaking new game - '<i>What's up Little Dragon?</i>' -  our cute and curious hero will accompany his little human learner in exploring everyday situations and the emotions that come along.</p>
<p>We’re confident that kids and parents alike will enjoy and learn from this game and excited to get your feedback and input.  What’s most emotionally challenging for your child?  Maybe we can work together to help all of our kids make sense of their feelings and thrive in making friends and enjoying relationships.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>2 - English Reading Games</b></p>
<p>English is the most studied language on the planet and, while it is notoriously difficult, smooth acquisition of the ability to read English underpins the general experience of school and has lifelong implications. Accordingly, our first set of traditional ‘academic’  learning content takes kids to other worlds where the alphabet and sounds of letters await in a range of fun games. </p>
<p>In designing this flagship content we have worked with a range of national reviews, policies, and approaches to teaching.  Our cutting-edge contribution to this highly contentious field of education will integrate a range of existing best practices with the entirely new Little Dragon interface.  </p>

<p><i>Little Dragon hatches. Let's unlock these other planets together … literally ,-)</i></p> <p><b>3 - MY LITTLE DRAGON backpack</b></p>
<p>This puppet and case evolved from the starting point of bringing Little Dragon more to life by giving him a body.  iPads are cool, but they’re not very huggable. </p>
<p>Our Little Dragon Puppet really has life.  When our designer and seamstress Jina made the first one, not only was it hugged within minutes of being introduced to our little learners, but we realised it was also a backpack.  The next part of My Little Dragon's life was when we recognised its ergonomic properties: as an iPad stand it helps your child avoid slouching into poor postures, huddled over a tablet for example, protecting against neck and back strain.  Win win.  We can't wait to see your My Little Dragon stories unfold!</p>

<p>We are especially committed to reaching the kids on the fringes: the ones whose ‘special educational needs’ challenge teachers and parents the most, and the many at risk of being left behind.  This means working with those at the front line in ways that they need.  Our <a href=""blog%20post"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">newest initiative</a> is a partnership with a learning centre for refugee children under UNHCR in Malaysia.</p>
<p>Extending education to kids with least access has been part of our mission since inception.  So, as part of this crowdfunding campaign we are partnering with <b>a UNHCR supported school serving refugee children</b>.  We are doing this to raise awareness of the particular challenges facing these children struggling to access school in Malaysia and to bring them into our project from the get-go.  Like children everywhere, these amazing kids are who Little Dragon is for and their involvement is essential in helping us shape it for their needs.  We welcome 10 backers who want a My Little Dragon themselves to cover production costs only so that you can share the same again.  With these 10 Little Dragons in a school dozens of kids <span>will also get to experience personalised emotionally intelligent learning.</span></p>

<p><b>Challenges and Innovations</b></p>
<p>As an emotionally-attuning AI-based one-to-one tutor, Little Dragon is taking-on two fascinating challenges familiar to all teachers who want to help children learn happily and efficiently: </p>
<p><b>Challenge ONE</b>: Making sense of complex patterns of human emotional expressions and providing attuned interactions.</p>
<p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Challenge TWO:</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> Delivering optimally appropriate content to the learner at each step of his or her learning adventure.</span></p>This is how Little Dragon is innovating to provide an attentive and responsive teacher for each child:<p> </p>
<p><b>Innovation ONE:</b> Little Dragon reads and analyses patterns of user behaviour, facial emotion expressions, and other sensory data.  <span style=""background-color: initial;"">A range of insights from behavioural and educational sciences then inform the ways in which the system reacts. Little Dragon is designed to constantly improve its efficiency by trying different approaches based on the user’s individualised and situational pattern of interaction.  In other words: Little Dragon will experiment and optimise based on what works best to support the learner’s progress.</span></p>
<p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Innovation TWO:</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> During preliminary sessions with Little Dragon, each child will play calibration games that will help the system understand what level of difficulty and types of lesson suit that child at that moment. As the child continues to learn and progress, the type of activity, content, and timing of delivery will be based on the individual child’s patterns of emotional engagement and ability.  Accordingly, learning content within Little Dragon will be composed of games that appeal to certain senses and moods, with a challenge level that is just right. </span></p>

<p> </p>
<p><span><b>1. When will Little Dragon be available?</b></span></p>
<p>The app will be available for public download at the beginning of 2017. However, we are aiming to deliver a first powerful version of Little Dragon to our backers by Christmas 2016.</p>
<p><b>2. For what devices will Little Dragon be available for?</b></p>
<p>We are currently developing the App for iPads running an up-to-date iOS. As resources permit we will extend to other operating systems.  If we exceed our funding target of $50000 by 50 % we will be able to deliver an Android Version as well!</p>
<p><b>3. What kind of Lesson Content will be available?</b></p>
<p>To start with we deliver learning activities for preschool and primary school aged children. The flagship content will include activities to support Emotional Intelligence and English Reading (see Learning Content above).  </p>
<p><b>4. In which languages will Little Dragon be available in?</b></p>
<p>Little Dragon’s first language will be English, though – being attuned to behaviour and emotional expression - much communication will be nonverbal. Other language versions  will follow.</p>
<p><b>5. Who can use Little Dragon?</b></p>
<p>Everybody. At first we are focusing on preschool and primary school kids. Over the longer term we will offer content for all age groups.</p>
<p><b>6. There is an abundance of learning Apps out there - How is LD different?</b></p>
<p>Even the most advanced learning apps currently on the market are limited to evaluating performance through mechanical input when adjusting content for the learner. By contrast, Little Dragon also gathers streams of user emotional expression and contextual data to infer state of engagement and adjust the individual child’s learning experience. This is a leap forward in personalising education. </p>
<p><b>7. The Data is highly valuable - Do you plan on selling it?</b></p>
<p>We are not going to sell data to any 3rd party. We protect our users anonymity by strict separation of personal data and learning data. This is important because learning data, especially when enriched with biometric data is a valuable source of information that needs to be protected. Responsible use of data is one motivation for us to start this project.</p>
<p><b>8. Will Teachers lose their jobs?</b></p>
<p>Absolutely not. In fact, we can only imagine that with Little Dragon and other such approaches the profession will attract and retain more teachers. Many of our teachers are stretched to breaking point: class sizes, and the impossible task of tailoring their teaching skills to a huge range of learners, is clearly at the heart of the problem. A <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/mar/22/teachers-plan-leave-five-years-survey-workload-england"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Guardian survey</a> in March of 2016 found that almost half of the teachers in England plan to leave the profession in the next five years: 82% stated that their workload is unmanageable, and almost three quarters said that the workload has a serious impact on their physical and mental health. Little Dragon will feedback on each student’s progress and teachers can take a more active and informed role in guiding them through school. Teachers will have more time, energy, and mental space to plan more broadly, collaborate with other teachers on innovative activities and ways that technology and other resources can be used. There is unlimited possibility for wonderful synergies between our teachers and Little Dragon.</p>
<p><b>9. Are kids not already spending too much time on iPads?</b></p>
<p>We really don’t want to encourage kids and families to be spending more time staring into screens. Our primary emphasis is on well-being. With Little Dragon’s ability to attune to a child’s level of ability and engagement we can make learning happier and more effective. This frees kids and families to do other stuff. So we achieve better screen time, not more screen time.</p>
<p><b>10. I Have much more questions!</b></p>
<p>Awesome! Have a look at <a href=""http://littledragon.artha.hk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">our website</a> and see if you find your answers there, and/or please contact us!</p>

Your children will learn about school subjects and other areas of interest more happily and efficiently. Learning and playing will become closer than ever. Little Dragon does this by constantly reading and responding to your emotions: when things are getting too difficult or too easy, Little Dragon will adjust the content to keep you in an ideal flow of learning.

Focus on each individual child When children are given consistent one-to-one attention they can feel recognised and understood.

Uncompromising Data Anonymization

Our core understanding is that:

Early experiences of learning have profound long lasting effects on our lives
ALL children deserve the best opportunities to learn
Kids naturally love to learn - adults just need to nurture that
All children are unique with their own way of doing things
A ‘one-size fits all’ educational system stifles the joy of learning for most 
Learning and playing can be two sides of the same coin




 

1 - Hello Little Dragon
Inspired by ‘old-school’ tamagotchi ©, Hello Little Dragon is your very own learning buddy in full play mode. Little Dragon is usually happy to see you, though he’ll frown and scowl if the mood takes him - or if you look at him the wrong way.  He’s full of character, makes children smile and encourages them to play and learn.  You can nurture Little Dragon, show him love, and be delighted at how he sees you and responds.
   
   
Little Dragon responds to users states by reading facial expressions. 
 
What's up Little Dragon? (part of Hello LD)
Feelings fuel and colour pretty much all of our experiences, and so we want to help children learn about theirs - the earlier we start to nurture emotional understanding the better.  In our groundbreaking new game - 'What's up Little Dragon?' -  our cute and curious hero will accompany his little human learner in exploring everyday situations and the emotions that come along.
We’re confident that kids and parents alike will enjoy and learn from this game and excited to get your feedback and input.  What’s most emotionally challenging for your child?  Maybe we can work together to help all of our kids make sense of their feelings and thrive in making friends and enjoying relationships.  
 
2 - English Reading Games
English is the most studied language on the planet and, while it is notoriously difficult, smooth acquisition of the ability to read English underpins the general experience of school and has lifelong implications. Accordingly, our first set of traditional ‘academic’  learning content takes kids to other worlds where the alphabet and sounds of letters await in a range of fun games. 
In designing this flagship content we have worked with a range of national reviews, policies, and approaches to teaching.  Our cutting-edge contribution to this highly contentious field of education will integrate a range of existing best practices with the entirely new Little Dragon interface.  

Little Dragon hatches. Let's unlock these other planets together … literally ,-) 3 - MY LITTLE DRAGON backpack
This puppet and case evolved from the starting point of bringing Little Dragon more to life by giving him a body.  iPads are cool, but they’re not very huggable. 
Our Little Dragon Puppet really has life.  When our designer and seamstress Jina made the first one, not only was it hugged within minutes of being introduced to our little learners, but we realised it was also a backpack.  The next part of My Little Dragon's life was when we recognised its ergonomic properties: as an iPad stand it helps your child avoid slouching into poor postures, huddled over a tablet for example, protecting against neck and back strain.  Win win.  We can't wait to see your My Little Dragon stories unfold!



My Little Dragon unlimited edition: Body, Backpack, and Ergonomic Case

 

4 - Buy One - Donate one
We are especially committed to reaching the kids on the fringes: the ones whose ‘special educational needs’ challenge teachers and parents the most, and the many at risk of being left behind.  This means working with those at the front line in ways that they need.  Our newest initiative is a partnership with a learning centre for refugee children under UNHCR in Malaysia.
Extending education to kids with least access has been part of our mission since inception.  So, as part of this crowdfunding campaign we are partnering with a UNHCR supported school serving refugee children.  We are doing this to raise awareness of the particular challenges facing these children struggling to access school in Malaysia and to bring them into our project from the get-go.  Like children everywhere, these amazing kids are who Little Dragon is for and their involvement is essential in helping us shape it for their needs.  We welcome 10 backers who want a My Little Dragon themselves to cover production costs only so that you can share the same again.  With these 10 Little Dragons in a school dozens of kids will also get to experience personalised emotionally intelligent learning.
 

5 - Video Conference Workshop
You get all elements of Little Dragon (My Little Dragon + Games) PLUS we will join you wherever you are via the interweb: one or all three of our founders will beam into your home, classroom or boardroom for an hour to give targeted guidance on aspects of our project that matter to you.

 
 
6 - Little Dragon UNIQUE Edition  
Each of these is brought into being through an intimate process of material selection and careful handcrafting (see images above).  As Jina meticulously and lovingly breathes life into these creatures the population of Little Dragon siblings in her workshop slowly grows...   If you decide you want to take one of these into your home you will get your uniquely numbered My Little Dragon and a certificate of creation signed by Jina.

You will also enjoy ongoing support over one school term so that you and your students can make the most of learning with Little Dragon. Choose the perk that fit's your schools needs best.

8 - Emotional Learning Workshop
Get a condensed and personalized access to our team’s expertise. If your organization is anywhere near as excited by our mission as we are, you will probably have a notion of how much we have learned since inception. We will bring what we have, field our workshops to what you are doing, and share our insights on where you might go with Emotional Learning and AI driving Education.

 

We are confident that we can ship a first, limited version of Little Dragon to our Early Backers for Christmas 2016. 
After receiving your much needed feedback, our goal is to ship Little Dragon with a full set of English Reading and Emotional Learning games by March 2017. 
By May 2017 we will be able to roll-out classroom tools for teachers and other educational professionals.

We will keep our backers up to date with our progress and let you know if we encounter any setbacks.
 







Help us develop Little Dragon to maturity: We need $50,000 to put our emotion engine into operation. With this funding we will be able to complete development of our first set of innovative learning content and deliver the first ever iPad-based emotionally attuning AI tutor.

Since the base work for the app is done we can focus on integrating amazing games. Depending on your preferences we will dedicate about  50% of the funding to manufacture outstanding backpacks to give Little Dragon a real world body.
 

We need Parents, Teachers and the wider education community to support the idea by fielding it in their schools and homes.
We want to reach out to publishers, content creators and people who care about education to explore new ways of innovating learning.  


 





You will be a pioneer in the field of emotional human-machine interaction. Be one of the first to experience a machine responding directly to your feelings.

4. In which languages will Little Dragon be available in?
Little Dragon’s first language will be English, though – being attuned to behaviour and emotional expression - much communication will be nonverbal. Other language versions  will follow.
5. Who can use Little Dragon?
Everybody. At first we are focusing on preschool and primary school kids. Over the longer term we will offer content for all age groups.
6. There is an abundance of learning Apps out there - How is LD different?
Even the most advanced learning apps currently on the market are limited to evaluating performance through mechanical input when adjusting content for the learner. By contrast, Little Dragon also gathers streams of user emotional expression and contextual data to infer state of engagement and adjust the individual child’s learning experience. This is a leap forward in personalising education. 
7. The Data is highly valuable - Do you plan on selling it?
We are not going to sell data to any 3rd party. We protect our users anonymity by strict separation of personal data and learning data. This is important because learning data, especially when enriched with biometric data is a valuable source of information that needs to be protected. Responsible use of data is one motivation for us to start this project.
8. Will Teachers lose their jobs?
Absolutely not. In fact, we can only imagine that with Little Dragon and other such approaches the profession will attract and retain more teachers. Many of our teachers are stretched to breaking point: class sizes, and the impossible task of tailoring their teaching skills to a huge range of learners, is clearly at the heart of the problem. A Guardian survey in March of 2016 found that almost half of the teachers in England plan to leave the profession in the next five years: 82% stated that their workload is unmanageable, and almost three quarters said that the workload has a serious impact on their physical and mental health. Little Dragon will feedback on each student’s progress and teachers can take a more active and informed role in guiding them through school. Teachers will have more time, energy, and mental space to plan more broadly, collaborate with other teachers on innovative activities and ways that technology and other resources can be used. There is unlimited possibility for wonderful synergies between our teachers and Little Dragon.
9. Are kids not already spending too much time on iPads?
We really don’t want to encourage kids and families to be spending more time staring into screens. Our primary emphasis is on well-being. With Little Dragon’s ability to attune to a child’s level of ability and engagement we can make learning happier and more effective. This frees kids and families to do other stuff. So we achieve better screen time, not more screen time.
10. I Have much more questions!
Awesome! Have a look at our website and see if you find your answers there, and/or please contact us!",45.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>An acceptance to Uppsala University is a big deal, Uppsala is on the lists of the 100 best universities in the world and the program that I applied to only accept 14% of the applicants (The proof that I was accepted to the masters program at Uppsala University can be found in the gallery) But not only is the university a great choice but for someone like me who are passionate about renewable electricity, Sweden really is the place to go to. Sweden makes green technology a big priority and because of that the country has become the first country in Europe to meet the renewable energy targets that was set by the EU for 2020. Sweden already met those goals 2012, eight years before schedule!

<p>My country Brazil is a developing country and it’s struggling with developing infrastructure that both is sustainable but also meets all the needs of the people. This is something my higher education in Uppsala could prepare me to start changing. Brazil is one of the most financially unequal countries in the world and only around 30% of kids in school continues to high school. My country needs a change and I know I can contribute to that change. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>You might wonder why I can’t pay for the education myself but here is the truth, I come from a working class family, but my mother happens to prioritize education. She was a professor before she retired, but retired people in Brazil don’t really get a good enough pension so I have to help my family out every month. I have a stable job in a government owned company, but it doesn’t pay much compared to the salaries in North America or Europe. Compared to those standards I earn close to nothing. I need your help to be able to do this. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>My plan is to get a doctors degree in renewable electricity production, hopefully in Sweden and after that I want to open the first factory in Latin America that produces solar panels. There is a high demand in Brazil for solar panels, but it’s expensive especially right now when we all know about the political situation here in Brazil. People have a demand and a need, but it’s just not sufficiently met by my society. I know I have the ability to contribute to my society. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I also want to help people like me one day, maybe even some day I can create a foundation that can give out scholarships for higher education. It all comes down to will I be able to get the education and the advanced knowledge I need to really make this happen? This is where you come into the picture. With your help I can do this!  </p>

<h2>de Terre &amp; d'Argile</h2>
<p>Je suis Mohamed Zied GHARBI, Architecte Tunisien et président de l'association "" de Terre &amp; d'Argile"" une association qui a pour objectif la promotion de la construction en terre crue en Tunisie.</p>
<p>Ce mode de construction durable a plusieurs vêtus, qu'elles soient environnementales, sociales ou économiques, vu que sa matière première se trouve juste sous nos pieds et qu'elle appartient à tout le monde.</p>
<p>J'ai découvert la terre crue à travers des chantiers participatifs, et cela été un coup de foudre. Donc j'ai décidé que j'allais en faire mon métier et mon engagement. C'est pour cela que j'ai eu l'idée de candidater pour un diplôme de spécialisation en terre crue en France, pour être apte à former de futurs architectes et bâtisseurs de la terre crue, car en Tunisie nous en avons besoin surtout dans les zones rurales.<br/><br/>J'ai été accepté  pour faire cette formation de spécialisation en terre crue ,en sachant que c'est la seul formation qui existe dans le monde avec celle de l'MIT au USA et que cette formation n'accepte que 22 étudiants chaque deux ans, donc c'est un privilège d’être parmi eux, mais reste la barrière financière qui m’empêche de réaliser cet objectif pour moi-même et mon pays.<br/><br/>C'est pour cela que j'ai lancé cette compagne de crowdfunding pour collecter de quoi demarer ma formation.<br/><br/>Je compte sur vous mes amis, merci d'avance et à bientôt.</p>
<p>coûts:</p>
<p><br/>_ Visa pour la France: 80 euro</p>

de Terre & d'Argile
Je suis Mohamed Zied GHARBI, Architecte Tunisien et président de l'association "" de Terre & d'Argile"" une association qui a pour objectif la promotion de la construction en terre crue en Tunisie.
Ce mode de construction durable a plusieurs vêtus, qu'elles soient environnementales, sociales ou économiques, vu que sa matière première se trouve juste sous nos pieds et qu'elle appartient à tout le monde.
J'ai découvert la terre crue à travers des chantiers participatifs, et cela été un coup de foudre. Donc j'ai décidé que j'allais en faire mon métier et mon engagement. C'est pour cela que j'ai eu l'idée de candidater pour un diplôme de spécialisation en terre crue en France, pour être apte à former de futurs architectes et bâtisseurs de la terre crue, car en Tunisie nous en avons besoin surtout dans les zones rurales.J'ai été accepté  pour faire cette formation de spécialisation en terre crue ,en sachant que c'est la seul formation qui existe dans le monde avec celle de l'MIT au USA et que cette formation n'accepte que 22 étudiants chaque deux ans, donc c'est un privilège d’être parmi eux, mais reste la barrière financière qui m’empêche de réaliser cet objectif pour moi-même et mon pays.C'est pour cela que j'ai lancé cette compagne de crowdfunding pour collecter de quoi demarer ma formation.Je compte sur vous mes amis, merci d'avance et à bientôt.
coûts:
_ Visa pour la France: 80 euro
_ coût du voyage : 200 euro_ frais d'inscription : 980 euro 
+ CVEC ( contribution à la vie étudiante et de campus): 90 euro_  logement : 400 euro/mois = 1200 euro pour les trois premier mois
_ coût de la vie en générale : 3650 euro (d’après les information communiqué par le consulat de France en Tunisie)
cela fait : 6200 euro pour commencer mes etudes.
Converti en dollar americain: 7250 $

<h3>About Me.</h3>
<p>Firstly, THANK YOU for visiting my page. I'm humbled that you are reading my pitch.</p>
<p>I'm Felix Brunger, former DJ, now a professional actor and soon to be acting student.</p>
<p>This is my story...</p> <p>Six years ago, after a successful career in music, I decided to take my first acting class. It had been a long time coming since my last one in secondary school. Five classes later (petrified but absolutely hooked) I found myself enrolling on a 16-week course training in the Miesner Technique at The Actors' Temple, London. It was a complete roller coaster but I loved every second. On completion, I went out fresh into the industry and had the good fortune of being cast in many professional projects. Significant highlights included the one-man show, ‘The Anorak’, 'My Favourite Madman' at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and short film 'In Retrospect'. Following  these successes I signed with an agent.</p>
<p>Since finding my life path, my desire to train at an accredited drama school has been paramount. In pursuit of producing work of the highest level of artistic quality, this postgraduate diploma is instrumental in my development. It will support my commitment to pursuing the study and craft of acting. Deepening my knowledge I will be prepared for expertise in critical analysis; expanding my understanding of it's historical and cultural context.</p>
<p>Your investment is a means of transformation for me. You will not only be contributing to my development as a student in the classroom, but postgraduation your help will enable a foundation to create excellent work. It will open doors for me in theatre, film, television and radio.</p>
<p>One goal post training is to continue to write and produce my own work with my seedling production company, The Faculty Productions. It’s aim is to produce new exciting cross platform work with the spirit of collaboration at it’s heart</p>

<h3><strong>What this Training means to mean:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Fact</strong> : Accredited Drama schools are notoriously tough to gain places at.</p>
<p>The chances are slim, with on average a few thousand hopefuls auditioning at each school for one of the coveted 12 or so places. Do the maths and you'll see that this opportunity is EPIC! </p>
<p>Good training lays down the groundwork from which to excel from. Not only will I have an extensive toolbox of skills in which to create from, I'll also be mentored by some of the top teachers in the profession, who are all working and relevant in the profession. The process will enable me to work in many different acting based environments with confidence, knowledge, a spirit of enquiry and with my imagination.  </p>
<p>Drama schools like DSL offer a stamp of recognition and quality with in a highly competitive industry. In such a high risk environment with tight budgets and limited time; casting directors, producers and directors need to have absolute confidence in the talent they select. I believe this training would reinforce my development as an emerging actor, and enable me to take my work to the next level.</p>
<h3><strong>Drama Studio London ( DSL)</strong></h3>
<p>Drama Studio London is a founding member of the Federations of Drama Schools in the UK - one of the 20 accredited schools which offer the highest standard of training in the vocational drama sector.

<h3><strong>The Nitty Gritty</strong></h3>
<p>The total cost of my course is £14,723 ( including Trinity Exams) -  I'll be applying for a Career Development Loan, as sadly there is no Student Finance available for this course. The maximum I can apply for being £10,000 (roughly 80%) if successful, and it all needs to be paid back when the course is complete. </p>
<p>I've never been shy of grafting or working hard for something I believe in, so along side this campaign, Yours Truly is brightening up the days of many a confused tourist in Covent garden, working full time in a restaurant ( Meryl Streep waited tables to pay for Yale don't cha know!). In addition to this I have planned to work part time during my training to support myself. Due to the intense nature of the course, it may not always be an option. However I am willing to try!</p>
<p>Why £3000 and not the whole thing?</p>
<p>After much thought, I've decided to pitch my campaign at an amount I hope can be realistically achieved in the small time frame of<strong> 8 weeks</strong> - with kind and generous support.  </p>

<h3><strong>Short Summary</strong></h3>
<p>OUR VISION </p>
<p>Let's Imagine is a non-profit organization that offers education to youth across the globe focusing on self-empowerment, emotional wellbeing and nature-connection.</p>
<p>OUR MISSION </p>
<p>Our mission is to create sustainable solutions by teaching youth to have compassion for themselves, their communities and the environment.</p>
<p>Y.A.E CURRICULUM </p>
<p>The curriculum that we have developed blends yoga, art and earth-based learning. </p>
<p><strong><i>Why Yoga - </i></strong></p>
<p>Yoga, through breath and awareness, provides space to step back and regulate your response to stress in a calm and thoughtful manner. Studies have shown that yoga can help build a sense of optimism. This in return has a positive impact on academic and social development.  </p>
<p><strong><i>Why Art -</i></strong></p>
<p>If yoga is the journey to the self, art is the truest expression of the self. Yoga connects us to the creative potential that dwells within, while art enables us to manifest and express infinite creative possibilities. </p>
<p>Albert Einstein said, ""Creativity is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution."" We do not quote Einstein to discredit knowledge, but rather to raise awareness to the importance of creativity.</p>
<p>We trust that art helps foster emotional development of a child and encourages children to think creatively.</p>
<p><strong><i>Why Earth-based practices -</i></strong></p>
<p>Earth-based practices complete the circle in the powerful trifecta of teaching yoga, earth, and art; it is both the beginning, where the seed is planted, and the end, where the fruit has blossomed. We aim to guide children towards remembering their roots in the natural world by facilitating educational experiences in nature.</p>
<h3><strong>Why is this campaign important?</strong></h3>
<p>Let's Imagine is hosting our first free yoga camp program in Lovina, North Bali,Indonesia. Let's Imagine has partnered with Bali Children Foundation to host yoga camps to local Balinese youth.</p>
<p>The sustainability of this project is a huge value of ours and to help ensure a lasting impact, we created a scholarship to help students continue their yoga education in the hope that job opportunities in this field can unfold.  </p>
<p>This scholarship will not only benefit the selected student, but also their community as they are invited to come back to our future yoga camps to teach and share their path. </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>We are asking for $5,500.00 to cover the cost of a full scholarship for Ratih, a local Balinese student, to attend a 200 hour yoga teacher training. In return, you will receive a Mudras for Health and Healing Coloring Book. </p>
<h3><strong>Unique Perks</strong></h3>
<p>“You can’t live a perfect day until you do something for someone who will never be able to repay you.” -John Wooden </p>
<p>By purchasing our Mudra Coloring Book, you help make it possible for Ratih to attend a yoga teacher training. Beyond this, you'll receive a coloring and journaling book that has been designed with love.</p>
<p>This coloring book will break down a handful of mudras, which are hand gestures used during meditation that carry specific goals of channeling your body’s energy flow. For our first coloring book, we have selected commonly used mudras that have been championed for centuries for their efficiency in providing health and empowerment.</p>
<p>This intricate, artful coloring book will teach you about different mudras, their benefits, how to use them and when to use them. The mudra drawings were hand drawn by artist and Let's Imagine volunteer, Curt Bean. Get lost in your design and learn to heal yourself with the help of powerful mudras! </p>
<p><i>*Please note that in addition to the cost of the Mudra Coloring Book ($15.00), we kindly ask for $5.00 for shipping within the U.S. and $8.00 for international shipping. </i></p>
<h3><strong>Where will the funds go if we do not reach our goal?</strong></h3>
<p>If we do not reach our entire goal, the funds will be stored in our 'Let's Imagine Scholarship Fund', where they will remain until we receive adequate funding to cover the cost of a yoga teacher training.</p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Since our first yoga camp, Ratih showed a commitment to learning yoga.</p>
<p>Ratih is deeply passionate to continue her yoga journey and further her yoga education. If granted this scholarship, she would give back to her local community by sharing her knowledge. She would be qualified to be a yoga teacher at future Let's Imagine camps, which we believe would help our organization have an even stronger impact on Balinese youth. Ratih will be a role model for her fellow peers and the younger students.</p>
<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>Some risks we might face are not raising enough to reach our goal of providing Ratih a full scholarship to attend a yoga teacher training. Perhaps we also risk yoga schools not accepting Ratih into their program. </p>
<p>However, we are both confident and optimistic that we will reach our fundraising goal. Aside from this campaign, we can also host donation based yoga classes and events to help us reach our goal. Additionally, we will ask local studios in Bali if they could offer a discounted rate for our scholarship recipient. We are relentless in our pursuit to find a school that is both fitting for and accepting of Ratih and our future scholarship recipients. </p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>If you cannot purchase a Mudras for Health and Healing Coloring Book today, you can still help! </p>
<p>Here's How:</p>
<p>·        <strong><i>Spread the word! - </i></strong>talk about our campaign with your friends, family, colleagues and network. </p>
<p>·        <strong><i>Share it on social media - </i></strong>Promote our campaign and tag us on your social media accounts to reach an even larger network </p>

We are relentless in our pursuit to find a school that is both fitting for and accepting of Ratih and our future scholarship recipients.

<p>On August 27th 2016, Brighton High's class of 2001 will hold its 15-year reunion at Snowbird resort. But here's the catch--we're only going to do it if enough people sign up--we need at least 75. If we don't hit our goal, no one has to pay and we'll try again in 5 years:)</p>
<p>If you want to come, now's the time to sign up and front the money. You can also sponsor additional aspects of the party if you're inclined to contribute beyond the minimum level. </p>
<p>Anyone can contribute, but only those who attended Brighton High School in Utah anytime from 1999 to 2001 (and their significant other) may attend this event. </p>

We are in the midst of organizing additional unique events such as helicopter vineyard & winery tours, heli-mountain biking, heli-hiking, paintball expeditions, lighthouse and island tours, & heli-golf to name a few. The sky is the limit. By 2030 let's plan to ski the moon! LOL!


     

Commitment to Community and World Affairs:
As we aim to leverage the amazing feats a helicopter can perform for skiing, we realize there is another critical task in our communities where a helicopter can change lives. By donating 5% of our profits to Lifeflight of Maine, their ""vision for Maine as a place in which every person, in every community, has access to critical care and medical transport when they need it,"" can be further realized and supported. LifeFlight helicopters, flying at 165 miles per hour, bring lifesaving critical care directly to people in Maine when they need it most. Help us help them, fly strong.

        

 

Many are unaware that the worst humanitarian disaster in recent history is occurring in Syria, with virtually no assistance from the outside world. Recognizing the atrocities and utter lack of aid, Alison McKellar, my best friend, tech support, and mother of my son Colton, has partnered with the amazing NuDay Syria, to collect food, winter clothing, medical supplies, tarps, and used boat shrink wrap for shelters. They organize, pack, and pay to send shipping containers to the most destitute places within Syria, something Red Cross is barely able to do. 5% of our profits will help Alison and NuDay Syria's commitment to delivering aid to Syrian refugee camps.
Risks and challengesBy using Saddleback's ski trails to pilot this mission, we have taken out a lot of the risks and challenges of delivering you and your mates an epic experience with high quality, safe terrain, though realize that weather can be unpredictable and effect our ability to fly. If, we have weather issues on the scheduled March 7th. inaugural flight, we will give you a free voucher to ski Saddleback using their lifts that day and aim to execute the heli-ski, the next day March 8th. Saturday, March 14th would be next. The second event is directly related to the weather, as we await and build extra excitement leading up to a beautiful snow storm, clear skies that follow, and incredible conditions with heli-access. Don't delay, please contribute to this campaign, and bring heli-skiing home. Again this all or nothing!Of the $35,000 we are raising $20,000 will go to mobilizing, flying, fueling, and providing the 206B Jet Ranger helicopter for two days of heli-skiing. $5,000 for insuring the events, $2,500 for marketing, filming, IT, web support, and Go Pro cameras, $2,500 for Indiegogo and credit card processor's fees, and $5,000 to lease and develop new, previously un-skiable terrain.So, we've covered the place to do it, the helicopter, insurance, legal review and truly feel we have a live one here and are ready to rock and roll with you. Now we need to let your passion for skiing and your financial muscle flex by chipping in and helping climb this Heli-Bear into the Air!Thank you for your Love and Support!!Very Special Thank you's:Saddleback Mountain Resort and GM Chris Farmer for pioneering with usDan Hickman, for the gorgeous helicopter footage of SaddlebackJim McCully and Maine Helicopters Inc. for flying the visionKristen McKellar, technologist and teammate extraordinaireBill Ryan and Ryan Financial Services for their consulting and financial supportAndrew and Holly Zulieve of Zulieve LawJim Chalmers of Chalmers Insurance GroupJared Emerson, Operations Manager at Saddleback for his input and coordinationAlison McKellar and Vincent Jones for their love and supportOur boys, Colton and Mason, for inspiration and the precious lenses of a child's eyeMom, for the Love and adventurous spirit.

<p><b>America needs a third party, maybe even a fifth</b>. The revolution will not be televised however, America's third party will not be formed in the streets. Not to belittle to amazing efforts we have seen from protestors put forth, but if we do not transfer that energy to the ballots it will be all for naught. The only one that can fix this is you. With over 400 seats up for grabs, America has the rare opportunity of turning Congress on its head. Through surgical coordination with the ""ONE-TERMERS THINK TANK"", this Super PAC will target every Congressional Seat that is running against a Bernie-Crat. With our app, America will have a level of influence in politics never seen before. This Super PAC is powerful because, it is only interested in one result, Berning Down Congress.<br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>To do this we will be creating an app to serve as a tool for this change;</b><b> the app will be available to anyone for free, bringing greater voter awareness to all Bernie-Crats and One-termers based on location.</b></p>

<h3>CONGRESS  IS BROKEN<br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>This congress is the most unproductive body in history.</b> If today's workers are at risk of losing their jobs due to runaway capitalism, and bad trade agreements (TPP)  then so should the American congress. Firing your Congress and placing yourself (Or a One-termer) in office, is  the most democratic thing someone can do in 2016.<br/></p>
<br/><h4>America has one of the <b>most powerful tools</b> available to kick out the <b>corrupt</b>, and bring in the new.</h4>
<p><br/></p>
<p align=""center""><b> ENTER THE WRITE IN</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>The write-in allows Americans to choose a candidate that can bypass the traditional mess of primaries, caucuses, and super-delegates which a tend to make mockery of our voting process.</b> Allowing them to challenge the <strike>True Welfare Queens</strike> incumbents who spend their time campaigning instead of working through the write-in is the first step to getting money out of politics. America should not settle for a <b>BROKEN CONGRESS</b>. We do this because our friends, neighbors teachers or basically anyone, can not afford the time/money needed to get on the ballot, despite being a sobering improvement for our democracy. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>We need working class heroes to run for congress, and we need them to win.</b><br/></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: justify;"">                    The Write in Needs an Upgrade</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>What does this mean? <br/></b></p>
<p><b>It means, currently, the whole state of New York could not get John Oliver elected, even if they wrote his name in</b>. Unless he files the necessary paperwork and makes the whole State aware simultaneously, he will never  win<b>. </b>Even after that, <b>John Oliver's</b> name is not publicly displayed at the ballot office. Unless someone can use massive amounts of money or celebrity, America will never get the THIRD choice it so badly craves.</p>
<p><b> </b><br/></p>
<p align=""center""><b>HOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO GET ON THE BALLET</b></p>
<p>Depending on the State it can cost <b>thousands</b> of <b>signatures</b>, <b>dollars</b>, or <b>both</b>.<br/></p>

<p>There is too much money in politics<b>- </b>Our democracy is experiencing historic levels of <b>corruption and incompetence in the United States Congress. </b><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 align=""center""><b>Enter Shutdown The Fuck Barrel Super PAC <br/></b></h2>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>A Renegade <b>Millennial Super PAC</b> on a mission to start Americas Progressive Party by systemically firing our Congress with the surgical precision of Tinder and the wit of Mark Twain. The Third Party starts the moment we truly <b>diversify Congress</b> with<b> Comedians</b>, <b>Anthropologist</b>s, <b>Scientists</b>, Bernie-Crats and <b>YOU</b>. <br/>
</h4>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Shut Down The Fuck Barrel PAC is the Super PAC by and for the people. We are the response to a congress owned by billionaires, corporations, and lobbyist who treats congress like their personal strip club. </b>Shut Down The Fuck Barrel PAC was inspired via satirical news…or actual journalism. Shows like the Daily Show, The Nightly Show, and Last Week Tonight, have been effective in using satire as a tool for activism, speaking out against all forms of discrimination, corruption, and anything else Fox News would include on its Tinder profile. </p>
<p>Political satire, rooted in truth, allows the comedian to illustrate the absurdity of politics. Following the same model, Shut Down The Fuck Barrel PAC is a satirical approach to a very real problem, elections purchased by Super PACs. Citizens United v. FEC deemed that money equals free speech, removing restrictions on “independent” political spending. Well America, if money equals free speech, then let them hear you fucking roar. <b>Instead of attempting to reverse Citizens United, we see this ruling as an opportunity to benefit the underrepresented while also re-establishing a lost generation’s voice in politics</b>. <br/><br/><b>Our plan includes activating voters, as well as encouraging more Americans to run for office at the Federal and State levels.</b> By spending effectively and strategically, the PAC serves as a financial megaphone for the politically and economically oppressed, and a means of generating awareness without collaborating with candidates published at Theonetermers.com. and Onetermers App.<br/></p>
<p><b>We will generate awareness through Philanthropic Acts of Community Investment (P.A.C.)</b><br/><br/>This isn’t the SUPER PAC Bernie asked for, but it is the one he needs. In the words of Henry Ford. “If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses”. <br/></p>
<p><b>The main purpose is to help get people with the same values as Bernie elected to Congress. For less than a Netflix subscription ($6 per month /72 per year) you can subsidize actual democracy, give a voice to the voiceless and Shut Down The Fuck Barrel and make congress #FeelTheFuckingBern</b></p>

<p><b>We need everyday people with the same values as Bernie Sanders to run for Congress</b>. Bernie Sanders has already fundamentally changed America's political landscape.

<b> $1,000,000</b> will allow us to Kick Start ""The One Termers Think Tank"", begin work to rebuild congress, execute P.A.C.s and to develop the app.</li>

When thousands of people get behind an idea and give a little, revolutions can happen. We want this to work, but not a steep cost to anyone.

<li> We will also use the money to impact upcoming Georgia and Florida Elections. Specifically, we will target the potential Super Majority in Georgia's State legislature so that bills like the Anti- religious freedom bill never see the floor of the assembly. We will also start a new trend in political marketing, philanthropy in action. Why?

Congress Has Become a Money Funded FuckBarrel And If You Don't Vote That Will NEVER Change.
 
""Why should I vote? All of the candidates are the same? They are just the lesser of Two Evils!""




This is the single biggest issue facing today's elections. 
Many of our friends and family stay home and opt out of because they believe their vote doesn't count. This coupled with those that show up mindless to vote for party lines, has caused a trickle down effect of corruption in our political system. The combination of these behaviors has guaranteed that America keeps electing people they hate. That's right America, we keep electing a group of welfare queens to run our country's checkbook. 





Our Solution?







Make your vote matter again
Revitalize the Progressive Party in Congress
Subsidize your democracy 








  


America needs a third party, maybe even a fifth. The revolution will not be televised however, America's third party will not be formed in the streets. Not to belittle to amazing efforts we have seen from protestors put forth, but if we do not transfer that energy to the ballots it will be all for naught. The only one that can fix this is you. With over 400 seats up for grabs, America has the rare opportunity of turning Congress on its head. Through surgical coordination with the ""ONE-TERMERS THINK TANK"", this Super PAC will target every Congressional Seat that is running against a Bernie-Crat. With our app, America will have a level of influence in politics never seen before. This Super PAC is powerful because, it is only interested in one result, Berning Down Congress.

To do this we will be creating an app to serve as a tool for this change; the app will be available to anyone for free, bringing greater voter awareness to all Bernie-Crats and One-termers based on location.

TINDER MEETS THE BALLOT BOX



How does it work? Just like Tinder, it uses your location. You will be able to put your street address and zip code into the App. If a Bernie-crat or One-termer is available to win the election, you will receive this push notification to your phone. 

""Historic Event Unlocked""
"" You have a Third Choice in your area""

 Once you review the candidate, if you like what you see, simply swipe right. That's a pledge to vote.  All users in the area can view the number of dedicated pledges. This will allow you in real time to view the votes in your community. Now you will know not only that your vote counts but that you're a part of a much larger effort. More importantly, you can do all this political badassery from the comfort of your couch, favorite coffee shop, work, or anywhere your phone goes. Congratulations, You have no excuse for missing an election ever again.

""When democrats stay home congress turns red.""
-Tof
 ""One of the penalties for refusing to participate in politics is that you end up being governed by your inferiors""



This isn't the Super PAC Bernie asked for, but its the one he needs

What is a Super PAC?

CONGRESS  IS BROKEN


This congress is the most unproductive body in history. If today's workers are at risk of losing their jobs due to runaway capitalism, and bad trade agreements (TPP)  then so should the American congress. Firing your Congress and placing yourself (Or a One-termer) in office, is  the most democratic thing someone can do in 2016.
America has one of the most powerful tools available to kick out the corrupt, and bring in the new.

 ENTER THE WRITE IN
The write-in allows Americans to choose a candidate that can bypass the traditional mess of primaries, caucuses, and super-delegates which a tend to make mockery of our voting process. Allowing them to challenge the True Welfare Queens incumbents who spend their time campaigning instead of working through the write-in is the first step to getting money out of politics. America should not settle for a BROKEN CONGRESS. We do this because our friends, neighbors teachers or basically anyone, can not afford the time/money needed to get on the ballot, despite being a sobering improvement for our democracy. 
We need working class heroes to run for congress, and we need them to win.


                    The Write in Needs an Upgrade

What does this mean? 
It means, currently, the whole state of New York could not get John Oliver elected, even if they wrote his name in. Unless he files the necessary paperwork and makes the whole State aware simultaneously, he will never  win. Even after that, John Oliver's name is not publicly displayed at the ballot office. Unless someone can use massive amounts of money or celebrity, America will never get the THIRD choice it so badly craves.
 
HOW MUCH DOES IT COST TO GET ON THE BALLET
Depending on the State it can cost thousands of signatures, dollars, or both.

The 2016 presidential race will be the most expensive election in U.S. history — projected to cost more than $10 billion!





There is too much money in politics- Our democracy is experiencing historic levels of corruption and incompetence in the United States Congress. 

Enter Shutdown The Fuck Barrel Super PAC 

A Renegade Millennial Super PAC on a mission to start Americas Progressive Party by systemically firing our Congress with the surgical precision of Tinder and the wit of Mark Twain. The Third Party starts the moment we truly diversify Congress with Comedians, Anthropologists, Scientists, Bernie-Crats and YOU. 


Shut Down The Fuck Barrel PAC is the Super PAC by and for the people. We are the response to a congress owned by billionaires, corporations, and lobbyist who treats congress like their personal strip club. Shut Down The Fuck Barrel PAC was inspired via satirical news…or actual journalism. Shows like the Daily Show, The Nightly Show, and Last Week Tonight, have been effective in using satire as a tool for activism, speaking out against all forms of discrimination, corruption, and anything else Fox News would include on its Tinder profile. 
Political satire, rooted in truth, allows the comedian to illustrate the absurdity of politics. Following the same model, Shut Down The Fuck Barrel PAC is a satirical approach to a very real problem, elections purchased by Super PACs. Citizens United v. FEC deemed that money equals free speech, removing restrictions on “independent” political spending. Well America, if money equals free speech, then let them hear you fucking roar. Instead of attempting to reverse Citizens United, we see this ruling as an opportunity to benefit the underrepresented while also re-establishing a lost generation’s voice in politics. Our plan includes activating voters, as well as encouraging more Americans to run for office at the Federal and State levels. By spending effectively and strategically, the PAC serves as a financial megaphone for the politically and economically oppressed, and a means of generating awareness without collaborating with candidates published at Theonetermers.com. and Onetermers App.
We will generate awareness through Philanthropic Acts of Community Investment (P.A.C.)This isn’t the SUPER PAC Bernie asked for, but it is the one he needs. In the words of Henry Ford. “If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses”. 
The main purpose is to help get people with the same values as Bernie elected to Congress. For less than a Netflix subscription ($6 per month /72 per year) you can subsidize actual democracy, give a voice to the voiceless and Shut Down The Fuck Barrel and make congress #FeelTheFuckingBern

BERN CONGRESS DOWN




We need everyday people with the same values as Bernie Sanders to run for Congress. Bernie Sanders has already fundamentally changed America's political landscape. Electing people with the same values as Bernie, will allow Bernie as a President, to actually implement the agenda he has proposed, with none of the purposeful obstruction seen in Obama presidency.

Why Comedians, Scientist, Anthropologist?
Comedians are the kryptonite to the Bullshit Congress feeds the American public. The reality is, that there is no better person Anthropologically to call out Congress publicly on their corruption.
Do you hate Science? Congress does! This needs to change, and it happens when you elect Scientist and Anthropologist. Anthropologist see through the Bullshit rituals and fallacies Congress participates in. You don't believe us? Please read the book Tribes On The Hill


Imagine a world where Neil deGrasse Tyson is Speaker Of The House



Congress is broken because of its lack of diversity, and it seems to be allergic to Science. With an approval rating of 10% not only is this America's Most Hated Congress, it is the least effective. The reality is if anything in your life had a 10% approval rating, you would actively seek a way to get it out of your life. We believe this Congress deserves no exception.



America’s corruption crisis is the #1 issue for the entire 2016 race. With your help, Shutdown The Fuck Barrel Super PAC will not only get the country talking about money in politics, but offer a cheap solution to diversifying congress, while blanketing America with hilarious acts of Philanthropy as a form of modern day political marketing.
If billions are going to be spent on this election, we believe the money should be used to creatively spread awareness and simultaneously help the under-represented.
This Video by Represent.us perfectly illustrates why this Congress MUST GO

  What We Need 


If you cannot afford to donate financially don't feel bad, instead donate as much social media currency as you can. We need this to be shared, with anyone who wants the next Congress to work with Bernie NOT against. John Oliver? 
With an approval rating of 10% the reality is there are HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of people who are tired of this congress. To work at full capacity, we need less than 10% of these people to get engaged. This number is realistic but only if you share.
 We need thousands of people to be aware that a third choice is finally   
 $1,000,000 will allow us to Kick Start ""The One Termers Think Tank"", begin work to rebuild congress, execute P.A.C.s and to develop the app.

From there we ask that you donate 6 dollars a month, and tell your friends and families about it. We chose 6$ a month because we wanted to encourage as many people as possible to participate in the political process. When thousands of people get behind an idea and give a little, revolutions can happen. We want this to work, but not a steep cost to anyone. The overarching goal is to raise a billion dollars, so that we can not only help millions of people with our unique philanthropy Super PAC model so that we can accomplish what we set out to do.....Refresh Congress and FIX DEMOCRACY.


If funded the think tank will start hiring immediately, to help run the most intelligent funniest think tank in America. It's gonna be Yuge.

  The think tank will generate content, media, academic research on the issues that matter. Start a Comedic political Radio Show. Create hilarious Ads to be shared via the world wide web.


 We will also use the money to impact upcoming Georgia and Florida Elections. Specifically, we will target the potential Super Majority in Georgia's State legislature so that bills like the Anti- religious freedom bill never see the floor of the assembly. We will also start a new trend in political marketing, philanthropy in action. Why? Because we are a SUPER PAC and we may spend however we please, as long as we do not coordinate with Federal Candidates. We don't plan to speak to any. We are a renegade Super PAC



Philanthropic Acts of Community(P.A.C.)

Solar Paneling in low-income neighborhoods


Sponsor Habitat for Humanity community events


Subsidize Food Truck Festivals in cities with High Homeless populations


Restore abandoned neighborhoods and community programs

Anything else we or you can come up with, anything is fair game when you're a Super PAC gone rogue.

If we don't reach our Goal we will try again because creating a Congress that will work for Bernie is not something the American people can afford to pass up. With 400+ seats Up for Election in 2016, we can't afford to quit...and neither can you!

The reality is, the only way we can create a Congress that will work with Bernie is to actively flip congressional districts and Bern Congress Down. 



What is a One-termer?



A One-termer is any American citizen that is willing to uphold the following criteria:

A One-termer does not discriminate against any groups, based on religion, gender, party, race, and/or sexuality.
A One-termer willingly agrees, to run for one term at a time, and does not campaign for reelection during their term. They simple Clock in and work for the people
A One-termer truly represents their constituents
A One-termer is a proponent of transparent politics
A One-termer is the opposite of today’s bullshit politicians, a decent fucking human being.
A One-termer can be anyone.They are your waiters, professors, scientists, stand-up comedians, small business owners, poets, artists, satirical news show hosts, or celebrities. A One-termer is YOU.
What issues do One-termers focus on?
We believe if a candidate can uphold the previously mentioned core values, then they immediately have a more transparent and honest approach to politics than our current representatives; At the very least, they won't be as useless as our current congress (Approval rating of 10%)

Timeline





Dreaming is nice. Who doesn’t dream? Everywhere, eyery
moment we dream many things. This project was also a dream. And waited for more
than two years.




I’m a teacher. Science teacher. A teacher’s dream is just about
children. About their thoughts, feelings, moods… When you look into the eyes of a
child, you see the purity, sincerity, innocence to the finest details. This
project needs to be funded, because it will make you feel their worlds. 





As I said, I am a teacher. I'm trying to improve myself
constantly. I love to look at the flow of life. I love to produce, to create
something. I researched variety ways to satisfy my creation instinct. I got
this feeling and force, and the second time I finished university. I studied Photography
and Camera Operation in Anadolu University. I graduated from university in May
25, 2015 as high honour student with CGPA 3.89/4.00. (97.25/100) Here is my international
diploma supplement:















In Turkey, teachers’ salaries are less than $750. That’s why
this project really needs to be funded. I’ll buy necessary equipments for the
project with funds. Also i don’t want to realize this dream myself. For these
reasons i need for your help. When the project successfully completed, you will
receive bills of products with emails. Be a part of this dream.









The project will contain children that have different
socio-economic and cultural features.

                                                                         Routeplan
                                          




                                                    
The Eyes of Children Project wil start in Çorum,Turkey.
Çorum is a typical Central Anatolian city. In Çorum, you can find a general
expression about the majority of children in Turkey. So we’ll start there.


                                    
The second destination is Ankara,Turkey. As you know, Ankara

<p>Years ago (1999 - 2001), when I was studying Graphic Design, I volunteered in Maloka (<a href=""http://www.maloka.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.maloka.org</a>), an interactive museum whose main objective is to spread the science and technology to Bogotá's children through interaction with different modules that are designed by adults (I was one of them). In my experience, I learned that there are creative ways of teaching and appropriating science, technology to generate innovation.</p>
<p>Although Maloka is a great place to learn, there are limitations that prevent us from expanding the great purposes that are planned every day.</p>
<p>I think one of those drawbacks, is that the projects that are addressed there (are produced) require experts, scientists committed to the issues and a lot of money, therefore those magnificent ideas, are left in the pipeline looking for funding.</p>
<p>That problem led me to consider the idea of ​​venturing into politics. With the aim of achieving a better institutional participation of our Government in order to direct resources to the projects that were created in Maloka, I decided to leave the Graphic Design career and know the laws of our country, in order to understand how it is governed and Decisions are made. I studied laws.</p>
<p>As a lawyer, and while I was being trained, that idea has been fueled by more ideas. One of them is the creation of the FabLabs. Today, I work in Congress, close to the processes of creating laws and political force, I see increasingly distant the commitment of our governments to generate a public policy that leads to Colombia, especially its childhood, by the paths of science, technology and innovation.</p>
<p>However, Hope does not disappear. If our government can not, we, the citizens, can achieve it one step at a time. Therefore, it is time to take positive action to start spreading science with the help of technology and generate innovation in children.</p>
<p>Bogotá is a city of about 601,948 children between 4 and 14 years of age. They are wonderful years. Creativity and learning ability are at their best. As a community we must take advantage of that potential, in order to expand it so that our future will be more promising and, thus, gradually achieve the reduction of poverty, which hits the growth and development of our country, start to enter a valve of escape.</p>
<p>In Bogotá, Colombia, there are 3 commercial FabLab and 4 university students. These Bogota children do not have access to a FabLab. Although these spaces of experimentation were conceived for major minds, their essence (creating from nothing and empower the local communities) can be of better benefit in the hands of a child (of course, guided by a responsible and expert adult).</p>
<p>Can you imagine the potential of allowing a child to access a FabLab?</p>
<p>With your help we can take an action to promote a better future for the children of Bogotá, Colombia. Create a FabLab designed for children and used by children for children's learning.</p>
<p>Today we own a dream, which I share with you so that we can make it come true. As the campaign progresses, my commitment is to update better details about CREATINNO, the first FabLab for children in LatAm.</p>

I am from a poor family, my parents are simple farmers and we had very little already, but in 2013 we lost absolutely everything to the super typhoon Haiyan. It hit my town the hardest. Against all odds, my passion for education is so strong, I have successfully completed my college studies with two Bachelor degrees: Bachelor of Elementary Education &amp; Bachelor of Science in Nursing.</p><p> </p><p>[You can read my full story at the bottom.]</p><p> </p><p>Right now, I am working in Hong Kong as private nurse. My references are all really good, I am a diligent learner and hard worker. I have continued my education through workshops, books and online. While employed on a full-time contract, I still managed complete a course in Clinical Biotherapy on the side. So, on the paper, my chances look promising. I have the potential and will power to carry the responsibility for my whole family in the Philippines.</p><p> </p><p>I could push my education and career as Registered Nurse to this point. However, my opportunities for growth and further education in Hong Kong are very limited. I therefore want to go to Canada, continue education and work there. I am in touch with the Fanshawe college in Ontario and they would like to take me. I am now humbly asking for your support...</p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>My Goal</h3><p> </p><p>My plan and dear wish is to continue my study and work in Ontario/Canada. I chose the <a href=""https://www.fanshawec.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fanshawe College</a> for three reasons:</p><p> </p><p>1.) The study times can be aligned with a part time job that allows me to earn money while I am enrolled.</p><p> </p><p>2.) Their expertise with international students is impressive and they offer several scholarships of which I hope to get one to help me with costs for the second and third term.</p><p> </p><p>3.) They are well-connected with the healthcare industry and can be supportive in the post-graduation phase when I will look for permanent employment.</p><p> </p><h3>Why 6,000 USD</h3><p> </p><p>I plan to study the <strong><a href=""https://www.fanshawec.ca/programs-and-courses/program/psw9-personal-support-worker-weekend/next-year"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Personal Support Worker​ Program</a> </strong>starting in September 2018. The total mandatory fees and tuitions for this 1.5-year-study at Fanshawe are $16,708 Canadian Dollars = $13,008 USD. <i><strong>To get started, I need at least $6,078 USD:</strong></i> </p><p>I need to make a tuition down payment, get a visa and a mandatory health insurance for students.</p><p> </p><ul>
<li>Tuition down payment: $5,202 USD</li>
<li>Visa: $188 USD</li>
<li>Health Insurance: $688 USD</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>Ever since my childhood, I have always worked various jobs to keep myself running. So, I will also be able to cover my basic life expenses (food, place to stay, local transportation) by myself. I am furthermore allowed to take on a 20-h student job. I will also apply for a scholarship.</p><p> </p><h3>Why support me?</h3><p> </p><p><strong>I am a hard-working and very responsible person</strong> with a life-long passion for caring about others. I am eager to study to develop my skills more and enhance further knowledge so that I can provide better care to others: effectively and efficiently! So, when you help me with my professional education, your help will be going to many more people to which I can offer my care after graduation.</p><p> </p><p><strong>When you support me, you support an entire family at the same time:</strong> I have taken the responsibility to support my parents (farmers) too. Their health is declining, the days on the field in the hot sunshine are getting harder and harder for them. In February my mother passed out twice already. The family’s hope is on me.</p><p> </p><p><strong>I am honest.</strong> If you received this campaign link from a friend who met me in person, please ask them to give a testimonial about my character. They will confirm that I have strong values and integrity. I am a spiritual person, I believe in universal values like love and compassion. If you think alike, you may consider me a brother on the path, who you can support at bringing more love and compassion into this world.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>Rewards</h3><p> </p><p>Your generosity will return to you in many ways. That is my belief. My reward and promise to all of you is, that I will support another student one day. After I graduated and become financially stable, I will make a donation of at least 500.00 USD to a student in need.</p><p> </p><p>I am already providing free treatments on Sundays and I will continue to do so in Canada. Especially to impoverished or abandoned elderly. </p><p> </p><p>You will receive frequent updates from my life as a student on this campaign website, at least once per term.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>THANK YOU SO MUCH!</strong></p><p> </p><p>Please help to share my campaign with your families, friends and colleagues. Maybe you are willing to put the link to my campaign to your Facebook timeline, which would allow me to have greater exposure.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>With Love and Gratitude,</p><p> </p><p>Warel</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - </p><h3>My Story</h3><p> </p><p> </p><p>I always look forward rather than backward and I don’t know any self-pity, instead I am a solution oriented, positive thinking person. But I must mention my past to you, just to the extent that you can understand why my education means so incredibly much to me and my family and why I ask for your help with it.</p><p> </p><p>I am Warel Lopez. I come from Tacloban in the Philippines. My family still lives in this region.</p><p> </p><p>My parents are farmers with no education beyond elementary school, very little money, a small (and most simple) house and a field to grow vegetables.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>School</strong></p><p> </p><p>Since my childhood, I truly believe that education is the key to a good life. Even if it meant great sacrifice, pain and struggles… I would never stop learning. These challenges included: no food in school, no new school shoes and uniform, no school bag but only a plastic bag so I can carry my notebooks and no money for transportation. What I had only were notebook, pen and pencils and myself.</p><p> </p><p>At a very young age, I already understand what life is and the importance of education. Even without food, no money for transportation, I just sacrificed everyday so I can learn and acquire knowledge for my future. I only walked from our home to my school for a couple of kilometres away, which was crazy far for a child to walk without food.</p><p> </p><p>I never blamed my parents about the situation that we had. Not once. I really understood this already at a very young age: Yes, we are in poverty, but yet my parents are indeed hardworking and they do everything for the best of their children. So, I don’t mind what the people may say, what I care for is to get good education so I can help to uplift our economic status. I can really cross mountains just to have education…</p><p> </p><p>Looking back, I still had many wonderful experiences, though it was very hard. During elementary years, I already experienced working as a farmer, street vendor for fish and vegetable, pedicab driver and houseboy so we can just have food on the table.</p><p> </p><p>I studied and worked hard until I got my first elementary diploma. But then in high school, I experienced even higher levels of challenges. On top of the privations I experienced bullying. Teachers and students were laughing at me because my shoe was too old and too big for a little young boy. I did not give up my education, studied and worked hard and graduated from high school.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>College</strong></p><p> </p><p>There were more challenges when I was in college. My parents could not afford helping me with my schooling. I took the scholarship program from the Commission of Higher Education in the Philippines and the scholarship was granted. I could enrol and study!</p><p> </p><p>During university years, I only had 50 pesos or 1 USD every day which was for my transportation only, from our home going to college and back. I was always hungry, but I survived! Then after four years, I took the board exam for teachers and I made it.</p><p> </p><p>However my life challenges did not stop there. Even though I was already a professional teacher, I simply could not get a job. Instead of teaching, I worked as a construction labour, street vendor for food, driver and houseboy. In Spite of this crisis I never stopped dreaming big. I was still so thirsty for knowledge. Eventually, I decided to change my career: I took the academic scholarship program in the college of nursing at Colegio de Sta Lourdes of Leyte Foundation and passed this exam as well. The scholarship was granted.</p><p> </p><p>When I faced the challenges as a student and life inside the college of nursing, I thought I could not make it, because I had no money for the food in the canteen. My clinical instructor Mrs Eva Blesselda Astorga gave me an opportunity to continue: When she knew about my situation, she paid on my behalf. Silently. I could go on. A few months later, I worked a part-time job parallel to my study so I could support my miscellaneous expenses for the school. To tell you, I never experienced to own books ever since from elementary to my two bachelor degrees. Time passed, I graduated and became a registered nurse.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>After College</strong></p><p> </p><p>I was getting stronger inside and confident enough in facing any challenges in life. I went to Manila to look for a job as nurse but I experienced discrimination for my simple origin from the country side. I did not land on a job right away and once had nothing to eat for a whole week. I was crazy salivating whenever I smelled food. But I did not give up until I finally got a job. During daytime I worked as ESL teacher, in the nights I worked as a private nurse.</p><p> </p><p>Then in 2013, I got the chance to work abroad in Hong Kong as private nurse, so I went. While in Hong Kong, I encountered the biggest challenge in my life yet, when the super typhoon Haiyan landed and we lost our home and the little livelihood of my parents. This was the strongest and deadliest tropical storm in the history of my country - and it hit my very own home! There were dead bodies everywhere, the city totally destroyed and I had no news of my family for a week. I could not accept that so I went home to search them.

I am from a poor family, my parents are simple farmers and we had very little already, but in 2013 we lost absolutely everything to the super typhoon Haiyan. It hit my town the hardest. Against all odds, my passion for education is so strong, I have successfully completed my college studies with two Bachelor degrees: Bachelor of Elementary Education & Bachelor of Science in Nursing. [You can read my full story at the bottom.] Right now, I am working in Hong Kong as private nurse. My references are all really good, I am a diligent learner and hard worker. I have continued my education through workshops, books and online. While employed on a full-time contract, I still managed complete a course in Clinical Biotherapy on the side. So, on the paper, my chances look promising. I have the potential and will power to carry the responsibility for my whole family in the Philippines. I could push my education and career as Registered Nurse to this point. However, my opportunities for growth and further education in Hong Kong are very limited. I therefore want to go to Canada, continue education and work there. I am in touch with the Fanshawe college in Ontario and they would like to take me. I am now humbly asking for your support...  My Goal My plan and dear wish is to continue my study and work in Ontario/Canada. I chose the Fanshawe College for three reasons: 1.) The study times can be aligned with a part time job that allows me to earn money while I am enrolled. 2.) Their expertise with international students is impressive and they offer several scholarships of which I hope to get one to help me with costs for the second and third term. 3.) They are well-connected with the healthcare industry and can be supportive in the post-graduation phase when I will look for permanent employment. Why 6,000 USD I plan to study the Personal Support Worker​ Program starting in September 2018. The total mandatory fees and tuitions for this 1.5-year-study at Fanshawe are $16,708 Canadian Dollars = $13,008 USD. To get started, I need at least $6,078 USD: I need to make a tuition down payment, get a visa and a mandatory health insurance for students. 
Tuition down payment: $5,202 USD
Visa: $188 USD
Health Insurance: $688 USD
 Ever since my childhood, I have always worked various jobs to keep myself running. So, I will also be able to cover my basic life expenses (food, place to stay, local transportation) by myself. I am furthermore allowed to take on a 20-h student job. I will also apply for a scholarship. Why support me? I am a hard-working and very responsible person with a life-long passion for caring about others. I am eager to study to develop my skills more and enhance further knowledge so that I can provide better care to others: effectively and efficiently! So, when you help me with my professional education, your help will be going to many more people to which I can offer my care after graduation. When you support me, you support an entire family at the same time: I have taken the responsibility to support my parents (farmers) too. Their health is declining, the days on the field in the hot sunshine are getting harder and harder for them. In February my mother passed out twice already. The family’s hope is on me. I am honest. If you received this campaign link from a friend who met me in person, please ask them to give a testimonial about my character. They will confirm that I have strong values and integrity. I am a spiritual person, I believe in universal values like love and compassion. If you think alike, you may consider me a brother on the path, who you can support at bringing more love and compassion into this world.  Rewards Your generosity will return to you in many ways. That is my belief. My reward and promise to all of you is, that I will support another student one day. After I graduated and become financially stable, I will make a donation of at least 500.00 USD to a student in need. I am already providing free treatments on Sundays and I will continue to do so in Canada. Especially to impoverished or abandoned elderly.  You will receive frequent updates from my life as a student on this campaign website, at least once per term.  THANK YOU SO MUCH! Please help to share my campaign with your families, friends and colleagues. Maybe you are willing to put the link to my campaign to your Facebook timeline, which would allow me to have greater exposure.  With Love and Gratitude, Warel  - - - - - - - - - - - - My Story  I always look forward rather than backward and I don’t know any self-pity, instead I am a solution oriented, positive thinking person. But I must mention my past to you, just to the extent that you can understand why my education means so incredibly much to me and my family and why I ask for your help with it. I am Warel Lopez. I come from Tacloban in the Philippines. My family still lives in this region. My parents are farmers with no education beyond elementary school, very little money, a small (and most simple) house and a field to grow vegetables.  School Since my childhood, I truly believe that education is the key to a good life. Even if it meant great sacrifice, pain and struggles… I would never stop learning. These challenges included: no food in school, no new school shoes and uniform, no school bag but only a plastic bag so I can carry my notebooks and no money for transportation. What I had only were notebook, pen and pencils and myself. At a very young age, I already understand what life is and the importance of education. Even without food, no money for transportation, I just sacrificed everyday so I can learn and acquire knowledge for my future. I only walked from our home to my school for a couple of kilometres away, which was crazy far for a child to walk without food. I never blamed my parents about the situation that we had. Not once. I really understood this already at a very young age: Yes, we are in poverty, but yet my parents are indeed hardworking and they do everything for the best of their children. So, I don’t mind what the people may say, what I care for is to get good education so I can help to uplift our economic status. I can really cross mountains just to have education… Looking back, I still had many wonderful experiences, though it was very hard. During elementary years, I already experienced working as a farmer, street vendor for fish and vegetable, pedicab driver and houseboy so we can just have food on the table. I studied and worked hard until I got my first elementary diploma. But then in high school, I experienced even higher levels of challenges. On top of the privations I experienced bullying. Teachers and students were laughing at me because my shoe was too old and too big for a little young boy. I did not give up my education, studied and worked hard and graduated from high school.  College There were more challenges when I was in college. My parents could not afford helping me with my schooling. I took the scholarship program from the Commission of Higher Education in the Philippines and the scholarship was granted. I could enrol and study! During university years, I only had 50 pesos or 1 USD every day which was for my transportation only, from our home going to college and back. I was always hungry, but I survived! Then after four years, I took the board exam for teachers and I made it. However my life challenges did not stop there. Even though I was already a professional teacher, I simply could not get a job. Instead of teaching, I worked as a construction labour, street vendor for food, driver and houseboy. In Spite of this crisis I never stopped dreaming big. I was still so thirsty for knowledge. Eventually, I decided to change my career: I took the academic scholarship program in the college of nursing at Colegio de Sta Lourdes of Leyte Foundation and passed this exam as well. The scholarship was granted. When I faced the challenges as a student and life inside the college of nursing, I thought I could not make it, because I had no money for the food in the canteen. My clinical instructor Mrs Eva Blesselda Astorga gave me an opportunity to continue: When she knew about my situation, she paid on my behalf. Silently. I could go on. A few months later, I worked a part-time job parallel to my study so I could support my miscellaneous expenses for the school. To tell you, I never experienced to own books ever since from elementary to my two bachelor degrees. Time passed, I graduated and became a registered nurse.  After College I was getting stronger inside and confident enough in facing any challenges in life. I went to Manila to look for a job as nurse but I experienced discrimination for my simple origin from the country side. I did not land on a job right away and once had nothing to eat for a whole week. I was crazy salivating whenever I smelled food. But I did not give up until I finally got a job. During daytime I worked as ESL teacher, in the nights I worked as a private nurse. Then in 2013, I got the chance to work abroad in Hong Kong as private nurse, so I went. While in Hong Kong, I encountered the biggest challenge in my life yet, when the super typhoon Haiyan landed and we lost our home and the little livelihood of my parents. This was the strongest and deadliest tropical storm in the history of my country - and it hit my very own home! There were dead bodies everywhere, the city totally destroyed and I had no news of my family for a week. I could not accept that so I went home to search them. God bless, I found them and they were alive, but wet without shelter and without hope.We did not receive support from the government because of the reason that I am working abroad. This was so much painful for me. I cried a lot severely. I couldn’t do anything but accept the reality and move on. I tried my very best, worked day and night without breaks, 7 days a week... and now at least I can provide my parents to have a simple home to live. We can sleep without getting wet once it rains and have the most simple means to live. My parents today Future My big big dream is, to get a further education in Canada. I wish to study, work, live and contribute in the country where people are treated the same and where your hard work can lead to success. Your support will make a tremendous change in my life and means the world to my family. I will never put your help in vain. Thank you and God bless us always.  Warel",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

She decided to set up a daycare that could accomodate children aged 6-24 months so as to offer reprieve to such parents, bridge the market gap & still be a mother to her child.  The significance of you contributionBy contributing to this campaign you'll help us combine passion (motherhood & caregiving) with enterprenuership as we help families raise their babies while they make ends meet.What happens if we dont reach my goal?If, unfortunately we don't reach our goal backers will get to choose which cause/charity/campaign to donate the proceeds to.Our objective for this campaign.We plan to open a modern daycare center which caters for the holistic needs of every child. Image courtesy of : www.bestonedesign.comWith the current financial crisis, especially in most developing countries (Kenya included) young parents would appreciate a little help raising their little ones as they try to make ends meet. Early stages of a child's development is vital. As the world strives to invest in ECD, we'll try to offer my expertise as ECD teachers & Caregivers. Previous ProjectThe founder worked as a volunteer assistant graduate  (VGA) with the G-UNITED Programme (KE) in partnership with Evidence Action, whereby she helped improve literacy levels for struggling learners in G1-G3. Also, together with a co- VGA  they started an initiative under the name G-gundue Initiative. Its aim was to educate locals on the importance of girl-child education & the danger of early pregnancies & forced marriages for under-aged girls.The OutcomeWe're aware that not all campaigns reach their target & not everybody is a giver. A comment, referralor a word of encouragement is also welcome. We're looking for philanthropists willing to part with $1. Are you passionate about Early Childhood development? This is the campaign for you.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p style=""text-align: center;"">So you might be asking, <strong>how can I meditate and learn Spanish at the same time?</strong> First of all, meditation is a natural cognitive enhancer. It doesn’t always have to be you sitting in silence on your yoga mat. It can actually be something that is a reflective experience. This is why we developed a <strong>“mind active”</strong> method for our guided meditations.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Most meditations are focused on being body passive / mind passive. You relax your mind and body and go into a deeper meditative state, almost to the point where you fall asleep. Your pulse slows, your mind slows, and your body becomes slower and more mindful.</p>

<p>Hello backers. I am Ling. I was born and raised in a small farming village in mainland China. Growing up, I didn't have any toys or electronics, life was about going to school, working on our farm, it was very quiet and peaceful.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1623644063/xbw6i7mq9jooix9qq8v1.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>On my fifth birthday, my uncle who worked in the city gifted me with a radio. I fell in love with it immediately. It was my first window to the outside world.  Every night after finishing all my school and housework, I would lay in bed holding my precious radio and listening to all the daily news and stories. My favorite part was the music program, which always came at the end of the night, but I always waited for it. <strong>Music was like magic, it soothed all my tiredness, calmed my soul, painted a colorful picture of the bigger world that I dreamt to see, and it also taught me many songs</strong>. I began to sing and hum all day long, on my way to school, herding animals, cooking, cleaning... When I was happy, singing made everything even brighter. When I was sad, singing offered me comfort and peace. Even though I was not good at singing, I loved every minute of it. Little did I know then, that radio, music, and singing would change my life drastically. <strong>It encouraged me to be brave and adventurous, it inspired me to step out of my little village, explore and embrace all the adventures. </strong></p>
<p>Fast forwarded 30 years later, I graduated college with multiple degrees, traveled around the world, and have settled in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. I now have two little ones, my daughter Miao Miao (Chinese for ""little fire"")/Ember (her English name) is almost three years old. My son Ran Ran (Chinese for ""rising"")/Ezran (his English name) is a year old. As I have been exploring this new chapter of my life as a mama, I find myself singing again, the same songs I learned from the radio when I was a child. Singing and dancing with my children has become our favorite activity together. Not only has it bonded us closer, but it also sparked my children's interest in learning Chinese.<strong> I cannot help but feeling proud when Miao Miao points things out everywhere she goes and ask me ""Mama, what's this in Chinese?""  This love and joy were what inspired me to create this book, ""Sing along with Miao Miao"". </strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1623644182/b4rcyce3uzkocspic4fn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> It has our favorite songs from both China and America, it sings in Mandarin Chinese, with both English, Chinese, and Pinyin (the alphabetical pronunciation) lyrics. Even if you do not know any Chinese, you can still sing along with your little one following Pinyin. I hope this book can help my kids and kids everywhere learn Chinese while having fun singing.</p>

<p>In the process of making this book, there were many challenges.  Such as finding the right artist for our illustrations, and fixing the battery problem.  Luckily, we were able to find solutions and overcome all the challenges in the end. What kept me going forward and stopped me from giving up was all the help and support from my dear family and friends. Also, it is my dream to share this with all of you around the world, and my belief that it will bring joy and happiness to you and your little ones. This book is my way to share my childhood memories with my children, and I hope it will spark inspiration for all parents.  <strong>Let's be proud of where we came from, let's celebrate the journey we had to take to get here today, let’s share that with our children, and connect them back to our roots in any way we can.   </strong></p>
<p>With the help from some wonderful friends and many months of hard work; finally, I was able to make a sample book this month. Everyone who has seen it fell in love with it, and they all asked me when they can get a copy. However, as I am a stay-at-mom right now without an income, finances have become a big roadblock in moving forward. I am very grateful that I can share my story and create this campaign here, and I am hoping it will help me complete this journey. Right now, we need $10,000 to get the book published and for sale which includes $5,000 for book production and $5,000 for packaging and shipping. <strong>To show our deepest gratitude, all backers will get a 32% discount on the book's original price, plus free shipping. Backers will also get the book as soon as they are produced (in early July) before official publication. Even if we don't reach our entire goal by the due date, the funds will still go to book production.  Every effort will be put into publishing this book. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Any help you can offer us, no matter big or small, will all be greatly appreciated. Even if you cannot contribute, we understand, you can still help us by sharing our campaign using the Indiegogo share tools.</strong> We thank you all very much for your time and consideration. Thank you for helping to make my dream come true and making a difference in the world.  </p>

On my fifth birthday, my uncle who worked in the city gifted me with a radio. I fell in love with it immediately. It was my first window to the outside world.  Every night after finishing all my school and housework, I would lay in bed holding my precious radio and listening to all the daily news and stories. My favorite part was the music program, which always came at the end of the night, but I always waited for it. Music was like magic, it soothed all my tiredness, calmed my soul, painted a colorful picture of the bigger world that I dreamt to see, and it also taught me many songs. I began to sing and hum all day long, on my way to school, herding animals, cooking, cleaning... When I was happy, singing made everything even brighter. When I was sad, singing offered me comfort and peace. Even though I was not good at singing, I loved every minute of it. Little did I know then, that radio, music, and singing would change my life drastically. It encouraged me to be brave and adventurous, it inspired me to step out of my little village, explore and embrace all the adventures. 
Fast forwarded 30 years later, I graduated college with multiple degrees, traveled around the world, and have settled in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. I now have two little ones, my daughter Miao Miao (Chinese for ""little fire"")/Ember (her English name) is almost three years old. My son Ran Ran (Chinese for ""rising"")/Ezran (his English name) is a year old. As I have been exploring this new chapter of my life as a mama, I find myself singing again, the same songs I learned from the radio when I was a child. Singing and dancing with my children has become our favorite activity together. Not only has it bonded us closer, but it also sparked my children's interest in learning Chinese. I cannot help but feeling proud when Miao Miao points things out everywhere she goes and ask me ""Mama, what's this in Chinese?""  This love and joy were what inspired me to create this book, ""Sing along with Miao Miao"". 

 It has our favorite songs from both China and America, it sings in Mandarin Chinese, with both English, Chinese, and Pinyin (the alphabetical pronunciation) lyrics. Even if you do not know any Chinese, you can still sing along with your little one following Pinyin. I hope this book can help my kids and kids everywhere learn Chinese while having fun singing.


In the process of making this book, there were many challenges.  Such as finding the right artist for our illustrations, and fixing the battery problem.  Luckily, we were able to find solutions and overcome all the challenges in the end. What kept me going forward and stopped me from giving up was all the help and support from my dear family and friends. Also, it is my dream to share this with all of you around the world, and my belief that it will bring joy and happiness to you and your little ones. This book is my way to share my childhood memories with my children, and I hope it will spark inspiration for all parents.  Let's be proud of where we came from, let's celebrate the journey we had to take to get here today, let’s share that with our children, and connect them back to our roots in any way we can.   
With the help from some wonderful friends and many months of hard work; finally, I was able to make a sample book this month. Everyone who has seen it fell in love with it, and they all asked me when they can get a copy. However, as I am a stay-at-mom right now without an income, finances have become a big roadblock in moving forward. I am very grateful that I can share my story and create this campaign here, and I am hoping it will help me complete this journey. Right now, we need $10,000 to get the book published and for sale which includes $5,000 for book production and $5,000 for packaging and shipping. To show our deepest gratitude, all backers will get a 32% discount on the book's original price, plus free shipping. Backers will also get the book as soon as they are produced (in early July) before official publication. Even if we don't reach our entire goal by the due date, the funds will still go to book production.  Every effort will be put into publishing this book. 
Any help you can offer us, no matter big or small, will all be greatly appreciated. Even if you cannot contribute, we understand, you can still help us by sharing our campaign using the Indiegogo share tools. We thank you all very much for your time and consideration. Thank you for helping to make my dream come true and making a difference in the world.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Programa
is an easy to use software tool that combines a simple, yet powerful programming
language with an intuitive user interface. 
Programa’s computing environment is ideal for anyone who wants to learn computer
programming. Programa was built to minimize the time it takes someone to
understand writing and debugging computer programs. In addition, its powerful
visualization tools allow you to produce exciting graphs and plots so you can
easily explore the results of your project. </p>
<h3><b>Why
….</b></h3>
<p>Today
there are no software programming tools designed to make it easy for everyone to learn how to program. Most entry-level tools are too simple to provide
beginners with a deep understanding of programming and not powerful enough to develop
meaningful, functional computer programs. 
At the same time, most professional programming tools are too complicated
and discourage, rather than encourage, people to attempt to learn programming. </p>
<p>Programa
bridges this gap by using a template-based coding style, with integrated
learning concepts, instant feedback on code errors, and program monitoring to
create an environment where you can easily create and test a computer program. Programa
gives users instant gratification.</p>
<h3><b>How
Programa came to life …..</b></h3>
<p>There are so many
different software packages and programming languages … virtually something
different for every application. With so many options out there, how does one decide even where to start
their programming journey<b>? This is programming chaos.</b></p>
<p>We
relied on our many years of software experience and our deep understanding of many
of these environments and languages to find a better way. We started with a blank
sheet of paper. From there, we used best practices, features, and capabilities
of the leading programming environments and languages as insights for Programa and
then added new features to improve ease-of-use and the best possible user
experience. Programa represents a radical change that will help you and your
children quickly and easily understand how to program and communicate with
computers.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>What’s
next ...</b></h3>
<p>Now that
the basics of Programa have been built, we plan to optimize the user interface,
test, and bring Programa to you.  We need
your help to make this happen. We want you to be a part of bringing Programa to
market.</p>

<p>Computer science education is essential for all children to succeed in an ever challenging and competitive working environment. Most of the schools today do not teach computer science …. this must change. Want to change this and add computer science to your school’s existing curriculum? If you are one of the few where computer science classes are implemented, wouldn’t it be great to have a tool that can improve participation and success of your students? Want to give your students a new path to future success?  Programa provides an easy transition from the simple block-based programming methods to full-fledged programming environments in a fun and easy environment.  Programa is designed to make sure children are successful when they try increasingly complex computer programming projects.<br/></p>

<p>I want to reverse the usual politic perspective: I want to start from the territory with revolutionary politic.

<p>Con la politica tradizionale!</p>
<p>Ma la politica è per la società e mi batterò finche un qualche tipo di società resisterà su queste montagne, cercando di trovare un modo per sopravvivere quassù.</p>
<p>Voglio invertire la solita prospettiva politica: voglio iniziare dal territorio con una politica rivoluzionaria. Non una filosofia (conservatori o laburisti, sinistra o destra, nero o rosso), ma un ambiente saranno al centro. Dove vivo io la natura è così forte che dobbiamo considerare che sia ella a guidare la nostra decisione politica.</p>
<p>Voglio creare un sito web che lavora come una piazza virtuale per consentire che le associazioni, le aziende agricole, le fabbriche, le aziende, i sindaci e tutti i portatori di interesse possono trovare ogni-altro.

What our territory is! (Cos'è il nostro territorio!)
Watch the picture and you will understand. This is only a part (the Misurina lake) of a  UNESCO world heritage called Dolomiti!
But... here we've got a very big problem from the hardness of the life in the highlands: nothing helps us from the rest of the country. No specific laws, no moneyfavors, no helpfull conditions, no roads develop, no railways, no broadband web... nothing from Italy!

We live in a nature paradise, that's becoming a hell for a modern life-style! 
(Guardate la foto e capirete. Questa è solo una parte (il lago di Misurina) di un patrimonio mondiale dell'UNESCO denominato Dolomiti!
Ma ... qui abbiamo un problema molto grande dovuto dalla durezza della vita nelle Highlands: nessuno aiuto dal resto del paese. Senza leggi specifiche, senza vantaggi economici, senza condizioni di favore, senza sviluppo stradale, senza ferrovie, senza banda larga web ... niente dall'Italia!
Viviamo in un paradiso naturale, che sta diventando un inferno per un moderno stile di vita!)
   What We Need & What You Get (Cosa ci serve e cosa tu puoi dare) We tried so much with traditional politic untill we lost hopes.
With the traditional politics! 
Politics is for society and I will fight untill a kind of society will be up this mountains trying to find a way to survive. 
I want to reverse the usual politic perspective: I want to start from the territory with revolutionary politic. Not a philosophy (tory or labour, left or right, black or red) but an enviroment will be in the center. In my place the nature is so strong that we must consider it to guide our political decision.  I want to create a web-site working like a virtual square to let the associations, the farms, the factories, the companies, the mayors and all the stake-holders could find each-others. They will find other mountaniers and they'll tell them what they do and what they need: because unity is strenght! 
I also want to promote it seriously on local media.  I think this project is strong because wants to create a lobby from a whole small fragile territory for the territory. The steps are: 4000eur to create a good web platform, 10000eur of advertisment and promotion, 1000eur in a possible prize for you. 
(Abbiamo provato tanto con politica tradizionale fino a che abbiamo perso le speranze.
Con la politica tradizionale!
Ma la politica è per la società e mi batterò finche un qualche tipo di società resisterà su queste montagne, cercando di trovare un modo per sopravvivere quassù.
Voglio invertire la solita prospettiva politica: voglio iniziare dal territorio con una politica rivoluzionaria. Non una filosofia (conservatori o laburisti, sinistra o destra, nero o rosso), ma un ambiente saranno al centro. Dove vivo io la natura è così forte che dobbiamo considerare che sia ella a guidare la nostra decisione politica.
Voglio creare un sito web che lavora come una piazza virtuale per consentire che le associazioni, le aziende agricole, le fabbriche, le aziende, i sindaci e tutti i portatori di interesse possono trovare ogni-altro. Troveranno altri montanari e faranno dire loro quello che fanno e di cui hanno bisogno: perché l'unità fa la forza!
Voglio anche promuovere seriamente sui media locali questo progetto.
Penso che sia un'idea vincente perché vuole creare una lobby da un piccolo territorio fragile per il territorio stesso.
I passi sono: 4000eur per creare una buona piattaforma web, 10000eur di pubblicità e promozione, 1000euro in premio possibile per te).
   The Impact (Gli effetti) Your contribution will help to give to our territory one more chance to live.   It will let the people from this wonderful mountains  to stay here... ...because a place with no people living there is just for some explorers!

<p><b>We have not changed enough to prevent a WW3</b></p>
<p>I’m worried
about a rising tension in the world and we see tragic events one after another. The tension is similar to WW2.<br/>
Left vs Right are fighting. Racists vs non-racists. Truth vs lies. 
Terrorist vs the people. Goverment vs the people. Corporations vs the 
people.

<br/>Since we spend more time on the internet, and not debating in real life, we have to create a platform where we can communicate properly and discuss ideas. It’s not about accepting different opinions, but respecting the individual
behind it. <br/> <br/><b>The current forums are not designed for debate</b>:<br/> Twitter, comment section or forums. <br/><br/>They are needed, but we need to add something else. Where you communicate with one person. In a safe and non-judgemental-zone with people who can guide your debate. All done in a tool, designed like a game with the latest knowledge in communication and psychology.<br/><p><br/></p>

</div></div>","Campaign ended - we will try again with new energy and force!Thank you!We have three tools that we, boldly, believe will be as valuable as Wikipedia.
""Wikideas"", ""Understanding"" and ""Comment changer - stop the hate""This is a communication platform that will reduce hate, radicalization and polarization by using the latest knowledge in psychology and communication.  SVENSK VERSION HÄR (Swedish version) 




You want to do good right? That feeling when you help someone? What if you could do it all the time whenever you want?
We want to make it EASY, FUN and ENGAGING to make the world a little better place!

BACKGROUND - NOW OR NEVER
We have not changed enough to prevent a WW3
I’m worried
about a rising tension in the world and we see tragic events one after another. The tension is similar to WW2.
Left vs Right are fighting. Racists vs non-racists. Truth vs lies. 
Terrorist vs the people. Goverment vs the people. Corporations vs the 
people. 

We must act
now and spread understanding between these groups! Spread peace! Spread respect! 

Also secure the right to free speech in times like these.
 “I don’t fear any feelings, ideas or thoughts -
I only the fear of those who are not trying to understand them."" -Captain Free


As you saw in the video when I chased the thief, I didn't judge him for stealing,     I kept my respect for him. I asked questions. I tried to understand his situation.  Did you see how he started to change? 
We are all ""evil"" and ""good"", no one is just one of those.
He has been labeled forever, and when someone finally removes that label, he also removes it from himself. When someone finally see his suffering, he take off his armor and become vulnerable and open for change.
If we can't be vulnerable - we build armor and weapons.


This campaign is important not only for us, but for the future of our kids.

PROBLEM RIGHT NOW:


(Everyone is blindfolded and is trying to see the elephant by just looking or touching at one part - you can't get the whole picture)



TOOL 1 - Understanding



The most important thing right now is to have our ideas challenged with respect. This tool can and will be used against radicalization and hate.We have to REWARD people for testing their and try new perspective. NOT punish them and call them ""Evil"" or ""Bad"".The tools will be available in the browser and will eventually become available as an app.
WHY IT'S NEEDED:




WHY YOU WILL LOVE IT:

A site where no one will bully you in a debate - they will all try to understand you


Be heard, understood, respected, accepted and acknowledged no matter what you think. 
Make the world a better place whenever you want by trying to understand!

Since we spend more time on the internet, and not debating in real life, we have to create a platform where we can communicate properly and discuss ideas. It’s not about accepting different opinions, but respecting the individual
behind it.  The current forums are not designed for debate: Twitter, comment section or forums. They are needed, but we need to add something else. Where you communicate with one person. In a safe and non-judgemental-zone with people who can guide your debate. All done in a tool, designed like a game with the latest knowledge in communication and psychology.
We know it works because it's based upon ""non-violent-communication"" which is a proven successful way for understanding each other with thousands of practitioners worldwide.



Uniqueness

Live
Debate about a topic OR explore one person's idea (racist, terrorist or X)

Three communicators – A, B and C (active observers)

Three phases for each debate - Question phase, perspective phase and open phase (and many more)

Emotional+rational thinking

In a non-political-correct & non-judgemental-zone



HOW IT WORKS
Subject chosen – you are matched with up with another communicator and observers. You go through the different phases. The aim is not to “win” a debate, it’s to get the most understanding points. 
GOAL: Understanding between groups, people and ideas.





EFFECT


Less hate
More understanding
More peace
More respect
More love
Truth will be prevail

I'm 100% sure it can prevent a violent conflict, maybe even the lead up to murder and even mass shootings.
TOOL 2: COMMENT CHANGER - STOP THE HATE (stretch goal): 

Thousands of comments are publicized every second. In the newspaper you can almost read daily about someone being hurt by hate. And it can be directed towards anyone.
Some even decide to take their life because of net bullying and hate. 
The tool ""Understanding"" is a long-term and proactive solution.                                          This is a short-term and reactive solution.
We believe it has to do with being irrational, too easy to comment, frustration and a form of ventilation from one's own problem.
So we wish to create a sort of eco system with comments.You can either FIND comments and clarify them. Or you can take your OWN comment and turn into a constructive comment.

<p>MyLanguage.Pro will be a new website attracting only the highest quality qualified and experienced tutors, thereby guaranteeing students a higher quality learning experience and better results. </p>
<p><u><strong>The Current Problems:</strong></u></p>
<p>Current online websites do not verify teachers qualifications sufficiently. This leads to students having little control over the standard of teaching.</p>
<p>In addition tutors are charged an exorbitant commission (15% by the larger providers). This leads to the best tutors leaving current websites and both new students being unable to find them, whilst simultaneously these tutors being unable to find new students!</p>
<p><strong><u>The Solution:</u></strong></p>
<p>MyLanguage.Pro will solve these problems and serve both students and tutors better by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lowering the commission charged by major sites from 15% to 4.85% (ie less than 1/3 of current commissions). This will encourage the best tutors to migrate to MyLanguage.Pro and make them far more likely to remain as they will receive quality reviews generating more students.</li>
<li>Vetting both the quality and quality of teachers more thoroughly:<ul>
<li>Checking the existence of schools to make sure they exist</li>
<li>Requiring that qualifications are verifiable</li>
<li>Requiring that tutors migrating from other sites have the highest ratings possible on these other sites from students, guaranteeing lesson quality.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><u><strong>The Result:</strong></u></p>
<ul>
<li>Students will be happier with the teaching results thereby leaving higher quality reviews.</li>
<li>This will encourage more potential students to have greater faith in booking a tutor, thereby serving tutors better.</li>
<li>This will encourage tutors to stay on the site, thereby further encouraging students to trust the reputation of this site and visit it.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this way a virtuous cycle is created. Both students and tutors are happier, increasing the brand power of the MyLanguage.Pro. More tutors continue to be attracted by the better incentive and therefore can serve more students who are served better than on other sites, further engaging to religion of MyLanguage.Pro. </p>
<p><strong><u>My Experience:</u></strong></p>
<p>I am both a teacher and a student on these sites and I recognise that both groups could be served with much greater satisfaction for much less cost.</p>
<p>I also have a Master in Business Administration, with over 20 years experience in advising in and setting up new businesses, including web based businesses.</p>
<p><u><strong>Your Contributions: </strong></u></p>
<p>Your contributions will go directly to developing the website portal, setting up the company structure and initial online marketing costs. Your contributions will make it possible to establish a website that provides higher quality tutors that takes far lower commissions.</p>
<p><u><strong>What You Get:</strong></u></p>
<p>I recognise that incentives must be what you want for the site to work. My incentives serve both students and tutors.</p>
<p>The incentives will discount lessons on the site. Large pledges will offer express assessment for potential tutors. </p>
<p><u><strong>How Pledges will be Spent:</strong></u></p>
<ul>
<li>Website development costs: €1200</li>
<li>Website domain and hosting costs: €180</li>
<li>Online marketing costs: €2500</li>
<li>Photography for website and promotional video: €650</li>
<li>Company set-up costs  in Hong Kong: € 950</li>
<li>Crowdfunding site costs: €603</li>
<li>Crowdfunding reserved funds (to also be used for online marketing when released): €274</li>
<li>Crowdfunding Transfer fee:€25</li>
</ul>

<p><u><strong>The Risks and Challenges:</strong></u></p>
<p>The risks are:</p>
<ul>
<li>That the website is not developed quickly and correctly: I have a developer with a very good reputation for delivery. Their ratings are public, so I have great faith in their ability to deliver. I have developed a number of websites previously and am familiar with how to choose a good developer, as well as how to work with them to achieve the desired result. </li>
<li>Marketing costs insufficient: similar projects in the past have had very similar online marketing costs. As more students are attracted to the site, some of that revenue will be used to fund ongoing online marketing. </li>
<li>Attracting teachers to the site: with a commission for tutors of less than 1/3 of the major sites at present, tutors will want to use the site. </li>
<li>Attracting students to the site: as we will only accept tutors with verified qualifications and high satisfaction ratings, students will be on average, much more satisfied. They will be much more likely to stay on the site.</li>
</ul>
</div></div>","MyLanguage.Pro will be a new website attracting only the highest quality qualified and experienced tutors, thereby guaranteeing students a higher quality learning experience and better results. 
The Current Problems:
Current online websites do not verify teachers qualifications sufficiently. This leads to students having little control over the standard of teaching.
In addition tutors are charged an exorbitant commission (15% by the larger providers). This leads to the best tutors leaving current websites and both new students being unable to find them, whilst simultaneously these tutors being unable to find new students!
The Solution:
MyLanguage.Pro will solve these problems and serve both students and tutors better by:

Lowering the commission charged by major sites from 15% to 4.85% (ie less than 1/3 of current commissions). This will encourage the best tutors to migrate to MyLanguage.Pro and make them far more likely to remain as they will receive quality reviews generating more students.
Vetting both the quality and quality of teachers more thoroughly:
Checking the existence of schools to make sure they exist
Requiring that qualifications are verifiable
Requiring that tutors migrating from other sites have the highest ratings possible on these other sites from students, guaranteeing lesson quality.



The Result:

Students will be happier with the teaching results thereby leaving higher quality reviews.
This will encourage more potential students to have greater faith in booking a tutor, thereby serving tutors better.
This will encourage tutors to stay on the site, thereby further encouraging students to trust the reputation of this site and visit it.

In this way a virtuous cycle is created. Both students and tutors are happier, increasing the brand power of the MyLanguage.Pro. More tutors continue to be attracted by the better incentive and therefore can serve more students who are served better than on other sites, further engaging to religion of MyLanguage.Pro. 
My Experience:
I am both a teacher and a student on these sites and I recognise that both groups could be served with much greater satisfaction for much less cost.
I also have a Master in Business Administration, with over 20 years experience in advising in and setting up new businesses, including web based businesses.
Your Contributions: 
Your contributions will go directly to developing the website portal, setting up the company structure and initial online marketing costs. Your contributions will make it possible to establish a website that provides higher quality tutors that takes far lower commissions.
What You Get:
I recognise that incentives must be what you want for the site to work. My incentives serve both students and tutors.
The incentives will discount lessons on the site. Large pledges will offer express assessment for potential tutors. 
How Pledges will be Spent:

Website development costs: €1200
Website domain and hosting costs: €180
Online marketing costs: €2500
Photography for website and promotional video: €650
Company set-up costs  in Hong Kong: € 950
Crowdfunding site costs: €603
Crowdfunding reserved funds (to also be used for online marketing when released): €274
Crowdfunding Transfer fee:€25

Total = €6382
Also, note - if we don’t reach our funding goals then the funding will be used in the following order:

The crowdfunding site costs
Domain costs
Website development costs,
Then company setup costs,
Online marketing costs

Of course all contributions will be deeply appreciated. Any amount will help us achieve our goal in providing the highest quality online language leaning site in the world. 
Other Ways to Help:
We’d also love it if you could spread the word to your friends and colleagues who may be able to help. 
The Risks and Challenges:
The risks are:

<h3>About Buildy Bots</h3>
<p>First imagined as UARO (Kid Robot) by RoboRobo, it was the first hands-on coding toy in South Korea. By creating an off-the-computer coding device, young children could build their creativity, hone their fine-motor skills, learn physical computing, and develop 21st century skills, all while playing.</p>
<p>For its North American debut, RoboRobo has partnered with Robolink, inc., renaming UARO to Buildy Bots, because this kit is perfect for little hands to build lots of robots!</p>

<h2>About Robolink</h2>
<p>Robolink was established in 2012 in San Diego, California to encourage students to engage with STEM. Our mission is to make STEM education accessible, engaging, and fun. The world is becoming more technology-driven, so it’s increasingly important that we cultivate the next generation of innovators and inventors and make technology accessible to all. We were the first to make a programmable educational drone as well as a self-driving car kit that teaches artificial intelligence.</p>
<h2>Risks and challenges</h2>
<p>Most of the risks and challenges are behind us. We have completed three successful Kickstarter projects (CoDrone, Zumi, and Rokit Smart,). Our team of educational specialists poured their lives into designing these kits and have been a huge success in Korea. Throughout the testing phase, we worked to perfect the kits based on the feedback of the users. These users had a blast working with our prototypes and were able to create some absolutely incredible robots. And now, Buildy Bots is ready for you. It's for boys and girls, ages 5-10, and all it's going to take is your support.</p>
<p>At this point, there is just two hurdles left:</p>
<p>Production: Many of the parts in this kit and curriculum are localized. We have very exacting standards, so creating the molds and manufacturing the components can be very expensive. Thankfully, we have identified some top-tier factory partners who can produce our kits with a very quick turnaround time.</p>
<p>In order to bring the cost down to an affordable amount, we have to order at least 1,000 kits from the manufacturer. To get there, we are counting on you. Pledge right now and we will put you on the list to be one of the first to receive a Buildy Bots kit so your child can start on their adventure in building and off-the -computer coding!</p>
<p>Shipping Risk: Global shipping and warehousing logistics is mind-boggling. We have been working with our shipping partner for a decade and now that logistics is going back to normal, we are really confident to achieve our goal and ship all backers in time.</p>
<p>Things can still go awry. If they do, we solemnly promise to give you full transparency into the issues and solve them in a way that leaves our backers happy and proud to support our company.</p>
</div></div>","Zero-screen time coding!
Buildy Bots coding board uses short-distance wireless technology(NFC) paired with coding blocks. This means coding can happen, without a computer or device! 
Each block represents an action that when placed in sequential order, will create simple to complex programs. Best of all, the blocks use pictures so coding can happen without reading.

 
Buildy Bots Ages Up With Your Child
Starting at age 5, children can build simple machines, but as their fine motor skills develop, Buildy Bots will grow up with them! Build remote controlled robots, code sensors, and collaborate on new inventions!

</p><p><b>Our Mission: </b></p>
<p>Our mission is to encourage
independent and successful spellers who are empowered by their own ability to
spell words correctly without relying upon spell-check technology. </p>
<p><b>Our Story:</b></p>
<p>Hello! My name is
Olivia Kasper.  I am a college sophomore and entrepreneur from
Alpharetta, GA. When I was nine years old, I developed a spelling tool called Spell-A-Cadabra
to help myself learn how to spell without rote-memorization because I was such
a terrible speller.  Spell-A-Cadabra is a
unique, child-friendly, three-step spelling tool that initiates analytical
thinking and can be used anywhere.  By
the time I was 16, I had conducted two professional, research studies with over
200 students.  Not only did I prove that my
tool could be used with any spelling curriculum to help kids spell much better,
I also discovered that the students using my tool remembered their spelling
words long after their spelling tests!  The success that Spell-A-Cadabra brought
each child was so exciting with an average improvement of an entire letter
grade, and words that were remembered over a month later!  After seeing how well these 200 students
responded to Spell-A-Cadabra, I have made it my mission to get it into the
hands of as many children as possible.</p>
<p><b>What we Stand for:</b></p>
<p>Finally mastering my
spelling words was such a personal relief and affected me in such a positive
way, that I want to share my tool with as many other students as possible.  By using my method, before I knew it my spelling
in general had improved (not just my weekly tests) because I began to “think”
about the letters in a word, instead of trying to “remember” what I had tried
to memorize.  </p>
<p>I believe every child
deserves the opportunity to excel educationally, and in life.  Since reading, writing, and spelling are all
intertwined, if one area is strengthened the others benefit.  I want every child to have access to a
Spell-A-Cadabra kit, in hopes that they struggle less in school and achieve a
new level of self-confidence.  <b>The Spell-A-Cadabra Campaign strives to
ignite a strong foundation of educational brilliance within each child.</b>  For every Spell-A-Cadabra perk sold,
Spell-A-Cadabra kits will be donated to children, classrooms, schools, or
organizations, at no cost to the recipient.  Our goal is to start by contributing to
children in the pre-k through third grade.  With the help of our
supporters, we can immediately enhance a child’s self esteem as well as
academic confidence and success.  </p>
<p><b>Give a Little Get a Lot: </b></p>
<p>The spark of an individual
is nothing compared to the flame of a group. </p>
<p>Our goal for this
campaign is to raise a minimum of $250,000 dollars.  Our production costs are low, so every penny
donated to us goes a long way helping to make a huge impact quickly.  Our pledge streamlines our proceeds directly
towards the continued production of the original version of Spell-A-Cadabra<b>,</b> the 8” by 11”, dry-erase form of our
spelling tool, that allows children to take it “on the go” and learn anywhere.  </p>
<p>We are also excited
to serve our recipients who have questions about the Spell-A-Cadabra tool with
an online Spell-A-Cadabra Resource Center, designed
to answer questions about the product and provide personal assistance. We will also use some of the proceeds to convert our website into an iPhone and Android cellphone friendly platform. </p>
<p>The “giving”
opportunities are endless, and we are hoping that classroom teachers and
parents alike will rally their children to begin helping other classrooms
across the USA! </p>
<p><b>Our Perks:</b></p>
<p><span>
For every donation made,
contributors receive our popular “SpellStrong” wristband, and their own
Spell-A-Cadabra kit.  In addition, a matching kit will be donated to a school on
their behalf.  Depending upon the
contribution level, rewards get added to the initial perk.  The best part is that as the levels increase so
do the number of children who receive kits! 
Other unique perks include cool squish balls, hip tumblers, and
fashionable tee’s. Top level contributors receive a commemorative, framed
certificate that can be displayed in classrooms to </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">encourage and remind

the production of original Spell-A-Cadabras, and the Spell-A-Cadabra Student

possible. </p>
<p><b>The Impact:</b></p>
<p>There is nothing like
the infectious spirit of doing something kind to help someone!  </p><p>There is a humble healing that the giver and
the receiver both get that makes the world a more compassionate place.  I
believe that thankfulness is contagious and when people are thankful, they too
are more likely to pass the goodness forward.  <b>Contributors
of this campaign are voluntarily helping to give back to the overall educational
wellbeing of our nation’s children</b>. Through the donations and enthusiasm of
contributors this campaign will shine an essential spotlight on the educational
importance of each child, while getting the actual Spell-A-Cadabras into the
hands of students much quicker than I could manage independently.  Sponsors will create lifelong positive change
in their local schools, their community and our country with improved learning, better
test scores and higher graduation rates. 
Ultimately, we have faith that this will extend into successful employment
with global merit. </p>
<p><b>We “Gotta” Start Somewhere: </b></p>
<p>This is the first
Spell-A-Cadabra Campaign.  However, I have run two successful, professional test
trials on the product.  First, testing its efficacy against the traditional, rote-memorization
spelling methods found in premier spelling products used today, and second targeting
its long-term memory retention.  In both
studies, Spell-A-Cadabra proved superior.</p>
<p><b>Possible Roadblocks:</b></p>
<p>As a young
entrepreneur and inventor of a spelling tool, I have had an enormous hurdle trying
to gain a proper introduction to, as well as earn respect within a
multi-billion dollar industry.  Not
surprisingly, the educational industry can be competitive and exclusive.  This campaign lends exciting credibility and the
support necessary to jump-start the mass production of our spelling tool as it
matriculates into the lower elementary school systems and gains momentum
through our united efforts and positive results.</p>
<p>In an age that relies
heavily upon the technology of spell-check, I believe that the answer for
success rests with getting back to basics and empowering our children to think
smarter.</p>
<p><b>Other ways to Help:</b></p>
<p>Your monetary
contributions are an important part of the key to getting a Spell-A-Cadabra in the
hands of every child, but you can help even if you cannot donate money.  Your support and kind words through social
media are invaluable, and will help ensure that we have the enthusiasm and
resources necessary to get the Spell-A-Cadabra kit into American households and
schools.  Linking this page to your
friends is worth its weight in gold.  Help
us make noise and use your contacts!  It
takes a village! We also welcome private messages regarding any child, class, school,
and/or organization that could benefit from this amazing, educational tool. </p>

This is the first
Spell-A-Cadabra Campaign.  However, I have run two successful, professional test
trials on the product.  First, testing its efficacy against the traditional, rote-memorization
spelling methods found in premier spelling products used today, and second targeting
its long-term memory retention.  In both
studies, Spell-A-Cadabra proved superior.
Possible Roadblocks:
As a young
entrepreneur and inventor of a spelling tool, I have had an enormous hurdle trying
to gain a proper introduction to, as well as earn respect within a
multi-billion dollar industry.  Not
surprisingly, the educational industry can be competitive and exclusive.  This campaign lends exciting credibility and the
support necessary to jump-start the mass production of our spelling tool as it
matriculates into the lower elementary school systems and gains momentum
through our united efforts and positive results.
In an age that relies
heavily upon the technology of spell-check, I believe that the answer for
success rests with getting back to basics and empowering our children to think
smarter.
Other ways to Help:
Your monetary
contributions are an important part of the key to getting a Spell-A-Cadabra in the
hands of every child, but you can help even if you cannot donate money.  Your support and kind words through social
media are invaluable, and will help ensure that we have the enthusiasm and
resources necessary to get the Spell-A-Cadabra kit into American households and
schools.  Linking this page to your
friends is worth its weight in gold.  Help
us make noise and use your contacts!  It
takes a village! We also welcome private messages regarding any child, class, school,
and/or organization that could benefit from this amazing, educational tool.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

She is the Design Editor for the Goings on in The Gardens Newsletter at Nicky's Gardens of Hope, as well as a grant consultant for Nicky's Gardens of Hope.TESTING:A minimum of 20 products will be tested, although we want to test many more. And we will…. Depending on how much we raise.Our first focus is CBD oil, but with greater funding, we will expand (vapes, edibles, creams, etc.) Note: Different products may require different and incompatible testsIf we fail to raise the minimum funding, we will still report on… ingredients, content quantity, problematic chemicals, certifications (to operate [in which states], frequency of merchant testing, food handling, organic certification, etc.), customer complaints & reviews, and basic tests for contamination.If we raise more money we will test more products, more types of products, and more forms of testing (pesticides, chemical residue, unreported ingredients, potency, etc.). AND add a new section to talk about consumer-level testing kits.The book will contain chapters on cannabis, risk, and benefits, best research so far, traditional uses for cannabis, how to understand the label, and other consumer-oriented information.Interaction: we want to be very interactive with donors.We will periodically put out questions and surveys to determine the direction of the book.As funding rises, we want donor feedback on which new chapters, products, and tests they want in the book.We want the book to be as useful and relevant as possible for the donors.Thank you for supporting this project!https://tsctalks.comJill, Lisa, Chris & Amora",8.0,2,"1 Campaign

<h3>Sažetak</h3>
<p>Na Međunarodnoj matematičkoj olimpijadi svake godine sudjeluje oko 100 država svijeta. Svaka država šalje ekipu od najviše šest učenika koji pokušavaju riješiti što više zadataka na natjecanju.</p>
<p>Organizacija tako velikog događaja bi Hrvatsku učinila još povezanijom sa svim državama svijeta i dodatno bi ju povezala s velikim svjetskim kompanijama koje sponzoriraju ovo natjecanje.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Što nam je cilj?</h3>
<p>Za organizaciju ovog natjecanja u Hrvatskoj trebat će oko 10 milijuna kuna.</p>
<p>Ukoliko se, brojeći sve načine financiranja, sakupi dovoljno sredstava, Hrvatska će se javiti za organizaciju IMO-a u prvom slobodnom terminu. Novac će se dati na raspolaganje Hrvatskom matematičkom društvu koje će predvoditi kandidaturu Hrvatske.</p>
<p>Ako konačna suma ne bude dovoljna, novac će se iskoristiti za promicanje matematike u Hrvatskoj preko raznih projekata, kao npr. Ljetna/Zimska škola matematike itd.</p>
<p>Napominjemo kako je ovo dugoročna kampanja i novčani cilj zadan ovdje je samo dio onoga što nam treba kako bismo uspjeli.

</p><p>      Sailing is a great way to travel, see various parts of the planet, meet people either as crew members or in ports moored and at beaches when anchored. There is very little cost beyond daily maintenance such as F&amp;B and virtually no impact on the environment since the motor is usually only used to go in and out of port or to get back on course in case the wind is blowing you in a different direction. Sailing boats are definitely eco-friendly especially if compared to motorboats and other engine powered boats/ships/cruisers. Compared to flying, driving or taking a seat or berth on a cruise ship, a sailing boat's carbon footprint is very insignificant. Solar panels integrated on the surface of the boat by the manufacturer or later fitted on by the owner(s) is the main source of electrical energy during a journey, instead of gallons of gasoline! Bigger sailing boats even have wind turbines.</p>
<p>      Some of you may be wondering, but he doesn't have a sailing boat! Well, that is another feature of being a sailor, there is demand for your skippers (certified sailors that are first in charge of the boat) even without your own boat. For example, people sometimes buy a boat but can't sail it themselves, other experienced sailors would like assistance on longer trips and are also eager to teach others to bring the overall level up. Some owners and skippers actually just want to meet peers and enjoy good company on board a sailing boat at sea. Being a competent sailor is a gateway to a very intricate community of sea-farers and enthusiasts, millionaires and people who depend more on their skill and spirit than their finances. Not to mention the history of mankind and sea which spans back thousands of years before the first engine or pair of functional wings. I simply want to be part of this rich heritage, culture, and world.

Aboard a sailing boat, my self and 3 others sailed along the southern coast of Spain (Andalucia) and then across the Mediterranean at the Port of Motril near Malaga to the enclave of Melilla, an autonomous Spanish city on the African Coast of the Mediterranean Sea. about me in the press:http://redearedgnome.blogspot.com/p/in-press.htmlThis was as part of a cultural project, as a visual-artist/blogger, in participation with others from different mediterranean and European countries (Spain, Italy, Tunis, Algeria, Poland to name a few).This link will take you to the website of the organisation of this event that gave me my first sailing experience:    http://www.clandestineintegration.org   and an article written about it:http://www.piuculture.it/2015/01/integrazione-clandestina-mediterraneo/      Of the many wonderful experiences I had during those two weeks I learned many things about sailing, and had hands-on experience at the helm, night watches where we had to keep clear of big cargo ships and other traffic, and of course time with the dolphins!      Now I am enamoured with sailing and seek to sail again, and again. To improve my chances of sailing again and to do so with more confidence, less dependance, and more involvement it is necessary to get certified. This is kind of like applying for a driving licence after you've learned the basics of car operation.How you can help/where your contributions will be spent:-      Through your contributions which will be directly paid as fees to cover travel costs and course/certification fees I may become a certified skipper.

<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>We are calling this a fund raiser for seed money. It's going to cost a lot more than the $350,000 we are seeking to open the doors. But the bank won't take us seriously unless we can come to the table with the $350,000. It's also an all or nothing campaign, meaning we won't collect unless we can meet our goal. Fund raising rules by Indiegogo have us restricted to a 60 day window.</p>
<p><strong>Why so many perks?</strong> Because you worked hard for your money and the boss doesn't think you'll want to separate with it unless you're going to get something out of it. If you want to chip in money without claiming a perk to help us out, that would be great, but we know there is no such thing as a free lunch so we worked hard to get as many perks together as we could offer and still be within the rules and policies of Indiegogo. </p>
<h3>More about the Perks</h3>
<p>As we started looking for vendors, we started asking them if we could use some of their products for the perks. Almost all of them we approached said yes. So if we hit our fund raising goals, we will do a mass purchase of these products and have them shipped to the boss's house. His wife is going to love having all that stuff in her living room. Then we will get them shipped out to you. </p>
<p><u>The memberships are the meat and potatoes of our fund raising goals.</u></p>
<p>We have three different tiers of memberships. Brass, Platinum, and Founding.</p>
<p>Any membership will come with a 30 day, <strong>100%</strong> satisfaction guarantee. If you pre-purchase your membership during this Indiegogo campaign, you will have 30 days from the day we open the doors to decide if you like the club or not. For what ever reason, even if it's you don't like the colors we decided, you can get your membership initiation fee refunded. </p>

<p><strong>Help Support Child-led, Hands-on, Experiential Learning!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Contributions will help The Lab for Hands-On Learning fund development of a new community outreach effort; construction of a new outdoor play-garden and work space; and cover operational expenses for Homeschool and Afterschool Enrichment Programs in the Arts and Sciences for children 3-12 years old in NE Los Angeles.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478581282/i6rn5kyl5c0odj6xpvm9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<h3>The Lab Mission and Goals</h3>
<p>The Lab for Hands-On Learning is a uniquely different kind of enrichment center that is implementing current ideas about applied academics in an innovative way.  </p>
<p>The LAB believes that every child is a free and independent learner capable of determining the course of their own learning experiences. We know that children learn best when they participate in play with a diverse group of peers, and are free to inquire after topics and pursue goals that are immediately meaningful to their own lives and experiences.</p>
<p>We know that educational opportunities are best facilitated by caring adults skilled at providing thoughtful support for children’s social-emotional development, including fostering healthy peer relations, and helping children negotiate conflicts peacefully. Teachers at The Lab extend play and learning in a non-directive manner that encourages participation and collaboration over rote memory or repetitive exercises.</p>
<p>The Lab provides mixed-age, play-based, project-based, and interest-based learning in the arts and sciences for children 3-12 years old, conducted in a safe, stimulating environment staffed by adults trained to support children’s learning and emotional regulation. The Lab delivers a curriculum that promotes independent thinking, critical assessment, and creative problem solving.</p>
<p>The Lab’s curriculum and method emphasize process over product, and we strive to help children learn tools, methods, and understandings needed to become self-directed, empathetic, achieving adults. We hope, ultimately, that The Lab can be a place where children learn about themselves as they learn about the world around them.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478581366/ii168fyncjgig3oluo7v.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<h3>Our History and Programs</h3>
<p>The Lab for Hands-on Learning was founded in the belief that children truly thrive when they are given the chance to lead their own learning. Lab founders  have seen this belief in action in the field of early childhood education, where we have worked as teachers in various progressive models such as Regio Emellia, and Waldorf; in our roles as youth organizers working on grassroots popular education, and social entrepreneurship campaigns with at risk teens; and, of course in our own parenting.</p>
<p>The initial spark for The Lab, however, came from Gloria Williamson when, after trying unsuccessfully to find an environment that fostered the same kind of creativity and connectedness between peers that her children had grown in throughout preschool, she found herself thinking more and more about establishing that space herself.</p>
<p>After consulting with Efrim Chiavetta and others, the idea for The Lab went through several drafts and conceptual iterations. We discussed everything from being a modest arts based afterschool program for neighborhood children, to building a large scale project that incorporated a continuing education component for adults, and a fully accredited high school program.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Efrim and Gloria decided to give The Lab a test run as a Summer Camp. We leased a temporary space on the very scenic craftsman campus of Neighborhood Universalist Unitarian Church in Pasadena, launched a website, outlined what we call our Muses, or sources of inspiration for each week of programming, and began to accept registrations.</p>
<p>Once the Summer was under way, we very quickly realized we were on to something. We were told, often with enthusiasm and relief, that the approach we were taking - letting children take the lead on their projects, to learn through trial and error, and to take materials and ideas in directions entirely their own - was something that many families had been looking for for a long time. And this was particularly true of homeschooling families.</p>
<p>Over the next three months, as we watched the Summer Camp succeed beyond anything we had anticipated, we came to know many of these families, what kinds of factors contributed to their decision to homeschool, and what they were looking for in a supplemental program. And at each step along the way, we were encouraged to continue what we had started into the fall, and for the rest of the school year.</p>
<p>And that is just what we did. We leased another, smaller, room on the same campus, and launched The Lab Homeschool Support program, which not only continued the same child-led approach to arts and sciences we had started in the Summer, but also began a Parent Education component, because we know the vital importance of parental self care as well.</p>
<p>Having outgrown our temporary classroom in a matter of months, we found a new home in Eagle Rock, a community with a reputation for family friendly businesses and “hometown” atmosphere. And we could not be happier about our choice.</p>
<p>Currently we are offering Homeschool Enrichment and After School Programs five days a week, and on occasional Saturdays. We host a weekly Parent Discussion to give parents a chance to talk over issues, questions and challenges pertinent to their own parenting life. We hold a monthly speaker series that gives parents a chance to talk with experts in fields related to child development, education, and psychology. And once a month we open The Lab in the evenings to give children a chance to socialize together while parents enjoy a night out on the town at one of our local small business.</p>
<p>We are immensely excited about, and very proud of what we have achieved in such a short time, and particularly of the work we get to do every day, but we need help getting to the next level.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Curriculum</h3>
<p>Curriculum at The LAB is designed to both engage and follow a child’s natural curiosity and willingness to explore the world around them and engage it with their whole self. We are therefore committed to developing programs that are first and foremost Child Directed. We believe that children learn best when they are able to follow their inclinations and sense of wonder where it leads.</p>
<p>Each day at The Lab, children have the opportunity to engage with a variety of materials, projects and activities, such as:</p>
<p>2D and 3D art<br/>Recorded music and musical instruments<br/>Sensory and messy materials<br/>Fine motor objects<br/>Dance, yoga or movement<br/>Quiet reflection<br/>Reading and research<br/>Outdoor gross motor movement<br/>Living creatures<br/>Building materials<br/>Hand tools<br/>Electronics or robotics<br/>Natural loose parts<br/>Found objects<br/>Fabrics, string and rope<br/>Cooking utensils and recipes<br/>Physics, chemistry and biology experiments<br/>And much, much more...</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Why We Need Your Help</h3>
<p>We truly believe in the work we doing at The Lab, and we hear from parents every week how important we are to their homeschooling or parenting regimens. And we have been embraced and encouraged by our Eagle Rock neighbors, both residents, and other small businesses alike. So, we are not alone on our belief that we are a resource worth preserving. We hope that you share that belief with us.</p>
<p>In many ways, The Lab is a passion project, a work of the heart, a way to build a community of parents and learners that can challenge the prevailing educational model of teaching to the test; that can help children develop empathy for others instead of simply following behavioural rules without context;  and can provide a space for children to feel both free and supported at the same time. We believe it is what children need today in order to build a safe and healthy tomorrow.</p>
<p>But there is also more than simply belief and passion at stake in our mission, current research is behind us also. There is ample evidence suggesting that the push-down of academics onto kinder and even preschool aged children leads to early academic burnout in students later in life. Countries like Sweden and Denmark have recognized the value of play and social interaction for young learners, and have decreased or eliminated homework while increasing play and free time in public schools. There is a nationally increasing shift away from “helicopter parenting,” with the rise in popularity of “adventure playgrounds” where children can engage in risky play without an adult over seeing the risks at every moment. And more and more value is being ascribed to outdoor play in general, and there are even whole pre-schools in Germany that are held entirely in the forest.</p>
<p>We also know, from watching both local and national trends, and from our interactions with parents each week, that families are taking education into their own hands in greater and greater numbers. In the short time that The Lab has been a resource for homeschooling families, we have talked to dozens of parents that are currently making or have already made the switch away from public education within the last year alone, some of them crediting The Lab with helping them to make their decision.</p>
<p>Because of this rising trend, The Lab is part of a growing, and in many ways, precedent setting network of parents, educators, therapists, and researchers that are redefining the methods and priorities of American education.</p>
<p>We are a new, and growing business in a quickly growing field, and this campaign with provide a bridge to our next phase of growth.</p>

<h3>Your Contribution Matters</h3>
<p>When you contribute to The Lab, you will be securing a resource that is an important part of many families lives and educational routine. You will allow us to gain exposure to a wider audience of parents, and help spread a method of teaching that treats children with the deep respect they deserve. You will be supporting a vital community resource that supports our neighborhood’s commitment to families.</p>
<p>And most importantly, you will be supporting a model of education that we hope will go continue to grow. We hope that with your help, we can make this period of growth count, as we prepare for the next steps in establishing ourselves as a vital community and family resource. Because we believe that the mission to build a foundation for creative and collaborative thinking, and negotiation based in empathy and care for the other, and a curiosity about the world that is able to explore the world peacefully is too important to lose.</p>
<p>And the rapid development and successes of The Lab to date shows a dedication to the work we are doing and the skill to follow through. Your contribution matters!</p>

<h3>Our Mission and the impact on people:</h3>
<p>Dear Champion,</p>
<p>Our mission is to spread our research outcome to as many people as we can, because we believe in it.</p>
<p>We present to you stories of the ‘magic’, the ‘power to change the destiny’, in the hands of anyone, however small or big, who is willing to work hard, who can dare to dream big and has the courage to pursue it despite the worst challenges. These are also the stories of the ‘magic’, which comes with the commitment to ‘utilize the success and wealth earned for the benefit of the underprivileged’. The true joys of the journey to success and the true joys of giving can be earned by anyone.</p>
<p><strong>Please refer 'Sample story' and 'Paintings' at the end.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In short:</strong></p>
<p>We researched several successful people of current times that are living their dreams. Although very diverse, yet they have the same basic ingredients, the fire within to excel and a big heart to give.</p>
<p>We urge you to find the fire already within you, stoke it, and race towards your mission with all your might. Enjoy the journey. You will love it. You will experience long term ‘true joys’, that, material distractions can never provide</p>
<p>Help others do the same, share your winnings, with the needy and the underprivileged. You will experience the ultimate in peace, joy and satisfaction that sometimes eludes the rich and powerful</p>
<p>Destiny will accumulate wealth in your hands, so that, like a good resource manager, you can utilize it well, not only for yourself, but also for the underprivileged</p>
<p>The book is also a collection of hand painted art masterpieces. These are our labor of love. 100% hand sketched and hand painted by talented artists. No computer work involved. A lot of thought and hard work has been invested in them. We hope these are able to connect you with the stories and help convey the message.</p>

<p><strong>More details:</strong></p>
<p>In this modern day and age, as we get busy with our life and career, sometimes we find ourselves and our kids getting influenced by material possessions. Unknowingly, we get exposed to evils such as greed, jealousy, anger, lack of awareness and inspiration about responsibilities towards our own self, our families and our society. Through this book, we are trying to prevent people from this distraction and help focus on true goals.</p>
<p>This is a compilation of real life stories of men and women who dared to dream big. Out of scores of living legends, we handpicked a diverse group with different nationalities, ethnic backgrounds and age groups. Several had a very modest background. They did not win a lottery, did not find a hidden treasure nor did they receive hereditary wealth. They were passionate about different things – few enjoyed entrepreneurship and business, while others enjoyed singing, dancing, writing, sports and few others enjoyed fighting for human rights. </p>
<p>They had one thing in common - They all had a fire burning within to chase their dreams. They had the courage to follow their passion. They went all out to execute it. The road to success was not easy. Their journey was a roller coaster of successes and challenges. The strength of passion within them helped fight all challenges. They did not succumb. The universe conspired to make them succeed. It was magical. They experienced the true joys of their journey. They shared their winnings with the underprivileged and experienced the true joys of giving as well.</p>
<p>They always had a larger than life mission, to help other people, to work for a cause or to eradicate a social evil. After achieving fame and wealth, they did not squander it away. They were aware that they are managers and the not the owners of the wealth and resources. Realizing that, beyond a certain point, money had little importance for them and there are others in this world that are in dire need of resources. These champions used their time and resources to set up foundations that are helping the underprivileged across the world.  While Bill Gates founded ‘Bill and Melinda Gates foundation’ with a significant part of his own donations, Sindhutai Sapkal dedicated her entire life to caring for the orphans. She spent time educating them and providing them basic necessities such as food, water and shelter. All these champions experienced the Joy of Giving.</p>
<p>We urge you to be the force and take others forward. Spread the message amongst your kids, your relatives, your neighbors, colleagues and elders. We don’t control our entry into this world, but we have the power to decide how we want to exit, in a manner that there are no regrets. We truly believe that there is no age for chasing your dreams and helping the needy. So wherever you are, get started. <strong><i>You have already taken the first step as you believe in this and hence are reading this. </i></strong></p>
<p>Each story of the book ends with suggested next steps on how you can make an impact as an individual.</p>
<p>Happy Reading Champion ! </p>

<h3>Sample Story: Mia Hamm</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537655582/mccknrtzcxl636iam9p5.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Mia as a child was very shy. She was the fourth of six siblings. She was born in a military family who moved to a new place every 2 -3 years. Mia found it difficult to make friends because of her shy nature.  She wore corrective shoes as a toddler after being born with a club foot. She didn’t let her handicap discourage her and went onto become one of the most successful international soccer players.</p>
<p><strong>The Journey:</strong></p>
<p> Mia was very different from other girls. She did not like playing with dolls or dressing up. Mia’s mother wanted her to be a dancer and enrolled her in ballet classes. Mia hated it and would run out of each class.  </p>
<p>Mia started playing soccer when she was very young. In that era, soccer was considered to be a boys’ game, however this did not bother her. She dared to play soccer when other girls were confined to the house. Her father encouraged her and coached her too. She often played soccer with her elder brother, Garrett, whom her parents had adopted. She loved him more than her own siblings. Sports helped Mia make friends whenever she moved to a new town. </p>
<p>Mia was passionate about soccer since childhood and dreamt to be the best soccer player in the world. At 5, she joined her first soccer team. She was a natural at soccer. At junior high school, her talent and hard work made her excel at boys’ football team. She was able to achieve this, despite being short. Her height definitely did not provide her an edge in soccer.</p>
<p>The road to achievement of her goals was not easy. Mia had to manage school work and soccer practices and games together. Hence, she would wake up early in the morning and stay up late at night to finish school work. She also trained hard for her games. At 15, she was the youngest soccer player to play for the national team. She played with U.S. women's national soccer team for 17 years. </p>
<p>With unparalleled dedication, Mia became one of the greatest female athletes of all time. She won the Women's World Cup in 1991 and 1999. She won Olympic gold medals in 1996 and 2004. She held the record for most international goals scored until June 2013. At 32, she retired with a record 158 international goals.</p>
<p>She is a role model for many girls. She proved all girls should chase their dreams no matter how unattainable or difficult they may seem. She also proved that girls are just as strong, determined and capable as boys.</p>
<p>Mia has been honored with many awards such as ‘U.S. Soccer Female Athlete of the Year’ five years in a row from 1994 to 1998. She made it to the ‘FIFA 100’list. In 2013, Mia became the first woman inducted into the ‘World Football Hall of Fame’, located in Pachuca, Mexico.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Joy of Giving:</strong></p>
<p>Mia lost her brother, Garrett, due to a rare bone marrow disease. She was heart broke. She made it her mission to help others in need of bone marrow transplants and to encourage people to become donors. She established ‘Mia Hamm Foundation’ dedicated to raising funds and awareness for bone marrow and cord blood transplants. The foundation is also focused on the development of opportunities for young women in sports. </p>
<p>Mia along with her family printed up one-page flyers with her brother's story and his need for a bone marrow transplant. She took these flyers to every event she attended in order to educate people. She believed that educating people is very important as they will be able to help only when they are aware. Mia is optimistic that one day bone marrow donations will gain similar popularity as blood donations. The foundation sponsors all-star exhibition soccer matches, and during half time, marrow recipients are given the opportunity to meet their donors whom they had not seen before. Mia cherishes the emotional outburst she witnesses during this time.</p>
<p>After having set an example for girls to chase their dreams in sports without thinking about gender and other challenges, she hopes that young women will continue to participate in sports actively. She also hopes that the families will provide the required support to their girls needed for them to excel in sports. </p>
<p>Mia’s message for the world is that “Failure happens all the time. It happens every day in practice. What makes you better is how you react to it”. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Let’s help Mia in her mission to “Educate people on bone marrow transplants”</p>

Roadmap  
Team

We are a group of engineers who are passionate about what they do. We believe in the power of iteration. So, we wake up every day and do our best to improve ourselves and deliver the best products we can.
Risks & Challenges

There are always challenges in mass production. We have to make sure our products will be secure and reliable and they can be manufactured efficiently at large volumes.
Thankfully, we have strong experience in PCB design and manufacturing process from our ex-work. We still keep in touch with people whom we supplied electronic components and bare PCBs. We also established very good relations with manufacturers in Shenzhen/China. Moreover, watchX does not require the same tooling cost and manufacturing risks as products with injection molded plastic require.
And as you know, we have successfully finished our first campaign. We got backed by people from 45 different countries. Thanks to their support, there are more than 2000 people using the watchX all over right now. And we have a groving community day by day.
Of course, there are risks involved with the manufacturing. Unexpected changes in component lead times or availability are examples of factors that can affect the delivery timeline. We are doing our best to minimize these risks and deliver the products right on time.
The other risk with our product or any other product is shipping. There are a number of unforeseen incidents that can cause problems during shipping of the products. We plan to work with proven companies that will carry the products safe and sound to your doorstep.",26.0,3,"2 Campaigns

Hence, to transform this into a reality, we require financial support.</p><p>We have been in talks with the institute for some assistance, as Alumni departments from other IITs fully support their students to go to such conventions and conferences. But unfortunately, there is no centralised system in Guwahati, yet.</p><p>Not the ones to sit back, we have decided to raise the funds ourselves and bring about the change that we want to see. We are positive that we can make it, thanks to fellow entrepreneurs, caring IIT-Guwahati family we all are a part of. Today it's us, tomorrow it will be more from our country.

Innovators come from around the world to learn from MIT faculty and MIT-trained mentors. Bootcampers learn the same innovation framework and curriculum taught in core entrepreneurship classes at MIT, and practice critical skills required to be leaders and drive innovation and collaboration: teamwork, leadership, communication, mutual goal reinforcement, and giving feedback. The Bootcamps are a key component in MIT’s Global Strategy and focuses on shaping the future of education and learning.

 MIT Bootcamp Alumni ProgressMIT​ ​Global​ ​EntrepreneursThere are 381 Bootcamp participants (Bootcampers) from 70+ countries. Collectively they have launched over a 100 new ventures raising over $36 million. Five Bootcampers were selected for Forbes​ ​30​ ​under​ ​30​:Leonika Sari, Class 1 (Healthcare & Science)David Anderton, Class 1 (Media)Nasir Yammama (Class 2)Karan Jerath, Class 4 (Energy)Keiana Cavé, Class 4 (Energy)Recently, Simplify a startup founded by Yen Pei Tay (Class 2) was named to Fast Company’s Top 50 Most Innovative Companies list for 2017.Acceptance letters: IMPACT OF ATTENDING THE MIT BOOTCAMPAfter three rounds of interviews, we are privileged to have been accepted into the MIT Entrepreneurship and Innovation Bootcamp, and we believe that this experience will help bolster our skills and confidence as we go forward building our solution in India. We are the ones after just 33 Indians who have got selected for this prestigious bootcamp in the previous years. This is the first time ever that anyone from IIT Guwahati will be attending the bootcamp, and we hope to raise IIT-G's flag high!The camp is an intense 20 hours/day week long program, over the course of which a team of around five people have to identify a problem or an opportunity, create a solution, understand if it works financially and then pitch it.
To be able to attend the camp would mean the opportunity to attempt such a formidable challenge and in the process, push ourselves beyond our limits. Just surviving this, would bring about a tremendous change. Working with other participants from all across the world, each with their own diverse perspectives, will expose us to a global viewpoint. 
Exposure to global problems to understand global markets. 
We would also be mentored by the world class faculty of MIT including, _ and _ , which helps validate our thought process and the decisions we make. 
We would build and be connected to a vast network of current and future entrepreneurs. 
Moreover, after returning from this week-long convention, we aim to share our learnings and experiences with the rest of the students community in various colleges, and instill motivation among students like us to continue this culture of business innovation and entrepreneurship. 
HOW YOU CAN HELP USHailing from middle-class families in India, it’s extremely difficult to finance ourselves. Hence, to transform this into a reality, we require financial support.We have been in talks with the institute for some assistance, as Alumni departments from other IITs fully support their students to go to such conventions and conferences. But unfortunately, there is no centralised system in Guwahati, yet.Not the ones to sit back, we have decided to raise the funds ourselves and bring about the change that we want to see. We are positive that we can make it, thanks to fellow entrepreneurs, caring IIT-Guwahati family we all are a part of. Today it's us, tomorrow it will be more from our country. All this process needs to kick-start is a small push, initiative and kind-hearted individuals like you! What we needTuition fees: $6000 x 2 = $12000Airfare ~ $2250 x 2 = $4500Living expenses ~ $450 x 2 = $900Our contribution : $ 2500Total cost : $17500 - $2500Need to be raised : $ 15000 We understand that this is a huge goal to meet, but we would be grateful for any amount that you could chip in.

Of course, a parent or teacher may disable this feature if they deem it appropriate. The video shows all the basic functionality.



 

Now about lectures - one of the most important moments of studying. Here, Jein sets up for you a set of themes that you can explore by clicking on the button.

 

It will contain texts with theoretical knowledge, videos from professors and illustrations for a better understanding.

After learning theory, different tasks will be offered on the subject studied. There are different levels of difficulty, which is tailored to each user individually. When choosing a task, we automatically go to the editor, where the question is already drawn up and remains to be solved. If there are problems in the process, then the function of the tooltip might help. However, it does not solve all the tasks.


Competition is an excellent entertainment portal where you can test your knowledge and wit. The program automatically selects opponents matched to your level of knowledge.These competitions will be in the form of tests with time limits (5-15 seconds). Simple tasks are given on an idea, one formula, knowledge of a theory, or simply interesting questions.

 
Our platform for training can be launched on any smartphone, tablet, or even online in your browser.


This is where you come in
Your funds will be used to maintain servers so that everyone can quickly receive and store the required information. We also want to work with professional instructors who can create quality lectures for children. As for the program itself, a part of raised funds will be spent on acceleration of the creation of the functioning parts of the toolkit. After closing these issues, we have to register the product officially with all the documents and lawyers to enter the market. Well, at the very end, the remainders will go to advertising for a faster growth in the number of users within system expansion.
Well, in the end, you will find us on Google Play and the App Store in a few months.",15.0,2,"1 Campaign

The Impact

 
It’s well known among educators that complex and abstract topics can be understood more easily (especially by younger students) when concepts are introduced visually. Visuals not only improve a student’s ability to understand how something works but also helps with retention. Furthermore, by seeing the “whole” of something, children are better able to understand the parts.
Even more importantly, research shows that 3D-animated models can represent information most efficiently to speed learning and comprehension. 85% of students prefer visual and kinesthetic learning, while only 15% prefer hearing about a topic as a way of education.

<p>The Sania Box embedded computer kit contains a one-of-its kind add-on board that aids in developing STEM skills in children. The kit is conceived by 13-year-old Sania Jain who wishes to introduce coding to kids from an early age. The add-on board and other components of the Sania Box kit bring all coding projects to life with their unique features.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1583274231/b4cvolpp5tc1e41vmuun.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE SANIA BOX ADD-ON BOARD </strong></p>
<p>Central to the Sania Box kit is an embedded computer, an add-on board that fits on the Raspberry Pi 3 or Pi 4 board 40 Pin header. This add-on board is pre-designed to give children with a hands-on experience about coding. It features push buttons, LED lights, and multiple sensors such as the thermal sensor, and the gas sensor. It is also integrated with a 3-digit, 7-segment clock display. Can you imagine the level of fun that kids can have with this kit while learning to program? To make the Sania Box complete in itself, and to enable kids to learn coding right away, the kit supplements the add-on board with an SD Card containing pre-installed programs. The keyboard and mouse in the kit are essential items and the breadboard, wires, LEDs, and resistors create a perfect educational tool.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH IT? </strong></p>
<p>One of the features that makes Sania Box unique is the add-on board that is a pre-designed and pre-tested add-on circuit board. It is different from a breadboard and a cable kit that are difficult to assemble without adult help and supervision.  The add-on board is a safe and ready-to-use component unlike a breadboard and cable kit that can hurt kids while assembly. Sania Box plans to create more add-on boards in near-future by working closely with kids and parents.</p>

<p><strong>PYTHON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE</strong></p>
<p>The Raspberry Pi is a compact computer that is preferred by every DIY tech-lover and depends on Python as its preferred programming language. Once you are acquainted with Python, there are very less chances that you will resort to other programming languages for your tasks.</p>

<p><strong>MORE ABOUT THE SANIA BOX</strong></p>
<p>The Sania Box is an embedded computer kit with a special add-on board made for children who are 8 years and above. This build-it-yourself project is made to encourage children to learn about computer engineering including coding, IoT, electronics, and more.</p>
<p>Sania wishes to open up the possibilities of learning computer engineering for every child.  Her mission is to take this fun project to kids nationwide and then worldwide including schools, after-care/enrichment centers, and camps to generate self-driven interest in coding and introductory hands-on electronics and IoT which is otherwise accessible to a select few. Please make a pledge to buy the Sania Box Embedded Computer Kit for the young computer enthusiast you know, or help us raise funds and achieve our goal to expand throughout the country and beyond for young learners.</p>
<p>What’s more, it is made by professionals with the help of Sania who lives and breathes coding in her life. Sania wanted to reach out to other kids, who wish to learn coding in a simple and engaging way with her add-on board and other components in the kit, and the Sania Box offers the perfect opportunity to do so.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1583274738/wfx5i4hgwzm1jaae0jd2.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>WHAT’S IN THE BOX?</strong></p>
<p>The Sania Box add-on board is a hands-on learning tool for all those kids who want to learn programming and create projects based on their codes. Therefore, we have created a kit that kids can start using right away.  Though the Sania Box is complete in itself, it will present the users with a problem where they will have to source multiple components from different places, which would not have been a pleasant experience. For example, the supplied SD Card contains the pre-loaded programs. The keyboard and mouse are essential items and the breadboard, wires, LEDs, and resistors create a perfect learning device.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1583274791/os47raeaz78hna39cclg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is a comprehensive list of items in the kit:</p>
<p>1. Wired keyboard and mouse</p>
<p>2. Custom Case</p>
<p>3. USB-C Power supply</p>
<p>4. 16 GB SD card with pre-loaded software to help you start programming out of the box</p>
<p>5. HDMI cable to use a TV as your monitor</p>
<p>6. A Raspberry Pi Model 4 with 1 GB Ram and 64-bit quad-core processor to power the add-on board</p>
<p>7. The Sania Box embedded add-on board has the following features:</p>
<p>· 2 LEDs (Red and Green) that can blink, keep steady, and turn off</p>
<p>· Push Button</p>
<p>· Thermal Sensor</p>
<p>· Touch Sensor</p>
<p>· Three-digit, 7-segment Display</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHY ARE KIDS EXCITED ABOUT IT?</strong></p>
<p>No computer in the world is as easy to put together as Sania Box. The excitement of building your own computer is only the beginning of working on this computer kit.</p>
<p>The Sania Box makes children independent while learning, as everything they need to work is right here in this kit. Just connect it to a TV monitor with an HDMI cable and they are good to go. The kit is supplemented with a keyboard and a mouse so they don’t ask for yours every time they want to work on their computer. However, their freedom of learning on the Sania Box is assisted on every step of the way. The pre-loaded coding programs help them to learn the basics of computer engineering. As they learn, experiment, and evolve, they can access new programs on Sania’s website. The LED lights, thermal sensors, push buttons, gas sensors and other accessories bring their coding experiments to life. </p>
<p><strong>OUR FUTURE DREAM</strong></p>
<p>We dream of a future where we can motivate every child to take up programming and learn it in a simple and easy way. Apart from the in-built programs that kids can learn at various levels, we also publish new programs on our website <a href=""http://www.saniabox.com%C2%A0regularly"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.saniabox.com</a> regularly so that young computer science lovers may never run out of projects. We want children to enjoy programming and take it up in the future as a profession. We are aware that technology is set to rule our tomorrow and we want today’s kids to be an important part of that future.</p>
<p>Sania Box aims to provide more add-on boards with various levels of complexity. Therefore, kids at various levels of learning can find useful and new projects to learn. These add-on boards can be purchased separately, or parents can subscribe to us to receive a new add-on board every month.</p>
<p>We want experimentation to be an important aspect of learning and therefore encourage all users of Sania Box to create their own coding projects. This way kids will be able to create their own IoT devices and programs for learning and entertainment.</p>

<p><i><strong>Sania Jain, Alok Jain, Vikas Shukla, Vishwas Jain</strong></i></p>
<p>The team involved in bringing this project to life is special in many ways. This project was conceived by our youngest team member Sania who wishes all kids to have a real-life, practical knowledge of programming and what it can do. Her dream became our mission and we as professionals stepped in to create the Sania Box, a DIY computer kit with one of the best add-on boards available that can offer hands-on learning of programming to its users. Our team of technology experts, designers, and programmers from the Silicon Valley at <a href=""http://www.moonshotjr.com%C2%A0have"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.moonshotjr.com </a> have endeavored to build this computer kit to assist, educate, and empower kids to be the tech leaders of tomorrow.</p>
<p> </p>
</div></div>","The Sania Box embedded computer kit contains a one-of-its kind add-on board that aids in developing STEM skills in children. The kit is conceived by 13-year-old Sania Jain who wishes to introduce coding to kids from an early age. The add-on board and other components of the Sania Box kit bring all coding projects to life with their unique features.

 
THE SANIA BOX ADD-ON BOARD 
Central to the Sania Box kit is an embedded computer, an add-on board that fits on the Raspberry Pi 3 or Pi 4 board 40 Pin header. This add-on board is pre-designed to give children with a hands-on experience about coding. It features push buttons, LED lights, and multiple sensors such as the thermal sensor, and the gas sensor. It is also integrated with a 3-digit, 7-segment clock display. Can you imagine the level of fun that kids can have with this kit while learning to program? To make the Sania Box complete in itself, and to enable kids to learn coding right away, the kit supplements the add-on board with an SD Card containing pre-installed programs. The keyboard and mouse in the kit are essential items and the breadboard, wires, LEDs, and resistors create a perfect educational tool.
 


 
WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH IT? 
One of the features that makes Sania Box unique is the add-on board that is a pre-designed and pre-tested add-on circuit board. It is different from a breadboard and a cable kit that are difficult to assemble without adult help and supervision.  The add-on board is a safe and ready-to-use component unlike a breadboard and cable kit that can hurt kids while assembly. Sania Box plans to create more add-on boards in near-future by working closely with kids and parents.
 

 
PYTHON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
The Raspberry Pi is a compact computer that is preferred by every DIY tech-lover and depends on Python as its preferred programming language. Once you are acquainted with Python, there are very less chances that you will resort to other programming languages for your tasks.

MORE ABOUT THE SANIA BOX
The Sania Box is an embedded computer kit with a special add-on board made for children who are 8 years and above. This build-it-yourself project is made to encourage children to learn about computer engineering including coding, IoT, electronics, and more.
Sania wishes to open up the possibilities of learning computer engineering for every child.  Her mission is to take this fun project to kids nationwide and then worldwide including schools, after-care/enrichment centers, and camps to generate self-driven interest in coding and introductory hands-on electronics and IoT which is otherwise accessible to a select few. Please make a pledge to buy the Sania Box Embedded Computer Kit for the young computer enthusiast you know, or help us raise funds and achieve our goal to expand throughout the country and beyond for young learners.
What’s more, it is made by professionals with the help of Sania who lives and breathes coding in her life. Sania wanted to reach out to other kids, who wish to learn coding in a simple and engaging way with her add-on board and other components in the kit, and the Sania Box offers the perfect opportunity to do so.

WHAT’S IN THE BOX?
The Sania Box add-on board is a hands-on learning tool for all those kids who want to learn programming and create projects based on their codes. Therefore, we have created a kit that kids can start using right away.  Though the Sania Box is complete in itself, it will present the users with a problem where they will have to source multiple components from different places, which would not have been a pleasant experience. For example, the supplied SD Card contains the pre-loaded programs. The keyboard and mouse are essential items and the breadboard, wires, LEDs, and resistors create a perfect learning device.

 
Here is a comprehensive list of items in the kit:
1. Wired keyboard and mouse
2. Custom Case
3. USB-C Power supply
4. 16 GB SD card with pre-loaded software to help you start programming out of the box
5. HDMI cable to use a TV as your monitor
6. A Raspberry Pi Model 4 with 1 GB Ram and 64-bit quad-core processor to power the add-on board
7. The Sania Box embedded add-on board has the following features:
· 2 LEDs (Red and Green) that can blink, keep steady, and turn off
· Push Button
· Thermal Sensor
· Touch Sensor
· Three-digit, 7-segment Display
· Relay Circuit
· Light Sensor
· Gas Sensor (CO2, methane, etc)

 
WHY ARE KIDS EXCITED ABOUT IT?
No computer in the world is as easy to put together as Sania Box. The excitement of building your own computer is only the beginning of working on this computer kit.
The Sania Box makes children independent while learning, as everything they need to work is right here in this kit. Just connect it to a TV monitor with an HDMI cable and they are good to go. The kit is supplemented with a keyboard and a mouse so they don’t ask for yours every time they want to work on their computer. However, their freedom of learning on the Sania Box is assisted on every step of the way. The pre-loaded coding programs help them to learn the basics of computer engineering. As they learn, experiment, and evolve, they can access new programs on Sania’s website. The LED lights, thermal sensors, push buttons, gas sensors and other accessories bring their coding experiments to life. 
OUR FUTURE DREAM
We dream of a future where we can motivate every child to take up programming and learn it in a simple and easy way. Apart from the in-built programs that kids can learn at various levels, we also publish new programs on our website www.saniabox.com regularly so that young computer science lovers may never run out of projects.

<p><b><u>Clearing the Confusion in Phonics for SEN Pupils</u></b></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p>A testimonial for resources designed by Ms. Irina Litovcenko.</p>
<p>I am writing to commend to you a series of prompts especially designed to progress SEN students in phonics at Key Stage 3.</p>
<p>Recent trends in schools towards “synthetic phonics” with it’s inherent rigidity, together with other new and even traditional phonics teaching, while of clear benefit to more able pupils, has been observed to cause significant anxiety and stress in the case of many SEN pupils to the extent where their whole learning experience is affected. </p>
<p>The development of new teaching methods is of course an intrinsic component in the development of Education as a whole. However, where schools and SEN schools in particular are unable to decouple old or integrate new systems effectively, the resulting hybridisation often results in confusion for those pupils not quite on the cusp of phonics comprehension.</p>
<p>As a practitioner of long standing, teaching throughout the SEN realm, I have in recent years along with other professionals in this field, become increasingly frustrated at the lack of resources available to bridge the potential gaps outlined above.  </p>
<p>During this past year I have had the good fortune to be a participant in using of a set of prompts designed specifically to overcome many of the pupil-perceived hurdles in the teaching of SEN phonics.</p>
<p>Ms. Litovcenko has produced a set of ingenious but simple slides which cover both the most common phonemes and those that are the most difficult for pupils with learning disabilities to understand. Whilst the process is easy for practitioners like myself to deal with in concept and operation, more importantly, pupils presenting difficulties in learning phonics are able to grasp the purpose of the slides and within a short time progression is readily evidenced.</p>
<p>Since using these resources in everyday practice I have been able to report improvement in the majority of pupils to one whole NC level in one term with 2 sub-levels achieved by the rest.</p>
<p>I am commending Ms Litovcenko’s simple but superb system to you because it works and in my view it is worthy of publishing.</p>
<p>You will I am sure appreciate that professional presentation of these slides would be prohibitively expensive without the graphics expertise of a publishing house such as yours. However, I am convinced having used them and seen the results at first hand that these resources in the right package would do much to clear the confusion, anxiety and inevitable disaffection from the phonics learning experience of SEN pupils nationally.</p>

Recent trends in schools towards “synthetic phonics” with it’s inherent rigidity, together with other new and even traditional phonics teaching, while of clear benefit to more able pupils, has been observed to cause significant anxiety and stress in the case of many SEN pupils to the extent where their whole learning experience is affected. 
The development of new teaching methods is of course an intrinsic component in the development of Education as a whole. However, where schools and SEN schools in particular are unable to decouple old or integrate new systems effectively, the resulting hybridisation often results in confusion for those pupils not quite on the cusp of phonics comprehension.
As a practitioner of long standing, teaching throughout the SEN realm, I have in recent years along with other professionals in this field, become increasingly frustrated at the lack of resources available to bridge the potential gaps outlined above.  
During this past year I have had the good fortune to be a participant in using of a set of prompts designed specifically to overcome many of the pupil-perceived hurdles in the teaching of SEN phonics.
Ms. Litovcenko has produced a set of ingenious but simple slides which cover both the most common phonemes and those that are the most difficult for pupils with learning disabilities to understand. Whilst the process is easy for practitioners like myself to deal with in concept and operation, more importantly, pupils presenting difficulties in learning phonics are able to grasp the purpose of the slides and within a short time progression is readily evidenced.
Since using these resources in everyday practice I have been able to report improvement in the majority of pupils to one whole NC level in one term with 2 sub-levels achieved by the rest.
I am commending Ms Litovcenko’s simple but superb system to you because it works and in my view it is worthy of publishing.
You will I am sure appreciate that professional presentation of these slides would be prohibitively expensive without the graphics expertise of a publishing house such as yours. However, I am convinced having used them and seen the results at first hand that these resources in the right package would do much to clear the confusion, anxiety and inevitable disaffection from the phonics learning experience of SEN pupils nationally.
