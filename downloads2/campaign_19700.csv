</p><h1><b>The Team and The Goal:</b></h1>
<p>We have put together a <b>FANTASTIC</b> production team of younger designers/minds.  The main reason for going with younger Chicago artists is to make this an experience from which we can all gain exposure and an unified appreciation for collaboration.  While I have either worked with each member of this team, prior to now, or we have become friends through the community - we all have the same desire to do a show ""on our own"" and ""just for the art.""  </p>
<p>We are looking to reach out to the theatre community and present a work that is independent of a season and separated from an already established company.  </p>
<p>Design Team: Jeff-Award-Winning Designer <b>Amanda Rozmiarek</b> (Set Design), Soon-to-be DePaul Graduate <b>Megan Turner</b> (Costume Design), Interrobang Theatre Project's <b>Claire Chrzan</b> (Lighting Design), Professional-Prior-to-Graduation <b>David Samba </b>(Sound Design), and Moscow Art Theatre Alum <b>Vivian Knouse</b> (Props Design)</p>

<h2><b>The Director: Jeffrey Clark Stokes</b></h2>
<p>I have been working, actively, in the Chicago theatre scene for the 3.5 years since I relocated (Performed in 3 productions, costumed one, and stage managed six).  Prior to Chicago, I got my B.A. in Theatre (minor in Speech Communications) from Ouachita Baptist Univeristy.  There I discovered and developed my passion for directing.  Soon after finishing school - I put up a production of two one acts with related themes; ""Plays in the Park,"" I called it.  After feeling that that was a success, I went on to direct a sideshow staged reading of 4.48 Psychosis by Sarah Kane at the summer theatre company where I worked for two summers.  </p>
<p>My feelings thus far have been that I can use whatever experience I gain to my advantage, as a director.  Here I am, having worked with 8 directors in the Chicago area - and being friends with a few more - ready to put all of my recent experience into a work of my own.  </p>
<h2><b>The Funds</b></h2>
<p>While we realize that $14,250 sounds pretty steep - we intend to use it very wisely; HOWEVER, after a recent meeting with the team - we have determined we can put this production together for as little as $4000!!! This is exciting because if we reach this goal, we will have a production.  Anything more than that will just enhance our project!!!</p>
<p>No one is expecting to walk away from this production with deep pockets.  However, with the time and artistic commitment we want all involved in this production to be rewarded for their hard work and their creative endeavors; each person involved will be getting a couple hundred dollars as a modest stipend.  (Stipends for All Involved; Actors, Designers, Marketing, PR - $5500).</p><p>They will, of course, also need a budget to work with - having discussed this with each of my team - we have constructed a strict budget to work from.  (Budgets for All Creative Departments; Set, Lights, Costumes, Sound, Props - $3100).</p><p>Rehearsal and Performance Space Rentals - $3050.</p><p>Marketing/PR - $1200.</p><p>Rights to The Production/Running Costs/Processing Fees/Etc. - $1400.</p>

history of the culture but at the same time push it forward artistically
 in unexpected ways. My new vision is to take that same respect and 
creativity to the next level by creating a show where all the 
songs, beats, dancing and visuals are written, produced,
 and choreographed in house. And to top it of, I also want to tour this show. 
So, I need your help. I have the talent and the ideas but your donation will help me pay for studio time to make songs, choreography rehearsals, music publishing, costumes, travel 
expenses and so much more. Sounds crazy but I'm optimistic that we can 
do it. And you're not just helping me, you're helping all of my friends and collaborators who sacrifice to bring quality art to their communities. 
Thank you for your time and contribution in advance. Big hugs! Anton",1.0,2,"1 Campaign

<h2><b>What We Need</b></h2>
<p>The project has been made possible through the LSO's Soundhub Scheme for emerging composers. They have granted five 3-hour sessions in the Jerwood Hall for rehearsals together with technical support for the concert.</p>
<p>Other funding has come through a generous award from the <b>Hinrichsen Foundation. </b>This has been used to pay all the musicians and artists properly for their involvement. As Director, Robert has been responsible for hiring the other artists. He is not taking any money for himself or looking to make financial gain.</p>
<p>The concert has incurred an additional <b>£2,515 </b>in technical fees from LSO St Luke's, which need to be paid by the end of August 2014. These comprise of:</p>
<p>- <b>£1,800 for additional technical support. </b>This comes in the form of three hired technicians who will operate the lighting rigs, screen projector and PA system in the hall during rehearsals. Each technician bares a cost of £200 per session in the hall. They are each required for three sessions, bringing the total cost to £1,800.</p>
<p>- <b>£495 for additional hall hire. </b>Because of the scale of the event, it has been necessary to hire the Jerwood Hall for an extra 3-hour session in addition to the sessions provided by the LSO Soundhub Scheme. The usual cost of the hall for 3 hours is close to £1,500, but we have been able to secure a discounted rate.</p>
<p>- <b>£150 for concert stewards</b>. Three LSO stewards need to be hired for the concert, with a cost of £50 each for their work over the whole day and through the event.</p>
<p>- <b>£70 for piano tuning. </b>The Steinway Grand piano in the Jerwood Hall is a remarkable instrument that requires regular maintenance. With all the moving required for rehearsals and the concert, the piano needs to be tuned on the day of the performance. £70 is the standard rate for LSO St Luke's piano tuners.</p>
<p>There is a <b>'4% of the target' fee from Indiegogo.com</b>. This comes to just over <b>£100. </b>And finally there is an approximate <b>3.5%</b> <b>PayPal fee </b>for all transactions. This is <b>£88</b>, taking the total we are looking to raise to to <b>£2700.</b></p>

A variety of perks have been created, including a CD of music from the concert and copies of Robert Szymanek's previous releases. These can either be collected on the night of the concert if you are attending, or they can be posted to you to arrive in early August.</span></p><h2><b>What Happens If the Target is Not Reached</b></h2>
<p>This fund-raising scheme is based on Indiegogo's <b>Flexible Funding</b> package. That means that whether or not we reach our target, all funds will be kept and go towards the LSO fees.</p>
<p>However, if we do not reach our target, Indiegogo.com will increase their fee to 9% of the target. This will be paid from the funds raised.</p>

</p><p>DANZA IN SCENA è un progetto sotto la direzione artistica di <b>Alessandra Costa</b>, dedicato ad allievi di tutte le età che abbiano un livello di studio intermedio - avanzato e per danzatori che abbiano un buon livello di esperienza.<br/>
Si tratta di un'occasione unica per approfondire lo studio della danza contemporanea e del teatro-danza attraverso un percorso fatto di lezioni tecniche -laboratori - prove -performance ma soprattutto spettacolo e sperimentazione di un processo creativo in tutte le varie declinazioni.</p>
<p>Il progetto è dedicato a tutti coloro che vogliono approfondire lo studio della danza praticandolo e sperimentandolo nell'esperienza di scena.<br/><br/>
La particolarità del Progetto DANZA IN SCENA sta proprio in questo: formare, perfezionare il danzatore mettendolo in gioco direttamente su quello che sarà il suo campo d'azione, ovvero la performance e il suo inevitabile dialogo con lo spettatore da una parte e con lo staff tecnico dall'altra. Dunque si studia e si va in scena e andando in scena si accelerano determinati processi di comprensione e maturazione.</p><p></p><h3>Audizioni</h3><p>Vuoi far parte anche tu di questo progetto?

DANZA IN SCENA è un progetto sotto la direzione artistica di Alessandra Costa, dedicato ad allievi di tutte le età che abbiano un livello di studio intermedio - avanzato e per danzatori che abbiano un buon livello di esperienza.
Si tratta di un'occasione unica per approfondire lo studio della danza contemporanea e del teatro-danza attraverso un percorso fatto di lezioni tecniche -laboratori - prove -performance ma soprattutto spettacolo e sperimentazione di un processo creativo in tutte le varie declinazioni.
Il progetto è dedicato a tutti coloro che vogliono approfondire lo studio della danza praticandolo e sperimentandolo nell'esperienza di scena.
La particolarità del Progetto DANZA IN SCENA sta proprio in questo: formare, perfezionare il danzatore mettendolo in gioco direttamente su quello che sarà il suo campo d'azione, ovvero la performance e il suo inevitabile dialogo con lo spettatore da una parte e con lo staff tecnico dall'altra. Dunque si studia e si va in scena e andando in scena si accelerano determinati processi di comprensione e maturazione.AudizioniVuoi far parte anche tu di questo progetto?

will premiere June 5 & 6th 8pm at Center for Performance Research and be released as a dance film directed by Anthony McGowan late 2013.

Under the direction of Ariel Asch, the show will feature amazing dancers from all walks of life with the live music of Sashka, Silas Fermoy, the Glenn Asch Quartet, and more.  It will also feature the projection design and cinematography of Anthony McGowan, and set design by Rich Hahn.The indie-ballet collaborative is a project based company where a new inclusive performance-experience is created by our commitment to fostering a synergetic relationship between dance and other art forms.  We have assembled a team of artists; dancers, musicians, photographers, film-makers, and actors to collaboratively create an evening length work based on our own human experience- fond memories, finer (and not so “fine”) moments, struggles, celebrations, and sense of humor.  The work is named as a directive for our audience to be human with us!Movement lives and breathes in every visual media form. However, what we strive to do at ibc is emphasize the craft, the composition & the process. The human experience relies on dialogues (often spoken) to coexist, but by using motion as the primary expressive tool for a nonverbal dialogue we the audience, as well as the participants engage our perspective in a way of unparalleled beauty. Its graceful, its elegant, and simply a whole lot of fun to film. Our approach to creating this work: Anne Bogart wrote; “You cannot expect other people to create meaning for you. You cannot wait for someone else to define your life. You make meaning by forging it with your hands. It requires sweat and commitment. Working toward the creation of meaning is the point. it is action that forges the meaning and the significance of a life.”This is something that guides us in our process and gives us the courage as young artists to take action towards this project.  The rehearsal process is an investigative series of workshops dealing heavily in character development and improvisational exercises- this allows each artist to be personally invested in the final product and lets it grow organically allowing room for significant synergies.We need your support!The process is underway, and choreographing and conceptualizing this show collaboratively is very exciting for all of us, and we need a little “collaboration” from you in order to produce this dance for film as well as for the premiere June 5 and 6th at Center for Performance Research. So please help us reach our financial goal, everything counts, and all your donations are tax-deductible!Your money will go towards

<h3>What the Plum it's all about...</h3>
<p>Johnny is a farmer who can talk to plums. He’s also in love with one, too. When the illicit affair becomes a public scandal, the adulterous plum and her sisters receive their grim sentence- plucked and sent to an ultra-chic supermarket, which, from their perspective, is a Berlin Night Club full of lights, music, plastics, pesticides, and not to mention, some dangerous looking fruit. A psychedelic trip offered by one dubious apple sends the plums to a circus in Calcutta (of all places), where bread and butter sing, a bag of sugar sweet talks, and a courtroom waits to cast their final verdict. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The play follows the life cycle of five plums who are also witches: from tree, to being plucked, to supermarket, to being peeled. Each segment of the cycle is brought to life through the exploration of their landscape as imagined to be experienced by the plums themselves. This tragic journey of fruit following their inevitable fate as part of the greater food chain also historically mirrors the sense of calamity that was prevalent during the early 16th century witch-hunts and trials. The tree then becomes a space of home, rootedness, and of deep spiritual connection to nature, where, on the flip side, the supermarket becomes a space of artifice and trial: where lights, music, plastic, pesticide and the introduction of other foreign produce becomes a whole other daze for the plums to contend with. </p>

Kristine Haruna Lee, Stevo Arnoczy, Sasha Arutyunova, Andrew Butler, and Lauren Swan-Potras and we are putting up a brand new play titled Plum de Force at the highly acclaimed Bushwick Starr in Brooklyn as part of the Propeller Project Series this fall 2013.
We are so grateful for any contribution you can make, big or small, because with your generous support this collaboration will be able to reach its full potentials, and the play will truly soar! 
 
Plum de Force



Bushwick Starr September 5-8 at 8pm
 
Written and Directed by: Kristine Haruna Lee
Stage Manager: Maggie Yeomans
Costumes by: Karen Boyer and Bevan Dunbar
Lights by: Sarah Lurie
Set by: Greg Laffey
Original Music Composed by: Kathryn Hathaway
Sound by: Mike De Angelis
Projection Design by: Stevo Arnoczy
Photo Design by: Sasha Arutyunova
 
Starring: Stevo Arnoczy, Andrew Butler, Matt Carr, NicHi Douglas, Jo Lampert, Anastasia Olowin, Cyndi Perzcek, Julia Sirna-Frest, Lauren Swan-Potras, Chinaza Uche and Marisa Lark Wallin.
 



What the Plum it's all about...
Johnny is a farmer who can talk to plums. He’s also in love with one, too. When the illicit affair becomes a public scandal, the adulterous plum and her sisters receive their grim sentence- plucked and sent to an ultra-chic supermarket, which, from their perspective, is a Berlin Night Club full of lights, music, plastics, pesticides, and not to mention, some dangerous looking fruit. A psychedelic trip offered by one dubious apple sends the plums to a circus in Calcutta (of all places), where bread and butter sing, a bag of sugar sweet talks, and a courtroom waits to cast their final verdict. 
 
The play follows the life cycle of five plums who are also witches: from tree, to being plucked, to supermarket, to being peeled. Each segment of the cycle is brought to life through the exploration of their landscape as imagined to be experienced by the plums themselves. This tragic journey of fruit following their inevitable fate as part of the greater food chain also historically mirrors the sense of calamity that was prevalent during the early 16th century witch-hunts and trials. The tree then becomes a space of home, rootedness, and of deep spiritual connection to nature, where, on the flip side, the supermarket becomes a space of artifice and trial: where lights, music, plastic, pesticide and the introduction of other foreign produce becomes a whole other daze for the plums to contend with. 
 
Your Contribution...



Your contribution will help us buy the materials we need to build the set and costumes. Most importantly, we'll be able to rent some extra rehearsal space and compensate our insanely talented artists and collaborators.

<p>All these questions and more will be reviewed, studied and hopefully answered in HARRY, MY CAT DIED.</p>

<h3>About <em>The Man Who Laughs</em>
</h3>
<p class=""p1"">In <em>The Man Who Laughs</em><strong>, six live actors transport the audience to a movie house in 1923</strong>, when glamorous stars told larger-than-life stories without a single spoken word. Grab a bag of freshly popped popcorn, take a seat, and watch the hilarious and heartrending story of Gwynplaine, a clown whose face has been surgically disfigured into a permanent smile. Performing with his adoptive sister and father, Gwynplaine gains fame and a very modest fortune for his comic acts-and his comical face. Secretly he yearns to be more than a freak and a joke-but when his yearning leads him into the arms of a debauched duchess fascinated by grin, the results are disastrous for Gwynplaine and for his family.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Based on Victor Hugo's novel <em>The Man Who Laughs</em>, <strong>the play is performed in the style of a silent film, complete with live piano accompaniment, projected title cards, and a vibrant black-and-white set</strong>. <em>The Man Who Laughs </em>transforms silent film into live action, taking us back to a time when performers didn't need to speak to pull on our heart strings and tickle our funny bones.</p>

<h3>Diamond Girls Stage Play and Documentary</h3>
<p>The Diamond Girls Stage Play debut will be held on Saturday, November 3 at the Paul Robeson Theater here in Detroit, MI. There will be 2 shows...a 3:00pm Matinee and an 8:00pm main show.</p>
<h3>Diamond Girls Synopsis</h3>
<p><span>Charlene Diggs is 25 years old and has just married the love of her life, Marquis Diggs and they are expecting their first child. They have a brand new home, several successful businesses, and all the money they could ever want. There’s just one problem, Marquis, also known as “Hollywood”, is the boss of a major drug organization known as “The Brotherhood”. As Charlene contemplates the future of her family, especially her unborn child, she tries to convince her husband to give up the street lifestyle and to focus on their legitimate businesses. She explains that she fears for his safety and doesn’t want to raise their son by herself. But Hollywood’s drug organization is growing larger and larger and he explains to Charlene that he hears her but can’t get out of the business right then. On the night that Charlene goes into labor Hollywood is gunned down outside their home in an apparent drug hit.</span></p>
<p> Five years later Charlene is a single mom, successful business owner, and a faithful member in her church, but she is worried about her girlfriends Portia, Keisha, and Stacey, who are dating Hollywood’s former lieutenants that are now the new bosses of The Brotherhood. She sets out to help them see that dating men in the street life is a dead end road that leads to loneliness, heartache, and even jail or death. The girls all hear what she’s saying but don’t really listen. </p>
<p> But little do they know that a perfect storm is brewing for The Brotherhood. An ongoing federal investigation, a budding street war with a rival dealer, and a very unlikely member of their organization who has become an informant for the feds, will all have severe consequences for not only the Brotherhood leadership, but also anyone connected to them, including the women who love them. </p>
<p> It’s a race against time as Charlene tries to convince her girlfriends to change their ways and abandon ship before the storm that’s brewing hits. Will she succeed? Find out as you witness this story of love, deception, danger, tragedy, and triumph. </p>
<h3>Who I Am</h3>
<p>I am a Detroit based music producer, writer, and CEO of Soul Food Entertainment, LLC, an entertainment firm that specializes in all areas of media production and development. During my 20+ years in the entertainment business, I have worked with countless independent and major Gospel, Jazz, and R&amp;B artists, either playing keyboards, producing, writing, or arranging for them. Some of my current and past clients include Dorinda Clark Cole, The 3x Grammy Award winning Clark Sisters, Fred Hammond, Warner Brothers Records, Sony/BMG Records, NBC, and EMI Records to name a few. In addition to music, my company is also developing several projects in the areas of TV, Film, Radio, as well as Fashion. Also, I have served as music director and/or production manager on several local and national stage plays, and am now stepping out with my own endeavor, which is the Diamond Girls project. I strongly believe that my years of creative and technical experience, along with a strong and experienced support team will be a major factor in the success of this project.</p>
<h3>Why I'm Doing This Project</h3>
<p>My desire for this project is not just to entertain, but to tell a story that hasn't been adequately told, and to deliver a message that I believe will help not only women, but also men think about the choices they make and how it affects those around them. The media paints such a glamorous and romantic picture of the street lifestyle when there's so much death and destruction attached to it. My desire is to remove the mask and show the lifestyle for what it really is...a life full of pain, disappointment, death, and lost and stolen dreams...and to show that it's never too late to change and turn things around for the better.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>I NEED YOUR HELP!!!</h3>
<p>In order to make this project happen I need you, yes YOU!!! The money you donate will go towards the production of the stage play, the documentary, and the soundtrack. We have already began production of the documentary and the soundtrack but need additional funds to complete them. Some of the expenses include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Theater Rental</li>
<li>Lighting and Sound Rental</li>
<li>Cast and Crew (some actors and crew members will be volunteers and others will be paid professionals to ensure the quality of the production)</li>
<li>Marketing and Promotions (Fliers, Posters, TV and Radio Advertising, Street Team, Website Development)</li>
<li>Rehearsal Venue Rental</li>
<li>Set Design and Construction</li>
<li>Musicians</li>
<li>Video Crew (For the taping of the show)</li>
<li>Finishing Production of the Documentary (Filming, Editing, and Manufacturing)</li>
<li>Finishing Production of the CD Soundtrack (Recording, Mixing, Mastering, and Manufacturing)</li>
</ul>
<p>For helping us with this endeavor there are several perks and benefits that I am offering, including play tickets, copies of the documentary and soundtrack, special seating at the play, as well as several perks not open to the public, such as behind the scenes footage of the production and entrance to some of the invite only events such as the Soundtrack Listening Party. A detailed list of the perks can be found on the right side of this page.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I believe that this project will touch many lives and cause many to soul search and rethink their decisions, as well as make them laugh and be entertained. Eventually, this play will tour around the country as well as be turned into an actual full length feature film. I even plan to start a Diamond Girls non-profit organization that will help young women. But we must start somewhere and with your help we can start something that will be more than just a play, or a movie, or a soundtrack...we can start a Diamond Girls MOVEMENT!!!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>As you can see there are many differnt donation levels from great to small and every little bit helps and even if we don't make our $10,000 goal, whatever we get will be a blessing to this project. But in addition to finances, I need you to SPREAD THE WORD!!! Send the link to this campaign to all your Facebook friends, Twitter followers, Linked In contacts, email contacts, etc. Indiegogo has made it easy to share the link...so even if you're not in a position to donate, please help me get the word out about this project!!!</p>
<p>Thank you and God Bless.</p>

 Five years later Charlene is a single mom, successful business owner, and a faithful member in her church, but she is worried about her girlfriends Portia, Keisha, and Stacey, who are dating Hollywood’s former lieutenants that are now the new bosses of The Brotherhood. She sets out to help them see that dating men in the street life is a dead end road that leads to loneliness, heartache, and even jail or death. The girls all hear what she’s saying but don’t really listen. 
 But little do they know that a perfect storm is brewing for The Brotherhood. An ongoing federal investigation, a budding street war with a rival dealer, and a very unlikely member of their organization who has become an informant for the feds, will all have severe consequences for not only the Brotherhood leadership, but also anyone connected to them, including the women who love them. 
 It’s a race against time as Charlene tries to convince her girlfriends to change their ways and abandon ship before the storm that’s brewing hits. Will she succeed? Find out as you witness this story of love, deception, danger, tragedy, and triumph. 
Who I Am
I am a Detroit based music producer, writer, and CEO of Soul Food Entertainment, LLC, an entertainment firm that specializes in all areas of media production and development. During my 20+ years in the entertainment business, I have worked with countless independent and major Gospel, Jazz, and R&B artists, either playing keyboards, producing, writing, or arranging for them. Some of my current and past clients include Dorinda Clark Cole, The 3x Grammy Award winning Clark Sisters, Fred Hammond, Warner Brothers Records, Sony/BMG Records, NBC, and EMI Records to name a few. In addition to music, my company is also developing several projects in the areas of TV, Film, Radio, as well as Fashion. Also, I have served as music director and/or production manager on several local and national stage plays, and am now stepping out with my own endeavor, which is the Diamond Girls project. I strongly believe that my years of creative and technical experience, along with a strong and experienced support team will be a major factor in the success of this project.
Why I'm Doing This Project
My desire for this project is not just to entertain, but to tell a story that hasn't been adequately told, and to deliver a message that I believe will help not only women, but also men think about the choices they make and how it affects those around them. The media paints such a glamorous and romantic picture of the street lifestyle when there's so much death and destruction attached to it. My desire is to remove the mask and show the lifestyle for what it really is...a life full of pain, disappointment, death, and lost and stolen dreams...and to show that it's never too late to change and turn things around for the better.


I NEED YOUR HELP!!!
In order to make this project happen I need you, yes YOU!!! The money you donate will go towards the production of the stage play, the documentary, and the soundtrack. We have already began production of the documentary and the soundtrack but need additional funds to complete them. Some of the expenses include:

Theater Rental
Lighting and Sound Rental
Cast and Crew (some actors and crew members will be volunteers and others will be paid professionals to ensure the quality of the production)
Marketing and Promotions (Fliers, Posters, TV and Radio Advertising, Street Team, Website Development)
Rehearsal Venue Rental
Set Design and Construction
Musicians
Video Crew (For the taping of the show)
Finishing Production of the Documentary (Filming, Editing, and Manufacturing)
Finishing Production of the CD Soundtrack (Recording, Mixing, Mastering, and Manufacturing)

For helping us with this endeavor there are several perks and benefits that I am offering, including play tickets, copies of the documentary and soundtrack, special seating at the play, as well as several perks not open to the public, such as behind the scenes footage of the production and entrance to some of the invite only events such as the Soundtrack Listening Party. A detailed list of the perks can be found on the right side of this page.


The Impact
I believe that this project will touch many lives and cause many to soul search and rethink their decisions, as well as make them laugh and be entertained. Eventually, this play will tour around the country as well as be turned into an actual full length feature film. I even plan to start a Diamond Girls non-profit organization that will help young women. But we must start somewhere and with your help we can start something that will be more than just a play, or a movie, or a soundtrack...we can start a Diamond Girls MOVEMENT!!!


Other Ways You Can Help
As you can see there are many differnt donation levels from great to small and every little bit helps and even if we don't make our $10,000 goal, whatever we get will be a blessing to this project. But in addition to finances, I need you to SPREAD THE WORD!!! Send the link to this campaign to all your Facebook friends, Twitter followers, Linked In contacts, email contacts, etc. Indiegogo has made it easy to share the link...so even if you're not in a position to donate, please help me get the word out about this project!!!
Thank you and God Bless.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h2> Who We Are</h2>
<p>Concrete Vertigo Productions is a production company that was founded in 2010 with the goal of producing Las Vegas style burlesque musicals. All Singing, All Dancing and All Sexy. The show revolves around - what else? - Brothers Grimm fairy tales - but with a sexy, contemporary twist.</p>
<p><strong><em>Grimm Girls</em></strong> will be our third and most ambitious production yet. We aim to do something different and unique within the Vancouver theatre scene. The fusing of traditional musical theatre with the art of Burlesque is not only exciting but brings different kinds of artists together under one roof.</p>
<p>The production team includes co-directors Dawn Ewen (also choreographing) and Mike Kovac, Musical Director Maddison Popov, Sound Designer David Kovac, Producer/Writer Cameron Chase and co-producers Sable Strub and Rosie Simon. The supremely talented cast includes Jacqueline Breakwell (pulling double duty as our costume designer) Sable Strub, Rosie Simon, Ranae Miller, Jeremy O'Driscoll, Mike Kovac, Ryan Bolton, Megan Solis, Ben Bilodeau, Emily Kapahi, Javia Selina, Alex Gullason, Jennifer Doan, Lauren Gula, Stephanie Liotopoulos, Kate MacQueen, Nilsen Tiefenbach and Dimitrios Stephanoy.</p>
<h3>The Show </h3>
<p><strong><em>Grimm Girls</em> </strong>aims to not only be a show, but an experience where the worlds of Burlesque and Musical Theatre fuse to create a sexy, hilarious romp in which classic Brothers Grimm fables collide. The world created will be familliar yet surprising, filled with well known characters being updated to a sexy, contemporary twist. We guarantee you have never seen Snow White, Cinderella, Red Riding Hood and the Evil Queen quite like this before.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As this is our most ambitious production to date, we are in need of a bit more funding than usual. Our large cast of 18 will be performing in the PAL Theatre in downtown Vancouver, which of course costs money, as do elaborate sets and gorgeous costumes (sequins cost a lot of money!)</p>
<p>Every penny from you backers counts towards making this production the best it can be. In exchange for your kind and generous hearts, you will receive a variety of perks. Among said perks are advanced tickets, good karma, signed posters of the cast and even the possibility of a Producer's credit! Let's be honest, who wouldn't like to throw around the ""yeah, I produced theatre"" gloat? </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong><em>Grimm Girls</em></strong> is not our first, not our second, but our third show based in Vancouver. Our first two productions, <em>Ruby Red Burlesque</em> and <em>Lost Girls of Neverland,</em> were classic tales turned on their sides (and spanked) for a new audience. Both were big hits and sold out both their runs.</p>
<p>When <em>Ruby Red Burlesque</em> was produced, we never imagined that the public would respond with such enthusiasm and support. We tried to one up ourselves with <em>Lost Girls of Neverland</em>, and we succeeded! Now, with <em>Grimm Girls</em>, we are aiming to prove that the best things come in threes. </p>
<p>There are other ways you can help if you cannot contribute money to our production. Sharing this page and getting the word out to friends, family and social networks is just as fantastic and something we appreciate with all our hearts.</p>

<p>A little bit about Rapier Wit:</p>
<p><span>Based in Toronto, ON, it was founded in 1991 by Daniel Levinson, establishing its first permanent studio in 1996.  Rapier Wit’s goal is ""to promote action-motivated theatre and the art of stage combat by training actors, stunt people, directors, and stage management in the art of theatrical violence.""</span></p>
<p>Disciplines include broadsword and shield, advanced smallsword, rapier and companion, eastern martial arts weapons, and found weapons.  Successful completion of this workshop would result in advanced recognition by Fight Directors Canada, a nonprofit educational entity dedicated to the education, development, advancement, and proficiency of action-oriented entertainment.</p>
<p>I've already secured a place to stay, brainstormed travel expenses, and am working to apply towards a work visa, so that living expenses (yay debt!) suddenly don't become impossible to support.</p>
<p>The only problem is: the workshop cost is just out of my reach.  I might be able to secure enough work to cover both the cost of living as well as the program, but the truth of the matter is, I don't think I can afford the training on my own.  That's where you come in.</p>
<p>The cost of the program is just a little under $2000, so I thought I'd round up to give the project goal a nice even number.  The money you would be pledging would just go straight to tuition, anything extra would go into the Coffee &amp; Donut Fund (food for this surprisingly metabolistic petite).</p>

Our mission is to take the themes of every piece we produce and match it to an organization that could benefit from it, whether by charitable donation or other outreach. </p>

<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>The funding we need goes specifically to the performance rental of the Parkside Lounge, our rehearsal studio space, the pay given to every actor and crew member of the production, costumes (leather pants for Tony!), royalties, marketing (including postcards and mailings to our potential audience and members of the industry), Set design (specifically the bar that's being made exclusively for our production), Props (Santa Suit for Murk, bar glasses, beverages), and Insurance among many others...</p>
<p><strong>We want you involved in the success of this project.</strong> With each donation level you receive the opportunity for priority booking to see the show, free tickets, video updates on our rehearsal and production progress, show dedications, invites to rehearsals and signed programs! Because we are a sponsored project of Fractured Atlas, your donation (at any level) will be tax deductible. </p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal the show will go on, but we'll be really in debt and that's no way to start a business that cares about our community and the world at large. Every penny that we do earn will go to making sure that we get all the rehearsal that the director and actors need to make sure they are prepared and performing at the best of their ability and that the Parkside Lounge venue is paid. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
Tarzana Elementary School has no funding for drama, leaving the kids with little or no theatrically creative outlet. We are reaching out to all of you who understand how important it is to keep imagination alive in the minds of young kids.</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
We are looking to raise $1500 in order to offer ten children partial scholarships for our after-school program and then have $500 left over for costumes, props, a set and theatre equipment.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If we raise more than our goal, that extra money will go toward future years and developing a drama program within the school, in hopes of making theatre even more available to the students.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>What do you get? There aren't many things we can offer as far as ""perks"" go, we're still working on those, but you can totally get our undying love and gratitude...and the knowledge that there is a wonderfully creative child out there thanking you for the ability to delve into imagination. :)</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Theatre promotes creativity and imagination, which are some of the most important parts of growing up. It allows children to grow, build confidence and expand their critical thinking outside of the normal ""box."" Without creativity and imagination, things like the internet, movies, the computer, and even major breakthroughs in science would not have been or continue to be possible.</p>
<p>Kids need to be allowed to use their imaginations and encouraged to grow in a creative space, so offering ten children partial scholarships for the program would open doors for some students for whom this may not have been an option for in the past. </p>
</div>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't donate, we understand. These are tough times, but we'd love for you to put a blast out on your facebook page, send an email to someone you know, or just tell someone about our campaign.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In 2011, the RST expands to Manhattan, where we will be working on a multi-floor, site-specific production of Hamlet in conjunction with the Tank for their first-ever Theater at the Tank series.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We are simultaneously launching an educational outreach with a series of workshops entitled ""Classical Relevance: Old Stuff and Why It Matters,"" where we partner with NYC schools to bring Shakespeare to after-school programs and students in Brooklyn and other boroughs.  With the money we raise, we hope to provide free tickets and talkbacks for students who want to delve deeper into the world of Shakespeare, and continue developing relationships with students interested in classical work to foster a new generation of innovative classical theater.</p>

The RST proudly brings newly re-imagined classics to  unusual spaces and diverse audiences. In order to do so, we depend on the support of those invaluable collaborators who stand with us in pushing the dialog of the theatre into public space and the public consciousness.



The Impact
In 2011, the RST expands to Manhattan, where we will be working on a multi-floor, site-specific production of Hamlet in conjunction with the Tank for their first-ever Theater at the Tank series.  

We are simultaneously launching an educational outreach with a series of workshops entitled ""Classical Relevance: Old Stuff and Why It Matters,"" where we partner with NYC schools to bring Shakespeare to after-school programs and students in Brooklyn and other boroughs.  With the money we raise, we hope to provide free tickets and talkbacks for students who want to delve deeper into the world of Shakespeare, and continue developing relationships with students interested in classical work to foster a new generation of innovative classical theater.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Kansas has a reputation... and it's not a good one. Whether it's the topic of evolution or the arts, we've gotten a lot of bad press. It's our firm belief that lack of artistic opportunity in the state of Kansas will lead to another generation of boring, selfish, television watchers. Kansas needs to make opportunities to learn a creative skill - and that's where the Kansas Improvisation Foundation comes in. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The KIF will create opportunities for the people of Kansas to be exposed to the many varieties of improvisational acting. KIF will use its funds to give scholarships to take improv classes, to bring in outstanding teachers from other cities, and to provide classes and performances to areas with no other access to this kind of art form.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The KIF is just getting started, and needs funding to make its launch official - that means it needs 501(c)3 status to be able to apply for grants and other help. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Don't let the forces of evil win. Help spread the fun and skill of improv all over the state of Kansas!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>In order to obtain 501(c)3 status, we need $20 to file in the state of Kansas as a non-profit. We need $400 to file with the IRS, and we need $100 for the legal fees and fund-raising charges to help make this happen. We're made up of current improv professionals that want to see the art grow, and are helping out with their talents and resources.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>No matter how much you're able to give (even zero...), you can help out this great cause by sharing the campaign with others you know that love improv, art, acting, and stopping the flow of ignorance. Every little bit will help make this organization a reality! Use the share tools on this site, post it on Facebook, print it out and mail it to your elderly relatives. Let's make some noise!<br/></p>

</div></div>","Our Story
As two theatre professionals living, working and raising families here in Peekskill, Katie Schmidt Feder and Sol Miranda found ourselves dreaming of a journey:  We had both left NYC several years ago, put some of our artistic aspirations on hold to raise young families, to create homes and to find a community.  Peekskill inspires us with its diversity, its energy, its tenacity.  The strong presence of artists here and the studios and galleries which support visual artists are a great asset to the city. 
During our time in this area, however, working in various capacities as directors, performers and arts instructors – it has become obvious that Peekskill lacks a true home for its performing artist community.  Despite the beautiful renovation of the Paramount Theatre, the venue lacks wing space, fly space, suitable dressing rooms, a scenic or costume shop or rehearsal/studio capacity and hosts a house too large for intimate or experimental productions. 
For this reason, we came to the decision one year ago to embark on a journey of research, outreach and fundraising with the ultimate goal of creating a performing and literary arts home in Peekskill.   We have met with city officials, the Chamber Director, local businesses, community members and several performing arts groups from Peekskill and surrounding communities, many who seek a permanent home for their companies.
 
To bring greater awareness to our endeavor, demonstrate our abilities to gather, produce and organize, as well as hopefully inspire, entertain and bring many people to our wonderful downtown businesses, we have proposed PEESKILL's FIRST FALL PERFORMING ARTS FESTIVAL.  

The Impact
We need to raise $2,000 by mid-August to combine with our other sponsorships, to move forward with this Festival.
 
We want to demonstrate to the community, to possible donors, foundations as well as the City adminstration of Peekskill and surrounding communities that Peekskill can and will support a lively performing arts scene.  (Also, we hope that others will support us from afar!)
 
This festival will in many ways be a preview of the scene we hope to create in our facility once developed.  This facility would house 2-3 theatres of varying size from a very small 75 seat intimate theatre/lecture hall to a larger expiramental space that could double as an creative event facility.  We would also have rehearsal rooms, practice/music lesson rooms, shared set and costume shops and storage, writing rooms, a children's craft and sewing room,  a gallery, perhaps a cafe and small retail shops. 
 
By supporting this festival, you are supporting the ultimate vision of the space. 
 
What We Need & What You Get
 

With the $2,000 earned from this campaign, we can do the following:
 
Secure the booking of the show which will anchor to our festival, LA CUCARACHITA MARTINA, a family puppet rock 'n roll musical in Spanish and English by Teatro Sea from New York City.   Your contribution will ensure that this quality production will be accessable and affordable to children in our community and will bring all families in the commmunity together.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Les Petites Taquines formed in November of 2008. Les Petites Taquines translates as “the little flirts”, and we continue to flirt with inovation, possibility, and the boundaries of dance style and form.The Company first appeared in Doktor Luke Productions’  <em>Wintergarten Cabaret.</em> Later that year the company performed pieces in <em>Vintage Valentine</em> (Stones Throw Productions) and were featured in <em>A Mid Winter Romance</em> (XuaXua Productions) . The group is defined by its versatility in dance styles; with a foundation in classical technique each member also has there own specialty whether in contemporary, tap, broadway and clowning adding a richness and diversity to the company. To date, all of Les Petites Taquines pieces have been choreographed by company members making the pieces uniquely ours: our voice, our movement, our expression.  <br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>""When I was, Qui Je Suis"" is a premiere of a new production we have been rehearsing for the past year. This show is about growing up, about coming to terms with who you were and embracing who you are. Through movement we explore the journey of growing up as a comedy, a tragedy, and a fairytale. We strive to connect to our audience, to move them, to make them laugh, and to give them hope. <br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to pay for our theatre venue, our lighting and costume designer, cover printing and marketing costs, and pay for prop and costume materials.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Every year, for the last 9 years, we have an intense movement of theater public and productions during the Hollywood Fringe Festival.</p>
<p>With the objective of offering the latin public and spanish speakers, plus the general public - that can still understand the play through subtitles - a cultural experience, we are happy to bring to The Broadwater Theater stage, ""Paisaje Marino con Tiburones y Bailarina"".</p>
<p><br/>Ben, a lonely writer, fears to be alone. Tracy, a ballerina with no balance, fears to be loved. He can´t seem to take concrete actions towards his goals. She is always destroying everything she touches. This dance of care and insecurity, trust and vulnerability, staying and leaving, may be just that addictive cycle of killing and giving birth to our true selves - those never ending waves we are all afraid to live in. The world is full of sharks, isn´t it?</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Do you know what are the basic costs of doing a theater production?</p>
<ul>
<li>First we paid the Inscription of the Festival.</li>
<li>Then we paid the copyrights for the author + the translation.</li>
<li>Then we book a venue with insurance.</li>
<li>Marketing: poster, art, flyers, social media, program of the play, Fringe website, Fringe magazine.</li>
<li>Finally, rehearse! It costs to drive around L.A., right?</li>
<li>Scenario + costumes!! (we had to buy a smoke machine and a record player, isn´t this fun?)</li>
<li>Transportation for the scenario.</li>
<li>People to work: actors, directors, producer, set designer, light designer, box office, stage managers...</li>
<li>There is always something that happens in the middle of the way... (lets hope it´s cheap!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, it´s a lot to do! And we do all of this for the sake of having fun with you at the theater! You just gotta sit and enjoy!  :D</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>DATES:</strong></i></p>
<p><strong>JUNE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Friday, 15th - 11 pm</strong></p>
<p><strong>Saturday, 16th - 8:30pm </strong></p>
<p><strong>Saturday, 23rd - 9 pm</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sunday, 3rd - 4pm</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sunday 24th - 2:30pm</strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Latin community is half of California state, do you guys know that?<br/>We want to offer cultural service, breaking as many barriers as possible:</p>
<p><strong>You can come to the theater! You will not have problems with the language! </strong></p>
<p><strong>Plus, it is very cheap!!</strong></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Every year, for the last 9 years, we have an intense movement of theater public and productions during the Hollywood Fringe Festival.
With the objective of offering the latin public and spanish speakers, plus the general public - that can still understand the play through subtitles - a cultural experience, we are happy to bring to The Broadwater Theater stage, ""Paisaje Marino con Tiburones y Bailarina"".
Ben, a lonely writer, fears to be alone. Tracy, a ballerina with no balance, fears to be loved. He can´t seem to take concrete actions towards his goals. She is always destroying everything she touches. This dance of care and insecurity, trust and vulnerability, staying and leaving, may be just that addictive cycle of killing and giving birth to our true selves - those never ending waves we are all afraid to live in. The world is full of sharks, isn´t it?

 
What We Need & What You Get
Do you know what are the basic costs of doing a theater production?

First we paid the Inscription of the Festival.
Then we paid the copyrights for the author + the translation.
Then we book a venue with insurance.
Marketing: poster, art, flyers, social media, program of the play, Fringe website, Fringe magazine.
Finally, rehearse! It costs to drive around L.A., right?
Scenario + costumes!! (we had to buy a smoke machine and a record player, isn´t this fun?)
Transportation for the scenario.
People to work: actors, directors, producer, set designer, light designer, box office, stage managers...
There is always something that happens in the middle of the way... (lets hope it´s cheap!)

Yes, it´s a lot to do! And we do all of this for the sake of having fun with you at the theater! You just gotta sit and enjoy!  :D
 
 
DATES:
JUNE
Friday, 15th - 11 pm
Saturday, 16th - 8:30pm 
Saturday, 23rd - 9 pm
Sunday, 3rd - 4pm
Sunday 24th - 2:30pm
 

The Impact
Latin community is half of California state, do you guys know that?We want to offer cultural service, breaking as many barriers as possible:
You can come to the theater! You will not have problems with the language! 
Plus, it is very cheap!!
We won a Hollywood Fringe Festival Scholarship of $500 for being a project that contributes to the cultural diversity of the festival!!

<p><i>xoxo moongirl</i> is an autobiographically inspired circus fantasia that incorporates breathtaking aerials and acrobatics to tell the story of a girl in a troubled home, and her flight to the moon to escape and prevail. Directed and co-created by Almanac co-founder Ben Grinberg and with created with input from an ensemble of artists over almost two years, the show is critically acclaimed, honest, and emotional. Barrymore award winner Mel Hsu composed a haunting and at times groovy original score for the show, which she performs live on Cello, Guitar, Vocals, and Looper Pedal. Amanda Jenson offers lighting design and Mia Rocchio co-directs.</p>
<p>During the solo performance, internationally acclaimed acrobat Nicole Burgio shares stories from her childhood, at times inviting audience volunteers to join the theatrics. As the story unfolds, Burgio uses the virtuosic performance languages of aerial circus arts, dance, hand balancing, and a hint of magic to tell her on-going story of survival, resilience, and overcoming abuse.</p>
<p>After premiering in Philadelphia for a 3 day workshop performance in June, 2018, Almanac has taken <i>xoxo moongirl</i> to Mexico City, where it was performed entirely in Spanish. Then, in June, 2019, the show was reworked and remounted for 12 performances, where it was Barrymore recommended and critically acclaimed. In August, we're taking the show to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival -- one of the largest performance festivals in the English-speaking world, at Assembly -- one of the most prestigious venues at the festival. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><i>xoxo moongirl</i> is one of Almanac's 11 full length works that combine dance, theatre, and contemporary circus in the service of important stories. The show is stylistically innovative and inspiring, as circus, and the strength it requires, becomes a clear metaphor for Nicole's resilience in the face of trauma. The show has been very well received by audiences and critics alike in Philadelphia, and we are excited to bring it to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, where we think that it can have a big impact at the Festival, and hopefully also attract the attention of other producers and curators who would want to bring the show to other places and other communities. We've been accepted to perform at Assembly as part of their curated line-up of shows alongside some of the biggest names in circus and theatre. </p>
<p>Here are some reviews of the show in its Philadelphia productions: </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The Edinburgh Fringe is huge. With over 3,000 different shows happening in just over three weeks, it is difficult to stand out in the line-up. There is a good likelihood that some nights, we will be performing for audiences of 10 or fewer people. Yet we really believe in this show and in our ability to attract the attention of press, media, producers, and audiences alike. </p>

In August, we're taking the show to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival -- one of the largest performance festivals in the English-speaking world, at Assembly -- one of the most prestigious venues at the festival. 


The Impact
xoxo moongirl is one of Almanac's 11 full length works that combine dance, theatre, and contemporary circus in the service of important stories. The show is stylistically innovative and inspiring, as circus, and the strength it requires, becomes a clear metaphor for Nicole's resilience in the face of trauma. The show has been very well received by audiences and critics alike in Philadelphia, and we are excited to bring it to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, where we think that it can have a big impact at the Festival, and hopefully also attract the attention of other producers and curators who would want to bring the show to other places and other communities. We've been accepted to perform at Assembly as part of their curated line-up of shows alongside some of the biggest names in circus and theatre. 
Here are some reviews of the show in its Philadelphia productions: 
Broad Street Review (2019)
thINKingDANCE
Philadelphia Dance Journal (2019)
ToiTime
Philadelphia Dance Journal (2018)
 

Risks & Challenges
The Edinburgh Fringe is huge. With over 3,000 different shows happening in just over three weeks, it is difficult to stand out in the line-up. There is a good likelihood that some nights, we will be performing for audiences of 10 or fewer people. Yet we really believe in this show and in our ability to attract the attention of press, media, producers, and audiences alike. 

Spread the word!
Thank you so much for viewing this campaign and reading this far! Please do consider making a contribution and be sure to review the great perks that the team has assembled for you. 
Whether or not you're able to make a donation, please share this campaign on social media or via email. If you know anyone who will be in Edinburgh in August, please let them know about the show, and encourage them to buy tickets!
Thank you so much for your support. As always, we couldn't do this without you.

We are a club for actors, dancers, singers, directors, choreographers, playwrights and anybody else who has a passion for any of the performing arts. All levels of experience and majors are welcome! 

With your support, we're hoping to earn enough money to pay for our performance space, as well as all the props, costumes, and other production expenses that go into making showcases a success! All your kind donations keep the showcase a free event for all students, faculty, friends, and family wishing to attend and support the cast members. 




Our Spring Showcase:
With all that in mind, we hope you come check out this quarter's amazing set of student-written works:

""Daddy Issues,"" by Shubha Arehalli

""Daddy Issues"" is a piece written by Shubha Arehalli and directed by Sarah Brown and Rahi Suryawanshi. Here's the premise: It’s Father’s Day and a family reunion. But when you’re one of the many illegitimate children of Zeus, family reunions take on a whole new level of crazy. Cursed by her stepmother, Hera, and grasping for some sense of normalcy, Phoebe struggles to hold together the chaos that is her family. 



 ""Horrors of the Female Body,"" by Deanna Siegel
""Horrors of the Female Body"" is an autobiographical piece written by Deanna Siegel and directed by Deanna Siegel and Kendall Larsen about dealing with the treatment of endometriosis, relationships, American Jewish culture and womanhood.

<p><strong>Why Seven Santas?</strong></p>
<p>We chose 'Seven Santas' to kick-start 2017, as our productions of 'The Eight: Reindeer Monologues' proved very popular and we adored the writing style from Jeff Goode.<br/>This play allows us to perform the dark humour that we enjoy so much whilst also exploring darker themes of Christmas.</p>
<p>This production delves into the psyche of Santa Claus and seven representations of him; each with their own views on what Christmas means. Set in a Alcoholics Anonymous meeting lead by the biggest drunk of them all: Mrs Claus, the Santas own up to past experiences, addictions and dark, dark secrets.</p>
<p>This production is a dark-comedy with adult themes and language - not for the faint-hearted!</p>
<p><strong>Gallows Productions</strong></p>
<p>We are a young theatre company based in Hampshire, England with drive and passion for creating theatre. Gallows Productions was established in 2013 to provide unconventional and provocative theatre that challenges audiences, whilst bettering our artist’s experience and confidence within the theatre industry. <br/><br/>Our Aims as a company are to  offer unique opportunities and practical experiences within theatre and performance for new artists and to create unconventional and thought-provoking theatre for both new and established audiences.</p>
<p>Gallows Productions don't receive funding like many other theatre companies - we have made it work on our own terms through nothing short of blind faith, endless perseverance and sheer determination. ​However, as we embark on the next stage of our journey to bring interesting and creative theatre to audiences, we need all the help that we can get.</p>
<p>This campaign is extremely important to us as a company as this gives us the chance to improve our production value, connect with our audiences, give you the best that we can be.</p>
<p><strong>How Your Contribution Helps</strong></p>
<p>We aim to raise a total of £500 for this production to help with costs such as:</p>
<p>- Set, props and costume<br/>- Theatre usage<br/>- Licensing fees<br/>- Marketing (printing, advertising, etc.)</p>
<p>This will also give us more resources to use as they help us create an immersive setting for our characters and our audience. By contributing, you are actively supporting your local creators and helping us to progress our company and furthermore, our passions and your entertainment, to new heights.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Dancing Queerly is an annual dance festival for the LGBTQIA+ community, its friends and allies. Because people approach dance for a variety of reasons and with different intents, Dancing Queerly provides queer-centric dance events for students and professionals, audience members and enthusiasts. Founded on the belief that the queer community is largely underserved in traditional dance spaces, Dancing Queerly gives LGBTQIA+ dancers and dancemakers the opportunity to create and perform for an LGBTQIA+ centered audience, and invites community members to explore and expand their relationship to dance as audience members and participants.  </p>
</div><div>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">The 2019 festival features artists including Lilly Valore (Boston, MA), Nick Daniels (Pittsburgh, PA), Toby MacNutt (Burlington, VT), Queens With A Mission (Boston, MA), and Kareem Khubchandani (Boston, MA).</span></p>
<p>We are putting the 2019 festival together with the help of some foundation support, but we also need your help to pay for space rental, technicians, artists, travel expenses and publicity. Extra funds raised will support the festival going into 2020 and beyond, and fund additional free tickets and workshops for community members who are unable to pay.</p>
<h3>More about us</h3>
<p>Producers Maggie Cee and Michael Winward met while dancing together in the 2016 and discovered a mutual passion for sharing dance with a wide range of audiences and for giving LGBTQIA+ audiences, performers, and choreographers an opportunity to experience work that reflects and/or embodies queer experiences.</p>
<p><br/>In June of 2017, we co-produced our first concert, “A Queer Time and Place”, at The Dance Complex in Central Square.</p>
<p><br/>With support from The Boston Foundation, in 2018 we were able to expand two sold out shows and five well-attended workshops, approximately 200 people participated in Dancing Queerly as students, audience members, and panel discussion attendees. </p>

<h3>Our Company</h3>
<p>The Mimesis Theatre Project is a devised musical theatre company.  ""Devised"" means that our actors and collaborators are imperative in the construction of our pieces, and ""Musical Theatre"" in that all of our work includes dance, text, and music.  </p>
<h3>Our First Season</h3>
<p>In 2017, The Mimesis Theatre Project will be launching its first season with three freshly created pieces:  </p>
<p><strong><u><i>1. Open Forum. </i>APRIL 15th @ 3pm. The 92nd Street Y.</u></strong>  </p>
<p><i>     </i>Three artists devise a theatre piece with their voices at the forefront.   </p>
<p><u><strong>2. <i>Resurrexit. </i>MAY 26th @ 10pm. Dixon Place. </strong></u></p>
<p>     An exploration of identity, faith, and the power within.  </p>
<p><u><strong><i>3. The Chosen One</i>. JULY 1st. Garner Arts Center/August 1st-15th. Piknik Theatre Festival. </strong></u></p>
<p>     Using The Torah and Superhero mythology to explore good, evil, and the ""other.""  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>In order to get off the ground as a company  and produce our first season, we need to raise $11,000.<strong>  </strong></p>
<p>We are using this campaign specifically to raise the <strong><u>$7,500</u></strong> needed in order to <strong><u>SUPPORT OUR PERFORMERS AND COLLABORATORS </u></strong>with housing, travel, and sustainable compensation for their time with company:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Forum (3 Artists, 1 Director): $1,000</li>
<li>Resurrexit (7 Artists, 1 Director, 1 Music Director, 1 Choreographer): $2,500</li>

<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>By donating to this campaign, you will be giving emerging artists the ability to bring their work to life.  </p>
<p>The Mimesis Theatre Project was established in order to explore what is shared between all artists and all peoples. By creating collaborative efforts on our stage, we hope to incite a collaborative effort in our audience, bringing peoples and communities together in order to communicate through stories and self-expression.  </p>
<p>As stated above, I think at this time in our human history it is most important that we sit down with people unlike ourselves, look each other in the eyes, and listen to each other's stories.  I know your donation will go directly towards creating work where this is possible. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Dream to Reality</h3>
<p>Without your support, we run the risk of not being able to get off the ground at all. Your donations are imperative at this juncture.</p>
<p>""The word Mimesis has been with me since I was 15. Very plainly, mimesis means 'to imitate,' but I was drawn to the word for a more theatrical translation: ' to bend reality.' As I have grown, so has my understanding of the word's magnitude. By imitating our surroundings, our stories, and our lives, we have the capability to bend the reality within which we live.  The theatre is powerful, and Mimesis is its tool. This project has been a dream of mine for over a decade, and I cannot believe how close we are to bringing it to life. Now, more than ever, are the arts necessary to open communication and bring us all closer together.  Help us bend our current reality in to a stronger, brighter and more compassionate tomorrow.

Today, Blasted continues to shake the nerves and sensibilities of its audiences with its savagery as well as its compassion for the lowest depths of human desperation, pain, and ultimate redemption. What We Need
Blasted is Off the Grid's largest-scaled production yet. 4 years ago we were performing/squatting in a school basement, wearing things found in our closet, and opening/closing the same night. This September we'll be making our home at the Calderwood Pavilion at the BCA, hiring a whole design team, and will play a limited three week engagement. We've come a long way, but we still need help.
Alexis Scheer is this years recipient of the New World School of the Arts Alumni Foundation Inspiration Grant. The grant, along with ticket revenue, will help pay for rights and most of the artists involved in the production.
Your contribution via IndieGoGo will specifically go towards:


Space rental (this is our big ticket item)
Fight Choreographer (help keep us safe!)
Designer fees
Set materials
Costumes
Props
Poster/program printing

Any funds raised beyond our goal will pay admin fees taken by Indiegogo and Fractured Atlas (10% of everything we raise), and then go towards our marketing efforts.

What You GetWe've got an excellent assortment of perks for all levels of giving, including:
An Off the Grid tshirt for you to wear around town.
Tickets to the show.
Private pre-show reception with John Kuntz.
An all-inclusive dinner for you and your guests with John, Chris, Alexis, and Maurice. We're pretty cool people. This is a total steal.
Other Ways To Lend A HandWe know not everyone is in a position to give. Good news is there are other ways you can support us!

Come see the show! Bring a friend. Bring a date. Bring your mom. Don't bring your child though. This play contains graphic scenesof physical and sexual violence and nudity. Not intended for audience members under age 17.

<h3>The Center of an Epic, in Portland Oregon</h3>
<p><b>Synopsis: </b></p>
<p>In the dead of night, Troy
was massacred. By morning, all men are dead, and the city burns. The women and
children left alive try to cope with the new ‘normal.’ The occupying Greek
power grapples with the aftershocks of a war that lasted ten years.  </p>
<p>Since its first production in 415 BCE, <i>The Trojan Women </i>has
been celebrated as a titan of world literature. This fresh adaptation pays
homage to civilian victims of war, and honors the struggle individual soldiers
endure to keep light in their hearts during and after duty.</p>
<p>Already in development for more than two years, <i>Women of Troy </i>is now moving into its
next stage! We invite you to join our campaign to produce the world premiere of
this exhilarating new version with an inaugural run of 15 performances in Portland, Oregon. </p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Participate</h3>
</div>
<p><i>Women of Troy</i>
began development in February 2014 with actors and staff donating their time
and expertise. Taking part in this campaign will ensure that the actors, technicians,
and other collaborators working on <i>Women
of Troy </i>will be compensated for their beautiful, rigorous, and inspired
work.  </p>

Synopsis: 
In the dead of night, Troy
was massacred. By morning, all men are dead, and the city burns. The women and
children left alive try to cope with the new ‘normal.’ The occupying Greek
power grapples with the aftershocks of a war that lasted ten years.  
Since its first production in 415 BCE, The Trojan Women has
been celebrated as a titan of world literature. This fresh adaptation pays
homage to civilian victims of war, and honors the struggle individual soldiers
endure to keep light in their hearts during and after duty.
Already in development for more than two years, Women of Troy is now moving into its
next stage! We invite you to join our campaign to produce the world premiere of
this exhilarating new version with an inaugural run of 15 performances in Portland, Oregon. 
   Participate

Women of Troy
began development in February 2014 with actors and staff donating their time
and expertise. Taking part in this campaign will ensure that the actors, technicians,
and other collaborators working on Women
of Troy will be compensated for their beautiful, rigorous, and inspired
work.  
Funds raised will also cover important necessities on the
business side of a theatre production, such as rehearsal and performance space,
printing for posters and programs, as well as props and costumes.
Impact 
When a story stands the test of time for more than 2,000
years, it is an excellent starting point for mind-blowing theatre! Under the
ugliness of war and brutality, Women of
Troy is a beautiful story about individual strength. It is about personal
courage and holding on to hope in the face of extreme loss, suffering, and
fear. Inasmuch as any myth will always be about ‘Now,’ Women of Troy inspires by showing people who keep going long past
their breaking points. That is always a real life victory. As such, the project
is about giving a gift of optimism.



What do you get in
return? (Besides warm, fuzzy feelings?) 
This is truly a story worth telling. We want to thank each

set of THANK YOU PERKS.

</h3> <p>UrbanArias has been producing critically acclaimed work for five years. Our mission is to bring new audiences to the opera by programming work that is SHORT, CURRENT, and RELEVANT. Past successes include PAUL'S CASE, an opera we produced in both DC and New York City about a gay teen, and BLUE VIOLA, an NEA-supported commission which featured inner-city African-American characters.</p>
<p>We need to raise just a bit more money to completely fund our production of AS ONE and put us over the top. We want to move people with a beautiful story of a transgender protagonist, and educate people about transgender issues. This short opera, AS ONE, will bring these issues to a whole new public.</p>
<p>With your contribution, you will help bring a trans person's story to life, to share that story with people who have not heard it, and who know very little about the issues facing this community. AS ONE highlights many stepping stones on a trans person's journey: the confusion they feel, the censure they experience from educators and family, and the threat of violence they face from an ignorant and hostile public. And yet, our protagonist transcends all this, finds acceptance of herself, and true inner peace. <br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Your contribution will fund our production.<br/>
</h3>Opera is expensive. We pay our singers, our instrumentalists, our stage director, our scenic, costume and lighting designers, our conductor, our stage crew, and our stage manager. We build the set, make the costumes, rent lights. Trans filmmaker Kimberly Reed has created a film that goes with AS ONE - we need to rent a sophisticated projector to show it. <br/><br/>Ticket sales account for about 20-25% of our total production costs; this is normal for opera. So we need tax-deductible donations to make up the rest.<br/><br/>For a $100 donation, you get a fabulous UrbanArias t-shirt! These sell out at all of our shows - simply but beautifully made, they feature our sleek logo on the front and our subversive motto on the back - ""If you're looking for a quickie, this is your opera company.""<br/><br/>$75 gets you a poster created by top DC marketing firm LMO, SIGNED by the cast; $50 gets you YOUR OWN NAME sung in an opera video by our cast.<br/><br/>Feeling even more generous? $150 gets you a private voice lesson with classically-trained Broadway veteran Susan Derry; $200 gets you a conducting lesson with UrbanArias founder Robert Wood; $250 gets you a special sneak preview of AS ONE at one of our dress rehearsals, and $500 gets you tickets to the show - PLUS DRINKS!<br/><br/>Every dollar we raise will go to our advocacy through art. And because we are a non-profit, every dollar you contribute is fully tax-deductible to the extent provided by law.<br/><ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>Art Changes Lives. Music Changes Minds.<br/>
</h3> <p>Small initiatives can open minds one at a time. Major news stories reach millions of people, but an intimate theatrical production gets at your heart and soul.

<p>AS ONE informs and educates people about the Transgender community, and arouses compassion. Your donation helps that compassion happen.</p>
<p>UrbanArias is no stranger to LGBT issues and causes. Our world premiere of PAUL'S CASE got stunning reviews in the New York Times, the Wall St. Journal, and the Washington Post.

<h3>In Short...</h3>
<p>In the few short semesters since the creation Temple University's chapter of Alpha Psi Omega, the National Honorary Theatre Society, they have received more requests than they could count for increased opportunities to do undergraduate work. From this, the Backstage Season was born. A season that runs paralell to the Temple Mainstage season and serves to enhance the quality and consistency of student works in Theater.</p>
<p>Shakespeare's <em>Julius Caesar</em> is the first show we want to tackle. But unfortunately, the department doesn't have the funds needed for us to fully realize this work. That is where you lovely people come in!</p>
<p>As far as our concept for the show; it's pretty snazzy. We're doing the show on the front steps of our theatre - where we feel so at home that we consider it our city hall. We are setting it in modern society and gender bending, making it more accessible to the modern audience. We also want to command the space: To be in your face with the political nature of the show, reflected in the presidential elections the week our show runs. We also want to bring Shakespeare to people who may just happen across it. In this way, we hope to provide opportunities for people involved in the show, as well as people experiencing the show.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need money. Sad, but true.</p>
<p>We are looking at a $550 budget for our entire production - lights, sets, costumes, etc. That's not a ton of money, but we know we will be able to put up a splendid show for that amount.</p>
<p>The technical aspects of the show is where the money will end up going - whatever we raise. Lumber, costumes, electric rentals - all that fun stuff we need to perform.</p>
<p>However much we raise - that is our budget. If we only raise $100, then we will do a very minimalistic show. If we raise over our expected budget - the excess will go toward any unprecidented expences and then be tucked away to support more student projects next semester. And belive me, there will be more this spring. And, not to fret, you will hear about them!</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>Hi!  I'm Abby, and I'm a professional hula hooper.  In 2008, I left an 8-year marketing career to pursue my hoop dance business.  My company specializes in professional, hand-made dance hoops for fitness and fun.  I also run a performance troupe, teach hoop dance classes, and entertain children at birthday parties and special events.</p>
<p>This campaign is to raise funds for a kids' hoop dance DVD.  This project is wildly important to me because it will impact the lives of children by promoting happy, healthy play with hoops.  It will also promote creativity and self confidence through music and dance.</p>
<p><em>In a far away land, there is a place called Hooperville... a magical, colorful world that's united by love and imagination.  In Hooperville, monsters roam the town, but they aren't the type of monsters  you've ever seen before.  These happy, creative beings are called Hoola Monsters, and they have special powers.</em></p>
<p><em>When Hoola Monsters spin their magic hoops, wishes are granted and dreams come true.  But right now, the monsters are trapped!  They exist only in the mind of their creator.</em></p>
<p><em>This is a campaign to FREE THE HOOLA MONSTERS so they can spread joy, good health and confidence to children all over the world.</em></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I currently have one investor on board (Yippie!!!) but I still need to generate funds for attorney's fees, which will support operating agreements, talent contracts, music licenses, and work for hire forms.</p>
<p>I will also put funds raised towards grassroots marketing efforts to promote the DVD. I have been invited to go on tour with a national, traveling music festival in the summer of 2013.  There, I will introduce hoop dance to tens of thousands of kids at every show!  I'll do this by performing on stage and selling the DVD at the merchandise booth (where I will also offer mini lessons to the kids)!  This is a great opportunity to promote the DVD, but unfortunately, there isn't a performance art budget available.  So, part of the funds generated with this campaign will go towards the tour.</p>
<p>This campaign will also support hoop-making help.  Up until now, I have been hand-crafting every hoop that's sold through my company.  I have a team of people ready to jump in and assist, and I need to have funds available for compensation and materials. (Professional hoops will be sold with the DVD).</p>
<p>I have a big vision for this project.  This includes original art and set design elements, as well as fantastic videography and editing. </p>

Hi!  I'm Abby, and I'm a professional hula hooper.  In 2008, I left an 8-year marketing career to pursue my hoop dance business.  My company specializes in professional, hand-made dance hoops for fitness and fun.  I also run a performance troupe, teach hoop dance classes, and entertain children at birthday parties and special events.
This campaign is to raise funds for a kids' hoop dance DVD.  This project is wildly important to me because it will impact the lives of children by promoting happy, healthy play with hoops.  It will also promote creativity and self confidence through music and dance.
In a far away land, there is a place called Hooperville... a magical, colorful world that's united by love and imagination.  In Hooperville, monsters roam the town, but they aren't the type of monsters  you've ever seen before.  These happy, creative beings are called Hoola Monsters, and they have special powers.
When Hoola Monsters spin their magic hoops, wishes are granted and dreams come true.  But right now, the monsters are trapped!  They exist only in the mind of their creator.
This is a campaign to FREE THE HOOLA MONSTERS so they can spread joy, good health and confidence to children all over the world.


What We Need & What You Get
I currently have one investor on board (Yippie!!!) but I still need to generate funds for attorney's fees, which will support operating agreements, talent contracts, music licenses, and work for hire forms.
I will also put funds raised towards grassroots marketing efforts to promote the DVD. I have been invited to go on tour with a national, traveling music festival in the summer of 2013.  There, I will introduce hoop dance to tens of thousands of kids at every show!  I'll do this by performing on stage and selling the DVD at the merchandise booth (where I will also offer mini lessons to the kids)!  This is a great opportunity to promote the DVD, but unfortunately, there isn't a performance art budget available.  So, part of the funds generated with this campaign will go towards the tour.
This campaign will also support hoop-making help.  Up until now, I have been hand-crafting every hoop that's sold through my company.  I have a team of people ready to jump in and assist, and I need to have funds available for compensation and materials. (Professional hoops will be sold with the DVD).
I have a big vision for this project.  This includes original art and set design elements, as well as fantastic videography and editing. 
If I don't reach my entire goal, the funds will still go to the DVD project.  As mentioned, I have one investor who is already committed.  The DVD is happening, and the sooner I can generate the remaining 10K, the quicker we can move forward with the project.  We are so excited to get started!  I should also mention the DVD will be very movement-centered/ participatory. Children will get a great workout!
So, what's in it for you?  I'm offering all kinds of great incentives... from hand-made children's dance hoops to early releases of the DVD and music CDs!  I will be extending invitations to our DVD launch party, with special hoop dance performances, giveaways, live music and appearances by the Hoola Monsters!  To learn more about my company, check out www.hoolamonsters.com

<h4>Hello and thank you for checking out my page! This little acrobat-turned-aerialist needs your help! If I wish to achieve my goal of becoming a full fledged aerialist, I'll need a trapeze to call my own. Come autumn, I will no longer have access to the equipment I've been training on, which could mean the untimely demise of my dream. I'm only a trapeze away from truly taking flight. Read on to learn more!<br/>
</h4>
<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Eight years ago, I made a choice that would forever change my future, and alter my life in ways I never thought imaginable. That choice was to follow a dream. But not just any dream. It was one of those big dreams that you keep tucked away inside because most people would shake their heads and chuckle, or else tell you that it could never be done, so why bother? For me that dream was to be in the circus.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>And so, in 2003 I was accepted at the National Circus School of Montreal, one of the best circus schools in the world! I wanted nothing more than to be an aerialist, but in the end, the school had other plans for me. I started off on aerial silks, but it wasn't a good fit for me. After some happy accidents, I found my way to the German wheel. I still wanted to minor in an aerial discipline while at school, but by that point, it was decided that I didn't have the flexibility and just wasn't cut out for aerials. I best stick to the ground like a good little acrobat.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I'd be lying if I said I wasn't completely smitten with German wheel. But it would also be a lie to say that the little voice in my heart that started me on my circus journey ever stopped looking skyward and sighing. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>And so, after working as an acrobat for the last five years, I've decided to take hold of my dream once more and shape it in the way I've always imagined. I'm going to become an aerialist and specialize in static trapeze!<br/></p>
<br/>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact<br/>
</h3>
<p>Completely changing disciplines may seem like a huge task, but the reality is, once you've started circus work, your base becomes so strong that every time you take on a new discipline, the learning time becomes shorter and shorter. What really makes a difference is the time you are able to commit to learning the new skill, and the resources available.</p>
<p><br/>Leaving school has meant losing access to
coaching and equipment, which makes it difficult and sometimes dangerous to
develop new skills. The fees for hiring private coaches and
renting training space add up startlingly fast and most people can only afford a few classes at a time. As a result, the time needed to master new techniques and to create a
commercially viable act ends up being spread over a long period of time. Typically,
this is counterproductive as the creation process is driven by continuous work,
and technical development requires consistent practice. As a result, many new
acts fail to see the light of day because the artist just can't commit the time and
resources to their chosen artistic endeavour while simultaneously supporting
themselves. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>When I began this project, I was amazed by how quickly the various 
costs began to add up. But I've waited long enough to fully realize my dream, so this is the year that I'm biting the bullet and jumping in head first. My pockets may be lighter, but because I've been training with a coach so consistently, I've been able to master difficult skills quickly (in a month or less). And by remaining focused on act development, I've been able to delve much deeper into the creative process, and maintain an environment where artistic growth has been able to flourish.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">What makes me different from other trapezists? Very often, a static trapeze act will showcase flexibility (of which I have little) and poses. As a strong, skilled acrobat, my goal is to transform traditional trapeze into something a
little more explosive. I want to explore how acrobatics performed on the ground
can be transferred to a trapeze, and create a daring act that balances bold, dynamic
tricks with artistic vision. Contemporary circus, being about more than tricks,
combines dance, emotive depth, and being able to project to an audience. All of this is
necessary for a truly exceptional act, which is where my years of performance
experience in both theatre and contemporary circus will be an enormous asset.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>So far I've been funding classes and studio rental on my own. But the equipment I've been working on has been borrowed. If I 
want to find work, and continue training and developing my skills when I go back on tour in the 
fall, I  will need my own trapeze.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p> What happens if I don't reach my goal? I believe Samuel Beckett said it best: ""Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.""</p>
<p><br/>This is already my second attempt at funding. The first was a grant application with the Canada Council for the Arts. While I was told that my project had merit and was highly recommended for funding, my application was unsuccessful due to a lack of available funds...<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>A trapeze to call my very own!<br/><br/>All funds raised that cover the primary goal of $1500 will be used to purchase a trapeze and basic rigging. (carbiners and webbing). I know $1500 seems like a lot, but when you factor in the cost of materials, labour, taxes, and the fact that a trapeze is highly specialized equipment that you can't pick up just anywhere, you can see why the cost is so elevated.<br/><br/>If the fundraising gods smile upon me and I manage to raise more than $1500, that money will also be put to good use! Depending on the amount raised, any extra funds would go toward the following:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>Gaiters (protective shin guards that double as an element of costume) - $270</li>
<li>Having a costume made -  typically between $400 and $450</li>
<li>Portable, Inflatable crash mat (big tricks = big falls) - Price unknown, I'm still researching this.</li>
<li>Additional classes -  $50 per 1 hour class</li>
<li>The development of new promotional material (DVDs, business cards, website, etc.) - this will depend on how much I'm able to do myself.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<br/><h3>What You Get</h3>As you can see to your right, there are all kinds of fun perks. But! The really exciting part is that you will be able to follow me on my journey of transformation into an aerialist! As classes progress and I get further and further into the creation process, I'll post updates on how things are going, and share my insights on being a professional circus artist in the here and now!<br/><br/>Not only that, but in the circus we believe that those in the biz shouldn't have to pay to see shows. I will keep all donors up to date of where I will be preforming and if ever I happen to be someone near you, and you'd like to see a circus show, I will do my very best to get you in free of charge. It doesn't matter if you donate $1 or $1000. In circus, that's just how we roll.<br/><br/>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Spread the word! If this is a project that rings true to you, let your friends and family know about it! If it doesn't really resonate with you but probably would with one of your friends (you know the one), send this their way! I'm a firm believer in the power of one. Be it one voice, one gesture, or one dollar. Thanks for your support!<br/></p>

<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
<h3>A Man lives on a dangerous, desolate beach with his Coconut wife. Existing on the margins of civilization, both Man and Coconut experience excruciating physical and psychological pain. When Coconut rots, the Man is discovered and pulled back to civilization. A faceless office worker named Melissa, attracted to the Man's raw agony, pushes both to the brink of disaster and deliverance.<br/><br/>THE PRODUCTION</h3>
<h3>Rachel Hutt and Jessica Lewis are teaming up with a group of actors and designers to create an ensemble-driven, multi-location site-specific theatre event employing both outdoor and indoor space.

A Man lives on a dangerous, desolate beach with his Coconut wife. Existing on the margins of civilization, both Man and Coconut experience excruciating physical and psychological pain. When Coconut rots, the Man is discovered and pulled back to civilization. A faceless office worker named Melissa, attracted to the Man's raw agony, pushes both to the brink of disaster and deliverance.THE PRODUCTION
Rachel Hutt and Jessica Lewis are teaming up with a group of actors and designers to create an ensemble-driven, multi-location site-specific theatre event employing both outdoor and indoor space. The production will run in New York City for one week in July 2013. As one of the play's themes is finding meaning in objects discarded by society, the set and costumes will be constructed with recycled and abandoned materials.
The play, written at NYU's Dramatic Writing MFA program, has received, a number of staged readings (all with positive feedback) and now deserves the opportunity to become a fully-realized production. Our goal is to raise $3,500 to take the play from the page to the stage. 
WHAT YOUR DONATION WILL DO!
Your contribution will make Man and Coconut a reality. So far, the leadership team has acquired free rehearsal and build space and will utilize resources such as Materials for the Arts to obtain some free production materials. The connections through theatre colleagues and Fractured Atlas have helped during the beginning phases of this project. The production will not launch (be fully produced); however, without your support. 
Money raised from the Man and Coconut Indiegogo campaign will be used as follows: 


Set and costume supplies 


Car rental for load-in and load-out


Park permits


Volunteer accident insurance


Advertising


Stipends for a cast of seven actors and a design/management team of five

<p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>Welcome to the Indiegogo page for <b>Self Indulgent Ballad</b>. Scott here, with a little update on what is happening with the song.</p>
<p><br/><b>Self Indulgent Ballad</b> was born about two years ago, whilst chatting side stage at the Queen’s Theatre (London) with Hadley Fraser. We got on to the subject of musical theatre albums and artistes that released them and we found that on the whole most albums contained all the classic ballads you’d expect and how funny it would be to just be refreshingly honest and call your album ‘Self Indulgent Ballad’...... An idea was born!!</p>
<p><br/>Some years and many re-writes later I find myself here looking to you to help finish what we started. The success of the song lies solely with the fans and supporters who embraced it and it’s important for me to share this final chapter with my friends, family and fans who have supported me so far, so I’ve teamed up with Indiegogo for this exciting project.</p>
<p><br/>Myself and co-composer, Steven Luke Walker, want the song and video to reach a professional level that equally both us and you are proud of. However this is only achievable with your help, so as a thank you we will be releasing the song direct to you guys first, along with tons of exclusives including signed artwork and experiences that we have put together especially for this project.</p>
<p><br/>So how can you support us? Well firstly you can pre-order the song, which will be sent to you as soon as it’s ready (before the official release date!) via a digital download card. If you want a little bit more then you can also get your hands on strictly limited: signed artwork, tickets to the launch event (with the potential for a personal meet &amp; greet), and even the opportunity to hang out in the studio as we record the song, or appear in the music video with array of west end leading performers.</p>
<p><br/>The song has been arranged by the amazing Niall Bailey and we’re recording the song in October at Berry Street Studios with some incredible musicians and vocalists. We aim to film the music video in November and the 'Exclusive Launch Night' will take place some time in December. The song will then become available on itunes and digital download etc after the launch.</p>
<p><br/>Your generous support will ensure we produce a song and video that introduces my writing and comedy to a new audience and I promise to keep you updated every step of the way with exclusive blogs, videos and photos.</p>
<p><br/>I hope you'll love the finished song as much as I have loved writing it, don’t forget to pre-order the song, get hold of some launch tickets and maybe purchase one of the other perks on offer!</p>
<p><br/>Most of all please, please, please… spread the word!</p>
<p><br/>Love and best wishes,</p>

Η Ομάδα Θεάτρου Seveneleven είναι μία Αστική Μη Κερδοσκοπική Εταιρεία που ιδρύθηκε το 2013 από τους ηθοποιούς Νότη Παρασκευόπουλο και Κωνσταντίνα Μαλτέζου με σκοπό την παραγωγή θεατρικών παραστάσεων. Έως τώρα, η ομάδα μας έχει κάνει δύο παραγωγές και χρειαζόμαστε τη δική σας βοήθεια για την επόμενη. 

Ακόμη και 1€ μας βοηθάει πολύ, καθώς δεν υπάρχουν άλλοι οικονομικοί πόροι στήριξης της τρέχουσας παραγωγής. Αν και το κόστος παραγωγής έχει κρατηθεί σε πολύ χαμηλό επίπεδο, φροντίζουμε πάντοτε να προσφέρουμε ένα υψηλής ποιότητας και αισθητικής αποτέλεσμα στους θεατές μας. Έτσι, λοιπόν, συνεισφέροντας στην καμπάνια μας, βοηθάτε την ομάδα μας να συνεχίσει και να χτίσει ένα πιο ισχυρό κοινό.

Τι χρειαζόμαστε και τι προσφέρουμε

Τα χρήματα που θα μαζευτούν θα χρησιμοποιηθούν για να καλύψουν τα έξοδα της παραγωγής, όπως το ενοίκιο του θεάτρου, κοστούμια και σκηνικά αντικείμενα.


Για κάθε ποσό που μας προσφέρετε, υπάρχει το αντίστοιχο αντάλλαγμα που σκοπό έχει να σας φέρει σε επαφή με την ομάδα θεάτρου μας και τις παραγωγές της.


Σε περίπτωση που δεν φτάσουμε τον επιθυμητό στόχο, θα χρησιμοποιήσουμε το ποσό που έχει συλλεχθεί για την κάλυψη όσο το δυνατόν μεγαλύτερου μέρους της παραγωγής.

Εναλλακτικοί τρόποι στήριξηςΓια όλους εσάς που θέλετε μα δεν μπορείτε να συνεισφέρετε οικονομικά, υπάρχουν κι άλλοι τρόποι για να στηρίξετε την προσπάθειά και την ομάδα μας:

Δημοσιεύστε (share) την καμπάνια μας στο προφίλ σας στο facebook ή οπουδήποτε εσείς πιστεύετε πως μπορεί να μας βοηθήσει.

<h3>What is <i>Liliom</i>?<br/>
</h3>A love story that has transfixed audiences for nearly a century, <em>Liliom</em> inspired the legendary musical <em>Carousel</em>. The story of a servant-girl and the rough and gruff carousel barker she weds, <em>Liliom</em> is an extraordinary work about the limits of love and the prices we pay for it.<br/><br/>For
 the first time in over 40 years, Molnar's play returns to New York City

<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>We need to raise funds to cover the costs of producing such a legendary play. The turn-of-the-century costumes alone will cost a pretty penny, and we'll need to rent many items from costume warehouses. In addition, the props to create the world of Muskat's Carousel will be a daunting cast. But what we'll produce is a memorable production of a beautiful play that has inspired and touched audiences for nearly 100 years. <br/><br/>Be sure to check out the perks on the right side of your screen. We've got lots of exciting offers to say ""thanks"" for your support!<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>Nowadays, Rodgers and Hammerstein's <i>Carousel</i> is produced nearly 10x as often as Molnar's <i>Liliom. </i>While the two entities are much more different than you'd imagine, Hammerstein found great success in adapting such a dark and painful piece of theatre for the musical stage. With your help, we can remind audiences of the play that inspired one of Broadway's most important musicals. <br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Can't donate? We understand. We get tons of requests to help with other campaigns and we often just can't give to everyone that we want to! But there are other things you can do to help us:<br/><br/>-spread the word about our campaign on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and more<br/>-e-mail friends and family who <i>can</i> donate and encourage them to support our project<br/>-buy tickets to the production when they are placed on sale<br/></span></span></span></div>","What is Liliom?

For 17 years we have trained close to a thousand young people in different forms of dance whether it be ballet, hip hop, jazz, tap, contemporary or musical theatre, and have recently expanded by offering voice, music and acting lessons. Competitively, PraiseTEAM has won over 100 local and international awards, including podium finishes at Hip Hop International in Las Vegas.
We give our time and talent for worthy causes, and we involve ourselves in a number of outreach programs, charitable works, services in the parish, and local and international events. These include can drives, fundraising events, performing at local events and youth conferences, and raising funds to build the PraiseTEAM Learning Centre for underprivileged children in Nueva Ecija, Philippines. We ensure that our students get involved in good works and service.
We are part of the Youth Minstry of the Salesians of Don Bosco in the Our Lady of Good Counsel Church. The Salesians have supported our arts ministry in every way they can, particularly by making the space available for
us to work in and nourishing us through their spiritual guidance. We are truly grateful for their generosity through the years, but we believe it is time for us to make room in the space which we were graciously given in order for us to keep growing and to continue our mission, and to allow a new family to be born into our community at Don Bosco Youth Center!


A Safe Place of Expression - For our students to share their talents and spread positive messages through the performing arts. We strive to make a difference in the lives of our performers by ministering to them and honing their skills, talents and passion for the arts. We welcome everyone and have granted scholarships to those who are strongly talented and to those with financial concerns. Many of our students now work professionally and have become PraiseTEAM teachers themselves!

Year End Productions - To showcase the hard work and dedication of our performers. We rehearse together as a company, inspiring each other and strengthening our bond as a family. At the same time, part of the proceeds is and will continue to be donated to help build homes in 3rd world countries, particularly through Gawad Kalinga and ANCOP International, and used for grant scholarships and bursaries to deserving and financially struggling students.

Competitions - To help students develop self confidence, discipline, perseverance to teach them the value of hard work and striving to be the best you can be.

Community - To get our students involved in the community, either indirectly through workshops, fundraisers, and can drives, or directly, such as through involvement in the Agape ministry serving food, singing Christmas carols to the homeless, or performing at various community events.



Don Bosco is a Youth Centre with many events; often we have to relocate and find another venue to rehearse at.
Sometimes, it results to rehearsing outside!
We have mirrors on wheels that we roll out of a small office. In transport, they break. Often.
Sometimes there are 3 to 4 classes going on at the same time with no walls to cover the sounds of each class, making it very hard for the students to hear their instructor and focus on their lesson.
Speakers are broken due to teachers maximizing the volume in order for their class to hear the music above the other classes'.
We need a place to focus on our mission and our passion.
 We have been focusing on finding others a
home and now it is time for us to have a home of our own to accommodate our rapidly growing community!
    



Space - A space to call our own, with separate rooms for different classes, an office space for our admin, and even a music room! Oh, and a schedule that won't be interrupted by various events so that we never have to practice outside again.

<h3><b style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"">ABOUT PLAYS &amp; PLAYERS</b></h3></b><p>We are a 102 year old theater company that owns and operates a 102 year 
old theater nestled in a residential block just off of Rittenhouse 
Square, one of the oldest continually operated theaters in the United 
States. You can see why we are particularly unique in the title: ""Plays 
&amp; Players."" We are not just about the plays we put on, but about the
 community of artists and generations of families that have come through
 this building. Even Kevin Bacon performed here as a child!<br/><br/><b>ABOUT P.L.A.Y.</b><br/></p><p>Plays &amp; Players has produced a full season of plays every 
year since our inception, but currently only offer plays for adults. 
It's time to change that.<br/><br/>
Philadelphia Local Artists for Youth (P.L.A.Y.) is a brand new yearly 
series aimed at introducing young audiences to the power of live 
theater. And it's all local: a local playwright telling local stories 
utilizing local actors, directors, and designers. Each play is developed
 and workshopped throughout the summer at the theater. The inaugural 
work will be titled <i>Delaware Mudtub &amp; The Mighty Wampum</i>, running <span>March 13-30</span>,
 and will explore mythic animals local to the area (The Great Blue 
Heron, The Red Fox, The Box Turtle), people once indigenous to the 
Delaware River (The Lenni-Lenape), and the rituals and journeys that 
speak across time and species.<br/><br/>
The P.L.A.Y. program was conceived by Producing Artistic Director Daniel
 Student, who trained on children's theater produced in Europe and 
Australia. With his leadership, in collaboration with director Candace 
Cihocki and writer Greg Romero, Delaware Mudtub uses physical theater techniques, found object 
puppetry and instrumentation, and even acro-yoga as a basis for the 
production. At its core, P.L.A.Y. seeks to respect the artistic judgment
 and aesthetic of a young person, and invites them to participate in the
 magic of the theatrical experience. It is an interactive and alive 
performance.<br/><br/>
The cast of emerging professionals ready to burst onto the Philadelphia 
scene include recent graduates of the University of the Arts, Erin 
Elizabeth Carney, Andrew Carroll, and Mary Beth Schrader, Temple 
University grads Heather Cole and Maria Konstantinidis, and Rowan 
University graduate Tyler Garamella. Inspiring local designers involved include puppet designer Leila Ghaznavi, set designer Colin McIlvaine, props designer Ben Storey, light designer Andrew Cowles, dramaturg Laurel Hostek, and assistant director Eric Wunsch.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>We need $7102 (we are 102 years old... get it?) But no matter what we raise from you, we vow to produce this show with as much integrity and artistic quality as we can muster. We owe our audience that much.<br/></p><p>The funds will go directly to the costs of the first production which 
indirectly allows us to keep our ticket costs low (as little as $10) and
 even offer free tickets. This allows underserved communities a chance 
to see the performance, and creates community alliances for the theater 
to seek further funding from private and public funding sources. In other words, funding us in a small way now means we can put on the kind of quality work that reaches important audiences that will propel us towards long term success with just a little push from you!</p><p><b>A donation of $502</b> makes you an independent sponsor for the production! <br/></p><ul>

""Brothers Beckett"" gives a voice to many people you may know (you might even be one of them!). It gives a glimpse into the lives of everyone who has struggled to grow up as they age, to everyone who has striven to balance family, love, friendship, and responsibility. We're all a little absurd as we hold onto the way things were and a little confused as we try to shape the life we want.

<p>     It was just another balmy afternoon in
Savannah, Georgia, when I laid eyes on her for the first time. She was leaning
against the bike rack, nonchalant, stray sunlight gleaming through the grime
she wore proudly. Dented, scratched, and weathered as she was, she was still a
beautiful contraption; she had style, two wheels, a motor and… pedals? </p>
<p>     This moped, the
name for a vintage motorized vehicle charmingly equipped with pedals, was my
introduction to the world of cheap, temperamental transport.  For a kid starting college in a small city
and a job at a pizza joint, the compact size and minimal expense to maintain,
upgrade, and fuel made mopeds a good investment, and as I would learn, a
growing obsession. From college freshman to college graduate, Savannah to
Atlanta, not knowing what a carburetor was to getting an engine designed for
35mph to go 70, getting hit by cars to hitching rides in trucks, going to
rallies as far away from Atlanta GA as New York City and Denver and meeting
people from all over the country, the culture of the moped community has continued
to occupy my life and fascinate me, leading me to the point of this
introduction, and  with your help, my
greatest moped test and adventure so far…. The Pinball Run.</p>
<br/><p><b>The Pinball Run:</b></p><p></p><p>     Established in 2013, The Pinball Run: 2 Strokes to
Paradise, Portland, ME to Key West, set a precedent of wonder and test of skill
within the moped community worldwide.  The
Pinball Run is a race, in which teams of moped riders from all over the country
seek to push their mopeds, as well as themselves, to the limit, all the while
making connections with fellow riders and others along the way across the
country.  </p>     Hard Times to the Big Easy, The Pinball Run 2:
The Adventures of Tomos Sawyer, is a 1400 mile, 5 day, moped race beginning on
September 1<sup>st</sup>, 2014 from Minneapolis MN to New Orleans LA along the
Mississippi river. Starting at the origin of the United States’ greatest river
in Minneapolis, down through the flowing fields of the country’s heartland in
Cedar Rapids, IA, St Louis, MO, Memphis, TN, on into the deep south of Jackson,
MS, and finishing in the soaked delta plains of New Orleans, LA this year’s
race is my first opportunity to participate in such an event.  After being unable to partake in the first
race as I was finishing up my undergraduate in Printmaking, I am hoping to see
parts of the country I have never experienced, accompanied by team members, and
the gurus that introduced me to mopeds, Pat Norris and Tim Ostrum. Also joining
our team are my good friends from Sumpter, SC, Charles Maynard, founder/
president of the Buzzards Moped Club, and co-founder/ secretary, Tommy Barwick.<br/><p></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Mopeds?</b></p><p></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p><p>     Now you may still be wondering what constitutes a
moped exactly. A moped is a class of motorized vehicle typically defined by
the law as a two-wheeled vehicle powered by a single speed or automatic if
multi-speed, motor up to, but not exceeding, 49 cubic centimeters in cylinder
volume or displacement, with a top speed of 35 mph. these restrictions have
allowed for minimal operational requirements, which vary from state to state
but general only require a DOT helmet, working head light and tail light, and a
valid learners permit. No plates, no registration, and no insurance.  Though the moped has mostly died out
production wise after the late 80s to make way for the modern scooter, the DYI
mentality, ease of modification, low cost, easy maintenance, fuel economy and
minimal licensing requirements has given rise to a new cultural movement and
community of young and old builders/riders/clubs that gather to rally throughout
the year all over the nation with each group hosting an event in their major
cities.  This community has engulfed me
in a vast network of others seeking fun, alternative modes of transportation. </p><p><br/></p><p><b>Here's where you come in:</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><b>     In order to complete such a quest, a bold
moped-er would need firstly, a moped, secondly, plenty of backup parts for motors, brake cables, tires,
inner tubes, pistons, cylinders, clutches, and tools to fix these things. I will also need money for cheap accommodations along the way, food, and gas not only
for the moped but for the chase vehicle, too.</b></p><b>
</b><p>Expenses list:</p>
<p>Chase vehicle/gas: $800</p>
<p>Moped gas for the ride: $100</p>
<p>Food for the week: $100</p>
<p>Moped build: $1,672</p>
<p>Portra 400 camera film roll of 20: $40</p><p><br/><span></span></p><p style=""display: inline !important;""></p><p style=""display: inline !important;""><b></b></p><p></p><p style=""display: inline !important;""></p><p><b style=""background-color: initial;""></b></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><table><tbody>

could break down, be hit by a car, wreck, become butt hurt (see: ass chafing),
I could lose a finger, I could lose an eye! </p>
<p>What qualifies me to overcome/ avoid these hurdles is:</p>
<p>-Spare parts, back up motors and the build. That’s why I’m asking for your help.</p>
<p>-I have chosen a motor that I could easily rebuild in my sleep.
Or eyes closed, hands tied, hanging upside down. It’s simple, reliable, stock
(less likely to blow up). I will also be carrying a range of basic tools and
smaller minor spare parts on my moped as I ride. Specialized tools and larger
parts that can be used in the event of misfortune, such as a welder or spare
motors, will be carried by the chase vehicle that will follow the team as we
ride into the sunset.</p>

With your help, I will be attempting to ride a pedal-start, vintage 2-stroke Puch Maxi in a 1400 mile, 5 day race.   A love story:
     It was just another balmy afternoon in
Savannah, Georgia, when I laid eyes on her for the first time. She was leaning
against the bike rack, nonchalant, stray sunlight gleaming through the grime
she wore proudly. Dented, scratched, and weathered as she was, she was still a
beautiful contraption; she had style, two wheels, a motor and… pedals? 
     This moped, the
name for a vintage motorized vehicle charmingly equipped with pedals, was my
introduction to the world of cheap, temperamental transport.  For a kid starting college in a small city
and a job at a pizza joint, the compact size and minimal expense to maintain,
upgrade, and fuel made mopeds a good investment, and as I would learn, a
growing obsession. From college freshman to college graduate, Savannah to
Atlanta, not knowing what a carburetor was to getting an engine designed for
35mph to go 70, getting hit by cars to hitching rides in trucks, going to
rallies as far away from Atlanta GA as New York City and Denver and meeting
people from all over the country, the culture of the moped community has continued
to occupy my life and fascinate me, leading me to the point of this
introduction, and  with your help, my
greatest moped test and adventure so far…. The Pinball Run.
The Pinball Run:     Established in 2013, The Pinball Run: 2 Strokes to
Paradise, Portland, ME to Key West, set a precedent of wonder and test of skill
within the moped community worldwide.  The
Pinball Run is a race, in which teams of moped riders from all over the country
seek to push their mopeds, as well as themselves, to the limit, all the while
making connections with fellow riders and others along the way across the
country.       Hard Times to the Big Easy, The Pinball Run 2:
The Adventures of Tomos Sawyer, is a 1400 mile, 5 day, moped race beginning on
September 1st, 2014 from Minneapolis MN to New Orleans LA along the
Mississippi river. Starting at the origin of the United States’ greatest river
in Minneapolis, down through the flowing fields of the country’s heartland in
Cedar Rapids, IA, St Louis, MO, Memphis, TN, on into the deep south of Jackson,
MS, and finishing in the soaked delta plains of New Orleans, LA this year’s
race is my first opportunity to participate in such an event.  After being unable to partake in the first
race as I was finishing up my undergraduate in Printmaking, I am hoping to see
parts of the country I have never experienced, accompanied by team members, and
the gurus that introduced me to mopeds, Pat Norris and Tim Ostrum. Also joining
our team are my good friends from Sumpter, SC, Charles Maynard, founder/
president of the Buzzards Moped Club, and co-founder/ secretary, Tommy Barwick.Mopeds?     Now you may still be wondering what constitutes a
moped exactly. A moped is a class of motorized vehicle typically defined by
the law as a two-wheeled vehicle powered by a single speed or automatic if
multi-speed, motor up to, but not exceeding, 49 cubic centimeters in cylinder
volume or displacement, with a top speed of 35 mph. these restrictions have
allowed for minimal operational requirements, which vary from state to state
but general only require a DOT helmet, working head light and tail light, and a
valid learners permit. No plates, no registration, and no insurance.  Though the moped has mostly died out
production wise after the late 80s to make way for the modern scooter, the DYI
mentality, ease of modification, low cost, easy maintenance, fuel economy and
minimal licensing requirements has given rise to a new cultural movement and
community of young and old builders/riders/clubs that gather to rally throughout
the year all over the nation with each group hosting an event in their major
cities.  This community has engulfed me
in a vast network of others seeking fun, alternative modes of transportation. Here's where you come in:     In order to complete such a quest, a bold
moped-er would need firstly, a moped, secondly, plenty of backup parts for motors, brake cables, tires,
inner tubes, pistons, cylinders, clutches, and tools to fix these things. I will also need money for cheap accommodations along the way, food, and gas not only
for the moped but for the chase vehicle, too.
Expenses list:
Chase vehicle/gas: $800
Moped gas for the ride: $100
Food for the week: $100
Moped build: $1,672

Challenges:     Yes, there will be challenges on this epic 1400 mile trip. I
could break down, be hit by a car, wreck, become butt hurt (see: ass chafing),
I could lose a finger, I could lose an eye! 
What qualifies me to overcome/ avoid these hurdles is:
-Spare parts, back up motors and the build. That’s why I’m asking for your help.
-I have chosen a motor that I could easily rebuild in my sleep.
Or eyes closed, hands tied, hanging upside down. It’s simple, reliable, stock
(less likely to blow up). I will also be carrying a range of basic tools and
smaller minor spare parts on my moped as I ride. Specialized tools and larger
parts that can be used in the event of misfortune, such as a welder or spare
motors, will be carried by the chase vehicle that will follow the team as we
ride into the sunset.
-Oh yeah, 6 years of daily riding and 4 rally seasons.Rally history:Swoop Jockeys, Atlanta, GA  2011

Bangert, and I'm a professional juggler, originally from Donnellson, 
Iowa, in the USA. I've been juggling for almost nine years, starting at 
the age of 19 around when I began attending the University of Iowa. For 
some years I was part of a circus group based out of Iowa City (Cirque 
Stupendo) which fostered my interest and growth in the arts and 
challenges of circus, performing the likes of juggling, unicycling, 
acrobatics, musical saw, sitar, whips, equilibrism, firebreathing, sword
 swallowing, and more. After some time I decided to scale back and focus
 on what always interested me most - juggling, particularly ball 
juggling, which I've been delving into more and more particularly the 
last three years.</p><p>For a long time my goal with the love of 
juggling was more or less to become 'amazing,' in the traditional circus
 sense - the primary focus being masterful tricks that surprise and awe 
people, and entertain in their difficulty. This method of performing is 
quite a beautiful thing and I've found it to be an inspiring, sacred, 
and rewarding phenomenon, However, once I attained a certain level of 
proficiency with 'pure,' 'amazing,' juggling, I reached a philosophical 
zone I imagine all artists intrude upon, after the honeymooned time with
 a particular skill, where I started to question the meaning of my 
performances, and then, how to change that meaning. The answer has come 
to me in the form of movement studies and dance.</p><p>My style of 
juggling as it has developed has seemed like a peculiar form of dance to
 me for some time, and I've been continuing that approach. In my semi - 
improvisational style, I think of juggling as a way of creating 
'problems' or 'situations' in the air and solving these with the 
movement of the body, creating a compelling canvas of the relationship of objects
 to the body and the surrounding environment. In much the same way, I 
consider juggling to be a martial art - an activity that can be continually drawn upon to expand your awareness of a personal kinesphere 
and the possibilities within it. <br/></p><p>And so, I've become interested in dance as a way to explore the possibilities of expression within these fields and add depth to the way I perform, and to push the edges of juggling in new ways.

<p>Joe loves apple pie, Rush Limbaugh, the fourth of July and his wife Jane. He is blue-collar, corn-fed, made in the USA and proud, but when his uninsured wife is diagnosed with cancer his patriotic feelings and passion for the ethos of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness are turned upside down. <em>In Mercy Killers, a new one-man play, Joe struggles with the uniquely American experience of losing your health in the land of plenty.</em></p>
<p><strong>About The Author</strong></p>
<p>My name is Michael Milligan, author and performer of Mercy Killers. I have been a professional actor since graduating from Julliard in 2001 (where I received the John Houseman Prize!) I’ve performed on Broadway in August: Osage County and La Bete as well as many other productions Off- Broadway and Off-Off Broadway. My real bread and butter has been performing in many of our nation’s incredible regional theaters and Shakespeare festivals like the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis and the Shakespeare Theater in D.C.</p>
<p><strong>Statement of Purpose- Health Care as a Human Right</strong></p>
<p>Last Spring I was uninsured for the first time in my adult life. About three weeks into being uninsured I experienced excruciating pain while doing a reading of a new play. I had to excuse myself and hobble back to the basement I was staying at in Jersey City. It was a horrible night of nausea, urinating blood (sorry for the gory details!), and unending pain. Worst of all, I didn’t know what was happening. In between the waves of pain, I was at the computer trying to diagnose myself online and googling things like ‘how much will it cost to pay for an ambulance and emergency room.’ Worst of all, I spent the evening performing a gruesome kind of accounting. ‘Let’s see, if I’m experiencing kidney failure, I have an 8% chance of being dead in the morning. However, a trip in the ambulance to the emergency room will cost me $8000, which I can’t really afford. I guess I’ll take my chances and see how I feel in the morning.’</p>
<p>Thankfully, it turned out that I had passed kidney stones- which although seriously painful is not a serious condition. However, the experience made me wonder what it must be like to face a serious health emergency in America without insurance. Kidney stones is one thing, but what about cancer? The experience led to a lot research, interviews, and soul searching.</p>
<p>Mercy Killers is a play about what it can be like for working people to face a major health crisis in America. I gave a number of benefit performances of it in Minnesota in collaboration with Health Care for All Minnesota. Here’s what state senator, John Marty had to say about it:</p>
<p><strong><em>‘</em></strong><em>Michael Milligan's ""Mercy Killers"" is a powerful play that illustrates the urgency of replacing our dysfunctional health insurance system.  In this painfully accurate portrayal of the personal struggles of one couple, Milligan makes public the suffering that thousands of American families experience in private.   I was inspired by the performance, and energized to move our state from health insurance for some, to health care for all.</em><strong><em>’</em></strong><em> </em><strong>John Marty, State Senator, MN.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tour</strong></p>
<p>I am putting together a ‘micro-tour’ of Mercy Killers in collaboration with local health care advocacy groups to raise awareness about our dysfunctional health care system. I have reserved a theater in Columbus, Ohio (the swingin’ city of the swing state) for a 3 week run in Feb/March. While in Ohio I will be traveling to towns like Toledo, Akron, Dayton, Medina, and Oberlin to share the story and help generate support for local single-payer advocacy groups. After the Ohio trip, I’ll be heading off to Minnesota and New York to work with advocacy groups and progressive organizations to share Mercy Killers in both big cities and smaller communities around the states to help raise awareness about legislation to create single payer systems at the state level.</p>
<p><strong>Your contribution</strong></p>
<p>Unless I am doing a benefit for a specific organization,<em> performances of Mercy Killers will be free and open to the public</em> (with an invitation to make a donation at the end of the show to help keep the tour going!) <em><strong>Your contribution will help generate an audience of people who normally would not attend the theater.</strong></em> It will help pay for transportation, marketing, a small artist’s fee and in some cases, the rental fee for venues.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Response</strong></p>
<p>I believe Mercy Killers is a powerful story and tool for raising awareness about our health care system. But don’t just take my word for it! <strong>Here’s what some of the folks I’ve worked with have to say:</strong></p>
<p><em>“Michael Milligan’s Mercy Killers is a powerful teaching tool to deliver the emotional impact of how our health care system chews up and spits out so many Americans. This masterfully written and performed play displays the agonizing, dehumanizing suffering needlessly imposed on decent people by a system that turns health care into a commodity instead of a basic human right. Mercy Killers poignantly demonstrated how rugged individualism can’t compete with diseases and expenses that can strike down anyone.”</em> –Buddy Robinson, Co-Coordinator, Greater Minnesota Health Care Coalition.</p>
<p><em>‘As a long-time advocate for meaningful healthcare reform, I found a refreshing perspective in ‘Mercy Killers’.  When focusing on policy, it can be easy to lose sight of the actual plight faced by real people.  The play provides a very personal look at the blameless catastrophe many average Americans face when they become ill.  As a doctor, I have amassed plenty of my own horror stories of patient suffering.  I was surprised I could be this affected by yet another.  However, Milligan’s acting is superb, and I was completely engrossed in the story from beginning to end.  The tale he weaves brings you into the middle of a needless, mind-numbing tragedy that should never happen in a country as wealthy as ours.  It has power that facts and figures will never offer.  Regardless of political persuasion or beliefs about how to fix the healthcare mess, audience members will leave the performance deeply moved and in agreement that we simply cannot leave things as they are.’ - </em>Ann Settgast, MD, Co-chair, Minnesota chapter of Physicians for a National Healthcare Program</p>
<p><em>“Mercy Killers is an extremely powerful and heart-wrenching testament to our health care system’s effects on our finances, families, and overall well-being.”</em> Erin Anderson, Executive Director, Health Care for All Minnesota.</p>
<p><em>“Michael Milligan's breath-taking performance of a shattered man in the throes of a healthcare nightmare, made only worse by the twists and turns of insurance companies, truly humanizes the vast inequities of America's for profit health insurance system. You will be talking about 'Mercy Killers' long after the curtain draws.""</em> - Josh Starcher, Healthcare-NOW! NYC</p>
<p>“<em>A deeply affecting love story, Mike Milligan astonishes.”</em> Connie Julian, Revolution Books.</p>

While in Ohio I will be traveling to towns like Toledo, Akron, Dayton, Medina, and Oberlin to share the story and help generate support for local single-payer advocacy groups. After the Ohio trip, I’ll be heading off to Minnesota and New York to work with advocacy groups and progressive organizations to share Mercy Killers in both big cities and smaller communities around the states to help raise awareness about legislation to create single payer systems at the state level.
Your contribution
Unless I am doing a benefit for a specific organization, performances of Mercy Killers will be free and open to the public (with an invitation to make a donation at the end of the show to help keep the tour going!) Your contribution will help generate an audience of people who normally would not attend the theater. It will help pay for transportation, marketing, a small artist’s fee and in some cases, the rental fee for venues.
Critical Response
I believe Mercy Killers is a powerful story and tool for raising awareness about our health care system. But don’t just take my word for it! Here’s what some of the folks I’ve worked with have to say:
“Michael Milligan’s Mercy Killers is a powerful teaching tool to deliver the emotional impact of how our health care system chews up and spits out so many Americans. This masterfully written and performed play displays the agonizing, dehumanizing suffering needlessly imposed on decent people by a system that turns health care into a commodity instead of a basic human right. Mercy Killers poignantly demonstrated how rugged individualism can’t compete with diseases and expenses that can strike down anyone.” –Buddy Robinson, Co-Coordinator, Greater Minnesota Health Care Coalition.
‘As a long-time advocate for meaningful healthcare reform, I found a refreshing perspective in ‘Mercy Killers’.  When focusing on policy, it can be easy to lose sight of the actual plight faced by real people.  The play provides a very personal look at the blameless catastrophe many average Americans face when they become ill.  As a doctor, I have amassed plenty of my own horror stories of patient suffering.  I was surprised I could be this affected by yet another.  However, Milligan’s acting is superb, and I was completely engrossed in the story from beginning to end.  The tale he weaves brings you into the middle of a needless, mind-numbing tragedy that should never happen in a country as wealthy as ours.  It has power that facts and figures will never offer.  Regardless of political persuasion or beliefs about how to fix the healthcare mess, audience members will leave the performance deeply moved and in agreement that we simply cannot leave things as they are.’ - Ann Settgast, MD, Co-chair, Minnesota chapter of Physicians for a National Healthcare Program
“Mercy Killers is an extremely powerful and heart-wrenching testament to our health care system’s effects on our finances, families, and overall well-being.” Erin Anderson, Executive Director, Health Care for All Minnesota.
“Michael Milligan's breath-taking performance of a shattered man in the throes of a healthcare nightmare, made only worse by the twists and turns of insurance companies, truly humanizes the vast inequities of America's for profit health insurance system. You will be talking about 'Mercy Killers' long after the curtain draws."" - Josh Starcher, Healthcare-NOW! NYC
“A deeply affecting love story, Mike Milligan astonishes.” Connie Julian, Revolution Books.

The short
version: The Solutions
Grassroots Tour is a series of theater, film and concert events that give communities the tools and resources to build their own renewable energy.
The long
version: The Solutions
Grassroots Tour is much more than a one-night play or screening. It is a
series of culture events and campaigns that will galvanize the renewable energy
revolution at the grassroots level across the United States.Conceived and directed by Oscar-Nominated and Emmy-Winning filmmaker and activist Josh Fox, The Solutions Grassroots Tour combines classic storytelling with roll-up-your sleeves organizing to look at the impacts of fossil fuel development and provide a vision for developing renewable energy like no other event on the planet. Why Renewable Energy? The debate is over and the science is in, CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL, and our current energy infrastructure is what's causing it. If we continue to burn fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas to run our country, soon we won't have a planet we can live on.The Solutions
