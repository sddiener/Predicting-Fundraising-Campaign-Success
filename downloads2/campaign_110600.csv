<p>Hi, I am Chika Efobi, a qualified project
manager with a Masters degree in Information Systems Management from De
Montfort University Leicester, United Kingdom.  In my spare
time, I enjoy having conversations with a diverse group of individuals. It has
always been my belief that everybody has something to teach you, if you are
willing to listen and learn.</p>
<p>I have always dreamt of writing my novel
but for many days which eventually turned to many months, I sat on the
sofa and found solace in watching TV shows as against opening my laptop to start writing my book. </p>
<p>I knew I had to start one day but with every evening that came by, I convinced myself that I would start the following day.  Come the following day, I did the exact same
thing and before anyone could say “Jack Robinson”, 8 long years had flown by. </p>
<p>At the start of this year, I came to the realisation that if I did not start this novel, it
would continue to remain only an aspiration.</p>
<p>The beautiful thing is that once I began writing
the book, once I picked up my laptop and started to write, the words could not
stop flowing. I found myself writing on the train during my commute to work, at
the railway station and on the odd days, when the battery of my mobile devices ran
out, I brought out my notebook from my handbag and carried on writing. </p>
<p>Fast forward 6 months, I have now finished the
manuscript and sent to my editor.</p>

<h3>Volume One: Decades in the Making</h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I've been cooking professionally, on and off, for more than three decades. I've worked at every level in the industry, in countless positions. During that time, I have filled notebooks and index cards with recipes, ideas, and inspirations on dishes that range from traditional to modern. I've taught cooking to adults and to children as young as seven. And it's in teaching where I've found my real passion. This book is the culmination of those years of experience. And it's only the beginning.</span></p>
<p>This isn't another, ""isn't that pretty"" coffee table cookbooks, with artistically-styled photos that you can never hope to recreate in your home kitchen. This is your notes-in-the-margin, grease-stained, well-worn cookbook that is always within reach when you're in the kitchen. It's your spell book for kitchen magic. You will learn how to work in your kitchen like a chef, and how to go off-recipe and add your own personal touch to each dish and make it your own. I believe that once you understand cooking fundamentals, you're only limited by your imagination.</p>
<p>This cookbook, whether it's in the hands of an experienced cook or a child, will elevate your kitchen craft to the next level.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>
<p>The recipes have already been written. This campaign is to raise funds for typesetting and layout, printing the first run, advertising, fees, and research for... Volume 2. I'm setting the initial campaign to $9000 to cover all of it, which is about on par with what other cookbook campaigns are asking.</p>
<p>Perks will include signed copies, recipe dedications, and even on-site private meals for you and your guests. I'll even do product placement if you manufacture (kosher) food items I can use for ingredients.</p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal 100%, everyone who contributes will still get a cookbook! It might not be hardcover bound, but this cookbook is happening!</p>
<h3>Why Invest in <i>This</i> Cookbook?</h3>
<p>People who cook by rote truly miss out on the pleasure of creating delicious food. My cookbook will demonstrate, teach, and encourage you on how to go beyond what is printed and put your twist on a recipe to make it your own. You'll learn how to substitute ingredients, either because you don't have something, or you're tired of the same old recipe.</p>
<p>This is not the first cookbook I've written, either. I have three other cookbooks that I've written as curriculum for cooking classes, and I have contributed to other cookbooks.</p>
<p>The recipes I present in my cookbook have all been extensively tested by me, and by my faithful recipe testers.</p>

<h3><strong>Who am I?</strong></h3>
<p>I am Heidi Bartle, married to Garry for 20 wonderful years. We are parents to five terrific children. I suffered with depression for years before receiving a bipolar diagnosis in 2012. While I do have occasional manic episodes, depression is still my primary bipolar feature, and doctors have struggled to adequately treat it.  I wrote <i>When Mommy Feels Sad  </i>to be a vehicle for talking with my children about my depression. Therapists spurred me to publish the book, as it is badly needed in children's literature. I want to help other parents and children who suffer with the silent stigma of mental illness.</p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Self-publishing is expensive! I aim to raise $3000 to help with production costs like paying the illustrator, buying the ISBN and publisher logo, and printing and shipping the first 150 books. Money that exceeds production costs will be saved for future print runs or production of the second book in the series, <i>Feeling Manic and Other Things: An Exploration in Bipolar Disorder</i>!</p>
<p>You can feel confident that the book will be published. Here are some of the benchmarks:</p>
<p>First draft of the manuscript: October 8, 2017<br/>Buying the publishing rights and ISBN with Aviva: October 12, 2017<br/>Hiring the illustrator: October 30, 2017<br/>Hiring the editor: November 20, 2017<br/>Contracting with the printer: February 12, 2018<br/>Receiving final illustrations and book layout: March 5, 2018</p>
<p>Your contributions will earn some fun prizes, including a bookmark with an image and quote from the book, an e-book, a signed hardcover copy, and an opportunity to talk with me, either alone or with your book group, about my journey through depression. While I certainly do not claim to be an expert on mental illness or public speaking, I have discovered that people, whether they are experiencing mental illness or trying to care for someone who does, find value in speaking with someone ""in the trenches."" I'm happy to try to help. </p>
<p>All incentives aside,  you can feel good about your money promoting mental health awareness during a time when people are stepping out of the shadows with a desire to be heard. You can say you helped start a crucial conversation. PRE-ORDER TODAY!</p>

<p><strong>Good books are rare.<br/>Even more rare are good books for small money.</strong></p>
<p>Edition assemblage always manages to find the good stuff and spread it for an affordable price but unfortunately their admirable dedication is not enough to cover all the financial costs of publishing.</p>
<p>This book is done, out and available as of now, but there are still some expences of the publishing process to cover. This is the reason for this crowdfunding with all its amazing perks by Yori Gagarim, most of them handmade.<br/><br/>///</p>
<p><strong>Gute Bücher sind selten.<br/>Noch seltener sind gute Bücher zum kleinen Preis.</strong></p>
<p>Die edition assemblage schafft es immer wieder kleine literarische Schätze aufzutreiben und zu erschwinglichen Preisen unter die Leute zu bringen.<br/>Das alles funktioniert mit viel Idealismus aber leider nicht ohne finanzielle Mittel.</p>
<p>Dieses Buch ist zwar fertig und ab sofort erhältlich, allerding sind leider noch nicht alle Kosten gedeckt. Deswegen gibt es dieses Crowdfunding mit vielen wunderbaren Perks von Yori Gagarim, die meisten davon handgemacht.</p>
<h2>
<br/>The Book /// Das Buch</h2>
<p><br/><strong>""Why I Stopped Making Merch for a Revolution That Does not Happen.""</strong><br/><strong>is a bitter love story/essay about survival as an artist in activist communities.</strong><br/><br/>Written down within a couple of days, this inner monologue captures more than two decades of precious experiences and harsh disappointments, and connects growing up in a DIY-family to marketable skills in recent subcultures and neoliberalism.<br/>It is a very personal approach on how to make a living as a self-taught DIY artist while doing professional work in alternative communities, and how (self)exploitation led to disillusionment. The story starts with the leftovers of punk in the 1980s, glances at the beginnings of street art, anarchist, and queer subcultures in Berlin, and comes to an end in 2016 when frustration, boredom, and abuse led to this difficult decision: stepping back from something once loved.<br/>It is an intense read of letting go, rich in sharp dissections of queer and leftist politics, but full of love and passion nevertheless.<br/><br/>///</p>
<p><strong>„Warum ich aufgehört habe, Merch für eine Revolution zu machen, die nicht passiert.“<br/>ist ein schwindelerregendes Essay über Kunst, Aktivismus und Überleben als Künstler_in in aktivistischen Zusammenhängen. </strong><br/><br/>Dieser innerhalb weniger Tage niedergeschriebe innere Monolog fängt mehr als zwei Jahrzehnte voller wertvoller Erfahrungen als auch herber Enttäuschungen ein und verknüpft das Aufwachsen in einer DIY-Familie mit geschätzten und gefragten Qualitäten sowohl in gegenwärtigen Subkulturen als auch im größeren Zusammenhang Neoliberalismus.<br/>Es ist eine sehr persönliche Betrachtung des Kampfes um einen Lebensunterhalt als autodidaktische_r und professionelle_r Künstler_in innerhalb alternativer Strukturen und wie nahe (Selbst-)Ausbeutung und Ernüchterung gehen und persönlich treffen können.<br/>Die Story beginnt in den Überbleibseln des Punk in den 80ern, streift die Anfänge von Streetart sowie anarchistische und queerer Subkulturen in Berlin und endet schließlich 2016, wo Frustration, Langeweile und Missbrauch zu der schwierigen Entscheidung führten, sich selbst zu kündigen und das einst heiß geliebte aufzugeben.<br/>Es ist intensiver Lesestoff vom Loslassen, reich an scharfen Analysen queerer/linker Politiken und trotz allem voller Liebe und Leidenschaft zu ihnen.</p>
<p> </p>

</div></div>","Good books are rare.Even more rare are good books for small money.
Edition assemblage always manages to find the good stuff and spread it for an affordable price but unfortunately their admirable dedication is not enough to cover all the financial costs of publishing.
This book is done, out and available as of now, but there are still some expences of the publishing process to cover. This is the reason for this crowdfunding with all its amazing perks by Yori Gagarim, most of them handmade.///
Gute Bücher sind selten.Noch seltener sind gute Bücher zum kleinen Preis.
Die edition assemblage schafft es immer wieder kleine literarische Schätze aufzutreiben und zu erschwinglichen Preisen unter die Leute zu bringen.Das alles funktioniert mit viel Idealismus aber leider nicht ohne finanzielle Mittel.
Dieses Buch ist zwar fertig und ab sofort erhältlich, allerding sind leider noch nicht alle Kosten gedeckt. Deswegen gibt es dieses Crowdfunding mit vielen wunderbaren Perks von Yori Gagarim, die meisten davon handgemacht.

The Book /// Das Buch
""Why I Stopped Making Merch for a Revolution That Does not Happen.""is a bitter love story/essay about survival as an artist in activist communities.Written down within a couple of days, this inner monologue captures more than two decades of precious experiences and harsh disappointments, and connects growing up in a DIY-family to marketable skills in recent subcultures and neoliberalism.It is a very personal approach on how to make a living as a self-taught DIY artist while doing professional work in alternative communities, and how (self)exploitation led to disillusionment. The story starts with the leftovers of punk in the 1980s, glances at the beginnings of street art, anarchist, and queer subcultures in Berlin, and comes to an end in 2016 when frustration, boredom, and abuse led to this difficult decision: stepping back from something once loved.It is an intense read of letting go, rich in sharp dissections of queer and leftist politics, but full of love and passion nevertheless.///
„Warum ich aufgehört habe, Merch für eine Revolution zu machen, die nicht passiert.“ist ein schwindelerregendes Essay über Kunst, Aktivismus und Überleben als Künstler_in in aktivistischen Zusammenhängen. Dieser innerhalb weniger Tage niedergeschriebe innere Monolog fängt mehr als zwei Jahrzehnte voller wertvoller Erfahrungen als auch herber Enttäuschungen ein und verknüpft das Aufwachsen in einer DIY-Familie mit geschätzten und gefragten Qualitäten sowohl in gegenwärtigen Subkulturen als auch im größeren Zusammenhang Neoliberalismus.Es ist eine sehr persönliche Betrachtung des Kampfes um einen Lebensunterhalt als autodidaktische_r und professionelle_r Künstler_in innerhalb alternativer Strukturen und wie nahe (Selbst-)Ausbeutung und Ernüchterung gehen und persönlich treffen können.Die Story beginnt in den Überbleibseln des Punk in den 80ern, streift die Anfänge von Streetart sowie anarchistische und queerer Subkulturen in Berlin und endet schließlich 2016, wo Frustration, Langeweile und Missbrauch zu der schwierigen Entscheidung führten, sich selbst zu kündigen und das einst heiß geliebte aufzugeben.Es ist intensiver Lesestoff vom Loslassen, reich an scharfen Analysen queerer/linker Politiken und trotz allem voller Liebe und Leidenschaft zu ihnen.

<h3>Hi, I'm Bird</h3>
<p>I first saw the light of day in Pennsylvania in 1944, but turned 11 years old in Florida. I dropped out of MIT in 1965 thinking that something was missing (science was great, but wasn’t the full human story), and eventually graduated from the University of South Florida with a BA in English literature in 1967.  Upon returning to Boston I was swept up in the anti-war, hippie movement.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516648348/gqgo3zvyy0m2s51owsld.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>I started writing songs &amp; traveled throughout the US. In 1975 I began practicing Tibetan Buddhist meditation. In 2007, I recorded a CD of original songs entitled ‘<strong>Now Here This</strong>‘. In 2011 I self-published “<strong>Extreme Times: Diary of an Eco-Buddhist</strong>“. Over the last few years I've been compiling an album of demo tracks called ""<strong>Offering</strong>"", which includes songs mentioned in my book, as well as ""Way of the Bhoddisattva"" (spoken word with music).<br/><br/>Now, in 2018, I have a <u>new collection of songs to record</u> (to be entitled ""<strong>Prayer Wheel</strong>""), and a lot of great ideas for even more ways to get my message out. You can see more of my ork, and messages at <a href=""http://birdthompson.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">my website</a>.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516648529/nussl3txjysmvosdpd9i.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/><br/><br/>Recording, publishing, artwork, printing, and distribution for these endeavors will be no easy task though.  So, over the last two years I've sourced some of the best, and most cost-efficient means of getting the book and CD out, and and been lucky enough to have been gifted time, expertise, and equipment from friends.  But as cost-efficient as the services, people and gear I've sourced are, my only hope of really achieving this goal, and getting this project finished is help with funding from you, the ones who believe in a kinder human existence shared through art, music, and words.<br/><br/>I'm confident that the <strong>$8500</strong> I'm trying to raise will be enough to finish the creative aspects of the albums, as well as cover the costs of publishing, printing (manufacturing), and an initial promotion of the finished products.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How We're Doing It</h3>
<p>Right now, I'm working to finish my new album, release two old albums, and promote my book to get their collective message out into the world.  I'm honored and lucky to have a lot of creative friends who have volunteered their time or resources to this project already, but we still have a long way to go to cover the rest of our costs, which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Studio time and session musicians for ""Prayer Wheel"".  I've secured some incredibly reduced rates at a Santa Fe studio. ( We're expecting this to cost about $4500)</li>
<li>Art for three albums (two of which are already recorded, but unreleased) ($2,500)</li>
<li>Publishing, distribution and initial marketing costs ($1000)</li>
</ul>
<p>In exchange for helping get the albums finished and released, you'll not only know you've helped push out a message the world needs to hear right now, but we've come up with some pretty cool packages in exchange for your contributions.  Most supporters will end up with at least the new album (think of it as a pre-order, with a personal thank you to YOU up on my website), and options to get the previous album ""<strong>Now Here This</strong>"", some never before released audio recordings, signed copies of my book, and more.  Plus, for those who are brave enough, I've even included a level that will feature YOU on the new album.  Of course, if you really like my stuff and what I'm doing, why not have me put on a private concert? Got any other ideas for ways you'd want to help, or ways I can thank you for your support in this?  Send me a message!  I'd love to hear your thoughts.<br/><br/><strong><i>(Any perks that include items already manufactured, like the previous album or book, can be shipped immediately upon your contribution.  Perks that contain items that we are looking to fund, will ship AS SOON as they are completed, no later than Jan 2019.) </i></strong><br/><br/>Unfortunately, there's always the possibility of not reaching our goal for funding, in which case, any money already donated will still go to recording ""Prayer Wheel"", releasing all 3 albums and book, and promotion for all releases, just as we would with the full funding.  Though we'll have to cut some corners, maybe play the chorus to track 2 on a kazoo instead of a Les Paul (you get the idea). We WILL still be able to deliver on all of the perks, even if the album is a little more shoestring than I'm aiming for.  Don't worry, we're releasing this project one way or another!</p>
</div><div>
<p>Of course, if you can't help out in the traditional monetary sense, I hear you (why else would I be fund-raising...), but you can help the cause in SO MANY other ways, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing this page with friends who know may be interested. You can copy the URL directly, or use the ""share"" buttons at the top right of this page, right above all the awesome perks!<br/> </li>
<li>Do you know someone who can donate any of the expenses we are looking to cover?  Does your uncle own a studio we can record in?  Maybe your sister is a printer who would be interested in printing the CD wallets? Donating the things we're trying to pay for is even better than helping us pay for them through an outside source.  I'd much rather support your business in kind somehow!</li>
</ul>
<p>I can't stress enough how much every little thing helps!</p>

This is the image presented to people who come to visit our beautiful country. But when you take a closer look at the fragrant flowers and alluring fruits you can see decay and vermin crawling amongst the flower petals and spring shoots.Patriotism for Sale exposes the rot in shocking detail. The truth should be exposed.    What is it about?This complex work of investigative journalism tells the true story of Slovenia’s independence in 1991, which was the first episode in Yugoslavia’s terrible wars of the 1990s. It has been in the making for the past ten years and places the reader in the eye of the storm, amid ground-breaking events that shook the whole of Europe. It is based on tens of thousands of documents and graphic testimonies by over a hundred key witnesses. 
  What else?Patriotism for Sale exposes a vast mafia network, the secret dealings of arms lobbyists and hushed-up multi-million euros deals made away from prying public eyes. It tells unpleasant truths about the young aspiring Slovenia that have been suppressed. It exposes outrageous facts about the rising star of the Balkans that you could not find out for yourself. 
  Attempts at a coverupThe wrongdoers named in the book are keeping quiet, shifting the blame on to others, and denying all responsibility. These war-mongers are annoyed, and protest that Patriotism for Sale is harming Slovenia’s image. As they include some of the country’s most influential political figures, many Slovenian citizens fear to speak out against them. 
  What is the purpose of this book?Vermin are to be found feasting on the fragrant petals of blossoming trees across Europe. That is why we wish to bring this ground-breaking work of investigative journalism beyond the small country of Slovenia. We wish to make the book accessible on the frozen steppes of Ukraine, the shores of suppressed Catalonia, lonely, grassy inlets of Scotland and the exploited summer islands of Greece.    Why we need your support?With your donations we plan to take the revelations of Patriotism for Sale to readers all over the world. We wish to overcome any attempts to suppress this important universal message.Most of the funds collected will go towards promotion of the book:
Distributing Patriotism for Sale to bookshops all over Europe.
Sending the book to foreign institutes and universities.
Bringing Patriotism for Sale to the attention of a wide range of organizations and institutes that tackle corruption around the world.

The reader of these Sufi Trail guidebooks will get extended historical information as well as the trees and the bees that decorate the scenery and detailed hiking maps to keep you on track.</p>
<p>We have been brought up with the stories of the great Sufi masters and this makes making the Sufi Trail a journey into your childhood feelings of fairytales and imagination. The influence of the great Sufi masters and their works get relived while sniffing up the smell of nature awakening in spring in Turkey.      </p>

</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>To publish the Sufi Trail guidebooks we need your help</h3>
<p>We have recently founded the Sufi Trail foundation to operate under the umbrella of an official body. The Sufi Trail is a long-distance hiking trail that covers 801 km from Istanbul to Konya.</p>
<p>With the money we collect:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Publish the two guidebooks in print, pdf and in the near future e-pub</li>
<li>Publish the Sufi Trail Passport </li>
<li>Creating artwork and postcards</li>

</ul>
<p>Breakdown of the cost:</p>

<li>Sufi Trail passport € 2.000,-</li>
<li>Postcards including artwork € 750,-</li>
<li>Sufi Trail t-shirts € 1.250,-</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal we can still produce and create all items with lower quantities. In case we have more than our goal then we will be able to pay a fair price for the design delivered and the artwork that was created for the guidebooks.   </p>
<h3>Let's walk the Sufi Trail together!</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1514146694/eyrppsdmmadarmjogl33.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>What you will gain</strong></h3>
<p>Giving your time and energy to people is about the most precious gift humans can give to each other. Your full attention will have a great influence on many levels. By pre-ordering the Sufi Trail books you will energize and stimulate a long chain of people who have helped build the Sufi Trail project by giving it their full attention when the time was right.

We hope of course that these feel-good vibes and supporting a positive movement will radiant back to the people who get involved. Of course, we hope it will mostly leave you with an exciting feeling about the Sufi Trail project and the start of a journey within or on the Sufi Trail.</p>
<ul>

<p><strong>Now, as we are approaching the final design stage, the costly step of printing the book is our next challenge. By purchasing the publication you are enabling its production, and becoming our Sufi </strong><strong>Trail partners</strong><strong>!</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1514192363/egiah32cir0qloafwmz3.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Most of the risks and challenges are in the marking and maintaining the trail. We have a very skilled group of volunteers in the Netherlands, People for creating promotion materials, maintaining the website and social media accounts etc. but not so much local people involved with maintaining the trail. With this project, we hope to attract more local volunteers.</p>
<ul>
<li>We were lucky to meet many skilled and enthusiastic volunteers in Turkey and the Netherlands.</li>
<li>We are looking for local community support to start developing maintenance programmes.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Supported by local and international partners and people like <strong>you</strong>, the Sufi Trail represents a global community of inspired thinkers and big dreamers who see the hope and potential for a </i><i>deeper human connection</i><i> that </i><i>the Sufi</i><i>  Trail provides.</i></p>

We have recently founded the Sufi Trail foundation to operate under the umbrella of an official body. The Sufi Trail is a long-distance hiking trail that covers 801 km from Istanbul to Konya.
With the money we collect:  

Publish the two guidebooks in print, pdf and in the near future e-pub
Publish the Sufi Trail Passport 
Creating artwork and postcards
Manufacture the official Sufi Trail t-shirts

Breakdown of the cost:

Two guidebooks € 12.500,-
Sufi Trail passport € 2.000,-
Postcards including artwork € 750,-
Sufi Trail t-shirts € 1.250,-

If we don't reach our entire goal we can still produce and create all items with lower quantities. In case we have more than our goal then we will be able to pay a fair price for the design delivered and the artwork that was created for the guidebooks.   
Let's walk the Sufi Trail together!

What you will gain
Giving your time and energy to people is about the most precious gift humans can give to each other. Your full attention will have a great influence on many levels. By pre-ordering the Sufi Trail books you will energize and stimulate a long chain of people who have helped build the Sufi Trail project by giving it their full attention when the time was right. Positive feelings about humankind, the rich history, and appreciation of the amazing hiking ancient trails preserve and protects much-needed love for each other and your environment. We hope of course that these feel-good vibes and supporting a positive movement will radiant back to the people who get involved. Of course, we hope it will mostly leave you with an exciting feeling about the Sufi Trail project and the start of a journey within or on the Sufi Trail.

When the basics are set for the Sufi Trail we hope to repeat many marking events with young people that have painted and marked already parts of the Sufi Trail.
Stimulate local communities to treasure their pilgrim path’s and rich in heritage.
Protect and preserve natural paths and cultural heritage.


Now, as we are approaching the final design stage, the costly step of printing the book is our next challenge. By purchasing the publication you are enabling its production, and becoming our Sufi Trail partners!


Risks & Challenges
Most of the risks and challenges are in the marking and maintaining the trail. We have a very skilled group of volunteers in the Netherlands, People for creating promotion materials, maintaining the website and social media accounts etc. but not so much local people involved with maintaining the trail. With this project, we hope to attract more local volunteers.

We were lucky to meet many skilled and enthusiastic volunteers in Turkey and the Netherlands.
We are looking for local community support to start developing maintenance programmes.

Supported by local and international partners and people like you, the Sufi Trail represents a global community of inspired thinkers and big dreamers who see the hope and potential for a deeper human connection that the Sufi  Trail provides.


THANK YOU
The thought of reaching our goal and completing this project successfully is extremely exciting to us. Sedat and I are waiting eagerly to send you your books, postcards, t-shirts and Sufi Trail passport.
 
We want to thank you for your attention and support
and we hope you join us and share this
with your friends!

This cognitive estate rests on the stability provided by basal gender complementarity, which signifies by actualizing natural synergy across male and female gender borders and thus also, validates respective roles in an ever-challenging environment according to circumstances.

<p>_____</p>
<p>Nearly everyone who didn’t really know him, including him, was charmed and convinced of Oscar Wilde's sterling character until he simulated a morally superior rook on truth's hill, which collapsed during his war against the Crown and which, in turn, buckled his curious defense. Even the object of his desire, an arrogant twit, abandoned the unfortunate bugger shortly after his release from prison. His repute as ‘sterling’ was as fictional as his reliance on the Greek pederast mythos in court. This grand pathos signified extraordinary talents for disaster including infidelity, extraordinary debauchery, flagrant irresponsibility, creative pseudo-reality and casuistry—all for the cause of suggesting LGBT moral superiority. Taken altogether, the madness actually endorsed the cardinality of authentic heterosexual identity in human relations, which is sufficiently challenging on its own without complications. And moreover, relations based on affectation are actually none at all; a puff of smoke in a dragon’s den of lies that lingers ‘till the earth quakes and topples one’s hearth, as it did with Mr. Wilde.</p>
<p>Despite his role as mentor to a spoiled effeminate sprite, Mr. Wilde disguised masochistic fears of abandonment with bravado even as his lover abused him. He then nailed himself to the cross of idealism as hero of his own tall tale. Similar psychopathology (drama) anoints the stage and plagues sexually ambiguous humans in the absence of meaningful love relationships. For far too many, insufficient social integration of a wobbly identity offers little purpose beyond ephemeral pleasures of touch, inebriation, vain intellectualism and celebrity. They therefore languish like droppings on a hollow monument to futility in a neglected corner of a garden, bereft of vibrant quanta drawn from tender loving care and carpeted by the moss of mourning over a life never lived because it is unapproachable. All properly Victorian and no fit dwelling for any human let alone an ideal rook made of mythologized sand. The condition therefore requires the best remedies available, which are truth and compassion.</p>
<p>The stolid heterosexual ""I"", male or female, educated and not, is fixed rather than fluid and necessary for the stabilization of social relations and institutions. The veracious basal requirement for masculine repose, for example, demands approbation from males who mate females and support, protect and provide for them and their offspring. How this is done is immaterial to the basal male-identity kernal and has and everything to do with validation. For unmarried males, the same kernal demands that they support mated males and their offspring without further qualification. The reader can easily extrapolate basal requirements for the feminine kernel. More importantly, validated and validating signifiers (men &amp; women) establish this patently unambiguous gender matrix in the absence of uncertainty, which is precisely why the nebulous term ‘<i>significant other</i>’ was deployed to undermine the hegemony of legitimate marriage and heterosexual identity.</p>
<p><strong>_____</strong></p>
<p>Licit heterosexual consummation confronts us with constraints in the material constitution of human ‘being’. These appointments present a predetermined gendered schema (archetypes) with defined perimeters for highly regulated purposes. We cannot cross these borders except artificially, nor can we alter them without severe consequence, nor did we have any epistemological say or sway whatsoever in their several matters and manners or quintessence of manufacture. We can only cooperate, or not, with said circumstances in agreement with determinants that are clearly in “<i>service of the consolidation of the heterosexual imperative</i>” (ibid. p 13), which is another way of saying <i>regulatory ideal</i>. As the reader will learn, there are no explicit LGBT imperatives because sexual drives and orientations are basally masculine or feminine. Thus, the same constraints apply to the ambivalently gendered who, despite all objections, usually model one or the other depending on cerebral bent.</p>
<p>_____</p>
<p>Marriage is superbly represented by traditional dance. Tango and Flamenco, for example, demonstrate measures of reiterative antipathy (divergence) and sympathy (convergence) between archetypically gendered sovereigns who play at the edge of human ‘being’. Extraordinary rhythms and physical grace reveal an irreducible mystery celebrated again and again by the triumphant shout, “<i>Ole</i>!” LGBT substitutions and mimes can never match such masterful displays of authentic masculine and feminine congruity. Here is where elegance mirrors the place where ‘beauty and beast’ in each partner balance the push and pull of personhood, will and quanta as they turn the gyros of spontaneous creativity. Here we find Rumi's 'mystic dynamo', not unlike twin suns or Saturn's dancing moons; faithfully waxing and waning between tides of coherence and incoherence in obedience to unambiguous gender imprints of confirmed and confirming identities. Well-matched partners not only perform what is innately choreographed but also learn to improvise and thereby generously transcend mundane plodding to realize individual and collective allotments of celestial promise. </p>

<p>I began my career as a paperboy at age eight, became a medical doctor by 38, an academician at age 56, wrote several books and papers and am now retired at age 67. Along the way I noted that marriage, family and gender identity have been mercilessly attacked by unsocial elements, causing much confusion, social chaos and even bloodshed.

<p><i>Book Size: W230 x H280 mm with a half flap soft cover. Cover design might be slightly changed.</i></p>
<p>The present catalogue project is the first attempt to publish Georgian film posters in the form of a printed publication. Georgian cinema has a long history pre-dating the Soviet era. In the period under totalitarian rule, directors from Georgia produced important artistic oeuvres, some of them banned from distribution and not known to a wider public, and others winning prizes in leading international film festivals. But cinéastes are generally unacquainted with the posters of films which praised Georgian cinema on both sides of the iron curtain. This catalogue will try to fill the gaps in the history of Georgian film.</p>
<p>The publication of this catalogue of Georgian Cinema Posters marks the centenary anniversary of Georgian Independence Day on 26th May 1918. After the collapse of the Russian Empire, Georgia elected the world's first-ever social-democratic government and became the Georgian Democratic Republic. </p>

The present catalogue project is the first attempt to publish Georgian film posters in the form of a printed publication. Georgian cinema has a long history pre-dating the Soviet era. In the period under totalitarian rule, directors from Georgia produced important artistic oeuvres, some of them banned from distribution and not known to a wider public, and others winning prizes in leading international film festivals. But cinéastes are generally unacquainted with the posters of films which praised Georgian cinema on both sides of the iron curtain. This catalogue will try to fill the gaps in the history of Georgian film.
The publication of this catalogue of Georgian Cinema Posters marks the centenary anniversary of Georgian Independence Day on 26th May 1918. After the collapse of the Russian Empire, Georgia elected the world's first-ever social-democratic government and became the Georgian Democratic Republic. 
                
The catalogue will include over 80 Georgian cinema posters from 1926-2000. An exhibition of 30 rarely seen posters  will be on at  Terroir Trafalgar Square from 1st-8th May 2018 as part of the 5th London Georgian Film Festival.  This exhibition has been realised by Bella Radenovic-Tsulukidze. Come and see them!
 


 


 

One early influential Georgian film is the mesmerising and visually stunning masterpiece My Grandmother 1929 (Chemi Bebia). The poster is equally brilliant.
 
            
This campaign coincides with GEORGIA 100: A FILM FEAST. The 2018 festival brings top chefs from Tbilisi restaurants Azarphesha and Poliphonia see Humble Magic In Georgian Capital’s Restaurant Renaissance. Creating a unique opportunity for Londoners to taste this great cuisine first hand.  Do not miss a chance to get a copy of this book together with some ""Early bird"" offers  to see the screenings.

I get so overwhelmed by the response that I can't keep up with it all. I have a team + I'll hire an assistant or two if needed. 

The biggest risk & challenge are rolled into one - change. Changes in your life once you read this book. When your energy shifts during exploration and discovery - your life can't help but change. The challenge is to roll with the changes as the risk is to roll with the changes into the unknown. 


It's one hell of a journey you do not want to miss!

   Facebook Posts1) I know so many people who are looking for a soul connection that gives them a feeling of intimate belonging that is bigger than themselves. 
I think we look for love, acceptance, and intimacy  in connections, even those connections that are not
 romantic in nature. We want a relationship that touches our soul in all
 the right places. 
Are you ready to have your soul touched in all the right places?

Yet, livestock emissions are largely ignored and there are no books that focus on assessment of this critical issue.</p><p>We hope to raise enough funds to get this book published and distributed at the Paris climate talks in December 2015 to climate negotiators.</p><p><b>What's Inside The Book?</b></p><p>The book is around 375 pages in length, neatly organized, and well-documented, with over 600 references that represent a comprehensive, multidisciplinary analysis of the global food system. Importantly, the book also provides an excellent background on climate literacy, and great insights into climate politics.</p><p>Meat Climate Change: The 2nd Leading Cause of Global Warming serves as a guidebook to climate science and dietary change, and related environmental, social and psychological issues. It examines the impacts of climate change and diet on the poor, water, forests, soil, oceans, biodiversity and health.</p><p>Specifically, the book discusses how animal-based diets contributes to the three main greenhouse gases - carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. It explains in detail how livestock's greenhouse gas contributions are assessed and are significantly undercounted. Notably, the book compares future GHG emission projections for fossil fuel and animal-based industries.</p><p>Dr. Moses Seenarine is a plant-based father and activist, and founder of <a href=""http://cc911.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Climate Change 911</a>. He is the author of Voices from the Subaltern (2004), and several articles on climate, environment, animals, gender, caste and migration. His work has been cited by the FAO, UNESCO, Human Rights Watch, Anti-Slavery International, the Institute for the Study of Labor, World Council of Churches, and many others.<br/></p><p><b>How Will The Money Be Used?</b><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437625754/admpgtakiad5citkys2g.svg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b></b></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Producing and marketing a book is expensive, and we really want to get Meat Climate Change into the hands of climate experts, negotiators and stakeholders.</span><br/></p><p>The $10,000 budget allows us to edit, design, market, and print copies of the book, and to send review copies to universities, institutes, and non-profit organizations. We will ensure the printed edition is of the highest quality possible. We plan to get the book translated into different languages and delivered to libraries across the world. This budget also allows us to journey to Paris in December 2015, we can present the book directly to climate negotiators attending a major climate conference there. </p><p>Translation, travel and shipping play a major role in determining our budget, and comprise a significant portion of expenses.

Yet, livestock emissions are largely ignored and there are no books that focus on assessment of this critical issue.We hope to raise enough funds to get this book published and distributed at the Paris climate talks in December 2015 to climate negotiators.What's Inside The Book?The book is around 375 pages in length, neatly organized, and well-documented, with over 600 references that represent a comprehensive, multidisciplinary analysis of the global food system. Importantly, the book also provides an excellent background on climate literacy, and great insights into climate politics.Meat Climate Change: The 2nd Leading Cause of Global Warming serves as a guidebook to climate science and dietary change, and related environmental, social and psychological issues. It examines the impacts of climate change and diet on the poor, water, forests, soil, oceans, biodiversity and health.Specifically, the book discusses how animal-based diets contributes to the three main greenhouse gases - carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. It explains in detail how livestock's greenhouse gas contributions are assessed and are significantly undercounted. Notably, the book compares future GHG emission projections for fossil fuel and animal-based industries.Dr. Moses Seenarine is a plant-based father and activist, and founder of Climate Change 911. He is the author of Voices from the Subaltern (2004), and several articles on climate, environment, animals, gender, caste and migration. His work has been cited by the FAO, UNESCO, Human Rights Watch, Anti-Slavery International, the Institute for the Study of Labor, World Council of Churches, and many others.How Will The Money Be Used?Producing and marketing a book is expensive, and we really want to get Meat Climate Change into the hands of climate experts, negotiators and stakeholders.The $10,000 budget allows us to edit, design, market, and print copies of the book, and to send review copies to universities, institutes, and non-profit organizations. We will ensure the printed edition is of the highest quality possible. We plan to get the book translated into different languages and delivered to libraries across the world. This budget also allows us to journey to Paris in December 2015, we can present the book directly to climate negotiators attending a major climate conference there. Translation, travel and shipping play a major role in determining our budget, and comprise a significant portion of expenses. More details on the budget and the rewards are available on the website. If you have more specific questions, like tax-deductible or matching contributions, please message us in the comments section, or email us at meatclimatechange@gmail.comWhat's In It For You?There are many perks that are part of this fundraising campaign, including book recommendations, posters, and videos.

<p>I was an undecided
child, a... <i>lost</i>  teenager, who had no
great idea of what she wants to do with her life. I went to an economy high
school but numbers and I got along together as much as cats and dogs did. I was
scared in a crucial moment of a young person’s life, when most decide what they
want to do further in life. The fantasies with doctors and teachers disappear,
and the true vocations come out. For me, nothing came from nowhere and I was
simply standing in the middle of my life, not finding that lust I wanted to
chase after.</p><p> It was there… the whole time, just before it could count for my
future. It just took me awhile to discover it.</p>
<p>I was a terror for
my literature teachers. Every time I had to write a project… well, I forget to
stop from writing. That is where it all started and from there to this passion I have for
writing was only one step.</p>
<p>I started a book
from the desire I had to withdraw myself from the world, or the desire to
create my own world. One upon which I had absolute control. I discovered this
amazing digital platform, <a href=""https://www.wattpad.com/home"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Wattpad</a>, with millions of writers from all around the
world and I created an account in my own country. </p>
<p>I had no idea of what
I was getting myself into.</p><p><a href=""https://www.wattpad.com/user/XCalypsoX"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">My Wattpad Profile</a><br/></p>
<p>I was just a reader
at the beginning, I couldn’t even think about the fact that I would become a
famous writer among the others. But I couldn’t abstain myself, I had to many
ideas to keep them for myself so I tried my luck and started posting my books.</p><p><b><i>Everything got crazy...</i></b></p>
<p>Nothing was perfect
from the beginning but <a href=""https://www.wattpad.com/story/5163315-dangerous-love-i-obsession"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dangerous Love</a> was. It started growing with readers very
fast, until it overcame every expectation I had and became the number one book
on the website for my country.</p>
<p>That is where the
problem appears. <i>My country.</i></p>
<p>I am from Romania
and here everything is hard, no matter how good you are. I am 21 years old, I
gave up university from the lack of funds and my writing talent helped me get a
job in the editorial of a local newspaper, with a monthly income which can’t
help me pursue my dream anytime soon.</p>
<p>Back to my teenager
years; shortly, I knew what I wanted to do with my life, more than that, I
discovered that I am very good at what I had chosen for myself. I wrote the
first book from the series and decided to publish it, for the millions of
readers from the online environment who wanted it printed. But that proved to
be a challenge harder than I expected. Shortly, you can’t do anything without
your own money otherwise you are skinned… literally.</p><p><br/></p><h3><b>The problems begin...</b></h3><div><b><br/></b></div>
<p>So, after many more
attempts and grotesque contracts with many publishers, I decided to take that
matter into my own hands and try to finance the book on my own… Like I
discovered all the writers from my country do.</p>
<p>The first book from
the “Dangerous Love” series counts, up to present date, five million reads
online and all of them are from the small and invisible Romania, about which
one out of five strangers knows anything but Dracula and Transylvania. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459597880/f_fxpauk.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>I want my book to
cross the borders, because it’s a story anyone can enjoy, from any part of the
world, exactly because of that reason I chose to saw it’s thread on American

have a dream for so long that it becomes a part of your life? It is in your
thoughts every day. You fight for it and try to achieve it on so many paths
that, at last, you forget their number?Well, I have a
pretty good answer for this.How the story begins...
I was an undecided
child, a... lost  teenager, who had no
great idea of what she wants to do with her life. I went to an economy high
school but numbers and I got along together as much as cats and dogs did. I was
scared in a crucial moment of a young person’s life, when most decide what they
want to do further in life. The fantasies with doctors and teachers disappear,
and the true vocations come out. For me, nothing came from nowhere and I was
simply standing in the middle of my life, not finding that lust I wanted to
chase after. It was there… the whole time, just before it could count for my
future. It just took me awhile to discover it.
I was a terror for
my literature teachers. Every time I had to write a project… well, I forget to
stop from writing. That is where it all started and from there to this passion I have for
writing was only one step.
I started a book
from the desire I had to withdraw myself from the world, or the desire to
create my own world. One upon which I had absolute control. I discovered this
amazing digital platform, Wattpad, with millions of writers from all around the
world and I created an account in my own country. 
I had no idea of what
I was getting myself into.My Wattpad Profile
I was just a reader
at the beginning, I couldn’t even think about the fact that I would become a
famous writer among the others. But I couldn’t abstain myself, I had to many
ideas to keep them for myself so I tried my luck and started posting my books.Everything got crazy...
Nothing was perfect
from the beginning but Dangerous Love was. It started growing with readers very
fast, until it overcame every expectation I had and became the number one book
on the website for my country.
That is where the
problem appears. My country.
I am from Romania
and here everything is hard, no matter how good you are. I am 21 years old, I
gave up university from the lack of funds and my writing talent helped me get a
job in the editorial of a local newspaper, with a monthly income which can’t
help me pursue my dream anytime soon.
Back to my teenager
years; shortly, I knew what I wanted to do with my life, more than that, I
discovered that I am very good at what I had chosen for myself. I wrote the
first book from the series and decided to publish it, for the millions of
readers from the online environment who wanted it printed. But that proved to
be a challenge harder than I expected. Shortly, you can’t do anything without
your own money otherwise you are skinned… literally.The problems begin...
So, after many more
attempts and grotesque contracts with many publishers, I decided to take that
matter into my own hands and try to finance the book on my own… Like I
discovered all the writers from my country do.
The first book from
the “Dangerous Love” series counts, up to present date, five million reads
online and all of them are from the small and invisible Romania, about which
one out of five strangers knows anything but Dracula and Transylvania. 
I want my book to
cross the borders, because it’s a story anyone can enjoy, from any part of the
world, exactly because of that reason I chose to saw it’s thread on American
land. 
They wrote about my
book in the newspapers...1. Uncrowned queen of the virtual environment2.  A story that cand inject adrenaline into your veins3. The story of a young writer girl from Olt4. Georgiana Sandu, resounding success in the virtual environmentThey made news report... 
1. A book with 4.2 million readers online 

2. The biggest online writer 
It's great to be in a show where you can speak about your work to so many people.






They were proud with the
success of a book in Romania, but that is where the story stopped. Oh, there
were a couple of promised, but of course none of them was serious. I am an
unknown debutante, with parents who don’t work behind a desk and don’t have
incomes with lots of zeros, so that means no chances for me to do something
with my passion.I have a facebook group for my book, for readers who wants to be always in touch with me. Dangerous Love Facebook GroupOr my facebook profile.Nothing is more amazing than meeting my fans 
But enough about
me, this is what Dangerous Love is, shortly:Story review""A Wild angel.
That  is what they called her. 
A beautiful
face, wicked be the treason of the one who gave birth to her.
After the
divorce of her parents,  Katherine’s life
changes radically. She gives up all her plans for the future and falls into the
trap of drugs and a destructive and unrestrained life style. When her father
manages to pull her out of the darkness,
he decides to move with her into another city, which actually hides all the
family’s tumultuous secrets. People whom she 
never knew existed appear into her life and threaten to take away the
little of happiness she had left. After she lost her mother because of money,
Katherine is close to losing her father too when she finds out she is not his
only daughter, and that Christopher Wrise hide another life and family about which she never knew. 
The strikes
don’t stop in the life of the young girl who didn’t knew sadness and who
thought her life was boring and monotonous. 
Not everybody
has a guardian angel and Kath feels that on her skin when she meets her own
demon, who will not guard her soul, but devour it in the most passionate and
dangerous way possible.
Harris Stone
is the perfect demon, apparently with a stone heart, incapable of loving, with
a fatal past which leaves deep scars on this actual personality, which
transforms crime into his favourite sport. He has nothing to lose and no
consequences to endure, that is his motto… until he meets Katherine and beating
head to head with death doesn’t seem so fun anymore.
Pride takes
the first place at the beginning, but is rapidly demolished by the obsessive
lust which grows in between them and they become for one another the one reason
of existence. 
 The warnings upon Katherine appear right from
the first second Harris shows interest on her, but she can’t stop herself from
heading to him like Icar towards the sun, even if she knew she was going to be
destroyed. She becomes the martyr of her own life and she puts her entire trust
in this man, who, despite his love, refuses to tell her who he really is.
She knows him
as being a problematic man, passionate about car races and very territorial,
but she gets a brutal dose of danger and adrenaline when her lover’s true life
comes to light, and places her right in front of death.""Book Trailer - made by a fan. (The actors had been chosen after the look of the caracters)

Hún er með söguna, Höggið.
Brot úr sögunni Höggið:

Brot úr sögunni Helvíti kalt:
Mér rann kalt vatn milli skinns og hörunds þegar ég fikraði mig inn þröngan kirkjuganginn og smeygði   mér fram hjá líkkistunni sem stóð fyrir neðan altarið.

  Hildur Enóla

Brot úr sögunni Bara Krakki:
Konný hafði sloppið út um gluggann á náttfötunum og hlaupið út í nóttina berfætt í snjónum. Eftir það var hún send í húsið, þar sem hinir krakkarnir voru bara í heimsókn, og allir voru skrítnir.
Brot úr sögunni Fullorðin:
Það kom á óvart að það ógeðslegasta var ekki augun, heldur hárið sem losnaði af við suðuna. Hún þurrkaði það með hárþurrkunni og brenndi í eldhúsvaskinum.

Brot úr sögunni, Fatan:
Max teygði úr sér og það brakaði í öllu sem brakað gat. Beinum og brjóski, rúminu og gormunum í dýnunni. Það var svo heitt að rúmið var blautt af svita. Hann vaknaði án þess að notast við vekjaraklukku. Ef hann ætlaði sér að vakna á ákveðnum tíma þá gerði hann það bara.

Brot úr sögunni, Síðasta nóta lífs þíns:
En eins og er með öll alvöru listaverk þá vakti það innra með mér gamlar tilfinningar sem ég taldi að hefðu glatast í tímans rás. Mér varð kalt, einmanaleikinn var nánast yfirþyrmandi og sorgin ætlaði að gleypa mig yfir löngu orðnum hlut.
Allt í einu var ég ekki lengur hér. Ég var komin til baka, sextán ár aftur í tímann.

Brot úr sögunni Ég heiti Ísleifur:
„Fimm mínútur líða. Ég sit í forstofunni og stari á barnslegt hrafnaspark Janusar á undirritunarlínu móttökubréfsins. Upp fyrir mér rennur sá sannleikur að það sem maður eyðir mestri orku í að áorka í lífinu er á endanum sjaldnast til góðs. Sú Dröfn sem ég kynntist var öðrum gefin. Hún var ekki gift honum kannski, en hann átti hana. Til að ná henni þurfti ég að synda upp í brimið. Stíga í vænginn við konu annars manns og kalla yfir mig bölvun guðanna. En ég varð að ná henni. Og þegar maður hefur náð Dröfn þá getur maður ekki sleppt...“

 

Samvinnusaga 

Hildur Enóla & Sirrý Sig. eru með samvinnusöguna Gullbúrið.
Brot úr sögunni Gullbúrið:
Hún var að smeygja sér úr skónum þegar Edda teygði sig skyndilega yfir borðið og renndi fingrunum í gegnum hár hennar. Þessi fræga setning, hárin risu á bakinu, fékk loksins raunverulega merkingu.

The Impact
 
This book cannot happen without these final interviews and research. The first half of the book is completed - (even edited!) - my adventure in Brazil over the past 8 years, and the ""scholarly"" research, ( I've read everything under the sun that even contained two sentences about Egúngún). I have a well-known University publisher awaiting my proposal, and have the support and encouragement of two of the foremost scholars on African Diasporic religious heritage, Dr. Ivor Miller and Robert Farris Thompson (""you must write a book""). There is literally nothing written specifically about Egúngún in English since a 1969 Brazilian article and an obscure out-of-print pamphlet by Nigerian author Babayemi from 1980. There is the classic issue of African Arts dedicated to Egúngún edited by Henry Drewal, but other than these we see no recent work as such. There are a smattering of obscure articles and minuscule references to Egúngún in works about the Orisa tradition; it's a very limited pool of knowledge. This work will surely fill a gap and bring to light the perception of a modern-day Orisa practitioner and hopefully shed some light on the history, spirituality and and profoundness of the Egúngún tradition.
Risks & Challenges

 I can write this book. I am close. There is the realistic risk that a major publisher will not take it on. In this case i am completely prepared to self-publish, but i do not predict that as a necessity based on initial interest and the scarcity of material available on this subject.

I'm asking all those who supported the development and creation of the ""Relationship Dismount"" to do The same for my latest relationship book idea, ""The Holographic Relationship: A Deeper Look into the Spiritual Meaning Behind Intimate Relationships"" This book will be designed to go into the spiritual purpose behind intimate relationships,  using examples ranging from world religions all the way to quantum mechanics. Most people know all too well the potentially negative impact of societal rules on intimate relationships.   The societal relationship norms/contructs  are usually passed on  By friends, and family as a means of being seen and accepted as normal. This book will try to open our minds to an even deeper understanding/purpose for interacting in today's high paced technologically driven society.  So In the same way that I honored everyone who donated to the relationship dismount book project, by placing the names of donators in the book's acknowledge Segment,  I will do the same for all those who share a piece of themselves with me to bring this work to fruition as well. 
I am asking for $75,000 to help fully develop all aspects of this indiependant work, which includes but not limited to Writing, copy editing, graphics, printing, audio book development, commercial video production shoot, formatting re-writes, artistic cover design, marketing, radio, and social media promotions. These are just a few of the areas that your donation will be used to greatly help further life this product to the awareness of those who may need this work The most.
   The Impact 
The ""Relationship Dismount..."" Relationship workbook was simply volume one in a series of intimacy building books aimed at educating, healing and expanding the consciousness surrounding the rift between men and women within the world of relationship. I believe that better/more flexible  relationships models are the linchpin to solving all the worlds problems surrounding all forms of relationships. Please help me realize this dream by donating today!!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Even if the different parahumans have prejudices against one another, they're able to put it aside to make their community safer for themselves and for their children.

<li>THE PURPLE DOOR DISTRICT has everything I want from an urban fantasy series--a big, diverse community of characters who have the same general goals but are at odds with each other as far as how to achieve them, a great blend of high stakes action scenes and poignant emotional moments, and the looming threat of a group of Hunters determined to track down and eliminate magical beings.<strong> --Amazon Review</strong>

<li>It has been a very long time since a book has made me cry, in sadness and joy. The emotion in these characters is so moving, you can't help but feel you are there with every character through a ride of a story.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I am very passionate about entrepreneurship and love sharing my thoughts on social media. I previously wrote ""Social Media for Entrepreneurs"" and then ""Things Entrepreneurs Say"" but now it is time to do a bigger book focused on the journey of an entrepreneur:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interviews with a select group of founders</li>
<li>Insight into how they started, mistakes along the way and lessons</li>
<li>Framework for decision-making and recommended books, as well as why</li>
</ul>
<p>This book is for the person facing the tough journey or contemplating it. Learn from the mistakes others so that you can make new ones instead. This is not a book written by a White American guy either so expect it to be far more focused on the reality of building a business as a minority.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The details:</p>
<ul>
<li>The book is going to be published no matter what</li>
<li>Many of you want perks for being early adopters/supporters</li>
<li>I want to also give back to charity and pay it forward</li>
<li>That means perks like signed copies, a free 1-hour consultation with me, a live speaking event and even hanging out with me at either Walt Disney World or in Jamaica (your choice!)</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution is an indication of support as a pre-order as well as a way to get some quality time with me to help you with your own journey:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not enough people have mentors that they can be open with</li>
<li>Two books previously published and positive reviews</li>
<li>Thousands of people with positive things to say from interactions with me</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As a transparent person, I must say that this project is one of the low-risk ones that I have done because I oversee the execution and I get my books done. The biggest challenge is actually publishing and shipping the physical books, which is not such a big deal. The bigger challenge will be if a publishing house offers me a book deal for the book and then I would have to organize a transfer of your pre-orders, but then that would also be so awesome to have supported a book that got picked up before it was released!</p>
<ul>
<li>Previously published and printed books</li>
<li>Any publisher will be made aware of the pre-orders if they actually offer a deal</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot contribute, that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the word out and make some noise about the campaign</li>
<li>Use the Indiegogo share tools!</li>
<li>Tell a friend</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi everyone, I’m Alex Hernandez writer of “Lucy Veloz, The High-flying Princess,” the story of a smart, brave girl who uses her marvelous inventions to become a superhero when the conquering Drood arrive on her planet. There’s science, adventure, valor and a whole lot of fun, all brought to life by the incomparable art of Patrick Lugo.</p>
<p>The book is an early reader, aimed at ages 6 – 8. It’s divided into short, manageable chapters with accompanying illustrations.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Super-Heroic Mission</h3>
<p>As a parent of two daughters who love to read science fiction, fantasy and superhero stories, my wife and I strive to find books with compelling female leads. It hasn’t been easy, but we’ve managed quite a little collection over the years (Shout out to AMightyGirl.com for all the help!), but one thing is sorely missing from our kids’ book shelves: Latina heroes! We can’t find them anywhere. Certainly not in the realm of sci-fi/fantasy. My daughters do not see themselves reflected in the books we read. There are no niñas valientes that look or sound like them, going off on rip-roaring escapades, matching wits with shrewd villains and saving the day.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Big Bad</h3>
<p>It’s not for lack of trying! Believe me, we’ve looked everywhere. Some mind-boggling statistics, because I’m a nerd:</p>
<p>Based on 2018 Amazon data, only <strong>18%</strong> of the bestselling children’s books had a female protagonist and according to Time’s 100 Best Children’s Books of All Time, just <strong>19%</strong> of the most critically acclaimed children’s books had female protagonists.</p>
<p>To compound things, a mere <strong>5%</strong> of books published in 2018 depicted a Latinx character, as found by the Cooperative Children’s Book Center, School of Education, University of Wisconsin-Madison.</p>
<p> <strong>5%!!!</strong> In 2018!  And that’s both male and female. If you look at only Latina characters, the percentage becomes abysmal.</p>
<p>You can help us change that. Support our campaign, get an amazing book and help Lucy Veloz, The High-Flying Princess zoom into the hands of children everywhere.</p>

Editing, illustrating, printing, shipping, and marketing the book all cost money. The bottom line is that writing a book is expensive, and advertising to get it into the hands of the people who need it, can be even more so. This crowdfunding campaign gives us a MAJOR head start and gives you a discount on the book <i>and </i>some fun bonus perks along the way!</p><p>By contributing to this project, you’ll not only be inspired by the beautiful story of hope contained in the pages of this book, but you’ll give others that gift as well.</p><p>Our desire is that every single person who reads this story comes away with a deep sense of encouragement, comfort, and renewed joy.</p><h2> </h2><h2>Who is Danielle?</h2><p>Danielle Hanosh is an English teacher, author, and the co-founder and Executive Director of Blackberry Creek Farm Animal Sanctuary, a non-profit animal rescue and education center. Raised in the suburbs, she now lives with her husband and over 90 rescued animals in the foothills of Northern California.</p><p>In her late twenties, after experiencing personal loss and trauma, she decided to flip her life upside down,  beginning the journey of healing herself through healing others. The great gift of suffering, she soon discovered, was the increased capacity for empathy. It took processing her own grief to fully comprehend the trauma of others, and she hopes that this book will help people cope with their own painful losses.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574327499/d2hqfaxgkoqnxfae8cbq.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h2>What We Need and What You Get?</h2><p> </p><p>Our funding goal for this project is $15,000. This will cover all of the up front costs of creation and production of the book, along with shipping the first run of copies from the production center to distributors. The funds will also cover the initial marketing of the book, as well as audio and eBook formats so that the powerful message of love can reach an even wider audience. </p><p>By becoming a contributor to this campaign, you'll get a discount on the pricing of the hardback book, and special perks available only to early project backers. </p><p>Whether or not the entire goal is met, all money will go toward the production of the book and getting it into the hands of people who need to hear its powerful message. </p><p> </p><h2>Risks and Challenges</h2><p>It’s one thing to write a book and quite another to popularize it with the general public. The biggest risk associated with this project is that the book will not have enough marketing backing to get it into the hands of people who need it</p><p>The more money we raise for marketing, the more people will benefit from the hope and healing found in the pages of this book!</p><p> </p><h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2><p> </p><p>We understand that not everyone will be able to financially contribute to the launch of the book, and that’s why we’ve come up with a list of other ways to get involved!</p><p> </p><h3>Share on social media.</h3><p>Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, you name it! Social media is a quick and easy way to help spread the news!</p><p> </p><h3>Email ten friends and family members.</h3><p>Choose ten friends and family members who would enjoy the book or be supportive of it in their circles, and ask them to check it out and share!</p><p> </p><h3>Share it at work.</h3><p>Know a co-worker who has recently lost a pet or one who's a big animal lover?

<br/> </h2></div>","The Book & Its ImpactThe Other Side was inspired by the powerful, complex, extraordinary role that animals play in the lives of humans, and the deep love that remains with all of us... even after they’re gone.This magical tale and its whimsical illustrations were designed to captivate the minds and hearts of both children and adults alike as they imagine ALL of the beautiful things waiting for their animal friends as they cross the Rainbow Bridge and step off on “The Other Side.”The Other Side will also be a powerful tool in the hands of grief therapists, counselors, teachers, and veterinary offices when they are tasked with helping people grieve this very specific, and nearly universal experience.If you choose our “Rainbow Option” when contributing to the campaign, you’ll get your own copy of the book AND donate one to a therapist, library, school, animal shelter or veterinary office. Why a crowdfunding campaign? Editing, illustrating, printing, shipping, and marketing the book all cost money. The bottom line is that writing a book is expensive, and advertising to get it into the hands of the people who need it, can be even more so. This crowdfunding campaign gives us a MAJOR head start and gives you a discount on the book and some fun bonus perks along the way!By contributing to this project, you’ll not only be inspired by the beautiful story of hope contained in the pages of this book, but you’ll give others that gift as well.Our desire is that every single person who reads this story comes away with a deep sense of encouragement, comfort, and renewed joy. Who is Danielle?Danielle Hanosh is an English teacher, author, and the co-founder and Executive Director of Blackberry Creek Farm Animal Sanctuary, a non-profit animal rescue and education center. Raised in the suburbs, she now lives with her husband and over 90 rescued animals in the foothills of Northern California.In her late twenties, after experiencing personal loss and trauma, she decided to flip her life upside down,  beginning the journey of healing herself through healing others. The great gift of suffering, she soon discovered, was the increased capacity for empathy. It took processing her own grief to fully comprehend the trauma of others, and she hopes that this book will help people cope with their own painful losses. What We Need and What You Get? Our funding goal for this project is $15,000. This will cover all of the up front costs of creation and production of the book, along with shipping the first run of copies from the production center to distributors. The funds will also cover the initial marketing of the book, as well as audio and eBook formats so that the powerful message of love can reach an even wider audience. By becoming a contributor to this campaign, you'll get a discount on the pricing of the hardback book, and special perks available only to early project backers. Whether or not the entire goal is met, all money will go toward the production of the book and getting it into the hands of people who need to hear its powerful message.  Risks and ChallengesIt’s one thing to write a book and quite another to popularize it with the general public. The biggest risk associated with this project is that the book will not have enough marketing backing to get it into the hands of people who need itThe more money we raise for marketing, the more people will benefit from the hope and healing found in the pages of this book! Other Ways You Can Help We understand that not everyone will be able to financially contribute to the launch of the book, and that’s why we’ve come up with a list of other ways to get involved! Share on social media.Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, you name it! Social media is a quick and easy way to help spread the news! Email ten friends and family members.Choose ten friends and family members who would enjoy the book or be supportive of it in their circles, and ask them to check it out and share! Share it at work.Know a co-worker who has recently lost a pet or one who's a big animal lover? Share the book with your office or place of employment! Contact local veterinarians and rescue groups.Vets and their staff, along with animal rescue and shelter workers, have a high rate of burnout, compassion fatigue, and even suicide because they deal with an extraordinary amount of loss.

<h3>Your Impact</h3>
<p>Our oceans are under threat. Menaces like overfishing, habitat destruction, and dumping at sea continue unabated. As growing human activity increases the pressure on our oceans, they lose resilience and become less able to provide the ecoystem services that all creatures -- including us -- require to survive on this planet. We are gambling away our futures by abusing our oceans and the creatures that live inside them.</p>
<p><i>Umijoo </i>is a book designed to inspired ocean conservation in the hearts and minds of the younger generation. We believe that children have a deep and honest connection with the world around them, and this connection has the ability to protect and heal our planet. Your support will help to make this happen.</p>
<p>Join us and help bring the story of <i>Umijoo </i>to your friends, families, and larger communities. Help us teach future generations about the importance of caring for our oceans and making thoughtful choices in our daily lives. Together we can make a difference!</p>

<p><strong>Caia Koopman</strong> is a renowned pop surrealist painter with a devoted following. She grew up in California and spent much of her youth enmeshed in surf, skate and music culture. Caia is a dedicated environmentalist who is acutely aware that humanity is dangling this planet over a dangerous flame of pollution and misuse. She combines her urban, west-coast influences with her love of nature to produce a visually striking style, full of eccentric illustrative touches. Birds, flowers, plants, butterflies, animals and mythical creatures are interwoven with iconic symbols of love, mystery, and soul-searching to create a haunting, beautiful counterpoint to Casson's verse. </p>

<h3>Project Background</h3>
<p>The <i>Umijoo</i> project began in 2013 over a grilled cheese sandwich. </p>
<p>It was a chilly Tuesday in San Francisco. Casson was having lunch with a dear friend, an accomplished innovator and entrepreneur in modern education, who was lamenting the lack of environmentally focused children’s books. She expressed a deep concern that we were missing an invaluable opportunity to teach future generations about some of the most important issues of our time, such as climate change and environmental stewardship. This conversation prompted Casson, who had recently delivered a TED talk on environmental activism and its need for a new paradigm, to write a children’s book based on his particular issue expertise: ocean conservation and seafood sustainability.</p>
<p>At that time, Casson had already spent nearly a decade years promoting sustainability in the seafood industry, and one of the lessons he had learned was that it was important to reach an audience through multiple senses at once. Merely talking about the importance of sustainable seafood had never been as effective as feeding people at the same time and allowing the experience to assert itself. Building on this, Casson realized that the book would be of much greater impact if the verse was complemented by another sensory dimension: in this case, by gorgeous, meaningful artwork.</p>
<p>After three years of writing and revision, Casson completed the manuscript and approached Caia with a partnership proposal. They then created a project plan and storyboard, and Caia began painting in earnest in summer of 2016. A dedicated Patreon community supported the project through two years of art production, culminating in this pre-sale and forthcoming book production.</p>

Who We Are
Umijoo is the product of a partnership between two activists brought together by their shared vision of a better world.
The Author

Casson Trenor is a career marine conservation activist. He grew up on the beach in Washington State, and at some point the ocean managed to infiltrate his soul. Casson has defended whales in Antarctica with Sea Shepherd, run campaigns to reform major seafood corporations with Greenpeace, and established a number of sustainable sushi restaurants designed around the principles of ocean awareness and mindful dining. His work has been featured in books, documentaries, and periodicals around the world. Casson was awarded the title of “Hero of the Environment” by Time magazine and was recognized by the US House of Representatives as an Ocean Protection Hero. This is Casson's second book.

Caia Koopman is a renowned pop surrealist painter with a devoted following. She grew up in California and spent much of her youth enmeshed in surf, skate and music culture. Caia is a dedicated environmentalist who is acutely aware that humanity is dangling this planet over a dangerous flame of pollution and misuse.

As the book approaches its conclusion, Umijoo returns from her undersea adventures with a greater understanding of her connection with the ocean. Softly Shoreward supports the climactic moment in the story's evolution. This is a limited edition print, series of 200, 17""x22"".
 
""Deepest Connection""

Umijoo meets three different creatures along her journey, including the mischevious Okatako. Okatako teaches Umijoo about the dangers of greedy and thoughtless decisions when it comes to their impacts on the underwater world. Deepest Connection, which serves as the cover image for this first edition of Umijoo, illustrates the protagonist's first meeting with Okatako. This is a limited edition print, series of 200, 17""x26"".

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Hannah Corona and I am an author, photographer, mother and grandmother.  I have been writing since the age of ten.  I won awards such as the Whittenberger scholar and Young Author of America contests while still in high school.  I stopped writing to raise my family and now am finally following my passions to create wonderful children's books again.  </p>
<p>Raymond Beckmon from Kingman Arizona did an excellent job on the graphic art for each photograph.</p>
<p>This book, Kids A to Z is a special book project.  I have read to my children and grandchildren and anyone that has done this knows that kids want you to read the same book over and over again, which admit it, gets boring for the adult.  I wanted to create an alphabet book that didn't just say A is for apple and have a drawing of an apple.  I also loved photography and especially doing fantasy/fairytale photos of children.  Light bulb goes off, why not use real kids to model for the alphabet!  I didn't want just beautiful kids that are models, but real kids from everyday life.  Kids are the same from A to Z.  It doesn't matter if they are in a wheelchair, have down syndrome, come from different races, etc.  They are kids and just want to have fun.</p>
<p>By contributing to this book project you will not only ensure that it is published and available to anyone anywhere, but you will also be proving to the kids of the world that they can achieve their dreams no matter what their circumstances may be.  Children around the world will be able to see kids having fun in the book but also realize that these everyday kids were able to model even if they were in a wheelchair.  This book will also help kids learn because it isn't just an alphabet book.  Every page has something to explore, whether it is learning where Tasmania and Zimbabwe are or discovering an eclipse, it continues to give them new things to look for and learn about in each new photograph.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We still need about $2,000 USD to get this book finished and start shipping it out.  The funds will be used to pay for the licensing, cover artist, ISBN, and marketing campaigns.  The book will be funded by myself personally to ensure it makes it to the market but this funding will enable the book to be released in time for the holidays this very year.  So many kids are going to love receiving the book as a gift and with the help of fundraising we will work together to make sure that happens in the next two months.</p>
<p>There are some great perks from an autographed copies of the book to being a character in the next book titled, ""The Changeling""</p>
<p>All funds will be used to complete the book regardless of whether we reach the entire goal or not.  The book is written, the artwork is completed, and the only remaining things are minor enough to ensure the book goes to print one way or the other.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It's difficult to fully realize the impact your contribution will have on the children in the world because you won't be there to see a child's face light up when they examine the beautiful photographs or understand how they feel when they realize that their disability will not keep them from dreaming big and actually achieving their dreams.  In this world every word said or good deed has affected someone somewhere and the only benefit we have is knowing that someone, somewhere, in this world was affected in a positive way by each of us.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There is always some risk and challenge in day to day lives let alone tackling a project of any kind.  The risks in this project are somewhat minimal since the book is already complete and just needs that last push to reach the mass market.  The challenge for me will be if I don't receive enough funding I will have to continue to fund myself to get the book released.  This can be done and will be done but will take more time.  I have already solved most of these challenges because I fully funded the photography including buying costumes and props for the children.  In backing this book everyone can rest assured that I have already invested my own money for everything to create the book and I will work extra hard to see it succeed beyond what even I have imagined for the project.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't contribute financially for this project you can still help by sharing this Indiegogo campaign with everyone you know so that the word spreads quickly and reaches families throughout the world.</p>

<h3>About Useful.</h3>
<p>Being out of work can really affect your state of mind. We all know what it's like: one day you've got a job and you're feeling productive, valued, respected, and purposeful in your day, and the next... there's a vacuum, and it's all too easy to fall into it feeling useless. Why? It's not true at all that we <i>are</i> useless, but we <i>feel</i> useless. The truth is, we're still worthy and talented and full of potential to give, but our brains tend to play nasty tricks on us when they've got nothing else to do.</p>
<p>That's why Useful. exists: to give you some fun activity sheets to keep your head straight. Best of all, they're <strong>free</strong> to use, because money shouldn't be a factor. Seriously. Just download them.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526475324/rm18chnmbcje5lgvblin.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><i>Some Useful activity sheets</i></p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>About the Campaign</h3>
<p>To keep the Useful resources free and accessible, we're launching this fundraiser of products, sponsorships and services. The funds will be used towards the continued production of the worksheets, collaborations with industry experts for smarter tools and tips, the development of products (like books) and services, and the expansion of the platform.</p>
<p>The goal is to create a resource that benefits everyone in the new world of work.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Who's It For?</h3>
<p>Useful was originally conceived as a resource for the unemployed, with the idea of filling the vacuum often left behind by losing your job. However, it soon became apparent that people who are underemployed and sademployed would benefit just as much--sure, they've got work to keep them ""busy"" but not necessarily fulfilled. Ultimately, Useful can be helpful to anyone who is concerned about the role of work going forward in the new world, where technology advances faster than we humans can keep up with, and mass unemployment due to automation and industry-obsolesence is the norm.</p>
</div><p>We need to find new ways of relating to work.</p><p> </p><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Work is a combination of many things, including our meal-ticket. Therefore, we'd be happy if you can contribute financially to Useful, but if not, you can still help support our cause by sending this link to anyone who you think may be interested.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Learn More</h3>

</div></div>","About Useful.
Being out of work can really affect your state of mind. We all know what it's like: one day you've got a job and you're feeling productive, valued, respected, and purposeful in your day, and the next... there's a vacuum, and it's all too easy to fall into it feeling useless. Why? It's not true at all that we are useless, but we feel useless. The truth is, we're still worthy and talented and full of potential to give, but our brains tend to play nasty tricks on us when they've got nothing else to do.
That's why Useful. exists: to give you some fun activity sheets to keep your head straight. Best of all, they're free to use, because money shouldn't be a factor. Seriously. Just download them.
Some Useful activity sheets

 
About the Campaign
To keep the Useful resources free and accessible, we're launching this fundraiser of products, sponsorships and services. The funds will be used towards the continued production of the worksheets, collaborations with industry experts for smarter tools and tips, the development of products (like books) and services, and the expansion of the platform.
The goal is to create a resource that benefits everyone in the new world of work.
 
Who's It For?
Useful was originally conceived as a resource for the unemployed, with the idea of filling the vacuum often left behind by losing your job. However, it soon became apparent that people who are underemployed and sademployed would benefit just as much--sure, they've got work to keep them ""busy"" but not necessarily fulfilled. Ultimately, Useful can be helpful to anyone who is concerned about the role of work going forward in the new world, where technology advances faster than we humans can keep up with, and mass unemployment due to automation and industry-obsolesence is the norm.
We need to find new ways of relating to work. 
Other Ways You Can Help
Work is a combination of many things, including our meal-ticket. Therefore, we'd be happy if you can contribute financially to Useful, but if not, you can still help support our cause by sending this link to anyone who you think may be interested.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Jana, Ibrahim, Zena, Myriam, Valerie, Timo &amp; Max.</p>
<p>We are a group of dancers, writers, and artists who came together to create <strong>a Dance Mag</strong> because we believe that dance is a vital source of creativity, empowerment, togetherness and freedom.</p>
<p>With your support, we will launch our first issue that includes contributors from 16 countries. From Italy to Ghana, Iceland to Pakistan, Los Angeles to Beirut, the stories are pulsing with life.</p>

<h3><strong>Our Story is Your Story Too!</strong></h3>
<p>Because everyone is born a dancer.</p>
<p>Because your body deserves a voice.</p>
<p>Because our bodies have great powers to transform pain into ecstasy.</p>
<p>Because dance is not just a series of steps.</p>
<p>Because all motion could be seen as a way of dancing, if you choose to believe, as we like to believe.</p>
<h3><strong>What is a Dance Mag?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>a Dance Mag</strong> <strong>looks at the world through the lens of dance, </strong>to present an alternative view of a world that is in constant motion. Because awareness of motion — of our bodies, of ideas, of the flow and unfolding of nature — help us better understand ourselves and the world we live in.</p>
<p>Each issue of the publication is inspired by a dance flow and explores a universe of imaginaries, histories, rituals, mythologies, and narratives related to and inspired by that flow.</p>
<p><strong>a Dance Mag</strong> will publish three issues per year.</p>
<p>Our first issue explores the theme <u>Transcendence</u>. It is now on its way to print and it will be distributed in bookshops, libraries, and cultural centers around the world.</p>

<h3>Be part of this movement!</h3>
<p>Our bodies need to move. Motion is powerful. It activates, transforms, liberates, restores, and heals.</p>

<p><strong>a Dance Mag</strong> gives us the time and space to discover our body and become comfortable in it.</p>

What is a Dance Mag?
a Dance Mag looks at the world through the lens of dance, to present an alternative view of a world that is in constant motion. Because awareness of motion — of our bodies, of ideas, of the flow and unfolding of nature — help us better understand ourselves and the world we live in.
Each issue of the publication is inspired by a dance flow and explores a universe of imaginaries, histories, rituals, mythologies, and narratives related to and inspired by that flow.
a Dance Mag will publish three issues per year.
Our first issue explores the theme Transcendence. It is now on its way to print and it will be distributed in bookshops, libraries, and cultural centers around the world.

Issue 1 blossomed into the most beautiful creation, and we need your push to launch!
We chose to publish in print because we believe in the power of this medium as a transmitter of timeless narratives. We will print with mindfulness and respect to nature.
And while our hearts are in print, our sights are on other channels too – web, films, and events.

<p>Whetstone Magazine is the culmination of three years of visioning, producing and collaborating. It was started by me - Stephen Satterfield, <a href=""https://www.chefsfeed.com/stories/591-i-m-a-black-food-writer-here-s-why-we-need-more-like-me"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">a Bay Area food writer</a> and multimedia producer - and made possible by countless other contributors and subjects. Before this, I worked in hospitality for more than a decade, mostly as a manager and sommelier. I first grew interested in farm workers through a nonprofit I cofounded in 2007, called the International Society of Africans in Wine (ISAW). We made media and offered market access and support for black wineries in South Africa. I continued to study farms and local food culture as a manager at Nopa Restaurant in San Francisco, where I started a robust and respected food media project called, <a href=""http://www,nopalize.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nopalize</a>. That project was the precursor to Whetstone.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>In 2016 we embarked on an unsuccessful crowdfunding campaign with a $50,000 target.

<p>To begin, we'll be producing original quarterly periodicals on food origin.

<h3>Get swept away:</h3>
<p><i>What if there was another you, living in another world?</i></p>
<p>The Water Rushes saga is a 5 book Young Adult Fantasy series about two girls in two different worlds who become the most powerful weapons in the same war when they are accidentally switched and shown worlds they couldn't have imagined.</p>
<p>The underlying message of the books is that love can cross oceans but can it cross worlds. This pertains to both physical worlds (different realms) that lend to the fantasy aspect as well as the metaphorical worlds that people create in their minds such as gender, race, religion, sexual preference, favourite colour (!), you get the point :p</p>
<p>Book 1: At Water's Edge has made it to top 5 in bestseller categories such as epic fantasy and thrillers &amp; suspense and has been compared to some great contenders in the YA Fantasy market.</p>

<h3>Resumen</h3> <div><ul>
<li>En 2014 Todd Clouser, músico y escritor estadounidense radicado en México,  y Zazil Collins, escritora y programadora musical mexicana, configuramos el proyecto editorial <i>Músicos en la Ciudad de México</i>, en donde decidimos reunir diversas voces de músicos que habitan la ciudad para compartir entre creadores y públicos lo que acontece en esa capital musical. </li>
<li>Tras dos años de trabajo editorial en el que convocamos y asesoramos a los autores, editamos, tradujimos al inglés, gracias al trabajo de Gabriel Amezcua y Lisa Wessing, y diseñamos, con la colaboración de Daniel Zúñiga, presentamos la versión digital de nuestro primer volumen en abril y agosto de 2016, desde las instalaciones de la Fonoteca Nacional de México y el MUAC (UNAM), respectivamente, con conciertos que reunieron a algunos de los 42 autores que participan en la edición. </li>
<li>Estamos convencidos de que <i>Músicos en la Ciudad de México </i>es un documento sin antecedentes en el país, pues además de impulsar las producciones y artistas que regeneran las músicas creativas en la ciudad, salvaguarda la memoria cultural.</li>
<li>
<i>Músicos en la Ciudad de México</i>, entonces, reúne en este primer volumen a 42 músicos de diversas generaciones y nacionalidades, cuya labor traspasa las fronteras de la música.</li>
<li>Con la impresión de estos ejemplares, impulsaremos, además, la continuidad necesaria del proyecto editorial, que ya trabaja en su segundo volumen.<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span>

En 2014 Todd Clouser, músico y escritor estadounidense radicado en México,  y Zazil Collins, escritora y programadora musical mexicana, configuramos el proyecto editorial Músicos en la Ciudad de México, en donde decidimos reunir diversas voces de músicos que habitan la ciudad para compartir entre creadores y públicos lo que acontece en esa capital musical. 
Tras dos años de trabajo editorial en el que convocamos y asesoramos a los autores, editamos, tradujimos al inglés, gracias al trabajo de Gabriel Amezcua y Lisa Wessing, y diseñamos, con la colaboración de Daniel Zúñiga, presentamos la versión digital de nuestro primer volumen en abril y agosto de 2016, desde las instalaciones de la Fonoteca Nacional de México y el MUAC (UNAM), respectivamente, con conciertos que reunieron a algunos de los 42 autores que participan en la edición. 
Estamos convencidos de que Músicos en la Ciudad de México es un documento sin antecedentes en el país, pues además de impulsar las producciones y artistas que regeneran las músicas creativas en la ciudad, salvaguarda la memoria cultural.

Músicos en la Ciudad de México, entonces, reúne en este primer volumen a 42 músicos de diversas generaciones y nacionalidades, cuya labor traspasa las fronteras de la música.
Con la impresión de estos ejemplares, impulsaremos, además, la continuidad necesaria del proyecto editorial, que ya trabaja en su segundo volumen. 


LOS AUTORES del primer volumen son: Aarón Cruz, Aarón Flores, Abraham Barrera, Adrián Escamilla Greenham, Alex Eisering, Alex Mercado, Alejandro Otaola, Alonso Arreola, Arturo Báez, Arturo Tranquilino, Belafonte Ramírez, Benjamín Shwartz, Brian Allen, Carla Rivarola, Carlos Maldonado Malcisne, Daniel Aspuru Guzik, Daniel Zlotnik, David Aguilar, Denise Gutiérrez, Eduardo Piastro, Federico Sánchez, Felipe Pérez Santiago, Georgina Equihua, Zuriel López (Colectivo LXS Grises), Gustavo Nandayapa, Hernán Hecht, Helena Sánchez, Ingrid Beaujean, Iraida Noriega, Jenny Beaujean, Juan Martín Medina, Líber Terán, Luis Clériga, Natalia Arroyo, Nur Slim, Rafael Catana, Remi Álvarez, Sandra Cuevas, Saúl Fimbres, Tito Rivas, Todd Clouser y Willy Terrazas.

</div><p><b>About the Book</b></p>
<p>Ravyn Alexis
Hicks-Badger started this project when she was 7 years old. She lives with her
family: her father Rodney, her mother Crystal, and her big brother David, along
with her two cats Buddy and Lucky. </p>
<p>When Ravyn was 5 years
old, her father was offered an opportunity to work on the island of Bermuda at
a Luxury Resort. The idea of living in another country and going to school
there appealed to the family, so they moved. While living in Bermuda, Ravyn and
David were educated following the British curriculum. That is where Ravyn
developed her reading skills and her love for writing. </p>
<p>Because Crystal
(Ravyn's mom) was retired and a stay-at-home mom, the family decided to get a
cat to keep her company. Rodney (Ravyn's dad) asked his friends and co-workers
how to adopt or foster cats in Bermuda. A woman who worked with Rodney told him
about a six-month-old kitten whose owner could no longer care for him because
her cat had been hit by a car and the family could not afford to care for their cat. At that
time his name was Blue, but after a few days the family decided to change his
name to Buddy. The name Buddy really fit his personality, as he always followed
everyone around and tried to snuggle. </p>
<p>The family lived in
Bermuda for a couple of years, but decided to return to America when Rodney was
offered a position in Southwest Florida. When they relocated to America, they
had to stay in a hotel for a few weeks while searching for a new home. This is
where Ravyn and her mom came up with the idea to write a book about Buddy. Buddy
had already had so many exciting things happen in his life - from living with
two families in Bermuda to relocating to the United States - that they thought
a book would be a great way to share his adventures. </p>
<p>Ravyn came up with
lots of different ideas for the book when she first started the project, but
they didn’t really seem to fit Buddy’s personality. One day her brother David
said, “Buddy’s so lazy, I bet he doesn't do anything but lay around all day.” Ravyn
decided Buddy wasn’t lazy - he was just tired from working all day while she
was away at school. That’s when she started writing the story that became The
Adventures of Buddy the Cat: Buddy's Mouse Chasing Company.</p>
<p>Ravyn wants to share
Buddy with the world. She doesn't want people to judge a book by its cover (or
a cat by his naps). She doesn't think that Buddy is lazy, no matter what David
says. It’s important to Ravyn that kids use their imagination and to never give
up when working towards their goals. </p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>We need your help to
make this book a reality!</p>
<p>The Adventures of
Buddy the Cat: Buddy's Mouse Chasing Company is a project that’s been almost two
years in the making. We have an AMAZING illustrator in Amanda Erb. We need your
help to cover the cost of the final illustrations, publishing the book, and spreading
the word about the book.</p>
<p>Our goal is to raise
$10,000 for this project. We have some great perks planned for donors!</p>
<p>Please donate and help
Ravyn's dream come true of having her book made available to other young
children in schools, libraries and book stores across the country and around the
world.</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>We have never written
a book or done anything like this before, so we’ve partnered with a company
(Woodward Press) to help us bring The Adventures of Buddy the Cat to life. Our
family will be coordinating most of the work on the book, so the main challenge
will be to stay organized and to keep the project moving smoothly. We’ve given
ourselves a two-month timeline for our campaign and have set our delivery dates
for another two months after the campaign closes so we can be certain we have
the time to follow through on our commitments to you. </p>
<p>The family really
wants to show Ravyn that if you work hard on your dreams, they can become
reality. We’d like her to learn that although it takes a lot of hard work and
dedication to reach your goals, you should never give up on them. Ravyn has
made all of the final decisions regarding this project. She’s also attended
every planning meeting and is expected to contribute to each and every one.
During this process, she’s learning all of the different elements that go into
publishing a book. </p>
<p>We will come together
as a family to make this project come to life even if this campaign isn’t fully
funded, but we could really use your help to reduce the cost. This project is
already turning out far better than we expected. With your help, we believe we
can produce a book that has real value to children everywhere.</p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>Please donate whatever
you can. Every dollar helps!</p>
<p>If you can't donate,
please help us by spreading the word on social media platforms. We need all
kinds of support to help make Ravyn's dream of becoming an author and
publishing this book come true – so tell your friends, family, neighbors,
educators, co-workers, librarians, animal lovers and everyone about this book!</p><div>

</ul><p> </p><h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3><p><strong><i>A Summer of Fire</i></strong>  (working title) will tell the story of the historic racial justice protests across the Pacific Northwest in 2020.  Tens of thousands of civil rights activists took to the streets in Seattle and Portland to protest police brutality, the death of George Floyd, and for Black lives.  These incredible stories of inspiring activism and perseverance through brutal violence will be told first-hand by the very people who experienced this unprecedented and brutal summer.  This book will serve as a memoir to one of the most unforgettable periods in this country’s long fight for racial justice and equality. </p><p>These tales in <strong><i>A Summer of Fire</i> </strong>will be presented as short, day-in-the-life recountings from some of the most prominent people around the protests.  Black activists and organizers.  Field medics and ad hoc security forces.   Journalists and legal observers.  Politicians and community leaders.  From the unforgettable scenes at Seattle's Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, to the terrifying showdowns between ‘Wall of Moms' and federal forces in Portland, the book will take the reader through a four-month journey of communities struggling to face the demons of racism and police brutality they have yet to excise.  The narrations of perseverance, pain, triumph, and tragedy are critical, enthralling stories that will captivate readers during this tumultuous time of racial and political unrest. </p><p>Alongside these stories will be an incredible collection of photographs to help paint a vivid picture of the events described.  We hope the book will serve as a critical, captivating memoir of an unforgettable summer in the Pacific Northwest.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Editors, and Authors</strong></h3><p><strong>Seth Dunlap</strong> is a freelance journalist who has covered the protests in Portland and Seattle throughout 2020.   Seth has a background in broadcast television and radio, and was a nationally published columnist.  He shifted to covering activism and issues involving racial justice and equity and has worked to bring the authors and editors together for this inspiring project.  Seth has always envisioned eventually shifting to a career in long-form writing, and this book gives him a chance to combine two of his great passions; social justice activism and creative writing.  </p><p><strong>Latisha Jensen</strong> is an emerging journalist with Willamette Week newspaper based in Portland, OR.  Latisha pursued a journalism degree and a Spanish major at Washington State University. She has freelanced for other publications including the Spokesman-Review, Washington State Magazine and Streetroots. Her work with Willamette Week involves elevating the voices of people of color, immigrants and refugees who live in outer East Portland and were pushed to the eastern edges of Portland through gentrification and racist policies. She hopes to continue to center these voices and experiences of marginalized communities through this book.</p><p><strong>Karlos Dillard</strong> is an author, entertainer and foster care advocate.

 SummaryA Summer of Fire  (working title) will tell the story of the historic racial justice protests across the Pacific Northwest in 2020.  Tens of thousands of civil rights activists took to the streets in Seattle and Portland to protest police brutality, the death of George Floyd, and for Black lives.  These incredible stories of inspiring activism and perseverance through brutal violence will be told first-hand by the very people who experienced this unprecedented and brutal summer.  This book will serve as a memoir to one of the most unforgettable periods in this country’s long fight for racial justice and equality. These tales in A Summer of Fire will be presented as short, day-in-the-life recountings from some of the most prominent people around the protests.  Black activists and organizers.  Field medics and ad hoc security forces.   Journalists and legal observers.  Politicians and community leaders.  From the unforgettable scenes at Seattle's Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, to the terrifying showdowns between ‘Wall of Moms' and federal forces in Portland, the book will take the reader through a four-month journey of communities struggling to face the demons of racism and police brutality they have yet to excise.  The narrations of perseverance, pain, triumph, and tragedy are critical, enthralling stories that will captivate readers during this tumultuous time of racial and political unrest. Alongside these stories will be an incredible collection of photographs to help paint a vivid picture of the events described.  We hope the book will serve as a critical, captivating memoir of an unforgettable summer in the Pacific Northwest. Editors, and AuthorsSeth Dunlap is a freelance journalist who has covered the protests in Portland and Seattle throughout 2020.   Seth has a background in broadcast television and radio, and was a nationally published columnist.  He shifted to covering activism and issues involving racial justice and equity and has worked to bring the authors and editors together for this inspiring project.  Seth has always envisioned eventually shifting to a career in long-form writing, and this book gives him a chance to combine two of his great passions; social justice activism and creative writing.  Latisha Jensen is an emerging journalist with Willamette Week newspaper based in Portland, OR.  Latisha pursued a journalism degree and a Spanish major at Washington State University. She has freelanced for other publications including the Spokesman-Review, Washington State Magazine and Streetroots. Her work with Willamette Week involves elevating the voices of people of color, immigrants and refugees who live in outer East Portland and were pushed to the eastern edges of Portland through gentrification and racist policies. She hopes to continue to center these voices and experiences of marginalized communities through this book.Karlos Dillard is an author, entertainer and foster care advocate.

Both my book and my foundation are titled ‘How to Cancer 101’ and I am here to raise funds for my foundation. I can proudly tell you that my book has just been completed and it is ready for publication, while my foundation is also getting stronger with me as I recover each day from the most painful experience of my life.</p><p>When I was diagnosed with cancer for the 6th time, as oddly as it may sound, I felt all of a sudden that I had finally found my calling. I realized that the purpose of my calling or this spiritual awakening if you will, was to help, support and guide cancer patients, sexual assault victims, and people who have lost their loved ones and their families. </p><p>Being a six time cancer survivor is not easy at all, but I am really proud that I was able to overcome all the physical and emotional pain, and I came back stronger and more determined with a purpose in life and an awakening of a lifetime. I want to be remembered as a fighter, a warrior, an inspiration to many, a motivation, and I want to be the hope in your soul to keep fighting and to not allow anyone else to determine your own life expanse but yourself and God.</p><p>As a child growing up in Western Europe, I grew accustomed to eating the natural, non-preservative types of food that were only grass fed, grown and raised in Europe as a normality. A place where your bread must be thrown out after 3 to 4 days, as it is no longer edible. Where beef, chicken or pork is not the size of 2 normal fists as opposed to 1. A meal that was not pumped with steroids and preservatives as here at some places.</p><p>In middle school I remember sticking up for the one who was mentally challenged and would always be picked on by the bullies. What was little old me was going to be able to do, but I stood my ground or something anyway. I must have ended up upside down in the trash can on the schools playground almost every day for a year for opening my mouth, but they never picked on him again, so my mission was accomplished. I also got teased because I always had my head in a book, I just sometimes wonder where they are at today.</p><p>Eleven years after moving to the United States from Belgium, I was diagnosed with a Stage-3 breast cancer, hormone receptor positive, which is an aggressive kind. My toughest cancer was cancer number 5 and during my 5th, I was also diagnosed with my 6th cancer, which was a Stage-3 Melanoma on my foot.

<p>In me since I was a child, I finally found the voice to write my book at 56. I resolved that my words must be shared.  The vow happened during my New Warrior Adventure Weekend where I discovered my voice and my story. Our world needs more vibrations of wonder, love and compassion . Habits must be benevolent in the nature of service to our fellow man. By sharing these ideas, concepts, and philosophies anchored in ancient beliefs, blended with practical techniques we invite much-needed change good for the planet. By invested years presenting and creating space for progressive dialogue with learners from all walks of life, I've discovered certain inherent traits. Behaviors that filled the empty spaces between tense moments in meetings and collaboration. Magical transformations happen when groups are given permission to play at being successful. That is what this book teaches and asks to be shared.  </p>
<p>This fundraising campaign will provide the cash needed to complete final editing, formatting and publication of the book, Dance with Levity. Teaching part-time, I operate on a meager budget. I am reaching out for help so that this information can be made available on a wide scale.  The book will serve as a calling card to promote live group dialogues where the concepts of playful kindness from my book can be assimilated and shared in real-time connected conversations.</p>

<p>Nightscape Press needs your help. After our 2018 Kickstarter for Ashes and Entropy, the success of both that campaign and our Charitable Chapbooks line as well as the incredibly positive reaction to Ashes and Entropy gave me a boost of confidence that led me to believe we could manage to launch these projects without the help of Kickstarter. This was a huge miscalculation on my part and one I've been struggling with trying to correct on my own for far too long.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1598054051/b38qwzposrhqoommesmg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is where you come in. We have all the content to create two amazing projects with full color artwork by brilliant artists like Harry O. Morris, Luke Spooner, Don Noble, and Aeron Alfrey, and fantastic stories by an astonishing array of talented horror and weird fiction authors.</p>
<ul>
<li> The Secret Gateways  hardcover boxset will be a boxed set of three hardcovers including two modern classics of unsettling weird fiction: The Secret of Ventriloquism by Jon Padgett and Gateways to Abomination by Matthew M. Bartlett; and a third slim volume titled The Latham-Fielding Liaison consisting of four weird mind-bending tales written by both authors in collaboration with each other.</li>
<li> Nox Pareidolia is my fifth anthology and a This is Horror Award Winner, a Bram Stoker Award Finalist, and an Indie Horror Award Finalist. The book was published in eBook and black and white trade paperback editions last year and includes stories by Laird Barron, S.P. Miskowski, Brian Evenson, Kristi DeMeester, Michael Wehunt, Gwendolyn Kiste, Zin E. Rocklyn, Christopher Ropes, Doungjai Gam, Alvaro Zinos-Amaro, Carrie Laben, Kurt Fawver, David Peak, Don Webb and Duane Pesice, Paul Jessup, K.H. Vaughan, and more. The plan is to publish a deluxe color trade paperback edition in the same stunning quality as our 2018 color trade paperback editions of Ashes and Entropy. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1598054290/hwg84agfsuxmepjojsqp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We currently have a portion of the funds needed to produce these two projects but we still need more than we can reasonably raise on our own in a reasonable amount of time. So, we're doing this Kickstarter to fill our budget gap for these two projects and we believe we have a lot of great things to offer to help make that a reality.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1598054521/p77l71hlbjx2qfvg9sds.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Perks</strong></h3>
<p>In our last Kickstarter we had a lot of different physical chapbooks as perks and this caused us a lot of headaches and ended up costing us way more than we expected it to for a number of reasons, not the least of which being that the printer we were working with at that time and that we had based our costs upon was Createspace and Amazon dissolved Createspace literally in the middle of our campaign. So, this time we're trying to focus more on the actual items we need to raise money for and keep the physical extras to a minimum.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1598054549/zyzitrpjqzmqubh9odom.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>But that doesn't mean we're not offering some amazing perks. Just feast  your eyes on some of the wonderful offerings we have. We've got everything from eBooks of The Latham-Fielding Liaison and Nox Pareidolia to signed rarities that WILL NEVER BE AVAILABLE AGAIN like a one-of-a-kind brand new hand-sewn WXXT chapbook from Matthew M. Bartlett called Peak Deviations. And the bundles! There are bundles for everyone no matter whether you're a fan of eBook bundles at an incredible value or a super-collector looking for a bundle of rare spectacular books and other items to give a loving new home to. And then, for me, I think one of the greatest portions of what we have on offer are our non-physical rewards. Fantastic private Zoom entertainment like a Jon Padgett ventriloquist show with his non-human dummy,  Reggie McRascal!</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Budget</strong></h3>
<p>These two hefty projects carry a rather large price tag. We have already footed a chunk of the bill through pre-order sales and our own personal funds. Thus far between paying toward the cost of artwork, author payments/advances, marketing, some other pre-production costs, we have about $5,000 left to go toward an overall combined production/shipping cost of $18,000. </p>
<p><strong>This breaks down as follows: </strong></p>
<p>Secret Gateways remaining production cost: $7,000</p>
<p>Nox Pareidolia color paperback remaining production cost: $3,500</p>
<p>Fees, taxes, and estimated cost to cover rewards and shipping: $4,500</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge to this project is funding. We have a two-year track history of working with the printer we'll be using for Nox Pareidolia (their quality is amazing, as anybody who owns a copy of Ashes and Entropy or any of our Charitable Chapbook titles can tell you) and while the printer we'll be working with for Secret Gateways is new to us, their quality is superb as well and they are an industry leader with an exemplary record.</p>
<p>For two years now we have been publishing our Charitable Chapbooks line and given that 1/3 of the proceeds of each of those titles goes to charity and another third goes to the author, the budget for those is very very tight. As such, we are not a profiting company. The two projects this Kickstarter is for were conceived at least partially to help bring in income toward the cost of running a small press with a focus on giving to charity and paying authors a fair rate. And, as mentioned above, unfortunately that plan blew up in our faces due to my own poor decision to avoid using Kickstarter for the amazing tool that it is.</p>
<p>I won't lie, our Kickstarter for Ashes and Entropy was one of the most stressful experiences my family has ever gone through. You put a lot of yourself out there, it requires an incredible amount of your time, energy, and mental health, and there is no break, no half time. There's the goal and you and it can put you in a constant heightened sense of alert from the moment you launch until the moment you hit the finish line. Even after you've hit your goal.</p>
<p>But, we learned a lot from the last Kickstarter and we are more mentally prepared to face this challenge this time. And we have a better handle on how to organize and run one of these things. But we also have a lot more to lose this time around. The biggest risk for us right now is the likelihood that, should we not meet this goal, the debt we've incurred in these projects will mean that we very well might have to close up shop as a publisher for good once we've refunded all previous pre-orders. But with your help, that won't have to happen and we can continue to make fantastic books of horror, weird fiction, fantasy, and science fiction while contributing to some of the most worthy and important charities working today and paying authors good money.</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","Nightscape Press needs your help. After our 2018 Kickstarter for Ashes and Entropy, the success of both that campaign and our Charitable Chapbooks line as well as the incredibly positive reaction to Ashes and Entropy gave me a boost of confidence that led me to believe we could manage to launch these projects without the help of Kickstarter. This was a huge miscalculation on my part and one I've been struggling with trying to correct on my own for far too long.
 

 
Here is where you come in. We have all the content to create two amazing projects with full color artwork by brilliant artists like Harry O. Morris, Luke Spooner, Don Noble, and Aeron Alfrey, and fantastic stories by an astonishing array of talented horror and weird fiction authors.

 The Secret Gateways  hardcover boxset will be a boxed set of three hardcovers including two modern classics of unsettling weird fiction: The Secret of Ventriloquism by Jon Padgett and Gateways to Abomination by Matthew M. Bartlett; and a third slim volume titled The Latham-Fielding Liaison consisting of four weird mind-bending tales written by both authors in collaboration with each other.
 Nox Pareidolia is my fifth anthology and a This is Horror Award Winner, a Bram Stoker Award Finalist, and an Indie Horror Award Finalist. The book was published in eBook and black and white trade paperback editions last year and includes stories by Laird Barron, S.P. Miskowski, Brian Evenson, Kristi DeMeester, Michael Wehunt, Gwendolyn Kiste, Zin E. Rocklyn, Christopher Ropes, Doungjai Gam, Alvaro Zinos-Amaro, Carrie Laben, Kurt Fawver, David Peak, Don Webb and Duane Pesice, Paul Jessup, K.H. Vaughan, and more. The plan is to publish a deluxe color trade paperback edition in the same stunning quality as our 2018 color trade paperback editions of Ashes and Entropy. 

 

 
We currently have a portion of the funds needed to produce these two projects but we still need more than we can reasonably raise on our own in a reasonable amount of time. So, we're doing this Kickstarter to fill our budget gap for these two projects and we believe we have a lot of great things to offer to help make that a reality.
 

 
Perks
In our last Kickstarter we had a lot of different physical chapbooks as perks and this caused us a lot of headaches and ended up costing us way more than we expected it to for a number of reasons, not the least of which being that the printer we were working with at that time and that we had based our costs upon was Createspace and Amazon dissolved Createspace literally in the middle of our campaign. So, this time we're trying to focus more on the actual items we need to raise money for and keep the physical extras to a minimum.
 

 
But that doesn't mean we're not offering some amazing perks. Just feast  your eyes on some of the wonderful offerings we have. We've got everything from eBooks of The Latham-Fielding Liaison and Nox Pareidolia to signed rarities that WILL NEVER BE AVAILABLE AGAIN like a one-of-a-kind brand new hand-sewn WXXT chapbook from Matthew M. Bartlett called Peak Deviations. And the bundles! There are bundles for everyone no matter whether you're a fan of eBook bundles at an incredible value or a super-collector looking for a bundle of rare spectacular books and other items to give a loving new home to. And then, for me, I think one of the greatest portions of what we have on offer are our non-physical rewards. Fantastic private Zoom entertainment like a Jon Padgett ventriloquist show with his non-human dummy,  Reggie McRascal!

Budget
These two hefty projects carry a rather large price tag. We have already footed a chunk of the bill through pre-order sales and our own personal funds. Thus far between paying toward the cost of artwork, author payments/advances, marketing, some other pre-production costs, we have about $5,000 left to go toward an overall combined production/shipping cost of $18,000. 
This breaks down as follows: 
Secret Gateways remaining production cost: $7,000
Nox Pareidolia color paperback remaining production cost: $3,500
Fees, taxes, and estimated cost to cover rewards and shipping: $4,500
 
 
Here's some pictures of the fine books we have produced over the years: 
 
 


 

 

 

And you can find more pictures of our books on our website at Nightscapepress.pub 

The Secret Gateways hardcover box set will be printed with Print Ninja


 
Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge to this project is funding. We have a two-year track history of working with the printer we'll be using for Nox Pareidolia (their quality is amazing, as anybody who owns a copy of Ashes and Entropy or any of our Charitable Chapbook titles can tell you) and while the printer we'll be working with for Secret Gateways is new to us, their quality is superb as well and they are an industry leader with an exemplary record.
For two years now we have been publishing our Charitable Chapbooks line and given that 1/3 of the proceeds of each of those titles goes to charity and another third goes to the author, the budget for those is very very tight. As such, we are not a profiting company. The two projects this Kickstarter is for were conceived at least partially to help bring in income toward the cost of running a small press with a focus on giving to charity and paying authors a fair rate. And, as mentioned above, unfortunately that plan blew up in our faces due to my own poor decision to avoid using Kickstarter for the amazing tool that it is.
I won't lie, our Kickstarter for Ashes and Entropy was one of the most stressful experiences my family has ever gone through. You put a lot of yourself out there, it requires an incredible amount of your time, energy, and mental health, and there is no break, no half time. There's the goal and you and it can put you in a constant heightened sense of alert from the moment you launch until the moment you hit the finish line. Even after you've hit your goal.
But, we learned a lot from the last Kickstarter and we are more mentally prepared to face this challenge this time. And we have a better handle on how to organize and run one of these things. But we also have a lot more to lose this time around. The biggest risk for us right now is the likelihood that, should we not meet this goal, the debt we've incurred in these projects will mean that we very well might have to close up shop as a publisher for good once we've refunded all previous pre-orders. But with your help, that won't have to happen and we can continue to make fantastic books of horror, weird fiction, fantasy, and science fiction while contributing to some of the most worthy and important charities working today and paying authors good money.

</div><header><h3>Qui suis-je ?</h3></header><p>Ah, quelle question ! Je m’appelle Aube, j’ai 43 ans et je suis québécoise. Mais avant tout, je suis facile à reconnaître : je suis la p’tite qui marche en béquilles et qui rigole tout le temps !</p><p><b>Pourquoi les béquilles ?</b> Parce que j’ai une malformation de l’extrémité des os et que les cartilages de mes articulations se désagrègent. Les béquilles m’aident à marcher, mais surtout à marcher plus longtemps car cette dysplasie spondylo épiphysaire me vaut en fait surtout de la douleur chronique. En effet, qui dit cartilages qui se désagrègent (arthrose), dit inflammation et qui dit inflammation dit douleur.

Je m’appelle Aube, j’ai 43 ans et je suis québécoise. Mais avant tout, je suis facile à reconnaître : je suis la p’tite qui marche en béquilles et qui rigole tout le temps !Pourquoi les béquilles ? Parce que j’ai une malformation de l’extrémité des os et que les cartilages de mes articulations se désagrègent. Les béquilles m’aident à marcher, mais surtout à marcher plus longtemps car cette dysplasie spondylo épiphysaire me vaut en fait surtout de la douleur chronique. En effet, qui dit cartilages qui se désagrègent (arthrose), dit inflammation et qui dit inflammation dit douleur. En utilisant des béquilles, je mets moins de poids sur mes jambes ce qui limite un peu l’inflammation.

<p>Für die Glawes ist es wichtig, Produkte immer ganz frisch zu liefern. Ohne Kühlmöglichkeit müssen sie bisher oftmals schon um 3 aufstehen, damit das Gemüse frisch beim Kunden ankommt.</p>

<h3>Aline Morena by Hermeto Pascoal</h3>
<p>Hermeto Pascoal's multifaceted and strikingly unique music has influenced innumerable musicians worldwide. A multi-instrumentalist and composer practically since birth, Hermeto's professional career lasting seven decades (and counting) has led to meetings and collaborations with some of the most important musicians of the 20th and 21st centuries — Miles Davis,  Airto Moreira, Sergio Mendes, and Dominguinhos, to name a few. However, it is as a bandleader, teacher, and the creator of <i>música universal  </i>(universal music) that his shadow has loomed largest. A prolific composer, only a minute fraction of his work has been seen or heard by the world at large.</p>
<p>Hermeto's thirteen year partnership with singer, multi-instrumentalist and composer Aline Morena was a fertile era of creative output, documented on two albums,  <i>Bodas de Latão</i> and <i>Sensações,</i> as well as two film projects,  <i>Chimarrão com rapadura and Hermeto Brincando de Corpo e Alma.  </i>(The latter project was also produced by Morena). It is with great pleasure that we now make another part of their musical legacy, <i>Aline Morena by Hermeto Pascoal<i>,</i></i> two hundred previously unpublished compositions dedicated to Aline, available to musicians and scholars for the first time.</p>
<h3>Aline Morena says:</h3>
<p><i>Durante os 12 anos que vivi com o Hermeto, presenciei ele compondo todos os dias, mas nem em sonho imaginaria que em 2015, quando nos separamos como casal, ele chegaria com um presente tão especial! O Hermeto me entregou um livro manuscrito com 200 composições inéditas e disse: ""Isto tudo aqui é você!"" De ""Aline Morena 1"" a ""Aline Morena 200"". Com certeza, o presente mais incrível e honroso de toda a minha vida!</i></p>

<p>Hi, my name is Billie King,  I'm the author of the memoir Billie and I hope to raise $11,975  to Market and Promote the book.  Billie is  being  put to the test  and proves to be a contender for a bestseller!</p>

<p>Billie  is  going through her fair share of it all, a bizarre relationship that would be considered sick in the
minds of most, but even through her naivety, she see’s it as her safest place. And
a mother, while risking her sanity and even own life to save, she is constantly
being endangered and derailed struggling to keep her balance.  By the age of
ten, misguided, lost and abused, she is already on the verge of a breakdown. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Poverty, drug addiction and dysfunction  within the household  often take center stage as wild cards in her life, and yet she is driven
by a force most do not understand.  She proves that, with strength of will, resilience, and a dedication to her artistic destiny, all things are
possible. She is no ordinary girl.</p>

After tireless years of trying to make sure she  did not succumb to her extremely hazardous lifestyle, she developed a blood infection and became septic. This type of infection has a 90 % mortality rate. For  the first time, there was nothing I could do to  save her.  It had us in the hospital for 45 brutal days.  Yes, that's right, us.  I never left her side.  I slept in a cot right  next to her. I tossed out the blood tinted urine from the bed pans and emptied the puke buckets.  She's mom, and  just like it had been my entire life,  I was there to look after  her. </span><p></p>

It was actually the first time I heard her pray without it being over food. And for me, it was the revealing of her strength that gave me the strength to finally let go.  To take my hands off her and allow for God to take over. Something that I had prayed for for a long time.</span></p>

<p>Reviewed by Jack Magnus for Readers' Favorite </p>
<div>5 Stars!<p>Billie King's non-fiction memoir, Billie, is a ferociously honest and incredibly moving story that gripped me from the very first pages. I found myself staying up later and later as I became reluctant to interrupt her narrative. Billie is beautifully written in a style that makes the reader feel as though he were in the room with the author as she related her life story. Her story never descends into self-pity or moroseness. She remains steadfast throughout, remaining resilient, resourceful and ready to face whatever comes her way.</p>
<br/>Reviewed By Gisela Dixon for Readers' Favorite<br/>5 Stars!<p>Billie is a raw, compelling memoir and I felt that it was written from a very honest and genuine place: no frills, no embellishments, just plain facts. The fact that all three of them (Billie, her sister Nia, and their mother) struggled with these issues at various levels and are still able to love one another and stay strong and supportive of each other is a wonderful thing.  I applaud Billie for coming out with this memoir.  All in all, a gritty, compelling memoir that is a must-read!</p>

<div>Sandra K Dolberry Read the book. Very well written. Moved swiftly and smooth to every event.<br/>May sound like a fiction to some because many instances were somewhat unbelievable, but very true. What makes it more amazing is that the author still stands strong. Knowing first hand that this IS a true story I can't wait to read the fiction.<p></p>

<div>A powerful, emotional true story about coming of age. Wow! Only ten years old and slaying the dragons of hell with one hand and holding her own heart, and her mother's heart in the palm of her other hand. Billie King strives to keep her mental balance, courage, and artistic dreams alive.<br/>I wanted to give my shoulder as a place of rest for her head. Some of the pages got wet and I was not cutting onions. I could picture holding onto her hand and walking with her, but both her hands were full of life's daily twist, turns, surprises, tunnels and perplexing predicaments.<br/>Between rage and laughter, innocence lost, and tragedy to triumph, Billie King opens her soul with the doors and windows wide open.<br/>After reading this true story, I took a look into the windows of my own soul.</div>

</div></div>","Short Summary 

Hi, my name is Billie King,  I'm the author of the memoir Billie and I hope to raise $11,975  to Market and Promote the book.  Billie is  being  put to the test  and proves to be a contender for a bestseller!
Now, here is where you guys come in.  I wanted to test the book before starting a crowdfunding campaign, so if you decided to support me, your support  would not be in vain.  You see, I am also a filmmaker, and what I know for sure,  is that every Idea you think of, is not a great one, but Billie proves to be a great contender!  It has received 5 stars across the board and many great reviews.  I am asking for help with promotion and advertising.  For self-published authors, the hardest part is the marketing.  It takes resources, and without those resources a lot of great stories die.   I would like to give this book  a fair shot at becoming a bestseller, and not to be taken out of the game because I lacked the resources needed  to reach a broader audience. 


Get To Know Little Billie.

Billie  is  going through her fair share of it all, a bizarre relationship that would be considered sick in the
minds of most, but even through her naivety, she see’s it as her safest place. And
a mother, while risking her sanity and even own life to save, she is constantly
being endangered and derailed struggling to keep her balance.  By the age of
ten, misguided, lost and abused, she is already on the verge of a breakdown. 


Poverty, drug addiction and dysfunction  within the household  often take center stage as wild cards in her life, and yet she is driven
by a force most do not understand.  She proves that, with strength of will, resilience, and a dedication to her artistic destiny, all things are
possible. She is no ordinary girl.


How Did It Come To Be?




 I wrote this memoir while in the hospital watching my mother fight for her life. After tireless years of trying to make sure she  did not succumb to her extremely hazardous lifestyle, she developed a blood infection and became septic. This type of infection has a 90 % mortality rate. For  the first time, there was nothing I could do to  save her.  It had us in the hospital for 45 brutal days.  Yes, that's right, us.  I never left her side.  I slept in a cot right  next to her. I tossed out the blood tinted urine from the bed pans and emptied the puke buckets.  She's mom, and  just like it had been my entire life,  I was there to look after  her. 
 In order to take her mind off her odds, I began to ask her questions about her  early years with my father.  I loved my father,  and even though he was the monster who terrorized my mother,  he was a very talented singer and  a bit of a celebrity in my hometown. At the time, I thought I wanted to be just like him, but  I was torn, between the Superstar, the Father and the Monster. The Juggler, Juggling admiration, fear and hate.  Everything dropped at fifteen, I learned he wasn't loved by the  neighborhood, he was feared and the hard to swallow reason why. 
I  then began to tell my mother things that I remembered dated back to when I was six years old. She was shocked to hear that I had such vivid memories, of certain horrid events that she was just trying to make light of. 

Writing this book at the time that I did, helped us both.  I believe it kept her alive.   From our 45 days of reflection, for her, came hope.  She prayed that God would spare her life, so she could make up for the lost time with my sister and me. It was actually the first time I heard her pray without it being over food. And for me, it was the revealing of her strength that gave me the strength to finally let go.  To take my hands off her and allow for God to take over. Something that I had prayed for for a long time.

I am so grateful for the positive reviews from the readers. It reconfirms that the decision to publish the intimate details of my life will serve a purpose.

Editorial Reviews


Reviewed by Jack Magnus for Readers' Favorite 
5 Stars!Billie King's non-fiction memoir, Billie, is a ferociously honest and incredibly moving story that gripped me from the very first pages. I found myself staying up later and later as I became reluctant to interrupt her narrative. Billie is beautifully written in a style that makes the reader feel as though he were in the room with the author as she related her life story. Her story never descends into self-pity or moroseness. She remains steadfast throughout, remaining resilient, resourceful and ready to face whatever comes her way.
Reviewed By Gisela Dixon for Readers' Favorite5 Stars!Billie is a raw, compelling memoir and I felt that it was written from a very honest and genuine place: no frills, no embellishments, just plain facts. The fact that all three of them (Billie, her sister Nia, and their mother) struggled with these issues at various levels and are still able to love one another and stay strong and supportive of each other is a wonderful thing.  I applaud Billie for coming out with this memoir.  All in all, a gritty, compelling memoir that is a must-read!

Sandra K Dolberry Read the book. Very well written. Moved swiftly and smooth to every event.May sound like a fiction to some because many instances were somewhat unbelievable, but very true. What makes it more amazing is that the author still stands strong. Knowing first hand that this IS a true story I can't wait to read the fiction.






Powerful, Emotional! The Door and Windows Of Her Soul Are Open. Feel It !

A powerful, emotional true story about coming of age. Wow! Only ten years old and slaying the dragons of hell with one hand and holding her own heart, and her mother's heart in the palm of her other hand. Billie King strives to keep her mental balance, courage, and artistic dreams alive.I wanted to give my shoulder as a place of rest for her head. Some of the pages got wet and I was not cutting onions. I could picture holding onto her hand and walking with her, but both her hands were full of life's daily twist, turns, surprises, tunnels and perplexing predicaments.Between rage and laughter, innocence lost, and tragedy to triumph, Billie King opens her soul with the doors and windows wide open.After reading this true story, I took a look into the windows of my own soul.

The writing is highly detailed and descriptive. During my reading, I felt as though, at times, I was standing there in the room. Sad to know that the things written are true; however, I can feel the strong and powerful being that the author must be to have overcome the events that occurred. I was very afraid reading the ending because I wanted there to be a happy ending. I won't give it away and say how it ends, but I will say...job well done to the author!

Hoffman </b><p>
</p><p><a href=""http://www.daleallenhoffman.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dale Allen Hoffman</a> is a ""civilian scholar"" and mystic.
Non-accredited and non-indoctrinated. Rather than studying biblical and
religious history from within the fences of theological seminaries and
institutions, Dale has chosen to step off the track of religious programming
and instead take a path less traveled. Dale encourages others to stop
""eating the menu being served"" through religious spin-doctoring and
manipulation into an authentic, honest investigation of the ACTUAL history of
The Yeshua Teachings and the Christian philosophy in all of its manifestations.</p>
<p>Though known worldwide for
his decades of study and teachings focused on the Aramaic language attributed
to Jesus, Dale's focus is not simply on words or languages alone, but rather on
the Gnostic experiential core of how to consciously live the world's great
philosophies from the inside out. Dale burns away the veils of religion,
theology, linguistics and mythology with the pure intent of revealing the
direct, transformational flame at the heart of The Yeshua Teachings. Dale is
not a translator as much as he is an activator – a healing voice for awakening,
much like Coleman Barks is for the poetry of Jalal ad-Din Rumi.</p>
<p>Dale offers a living,
breathing vision of the direct, practical application of many of Yeshua’s
(Jesus) most misunderstood teachings from the ancient Aramaic language in which
He spoke them. Dale shares stunning insights from ancient sources including
Aramaic, Greek, Hebrew and Coptic manuscripts about the “miraculous” capacity
of the human mind, our inherent Divinity and the awakening consciousness of
humanity. Dale's work brings forth a direct experience of the profound,
transformational qualities of consciously intoned ancient and indigenous
sounds, tones and languages on activating states of deep Presence and sound
healing.</p>
<p>After 22 years, over a dozen
CD and DVD programs and hundreds of LIVE events across North America, Dale
Allen Hoffman is finally releasing his first book! In “Echoes of an Ancient
Dream: <span>Toning the Aramaic Words
of Yeshua” Dale shares a brief yet compelling look into some of his most profound
and meaningful experiences along his path of looking more deeply into the profound
experiential nature of the ancient Gnostic Aramaic, Greek, Hebrew and Coptic texts
about Yeshua, known in the West as Jesus. </span></p>
<p>In response to by far the most-asked question that Dale in continually
being asked which is “How did you get on to this path?” Dale briefly documents how
he first became intrigued by the tugging intuition in his gut that something
was not quite right about our western view of what is often called “the
inerrant word of God.” Dale shares the shock and confusion that he felt when he
first sat on his grandmother’s floor at the age of seven and compared five
different bibles to each other. </p>
<p>Read about the integral, life-altering experience of Dale’s first
hearing of the ancient Aramaic “Lord’s” prayer of Yeshua and the instant that
Dale realized the immensity of his life’s path. Dale shares how held his mother
in his arms and toned her through her final hours on earth as well as how he
toned his youngest daughter Shemaya in immediately after her birth. </p>
<p>Dale also shares the ever deepening layers of meaning embedded within
the ancient Semitic Aramaic and Hebrew words, root sounds, letter and
teachings. In the last section of the book, Dale shares the millennia-old process
of vocal toning and how to use it as the basis of your daily spiritual
practice. Dale also offers you several ancient Aramaic words attributed to
Yeshua as well as the layers of meaning within them and how to experience the
depth of their inherent vibration from the inside out by toning them.</p>

this came to him. We have talked about it and I still don’t get it. Dale has
this deep understanding of Presence at the time of Jesus like no one that I
have ever met. I have met a number of people that know about that time that
cannot do what Dale can do.</p>

<p>I love this man to the depths

Hoffman 
Dale Allen Hoffman is a ""civilian scholar"" and mystic.
Non-accredited and non-indoctrinated. Rather than studying biblical and
religious history from within the fences of theological seminaries and
institutions, Dale has chosen to step off the track of religious programming
and instead take a path less traveled. Dale encourages others to stop
""eating the menu being served"" through religious spin-doctoring and
manipulation into an authentic, honest investigation of the ACTUAL history of
The Yeshua Teachings and the Christian philosophy in all of its manifestations.
Though known worldwide for
his decades of study and teachings focused on the Aramaic language attributed
to Jesus, Dale's focus is not simply on words or languages alone, but rather on
the Gnostic experiential core of how to consciously live the world's great
philosophies from the inside out. Dale burns away the veils of religion,
theology, linguistics and mythology with the pure intent of revealing the
direct, transformational flame at the heart of The Yeshua Teachings. Dale is
not a translator as much as he is an activator – a healing voice for awakening,
much like Coleman Barks is for the poetry of Jalal ad-Din Rumi.
Dale offers a living,
breathing vision of the direct, practical application of many of Yeshua’s
(Jesus) most misunderstood teachings from the ancient Aramaic language in which
He spoke them. Dale shares stunning insights from ancient sources including
Aramaic, Greek, Hebrew and Coptic manuscripts about the “miraculous” capacity
of the human mind, our inherent Divinity and the awakening consciousness of
humanity. Dale's work brings forth a direct experience of the profound,
transformational qualities of consciously intoned ancient and indigenous
sounds, tones and languages on activating states of deep Presence and sound
healing.
After 22 years, over a dozen
CD and DVD programs and hundreds of LIVE events across North America, Dale
Allen Hoffman is finally releasing his first book! In “Echoes of an Ancient
Dream: Toning the Aramaic Words
of Yeshua” Dale shares a brief yet compelling look into some of his most profound
and meaningful experiences along his path of looking more deeply into the profound
experiential nature of the ancient Gnostic Aramaic, Greek, Hebrew and Coptic texts
about Yeshua, known in the West as Jesus. 
In response to by far the most-asked question that Dale in continually
being asked which is “How did you get on to this path?” Dale briefly documents how
he first became intrigued by the tugging intuition in his gut that something
was not quite right about our western view of what is often called “the
inerrant word of God.” Dale shares the shock and confusion that he felt when he
first sat on his grandmother’s floor at the age of seven and compared five
different bibles to each other. 
Read about the integral, life-altering experience of Dale’s first
hearing of the ancient Aramaic “Lord’s” prayer of Yeshua and the instant that
Dale realized the immensity of his life’s path. Dale shares how held his mother
in his arms and toned her through her final hours on earth as well as how he
toned his youngest daughter Shemaya in immediately after her birth. 
Dale also shares the ever deepening layers of meaning embedded within
the ancient Semitic Aramaic and Hebrew words, root sounds, letter and
teachings. In the last section of the book, Dale shares the millennia-old process
of vocal toning and how to use it as the basis of your daily spiritual
practice. Dale also offers you several ancient Aramaic words attributed to
Yeshua as well as the layers of meaning within them and how to experience the
depth of their inherent vibration from the inside out by toning them.
Stay tuned to this Indiegogo campaign page as we continue to post more
in depth videos from Dale about what he reveals in his long-awaited first book!

Because I’ve been waiting for a book on this subject myself for over a decade. I used to scour the forums and fan sites for information, often finding that a lot of it contradicts other sources or has no official source at all. So I want to settle this once and for all. What first started as an idea to chronicle the first twenty years quickly grew out of proportion. The people I interviewed often said that one decade in itself contained so much information, that the book would be hard to read and handle. The result is the first volume of a series chronicling the history of the division on a per decade basis.<br/><br/>But there is one bump in the process: although I have all the information I need to deliver an interesting read, I also want to offer you an interesting book to look at. I located many of the original show pitches and development artwork, but to feature these in the book, I will have to pay The Walt Disney Company to license the images. Licensing is a quite expensive process that neither the publisher or myself can carry to show the artwork to you.

Because I’ve been waiting for a book on this subject myself for over a decade. I used to scour the forums and fan sites for information, often finding that a lot of it contradicts other sources or has no official source at all. So I want to settle this once and for all. What first started as an idea to chronicle the first twenty years quickly grew out of proportion. The people I interviewed often said that one decade in itself contained so much information, that the book would be hard to read and handle. The result is the first volume of a series chronicling the history of the division on a per decade basis.But there is one bump in the process: although I have all the information I need to deliver an interesting read, I also want to offer you an interesting book to look at. I located many of the original show pitches and development artwork, but to feature these in the book, I will have to pay The Walt Disney Company to license the images. Licensing is a quite expensive process that neither the publisher or myself can carry to show the artwork to you. To break even on the cost of just one image, we would have to sell ten books… and that is not counting the costs to print and distribute the books.The book features information collected from many sources. Let me show you what I'm working with and what information I can offer you in return:Sourcing from a number of private archives, often held by former employees, the resources cover a lot of ground not only in production, but also on the inner workings of the studio, contact with overseas studios, budgets for the productions, invitations for screenings, studio parties and interesting insights of how many ideas changed between the inception of the idea and the completion of the first scripts for a new series.Dig in to the world of animation and learn more about the different stages of animation production, taking a look at pre-production, the overseas animation and post production.

Before I tell you all about the novel, let me assure you:I understand that asking you for your money creates an expectation of success as well as competence.  I have a track record of achieving this success.  In 2012 I used a different crowdfunding site to raise money to release a novel called Physics Incarnate.  It was a complete victory, raising more than enough money to complete the project's goals.I will be asking for a similar dollar value, which incidentally is the minimum that Indiegogo allows people to raise:  $500.  I'm asking for flexible funding (in the event I do not reach $500, I still receive your pledge!) simply because the ""minimum"" amount of work - writing the novel, receiving and employing feedback from beta readers, and procuring cover art - has already been accomplished.  I am not coming to you to create a new product, but to create a far better new product.  My reward tiers, explained in more detail after I tell you about the novel, will ensure that your contribution leads you to an excellent adventure!I hope you will enjoy hearing about what's in store for you, and that you'll consider contributing.  Again, thank you for your time!What Is Protostar: An Automatic Apocalypse?Our protagonist, Lahira Ocean, is the Captain of the Messenger and a stand-out in Humanity's war against The Orphans, which began during Protostar:  Memoirs Of The Messenger.  In the opening chapter, Lahira wakes up from the above-mentioned coma to find two strangers carefully awaiting her recovery.  The first is clearly from the upper echelons of Earth's government who calls himself Herodotus Fork; the second is distantly familiar to Lahira as a woman named Amber, an ambassador from the Automatons, a 'species' of alien who are fully artificial intelligences.Lahira is suspected of being involved in an unprecedented attack on an Automaton:  During the Battle of Gagarin, Lahira's ship emitted a strange signal which seemed to corrupt the mind of an elder Automaton, and Amber has been assigned to levy judgment about what happened.  Unfortunately for her, the chaos of the ensuing melee led to her receiving serious injuries:  She was mentally connected to a computer system which shorted out.  These injuries - along with others lurking deeper under the surface of her thoughts - have induced retrograde amnesia, meaning she cannot fully explain the events leading to her coma.Ultimately, Lahira has to confront her actions during the Battle of Gagarin while recovering from her wounds.  She can't even remember the conflicts she charged into with her top crewmates, and digging into her recent past only brings up more guilt to weigh her down, making the depths of her pain medication's buzz more and more enticing.  She finds herself in theological debates with a machine who has just as much faith in God as any 25th century Human she'd ever met, in ethical arguments with spies over how wars are fought, and in romantic entanglements with those she'd never imagined she'd developed an interest in.By the time the conspiracy unravels, the masterminds responsible for Lahira's turmoil have presented themselves, and Lahira's ship is assigned to guarantee Humanity's innocence in the attack.  Can she establish her species' friendliness to strange alien entities?  Will she survive the latest round of chaos in one piece?Join Lahira by reading Protostar:  An Automatic Apocalypse!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>INTERVIEW</b></p>
<p><b>Is your book simply a retelling of old stories or new information?</b></p>
<p>I reveal new details and stories seldom
heard about characters often seen in Adirondack literature: a retelling
of Sir John Johnson’s Revolutionary War escape to Canada, of which Wanda Burch, retired state
historian of Johnson Hall, said <i>“This is fabulous and the best explanation I
have ever read of John Johnson’s journey from Johnstown.  I love
it!!!""</i>; discovering the locations of Beach and Wood’s cabins; the
roots of a classic Adirondack Guide joke; how Verplanck Colvin fathered two
state parks; Raquette Lake’s role in the origins of forestry science in the US

<p><b>Where do you plan to sell the book?</b></p>
<p>The Adirondack Museum, Raquette Lake
Supply, the Adirondack Reader in Inlet and the Old Forge Hardware bookstore
have already agreed to promote the sale of the book, and we expect other
bookstores to get on board.  Whereas bookstores normally keep 40% of list
price, these bookstores have agreed to take a significantly lower share so that
more of the sale price will go to the Arts Center.</p>
<p><b>Why are you using crowd funding to publish your book?</b></p>
<p>The communities of Raquette Lake and
Blue Mountain Lake are proud of their heritage.  My book reveals the role
this area had in the creation of the Adirondack Park.  My blog has a loyal
dedicated readership that I believe will be eager to buy my book. 
However, it is a small market of readers, which would not attract a traditional
publisher.  Crowd funding will allow me to create the high quality coffee
table book that my readers deserve.  While I cannot self-finance my book,
I also do not seek to profit from it.  Donating all of the proceeds from
my book to the Adirondack Lakes Center for the Arts makes it a service project
for the community.</p>
<p><b>Why is your nonprofit called Birch Point Press, Inc.?</b></p>
<p>The Indian Point peninsula has two
points at the eastern tip.  Birch Point is the name my family gave to the
northern point, where the red, one-room cabin stands today.  I legally
incorporated Birch Point Press, Inc. to receive all of the contributions to
this campaign, manage the design and printing of the book and facilitate the donation of the sales proceeds from the book to the Arts Center.</p>
<p><b>What do you plan to do with the funds you raise?</b></p>
<p>All of the net funds I receive from
this campaign will be used for contracting a professional editor and designer
to create a Print Ready PDF and to produce a short-run offset printing of the
book and an E-book.  My time and financial investment as author in the
creation of the manuscript and this campaign will not be compensated from the
funds.</p>
<p><b>Why did you set a goal of $10,000?</b></p>
<p>If we meet that goal, I will be able to publish a hardcover
book with interior color of the highest quality.  However, I will still be
able to publish a book even if the goal is not reached.  This is a
flexible funding campaign and each dollar raised below goal will still go
toward the design and printing of the book.  Different funding levels will
determine whether the interior pages will be color or black and white, the trim
size of the book, softcover vs. hardback and quantity.  The higher the
amount raised, the greater end quality of the book and/or the volume of books
that can be printed.  The funds will be invested in such a way as to maximize
sales proceeds for the greatest benefit for the Arts Center.  </p>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">WHO is JUHI and WHY did SHE write this BOOK?</span></h3>
<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>I am Juhi, a recent graduate of the University of Tampa.</p>
<p>I am originally from Bombay (Mumbai), India and I came to the United States on the 22nd of August 2015  to start my life as a college student. Fast forward to 5th of May 2018 and I found myself walking across the stage to receive my diploma from the President of my university and I couldn't believe that my undergraduate career had come to an end. In this short amount of time, I had completely transformed who I was as a person and as a student while learning so much about how to also be a professional.</p>
<p>I realised that most of my friends and mentees were struggling not because they did not have the opportunities to do all those things but because they did not know where to start. In fact, I seemed to be their starting point.</p>
<p>That is why I decided to write this book so I could provide potential and current college students with a starting point as to how they can create successful college experiences for themselves. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>When I first started writing this book, I did not realise how expensive publishing a book can really get. Honestly, writing was the easiest part because I did not have to pay anyone to do that. It was all me. But the editing, the typesetting, the designing, the publishing et cetera all costs a lot of money and that is why I need YOUR help to make this happen. </p>
<p>Your funds will go directly towards editing costs of the book, designing i.e. cover design as well as the interior designing (also known as typesetting) of the book. The funds will also go towards the publishing and shipping of the books along with the basic costs for some book launch events. In addition to that, by availing the perks, you are directly contributing to the sales of the book and creating a direct impact in the life of at least one aspiring/current college student. </p>
<p>To make YOU a part of this book, I have offered several perks like giving you a vote (or 100 votes) in choosing the cover design for the book or even including your name in the Acknowledgments section of the book for higher donation amounts. </p>
<p>If I am unable to raise the entire goal for this campaign, the funds will be focused on paying the several individuals who have helped make this happen including my editors and designers. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The big problem I have identified among college students is that we do not want to look for several resources in several places. This book solves that problem by being a one-of-a-kind comprehensive guide to thriving in university and YOU can be a part of solving this major crisis. Just imagine what the world would be like if every student came out of college as someone who had pursued his or her passion, worked on personal development and learned the basics of being a professional! No matter what you do professionally, I am sure you can agree that this would be an awesome world and an awesome cause to create. </p>
<p>As a community builder and organiser, I have worked on several different events that have benefitted my community in Tampa and Oxford and I have a great track record when it comes to resilience and perseverance. </p>
<p>During this journey, I have learnt so many valuable lessons and truly understood the value of money. Like any other entrepreneur working tirelessly towards a goal, I have had my fair share of ramen days and PB&amp;J sandwiches and I am so grateful for those experiences. Someone told me that doing a crowdfunding campaign to help fund the rest of the book was a bad idea but I believe that it shows my commitment and resilience in the face of adversities. I am walking the talk by having the courage to ask for help and be humble enough to accept it while still providing value in return. </p>
<p>By choosing to donate to this campaign today, you can help me accomplish my goal of helping others who are in need. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are no serious challenges to this campaign as of now. I have calculated the costs and meeting this goal or coming close to it will help overcome all of them.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to contribute to the campaign financially, I would love your help with spreading the word for the cause. Please share this campaign with your friends over social media and in person and if you are connected with any educational institutions that you feel may benefit greatly from this book, please connect me with them!</p>

</div></div>","YOU GOT THIS!  is the ultimate guide for the 21st century student. The book is divided into three parts, ""Take Off"", ""In-Flight Navigation"", and ""Landing"" because I believe that your time at university is a journey that leads to the real world. 

 
In the first part, we explore the different aspects of being a successful person. By ensuring that you are taking care of yourself first and focusing on your personal growth and development, you can ensure success in every other aspect of your life. A few of the chapters in this section are-
DISCOVERING YOURSELF AND YOUR ""WHY""
BECOMING A GREAT COMMUNICATOR
TAKING CARE OF YOUR SOUL
 
The second part focuses on your time inside and outside the classroom. By emphasising equally on the academic and social aspects of college life, you will be a well-rounded student and individual who has the best college experience EVER! A few of the chapters in this section are-
ADJUSTING TO YOUR NEW HOME
STAYING SAFE
BEYOND ACADEMICS
 
The third and final part teaches you about the basics of being a 21st century professional. This part gives you access to the best tactics on building professional relationships to help you land your dream job or start your first company, whatever your goal may be. A few of the chapters in this section are-
BUILDING YOUR PERSONAL BRAND
THE 4 ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS
NETWORKING
 
The book also has a special focus on the life of an international student because of my personal experience as one. 
 
WHO is JUHI and WHY did SHE write this BOOK?
Hello!
I am Juhi, a recent graduate of the University of Tampa.
I am originally from Bombay (Mumbai), India and I came to the United States on the 22nd of August 2015  to start my life as a college student. Fast forward to 5th of May 2018 and I found myself walking across the stage to receive my diploma from the President of my university and I couldn't believe that my undergraduate career had come to an end. In this short amount of time, I had completely transformed who I was as a person and as a student while learning so much about how to also be a professional.
I realised that most of my friends and mentees were struggling not because they did not have the opportunities to do all those things but because they did not know where to start. In fact, I seemed to be their starting point.
That is why I decided to write this book so I could provide potential and current college students with a starting point as to how they can create successful college experiences for themselves. 

What We Need & What You Get
When I first started writing this book, I did not realise how expensive publishing a book can really get. Honestly, writing was the easiest part because I did not have to pay anyone to do that. It was all me. But the editing, the typesetting, the designing, the publishing et cetera all costs a lot of money and that is why I need YOUR help to make this happen. 
Your funds will go directly towards editing costs of the book, designing i.e. cover design as well as the interior designing (also known as typesetting) of the book. The funds will also go towards the publishing and shipping of the books along with the basic costs for some book launch events. In addition to that, by availing the perks, you are directly contributing to the sales of the book and creating a direct impact in the life of at least one aspiring/current college student. 
To make YOU a part of this book, I have offered several perks like giving you a vote (or 100 votes) in choosing the cover design for the book or even including your name in the Acknowledgments section of the book for higher donation amounts. 
If I am unable to raise the entire goal for this campaign, the funds will be focused on paying the several individuals who have helped make this happen including my editors and designers. 
 

The Impact
The big problem I have identified among college students is that we do not want to look for several resources in several places. This book solves that problem by being a one-of-a-kind comprehensive guide to thriving in university and YOU can be a part of solving this major crisis. Just imagine what the world would be like if every student came out of college as someone who had pursued his or her passion, worked on personal development and learned the basics of being a professional! No matter what you do professionally, I am sure you can agree that this would be an awesome world and an awesome cause to create. 
As a community builder and organiser, I have worked on several different events that have benefitted my community in Tampa and Oxford and I have a great track record when it comes to resilience and perseverance. 
During this journey, I have learnt so many valuable lessons and truly understood the value of money. Like any other entrepreneur working tirelessly towards a goal, I have had my fair share of ramen days and PB&J sandwiches and I am so grateful for those experiences. Someone told me that doing a crowdfunding campaign to help fund the rest of the book was a bad idea but I believe that it shows my commitment and resilience in the face of adversities. I am walking the talk by having the courage to ask for help and be humble enough to accept it while still providing value in return. 
By choosing to donate to this campaign today, you can help me accomplish my goal of helping others who are in need. 

Risks & Challenges
There are no serious challenges to this campaign as of now. I have calculated the costs and meeting this goal or coming close to it will help overcome all of them.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you are unable to contribute to the campaign financially, I would love your help with spreading the word for the cause. Please share this campaign with your friends over social media and in person and if you are connected with any educational institutions that you feel may benefit greatly from this book, please connect me with them!

<p>Car Designer. Pastor. Agency owner. Marketer. YouTube celebrity. Yes, through this blur of seemingly unrelated past careers I somehow found the ""creative thread"" that ran through them all. In my new book, Creative Threads, I tell the tale of how I went from each career to the next with life lessons, career guidance, and entrepreneurial challenges along the way. It's a small book with a big impact, perfect for anyone who's early on in their career, pursuing something creative, or looking to make a change in their career direction.

<h3>Help Spread the Word</h3>
<p>I wrote the book. I found a publisher. So why a crowdfunding campaign? Because I need help to spread the message. Here's just a sample of the kinds of things I'm looking to do during this launch phase of the book and the Creative Threads brand. </p>
<ul>
<li>Nationwide influencer, press, and media outreach</li>
<li>Promo videos for the book's content</li>
<li>Branding and design needs for in-person events, signings, etc.</li>
<li>AdWords and PPC set up</li>
<li>Launch event support</li>
<li>Advance copies and giveaways</li>
<li>Expansion into related workshop materials</li>
</ul>
<p>And after that? After the Creative Threads launch above I hope to produce:</p>
<ul>
<li>The audiobook version, narrated by either Morgan Freeman or me.</li>
<li>A children's book based on the ""finding your creative thread"" idea</li>
<li>A traveling workshop based on the book called ""Yes, There's More (YTM).""</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What's in it for You?</strong></h3>
<p>Why should you contribute to this project? Because you'll be helping to launch a global movement! But you can also score some killer goodies too– perks like one-on-one career coaching, creative consulting, or even your own workshop. You can also get  some great product perks like autographed books, swag, and access to my video course called Own Your Future. Check them out. </p>

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>I love to create. But I've also got a lot on my plate. So my biggest roadblock right now is simply time... especially time to do the things I like to do the most (video, design, writing).

<h3>How we are different</h3>
<p>Many girl-empowering books exist in the market, educating girls about strong, powerful women in history.

<p>Girls are given an opportunity to:</p>
<p>1. Learn about amazing role models! Girls will be inspired by incredible women and will learn what characteristics helped them achieve their goals.</p>
<p>2. Explore how the attributes of these role models fit into their own story! Girls will have space to cultivate all of those important traits into their own stories. In what ways are THEY just as tenacious and extraordinary in their own life?</p>
<p>3. Plan how all of that awesomeness can be extended into their own community, with lots of little adventures that add up to big change! Girls can begin carrying all of this knowledge and compassion to others in their communities.</p>
<p>How To Be a GIRL! is a long, colorful journey - educating girls on the amazing women who came before them, helping them explore their own powerful place in the world, and helping them find ways of using that knowledge for the benefit of their communities and the world around them!</p>

<p><strong>Julie A. Martin</strong></p>
<p>I have been a children's photographer and portrait artist for over 23 years (beginning with a film camera and pencil in high school, actually!). My work over the last 15 years has focused mostly on girls and really exploring that journey of strength and confidence moving from childhood into adulthood as young women. When my own two girls came into the world (now ages 11 and 13), I became even more determined to raise them knowing their own possibilities, while making sure qualities like compassion and bravery and generosity were part of their childhood. In 2016, my husband, Larry, and I sold everything we owned in Oregon, and began traveling the world with our daughters. Focused on raising them as global citizens, always embracing diversity and not being fearful of the unknown, I have used my photography to connect to young women around the world. Along with my kindred spirit, Kiki, I want to bring that ""globe schooling"" philosophy into the hands of every young girl, to show all young women that differences are wonderful and we are all this together. </p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>By Jove, It’s all about Jupiter!</p>
<p>Why an entire series on Jupiter? Because it’s so big.</p>
<p>Small starts turn into big projects when Jupiter is involved. Jupiter is big, but not very dense. Massive, getting out of control, where is this going, continually expanding vapor—that’s Jupiter.</p>
<p>Of course, the danger with Jupiter is that things can get too big to complete. As the scope and scale keeps expanding, expectations overwhelm, the word count keeps increasing, more ideas, more research, more content, more, more, more.</p>
<p>Can I have a shot of Saturn with that? Bring it back down to earth so I can finish this darn book?</p>
<p>Jupiter’s role is to create the big picture. The Greater Benefic inflates everything it comes in contact with. It’s the role of other planets in the astrological schematic to set limits and add form to Jupiter’s continually-expanding reach. To make sure Jupiter’s balloon doesn’t burst.</p>
<p>According to Claudius Ptolemy in his TETRABIBLOS:</p>
<p>“When Jupiter rules alone he produces increase in general, and, in particular, when the prediction is concerned with men, he makes fame and prosperity, abundance, peaceful existence, the increase of the necessities of life, bodily and spiritual health, and, furthermore, benefits and gifts from rulers, and the increase, greatness, and magnanimity of these latter; and in general he is the cause of happiness. With reference to dumb animals he causes a multitude and abundance of those that are useful to men and the diminution and destruction of the opposite kind. He makes the condition of the air temperate and healthful, windy, moist, and favorable to the growth of what the earth bears; he brings about the fortunate sailing of fleets, the moderate rise of rivers, abundance of crops, and everything similar.”</p>
<p>A good dude to have on your side, eh?</p>
<p>Of course, the operative sentence here, is “When Jupiter rules alone…” And that rarely happens completely. There are seven other planetary bodies, plus the Sun and Moon, that have a say in an individual’s astrological playbook. It’s always nice when they are all lined up in agreement, but that doesn’t happen often either. Life is just not that easy. But even in an imperfect world Jupiter often finds a way to strut his stuff.</p>
<p>Ptolemy composed his treatise on the philosophical constructs of astrology sometime around 150 AD, so we need to cut him some slack on the sexist influences and consider it partly as a product of the times.</p>
<p>Even so, Anthropomorphism is one of the primary characteristics that modern western astrology has inherited from our venerated ancestors, the Greeks, who ostensibly invented horoscopic astrology back in the day.</p>
<p>And Jupiter is distinctly male.</p>
<p>The planet Jupiter was first outed as the home turf of the Mesopotamian God, Marduk, head of the Babylonian pantheon and patron deity of the city of Babylon in the first or second millennium BC.</p>
<p>As Marduk evolved through the years, he adopted the Greek name Zeus, and then became the Roman “King of all the Gods” with the additional moniker, Jove, becoming ever more powerful.</p>
<p>With the advent of Christianity, Jupiter adopted his planet address as his given name and became just Jupiter. He occasionally dons some more contemporary garb and trots around in character. For example, Santa Claus at Christmas time. It’s probably an old habit left over from his days as Zeus. But for our purposes, he goes by Jupiter.</p>
<p>Jupiter adapted, but he never lost his personality or his influence. He is as big a wheeler dealer now as he ever was, and has retained his role as a patron, protector and provider.</p>
<p>In today’s modern world where women have achieved a more prominent social role, Jupiter has adapted again, and bestows his favors in a more even-handed manner. Never the less, Jupiter is still a guy and will occasionally identify with, and grant his biggest favors to, the husband or father in a female’s chart. And in fairness to Jupiter, the reason is partly due to the fact that the Sun in a woman’s chart will often indicate conditions around a primary male in her life, often the husband or father. So, when Jupiter is coordinating efforts with the Sun, it’s not unusual for the male to be featured. However, I suspect that when Jupiter does so, he has her approval and full support.</p>
<p>Now, before you accuse me of being too illogical or silly with all this talk of a planet’s human personification, I would direct you to some additional reading. Try on Carl Jung’s theories of inherited archetypes in the field of psychology. Or Joseph Campbell’s work on the role of mythology in human nature.</p>
<p>Modern science knows what it is allowed to know, according to the rules laid down by the philosophy of Scientism that originated with Sun and Jupiter in Aquarius, Francis Bacon. And this is not necessarily a bad thing. It no doubt serves a good purpose for qualifying research and discovery in the physical world. With the advent of computers and the ability to collect and process massive amounts of data, there is a small-but-growing body of statistical evidence showing many astrological assumptions as having relevance.</p>
<p>However, the mystery and magic of how or why astrology works probably lives in a view of the universe, and our role in it, that is philosophically more aligned with the ideas of the great minds of earlier times.</p>

</div></div>","INTRODUCTION
By Jove, It’s all about Jupiter!
Why an entire series on Jupiter? Because it’s so big.
Small starts turn into big projects when Jupiter is involved. Jupiter is big, but not very dense. Massive, getting out of control, where is this going, continually expanding vapor—that’s Jupiter.
Of course, the danger with Jupiter is that things can get too big to complete. As the scope and scale keeps expanding, expectations overwhelm, the word count keeps increasing, more ideas, more research, more content, more, more, more.
Can I have a shot of Saturn with that? Bring it back down to earth so I can finish this darn book?
Jupiter’s role is to create the big picture. The Greater Benefic inflates everything it comes in contact with. It’s the role of other planets in the astrological schematic to set limits and add form to Jupiter’s continually-expanding reach. To make sure Jupiter’s balloon doesn’t burst.
According to Claudius Ptolemy in his TETRABIBLOS:
“When Jupiter rules alone he produces increase in general, and, in particular, when the prediction is concerned with men, he makes fame and prosperity, abundance, peaceful existence, the increase of the necessities of life, bodily and spiritual health, and, furthermore, benefits and gifts from rulers, and the increase, greatness, and magnanimity of these latter; and in general he is the cause of happiness. With reference to dumb animals he causes a multitude and abundance of those that are useful to men and the diminution and destruction of the opposite kind. He makes the condition of the air temperate and healthful, windy, moist, and favorable to the growth of what the earth bears; he brings about the fortunate sailing of fleets, the moderate rise of rivers, abundance of crops, and everything similar.”
A good dude to have on your side, eh?
Of course, the operative sentence here, is “When Jupiter rules alone…” And that rarely happens completely. There are seven other planetary bodies, plus the Sun and Moon, that have a say in an individual’s astrological playbook. It’s always nice when they are all lined up in agreement, but that doesn’t happen often either. Life is just not that easy. But even in an imperfect world Jupiter often finds a way to strut his stuff.
Ptolemy composed his treatise on the philosophical constructs of astrology sometime around 150 AD, so we need to cut him some slack on the sexist influences and consider it partly as a product of the times.
Even so, Anthropomorphism is one of the primary characteristics that modern western astrology has inherited from our venerated ancestors, the Greeks, who ostensibly invented horoscopic astrology back in the day.
And Jupiter is distinctly male.
The planet Jupiter was first outed as the home turf of the Mesopotamian God, Marduk, head of the Babylonian pantheon and patron deity of the city of Babylon in the first or second millennium BC.
As Marduk evolved through the years, he adopted the Greek name Zeus, and then became the Roman “King of all the Gods” with the additional moniker, Jove, becoming ever more powerful.
With the advent of Christianity, Jupiter adopted his planet address as his given name and became just Jupiter. He occasionally dons some more contemporary garb and trots around in character. For example, Santa Claus at Christmas time. It’s probably an old habit left over from his days as Zeus. But for our purposes, he goes by Jupiter.
Jupiter adapted, but he never lost his personality or his influence. He is as big a wheeler dealer now as he ever was, and has retained his role as a patron, protector and provider.
In today’s modern world where women have achieved a more prominent social role, Jupiter has adapted again, and bestows his favors in a more even-handed manner. Never the less, Jupiter is still a guy and will occasionally identify with, and grant his biggest favors to, the husband or father in a female’s chart. And in fairness to Jupiter, the reason is partly due to the fact that the Sun in a woman’s chart will often indicate conditions around a primary male in her life, often the husband or father. So, when Jupiter is coordinating efforts with the Sun, it’s not unusual for the male to be featured. However, I suspect that when Jupiter does so, he has her approval and full support.
Now, before you accuse me of being too illogical or silly with all this talk of a planet’s human personification, I would direct you to some additional reading. Try on Carl Jung’s theories of inherited archetypes in the field of psychology. Or Joseph Campbell’s work on the role of mythology in human nature.
Modern science knows what it is allowed to know, according to the rules laid down by the philosophy of Scientism that originated with Sun and Jupiter in Aquarius, Francis Bacon. And this is not necessarily a bad thing. It no doubt serves a good purpose for qualifying research and discovery in the physical world. With the advent of computers and the ability to collect and process massive amounts of data, there is a small-but-growing body of statistical evidence showing many astrological assumptions as having relevance.
However, the mystery and magic of how or why astrology works probably lives in a view of the universe, and our role in it, that is philosophically more aligned with the ideas of the great minds of earlier times.
Anyone who has studied astrology in its full context, and has seen it in action, knows that it does work. It just does. There is no explaining it away. So perhaps, with that as starting point and some reverse engineering, maybe someday in the land of physics, scientists will develop some theories of the universe that allow for astrology ... and maybe even a little magic.
When Jupiter is on the hunt for opportunities, big ideas and lucky synchronicities, he most often finds them in areas that are governed by the zodiac sign he occupies. The zodiac sign defines Jupiter’s playbook, dictates his travel plans and drives his sales pitch.
How well Jupiter serves the solar agenda depends on how well the Sun and Jupiter are able to achieve common ground. If Jupiter serves up opportunities that do not suit the ego needs of the Sun, then Jupiter’s efforts may go unnoticed or unfulfilled.
But when that spark of recognition makes a good connection, then it’s off to the races. And if other planetary bodies contribute support, then the possibilities for growth and achievement can be unlimited.
Jupiter’s orbit around the sun takes 11.86 years, approximately one year per Zodiac sign. However, every 398 days the earth overtakes Jupiter and, from the point of view of earth, it causes Jupiter to appear to go backward or retrograde. Jupiter spends about 18 weeks each year in an optical illusion retracing its steps backward through the zodiac.
As an average, Jupiter connects with the Sun by sign for one month every twelve years. The Sun itself spends one month out of each year in every other zodiac sign. So, in a perfectly round solar system, this would connect every Sun sign in the zodiac to one annual Jupiter transit.
But of course, it’s not a perfectly round solar system. And because of Jupiter’s apparent retrograde movement, this can cause it to miss connecting to a Sun sign in one or two  of its 12-year cycles through the zodiac. Therefore, the Sun can occasionally go as long as 24 years missing its connection to Jupiter in a single zodiac sign. It can also occasionally repeat a Sun sign connection two years in a row.
ABOUT THIS RESEARCH:
This study of how Jupiter operates in support of the Sun in the natal chart is composed of 144 combinations. Some combinations seem to cooperate more smoothly than others, but all the combinations have the potential to be successful.
Keep in mind that the meaning of success is in the eye of the beholder. I have used public personalities for this research because they are the most available for study. I have also found that it is helpful to study artists because their creative work often exemplifies the most pure manifestations of the archetypes. But remember that the concept of success is not limited to worldly recognition, or even necessarily to wealth in monetary terms. Jupiter’s success metric should be determined by how well the personality is able to satisfy the ego needs of the Sun sign - not everyone wants to be famous or even rich.

<div><br/></div>
<div>My name is Adam Betley and I'm a young poet/writer(/dreamweaver) from Poland. Recently I've been contacted by a publisher who wants to publish my book. However, due to its experimental nature (more on that below) it's a bit risky, risqué even, so I need to support the project a bit from my own metaphorical pocket.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Naturally, being a young poet/writer from Poland I have no metaphorical pocket. Hell, I'm not even sure I should call myself a young poet/writer, given the fact that I haven't been published yet. But that is also why I can't miss this opportunity. Hence this campaign. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Now, why should you care about a young yadda-yadda from Poland of all places? I've honestly no idea. But in this crazy world where Donald Trump and Hilary Clinton fight for the presidency of the USA, with Kanye West announcing his candidacy for 2020 during the Video Music Awards, while Europe is being flooded by refugees from the Middle East engulfed by war... is it so weird to support a random project on the Internet? It might be, sure. But it also might not be.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Back to the book itself - it's a story about a young man walking around the city. Which is essentially boring. What really matters is the fact that I've decided to combine the prose with the rules - or rather lack thereof - of modern poetry. Thus there are sentences cut in half, random interpunctuation; oh, and there's a dead whale rotting in the centre of the city. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I guess you can see by now why the publisher thinks it's a risky project. Still, they do want to publish the book and I've been trying forever to get noticed. I feel like now's my actual chance. The indiegogo template tells me to ""express the magnitude of what contributors will help you achieve"". I think that ""making my dream come true"" is <i>magnus</i>  enough. And, you know, true. It sounds like a total cliché and I'm surprised myself that I'm using that phrase, but that's the only accurate way of putting this.</div>
<div>I also love unicorns if that helps.</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I need about 1,250 dollars. It all goes to the publisher and then on editing and so on - all those mysterious things that need to happen before a book can be released into the wild.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>If I don't reach the goal, the money will not be wasted on, I don't know, drugs and alcohol. I will keep it and try to get the rest of the funds some other way. After that, I will talk to the publisher again and  then get the book published. It's as simple as that (although it's not simple at all).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>If the campaign is somehow too successful... well, I will be very surprised. Maybe I'll finally learn ballroom dancing? Probably not though, since I ain't got no riddim. So I'll give the money to charity.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Now, as for what you get... I can't offer you the book in question, because it simply might never get published. And if it does, it's going to be in Polish anyway. However, I can offer you a ton of immaterial (nonexistent even) prizes. For example, I can create a mailing list and tell you all once or twice a year that you're beautiful (just like James Blunt would). That's always something, right? </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>So, things like that. See the list of perks for all of them. I can also send you my book of poetry ""cardboard asteroids"" in a form of an ebook. Here's a sample:</div>
<div><br/></div>

<u>a bashful erotic
poem</u></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>her
leg<br/>oh my</p>
<p>***</p>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>And some of the poems are even longer! Hell, I might even write a whole new book feeding off of the endorphins I'll produce if the campaign is successful. I'm also creating a video game, a sort of a visual novel, so that might be a cool thing to get.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Is anyone still using the word ""cool""? Like, seriously.</div>

<div>Each contribution gets me closer to fulfilling a lifelong dream of becoming a published author. It might not change the world, although it might. Maybe my book is exactly what the world needs. Maybe the Earth has been craving my writing. Needing it. Desiring it. Maybe, just maybe by donating to this project you're going to save the world.</div>

As a struggling photographer, travelling to a country halfway around the world requires funds that is at times impossible for me to save up. The PerksAs a backer/contributor, any amount you give is a pledge of support for the cause in which I'm about to embark. Not only will you receive my utmost gratitude, but also some extras that I have added in as a token of my appreciation.$4000 is what I am hoping to raise. Even though this is a huge amount of money, I appreciate every cent contributed and this money will go a long way to helping me achieve a dream to document my journey and have it published into a book.Every cent contributed goes into printing, processing and shipping. Technically, you are paying to have your own set of photos printed.What you will getFor those who wish to contribute but do not have the adequate funds, a small $1 donation will be gratefully accepted as moral support.For a $5 donation, you get to follow me on an almost daily basis via video blogging. Reporting live from whichever location I'm at, I'll be sure to greet you and send you updates on the progress of the trip. Oh, and for sure a view of the location as well!For a $20 donation, you will receive a set of 5 limited edition photo postcards taken from the trip written and signed off by me. Just in case you're curious to know what it might look like: I'm planning to bring a small nifty photo printer with me on the trip so I can print out photos of the locations I've shot and send them to you via mail with my greetings and thoughts penned on them.
For a $50 donation, you will receive a set of 15 limited edition photo postcards taken from the trip written and signed off by me.
For a $100 donation, you will get a 45-minute photography session*, 10 digital photo prints and a 4R framed print. Just in case you're curious as to what a 4R print looks like: 


For a $150 donation, you will get a 45-minute photography session*, 10 digital photo prints and a 6R framed print. 

For a $200 donation, you will get a 45-minute photography session*, 10 digital photo prints and an 8R framed print.
*Photography session available only for those living in Singapore.
Risks Some people would have qualms and concerns over such an undertaking as they would feel that I'm asking donations to go on holiday. The thing is, it is NOT a holiday. Rather, I'm trying out this crowdfunding method and if I do reach my target, then you're looking at seeing a photography book coming soon in your mailbox. If I don't, then I would say it's been a blast and I would use whatever contributions to embark on a local photography project with all the same perks.
In some ways, this is almost a business transaction. We get something off each other. But I take in any wise words and advice you might have, whether or not you choose to support this project.",2.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<div>Over the past one year, I have done an array of interviews with individuals from all walks of live, experts in technology, spiritual teachers, mental health professionals, millennial changemakers doing innovative things, social activists, travelers,artists,  writers, students and more. I have asked them mainly about the following questions: </div>
<div>1. What is a meaningful life to you and describe what your path to finding meaning looks like? </div>
<div>2. What does the phrase ""Art of Being Alive"" mean to you? </div>
<div>3. What makes you feel Alive? </div>
<div>So much life skills, wisdom and profound inspiration from the answers people have given, with their personal stories of turning their pain into purpose, and their journey of finding fulfillment. That is what this book is about. It is a compilation of interviews/ profiles that explores what it means to live a meaningful life,  hint of experts opinion, and my personal contemplation essays with essays from contributors about issues that of great relevance and worth a conversation. </div>
<div>The stories documented in this book are designed to embrace the reader with love, hope and fire to pursue a meaningful life- whatever that looks like for the reader. Also,  to note that each of our stories matter and each of us are here for the full experience of being alive feeling fully alive!</div>
<div>The ART OF BEING ALIVE IS A BOOK THAT IS MEANT TO SERVE THIS GENERATION OF CHANGE-MAKERS AND GAME-CHANGERS WITH AN ACKLNOWLEDGEMENT THAT THEY ARE SEEN IN THE STRIDES THEY ARE MAKING IN LIFE, AND THERE CAN BE A HIGHER SENSE OF PURPOSE AND MEANING IN WHAT EVER THEY DO, AS LONG AS THEY ARE DOING WHAT MAKES THEM COME ALIVE!</div>

<div>Hi, I'm Adedayo. I'm a writer, an advocate for health and wellbeing, and a life artist in my own right. </div>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438804034/oe6upujzwobz3j30para.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Over a year ago, I encountered a <span style=""background-color: initial;"">period in my life when I started asking myself and others the question, ""What makes you feel alive?"" </span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">What prompted this quest to explore how others are living meaningfully, finding purpose and feeling alive; stemmed from me feeling constantly overwhelmed, and being tired of  feeling small, stuck, mediocre and as if I did not matter. I found myself always second guessing the relevance of my voice, if it matters that I write or if my existence even matters! These questions and ponder of life led me to this beautiful journey of creativity  that I am now on. On the days when I did not feel as awake and alive to life as I knew in my soul that I could be, I first took to God to seek comfort and also I took to my pen. I joined an online writers group that encouraged me and served as a support system. We challenged ourselves to write for 30 days straight, which was what I then did. During those 30 days in August of 2014, you could say my heart was full! It was full of inquisitions and contemplation. It was full with wonder and curiosity of life so each day I wrote short essays about life and what I thought was meaningful about it. While the 30days where unwinding, I decided to travel for two weeks and I stayed with my sister who lived in another State. I soaked in the days with so much awareness of self, environment and people. </span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Are there some people feeling the similar ways to how I was feeling? I wondered.  The biggest question that got stuck on my mind, was ""How are others living meaningfully?"" and ""What makes others feel ALIVE?""  As I took my wonder to the world, I truly discovered the need and the gap for people wanting to explore this subject matters. As a result, I have done interviews with individuals from different background exploring the topic and it turns out that people do feel stuck and unsure at certain points in their lives, and that is when they develop this inquisition about their life and the essence or purpose behind why they are here. </span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">My mission is to make to make this subject a relevant subject matter that allows individuals the ability to consciously explore their art of being alive! </span></div>

Over the past one year, I have done an array of interviews with individuals from all walks of live, experts in technology, spiritual teachers, mental health professionals, millennial changemakers doing innovative things, social activists, travelers,artists,  writers, students and more. I have asked them mainly about the following questions: 
1. What is a meaningful life to you and describe what your path to finding meaning looks like? 
2. What does the phrase ""Art of Being Alive"" mean to you? 
3. What makes you feel Alive? 
So much life skills, wisdom and profound inspiration from the answers people have given, with their personal stories of turning their pain into purpose, and their journey of finding fulfillment. That is what this book is about. It is a compilation of interviews/ profiles that explores what it means to live a meaningful life,  hint of experts opinion, and my personal contemplation essays with essays from contributors about issues that of great relevance and worth a conversation. 
The stories documented in this book are designed to embrace the reader with love, hope and fire to pursue a meaningful life- whatever that looks like for the reader. Also,  to note that each of our stories matter and each of us are here for the full experience of being alive feeling fully alive!
The ART OF BEING ALIVE IS A BOOK THAT IS MEANT TO SERVE THIS GENERATION OF CHANGE-MAKERS AND GAME-CHANGERS WITH AN ACKLNOWLEDGEMENT THAT THEY ARE SEEN IN THE STRIDES THEY ARE MAKING IN LIFE, AND THERE CAN BE A HIGHER SENSE OF PURPOSE AND MEANING IN WHAT EVER THEY DO, AS LONG AS THEY ARE DOING WHAT MAKES THEM COME ALIVE!


My Story

Hi, I'm Adedayo. I'm a writer, an advocate for health and wellbeing, and a life artist in my own right. 


Over a year ago, I encountered a period in my life when I started asking myself and others the question, ""What makes you feel alive?"" 



What prompted this quest to explore how others are living meaningfully, finding purpose and feeling alive; stemmed from me feeling constantly overwhelmed, and being tired of  feeling small, stuck, mediocre and as if I did not matter. I found myself always second guessing the relevance of my voice, if it matters that I write or if my existence even matters! These questions and ponder of life led me to this beautiful journey of creativity  that I am now on. On the days when I did not feel as awake and alive to life as I knew in my soul that I could be, I first took to God to seek comfort and also I took to my pen. I joined an online writers group that encouraged me and served as a support system. We challenged ourselves to write for 30 days straight, which was what I then did. During those 30 days in August of 2014, you could say my heart was full! It was full of inquisitions and contemplation. It was full with wonder and curiosity of life so each day I wrote short essays about life and what I thought was meaningful about it. While the 30days where unwinding, I decided to travel for two weeks and I stayed with my sister who lived in another State. I soaked in the days with so much awareness of self, environment and people. 



Are there some people feeling the similar ways to how I was feeling? I wondered.  The biggest question that got stuck on my mind, was ""How are others living meaningfully?"" and ""What makes others feel ALIVE?""  As I took my wonder to the world, I truly discovered the need and the gap for people wanting to explore this subject matters. As a result, I have done interviews with individuals from different background exploring the topic and it turns out that people do feel stuck and unsure at certain points in their lives, and that is when they develop this inquisition about their life and the essence or purpose behind why they are here. 

My mission is to make to make this subject a relevant subject matter that allows individuals the ability to consciously explore their art of being alive! 


""I don't believe people are seeking the meaning of life as much as they looking for the experience of being alive."" -Joseph Campbell


I believe that we are all ARTIST of LIFE; and we are all capable of living a MEANINGFUL LIFE FEELING ALIVE.

By contributing to this project, you will make it possible for this book to be successfully created which will inspire many people to move away from what is holding them back in life and to begin sourcing out their art of being alive. With your contribution, you will be enacting an inspirational and social change movement that will affect millions of individuals especially millennials like myself all over the world to tap into what makes them feel alive, and to seek to live a more meaningful life regardless of what ever background they emerge from. Your contribution will give a strong platform for the stories of others to be heard, and for important conversations that matter to be discussed. 

Howard Thurman said it best, ""Don't ask what the world needs. Ask yourself what makes you come alive and go do that. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.""

Why do I need $9000? 
Writing is free indeed and infact is one of the easiest portion of making a book but publishing a book does cost something. I will be paying the right professionals and experts to work with me on making this book the best it can be so as to ensure that the book can get into the hands of many people as possible. Your contribution to this project goes towards the following estimated production costs: 
* Developmental editing and Copy editing ( $2500) 
* Cover art, book design, illustrations , formating... ($2000)
*Book marketing and publicity & book website ($2700) 
*Campaign shipping and Fulfillment ( $800) 
*Printing Costs for the first run of the book ($1000)
Any extra funds received will go towards building an engaged community of millennial readers who are seeking meaningful ways to feel alive. An online magazine platform that will connect readers from around the world sharing their stories exploring meaningful living and a book tour that will feature in person readings and discussion groups throughout the U.S.
   What You Get

My promise is to update you as the project progresses.


Why Create this book as a Coffee-table Book? 
 Because life is as stressful and hectic as it is already, I don't want to bug you down with another book that feels like work to read. I want this book to be your go to source for inspiration, relaxation, motivation, ideas, thought-provoking conversation starters and your lifestyle companion.The book is set to be designed as a book with beautiful  images, short form writings, essays, profiles, interviews...a glossy design that is an easy read with nuggets of inspiration on every page, a book that you will look forward to pick up in the morning over warm water and lemon, in the afternoon when lounging on your break or in the evening when you decide to practice self care and run yourself a warm bath in the tub. 

Why write this book at all?
One of the quotes that has shaped my entire existence so far is this quote by Mike Murdock that says ""The problem that infuriates you the most is the one God has assigned you to solve."" 
This is what I hope my readers will benefit from picking up this book:

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>'A deep and fascinating tale about where dance can take us. Beautifully illustrated too.'</p>
<p>That's what Mark Walsh, Founder of The Embodied Facilitator Course, says about my book. The book resulted from three weeks of dancing in a total isolation in the darkness as part of an ancient spiritual ritual in India. </p>
<p>With your help, the world can learn about what can happen behind the closed door of a <i>kuti</i>, a special structure that has triple walls to seal you off from the rest of the world. I want to share what I came to know about how three powerful forces of Ayurvedic medicine, solitude and dance - can work together to heal and transform.</p>
<p>Just over ten years ago, I was a research expert and manager at McKinsey &amp; Company, the legendary global management consultancy. Now, I am teaching freedomDANCE, a form of dance meditation and conscious movement. I am not making as much money as I used to, and yet, there is so much I would like to share with the world through my writing, </p>
<p>Please support me. Together we can make the healing power of ancient Indian medicine, meditation and dance become accessible and make a difference!  </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<li>Help me to get the word out and make some noise about my writing on social media.</li>
<li>Tell your friends about my book and my work in general. </li>

</div></div>","Summary
'A deep and fascinating tale about where dance can take us. Beautifully illustrated too.'
That's what Mark Walsh, Founder of The Embodied Facilitator Course, says about my book. The book resulted from three weeks of dancing in a total isolation in the darkness as part of an ancient spiritual ritual in India. 
With your help, the world can learn about what can happen behind the closed door of a kuti, a special structure that has triple walls to seal you off from the rest of the world. I want to share what I came to know about how three powerful forces of Ayurvedic medicine, solitude and dance - can work together to heal and transform.
Just over ten years ago, I was a research expert and manager at McKinsey & Company, the legendary global management consultancy. Now, I am teaching freedomDANCE, a form of dance meditation and conscious movement. I am not making as much money as I used to, and yet, there is so much I would like to share with the world through my writing, 
Please support me. Together we can make the healing power of ancient Indian medicine, meditation and dance become accessible and make a difference!
