<p><b>Who Am I? </b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Oh hi there! My name is Myra Flynn. I'm an indie/soul singer-songwriter and there are three crucial things I've learned about working in music: </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">1.) Being talented is only part of the job. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">2.) Travel, work and record until you think you can't travel, work and record anymore then travel, work and record some more. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">3.) Recognize when your small business has reached a level of success as high as you can possibly reach on your own...then ask those who have supported you to carry it further. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">So: let's try this again. Hi, My name is Myra Flynn. I'm and indie/soul singer-songwriter hailing from Vermont (go figure?) and have been toggling between New York City, my home state and now Los Angeles for nearly ten years now. I recorded an album, made one music video, traveled from state to state on self-made tours, started a private teaching practice, won a couple music awards, started a jewelry line, recorded another album, wrote for Universal Records, made a third album, signed a licensing deal, moved to Australia, moved back to Los Angeles, met my management team, signed with my management team, recorded my fourth body of work and here we are. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I won an award once and the title was ""Myra Flynn: The Hardest Working Woman in Showbiz."" I think at that time I was flattered that my efforts were being recognized, after all: everyone from Vermont works like a farmer. However in these last few years I've learned that it's time to stop looking at my small business as shoveling snow, chopping wood and planting gardens. The garden is in and it's blossomed and thankfully, fruitful. It's time to work smarter not harder and to also recognize that things are in place right now for me to go pretty far in this business. In short, the adverb for my small business has gone from ""what"" to...""how""? </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">That's where you come in: Number 3 on my list of things I've learned. I have been lucky enough to work with a management team of two who also work like farmers, for me! In the last two years since adding Los Angeles to my lexicon they have made it possible for me to: record an album’s worth of music with a multitude of producers including Grammy Award-winning rockstar Jared Lee Gosselin (<a href=""http://www.jaredleegosselin.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.jaredleegosselin.com/</a>) and an all-star team of up and coming producers The Classmatez (<a href=""https://theclassmatez.bandpage.com/)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://theclassmatez.bandpage.com/)</a>   as well as film my second music video to a hit single ""Nobody's Business"" featuring Barbadian reggae superstar Rayvon (<a href=""https://youtu.be/XWJrPzAUzAs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://youtu.be/XWJrPzAUzAs</a>). The coolest part? Most of the people involved in my projects have worked hard to help me out of the goodness of their own hearts and total belief in my rise to stardom. (I can't believe that's a real sentence for me right now?!). I'm just incredibly grateful for the efforts and support they have shown me. So grateful in fact that I want to make sure I ""do right"" by these awesome creations and by that I mean I want to get our music and brand out into the world in a way I never have before. I can't do more of the same, so I need your help getting myself, my small business, my music and my team to The Next Level.</span></p>
<p><b>Where Your Money Is Going</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">My team and I believe we've figured out the best plan of action for our project. If you're wondering...yes, record labels have shown interest. But in reality, record labels are mostly interested in the buzz you have created on your own. And if I decide not to sign and continue to remain independent, well, then at least I've got buzz. :) So what does it take to create a solid underground buzz? Check it out. </span></p>

It will complement the menorah, nativity, and Christmas tree but represent the warmth and hope of all humanity without regard to religion. <b>This interactive light sculpture</b>—conceived and coordinated by the Yale Humanist Community (YHC), a nonprofit organization that is <b>open to everyone and supports an ethical, compassionate approach to life</b>—will represent the goodwill of our community and <b>celebrate the unique diversity of each individual</b> who contributes to making our community so vibrant.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459564638/GL_orange_small_sfnqhb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>YHC has commissioned Edwin “Ted” Salmon to create this <b>symbol of the human spirit in community</b>. This original, interactive sculpture will <b>enhance the luster of the seasonal display on the Green, create a focal point for congregation and connection, and express our commitment to the well-being of the people who inhabit our city, nation and world</b>. Its annual presence will serve as an inclusive, welcoming reminder that<b> when people of all beliefs and backgrounds come together, we can create beauty, light, and warmth</b> during even the coldest and darkest time of the year.</p><p>Salmon’s concept of an obelisk—reminiscent of a lighthouse and adorned with silhouette images representing various facets of community—will stand 15 feet high and be visible from all sides of the Green. As individuals gather near, the<b> light will change and grow warmer</b>. Once enough people surround the sculpture the light will begin to <b>pulse like a heartbeat</b>, reminding us of our shared humanity.</p><p>Perhaps the most exciting part of this sculpture is that <b>it will house a time capsule containing thousands of words of wisdom for humanity contributed by community members</b>. It will be opened in honor of the 500th anniversary of the City of New Haven in the year 2138, connecting community across time. What do you love about the Greater New Haven area, or any part of the world? <b>What wisdom would you want to preserve for future generations? </b>There’s so much in our amazing local and global community that makes life deeply meaningful; <b>what reflection would you share with the community of the future?  </b></p><p><i>Learn more about the time capsule: </i></p><p><i></i></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F163658360&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F163658360&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F567087555_1280.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><i><br/></i><p></p><p>Time capsule contributors are also invited to include optional identifying information, such as a birthdate, so that their future relatives might recognize their message when <b>displayed in 2138</b>.

<p>Approximately 24% of the U.S. population does not identify as religious (Pew Research, 2015). It’s not hard for some to feel disenfranchised from the heart of our community, the town Green, during the holiday season when religious symbolism is so prominent. <b>The Green Light Project offers a respectful, beautiful new tradition to the Greater New Haven community that relates to 100% of our neighbors, friends, co-workers and visitors. Your financial help—<i>anything you can contribute</i>—is crucial to bringing the project to fruition</b>. Please help us bring this illuminating new tradition to the New Haven Green and, through the time capsule,<b><i> join us in offering our collective expressions of hope, warmth, and goodwill to all.</i></b></p>

<p>The Yale Humanist Community is a 501(c)(3) non-profit dedicated to supporting a diverse nonreligious community at Yale and beyond. Many YHC events are open to the public, including Humanist Haven, a bi-monthly gathering featuring a wide array of thought-provoking speakers. Visit <b><a href=""yalehumanists.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""yalehumanists.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">yalehumanists.com</a></b> to learn more. <i>The Yale Humanist Community is an affiliate of the American Humanist Association.</i></p>
<p><b>ABOUT THE ARTIST</b></p>
<p>Edwin “Ted” Salmon has lived and worked throughout the country, and has showcased his work continuously for over 25 years. A sculptor by trade, he educated himself on metal fabrication and eventually opened up his own company <b>EWS3D LLC</b>. Notable works include a piece in Ellison Center for the Arts’ permanent collection in Duxbury, Massachusetts, a large outdoor sculpture for Marriott’s Fairfield Residence Inn in Downtown Brooklyn. Locally, Ted and his team have worked with Geronimo, Shell and Bones and many others. His firm has also done architectural work for Yale, Quinnipiac University, Starbucks and Subway.</p>
<p><b>RISKS</b></p>
<p>The <b>basic sculpture with no interactive lighting</b>, and necessary administrative expenses to support it such as City and Proprietors of the Green coordination,<b> will cost approximately $40,000</b>. If we can’t raise enough money to make that goal, there’s a possibility that the timeline for this project will be pushed back until 2017. This would be extremely unfortunate since we have all the resources in place to make this project happen now. We have many commitments from organizations and individuals around New Haven who support the project’s overall mission of creating universal light and warmth for the entire community.</p>

</div></div>","OVERVIEWEach winter on the Green in New Haven, CT, several religious organizations display holiday symbols. But while many people enjoy their light and beauty, something is missing: A nonreligious symbol celebrating universal human values that can resonate with all people.The Green Light Project will bring a gift of a sculpture to the community, from the community, to be displayed on the Green during the coldest, darkest months of the year. It will complement the menorah, nativity, and Christmas tree but represent the warmth and hope of all humanity without regard to religion. This interactive light sculpture—conceived and coordinated by the Yale Humanist Community (YHC), a nonprofit organization that is open to everyone and supports an ethical, compassionate approach to life—will represent the goodwill of our community and celebrate the unique diversity of each individual who contributes to making our community so vibrant.YHC has commissioned Edwin “Ted” Salmon to create this symbol of the human spirit in community. This original, interactive sculpture will enhance the luster of the seasonal display on the Green, create a focal point for congregation and connection, and express our commitment to the well-being of the people who inhabit our city, nation and world. Its annual presence will serve as an inclusive, welcoming reminder that when people of all beliefs and backgrounds come together, we can create beauty, light, and warmth during even the coldest and darkest time of the year.Salmon’s concept of an obelisk—reminiscent of a lighthouse and adorned with silhouette images representing various facets of community—will stand 15 feet high and be visible from all sides of the Green. As individuals gather near, the light will change and grow warmer. Once enough people surround the sculpture the light will begin to pulse like a heartbeat, reminding us of our shared humanity.Perhaps the most exciting part of this sculpture is that it will house a time capsule containing thousands of words of wisdom for humanity contributed by community members. It will be opened in honor of the 500th anniversary of the City of New Haven in the year 2138, connecting community across time. What do you love about the Greater New Haven area, or any part of the world? What wisdom would you want to preserve for future generations? There’s so much in our amazing local and global community that makes life deeply meaningful; what reflection would you share with the community of the future?  Learn more about the time capsule: Time capsule contributors are also invited to include optional identifying information, such as a birthdate, so that their future relatives might recognize their message when displayed in 2138. These messages will also be sealed and stored electronically in collaboration with the New Haven Museum to ensure their survival.We’ve launched this IndieGOGO campaign to raise the funds to pay for this ambitious work of art. Our backer rewards offer a number of amazing ways to contribute both words of wisdom and objects into the time capsule, as well as many other great perks. We are offering a GLP pin and miniature green lights. Larger rewards include the chance to have your name included on the sculpture with an acknowledgment plaque or, even better, an inscription that will last as long as the sculpture does. You'll even have the opportunity to receive a two-foot replica of the Green Light installation. 


   
Wear your support for the Green Light Project with this exclusive enamel pin. Designed by a New Haven artist, this pin is both a take on the GLP logo and evocative of the New Haven Green, featuring design elements inspired by an aerial view of the Green. And, like the sculpture you're helping us create, this pin will glow in the dark! This pin is included in all perks $50 and up. 

In celebration of our campaign, we’re having a number of events to spread the word. See the list of events below where you can learn more about the Green Light Project in person. 







Approximately 24% of the U.S. population does not identify as religious (Pew Research, 2015). It’s not hard for some to feel disenfranchised from the heart of our community, the town Green, during the holiday season when religious symbolism is so prominent. The Green Light Project offers a respectful, beautiful new tradition to the Greater New Haven community that relates to 100% of our neighbors, friends, co-workers and visitors. Your financial help—anything you can contribute—is crucial to bringing the project to fruition. Please help us bring this illuminating new tradition to the New Haven Green and, through the time capsule, join us in offering our collective expressions of hope, warmth, and goodwill to all.

ABOUT THE SPONSORING ORGANIZATION
The Yale Humanist Community is a 501(c)(3) non-profit dedicated to supporting a diverse nonreligious community at Yale and beyond. Many YHC events are open to the public, including Humanist Haven, a bi-monthly gathering featuring a wide array of thought-provoking speakers. Visit yalehumanists.com to learn more. The Yale Humanist Community is an affiliate of the American Humanist Association.
ABOUT THE ARTIST
Edwin “Ted” Salmon has lived and worked throughout the country, and has showcased his work continuously for over 25 years. A sculptor by trade, he educated himself on metal fabrication and eventually opened up his own company EWS3D LLC. Notable works include a piece in Ellison Center for the Arts’ permanent collection in Duxbury, Massachusetts, a large outdoor sculpture for Marriott’s Fairfield Residence Inn in Downtown Brooklyn. Locally, Ted and his team have worked with Geronimo, Shell and Bones and many others. His firm has also done architectural work for Yale, Quinnipiac University, Starbucks and Subway.
RISKS
The basic sculpture with no interactive lighting, and necessary administrative expenses to support it such as City and Proprietors of the Green coordination, will cost approximately $40,000. If we can’t raise enough money to make that goal, there’s a possibility that the timeline for this project will be pushed back until 2017. This would be extremely unfortunate since we have all the resources in place to make this project happen now. We have many commitments from organizations and individuals around New Haven who support the project’s overall mission of creating universal light and warmth for the entire community.

ouvre la porte à une créativité qui donne libre cours à des

<b>Who are we?<br/><br/></b><p>We
are the <i>Association
for the Preservation of the European Work of Dr. Serge Raynaud de la
Ferrière</i>,
a non-profit organization comprised of volunteers. Since 1981 we have
dedicated our efforts in continuing and disseminating the
humanitarian work and avant-garde thought of De la Ferrière
in the realms of art, science, philosophy and education. </p><br/><p><b>What
is it about?</b></p>
<p></p><p>From
June 11 – 22, 2016, we will be holding various activities in Nice
(France) and Trieste (Italy) in honour of the 100-year anniversary of
the birth of our founder, the French thinkerDr.
Serge Raynaud de la Ferrière. Among the activities that we will be
holding both in France and Italy is the art exhibit: <i>East
and West in the Works of </i><i>Dr.
Serge Raynaud de la Ferrière</i>
where a sample of De
la Ferrière‘s
art works will be presented. The
sociological and anthropological value of the art works from this
thinker who sought to unite the human experience in the evolution of
history as well as the human experience of the different regions and
traditions in the world, gives way to a sense of union and
intercultural rapprochement, based on tolerance by means of
understanding and the study of ancient and modern legacies and
identities within the distinct cultures. He has defined pieces
representing the East and the West, each with its own anthropological
and socio-cultural particularities, promoting a self-cultivation,
education and realization, penetrating into multiple concepts and
symbols of both the past and present.</p>

<p>
</p>
<p></p><p>In
addition, we will be organizing lectures, symposiums and workshops
exploring De la Ferrière’s vision expressed not only in his
paintings but also in his 100 literary works extending to topics in
science, philosophy and education. We will as well be exploring other
avant-garde humanitarian artists, scientists and thinkers.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p><p>We
are currently facing the reality that in the areas in which we are
holding these events, there are not many art and culture subsidies.
We still haven’t reached the amount of money to cover our basic
expenses and we need your help whether it be monetary or even with
your time, in order to organize these events. 
</p><br/>
<p><b>Why
and for what reason do we organize the event?</b></p>
<p></p><p>In
harmony with the activities of the 100-year anniversary of our
founder, we want to organize various activities promoting a greater
and more profound understanding between different peoples, cultures,
ideals, etc. in order to work towards a more tolerant and thus
peaceful society. This is being done in various cities of the
Americas but now we wish to take this to the European countries where
our organization is located (in France and Italy) as a culmination of
our activities.</p>
<p></p><p>Hence,
activities such as the art exhibit<i>
East and West in the Works of Dr. </i><i>Serge
Raynaud de la Ferrière</i>
and the lecture <i>The
Union of Science and Art, a Basis for Tolerance </i>will
work towards these objectives through diverse mediums, whether it be
within the realms of art, science, philosophy or didactics. In
addition, the vanguard and humanitarian thought of other contemporary
artists, scientists and thinkers will be disseminated.</p>

<br/>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>The
effect</b></p>
<p></p><p>The
aforementioned activities will work in favor of a greater tolerance
between different people, cultures, ideals, etc. through a greater
understanding and active cooperation. The exhibits, lectures,
symposiums, children workshops, etc. are both specific and broad in
scope, and have precisely been organized in this way in order to meet
the objectives of an interdisciplinary and intercultural tolerance,
rapprochement and understanding.</p>
<p></p><p>It
is by means of this synthesis and universal approach that the
<i>Association
for the Preservation of the European Work of Dr. Serge Raynaud de la
Ferrière</i>
improves the quality of our societies within the realms of science,
art, philosophy and didactics. We seek to strengthen our cooperation
and social projection with institutions that work in favour of social

<h3><b><h4><b>Project Website: <a href=""http://www.glass-emancipation.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.glass-emancipation.com</a></b></h4>
<br/>Background:   </b></h3>
<p>The title of the exhibition is inspired by an essay titled “Czech Glass in a Context (2006) “written by Dr. Sylva Petrova in which she describes <b>“emancipation from glass”</b> as “one of the most typical features of the Czech glass education and practice” namely in the 80’s and 90’s. In that time, highly educated art students tried to subordinate glass to their art ideas. Thus, they were interested in glass “occasionally” when their projects required transparency, translucency or reflection. I found this term quite fascinating because I studied art in glass-specific curriculums and I felt similar when developing my own artwork. I learned many important things from the experience of working in glass and I did appreciate the depth of the techniques, however, I just did not want to limit my method to a single medium. For instance, I started making glass-like objects out of blown and cast hard candy, and it has become my ongoing series of work until today.  Thus “emancipation from glass” did happen to me, though there is still an apparent connection between the idea of “glass” and many of my non-glass works. And I also found this way of approach among my peer artists who studied in a glass program. Nowadays, “Emancipation from glass” may be observed in different places around the world where artists create works in the crossover fields of studio glass and contemporary art.  </p>
<p><b>It is important to make it clear that my definition of “Emancipation from glass” is not “anti-glass”.</b> It does not bring negative connotations to the medium.  It brings unique perspectives to look at glass, which is different from the conventional perspectives of “glass art”. Here I’d like to quote Dr. Petrova’s words again from our email conversations. “….they (artists who emancipated glass) must be accepted in a rank of glass because they are working with glass in spite in a different way ( in a new role) than others….” “Czech glass scene is quite colorful today. Me as an art historian, however, is still fascinated by the pieces bordering fine art which are very inspiring, very experimental and give the world glass movement very special value.” </p>
<p>Note: <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> “Emancipation from glass” is a departure point </span>for<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> this project, but the concept and selection of the artists in the exhibition are made through my personal interpretation of the term. </span></p>
<h3><b>Participating Artists:</b></h3>
<p>The exhibition includes sculpture, video, and installations by following artists who have very intelligent and experimental approaches to glass.</p>

<h3><b><span>The Exhibition:</span></b></h3>
<p>The exhibition will run from June 9-11, 2016 in Corning, NY coinciding with the upcoming Glass Art Society Conference.  The exhibition venue will be a pop-up gallery utilizing a storefront on Market Street in Downtown Corning. The exact location and further information will be announced on <a href=""http://glass-emancipation.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://glass-emancipation.com/</span></a>  as soon as the venue is finalized… so please stay tuned! </p>
<p>Corning, also known as <a href=""http://www.cmog.org/collection/galleries/crystal-city%20%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">“Crystal City” </a>is a small town but it has a rich history in glass because of the world’s leading glass company, Corning Inc. and the Corning Museum of Glass.</p>
<p>I had previously organized DIY pop-up exhibitions in downtown Corning twice and this will be the third time. In 2009, I co-curated my first experimental glass exhibition titled <a href=""http://howisthisglass.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">“how is this glass?”</a> with a peer artist Anjali Srinivasan. In 2015, I spent 5 weeks in Corning as an artist in residence at the Corning Museum of Glass, and I organized a two-person exhibition""COExist"" with a fellow resident artist, Justin Ginsberg to present the outcomes of the residency program. Both the projects (especially “how is this glass?”, showing works by approx. 30 artists) were labor-intensive but quite rewarding. I have established good connections with the local community, and I am very much looking forward to presenting another project there again. </p>

<h3><b>What I Need Money for:</b></h3>
<p>I am working with the local organizations in Corning to make this project happen. The <a href=""http://www.earts.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ARTS Council of the Southern Finger Lakes</a> and <a href=""http://www.gafferdistrict.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Corning’s Gaffer District</a> are generously offering an exhibition venue and liability insurance coverage. Still, I will be responsible for the remaining expenses that include promotional costs, catalog publication, shipping fee(partial), my traveling and lodging expenses, and miscellaneous costs related to the installation of the artworks.  The details go as follows: </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Catalog printing cost: $650<br/>Miscellaneous installation costs: $200<br/>Partial shipping fee: $500<br/>Promotional costs(signs, posters, partial production cost of the perks): $300<br/>Lodging+food (7 nights in Corning, NY) $350 <br/>Roundtrip airfare (between Tokyo, Japan and Corning, NY) $1500</p>

</div></div>","About me:
I am a visual artist from Tokyo, Japan. I make objects and installations using clear materials such as glass, sugar, light, water and things that shift over time. I am practicing new ways to connect the worlds of studio glass and contemporary art through my own artwork and curatorial projects. I am launching this campaign to seek support for a new group exhibition titled""Emancipation: how to make a work of glass that isn't glass"" which takes place in Corning, NY, USA. To view my full CV, please visit the link HERE.

        






Project Overview:

“Emancipation: how to make a work of glass that isn’t glass” is a curatorial project by Yuka Otani with an attempt to bring new perspectives of bridging the fields of studio glass and contemporary art. The project highlights artworks that derive inspirations from glass but executed without glass, posing questions to the term “glass art” which is often taken too granted today.
Rather than labeling themselves as material-specific art, the exemplified pieces suggest that the possibilities of glass as a creative medium may not only reside in the material itself but also in its metaphorical and conceptual planes. It will take place in Corning, NY coinciding with the upcoming Glass Art Society Conference on June 9-11, 2016.
The full exhibition statement is available from HERE.


Project Website: http://www.glass-emancipation.com
Background:   
The title of the exhibition is inspired by an essay titled “Czech Glass in a Context (2006) “written by Dr. Sylva Petrova in which she describes “emancipation from glass” as “one of the most typical features of the Czech glass education and practice” namely in the 80’s and 90’s. In that time, highly educated art students tried to subordinate glass to their art ideas. Thus, they were interested in glass “occasionally” when their projects required transparency, translucency or reflection. I found this term quite fascinating because I studied art in glass-specific curriculums and I felt similar when developing my own artwork. I learned many important things from the experience of working in glass and I did appreciate the depth of the techniques, however, I just did not want to limit my method to a single medium. For instance, I started making glass-like objects out of blown and cast hard candy, and it has become my ongoing series of work until today.  Thus “emancipation from glass” did happen to me, though there is still an apparent connection between the idea of “glass” and many of my non-glass works. And I also found this way of approach among my peer artists who studied in a glass program. Nowadays, “Emancipation from glass” may be observed in different places around the world where artists create works in the crossover fields of studio glass and contemporary art.  
It is important to make it clear that my definition of “Emancipation from glass” is not “anti-glass”. It does not bring negative connotations to the medium.  It brings unique perspectives to look at glass, which is different from the conventional perspectives of “glass art”. Here I’d like to quote Dr. Petrova’s words again from our email conversations. “….they (artists who emancipated glass) must be accepted in a rank of glass because they are working with glass in spite in a different way ( in a new role) than others….” “Czech glass scene is quite colorful today. Me as an art historian, however, is still fascinated by the pieces bordering fine art which are very inspiring, very experimental and give the world glass movement very special value.” 
Note:  “Emancipation from glass” is a departure point for this project, but the concept and selection of the artists in the exhibition are made through my personal interpretation of the term. 
Participating Artists:
The exhibition includes sculpture, video, and installations by following artists who have very intelligent and experimental approaches to glass.

Susie Hwang(USA) http://www.jsusiehwang.com/Yuka Otani(Japan) http://www.yukaotani.com/
The Exhibition:
The exhibition will run from June 9-11, 2016 in Corning, NY coinciding with the upcoming Glass Art Society Conference.  The exhibition venue will be a pop-up gallery utilizing a storefront on Market Street in Downtown Corning. The exact location and further information will be announced on http://glass-emancipation.com/  as soon as the venue is finalized… so please stay tuned! 
Corning, also known as “Crystal City” is a small town but it has a rich history in glass because of the world’s leading glass company, Corning Inc. and the Corning Museum of Glass.
I had previously organized DIY pop-up exhibitions in downtown Corning twice and this will be the third time. In 2009, I co-curated my first experimental glass exhibition titled “how is this glass?” with a peer artist Anjali Srinivasan. In 2015, I spent 5 weeks in Corning as an artist in residence at the Corning Museum of Glass, and I organized a two-person exhibition""COExist"" with a fellow resident artist, Justin Ginsberg to present the outcomes of the residency program. Both the projects (especially “how is this glass?”, showing works by approx. 30 artists) were labor-intensive but quite rewarding. I have established good connections with the local community, and I am very much looking forward to presenting another project there again.

What I Need Money for:
I am working with the local organizations in Corning to make this project happen. The ARTS Council of the Southern Finger Lakes and Corning’s Gaffer District are generously offering an exhibition venue and liability insurance coverage. Still, I will be responsible for the remaining expenses that include promotional costs, catalog publication, shipping fee(partial), my traveling and lodging expenses, and miscellaneous costs related to the installation of the artworks.  The details go as follows: 


Catalog printing cost: $650Miscellaneous installation costs: $200Partial shipping fee: $500Promotional costs(signs, posters, partial production cost of the perks): $300Lodging+food (7 nights in Corning, NY) $350 Roundtrip airfare (between Tokyo, Japan and Corning, NY) $1500
The total cost estimate is $3500. If the campaign achieves beyond the goal, any additional contributions go towards upgrading catalog design, work shipping fee and my personal travel expenses. If the campaign does not reach the goal, the exhibition will still happen. All the money raised will be invested to the exhibition cost and I will be paying the rest out of my pocket.

</h1><h2><b>#5KRiels: For the Life of Cambodian Shadow Puppet?</b></h2>
<p>5000 Riels (1.25 dollars) for the life of Cambodian Shadow
Puppet, basically know as Sbek Thom in Cambodian language, is projected with
the purposes of preserving, enhancing the quality and most importantly
inspiring the younger generation about the Sbek Thom Theater.</p>
<p>5000 Riels for Sbek Thom was born right after we had heard
the saddest news that Mr. Mann Kosal, known as master of L’khon Sbek and the
founder of Sovannaphum Arts Association planned to change his career from the
theater director to the Tuk-Tuk driver and settled his life in one province in
Cambodia. Our hearts dropped knowing this announcement from one of our team as
we highly respect his talents, commitments and sacrifices through years to come
to this point, and most importantly, as Cambodians, we could not let this world
art heritage – Puppet Shadow Theater die and leave nothing for the next
generation. </p>
<p>The theater is performed every Friday and Saturday at the
association; the number of both local and international audiences decrease from
one week to another because of the lack of human resource in operating,
managing and marketing both performances and the association. With no supports
from neither government, public nor any NGOs, Master Kosal have been struggling
years and years in balancing the income and expenses until these recent days
that he was totally hopeless in carry on his dream. </p>
<p>The only inspiration holding on him to go through all
obstacles over years is to see the next generation knows and loves Sbek Thom
Theater and to make sure that it is well preserved. Fight alone, he will not be
able to accomplish, but fight together will do. </p>
<p>Without
Sovannaphum theatre, there will be no Sbek Thom. As Sbek Thom now is in crisis,
only people like you will help us to achieve this goal by sustain this
performance art into life. </p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FDp-eczxZ2Q4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DDp-eczxZ2Q4&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FDp-eczxZ2Q4%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<h2><b>What is the
problem?</b></h2>
<p>Click here: <a href=""http://www.phnompenhpost.com/post-weekend/even-master-craftsmen-need-pay-rent"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">News on Phnom Penh Post Newspaper: Even master craftsmen need to pay the rent</a></p><p>Founded in 1994 in Phnom Penh, Sovanna Phum Art Association was
established by Master Mann Kosal to revive Sbek Thom shadow puppetry, an art
form lost during the Khmer Rouge regime. Since then, the association has stayed
true to his vision by being a platform for young Cambodians to reinstate their
cultural heritages and express themselves through art.</p>
<p>Over the past 22 years since he first picked up the skills of
performance and puppet making from Masters Pech Tom Krovil, Cheng Phon and Prin
Sakhorn, Master Kosal has devoted himself to the improvement of Khmer shadow
puppetry. Beyond the revival of Sbek Thom, in itself an intangible heritage,
Master Kosal is also central to the advancement of puppetry and ways of keeping
Sbek Thom relevant to a modernising Cambodia. Despite the humble beginnings of
Sovanna Phum, when Master Kosal began telling stories with only four large
shadow puppets, he never stopped making more and better puppets to share even
more sophisticated legends and empowering tales. Recently inspired by Kelantan
puppetry, he seeks to create large colored shadows to tell the story of the
beginnings of Hanuman, an episode less common due to its lack of action and
movements.</p><p>Click here: <a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/yuyefzDNLdL2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">360degree picture of Sovannaphum theatre and stage</a></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The impact of Sovanna Phum has helped sustain and develop
recognition of the once lost art form to this day. For its first ten years,
Sbek Thom and Master Kosal’s intriguing performances drew more than 100 artists
to the association with approximately 100 audiences a day. Till today, Master
Kosal also grooms street children or relatives of his artists with food,
shelter, and even money for education so those interested in the arts may pick
up more knowledge and practice with the association. Master Kosal also
conscientiously wrote stories and directed performances to educate the wider
public on knowledge of such issues as environmental cleanliness and safe sex.
Thus both artists and the community benefitted from Master Kosal and the
Sovanna Phum Art Association through their art and community engagement.</span><br/></p>
<p>Unfortunately since the mid-2000’s, the economy and demand
for space in Phnom Penh changed dramatically. Master Kosal’s founding partner
and manager left the association for personal reasons, and the association had
to change its venue to reduce rental costs. Unfortunately their move has not
boded well for its outreach, and without opportunities for arts management
training and employment, the association’s artists have since dwindled to 10,
with insufficient income for Master Kosal himself and the association’s
volunteer managers and their increasing health costs. With artists now only
receiving 5 USD per performance in spite of rising costs, artist retention and
hours for rehearsals have been on the decline. This has gone to the extent that
the Phnom Penh Post interviewed and reported on 10<sup>th</sup> June 2016 of
Master Kosal’s plan for a career change.</p><p>Click Here: <a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/VRhnmR4MbQ42"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">360 degree picture of Sovannaphum performance and behind the white screen</a><br/></p>
<p>This situation is symptomatic of a recovering country now
mined for its land and resources whose people have yet and cannot catch up to
the new economy. Rental is rising at approximately 7-15% a year, even though no
free or accessible opportunities for skill development or education exists.
Government officials and NGOs themselves are steered by the incoming
investments of East Asia with insufficient support for craftsmen and other
industries such as Mann Kosal. Artists clamor for funding and job opportunities
with insufficient time and foresight to foster development among other artists.
Few craftsmen and artists can afford to speak English and French. Not enough
information therefore reaches the international aid organisations for an
effective countrywide support of the Khmer arts. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469048300/K1_gkhepk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469048552/K-now_wqgun4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Master Kosal is no stranger to international ideas and
exchange, and could have been a world-renowned artist if not for the impacts of
the Cold War, the Khmer Rouge and the lack of effective humanitarian aid in
South East Asia. To date, he has travelled to a total of 45 countries presenting
his innovate skills and high quality work. Concomitantly, Master Kosal has
brought Sbek Thom in its most original form to these many countries, even
introducing it to such esteemed persons as Princess Diana, which now sits
alongside other intangible practices classified as an UNESCO World Heritage.
Given his unyielding determination and enduring love for the art, he is one of
the only Sbek Thom masters left in Cambodia today. Uniquely, Kosal also
believes in imparting all of his knowledge to his disciples, unlike those
before him. Given the resources, he would seek all manner of research,
development and education of Khmer stories, art and performance.</p><p><br/></p>
<h2><b>What We Hope</b></h2>
<p>Our goal
is to raise between 12,000 to 30,000 USD to keep the association running for 6
more months. This is to meet its basic needs, estimated at 5,000 USD per month,
and develop Sovanna Phum’s arts management, artist recruitment and marketing
for its long term sustainability. </p>
<p>The
group hopes to revive Sovanna Phum’s educational shows and provide a
development plan for the association’s artists, especially Master Kosal, to
prevent the effacement of this rich part of Khmer culture.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FfscLp4hLuTU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DfscLp4hLuTU&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FfscLp4hLuTU%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p><br/></p><h2><b>The Impact</b></h2>
<p>We are creating a movement
in order to save Large Shadow Puppetry. Large Shadow Puppetry has been included
as a national heritage in the 25th November 2005. Despite various kinds of
promoting , the Large Shadow Puppetry gradually be forgotten and the lack of
care of this defamation legacy that makes the market of Large Shadow Puppetry
lost almost no known today. </p>
<p>That is why we created this
project to preserve and develop Large Shadow Puppetry stability to share to the
younger generation to learn about their national culture and we also want to
show to the international guests to recognize this marvelous Khmer art as well.</p>
<p>These
outreach programmes wold also help develop future audiences and Cambodian
society at large, especially its youths, so they mat have and be part of an
intangible world heritage, for greater pride and understanding of what it means
to be Khmer.</p><p><br/></p>
<h2><b>The Team</b></h2>
<p>This initiation came from a group of young Cambodian youths,
Plerng Kob who passionately interest in arts, especially this form of theater is trying our best with the help of UNIMA
Singapore to preserve this cultural art, because it is our national symbol to
the world. </p>
<h4>
<b>1.  </b><b>Plerng Kob</b>
</h4>
<p>Plerng kob is a non-profit organization by students on the mission
to bring life back to the old art forms of Cambodia by creating cultural art
events, such as the annual folk-festival called “Bonn Phum”, literally means
“Village festival” in pagodas in Cambodia, as a means of saving the arts and
cultural events, in particular “Sbek Thom” (Shadow puppetry) to Cambodian young
generation and Cambodian as a whole.</p>
<p>This year Plerng Kob is making efforts to preserve and develop
Sbek Thom, which was listed as the intangible cultural heritage of humanity by
the UNESCO. As the young generation who has a great passion of art, we cannot
stand and see our art disappear without having a proper solutions. That is why
we are here to help sustain and give back the performance art that is a symbol
of national heritage to the next generation. </p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FDHCNRW2px7Q%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DDHCNRW2px7Q&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FDHCNRW2px7Q%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Frg1g1fFzqgA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Drg1g1fFzqgA&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Frg1g1fFzqgA%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p><br/></p>
<h4>
<b>2. 
</b><b>UNIMA-Singapore</b>
</h4>
<p>Singapore's national centre for the international puppetry
association, UNIMA-Singapore is focused on developing the puppet arts of
Singapore and its region of Southeast Asia.</p>
<p><br/>
</p><h2><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></h2><p>
These are the facts that we're focused on improving and repair the structure of
the association by having additional staffs to work on permanent and specific
sections to make it easier to solve problems that are encountered as described
above. Moreover, increasing the ability to perform is needed to attract the
attention of viewers but we need funding assistance to them for regular
rehearsals. The tools and performance equipment also needs further improvement.
Especially, the promotion of Large Shadow Puppetry main job is to provide specific
information about the schedule of the performances to the audience.</p>
<p>With such a problem has
occurred, coupled with a large number of issues, such as:</p>
<p>1: There is no proper
management structure in the association (no employees working full time for the
association because of the lost income and couldn't afford to provide decent
wages for employees and long-lasting).</p>
<p>2: There is no manager in
media and advertisement and marketing, which is not ideal that cause reduction
to national and international audiences to even fewer and fewer.</p>
<p>3: Lack of financial strength
to maintain and stabilize the core of association.</p>
<p>4: Lack of new art forms (the
majority of artists in the association couldn't stay for long because they can
not survive without income so artists who come to learn or want to continue
performing become less and less and can't stay longer, which means that artists
who performed at the association are not permanent.</p><p><br/></p>

the saddest news that Mr. Mann Kosal, known as master of L’khon Sbek and the
founder of Sovannaphum Arts Association planned to change his career from the
theater director to the Tuk-Tuk driver and settled his life in one province in
Cambodia. Our hearts dropped knowing this announcement from one of our team as
we highly respect his talents, commitments and sacrifices through years to come
to this point, and most importantly, as Cambodians, we could not let this world
art heritage – Puppet Shadow Theater die and leave nothing for the next
generation. 
The theater is performed every Friday and Saturday at the
association; the number of both local and international audiences decrease from
one week to another because of the lack of human resource in operating,
managing and marketing both performances and the association. With no supports
from neither government, public nor any NGOs, Master Kosal have been struggling
years and years in balancing the income and expenses until these recent days
that he was totally hopeless in carry on his dream. 
The only inspiration holding on him to go through all
obstacles over years is to see the next generation knows and loves Sbek Thom
Theater and to make sure that it is well preserved. Fight alone, he will not be
able to accomplish, but fight together will do. 
Without
Sovannaphum theatre, there will be no Sbek Thom. As Sbek Thom now is in crisis,
only people like you will help us to achieve this goal by sustain this
performance art into life. 
What is the
problem?
Click here: News on Phnom Penh Post Newspaper: Even master craftsmen need to pay the rentFounded in 1994 in Phnom Penh, Sovanna Phum Art Association was
established by Master Mann Kosal to revive Sbek Thom shadow puppetry, an art
form lost during the Khmer Rouge regime. Since then, the association has stayed
true to his vision by being a platform for young Cambodians to reinstate their
cultural heritages and express themselves through art.
Over the past 22 years since he first picked up the skills of
performance and puppet making from Masters Pech Tom Krovil, Cheng Phon and Prin
Sakhorn, Master Kosal has devoted himself to the improvement of Khmer shadow
puppetry. Beyond the revival of Sbek Thom, in itself an intangible heritage,
Master Kosal is also central to the advancement of puppetry and ways of keeping
Sbek Thom relevant to a modernising Cambodia. Despite the humble beginnings of
Sovanna Phum, when Master Kosal began telling stories with only four large
shadow puppets, he never stopped making more and better puppets to share even
more sophisticated legends and empowering tales. Recently inspired by Kelantan
puppetry, he seeks to create large colored shadows to tell the story of the
beginnings of Hanuman, an episode less common due to its lack of action and
movements.Click here: 360degree picture of Sovannaphum theatre and stage
The impact of Sovanna Phum has helped sustain and develop
recognition of the once lost art form to this day. For its first ten years,
Sbek Thom and Master Kosal’s intriguing performances drew more than 100 artists
to the association with approximately 100 audiences a day. Till today, Master
Kosal also grooms street children or relatives of his artists with food,
shelter, and even money for education so those interested in the arts may pick
up more knowledge and practice with the association. Master Kosal also
conscientiously wrote stories and directed performances to educate the wider
public on knowledge of such issues as environmental cleanliness and safe sex.
Thus both artists and the community benefitted from Master Kosal and the
Sovanna Phum Art Association through their art and community engagement.
Unfortunately since the mid-2000’s, the economy and demand
for space in Phnom Penh changed dramatically. Master Kosal’s founding partner
and manager left the association for personal reasons, and the association had
to change its venue to reduce rental costs. Unfortunately their move has not
boded well for its outreach, and without opportunities for arts management
training and employment, the association’s artists have since dwindled to 10,
with insufficient income for Master Kosal himself and the association’s
volunteer managers and their increasing health costs. With artists now only
receiving 5 USD per performance in spite of rising costs, artist retention and
hours for rehearsals have been on the decline. This has gone to the extent that
the Phnom Penh Post interviewed and reported on 10th June 2016 of
Master Kosal’s plan for a career change.Click Here: 360 degree picture of Sovannaphum performance and behind the white screen
This situation is symptomatic of a recovering country now
mined for its land and resources whose people have yet and cannot catch up to
the new economy. Rental is rising at approximately 7-15% a year, even though no
free or accessible opportunities for skill development or education exists.
Government officials and NGOs themselves are steered by the incoming
investments of East Asia with insufficient support for craftsmen and other
industries such as Mann Kosal. Artists clamor for funding and job opportunities
with insufficient time and foresight to foster development among other artists.
Few craftsmen and artists can afford to speak English and French. Not enough
information therefore reaches the international aid organisations for an
effective countrywide support of the Khmer arts. 
Master Kosal is no stranger to international ideas and
exchange, and could have been a world-renowned artist if not for the impacts of
the Cold War, the Khmer Rouge and the lack of effective humanitarian aid in
South East Asia. To date, he has travelled to a total of 45 countries presenting
his innovate skills and high quality work. Concomitantly, Master Kosal has
brought Sbek Thom in its most original form to these many countries, even
introducing it to such esteemed persons as Princess Diana, which now sits
alongside other intangible practices classified as an UNESCO World Heritage.
Given his unyielding determination and enduring love for the art, he is one of
the only Sbek Thom masters left in Cambodia today. Uniquely, Kosal also
believes in imparting all of his knowledge to his disciples, unlike those
before him. Given the resources, he would seek all manner of research,
development and education of Khmer stories, art and performance.
What We Hope
Our goal
is to raise between 12,000 to 30,000 USD to keep the association running for 6
more months. This is to meet its basic needs, estimated at 5,000 USD per month,
and develop Sovanna Phum’s arts management, artist recruitment and marketing
for its long term sustainability. 
The
group hopes to revive Sovanna Phum’s educational shows and provide a
development plan for the association’s artists, especially Master Kosal, to
prevent the effacement of this rich part of Khmer culture.The Impact
We are creating a movement
in order to save Large Shadow Puppetry. Large Shadow Puppetry has been included
as a national heritage in the 25th November 2005. Despite various kinds of
promoting , the Large Shadow Puppetry gradually be forgotten and the lack of
care of this defamation legacy that makes the market of Large Shadow Puppetry
lost almost no known today. 
That is why we created this
project to preserve and develop Large Shadow Puppetry stability to share to the
younger generation to learn about their national culture and we also want to
show to the international guests to recognize this marvelous Khmer art as well.
These
outreach programmes wold also help develop future audiences and Cambodian
society at large, especially its youths, so they mat have and be part of an
intangible world heritage, for greater pride and understanding of what it means
to be Khmer.
The Team
This initiation came from a group of young Cambodian youths,
Plerng Kob who passionately interest in arts, especially this form of theater is trying our best with the help of UNIMA
Singapore to preserve this cultural art, because it is our national symbol to
the world. 

1.  Plerng Kob

Plerng kob is a non-profit organization by students on the mission
to bring life back to the old art forms of Cambodia by creating cultural art
events, such as the annual folk-festival called “Bonn Phum”, literally means
“Village festival” in pagodas in Cambodia, as a means of saving the arts and
cultural events, in particular “Sbek Thom” (Shadow puppetry) to Cambodian young
generation and Cambodian as a whole.
This year Plerng Kob is making efforts to preserve and develop
Sbek Thom, which was listed as the intangible cultural heritage of humanity by
the UNESCO. As the young generation who has a great passion of art, we cannot
stand and see our art disappear without having a proper solutions. That is why
we are here to help sustain and give back the performance art that is a symbol
of national heritage to the next generation. 

2. 
UNIMA-Singapore

Singapore's national centre for the international puppetry
association, UNIMA-Singapore is focused on developing the puppet arts of
Singapore and its region of Southeast Asia.

Risks & Challenges
These are the facts that we're focused on improving and repair the structure of
the association by having additional staffs to work on permanent and specific
sections to make it easier to solve problems that are encountered as described
above. Moreover, increasing the ability to perform is needed to attract the
attention of viewers but we need funding assistance to them for regular
rehearsals. The tools and performance equipment also needs further improvement.
Especially, the promotion of Large Shadow Puppetry main job is to provide specific
information about the schedule of the performances to the audience.
With such a problem has
occurred, coupled with a large number of issues, such as:
1: There is no proper
management structure in the association (no employees working full time for the
association because of the lost income and couldn't afford to provide decent
wages for employees and long-lasting).
2: There is no manager in
media and advertisement and marketing, which is not ideal that cause reduction
to national and international audiences to even fewer and fewer.
3: Lack of financial strength
to maintain and stabilize the core of association.
4: Lack of new art forms (the
majority of artists in the association couldn't stay for long because they can
not survive without income so artists who come to learn or want to continue
performing become less and less and can't stay longer, which means that artists
who performed at the association are not permanent.

</div></div>","Hi there! We are four artists from Paphos Cyprus, which is here:


The Kimonos Art Center is a project we started dreaming of a while ago. The idea is, no more, no less, to create an art school in a place where it is much needed.
But first of all, let's meet the crew: 
 
With a little bit of luck, lots of patience and plenty of good will we started working this summer, renovating the old house of Charalambos' grandparents to transform it to a fully equipped art studio where we could work, teach, give lectures, invite people for workshops, create a residency program for art students and artists from abroad... and to have a nice place to sit back and drink coffee and beer during the nice warm Cyprus evenings.
In the Kimonos Art Center we will have studios for drawing, painting, printmaking, photography, DSLR filmmaking, animated filmmaking, video art and cementography (a Cypriot technique that we currently are the only place on earth to teach). 
All four of us combined can do great stuff.

For more details you can visit our website at kimonosartcenter.com. That's the one Sylvia created and it's awesome. 
What we need  from you is, of course, the money to do so.
What has been already done (and needs to be paid for): 
We have scrubbed, cleaned, repaired and painted all the walls, doors and windows of the house. We have demolished two walls to create two large spaces, one for the painting and drawing studio and one for the photography, video art, and DSLR filmmaking studio, which will be used at the same time as a library. We have replaced and fixed the electrical installation and the plumbing. We have moved all of our separate stuff in the house. And landscaped the garden. 

What needs to be done:
We need to renovate the auxiliary building behind the house which will be transformed into a guesthouse, in order to be able to welcome visitors for the residency program. This includes replacing doors and windows, repairing the plumbing, fixing the electrical installation, making a roof (!) for our kitchen, buying the furniture and the electrical appliances.

<p><b>*********************** THE PROJECT ************************</b></p>
<p><b><i>The City of Lost Angels</i> memorial &amp; <i>What’s Working is Broken</i>
album are currently touring as a multi-media installation that is being seen in
galleries, schools and street corners across the country, engaging other
artists, organizers and community members along the way.  </b><b>Funding this project will
allow us to bring the
installation to more cities, </b><b>complete this powerful album and
continue documenting personal testimonials of those impacted by police violence
and the system.  </b></p>
<p><b><i>CITY OF LOST ANGELS</i> </b>is a memorial to loved ones who have been
killed by police or street violence, and those that have been lost through
incarceration and deportation.  Over the past 10 years, Kim McGill, an
organizer with the Youth Justice Coalition (YJC), has worked with young people
in juvenile halls, youth prisons, high schools and community centers to create
these memorial plaques.  </p>
<p><b><i>WHAT’S WORKING IS BROKEN</i></b> is an album composed by Veronique
d’Entremont of recordings made during YJC protests and organizing against LAPD
violence, and personal testimonials of police abuse.  It is an audio experience that integrates
personal stories, radio journalism and music. 
YJC youth leaders Malik Brock, Ronnie Dunmore and Jose Gallegos have
joined this project to work on new tracks and bring it to the streets as a tool
to engage people in conversation and action to expose and end police
violence.  </p>
<p><b>Together we are using this project to educate, inspire action, build connections
and promote understanding between communities, and to support the Youth Justice
Coalition's organizing led by youth and communities most impacted by police
violence, including the families of more than 630 people killed by law
enforcement in LA County since 2000.</b></p><p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>************ This project has EXPANDED and continues to grow ************</b></p><p><b><br/></b></p>
<p>We’re still working on NEW TRACKS for the final album, but current tracks
are available to listen to at <a href=""http://www.whatsworkingisbroken.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.whatsworkingisbroken.com</a> 
</p>
<p><b>ALBUM</b>: We want this album to
sound as powerful as the stories contained in it, and for the booklet to be
informative and beautiful.  $2000 to get the album mastered and to print
500 copies of the CD and artist booklet.  </p>
<p><b>MEMORIAL</b>: The memorial is composed of over one-hundred handmade paper
“tiles” that are arranged like bricks on a wall.  We want to scan these,
print them on canvas and sew them into a large quilt/tapestry.  This
version can be hung easily for street installations and we won’t have to risk
damaging the original memorial. Sadly, people across this country continue to
lose their lives to violence on the street, by the police, and through the
system.  Additional canvas memorial squares can be created by community
members and added to in every city. This will cost us about $1500 in printing
and materials.  </p>
<p><b>RECORDING: </b>An important part of this project has been documenting the
personal testimonials of people who have experienced police violence. 
Traveling to other cities with the memorial had granted us the opportunity to
learn more about current and past incidents of police terror.  In
Baltimore, we heard from many residents that the police have refused to respond
to 911 calls since the murder of Freddie Gray, and subsequent uprising. 
In West Philadelphia, we met residents whose homes were destroyed in the 1985
police firebombing of the MOVE headquarters, and heard about the city's
attempts to erase this history.  These are stories that are not being told
in the mainstream media, and we hope to continue documenting them to bring them
to light.</p>
<p>If we don’t meet our goal, we’ll scale back number of CD’s we’re printing,
the length of the artist booklet and the number of memorial “tiles” we’re
having printed on canvass.  However we believe that with the support of
politically and artistically like-minded folks, we can far surpass our goal.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>************************ THE IMPACT ************************</b></p>
<p><b><i>The City of Lost Angels</i>
memorial </b>was installed in Los Angeles for the first time in 2014, through a
collaboration between Kim McGill, Veronique d’Entremont and Aloni Bonilla and
since has been installed in galleries, schools and street corners with <b><i>What’s
Working is Broken</i></b> to create a powerful audio-visual experience that
engages viewers and people passing by. When we install on the street, this
creates an opportunity for dialogue, healing and also an opportunity to
document additional testimonials of police violence and harassment from people
who stop to engage with the memorial. </p>
<p>The <b>Youth Justice Coalition (YJC) </b>is working to build a youth, family
and prisoner-led movement to challenge Los Angeles’ California’s and the
nation’s addiction to incarceration, and race, gender and class inequality
throughout the juvenile and criminal <i>in</i>justice systems. We mobilize
youth inside lock-ups, in continuation, Probation and under-resourced schools,
and on the street.  Through transformative justice and community
intervention/peacebuilding, direct action organizing, advocacy, political education,
and activist arts, YJC works to expose and pressure the people in charge, in
order to upset power and bring about change.  In 2007, the YJC founded
FREE L.A. School, to eliminate barriers for system involved youth who have been
pushed out of LAUSD schools.  Both Ronnie and Jose are graduates of the
FREE LA high school and Veronique has taught there.  <b>All profit from album sales
will go toward supporting the Youth Justice Coalition’s work in the community.</b></p>

</div></div>","If you have ever tried to make call in a windy weather or while biking you know it is annoying. The wind noise makes it very difficult for others to hear what you are saying. Windmic provides a solution and allows you to connect with people even when the wind blows heavily when you are on the move.

Phone calls are disrupted every day because of the wind noise. Now for the first time we have a solution for you: Windmic - the wind noise killer.








Windmic in action






Technology (patent pending)






Material

Polyurethane material is optimized to block the wind but lets the sound through. The soft polyurethane material also allows you to operate the controls (volume/accept/end call).

Installation

Easy installation for almost any type of handsfree mic. Two different sizes fit most of the models.

Measurements


WIndmic comes in 2 different sizes that fit most of the handsfree mics on the market. Please check the diameter of the handsfree mic before ordering.

We provide the safe popping tools giving everyone an enjoyable and fair chance to find prizes hidden within the tens of thousands of balloons. </p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""257"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q9ZD0YfLyKs?feature=oembed&amp;wmode=transparent"" style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline;"" width=""456""></iframe></div><p></p><h3>What's the environmental impact of a five story balloon sculpture?</h3><p>While tens of thousands of balloons are quite a few balloons, keep in mind that most of the volume of the sculpture will actually be filled with air. All of the balloons used in this sculpture fit on a single shipping pallet. Likewise, once popped, the balloons will return to their initial uninflated size. So around 200 pounds of popped balloons will remain at the conclusion of the event.</p><p><br/></p><h3>But garbage is garbage, right? </h3><p>Indeed. That's why we care so much about what material we use. <i>Airigami creations are <i>primarily </i>made with latex balloons.<b> Latex is a natural product derived from trees and is biodegradable.</b></i> The production of latex is a natural process of many plants, and tapping of the trees does not harm them. Latex harvesting discourages deforestation because latex-producing trees are left intact. A tree can produce latex for up to 40 years. Balloons are a great product for creating big impact with a small ecological footprint.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>Risks and challenges in completing this project</h3><p>Constructing something large with balloons requires that everything be built at the last minute prior to displaying it. Years of experience has made it possible for us to build to something of this magnitude with reasonable certainty that it will be completed as we desire. </p><p><br/></p><h3><b>Possible Challenges:</b></h3><p>•<b> equipment failure </b>- We have a mechanic on our crew, RIchard Hughson, that carries the title of <i>MacGyver</i>. To date, we've never had a structure or piece of equipment fail that he hasn't been able to get working.</p><p><b>• damaged product - </b>The folks that make Qualatex balloons have always stood by their product. It's a really good product that we use for a reason. Problems with it are rare, in our experience. However, things happen. Whenever we've needed more balloons due to unforeseen circumstances, they've always found ways of getting materials to us in time to complete a project.</p><p><b>• human error </b>- Oh, no! An artist misread the plan and made twice as many of one piece, and doesn't have enough balloons for the rest! We're a creative team, and this is an art project. What's important is that the final piece looks amazing. We are flexible, and design challenges can lead to unexpected discoveries. It's all in how you look at it!</p><p><br/></p><b><i>Wow, you're still reading all of this?</i></b>  You must really be interested in the project. That's awesome!

Artist fees. Aside from the many hours that the two of us will put into this by the time it's completed, there are a number of key crew members that will also be putting an enormous amount of time into the project. 

Advertising, marketing and promotion costs
What other funding is the project receiving?The goal we've set on this project is only a small portion of the overall cost of a project this large. We are so happy this year to be working with two wonderful local organizations that are providing financial support and other assistance. The Seneca Park Zoo Society and the YMCA of Greater Rochester are helping to make this not just fun, but also educational. The Pioneer Balloon Company, makers of Qualatex balloons, are also helping to ensure we have the building materials we need. Even as this campaign is running, we're looking for additional external support.
How many people are on the crew?
The size of the crew will depend on the amount of funding we receive, in part because the crew will come from our backers, but also because the funding we receive will determine how large this project can grow. In the past, we've had up to 450 people, including artists, technical staff and members of the local community take part in construction. Key team members responsible for bringing this project to you:Larry Moss - Creative Director, AirigamiKelly Cheatle - Artistic Director, AirigamiSuzanne Haring - Artist WranglerRichard Hughson - MacGyverMichael Hardy - Sponsorship DirectorLanna Lee Maheux - Social Media MavenTodd Neufeld Lisa McIntireDrew RipleyBrian AsmanCan I be on the crew?Yes! Please become a backer of this project. At this time, the only way we are adding crew members is through this Indiegogo campaign.Do I have to be on the crew if I become a backer at $100 or higher?Nope! The invitation to participate is there as an extra way for us to connect to members of the community that wish to take part.Can I come and see the sculpture?Yes, please do! The Airigami Balloon Adventure will be on public display for FREE January 29 - February 7 at the Sibley Building, 250 East Main Street, Rochester, NY 14604. You can even come and watch us as we build it January 25-28. If you have the means, please contribute so everyone can enjoy this work. See the event schedule for more details.What happens to the sculpture at the end of the run?This sculpture will be built using compostable latex balloons. At the end of the public exhibition we will have a Popping Party to take down the sculpture. (Please note, the popping party is a ticketed event.) During the popping party, everyone takes turns to pop balloons in a controlled environment. We provide the safe popping tools giving everyone an enjoyable and fair chance to find prizes hidden within the tens of thousands of balloons. What's the environmental impact of a five story balloon sculpture?While tens of thousands of balloons are quite a few balloons, keep in mind that most of the volume of the sculpture will actually be filled with air. All of the balloons used in this sculpture fit on a single shipping pallet. Likewise, once popped, the balloons will return to their initial uninflated size. So around 200 pounds of popped balloons will remain at the conclusion of the event.But garbage is garbage, right? Indeed. That's why we care so much about what material we use. Airigami creations are primarily made with latex balloons. Latex is a natural product derived from trees and is biodegradable. The production of latex is a natural process of many plants, and tapping of the trees does not harm them. Latex harvesting discourages deforestation because latex-producing trees are left intact. A tree can produce latex for up to 40 years. Balloons are a great product for creating big impact with a small ecological footprint.Risks and challenges in completing this projectConstructing something large with balloons requires that everything be built at the last minute prior to displaying it. Years of experience has made it possible for us to build to something of this magnitude with reasonable certainty that it will be completed as we desire. Possible Challenges:• equipment failure - We have a mechanic on our crew, RIchard Hughson, that carries the title of MacGyver. To date, we've never had a structure or piece of equipment fail that he hasn't been able to get working.• damaged product - The folks that make Qualatex balloons have always stood by their product. It's a really good product that we use for a reason. Problems with it are rare, in our experience. However, things happen. Whenever we've needed more balloons due to unforeseen circumstances, they've always found ways of getting materials to us in time to complete a project.• human error - Oh, no! An artist misread the plan and made twice as many of one piece, and doesn't have enough balloons for the rest! We're a creative team, and this is an art project. What's important is that the final piece looks amazing. We are flexible, and design challenges can lead to unexpected discoveries. It's all in how you look at it!Wow, you're still reading all of this?  You must really be interested in the project. That's awesome! Why don't you scroll back up to the top of the page and back the project? Be sure to tell your friends too. We want to reach as many people as possible to attend the event. Your gift is amplified with every share!

<ul>
<li>
<p>We'll break this down rules-of-poetry-slam style.</p>
<p><b>Rule #1: Slams cost money.</b></p>
<p>National poetry events are an amazing experience: they're like an athletic conference for poets. They bring out teams from across the world for a few nights, and have endless special events, super-famous featured poets hanging around, and require a whole lot of organization and event space. CUPSI is no exception; between April 6th and April 9th, some sixty teams/three hundred-odd poets will be going at it for the glory. As a result, slams like CUPSI cost a lot to attend, and we're sending sixteen poets.  <b>The team will have to pay:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>$1,300 for registration</li>
<li>$6,000 for transporting our 16 members between Ohio and Texas</li>
<li>$2,200 for four days food and lodging</li>
</ul>
<p>For a grand total of <b>$9,500! </b>We know that's no small sum, and we can't pay it by ourselves because:</p>
<p><b>Rule #2: (Student) Poets are broke.</b></p>
<p>These poets are paying for school, books, and living expenses, while making next to no money. And right now, <b>getting money from Oberlin is difficult.</b> Oberlin College is one of the most expensive schools in the country, and many of the poets on our team are low income. We're doing what we can to collect donations, but <b>to get most of the money, </b><i><b>we need you!</b></i></p>
<p><b>Rule #3: People love poetry!</b></p>
<p>Nuts to ""a dying art form,"" we're cultivating a community of writers that thrives on free speech! Where poets put their stories forward in ways that enlighten all of our lives! Where free expression is transformed into freedom from oppression! Where hard truths are spoken loudly for the world to hear!! The world needs more poetry, and this cannot happen without you!!!</p>
<p>But if that's not enough incentive, we have some <b>fantastic rewards</b> for your donations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Team chapbook!</b> Once CUPSI is through, the best work from the team's poems (!!including group pieces!!) will be anthologized in a limited edition chapbook, one of the owners of which will be you!</li>
<li>
<b>Poem postcards!</b> Get a gorgeous postcard featuring some of the work the team produces on the road to CUPSI; some poignant lines to make your heart swell or break that you can keep on your refrigerator forever!</li>
<li>
<b>Team merch! </b>On top of a chapbook and postcard, especially generous donors will receive one of our limited editions OSlam t shirts and sweatshirts, designed by OSlam members themselves.</li>

<p>I've been charged with a great honor and responsibility: supporting the artistic growth of my amazingly gifted child.  I recently found an outstanding, highly-recommended art studio to nurture her budding talent - just as our living expenses increased dramatically. As a single mother it's challenging to simply make ends meet, and in order to provide my daughter with the arts education she deserves, I'm reaching out to her ""public."" </p>
<p>Many of you are already fans of her work through the photos I share on Facebook - at 8 years of age, she's already bringing people joy through her drawings.

<p>Lori Ryland's studio is geared to not only help students develop their technique, but to prepare them for a life in art. With her guidance, they have gallery shows, develop their portfolios, and even sell prints of their work. In the future, she can even help with applying for scholarships to art colleges, should they choose to go that route. Excellent art instructors deserve to be compensated well for their skills, and while her tuition is not 'cheap,' I'm sure it's a bargain considering its worth as a whole. <br/><br/>If you've been moved by, amused by, or have otherwise enjoyed Lily's efforts in the past, I hope you'll consider pitching in a little bit (seriously, no amount is too small) to help her blossom. I cannot WAIT to see what she'll be doing in 5, 10, 15 years and beyond - it may be the mom in me talking, but I truly believe she has the potential to contribute incredible things to the world. Thank you for considering a contribution!</p>

<li>My campaign is designed to fund the last third of this book which I aim to finish this summer, 2017.  With your help, I will be able to finish my book and present it to my publisher who is awaiting its completion.</li>
<li>I invite you to join me on this last leg of this Alaskan journey!  If you have been to Alaska or dreamed of exploring the Last Frontier or just want to see its beauty, I invite you to accompany me on this artistic adventure!  After this Indiegogo campaign is finished, I will be blogging my journey from my boat in Alaska and you can watch me fish and paint every day!  I want this book to promote the conservation of Southeast Alaska's marine life and, with your help, we can make this happen!  Thank you for your support!  I don't take it lightly.</li>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>$5,000 will be used to help print and publish 1,000 copies of my 75-page full color book of paintings and photographs.  $2,500 will be used for fuel, gear and painting supplies.  $1,500 will be used for packaging and shipping all perks to my supporters!</li>
<li>I hope that you will share in my excitement for this project!  I will send you gifts ranging from signed prints on rice paper for a $50 contribution to original black and white gyotaku paintings of Alaska rock fish and a signed first edition finished color book for a $500 donation.</li>
<li>If I don't reach my goal, I will still use any funds donated to help print and publish my book.  Any donation you might provide will not go unappreciated!  Thank you!!!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>My project is important because it allows each contributor a hand in promoting conservation of the marine life of Southeast Alaska.  Together, we can protect our Last Frontier!</li>
<li>As an artist, I have had a number of solo shows both in Alaska and in California.  My art is currently sold in galleries in Alaska and California.  As an avid outdoors-woman, I have studied the marine ecosystem in Southeast Alaska intently and can tell you what kind of fish live where and can talk to you about the life cycle of a Coho salmon, all while painting a gyotaku print of a fish I caught that same day!</li>
<li>I will be spending this summer, 2017, completing this book.  There will be sunny days when Alaska smiles on me; and there will be windy, rough days when the sea is angry and the waves go over the cabin of my boat.  Yet, each day, I will be out on the water for 8-10 hours searching for the last 15 species of fish for my book.  I invite you to watch my video blogs each day this summer as I document this journey!  Your support will help me achieve this goal!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are hurdles in this journey.  I am tenacious and optimistic by nature.  Whether I am able to find the fish each day and complete my prints and paintings each night will depend on my tenacity and hard work.  I love what I do.  I will stop at nothing.  Alaska is beautiful, but its waters can be unforgiving.  It takes a tough soul to put in the time to find each fish in waters ranging from 50 meters to 350 meters in depth.  I have captained my own boat many years and  I can't wait to get back on the waters in Alaska for this last portion of my book.   </li>
<li>Whether or not you've been on a boat, or explored Alaska, you, too, can help me complete this book!  I will keep you up to date every day with my video blogs and will send you personal emails about my progress all summer!</li>

<h3>Social Dress New Orleans - <del>730 days after</del> 10 years after</h3>
<p><i>Social Dress New Orleans</i> is the culmination of a three-month collaborative effort with local volunteers at 1941 Caffin Avenue, located in the Lower Ninth Ward neighborhood. With my team, I applied multiple layers of latex mixed with paint were applied to the exterior of a house that had been damaged by Hurricane Katrina and remained untouched in the summer of 2007. Once these latex panels dried, we peeled them off to create a textured 3-D print of the structure. I also documented the political and physical struggle to create this work on <a href=""http://socialdress.blogspot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">my blog</a>, and my friend, filmmaker <a href=""https://vimeo.com/7188070"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ambarish Manepalli directed a documentary</a> about the process.</p>
<p>I envisioned this piece as a way to make the tragedy of New Orleans tangible to those far removed from the disaster. I had lived in New Orleans from 2000-2003, the first years that I lived in the US after leaving my home country of Japan. For me, New Orleans is my US home, so to watch it being destroyed on my small TV as I unpacked from moving to New York City in August of 2005 was heart wrenching. Because of my financial situation, I couldn't visit right away, but I followed everything I could in the news, online, and in frequent phone calls with my friends who still lived there. Yet I was still unprepared for the scale of destruction that remained when I first returned in the summer of 2006. Cars were still on top of houses, and the streets had barely been cleared in certain neighborhoods a full ten months later. Yet, because the city wanted to boost the tourism market, most press outside the city discussed the successful ""recovery"" of areas like the French Quarter, and the only contradictory evidence that seemed available to those outside the area were these photography exhibitions featuring images of destruction so spectacular they were hard to grasp. I felt we really needed something physical, tangible, that could be taken to sites outside New Orleans to help people far from the destruction grasp the continuing reality of everyday residents in New Orleans.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494498194/dfxwh0noicoqp9ghwpzx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Toward this end, <i>Social Dress New Orleans</i> was displayed as a full structure at Socrates Sculpture Park in New York City from July 2007 to March 2008 and at the Prospect.1 Biennial in New Orleans from October 2008 to January 2009. Individual components of the work were also exhibited at various venues in locations as distinct as Mobile, AL; Hamilton, NY; and Dresden, Germany, yet the opportunity to exhibit the entire house once again has not presented itself until now, a decade after it was originally cast.</p>
<p>Social Dress New Orleans has been included in <a href=""http://www.springbreakartshow.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SPRING BREAK Art Show's BKLYN IMMERSIVE</a>, an exhibition of immersive installations and environments on view from May 6—May 14 at the <a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/1n95o3kJTSE2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">City Point</a> building in Downtown Brooklyn. With three weeks to pack, ship, and install this house-sized work, I felt it was essential to present the work again with the help of an organization like SPRING/BREAK that is good at bringing visibility and a wide-ranging audience to its events. This also felt like the right moment to reconsider the issues faced by New Orleans and the U.S. anew within the context of increased racial tensions, accelerated gentrification, and a set of national policies that parallel the ideals that led to the construction of the MRGO Canal and the flooding of the Lower Ninth Ward during Hurricane Katrina.</p>

<h3>Help Preserve the Work Today and Provide for its Future</h3>
<p>Although the work is already on view at BKLYN IMMERSIVE with the generous support of SPRING/BREAK and CITY POINT, I am thinking about how to sustain the piece after the closing of the exhibition, and to help find a place to store the work as we look for future exhibition venues.</p>
<p>If we can reach the full funding goal of $12,000, we can provide for the future of this project and make sure that I don't have to abandon this piece that so many people contributed to. Although I have been so fortunate that artist, Luis Colmenares, provided a home for <i>Social Dress New Orleans</i> these past eight years, between the cost of returning the work to New Orleans, and the difficulty of finding venues interested in showing the work when it is stored so far away from where I am based in New York, I cannot continue to store the work in New Orleans. But storage is not cheap in the New York area, and I don't currently have a space to place the work, so I also need funds to help store the work until we can find the next place to exhibit this work (otherwise I may be forced to trash it!).</p>
<p>For those who can donate, there are some great perks including t-shirts featuring a design pulled from the address numbers attached to the original house at 1941 Caffin Avenue, a tote bag featuring one of my first sketches of the house as it would be installed at Socrates Sculpture Park, small edition cast latex works from New Orleans, and VIP studio tours.</p>

<h3>Why SPRING BREAK?</h3>
<p>Although Social Dress New Orleans received a lot of press when it was created in 2007, including articles in The New York Times, the Washington Post, the AP, Art in America, and NPR's Studio 360 to name a few, without opportunities to show the work itself, it had fallen off the radar much like the lingering effects of Hurricane Katrina have fallen out of view for most of the American public. SPRING/BREAK Art Show has a history of successful events that receive coverage from major art and news press, and has featured works that go on to successful exhibitions at major art institutions. Additionally, by working at City Point which is centrally located in Downtown Brooklyn near major shopping venues, and by not charging admission, the exhibition itself is available to a wide range of visitors, including those who do not regularly visit art exhibitions. So far we have seen constant foot traffic by a real mixture of arts professionals and passersby who have never gone to an art exhibition before. This is the kind of mixed audience I hope to engage with this work.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>The work is already up, but the challenge is to make this exhibition opportunity a first step in reminding people about the continuing effects of Hurricane Katrina not only in New Orleans, but across the US. This means not only spreading the word about this exhibition and fundraiser as wide as possible, but building momentum and demand for the work to be shown again in prominent venues across the country. I was able to show the work in Prospect.1 because of the many local voices who asked for it to be brought down for the biennial. Now, if I can raise the funds necessary to preserve the work, this will also be a strong demonstration of support that can help me quantify to potential museums, galleries, and other exhibition venues that there is an active and interested audience for the work.</p>

<p>Here is a brief introduction to us, what we do, why we do it, and how you can help!</p>
<ul>
<li>McIntyre Musings is an artist duo out of Tucson, Arizona, Heidi and Casandra McIntyre. For the past two years we have been pouring our hearts and souls into this journey that is an art business. We create original paintings, drawings, sketches, magnets and prints! We love travelling to various shows to share and sell our art, including comic cons, gaming expos, local art fairs, and even at the Davis Monthan Air Force Base! We both love making art and are having a blast sharing all the fun stuff we create with the world!</li>
<li>This campaign was developed to help us supplement our current revenue in order to help us grow into a new market with new shows and new locations. </li>
<li>With the help of our awesome campaign donors, like you, we will be able to take this business to the next level. We will be able to expand our market, build customer base, and build on the solid foundation we have created over the last two years. We started this journey with the help of a campaign just like this, and would like your help again to grow and expand!</li>

<h3>The Impact Your Contribution Can Make</h3>
<p>McIntyre Musings was started with the help of a fundraising campaign, without which we would not be where we are now, a newly successful art business. Having access to fundraising avenues such as this IndieGoGo can have a huge impact on our ability to grow and expand our business while supplementing the current revenue base.</p>
<p>Since the majority of the revenue the business is bringing in is being used for event renewals and material supplies for new projects, this funding would have a most valuable impact on the following:</p>
<ul><li>We would be able to sign up for a series of new events for 2018, expanding our sales market and client base, in turn helping us to continue to grow!</li></ul>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;"">Some of these new events include:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-left:80px;"">Retro City Festival in Pamona, CA</li>
<li style=""margin-left:80px;"">Monterey Comic Con in Monterey, CA</li>
<li style=""margin-left:80px;"">LVL UP Expo in Las Vegas, NV</li>

<li style=""margin-left:80px;"">Kikori Con in Flagstaff, AZ</li>
<li style=""margin-left:80px;"">Permian Basin in Midland, TX, and many more!</li>
<li>We would be able to secure hotels for new and future shows in a timely fashion, allowing us to get the best rates possible.</li>
<li>We would be able to purchase new display equipment. As our product line has grown, and continues to grow, we need more display equipment. This equipment can include table stands, triangle grid racks, portfolio books, etc.</li>
<li>We would be able to purchase more marketing materials, such as business cards, banners, signage, and much more!</li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any business venture, there will always be the potential for risks and challenges to interfere with immediate goals. Here are some of the risks and challenges McIntyre Musings faces in the upcoming show year, 2018.</p>
<ul>
<li>The major risk we face in our industry is not breaking even at new shows due to an unknown, new market. You never know what the foot traffic, event advertising, and other unforeseen circumstances are going to be at new shows.</li>
<li>To minimize this risk we do as much research as possible before we sign up to do a show. Research includes looking at marketing strategies of the host show, looking at the turnout for previous shows, and talking to established artists about the shows they have attended.</li>
<li>Challenges in this industry are many, including: varying size setup spaces, travel and lodging expenses, eating healthy at shows, networking with established artists and show hosts, and being able to have sitting cash to register for new shows when they open as they can tend to sell out quickly.</li>

And we need to do it more often with a cast of diverse voices that echo the artists and community we represent.Help us to help others to fly effortlessly, to break out beyond the studio, to stretch boundaries that seek to keep art quiet, inaccessible to some or out of reach for others, to come together to share experience and ideas, to build community.With your donation to Norte Maar's #makemoreart campaign you may choose a perk that is well worth your money. From tickets to performance, art tours and a rural weekend, to postcard art by Rico Gatson and Tamara Gonzales, ceramic mugs by our artist collaborators in the Adirondacks, or the unique print edition of Audra Wolowiec, you'll find something that connects you with the mission of Norte Maar.

<h3>Arquetopia Printmaking Residency in Puebla, Mexico!</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I've been given the opportunity to spend one month at Arquetopia, a residency program in Puebla, Mexico. I'll have 24/7 access to studios and printmaking facilities, and all the time in the world to draw, carve, ink, press and pull prints!

<p><br/>As an artist, it can be extremely difficult to find the space and time to create.

I'm interested in creation and destruction, and the connection between human and nature. The first image I chose was of the US/Mexico border.

<b>Crystal Banks, a formerly homeless mother</b>, described her experience of homelessness when she said,<b><i> </i></b>""One
of the hardest things about being homeless was that I was so afraid to tell anybody that I was homeless.<span> You get
looked down upon, because people don’t even stop to try and hear your story and
understand why you’re homeless. <b>You’re just automatically
put in that box of, ‘You’re homeless.</b><span><b> You’re a bad person</b>. You
obviously did something wrong.’ And
that’s not the case... </span>This has
been one of the most humbling experiences that I’ve ever had.” </span><i><span> </span>
</i><br/><br/>Motivated by the experiences of the homeless and countless examples of public art, which help people see homelessness differently, we, at Shalom, felt Bloomington needed its own public message of compassion, inscribed in community art.<br/><br/>That inspiration led us to the perfect person to move this idea forward, <b>community artist, Joe LaMantia</b>. With 20
years of experience as a collaborative community artist, Joe has completed over
40 similar projects all over Indiana and the Midwest (<a href=""http://www.lamantiastudio.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.lamantiastudio.com</a>).<br/><br/>Through Joe's unique team-building process, guests of Shalom, students and staff from local schools, and members of
the general public will all be involved in the design, creation, and construction of this unique art spectacle, which, when completed, will be available for all to learn from and enjoy.<br/><br/><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get<br/>
</h3>The overall
cost of this public art project is about $14,000. Through the generous
funding of the Bloomington Arts Commission, the Bloomington Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Commission, and the Bloomington Urban Enterprise Association, we have already raised over $4,000 to get us started.<br/><br/><b>Our crowd-funding goal is $10,000</b>, which will cover the remaining costs associated with the creation, installation, and fundraising of the project, including the costs for the artist and the materials needed to complete the project.<br/><br/><p>When the project is complete, Bloomington will have a public art piece of both beauty and compassion. <b>It will serve as a symbol and a reminder to our community to live with open hearts</b> to the marginalized and downtrodden in our community.<br/></p>
We know that many of you prefer to give simply from the kindness of your own hearts, but <b>we also have some gifts for you to say THANK YOU for your support</b>. Our favorite is having your name permanently inscribed on the sculpture to acknowledge your generosity to making this work of beauty real. Check out all the other THANK YOUs to see what best fits you and your desire and ability to help.<br/><br/>100% of the funding we raise over the final costs of the art piece will be dedicated to the work of Shalom Community Center to help aid and empower people experiencing hunger, homelessness, and poverty.<br/><br/><h3>The Impact - Details on the Art Piece</h3>
<h3>
</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Until you've witnessed it, it's hard to explain the level of prejudice and even hatred directed at people experiencing homelessness. We believe this community art piece will play a significant role in helping our community open up in understanding and compassion.<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>We have already
conducted <b>Brainstorming sessions </b>where ideas, thoughts and drawings, related
to the project, were collected from the community. The <b>Design Phase</b>
incorporated ideas generated by these sessions into the project design with a
strong focus on recyclable, reused materials which are the media of choice of
Project Artist Joe LaMantia. A <b>Review
Committee </b>was formed to
oversee and provide feedback on the project at all stages as it moves towards
completion. </p>
<p>The <b>Heart Shelter</b> is the main element of
the project. It will be placed in front of the Shalom Community Center at 620
S. Walnut Street. It will be constructed almost completely of donated recycled
materials (galvanized street posts and signs, car license plates, tiles and
mirrors). </p>

will be displayed on the windows that stretch across the entire front of the
Shalom Center, just behind the Heart Shelter. This mural will be a black

story worth sharing”, will appear above the silhouette.

<p>A <b>Wild Life Sanctuary</b>, composed of native
plants found in Indiana, will be planted around the Heart Shelter. Also included
will be painted birdhouses, a mason bee house, a butterfly house, and a
birdbath.

</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The project is now in the<b> Fabrication </b>phase<b>.</b> The primary structure and the heart
are being constructed. Mirror pieces are being attached to the heart by students
at Stone Belt. Students at
Hoosier Hills Career Center are creating other parts of the framework,
including the weather vane that will sit atop the sculpture. </p>
<p>In the
summer, Shalom guests, students, and the general public will be
invited to get involved in building and assembling the rest of the sculpture. </p>
<p>The <b>installation</b> phase will begin with the pouring
of footers in the space in front of the Shalom Center. The sculpture will then
be moved over to the site by truck and installed by the use of a crane, in the fall
of 2015.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div> <p> In moving this project forward, we've overcome many challenges already, including finding the right artist, getting the appropriate permissions from the City, designing the art project, and obtaining some initial funding for the work.</p>
<p>Our next biggest challenge is raising the additional funding to make this work. That's where YOU come in. With YOUR support, we will take this beautiful dream and make it into a real work of art!!<br/></p>

years of experience as a collaborative community artist, Joe has completed over
40 similar projects all over Indiana and the Midwest (www.lamantiastudio.com).Through Joe's unique team-building process, guests of Shalom, students and staff from local schools, and members of
the general public will all be involved in the design, creation, and construction of this unique art spectacle, which, when completed, will be available for all to learn from and enjoy.What We Need & What You Get
The overall
cost of this public art project is about $14,000. Through the generous
funding of the Bloomington Arts Commission, the Bloomington Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Commission, and the Bloomington Urban Enterprise Association, we have already raised over $4,000 to get us started.Our crowd-funding goal is $10,000, which will cover the remaining costs associated with the creation, installation, and fundraising of the project, including the costs for the artist and the materials needed to complete the project.When the project is complete, Bloomington will have a public art piece of both beauty and compassion. It will serve as a symbol and a reminder to our community to live with open hearts to the marginalized and downtrodden in our community.
We know that many of you prefer to give simply from the kindness of your own hearts, but we also have some gifts for you to say THANK YOU for your support. Our favorite is having your name permanently inscribed on the sculpture to acknowledge your generosity to making this work of beauty real. Check out all the other THANK YOUs to see what best fits you and your desire and ability to help.100% of the funding we raise over the final costs of the art piece will be dedicated to the work of Shalom Community Center to help aid and empower people experiencing hunger, homelessness, and poverty.The Impact - Details on the Art Piece



Until you've witnessed it, it's hard to explain the level of prejudice and even hatred directed at people experiencing homelessness. We believe this community art piece will play a significant role in helping our community open up in understanding and compassion.



We have already
conducted Brainstorming sessions where ideas, thoughts and drawings, related
to the project, were collected from the community. The Design Phase
incorporated ideas generated by these sessions into the project design with a
strong focus on recyclable, reused materials which are the media of choice of
Project Artist Joe LaMantia. A Review
Committee was formed to
oversee and provide feedback on the project at all stages as it moves towards
completion. 
The Heart Shelter is the main element of
the project. It will be placed in front of the Shalom Community Center at 620
S. Walnut Street. It will be constructed almost completely of donated recycled
materials (galvanized street posts and signs, car license plates, tiles and
mirrors). 



A  Mural
will be displayed on the windows that stretch across the entire front of the
Shalom Center, just behind the Heart Shelter. This mural will be a black
silhouette of people who are guests of Shalom. A statement “Like you, I have a
story worth sharing”, will appear above the silhouette.




A Wild Life Sanctuary, composed of native
plants found in Indiana, will be planted around the Heart Shelter. Also included
will be painted birdhouses, a mason bee house, a butterfly house, and a
birdbath.


 
The project is now in the Fabrication phase. The primary structure and the heart
are being constructed. Mirror pieces are being attached to the heart by students
at Stone Belt. Students at
Hoosier Hills Career Center are creating other parts of the framework,
including the weather vane that will sit atop the sculpture. 
In the
summer, Shalom guests, students, and the general public will be
invited to get involved in building and assembling the rest of the sculpture. 
The installation phase will begin with the pouring
of footers in the space in front of the Shalom Center. The sculpture will then
be moved over to the site by truck and installed by the use of a crane, in the fall
of 2015.
Risks & Challenges
  In moving this project forward, we've overcome many challenges already, including finding the right artist, getting the appropriate permissions from the City, designing the art project, and obtaining some initial funding for the work.
Our next biggest challenge is raising the additional funding to make this work. That's where YOU come in. With YOUR support, we will take this beautiful dream and make it into a real work of art!!
  Other Ways You Can Help We know that not all of you can help out financially as much as you'd like, but you can still help!!

<i>The Shower from the series Sauerbrunn by © Navina Neverla</i><br/>
<br/><br/></span></b><span>The entire project is estimated with an amount of 17.000 Euro 
which is 19.200 $. From this amount, a partly amount of the financial 
ressources shall come from two Hamburg-based institution: Hamburgische 
Kulturstiftung 5000 Euro, that is 6200 $ &amp; Rudolf Augstein Stiftung with 2300 Euro, that is 2600 $.  Funding applications have been sent out accordingly already.</span><b><span><br/></span></b><p></p>

<span>In order to realise this piece to its potential and to fairly compensate my incredible collaborators, I am seeking funds to support the following costs:</span><p></p>
</div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<div>
<span>    Budget remuneration for staff: 10.300 $ (= 9100 Euro) Compensation for our Team members, that includes: Video editor, Sound artist, Visual Artist creating the swing sculpture, PR, Production, Producer, Camera. </span><p></p>
</div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<div>
<span>    Costs for production material  8980 $ = (7950 Euro). This includes technical equipment such as Cameras, Projectors, Editing devices, the Material for the swing sculpture, the printing of Fine Art Fotography, travel expenses, accomodation for the team. </span><p></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<div>
<span> </span>
</div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<div>
<span>With the funding goal of 10.000 $ (=8700 Euro) we will be able to implement this project . If we bypass the funding threshold and raise 19.200 $ (= 17.050  Euro) we would be able to go one step further by being able to have a decent budget that covers for income fee of artists as well as production costs.<br/><br/></span>
</div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<div>
<span>    This project guarantees added value for the society as well as art industry due to it's universal theme as well it's holistic; multicultural and multidisciplinary approach.<br/><br/><b>A detailed budget plan exists of course and can be sent any time upon request.</b><br/></span><p></p>

supposed to hold on to it or catch it. But instead you are meant to care for it
and cherish it. It is like a present that you receive from the universe or
nature.” [Female voice over]
 THE JUMP from the series SAUERBRUNN by © Navina Neverla What has already happened?The project has already received funding in order to cover for production from Larga Marcha Arte y Ediciones, Spain for editing by Marcos Flórez in 2015 and from HfBK Academy of Fine Arts Hamburg in 2012 for shooting on super8 Film. It has been mentored in the second phase by Victor Jorge, Prof.  for Moving Image at Ar.Co Centro de Arte e Communicação Visual Lisbon as well as by the artist patron Carlos García-Alix.Under this link you can find a the raw edit that has resulted from these 2 production phases so far:: What is happening now? We have very recently been invited for an artistic residency  by AADK to Centro Negra | Espacio de Investigación y Creación Contemporánea in Murcia, Spain from August - October 2016.  This is THE  unique chance!Moreover, Gängeviertel,  Hamburg, Germany is looking forward to present the work at the Galerie Raum Links Rechts in Hamburg.THE FEET from the series SAUERBRUNN by © Navina NeverlaIn order to finish this wonderful project, we are now going into the 3rd. phase of production for which we are now launching this crowdfunding campaign! Please help us finishing this amazing project by supporting with a financial contribution or even sharing it amongst your friends. What is it about?
Sauerbraunn - Hold on to Freedom is an interactive multimedia installation
created by Navina Neverla & her team. ""It is an art work about Presence and Absence"" [María Rogel, LAPOR].The universal theme of this work moves in an endless loop through 3 different stages::1. Home / Paradise / Safety / Security and Comfort2. Trauma / Loss / Disintegration / Fragmentation /Dissolving of structures3. Transcending / Detachment/ Letting goHave you ever experienced a total loss? Can you identify?In fact Sauerbrunn - Hold on to Freedom is my very personal story of the loss of my grandparents house in Austria, where I have spent the wonderful time of my childhood and those beautiful childhood memories of peacefulness & nature, which was like a home to me, a place of comfort, security, love and safety. A little paradise, where things seem to always remain the same and time stands still. A home, which I otherwise did not have due to my international & intercultural background, always moving around...What is researched? 
Due to it's theme of paradise the work raises questions around the relationship between ART and KITSCH. And in the course of the realization of the project those questions shall be researched
and reflected upon & respectively their limits will be sounded. Super8 Film Still Image THE CHERRIES from SAUERBRUNN by © Navina NeverlaHowever, this story of paradise, loss, finally transcending & letting go of that that loss will not be told in a common way!How will the project be implemented & presented?The artwork will consist of Moving Image: Super 8 Film in b/w & color, Analogue Fine Art 
Photography Prints, Sound Art, Elements that engage with the sense of 
Smell & a Big Swing, in the middle of a space, as an interactive 
component, that invites audience members to engage with their 
kinesthetic sense. Fotography Installation by Navina Neverla recently presented at Galeria Bessa Artes Lisbon 2016Furthermore, the finished edited super8 Film shall be projected on 3 walls of the same room, fotos 
hanging from the roof, sound artist composing and mixing live sound, a big swing in

Who is the Artistic Director? Portrait Navina Neverla Foto by Julia HehlkeMy Name is Navina Neverla and I am a multimedia artist born in Germany in 1984, of Indian and Austrian descent. I am a Nomad, living inbetween cultures and coutries. A so-called third culture kid. As an artist in transition between Performance & Visual Arts, I am interested in crossing, merging, experimenting, transcending & mixing media. 
In fact my recent art work fluctuates between Installation & Performance Art. In my work I am to think out of the box. My work is collaborative, sometimes conceptual and I am to cross boundaries of art forms and cultures. Basically I believe that all is one and there are no limits.

My work has
been presented since 2007 at  Kampnagel Hamburg,
DanceKiosk, Gängeviertel, Künstlerhaus Vorwerkstift, AmbulArt Mexico, Galeria
Bessa Artes & a variety of international short film festivals. 
Selected for a Fleetstreet Residency;
Project Funding from Hamburg’s Cultural Ministry, Augstein- and Hamburgische
Kulturstiftung in the past.And I have worked as a performer amongst others
with Bojana Cvejic at Tate Modern, Vânia Rovisco, André Guedes, Isabelle Schad
& God’s Entertainment.
Holding an MA Creative Practice from Laban/ ID London,
Diploma in Visual Communication from HFBK Academy of Fine Arts and BA in Mediaculture. 
Recently been invited by Victor Jorge, Prof. Ar.Co Lisbon to join the collective Súbita Prácticas de Composição e Criação.

Where does your money go?

The Shower from the series Sauerbrunn by © Navina Neverla
The entire project is estimated with an amount of 17.000 Euro 
which is 19.200 $. From this amount, a partly amount of the financial 
ressources shall come from two Hamburg-based institution: Hamburgische 
Kulturstiftung 5000 Euro, that is 6200 $ & Rudolf Augstein Stiftung with 2300 Euro, that is 2600 $.  Funding applications have been sent out accordingly already.




In order to realise this piece to its potential and to fairly compensate my incredible collaborators, I am seeking funds to support the following costs:




    Budget remuneration for staff: 10.300 $ (= 9100 Euro) Compensation for our Team members, that includes: Video editor, Sound artist, Visual Artist creating the swing sculpture, PR, Production, Producer, Camera. 




    Costs for production material  8980 $ = (7950 Euro). This includes technical equipment such as Cameras, Projectors, Editing devices, the Material for the swing sculpture, the printing of Fine Art Fotography, travel expenses, accomodation for the team. 






 







 




With the funding goal of 10.000 $ (=8700 Euro) we will be able to implement this project . If we bypass the funding threshold and raise 19.200 $ (= 17.050  Euro) we would be able to go one step further by being able to have a decent budget that covers for income fee of artists as well as production costs.




    This project guarantees added value for the society as well as art industry due to it's universal theme as well it's holistic; multicultural and multidisciplinary approach.A detailed budget plan exists of course and can be sent any time upon request.


How can you help if you really do not have any money at all?
We are so grateful if you will help us spreading the word by telling people about the project and sharing this link on your social media or even in an Email to selected people: 
https://www.indiegogo.com/project/preview/2209b671
Thank you so much! :)




What are the risks and challenges?
The project will be realised either way. The question at stake is, how can we as artists do our work and earn a minimum renumeration, while having a realistic budget available that covers the budget for production such as needed technical equipment. So please help us to create the best outcome possible and to create decent working conditions for the artists of the team. 

How we will show our gratitude for your support?
In gratitude for the means to be free to create and complete a work 
that meets my aspirations and vision, I am so grateful for the enormous 
contributions of the creative community who have helped me each step- in
 so many ways. This artwork represents a new level of collaboration for 
me, and I am thrilled to be able to share the process of creation and

With the small self-adhesive foam rubber tiles, Pixeneer can get your creative juices flowing around!We probably all have bare wall in our home. The one that we’re going to hang a picture on. One that’s stylistic yet personal. One that melts in with the rest of the décor but still stands out. The wall remains bare. Just simply stick the Pixeneer tiles on wherever you like and turn your wall into a work of ART. Don’t worry, they won’t damage your wall and they can be reused for over 50 times and even washable with the special sticker behind! We are a group of professional engineers who are extremely passionate with Pixel Art. There is a new trend around the world that lots of famous pixel artist bringing their design from gallery or museum onto the street. They believe that they are hackers of public space spreading a virus of mosaic. As museums and galleries are not accessible to everyone, installing them at street level will let ordinary people enjoy the art on a daily basis.Inspired by them, we come up with an idea that we might even bring them back to our home – to design a stylish home with pixel street art! After 2 years of infinite trials and errors, we finally got to the final step of our product development cycle. So please support us and bring these stunning and innovative wall decorations back to your home.Each tile is 2cm x 2cm x 0.8 cm in size, weighting less than 1 gram. It is made of light and durable EVA foam rubber. EVA-foam rubbers are completely harmless, resistant and baby- friendly.The sticker behind is specially designed and has several features. We have tested over hundred types of different materials to come up with these stickers. They are self-adhesive, waterproof and can be reused for unlimited times. The most important thing is no residue will be left on your wall!!The Pixeneer chips can also be washed with water to clean the dirt and will not leave any residue on your wall. They can be fixed to most types of walls, including the wall inside your bathroom and the uneven ones. However, a freshly painted wall should dry for at least 14 days prior to fixing Pixeneer chips.Pixeneer is available in 16 colors: Red, Orange, Yellow, Pale green, Green, Dark Green, Cyan, Blue, Violet, Pink, Skin Tone, Brown, Grey, Dark Grey, Deep Grey and Black.We are working on reference drawings for hundreds of different design and we will be ready to build an online platform that will clearly show all the designs and can be viewed by smart phones.For each box of Pixeneer, we will include a reference drawing with instructions to show how easy it is for you to create your masterpiece with Pixeneer chips.We also plan to create an online platform that allows everyone to create Pixeneer art themselves and share their masterpiece with the community. Within this platform, we can gather all the fans of pixel art and let everyone interact with each other. Everyone can be a Pixeneer!Demos:\After you back our project, please kindly send us a message and we will arrange the design package for you. We will contact you individually to confirm the design package arrangement.Design for the Hex Pixeneer:We can't express how grateful we are to have all you here with us.

<p>Ever wondered what a giant LED amusement park for grownups would look like? Well, we think about this on a rather strangely often basis and so this year the question will finally be answered, Dragon Burn style to boot!</p>
<p>The Electric Menagerie began as a germ of a concept in early 2018, as local Shanghai-based artists put their heads together in efforts towards a powerful vision for the 2018 Regional China Burn a.k.a. Dragon Burn. Various members of this collective had previously worked on wildly successful exhibits including Hammockville (3 years total experience), TRON, LadyFest, Storm Festival, and many more with clients including K11, 1933 Art Space, Island6 Art Collective, Remy Martin, Kulou and dozens more in collaboration with hundreds of local foreign and domestic artists/designers/creative types. </p>
<p>However, this year was going to special, since everyone was motivated to kick things off early and so therefore enabling a greater effort with more impact and benefit to the festival. And so, The Menagerie (as it’s referred to in a shorter context, or TEM, or The Electric Menagerie if you’ve got time to spare) was born. </p>
<p>It started off with a basic, relatively simple idea - how about a giant robotic LED-lit spider sculpture? How could we build something like this, and would it be combustible? All these ponderings eventually progressed into the current concept which resembles more of an exotic petting zoo for mad-hatters then anything else, if we had to sum it up in a short summary format. Or rather - A playground for the creative souls, the Post-Y Generation of digital nomadic types who are intrinsically drawn towards the innate beauty of illuminated LED abstract artworks. </p>
<p>Eventually, the Menagerie concept was adapted to integrate as part of Hammockville, which also needs funding for Boxton, the art corner, Comfortress, and our various other essential neighborhoods that are being planned by our eager team known affectionally as Hamacas (the chosen residential nomenclature for said tribe of comfort enthusiasts). </p>
<p>Hammockville is the coziest spot at Dragon Burn, for it offers everything comfort, cuddly, and cushy. Walking around town, we welcome you to visit our different boroughs of relaxation, sensory stimulation, and creativity. Our little town features a number of small neighborhoods that provide something for everyone - you may sway the day away in a 10-person hammock, or find yourself relaxing in The Comfortress (communal fort area for hosting DJ sets &amp; workshops &amp; more), or maybe you’ll end up in Slack City or Boxton. </p>
<p>Hammockville is a community that welcomes everyone. We will have communal meals twice a day and take turns preparing for events and workshops. By day, Hammockville is a dream garden with never ending chill spots, hidden caches of hammocks and good vibes while at night it becomes a glowing LED playground. With an extensive network of LED cables connecting all corners of the camp, we ensure that we will be glowing all night long. This year, Hammockville will feature The Electric Menagerie as a psychedelic sculpture installation for late night chill outs as well as a compliment/roast chair, 3D printed chaos, Wook’s LED masterpiece “Illumination Type One” and many more surprises! </p>
<p>Hammockville 是“龙焰”最舒服的位置，为人们提供最舒服，轻松，怡人的环境。</p>
<p>我们欢迎你走进我们的小镇，参观小镇不同的区域，轻松小镇，感官刺激小镇和创意小镇。 我们的小镇旨在建立多个为每个人提供服务的小型社区。 </p>
<p>你可以在一个供十人使用的吊床里摇上一整天；自由自在地在休息区里休憩（宽敞的供人休憩的工作室和DJ台），又或者你会在Slack City或者 Boxton小镇的快乐氛围中结束一天。 </p>
<p>想了解更多关于这些区域的朋友，请加入我们的阵营并且跟我们一起合作，让我们知道今年你想在Hammockville看到的东西。</p>

<p>One of our teens, Star, began attending the weekly ChopArt sessions after she’d been kicked out of her house when she and her parents discovered her teen pregnancy. At first Star didn’t really trust anyone, and for good reason. The adults around her had demonstrated their disinterest in her well being, and she was on the streets with her baby growing inside her not knowing where she would sleep or if she would have a meal outside of school hours. Despite her reluctance to speak to the ChopArt staff, she came every week to sit in a corner of the room and write poetry. While the rest of the class worked on their canvas work, Star covered her canvas with red paint and carved her poetry into the wet paint before drowning her words in another layer of red paint. She did this for about a month...she literally drowned out her own voice over and over again. About 6 weeks in, Star came to the shelter and didn’t pick up any supplies. She just sat. Her ChopArt mentor went over to that corner of the room and sat with her. Silently, she just sat there with Star willing her and giving her permission to feel whatever it was she was going through. After about a half hour, Star began to cry. It was almost like she was crying for everything that had ever gone wrong in her life. She revealed that she’d lost the baby. She was stressed and malnourished and didn’t make it past the first trimester. This was such a horrific outcome, we couldn’t imagine how she’d mustered up the strength to come to class. Later Star told us that ChopArt class was the only place she could exhale, it was the only place she didn’t feel judged, and it was the only place she felt like she was in control.<br/><br/>This is what it means for the Arts to be a tool for trauma recovery for homeless teens.<br/><br/>A little over a year ago, ChopArt's CEO &amp; Founder met Sara Blakely, Founder of Spanx, and her wonderful team. Our Founder, along with some other incredible women sat at Center for Civic Innovation (CCI), poured their hearts out to Sara which resulted in an investment in 10 women entrepreneurs for 2017. That investment elevated ChopArt with ongoing training from CCI, the ability to try new strategies and serve more teens, and the privilege to work alongside 9 other brilliant women entrepreneurs. </p>
<p>We are hoping to continue serving homeless teens with that same momentum! It only take $55 to sponsor a teen for a full year of Arts mentorship. Please make this investment in our teens to show Star and her peers that you are committed to her well being and her ability to be seen. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I discovered (and fell in love with) clay in 1971 when I was a sophomore in high school. For more than 20 years I studied ceramics in high school and college. And though I also worked toward a career that would pay the bills, for several years I sold everything from clay jewelry to large decorative sculptural pots in crafts fairs and shows, winning several competitions around the Intermountain West.</p>
<p>In 1996 I got married and started nearly a 20-year stretch where I gave up doing pottery and became a community college writing teacher and adult educator and missionary. I was doing my best to help people, working in the Native American population in the American Southwest.</p>
<p>In 2013, I ended up in the hospital due to the stress of a too-heavy workload in a Christian nonprofit. I ""retired"" from this, and, wondering what I would do next, I purchased my first electric potter's wheel with money from my mother's estate. This is when I had the ""crazy"" idea of using my gifts as an artist and potter to reach hurting people among this population. I quickly learned that it was not a crazy idea at all, but something many people around the world were beginning to use: creating in the arts as a way to open hurting and traumatized individual's hearts, leading to opportunities to learn and grow and move ahead in life.</p>
<p>As you participate in this, you will be enabling suffering people to move ahead in their lives, when otherwise they would remain stuck as victims of trauma and hurt.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I have been working with the local college adult education center director for the last three years. She has asked me to set up a pottery/art studio in the center, which I have started to do. This is an amazing opportunity to use the arts in this setting and to be able to offer classes to the community at large.</p>
<p>To do this properly, I need $15,000: $5,000 to set up the studio, $3,000 to refurbish and set up a class-sized gas kiln that was donated, and $6,000 for a used pickup truck for hauling all the various things involved in a project like this. I have created spreadsheets that detail the specific needs in each of these areas.</p>
<p>If you participate in this project, you will be helping to set up the first studio of its kind in this area.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>1. Though I have been firing my own small gas kiln for many years, I have never rebuilt a large one, like the one that's been donated. I had to remove all the bricks before I could haul it along a very bumpy dirt road and then 175 miles further to Gallup. I believe I have the skills, and I am sure many people will be interested in this project. After all, this is not about me; it is about all of us.</p>
<p>2. I am raising funds now for setup but will need funds for a continuous operation of the studio. The costs are relatively low because I am not in my own building, and I will be charging students in the community. I am also very interested in reaching out to all the various ethnic groups in the community to encourage their participation. This is certainly part of what this is all about.</p>
<p>3. I have done things by myself my whole life, so it is a new challenge to enlist others to participate and to not just be in charge and make sure things are done my way. However, on the other side, the last several years (I'm 62 now), something significant has happened inside me so that I am able to reach out to others in ways I never could before.</p>
<p>4. Since I am setting up the kiln on the center property, it is possible that I will have to move it to my home (liability, etc.). The kiln can be moved, on paved city streets, to my home.</p>

<p>There are many ways, outside the financial, where you can help! Certainly, if you live in the area, you can contact me and we can talk about how you might help.

Finally, you might know of equipment or tools that you or someone else is not using that could be send this way.</p>
</div><p> </p></div>","Short Summary
I discovered (and fell in love with) clay in 1971 when I was a sophomore in high school. For more than 20 years I studied ceramics in high school and college. And though I also worked toward a career that would pay the bills, for several years I sold everything from clay jewelry to large decorative sculptural pots in crafts fairs and shows, winning several competitions around the Intermountain West.
In 1996 I got married and started nearly a 20-year stretch where I gave up doing pottery and became a community college writing teacher and adult educator and missionary. I was doing my best to help people, working in the Native American population in the American Southwest.
In 2013, I ended up in the hospital due to the stress of a too-heavy workload in a Christian nonprofit. I ""retired"" from this, and, wondering what I would do next, I purchased my first electric potter's wheel with money from my mother's estate. This is when I had the ""crazy"" idea of using my gifts as an artist and potter to reach hurting people among this population. I quickly learned that it was not a crazy idea at all, but something many people around the world were beginning to use: creating in the arts as a way to open hurting and traumatized individual's hearts, leading to opportunities to learn and grow and move ahead in life.
As you participate in this, you will be enabling suffering people to move ahead in their lives, when otherwise they would remain stuck as victims of trauma and hurt.

What We Need & What You Get
I have been working with the local college adult education center director for the last three years. She has asked me to set up a pottery/art studio in the center, which I have started to do. This is an amazing opportunity to use the arts in this setting and to be able to offer classes to the community at large.
To do this properly, I need $15,000: $5,000 to set up the studio, $3,000 to refurbish and set up a class-sized gas kiln that was donated, and $6,000 for a used pickup truck for hauling all the various things involved in a project like this. I have created spreadsheets that detail the specific needs in each of these areas.
If you participate in this project, you will be helping to set up the first studio of its kind in this area. The only pottery classes available in this area at this time are those at the local community college, but one has to sign up for a semester. The classes I offer will be very individualized, and, as I have already stated, will offer a ""community of love"" in which to work and grow.
Finally, there are perks! For the last four years, I have been working part-time getting my pottery skills back. I have made mainly bowls and mugs and will offer these are perks. For a $50 contribution, you will receive a mug (you can specify how small or large). For a $75 contribution, you will receive a planter or serving-size bowl. For a $150 contribution, you will receive a set of 4 cereal-sized bowls. For larger contributions, we can work out something.
My pieces are made of high-fired stoneware or porcelain and are microwave and dishwasher safe.
The Impact
Why is this project valuable? Gallup, NM (where I live) is 75% Native American, 20% Hispanic, and 5% all others. Poverty, violence, and alcohol and drug abuse are far above the national averages. Because of this, the high school dropout rate is high, and of those wanting to attend the local community college (UNM-Gallup), 80% require remedial courses before they can take regular college classes. The question is, always, ""How do we help people in this region to succeed in life?""  Frequently, an individual needs time to work through and heal past hurts and trauma, in an adult education environment, before he or she can take classes that will enable them to achieve a high school equivalency diploma. This is where Hope Pottery & Arts comes in. Located in the adult education center, students are already in a place where they have the opportunity to learn, and now they will be able to create in clay and other materials, an activity that helps push back trauma and open the heart to healing. Just one example: Judy (not her real name) deals with anger issues. She comes from a home where not only is she not wanted, but where her mother has told her that she ought to kill herself so the mother won't have to deal with her. Amazingly, she still comes to class. But sometimes it is too much for her and she can't stay in the classroom. She came outside and help me work on a project where I was creating a framework on which to put 400 handprints in clay. After 15 minutes, she was able to return to class and finish her work. The teacher told me later how powerful this was. It is seeing this scenario repeat itself over and over that will come of your participation in this project. 
Risks & Challenges
1. Though I have been firing my own small gas kiln for many years, I have never rebuilt a large one, like the one that's been donated. I had to remove all the bricks before I could haul it along a very bumpy dirt road and then 175 miles further to Gallup. I believe I have the skills, and I am sure many people will be interested in this project. After all, this is not about me; it is about all of us.
2. I am raising funds now for setup but will need funds for a continuous operation of the studio.

I am also very interested in reaching out to all the various ethnic groups in the community to encourage their participation. This is certainly part of what this is all about.
3. I have done things by myself my whole life, so it is a new challenge to enlist others to participate and to not just be in charge and make sure things are done my way.

<li>
<strong>You</strong>: In exchange of your support, we are making <strong>limited edition prints</strong> to add to (or start) your art collection. Each of which comes with our infinite gratitude!<br/> </li>

Today we are looking for your support to make the Liminal Pavilion a success! We are collaborating with the Bangkok Biennial 2020 to create, organize, and realize a pavilion that will showcase groundbreaking and under-represented artists from around the globe. It will be presented twice: first in Montreal, Canada (Oct 31st- Nov 21st), then in Bangkok (March 13 -April 3rd). Consisting of digital prints and video works, the Liminal Pavilion is born from the transformation our world is undergoing. We wish to take these uncertain times and show how it can be an incentive to creativity, social connections, and eye-opening possibilities.  The Liminal Pavilion is a platform that amplifies these voices of change, these new realities. Why Do We Need Your Help?Right now, the pavilion is 100% self-funded by us, Litote. We are seeking your help in alleviating  certain costs related to the production of this project and allow us to offer a participation fee to our amazing artists!!! So how will we use the funds?We came up with an approach that benefits everyone involved : You, the Artists, and the Pavilion. This is how it works: 

You: In exchange of your support, we are making limited edition prints to add to (or start) your art collection. Each of which comes with our infinite gratitude! 

Artists: We believe that every artist deserves financial compensation for their creative work. That's why 50% of each print sold goes directly in the artist's pocket. 

The Pavilion: With this money, we will:

Produce and ship to you the limited print you chose

Buy technological material to show the works ( mini-screens, raspberry Pi)

Create digital prints on vinyl to be shown at the venue ( around 20 prints)

Build a marketing campaign that will allow all our artists to be at the forefront of this event

<h3>Short Summary of the Owner, The Dream, &amp; The Obstacles</h3>
<ul>
<li>My name is Brian K. Rice. I've worked over 15 years in engineering across many cities but my DREAM was to move back home and create spaces in under served areas for ENTREPRENEURS and for PEOPLE DEVELOPMENT so we can IMPROVE our communities.</li>
<li>I thought with my engineering background and the purchasing of the buildings it would have been easier to secure funding create spaces for the Arts, Business Incubators, Entrepreneurship Development, Restaurants, Lofts and more. I learned that when banks don't want to loan in certain communities they find ways to do just that. In my case, the bank had my 8 buildings appraised at $0, making it the worst appraisal not just in Alabama but in the United States. 5 of the buildings are in the background of the Believe in Ensley Urban Studios picture.  These buildings have value and our communities have value. If you remove the inequality in banking, I would have received my funding almost 2 years ago and all 8 of my buildings would be completed with a variety of businesses that add vibrancy, new jobs, restaurants, technology focused spaces, youth entrepreneurship, business incubators, mixed with the visual arts and performing arts for music, painters, and dance for the community. It is very important that others know that local access to resources has been the greatest obstacle for African Americans for well over 100 years. We have to get creative and I'm hoping you invest in this project to launch the next phase of development. </li>
<li>By contributing and helping us reach our rehab goal for the Urban Studios, you will help create spaces for over 25 CREATIVE ENTREPRENEURS from this community and surrounding communities</li>
</ul>

My name is Brian K. Rice. I've worked over 15 years in engineering across many cities but my DREAM was to move back home and create spaces in under served areas for ENTREPRENEURS and for PEOPLE DEVELOPMENT so we can IMPROVE our communities.
I thought with my engineering background and the purchasing of the buildings it would have been easier to secure funding create spaces for the Arts, Business Incubators, Entrepreneurship Development, Restaurants, Lofts and more. I learned that when banks don't want to loan in certain communities they find ways to do just that. In my case, the bank had my 8 buildings appraised at $0, making it the worst appraisal not just in Alabama but in the United States. 5 of the buildings are in the background of the Believe in Ensley Urban Studios picture.  These buildings have value and our communities have value. If you remove the inequality in banking, I would have received my funding almost 2 years ago and all 8 of my buildings would be completed with a variety of businesses that add vibrancy, new jobs, restaurants, technology focused spaces, youth entrepreneurship, business incubators, mixed with the visual arts and performing arts for music, painters, and dance for the community. It is very important that others know that local access to resources has been the greatest obstacle for African Americans for well over 100 years. We have to get creative and I'm hoping you invest in this project to launch the next phase of development. 
By contributing and helping us reach our rehab goal for the Urban Studios, you will help create spaces for over 25 CREATIVE ENTREPRENEURS from this community and surrounding communities

Where Will Your Investments Go

The space we are updating is a 100 year old former theater. It was one of the first motion picture theaters in the state of Alabama called the Belle Theater.

This project will help launch the other projects. By placing creative on the block first, we will have a team of professionals to help market future expansions for the future entrepreneurs needed for other buildings.  
Whether you give as little of $1 or you are able to give the full amount for all renovations of this building and others, we will use your contributions to renovate this block and improve this community. We hope you contribute.

<h3>The Cause</h3>
<p>On May 25th, 2020 George Floyd was murdered by an officer who kneeled on his neck for eight minutes and forty six seconds while George begged for his life. As a mother and human being it broke my heart to watch a grown man call for his mama in his final moments as we all watched helplessly. This death is just one in a long sad history of police brutality and misconduct with no accountability. I felt trapped in the face of this tragedy, unable to attend protest myself I have been searching for a way to add my voice to the cause and make a meaningful impact on society. As an artist I was inspired to channel some of this collective grief and rage we are all feeling into a memorial piece for George Floyd, version one titled ‘8:46’, and version two titled ‘Justice for George’, creating a lasting symbol of a man who moved a nation. I’m creating a high quality 12x12 print at an incedibly low price, of which all the profits will go towards the Southern Alamance Chapter of NAACP in North Carolina.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Before I was born, my father made his living in the Philippines producing stunning batiks - an ancient and lengthy process of painting onto cloth using wax and dyes. His growing success as an artist back in the 70's was rudely interrupted by the arrival of first my sister, and then me. He didn't paint another thing until finally upon his retirement he had the opportunity to return to the Philippines, where my beautiful mother, Chita, and extended family are from, to continue his love of batiks.</p>
<p>Dad had hoped to sell his paintings not only to make a living, but also to support local communities in need, having seen first-hand the devastation and despair after Typhoon Hainan hit our home village in 2013.  He didn't work alone, he had help from a number of my cousins, who he had hoped to train up in order to support themselves and their families long after he was gone. Sadly his vision was never achieved when he passed away unexpectedly just six months after starting the business. My cousins did not feel able to continue on without him so for the last few years, I have sat with a room full of his original paintings, wanting to share them with the world, but unable to part with them. (That's me below!)</p>

I also had to consider that a lot of the originals are huge, and would probably be too big for most urban living spaces, thus the idea of Batiki was born. A future range of over 50 batik designs as prints, cushions, fashion and wall art.</p>
<p>I have been very slowly building Batiki with my own limited funding, but a lot of the products I would like to manufacture, such as cushions, scarves and full size screen prints are out of reach this early in the process.  I'd love to launch the company properly so that I can print onto the best quality materials, whilst maintaining an eco-friendly and sustainable approach to our papers and fabrics.</p>
<p>Hopefully you like my Dad's art as much as I do (even though I'm obviously biased) and any support is appreciated! The average sizes of the original batiks are shown below with our stunning model Giada - who in another life and time would have been my Dad's Granddaughter-in-law. She's still family to me. </p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Future Plans</h3>
<p>I'm hoping to raise £5,000 to create the first run of merchandise, ideally all in time for Christmas. This will include greeting cards, framed prints and cushions as a starting point. Currently the majority of our prints can only go up to approx A3 as the process to digitise them at full size is very costly. One of the first things I'll do with the funds after all perks have been fulfilled will be to digitise the paintings so that I can reproduce them as screen prints on cloth so that they can be enjoyed similar to the originals.</p>
<p>Eventually where possible, all products will be manufactured on eco-friendly, sustainable and vegan materials, for example I'm very excited to use vegan suede for the cushions, which are not only animal friendly, they are also  incredibly soft to touch and very comfy!</p>
<p>Our Perks include:</p>
<p>- A6 Mounted Prints in 8""x 10"" Frame (Choice of 3 designs)</p>
<p>- Pack of 6 Greetings Cards</p>
<p>- Framed A3 Giclee Prints (Choice of 3 designs)</p>
<p>- Vegan Suede Cushions (Choice of 4 designs)</p>
<p>- A2 Giclee Prints (Unframed - Choice of 2 designs)</p>
<p>- Limited Edition 'Ziggy' Screen Print with Certificate of Authenticity</p>
<p>- Two of my Dad's Original Batiks </p>

<h3>My Personal Mission</h3>
<p>I'm not so naive as to think that launching, building and sustaining a business is easy work, but I have the passion and drive, not to mention a lifetime of sales experience! Also, whilst I'm not trying to change the world here, I'd like to think I can try to make a difference somewhere. Just as Dad wanted to use his art to try and help support those in need - if I can make a success of this, then I would like to honour his wishes and find ways to use Batiki to give back to our communities in anyway I can. The first on my list will be New Horizon Youth Centre in Camden, London, an incredible haven for young homeless people. I've seen first-hand the amazing work that the charity does, and so even if you don't feel inclined to support this campaign, please take a moment to check out what they do and if you can spare a pound or two, consider donating to them instead. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Team</h3>
<p>I may for all intents and purposes be a 'One Man Band' in terms of setting Batiki up, but I wouldn't be where I am without the love, input and support from so many people. Firstly my Dad and my cousins who have created these amazing batiks; my mother who has supported the entire family on both sides of the world through thick and thin, and probably saved us from ourselves many times over; my husband whose unwavering belief knows no end (and hopefully his art contacts won't hurt!) and my wonderful, oh so loyal friends who have seen me through the best and the worst of times, more than once. Hopefully you guys will fill the remaining vacancy within the team as supporters, investors or simply fans. Any financial, emotional or business support would be gratefully received.</p>

</div></div>","Our Story
Before I was born, my father made his living in the Philippines producing stunning batiks - an ancient and lengthy process of painting onto cloth using wax and dyes. His growing success as an artist back in the 70's was rudely interrupted by the arrival of first my sister, and then me. He didn't paint another thing until finally upon his retirement he had the opportunity to return to the Philippines, where my beautiful mother, Chita, and extended family are from, to continue his love of batiks.
Dad had hoped to sell his paintings not only to make a living, but also to support local communities in need, having seen first-hand the devastation and despair after Typhoon Hainan hit our home village in 2013.  He didn't work alone, he had help from a number of my cousins, who he had hoped to train up in order to support themselves and their families long after he was gone. Sadly his vision was never achieved when he passed away unexpectedly just six months after starting the business. My cousins did not feel able to continue on without him so for the last few years, I have sat with a room full of his original paintings, wanting to share them with the world, but unable to part with them. (That's me below!)

<p>For those of you who don't know me, I have been an industry professional for 12+ years, working on projects like Samson, Monomyth, the MEG, and others. I’ve always wanted to create my own content when it comes to comics. Since I started drawing, I’ve always wanted to create my own stories and my own characters to dawn the pages of comic books!</p>
<p>With the decline of current titles and publishers turning our most beloved characters into villains and politically correct heroes, the time is ripe for independent creators to take to the shelves and revive this declining medium! As a fan of the 90’s and as an artist who has been inspired by that blooming era, I want to introduce a book that will give readers – longing for good content , and the flare of those 90’s books- hope again. Books my kids can read and that they can get excited about.</p>
<p>By supporting this campaign not only will you be getting a sweet book of classic 90's characters and top notch art, but you'll also be helping me jump-start my ultimate goal of writing, penciling, and inking my own book series called Shadow Sentry. <strong>Shadow Sentry</strong> is an X-Men meets the Matrix superhero comic that is classic Good vs. Evil, with a Supernatural twist. It will bring back that awesome 90's vibe of great characters and that creator owned passion that made the 90's what it was. In the INKtober book backers will get an exclusive sneak peak at 10 of my Shadow Sentry characters.</p>
<p>This campaign will give backers a lot of options for supporting... and it's going to have flexible funding, so backers will get what they order even if I'm not able to get to that 4k goal...</p>
<p><strong><i>But as an added incentive to get there... if we can make it to 4k <u>I will SIGN everything </u>before it ships! So let's get there!</i></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can get just the INKtober ashcan book; a sketchcover variant; or an original piece of art from the book along with the regular INKtober book.</li>
<li>You also have the option of getting your hands on books that Eric has worked on in the past, like Monomyth; Samson; The Art of Eric Ninaltowski; and The Hand of the Morningstar! Check out more info on those in the ADD ONs section below*</li>

<h3> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Details</h3>
<p><strong>Let's get specific:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>INKtober 2018 collects all 31 illustrations from the popular artists challenge from the month of October. You'll see some of your favorites from 90's comics from Image, Marvel, and DC. You'll also be getting a look at some characters of my own creation for my new and upcoming comic series called: SHADOW SENTRY.</li>
<li>The INKtober book is a 8.5""x 5.5"" book, in an Ashcan format, typical convention lingo.</li>
<li>The characters in the book are as follows... Grifter, Spartan, Zealot, Warblade, Maul, Voodoo, Jacob Marlowe and Void, Helspont, Pike (Yes... pretty much all of the WildCATS!), Caitlin Fairchild, Grunge, Deathblow, Omega Red, Stryker (from Cyberforce), Mr. Majestic, Union, Savage Dragon, Spawn, Batman, Diehard (from youngblood), and Weapon X.... From the Shadow Sentry... Brazen, The Angel Vangeleon, Gannon, Noble, Cogent, Glare, Deacon, Blood Bane, Vengent, and Hopscotch. - If you're going to get an original piece of art from the book, you'll need to know who is in there! ;)</li>
<li>Printing cost is $5/INKtober book, it might cost a little more but I'll be using a local small business that I know and trust, so printing will be quicker. The other books I already have printed and on hand, that's why I only have limited quantities available for those ADD ON perks. </li>
<li>
<i><strong>Why I need your help and partnership!</strong></i><p>As with any endeavor, there is always a need for capital to get it going. After I finish the current comic project I’m working on for a client, my goal is to start working on Shadow Sentry more full-time and prepare for that launch. So with this campaign I’m hoping to raise enough funds to provide a buffer and allow me the time and money to get that started and not have to work on other things during that period that would require my time and energy. So I would greatly appreciate your support and consideration, as I ask you to partner with me as I get things rolling and as I seek to create comics once again that fuel the fire, scratch the itch, and inspire once again!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550125530/kgywocwud4bnn8040u5e.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>This project really took on a mind of it’s own</strong></i> and you’ll see the illustrations become more complex as they go, and just get better and better. I even started adding some color with Deathblow, (you have to add the red on his face!) and then continued adding some red color here and there to accentuate some characters. But the crown of this book is the Shadow Sentry characters (In my humble opinion!) My goal is for you to take a look back, but also take a look forward at what is to come, and my hope is that you will get as excited as I am!</p>
<p> </p>

<p>You'll be getting a sneak peek at 10 of my characters I've created for my SHADOW SENTRY series, as well as the full colored team pic to really showcase the core team and get you excited for more. Also in the book you'll see other villains like Blood Bane, Hopscotch, Vengent, and the elite government operative part of the XI-Hunters: Deacon. I can't tell you how excited I am to get these character in front of you and get you pumped for what's to come!</p>

<h3>Stretch GOALS!</h3>
<p><strong>Here are some cool things I'd like to offer if I hit these milestones!</strong></p>

<p><i><strong>15k Stretch Goal</strong></i>- Shadow Sentry Trading Cards!</p>

You'll be helping me in a tremendous way, and help me get a jump start on my passion project and bring you the comics you deserve! Plus- you'll be helping a local printer earn some bucks, because I'm going with a local, small, mom n pop shop for my printing, sure it'll cost more, but I want to help the little guy like me.

You also have the option of getting your hands on books that Eric has worked on in the past, like Monomyth; Samson; The Art of Eric Ninaltowski; and The Hand of the Morningstar! Check out more info on those in the ADD ONs section below*

 


 
The Details
Let's get specific:

INKtober 2018 collects all 31 illustrations from the popular artists challenge from the month of October. You'll see some of your favorites from 90's comics from Image, Marvel, and DC. You'll also be getting a look at some characters of my own creation for my new and upcoming comic series called: SHADOW SENTRY.
The INKtober book is a 8.5""x 5.5"" book, in an Ashcan format, typical convention lingo.
The characters in the book are as follows... Grifter, Spartan, Zealot, Warblade, Maul, Voodoo, Jacob Marlowe and Void, Helspont, Pike (Yes... pretty much all of the WildCATS!), Caitlin Fairchild, Grunge, Deathblow, Omega Red, Stryker (from Cyberforce), Mr. Majestic, Union, Savage Dragon, Spawn, Batman, Diehard (from youngblood), and Weapon X.... From the Shadow Sentry... Brazen, The Angel Vangeleon, Gannon, Noble, Cogent, Glare, Deacon, Blood Bane, Vengent, and Hopscotch. - If you're going to get an original piece of art from the book, you'll need to know who is in there! ;)
Printing cost is $5/INKtober book, it might cost a little more but I'll be using a local small business that I know and trust, so printing will be quicker. The other books I already have printed and on hand, that's why I only have limited quantities available for those ADD ON perks. 

Why I need your help and partnership!As with any endeavor, there is always a need for capital to get it going. After I finish the current comic project I’m working on for a client, my goal is to start working on Shadow Sentry more full-time and prepare for that launch. So with this campaign I’m hoping to raise enough funds to provide a buffer and allow me the time and money to get that started and not have to work on other things during that period that would require my time and energy. So I would greatly appreciate your support and consideration, as I ask you to partner with me as I get things rolling and as I seek to create comics once again that fuel the fire, scratch the itch, and inspire once again!


 

 
This project really took on a mind of it’s own and you’ll see the illustrations become more complex as they go, and just get better and better. I even started adding some color with Deathblow, (you have to add the red on his face!) and then continued adding some red color here and there to accentuate some characters. But the crown of this book is the Shadow Sentry characters (In my humble opinion!) My goal is for you to take a look back, but also take a look forward at what is to come, and my hope is that you will get as excited as I am!
 



You'll be getting a sneak peek at 10 of my characters I've created for my SHADOW SENTRY series, as well as the full colored team pic to really showcase the core team and get you excited for more. Also in the book you'll see other villains like Blood Bane, Hopscotch, Vengent, and the elite government operative part of the XI-Hunters: Deacon. I can't tell you how excited I am to get these character in front of you and get you pumped for what's to come!

ADD ONs
You'll also be able to add on some of these cool books that Eric has also done... here's a brief run down of each so you know what you're getting.

The Art of Eric Ninaltowski Ashcan - in full color - Pictured above with Lion-o on the cover this book is an 8.5"" x 5.5"" 16 pg. book with select illustrations that Eric has done, like the Thundercats, Deadpool, Wonder Woman, Deathstroke, Captain America and others.
The Art of Eric Ninaltowski Vol. 1 - Black & White - White Captain America and Batman on the cover is a 45 pg. 8.5"" x 11"" book that features a wonderful look into the behind the scenes and process of Eric's work. Over 100 images from sketches to fully inked illustrations this book has a little bit of everything and is perfect for the admirer of the arts.
Monomyth tpb - Collecting 3 issues of the series from OSSM comics, written by Siike Donnelly, illustrated by Eric, and colored by Peejay Catacutan. What if Adam and Eve never ate the apple? What if it was Michael who revolted and not Lucifer? Follow Enoch on an epic tale to save Eden from the evils of the other Devil! 90 pages, plus 6 extra pages added just for the tpb, and also featuring a sketch book of Eric's work developing the look and feel of the characters.
Samson Volumes 1 & 2 - presented by Rooted Chronicles- Take an in depth look at one of the most well known characters in the Bible: Samson. Volume one, features art from the talents of Nadir Balan, and colors by the stunning Liz Buenaventura, written by Luis Serrano. Volume two, has two chapters, the first with art by the talented Mike Abuan, and I follow up with the most intense part of the story... the slaying of the 1,000 Philistines!
Hand of the Morningstar- 2 enormous tomes collecting 8 volumes and 1,200 pages of story and art. Since there are only 2 available they will be offered as one huge package! HOTM showcases Eric's first published work from 2008-2011 on 6 of the 8 volumes. The first two volumes were done by none other than Mike Miller, who also supplied some writing. ""In the battle between good and evil, it's hard to tell who's on which side. With the world watching, the opposing forces of super powered beings clash in battles that reveal whether the Morningstar fights for the cause of good.... or evil."" These books were originally published by Zondervan and Lamp Post Publications, and created by Brett Burner. The books will also be signed by Eric, Mike Miller, and Brett Burner! Check out this video!*

Risks & Challenges
More like Pluses and more Pluses! 
The Risks on this endeavor are low- Challenges... low! But the Pluses are enormous! You'll be helping me in a tremendous way, and help me get a jump start on my passion project and bring you the comics you deserve! Plus- you'll be helping a local printer earn some bucks, because I'm going with a local, small, mom n pop shop for my printing, sure it'll cost more, but I want to help the little guy like me. Plus- it means turnaround will be quicker, PLUS- I can ensure every book looks good before I accept it! Win, Win!


Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help!

If you can't contribute with the money, don't sweat it, you can help by just telling people what I'm doing! Help me get the word out to all those people you know who like cool art and love comics!

<p><strong>ONE ARRT -PROJECT SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>As an artist, I have always depended on the common “art store” to purchase my art materials and supplies. The most common supplies are acrylic or oil paint, gel mediums, brushes, color pencils, charcoal, and canvas. Without even thinking about it, I personally would walk down the aisle of the art store and grab the art supplies that were within my budget. If I had a bit more to spend, I would treat myself to a higher end item. As an artist, you may find yourself having to purchase art supplies repeatedly and then you realize that<strong> sometimes you are <i>buying</i> products more than selling artwork. </strong>As artists, we are resourceful and can create with pretty much anything but regardless, <strong>options are always a plus! That's where ONE ARRT comes in!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Artist/Founder of ONE ARRT- Rebecca Robinson</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p>During my career as a professional artist, I always had a love for the creative process. During that process, I had to learn how to hone my craft, create a budget for the supplies I needed to create original artwork and last but not least, brand myself. <strong>One of the challenges of my personal art journey was obtaining the proper resources to build a strong platform which in turn would be fulfilling, inspirational to other aspiring artists and lucrative.</strong> Being able to do what you love and make a living doing so is possible!!</p>

<p><strong>THE ONE ARRT</strong> <strong>MISSION</strong> <strong>gives a percentage of profits (after all business expenses are paid) directly to specific educational programs, community projects, privately owned art galleries and museums that focus on the growth and a<u>dvancement of ALL artists </u>including fine art, performing arts and visual arts. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Rebecca recognized something was missing in the typical art supply store. There were always art products and supplies, but there weren't any brands that <u>specifically</u> helped the smaller organizations or groups in small towns or cities that are in need.  </strong></p>

<p><i> <strong>“It was a win-win situation. I have always enjoyed browsing the aisles in art supply stores, seeing new products and being excited when my favorite supplies were on sale. Art supplies are expensive. and it is also an investment. It would give me a sense of pride to buy an art product that contributes towards smaller art programs and community projects throughout the county. I have always made it a priority to give back and ONE ARRT will definitely change the way people shop for art supplies""  - </strong>Rebecca</i></p>

</div></div>","ONE ARRT believes if we can work together for a bigger purpose, ONE ARRT will reach the goal to be the 1st art supply brand to contribute towards smaller art groups and organizations that nurture and support all creative people.
 
With every ONE ARRT product order- You are contributing towards making a difference in your ART community!
 
1. Several art organizations/small groups go unnoticed and unfunded because of lack
of support. ONE ARRT plans to change that.
2. Smaller communities deserve to have access to the arts, including
workshops and classes.

ONE ARRT -PROJECT SUMMARY
As an artist, I have always depended on the common “art store” to purchase my art materials and supplies. The most common supplies are acrylic or oil paint, gel mediums, brushes, color pencils, charcoal, and canvas. Without even thinking about it, I personally would walk down the aisle of the art store and grab the art supplies that were within my budget. If I had a bit more to spend, I would treat myself to a higher end item. As an artist, you may find yourself having to purchase art supplies repeatedly and then you realize that sometimes you are buying products more than selling artwork. As artists, we are resourceful and can create with pretty much anything but regardless, options are always a plus! That's where ONE ARRT comes in!
Artist/Founder of ONE ARRT- Rebecca Robinson
 

 
During my career as a professional artist, I always had a love for the creative process. During that process, I had to learn how to hone my craft, create a budget for the supplies I needed to create original artwork and last but not least, brand myself. One of the challenges of my personal art journey was obtaining the proper resources to build a strong platform which in turn would be fulfilling, inspirational to other aspiring artists and lucrative. Being able to do what you love and make a living doing so is possible!!
 
THE ONE ARRT MISSION gives a percentage of profits (after all business expenses are paid) directly to specific educational programs, community projects, privately owned art galleries and museums that focus on the growth and advancement of ALL artists including fine art, performing arts and visual arts. 
ONE ARRT'S goal is to reach as many small groups and art organizations as possible around the country who need our help!

ABOUT ARTIST REBECCA ROBINSON (aRRt)
If you didn't notice, the name of the art brand is ONE ARRT with two R's in the word ""Art"" which represents artist Rebecca Robinson's initials. 
Rebecca recognized something was missing in the typical art supply store. There were always art products and supplies, but there weren't any brands that specifically helped the smaller organizations or groups in small towns or cities that are in need.  
ONE ARRT IS ON A MISSION TO FIND ART ORGANIZATIONS/GROUPS THAT ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE AND NEED OUR HELP!

 “It was a win-win situation. I have always enjoyed browsing the aisles in art supply stores, seeing new products and being excited when my favorite supplies were on sale. Art supplies are expensive. and it is also an investment. It would give me a sense of pride to buy an art product that contributes towards smaller art programs and community projects throughout the county. I have always made it a priority to give back and ONE ARRT will definitely change the way people shop for art supplies""  - Rebecca

</div><p> </p><p>This campaign and campaign video was made by ANNIE WOO- IG: @woohooannie</p></div>","It all started with KTOWN WALLZ PROJECT
About ten years ago, ESPY DPT started the KTOWN WALLZ PROJECT, bringing in artists from all walks of life to paint and beautify my neighborhood. With the permission of the neighbors and local business owners, we have been able to grow and expand to over 200+ walls throughout. Today, our walls are adorned with the works of both notable and up-and-coming international graffiti, streetart, and mural artists.
Our project has helped

Keeping the neighborhood safe
Increasing property values
Beautifying the neighborhood and overall quality of life

 
 

THE IMPACT

DISCLOSURE: Risks & Challenges
This is our second LA Meeting of Styles and everything is organized by ESPY alone and SOME help from the community. While we will try to be on top of everything and be as professional as possible, please understand that we may not get to everyone's inquiries right away, due to limited staffing. We are NOT getting paid for the event. The campaign will only cover basic costs. Our film/documentation crew are mostly donating their time but your donation will help them get fed and help pay for their equipments.

While we hope to be able to meet our funding goal (which includes 5% fee to Indiegogo), we know there is a possibility that we may not get there. If this is the case, whatever funds we do get will go into all the top priorities. We MAY run into the risk of not being able to provide as many sinks and porta potties as we'd like. However, the perks you have claimed will 100% percent go to you, no matter what the outcome of our campaign!

<p>2019 will mark the 50th anniversary of one of the most monumental events in the history of mankind - The Apollo 11 Project - the first landing of humans on the moon. <i>This campaign is a celebration of that accomplishment. </i></p>
<p>In 1967, two years before the first man set foot on the moon, NASA had charted the entire route that the command module ""Columbia"" and the landing module ""Eagle"" would make on its journey from earth to the moon and back home again and released it as a poster. <strong>This chart has now been fully restored, recolored, and - thanks to the support of backers like you - will be launched as a special reissue this spring! </strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517955458/cy0x1b5lt1qdhdkd9p33.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>

<p>On July 20, 1969, two American astronauts ( Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin ) became the first men to step foot on the moon. It was a dream and a challenge set forth by one man, President John F. Kennedy, when he declared in May of 1961 : </p>
<p><strong>""I believe this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to earth.""</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517954012/nm98jzobawhlkbct97vu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>It took years of planning and the work of thousands of people to accomplish this task but on July 16th the massive Saturn V rocket lifted off from NASA's Kennedy Space Center carrying three astronauts on their mission to the moon.</p>
<p><strong>""All this is possible only through the blood, sweat, and tears of a number of people</strong><strong>....</strong><strong> All you see [are] the three of us, but beneath the surface are thousands and thousands of others.""</strong></p>
<p>                                          <i>   - Apollo 11 astronaut Michael Collins</i></p>

<p>Thousands of people across America and the world watched in anticipation, and all those years of planning culminated in celebration on that exciting day.</p>
<p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517954099/wkxv8g7swszerd07iqti.jpg"" src=""""/></i></p>

<p>The Apollo 11 Lunar Landing Chart proves how well planned out the project was even two years prior to when the Saturn V launched the capsule into space. Stages of the launch, orbit, descent, and return were precisely calculated...and those who owned this chart at the time could have followed along with the astronauts on every leg of the journey. </p>
<p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517954189/zfcffbxtmibcwtzd24ap.jpg"" src=""""/></i></p>
<p>This chart is a wonderful paper souvenir of one of the most glorious events in humankind and yet very few people own it. Hopefully, with the reissuing of this chart, that will change. </p>
<p>I have fully restored this original lunar landing chart, bringing out the deep blacks of outer space, and the details of the capsule drawings. Then I changed the hues of the earth and moon ( to give it that added sci-fi punch ) and colored the text and lines, adding plenty of ""stars"" too. </p>
<p>A fifty-year-old chart given new life.....<strong>it deserves it. </strong></p>
<p><i> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517954277/dvf2w1xsdkuuwmz2tnaz.jpg"" src=""""/></i></p>
<p>This reissue of <strong>The Apollo 11 Lunar Landing Chart </strong>will measure 1' x 3' ( 12"" x 36""/30cm x 92cm ). It will be printed on 80lb glossy cover stock with a UV coating and feature a 1/4"" border - in black - so it will be easy to frame. The title block will also be printed in metallic ink to really commemorate the occasion. This is a standard U.S. panorama frame size as well, so pre-made frames can easily be purchased. </p>

<p><strong>THE STICKER SET - $5</strong></p>
<p><strong>One 4"" circular sticker featuring the original artwork</strong> <strong>from the Apollo 11 mission patch.</strong> The astronauts had wanted the image on the patch to be symbolic so they chose a bald eagle with its ""landing gear"" extended. The eagle is a proud symbol of the United States but it was also the name of the lunar module.

<p>I'd like to thank NASA for generously providing images of the Apollo 11 project and special thanks to all of the men and women involved in the various Apollo projects from its beginning in 1966. This independent project is not endorsed nor affiliated with NASA in any way. </p>
</div></div>","2019 will mark the 50th anniversary of one of the most monumental events in the history of mankind - The Apollo 11 Project - the first landing of humans on the moon. This campaign is a celebration of that accomplishment. 
In 1967, two years before the first man set foot on the moon, NASA had charted the entire route that the command module ""Columbia"" and the landing module ""Eagle"" would make on its journey from earth to the moon and back home again and released it as a poster. This chart has now been fully restored, recolored, and - thanks to the support of backers like you - will be launched as a special reissue this spring! 


On July 20, 1969, two American astronauts ( Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin ) became the first men to step foot on the moon. It was a dream and a challenge set forth by one man, President John F. Kennedy, when he declared in May of 1961 : 
""I believe this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to earth.""

It took years of planning and the work of thousands of people to accomplish this task but on July 16th the massive Saturn V rocket lifted off from NASA's Kennedy Space Center carrying three astronauts on their mission to the moon.
""All this is possible only through the blood, sweat, and tears of a number of people.... All you see [are] the three of us, but beneath the surface are thousands and thousands of others.""
                                             - Apollo 11 astronaut Michael Collins

Thousands of people across America and the world watched in anticipation, and all those years of planning culminated in celebration on that exciting day.


The Apollo 11 Lunar Landing Chart proves how well planned out the project was even two years prior to when the Saturn V launched the capsule into space. Stages of the launch, orbit, descent, and return were precisely calculated...and those who owned this chart at the time could have followed along with the astronauts on every leg of the journey. 

This chart is a wonderful paper souvenir of one of the most glorious events in humankind and yet very few people own it. Hopefully, with the reissuing of this chart, that will change. 
I have fully restored this original lunar landing chart, bringing out the deep blacks of outer space, and the details of the capsule drawings. Then I changed the hues of the earth and moon ( to give it that added sci-fi punch ) and colored the text and lines, adding plenty of ""stars"" too. 
A fifty-year-old chart given new life.....it deserves it. 
 
This reissue of The Apollo 11 Lunar Landing Chart will measure 1' x 3' ( 12"" x 36""/30cm x 92cm ). It will be printed on 80lb glossy cover stock with a UV coating and feature a 1/4"" border - in black - so it will be easy to frame. The title block will also be printed in metallic ink to really commemorate the occasion. This is a standard U.S. panorama frame size as well, so pre-made frames can easily be purchased. 


Simple rewards for a humble, but worthy, project......

THE STICKER SET - $5
One 4"" circular sticker featuring the original artwork from the Apollo 11 mission patch. The astronauts had wanted the image on the patch to be symbolic so they chose a bald eagle with its ""landing gear"" extended. The eagle is a proud symbol of the United States but it was also the name of the lunar module. To symbolize the peaceful nature of the mission, the eagle is carrying an olive branch - the symbol of peace. 
Also, included will be two 3"" x 6"" stickers of the original Apollo 11 logo. 

THE APOLLO 11 LUNAR LANDING CHART - $30
One Apollo 11 Lunar Landing Chart + the sticker set. This is what this project is all about. It measures 12"" x 36"" ( 30cm x 92cm ) and will come shipped rolled in a tube. As a bonus, you'll also receive all of the stickers! 

THE APOLLO 11 LUNAR LANDING CHART X2 - $50 
Two ( 2 ) Apollo 11 Lunar Landing Charts + two ( 2 ) sticker sets. Double the charts, double the stickers! 

While this project is listed under my name - Constance Metzinger - it will actually be a joint effort by my sister, Diana, and myself. I enjoy the restoration work, all design aspects of the project, and handling ""customer service"" while Diana takes care of packaging duties.

Arts Jam doesn't have a lot of risks, other than the weather!  Even a rainy day won't stop us, because we have lots of indoor venues we can move to in case of a few drops.  Every bit of support - even if we don't make our goal - will go to making this a great day!    Ways You Can Help
 So give as generously as you can - even if it is just $1, we appreciate your support.  And if you can't give money, help us to get the word out and share with your friends using Indiegogo share tools, Facebook, Twitter and other social media.    And we LOVE to get volunteers - visit our website at www.chardonartsjam.org for more information about how to get involved!  THANKS!!!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

The three pillars of vibrant community development are Identity, Sustainability and Mobility.  Identity represents a community’s historic and present day character.

It symbolizes good wealth, health and riches. During the Lunar New Year, Chinese families would paste this symbol on anything imaginable to bring goodness: walls, doors, food containers and even fruits for prayers!

Who am I ?

My name is Sharath A Haridaasan and I'm a 38 year old artist, writer and filmmaker living in Kerala, India. I have enjoyed a successful career writing, directing, editing and producing television commercials and music videos for the better part of 13 years. My passion is to promote oriental art by struggling artists and give them avenues to gain exposure and recognition. My sister Saranya Haridasan herself is an accomplished oriental fine artist, who shares my love for promoting oriental fine art and artists.You can see some of our work below:


Whats my campaign about ?

 I started this campaign to raise funds to set up an online gallery for oriental art and represent little known artists. I am halfway through it but pressed for funds now. Need to get it completed by June 1st. So I thought of seeking your help in raising funds while you get in return some of our best oriental fine art prints and related products produced with the help of a top quality print production facility in the US.
    What I need ? 
I need a $15000 in order to complete my project.  
Here's a breakdown:




IndieGogo fees (9% if I don't meet my goal, 4% if I do), Paypal fees (3%) and Credit Cards (3%) 


Cost of fulfilling perks (canvas prints, other products) form a large portion of the amount I am asking for)


My taxes


If I meet my goal, any extra funds will be used to expand the online gallery and improve its security.
  Your Perks ! 
This is why you're here!  Some of our best oriental art prints on matte finished canvas are here for you to choose from.Unfortunately Indiegogo doesn't allow add-ons or combining perks, so you will have to make separate contributions for each perk you would like.  Very sorry about the inconvenience! Cell Phone Cases with Powerful Chinese Symbol of Good Fortune -$50

</div></div>","""Light of Hope"" NO PEACE NO BOOM 2015/16  Tour




A sequel to “NO PEACE NO BOOM” collection created by Michael Punchman at the turn of the millennium, the show will further exploit the integration of art and digital technology.  A collection of colorful fiberglass sculptures created a surprise alluding to the atrocities of modern civilization. These objects conjure a virtual experience that is overt but intriguing, instantly leading the audience to ponder.  








No peace no boom is our motto, and our blessing for fellow global citizens. At the core of our ""Light of Hope"" 2015/16 Tour, a new born talisman,“Fu | 符”, dispels bad luck and energizes the spirit for rebound. Original and new pieces  are augmented with digital compositions, engrossing the audience in a hyperreality for contemplation.   
What is our Goal?





We believe optimism is contagious and we want to create an epidemic of NO PEACE NO BOOM, a perpetual force for rebound. And you will be a part of our show. We invite you to be our harbinger.  Send us your wishes  and they will become part of the digital installation. 
We will develop a NO PEACE NO BOOM digital talisman, sharable on most mobile devices, as a daily reminder of wishful thinking and optimism. We are set to roll out the Tour in the last quarter of this year, starting in Asia.
What is the money going to do?
- $100k : first show completes  (Hong Kong or Beijing) 
- $150k: 2 shows in Asia complete plus new pieces and perks
- $250k : 1 show in US completes  
- $300k : 1 show in Europe completes




NO PEACE NO BOOM Origin





In year 2000, Michael Punchman set about creating a collection of sculptures that served no function other than to bring hope to this world. He took two of the most devastating and disturbing images as his inspiration: the atomic explosions in Japan and the explosion of the Twin Towers in New York.  







The NO PEACE NO BOOM collection is inherently contradicting.  Shiny surfaces and the vibrant bubble-gum colour transmits a potency which the imagery of the object is supposed to condemn. 

The collection has been previously exhibited in Japan, France and Hong Kong. Most of the audience experienced the journey from horror to hope: frightened, and then feeling intrigued, to walking away with hope.


Find out more on what media said 


World Tour and ""Fu | 符"" (The Talismans)

Fu | 符 is a Chinese script and graphic representation of a charm blessing, destined to protect its bearer from disasters and exorcise evil influence. Its efficacy is bestowed by the charmer who scriptes the composition. 


Disregard the superstition and its efficacy, the composition is a great work of art. The formation of characters and symbols carry rich meanings in natural science, astrology, history and other disciplines.  
“In the name of NPNB, we command peace to boom” is the marching order of this talisman. The digital projection will feature multi-lingual creative compositions by Michael Punchman. 



We'd Like to Thank Your Support By Giving Youa piece of NO PEACE NO BOOM



Send us a line of optimism!! Backers' names and wishes will be part of the projection in the show. Most of you will get multiple perks including these collectable items. 




Limited download of digital talisman


Limited offer on talisman drawings

<p><b>ARTS ON MAIN</b></p>
<p><b>CAMPAIGN SUMMARY</b></p>
<p>ArtWalk producer and veteran arts advocate Steve Gruber has
engaged and promoted dozens of artists from Michiana’s surprisingly large and
varied artist community.  </p>
<p>The need for a year-round resource to showcase and
nurture artistic local talent became apparent through Steve’s work in producing
the successful ArtWalk series for Downtown Elkhart, Inc., a 501 (c) (3)
non-profit community development corporation.  This work is enjoyed by all ages.</p>
<p><b>CONCEPT</b></p>
<p>Arts on Main opened in May 2014 as a project of Downtown Elkhart,
Inc. (with a small grant from the Elkhart County Community Foundation) to offer
a consistent, compelling and high-profile venue for:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First-class gallery space where local artists can
show and sell their work</p></li>
<li><p>Studio space to create art, to instruct others.</p></li>
<li>
<p>An art-filled venue for special events and for
music performances.</p>
<p><b>GROWTH</b></p>
<p>In just one year, Arts on Main has ignited a growing arts
scene that has  strengthened downtown's entertainment offerings with a lively street-level arts presence.  The public response has been great.  Art is selling and new exhibitions are being launched
every 6 to 8 weeks.</p>
<p><b>CHALLENGES</b></p>
<p>To maximize sales income for artists, we assess only 25%
commission (vs. the typical 50% for most galleries).  We have smartly used social media, but
boosting and promoting have inherent costs we have to meet in order to
grow.  </p>
<p><b>WHY SUPPORT US</b></p>
<p>Art sales have been brisk; however, after rent, utilities
and insurance expenses are paid, it’s a challenge to fund the costs of mounting
and marketing art shows and music events to introduce more talent.</p>
<p><b>ALL ABOUT YOU</b></p>
<p>You are a fundamental driver in helping to raise the
profile of local arts, in a really cool setting.  Your contribution is 100% eligible for

<p>We seek to <b>maximize local artist visibility</b>with prudent local advertising tools and

His hope was to expand awareness for a clean, intelligent, family hobby and for the unseen curiosities lurking right beneath your own two feet. Our first proposal was a formal 3D HD documentary about mineralogy. On our second attempt, we switched gears and tried a ""humor and gags"" video series instead.

Field researchers abroad are often forced to rely on expensive tourist industry services, which exhaust their budgets. Instead, Biowanders would create sustainably built research facilities in regions around the world, provided at minimal cost to science, while recycling any revenues into targeted conservation of the most endangered habitats in the world.

Earn stuff. So simple.   The Full Explanation and Project Goal:I tried twice to crowdfund educational videos about mineralogy with my father, Henry, a mineralogist and educator. He was a friendly, jovial, enlightened man and a foremost guru on the fascinating world of minerals. The mineral barwoodite was recently named for him. He loved sharing his knowledge with anybody. His hope was to expand awareness for a clean, intelligent, family hobby and for the unseen curiosities lurking right beneath your own two feet. Our first proposal was a formal 3D HD documentary about mineralogy. On our second attempt, we switched gears and tried a ""humor and gags"" video series instead. Unfortunately neither project was successful. My father died very suddenly in 2016 during a simple outpatient medical procedure. I lost my friend, my hero, my mineral collecting buddy, and the world lost an opportunity to preserve his wonderful knowledge and discoveries.Old campaign image from 2012I also tried on three occasions to crowdfund a campaign called Biowanders. At the time, one of the world's most endangered littoral forests had just been bulldozed to the ground. I started thinking about ways to fund targeted conservation projects in perpetuity. After learning the frustrations of some stranded biology graduate researchers and their budget-busted professor, my wife and I came up with the idea for Biowanders. Field researchers abroad are often forced to rely on expensive tourist industry services, which exhaust their budgets. Instead, Biowanders would create sustainably built research facilities in regions around the world, provided at minimal cost to science, while recycling any revenues into targeted conservation of the most endangered habitats in the world. They would have been a win for everybody. Unfortunately none of the projects were successful. They just didn't seem to garner enough attention.Old campaign image from 2014After seeing viral nonsense like the Potato Salad crowdfunding project, I decided I was going about things all wrong. I launched a gag campaign called ""Bottled Celebrity Farts"". In the campaign I explained it was a ploy to raise funding for important scientific, nature and educational projects. The campaign was cold rejected by Kickstarter. I rebranded the novelty campaign as the Worst Crowdfunding Project in History and relaunched on Indiegogo. The project was removed for lack of a definitive goal, which I've now remedied. Most recently the project was completely removed from GoFundMe for no apparent reason at all. They deleted my campaign and my entire account.Old campaign image from 2014Finally, my wife is the most ethical person I know. She's a much needed neurobiologist in one of the foremost labs in the world for AD research. She lost her father, Ed, to early onset Alzheimer's Disease. He was just fifty-two years old. His case was used in Washington D.C. to help lobby for expanded funding for Alzheimer's patients. Ed was a mechanic, he fixed things. He taught his daughters that when something is broken, you fix it. When he got sick, my wife took it upon herself to try to fix Alzheimer's Disease. She switched majors and began churning out important research. From advocating in Washington, to volunteering with Hilarity for Charity and Alzheimer's Association, to organizing local brain bees for grade school students, to running lab experiments late into the night, my wife works tirelessly, always with the goal to prevent others from going through what her father experienced.My wife and her father, EdSo here we are. This is a legitimate art project. I will use proceeds from the campaign to frame a picture of ""Hairy Toenails"", hang it on my wall and occasionally allow friends, visiting neighbors and passing foreign dignitaries to throw darts at it. All remaining funding will be used to support the pursuit of beneficial scientific, nature and educational projects as I see fit, including educational 3D nature videos, developing a Biowander, paying down my wife's student loans, and 10% of all proceeds will be given to Hilarity for Charity, which benefits Alzheimer's Disease.To recap, your wonderful support does the following:1. Helps create a piece of art to satisfy Indiegogo's terms.2. Helps launch Stereo 3D educational videos about mineralogy and nature.3. Helps launch scientific field research stations to benefit humanity.4. Helps pay down an actual scientist's student loans.5. Helps provide 10% of proceeds to Hilarity for Charity to benefit Alzheimer's.I am a real, fairly honest, somewhat decent human being and this is a real crowdfunding campaign to produce an actual piece of art.

An invaluable service that provides a path through the chaos of a busy city, the Art Taxi is a luxury for its clients. It begins its tour at Berlin Hackescher Markt and takes its clients on an excursion of contemporary art galleries, opening a window to galleries that the average visitor would be hard pressed to visit in a short period of time. The Taxi provides an intimate platform where clients can connect and discuss the art as it is seen. The taxi, a black BMW, takes clients to as many galleries as can be reached in three hours.

ABOUT WRITING AND ART BEYOND BORDERS BEYOND WALLS
Writing and Art Beyond Borders, Beyond Walls is a journey that started two years ago behind bars. 14 European prisons, in five countries, Belgium, Poland, Serbia, Italy and Greece collaborated in putting together an ambitious project of exchanging art work and organizing different creative workshops for the inmates. The project was named PAROL. 
(for more info on parol    please visit www.parol-art.eu )

Creatief Schrijven from Belgium, ApsArt from Serbia, Cascina Macondo from Italy and Fundacja Slawek  from Poland were the N.G.O's that worked in each of the above countries to make PAROL happen.


We, the Amaka team, were responsible for running the Art Therapy workshop in Greece that ran for a year, from September 2013 until June 2014 in the Women Detention Centre of Thiva,near Athens.
By using different  Art Therapy techniques,  like video, photography and theatre, we gave to the incarcerated women  a voice to express their inner thoughts and emotions.
The results of the workshop proved  to us one more time how powerful a  tool art can be  when used as Therapy and as a mean to express suppressed feelings and emotions.
In February 24, 2015 the Art creations of the team will be exhibited for a week in a culture center, in Athens downtown, with lots of parallel events. 
But this is just the beginning....

WHAT WE ASK FROM CROWDFUNDERS

ΓΙΑ ΤΟ ΠΡΟΓΡΑΜΜΑ WRITING AND ART BEYOND BORDERS BEYOND WALLS 
To πρόγραμμα αυτό είναι ένα ταξίδι που άρχισε πριν δύο χρόνια.  14 Ευρωπαϊκές  φυλακές σε 5 χώρες, στο Βέλγιο, στην Πολωνία, στην Σερβία, στην Ιταλία και στην Ελλάδα συνεργάστηκαν για να στήσουν ένα πρόγραμμα αμοιβαίας ανταλλαγής έργων τέχνης - προϊόντων των διάφορων καλλιτεχνικών εργαστηρίων που οργανώθηκαν για τους κρατούμενους. Το πρόγραμμα ονομάστηκε PAROL.

The project is still missing key big tickets of the RV or 5th wheel and tow vehicle and at least 40 K in liquid cash.

So the project is reschedule to begin 2016.I so appreciate the 51 venues across the country that opened their doors to the Mural of America project.  Thank you!  It saddens me to delay the project.I’m very open to ideas for funding/sponsorship.

Hi I'm Doug Arnholter





I'm an artist celebrating the beauty of the BIG picture.  Over 100,000 people across the country will unite to create and sign a huge 8' x 200' paint by numbers artwork I've designed about each state and DC over the next 18 months.  


The Mural of America will be created in all 50 states and DC at art festivals, rodeos, state fairs, the Boston Marathon and celebrations across the country.  


Two pieces will be created at each event.  One will be donated to the state and the 2nd will build the Mural of America.  


The 51 pieces will unite the 4th of July weekend at the National Mall in Washington, DC creating a 400' wall celebrating each individuals contribution to the BIG picture and the joy of the cohesion of diversity.

Mural of America is a 501c3 non profit. So foundations can fund the project & all contributions are tax deductible. The Visionaries Institute of Indiana is the projects fiscal agent EIN#464063227

</div>
</div><div>
<ul>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We are just starting out in Ljubljana, Slovenia and have already encountered our first problems, particularly with acquiring the right fabrics. More specifically, with the prices and selection of material. </span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">When creating our first toys we tried with fabrics from a retail store, but it was proven to be unprofitable since the price of retail fabrics is to expensive. To be able to create unique toys and start up our business idea, we need to buy fabrics in bulk, directly from the manufacturer. Unfortunately, we are in dire need of funding considering we are just starting out and have already invested all of our savings into this project. </span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">With the received funds, we would be able to contact a wholesale seller in Italy that we have previously spoken to, and acquire the required fabrics. </span></li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Also we currently have just one expert seamstress on our team, but additional funds would enable us to hire and train one additional seamstress, to help us with the creation of Unique Plush Toys.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<div>If for whatever reason, our entire goal isn't reached, the project will still persist and the funds will still go toward the DrawYourToys project, although it will take longer to complete.  If we exceed our goal, there is a number of other amazing projects that the funding can help support (custom  bags, purses and  bedding with the motive of the children drawing sewn onto them) – there will be more updates on these as we get closer to our goal.<br/>

<br/><p></p></div>","There are many special occasions in a child's life when you want to find a unique gift. 
Our handmade custom plush toys are the perfect gift to transform imagination into a hugable stuffed animal keepsake! 

Drawing is one of the most beautiful forms of expression. Even before they learn to properly form sentences, children create cute masterpieces courtesy of their liberated imagination. Unfortunately, all kinds of the adorable characters are lost in attics and basements or just thrown away. DrawYourToys.com gives parents the opportunity to turn their children’s creation into a memento that the child and his family can cherish for years to come.







Custom stuffed toys based on your children's artwork.

Everything about DrawYourToys.com is associated with the glee and happiness of the young age. The Idea was conceived in the minds of two childhood friends Bor Briscik and Marcel Zver, both of us like to draw, create and build all sorts of crazy things. One of those “crazy childhood ideas” we had is now known as DrawYourToys.com, which combines our passion for arts, drawings and love for children.



How we envisioned the order process, How it all Works








Send us a photo of the drawing and hardworking hands of our talented team of artists, cutters, and seamstress will come together to create each toy. We try to be as precise with every detail from the drawing.



A precious friend
Crafted plush toys made in such way become a precious and beloved child’s friend forever. After all, they have imagined the toy by themselves and is the fruit of their imagination and is entirely theirs.
Unique plush toys stimulate a child’s creativity.
Don’t let your children’s drawings remain forgotten in some closet or even in the basement. Change them into a cuddly toy that your child will love!


Putting safety first
We put a high emphasis on the quality of material used in the toys. We are very aware that all our products are primarily availed by children and hence we take extra care in making them hazard free and safe. So you can have a piece of mind while your child has a great time with his creations brought to life!





What We Need to Make It Happen 



We are just starting out in Ljubljana, Slovenia and have already encountered our first problems, particularly with acquiring the right fabrics. More specifically, with the prices and selection of material. 
When creating our first toys we tried with fabrics from a retail store, but it was proven to be unprofitable since the price of retail fabrics is to expensive. To be able to create unique toys and start up our business idea, we need to buy fabrics in bulk, directly from the manufacturer. Unfortunately, we are in dire need of funding considering we are just starting out and have already invested all of our savings into this project. 
With the received funds, we would be able to contact a wholesale seller in Italy that we have previously spoken to, and acquire the required fabrics. 

Also we currently have just one expert seamstress on our team, but additional funds would enable us to hire and train one additional seamstress, to help us with the creation of Unique Plush Toys.


If for whatever reason, our entire goal isn't reached, the project will still persist and the funds will still go toward the DrawYourToys project, although it will take longer to complete.  If we exceed our goal, there is a number of other amazing projects that the funding can help support (custom  bags, purses and  bedding with the motive of the children drawing sewn onto them) – there will be more updates on these as we get closer to our goal.

#LETStART


Ciao,
Sono Veronica Cestari, giovane artista italiana. Dopo
gli studi mi sono trasferita a Londra dove per un anno ho lavorato come
assistente di una promettente artista brasiliana. Alla fine di questa
esperienza ho deciso di incominciare la mia carriera artistica. Il primo passo
per iniziare seriamente questa attività è prendere uno spazio e creare il mio
studio d’artista!Ed è per questo che ho bisogno del tuo aiuto!Ho lanciato questa raccolta fondi in modo da avere un
sostegno economico per tutte le spese di affitto e per i materiali di cui avrò
bisogno. Questo portale web dà la possibilità in un modo nuovo di diffondere il
progetto in tutto il mondo e raccogliere fondi per far partire e crescere le
proprie idee. Con il tuo contributo avrò la possibilità di costruire le basi e
per sviluppare il mio lavoro artistico.Si tratta di un investimento!Infatti, in cambio al tuo fondamentale supporto,
riceverai un mio lavoro artistico, che fa parte di un progetto più grande. Nel
2011 ho prodotto un opera riflettendo sul concetto della memoria, e per tre
mesi ho lavorato costantemente creando ogni giorno un quadro, un pezzo unico
dove segni e colori potessero esprimere l’esperienza di ogni giorno vissuto.
Riceverai quindi un tassello unico, che compone un opera più grande e che sarà
punto di connessione tra tutti quelli che decideranno di fare questo
investimento.Ho diviso i lavori sotto quattro diverse fasce di
contributo (da 50 a 200€), di seguito e nella Gallery potrete vedere le foto di
tutti i quadri e a quale categoria corrispondono ( visibili anche tramite il
sito www.veronicacestari.it). Puoi sceglierlo e una volta deciso dovrai versare il contributo tramite PayPal (è necessario che mi comunichi quale hai scelto e il tuo indirizzo con un commento privato fatto tramite questo
stesso sito). L’opera sarà poi consegnata per posta incorniciata e con
attestato di originalità.
Grazie per il tuo supporto,
Veronica

-------------Dear reader, I am Veronica Cestari, a young
Italian artist specializing in sculpture with a broad interest in various
media. After a year of experience in London as the assistant of a great
Brazilian artist, I have decided to go back to Italy and start creating my own
artworks. I intend to open my personal studio to realize this project.
In fact, I need my own
lovely place where I could come up with my ideas and create great pieces.
That's why, dear reader, I need your help! 
Nowadays life for a young
artist is really tough and it's hard to sustain all the costs especially at the
beginning. I need to cover the costs of the rent, tools, materials and
furniture. Thus, I really need some external help. Thanks to this web portal, I
am trying to raise funds that would allow me to start working. With your
contribution I would be able to lay the foundations for my long-term project
and really express my ideas. I could finally convey my own style and contribute
to the complex and beautiful world of Art.
In order to open my studio and
reach my goal, I have decided to start selling pieces of my artwork. You
will receive one of my pieces as a perk of your fundamental support.In 2011 I produced an art
piece that allowed me to investigate the concept of memory. I worked on it for three
months of my life and each day became a picture, a unique piece where signs and
colors expressed the impression that I lived. 
I have decided to give these
""days of my life"" to those who contribute to my future. I am glad to spread these pieces of memory around as they can be, in some way, a connection between me,
the artist, and you, the one that is making my start possible.
I hope to hear
from you soon and don't hesitate to write to me for more information about my
work, my history and my future.
Thanks for your help.
Veronica (see images at www.veronicacestari.it or in the Gallery)Why is the goal 7000€? I have estimated my expenses around 500€ for the monthly rent and some extra costs, so that 7000€ will allow me to cover one year of work.I primi sette (First seven) - Memory's perk - 50€ each

Febbraio (February) - Memory's perks - 100€ each



Marzo (March) - Memory's perks - 150€ each



Giugno (June) - Memory's perks - 200€ each





MORE ABOUT THE MEMORY PIECES
The work is about memory and
it represents my daily memory turned into visual impression. I dedicated myself
to observing how and what happened to me every day constantly for three months.
I used objects and colors to focus on what consciously and unconsciously was
stacked in my mind at the end of the day. The result was paintings with traces
which try to emerge through a plain surface and which are still packed in a
kind of envelope.
This work represented a
challenge to myself that helped me to understand the importance of memory. 
I found that images can be
part of a recollection: the painting becomes an object through which memory can
be brought back to life.
This work tries to deepen the
concept of how we are shaped in time through that which we come across day by day.
Personal impressions are
now packed and barely seen, but they still carry the intensity of something
that has been lived by someone and that could
lead to a recollection or a connection between something else that has happened
in someone else’s life experience.
I used various materials, most of which are things from daily life, or tiny objects that I
found on my way, that, in some way, are related with what happened to me. These
have been mixed and stitched with wire, wax, or enamel on boards. After this
act of collection, I gently covered the
whole combination with a sheet of paper on a board.
The final surface has been oiled and it interacts with the different layers.
The result is an amalgamation of seen and un-seen images, where the experience comes alive through the recollection of fragments.
Each pieces is 11x18 cm big,
in a 23x32 cm frame.

</div></div>","Be ToonBombed NowHip Hop Culture in Korea is huge. Korean youths wear high quality fashion such a snapbacks, timberlands, and accessories reflecting the culture. Many are involved in the community ranging from breakdancing to rapping. I thought hip hop was only big in America...I had no clue hip hop has had such a huge impact on another culture such as Seoul, Korea. THE EVENT WILL TAKE PLACE AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER .
If you Interested in Sponsoring FUSION Please Contact at Stewardmaine1993@gmail.com
OR
DONATE TO A GREAT EVENT


MY GOAL is to Create an Event called ""FUSION"" In Seoul Korea to unify hip hop cultures with live performances by Korean and American rappers, hip hop dancers, a DJ mixing old school and new school hip hop with models wearing my brand and art showcased by my Brand Runur 'DE' Rabbit to show how Hip Hop has inspired me and influenced.


 The Birth of Hip Hop struck the planet in the late 70's in New York, Bronx. Pictures  include the Rocksteady crew who first appeared in the film ""Flashdance"" in 1979 as well as BeatStreet and showing the world this new and exciting style of dance. Other Legends that gave birth to the hip hop culture were The Fat Boys, Afrika Bambaata  RUNDMC and many more.






Korean Hip Hop is new exciting and fresh. Its has great music and fashion sense such a ""Jay Park"" a Famous rapper and dancer who has the culture down to a science as well as ""TaeYang"" whose apart of the famous KPOP Group Big Bang









FUSION will be supported by Hm Entertainment and Hallyumagazine


After being in Korea for a few months one of the biggest Breakdancing events in the world ""Red Bull BC one"" was being hosted there. This was my first time meeting breakdancers in seoul and being inspired by the community.


FUSION is already a success. The Biggest Breakdancing Event in Korea ""R16"" R=Respect and 16 standing for 16 different countries. Before leaving Korea I had the experience of attending and watching first hand people unite through hip hop. 



Art By Runur ""DE"" Rabbit


Have a Runur ""DE"" Rabbit T-Shirt







Send me your photo and have it designed like a character in Runur ""DE"" Rabbits Universe.


Send me a selfie and have it bombed by Runur ""DE"" Rabbit

My name is Jermaine Steward and I am the creator of RUNUR ""DE"" Rabbit  a new an upcoming Brand. 
The story is about Runur ""DE"" Rabbit  the leader of a group of misfits heavily influenced by the Hip Hop culture living in a dystopian world, where animals and humans are at war. At Night Runur and his crew run a underground hip hop scene. Humans and animals are free to come together and express themselves through rapping, tagging and dancing . The only rule is to respect everyone. Only problem is when the sun rises humans and animals separate and are forced to run from the law.
Runur and his crews would like to be showcased for the first time at ""FUSION"" an Event in Seoul Korea with the dream of Unifying Cultures

PLEASE donate at least 5usd and help make a positive change, WE are trying but luck has not been on our side.
We are Mayhem Troopers we want art and music, laughter and anger,we are husband, wife and friends, artists, musicians, music fans, humble weirdos and lovers of independence. This is our pet project, born from a passion to do what we love and enable others to do the same.
We are partnering with artists and bands to offer a wide variety of t-shirts, patches, posters and buttons.  All bands, current or defunct, will get paid, setting us apart from 95% of the people screening ""punk"" patches
Our focus is the community we live in, the local bands as well as the global underground art and music community. We will do our small part to keep the scene alive by helping artists generate income from their work.
We are striving to become a solid resource for friends touring the US, with a streamlined setup to deliver quality faster and better.   We will be as mobile as possible to handle merch for bands on the road too so they can focus on the music.
PATCHES!!Embroidered patches are the main focus with awesome bands, weird artists and our own insane and twisted ideas, this is going to be fun!



SHIRT, PINS, POSTERS?Yes, yes, yes





The team



Daniel, born and raised in Sweden, with strong ties to the underground diy punk network where he took an active part in from the late eighties, writing zines and websites, running his record label as well as a mail-order and screen print operation.  Eventually he moved to the US to pursue his other passion: roaring engines!  But an urge to be a resource rather than a consumer in a scene he loved refused to leave him alone., He also works a lot on old motorcycles and makes weird stuff.
In the US he met and married Billie Austin, a self-taught lowbrow artist.  She was looking for ways to branch out with her art and decided to make some patch and t shirt designs.  They decided to reach out to more artists and musicians and merge together their creative ambitions, and so the collective Mayhem Troopers was born.
Magnus Jansson Lives in Gothenburg, Sweden. These days he is mostly doing ink and pencil drawings, but likes to paint as well. He has had several  solo exhibitions and been represented in fine art museums, as well as doing illustrations for bands like:Avskum, DooM, Skitkids, P.r.o.b.l.e.m.s. and many more.


Colin AmbulanceThe Los Angeles-based artist and musician known as Colin Ambulance may be best known for his paintings and illustrations he has sold  primarily online since 2011. He has also been a member of numerous bands and musical projects spanning the last 2 decades as well as designed record covers and graphics for an extensive list of recording artist.

</div><p></p><h3>Short Summary</h3><p>Remember that scholarship and artistic boost that Mount Gretna School of Art provided students in the incredible summer of 2014?</p><p>Now the school needs your help to purchase its first artist cottage.</p><p></p><h3>What We Need</h3><p>Here's the details:</p><ul>
<li>We need the ""class of 2014"" to raise more than $500 to help reach our goal to purchase and renovate a cottage in Mount Gretna.</li>
<li>Every donation will be matched dollar for dollar by a challenge grant. So if we raise $500 then it gets doubled by the grant to $1000!!!  If we raise more than that the dollar for dollar match continues up to $150,000 (just in case and we're not kidding)!</li>
<li>If we don't reach our goal we run the risk of being unable to secure housing next year and thereby jeopardizing the program.  Show the greater community of Mount Gretna how much you valued your experience at MGSoA with a donation.</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>Your contribution will:</p><ul>
<li>help stabilize housing which has been increasingly difficult and unstable to secure, putting the program in jeopardy.</li>
<li>place a foundation under the intensive program that has skyrocketed in reputation, attracting more and more applicants every year and recognition nationwide.</li>
<li>motivate other supporters of the school to give even more. It will have a big impact for supporters to see former students pitching in.</li>
<li>activate a dollar for dollar challenge match from a foundation grant.  If the ""class of 2013"" can raise $500, for example, it will be matched by the foundation dollar to dollar having a $1000 overall impact with the match!</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>We need to act quickly as we have only until August 31st to reach our goal.</p><ul>
<li>We already have the BIG donor.  All we need now is for lots of other donors to pitch in their fair share.</li>
<li>If everyone in the class of 2014 gives $25, $50 or $100 then we'll meet our goal EASY.</li>
<li>Donations large and small are helping.  It all adds up (especially with that matching grant)!</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Want to know how to help even more?:</p><ul>
<li>Ask friends and family to get the word out and make some noise about this campaign.</li>
<li>Remind them about the support you received from MGSoA and the impact the intensive program has had!</li>

<p>My passion for nature is apparent in my artwork and I've realized reconnecting to the creative spirit I had as a child has been invaluable to my life.  So many people have told me they wished they could draw, paint or create like I do.  I think that it is in all of us - we just need to reconnect to that inner child, the one that loved to create and didn't care what it looked like...if the grass was purple, it didn't matter, you were proud of what you created. And this is where the idea for the Art by Peleegirl colouring books was born.</p>
<p>I have four books planned in the series - Warbler, Owls, Stinkin' Cute Woodland Creatures and Wildflower Mandalas.  All the of the books will feature stylistic depictions of plants and animals and while you are reconnecting with your creativity, you can also connect to the natural world around you. </p>
<p>My campaign is modest - I'm looking for support to develop and print these books.  Your funds will assist in four different areas:</p>
<p>1.  Creation of the artwork for the colouring books $400</p>
<p>2. Scanning, editing artwork and creating print ready files for books  - $1300</p>
<p>3. Printing of the initial run of books $1000</p>
<p>4. Administrative fees for campaign and rewards, including exclusive art cards, original paintings and other goodies - $300</p>
<p>I am excited to have the opportunity to share my art with the world.   Until very recently, I was hesitant to call myself an artist or share my work with others.  I see the value in living a creative life and want to help others reconnect with theirs.  I've always thought I would publish a book - I never guessed it would be a colouring book.</p>
<p>I am dedicated to finding a way for this project to move forward - I already have bookstores and other parties interested in my books. so I have the motivation to see this project through to the end.  And I don't want to stop with four books - this is just the stepping stone to more opportunities.</p>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>I always have a lot of balls in the air at any given time.  I volunteer much of my free time to several different organizations, I'm dedicated to my work and sometimes time to work on my art is limited.  I have set a deadline of the end of September 2015 to have the first two books printed, to coincide with a major birding convention.  </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you can't support me financially, I understand - share my campaign with your friends and family.  The more people out there talking about what I'm working on the better.  Stay tuned for the release date for the books,</p>

<h3>HYAH!</h3>
<p>Howdy, the name's Nick. I'm a small time artist living in the heart of California. I love collecting unique pins, almost as much as I love that first peek when you open a box of pizza.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>So here's the details.</h3>
<p>This campaign is going to be the basis to spread the love of LoZ and Pizza! This will all go in to the cost of production for both the pins, and stickers. Postage supplies are also included for this campaign, I have left no stone un-turned and have calculated exactly what this campaign needs.</p>
<p>65% pin production</p>
<p>15% sticker production</p>
<p>15% postage supplies</p>
<p>5% IGG fees</p>
<p>If we can reach the stretch goal of $700 a second pin will be added to the campaign! Another epic LoZ pin!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The pins are still in pre-production, but the stickers and t-shirts have been completed!</p>
