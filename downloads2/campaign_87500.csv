<p class=""p2"">Original music for the solo classical guitar inspired by Ralph Towner, Andrew York, Lenny Breau, Roland Dyens, Gene Bertoncini, and others. I honestly believe that these pieces can become embraced as new repertoire for guitarists everywhere.</p>
<p class=""p2"">For fellow guitar geeks: You'll appreciate the finely crafted tremolo pieces (including one in open C-minor tuning), the jazz-tinged pieces, and the 5-movement narrative suite that borrows it's harmonic language from modes rarely explored by classical guitar composers. </p>

<h3 class=""p1""><strong>The Monster Suite - with animated video</strong></h3>
<p class=""p2"">I'm especially proud of <em>The Monster Suite</em>. It's a 5-movement narrative suite about the plight of this monstrous creature. I've teamed up with <strong>SF-based artist Gabe Wexler</strong> (<a href=""http://www.gabewexler.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.gabewexler.com</a>) who will create an animated video that conveys the story. This video will be for sale, and I hope to be able to perform along with it in concerts. Excerpted from my program notes:</p>
<p class=""p3"">""In this suite I aim to convey a story of discrimination, of what it means to be different and have to fight for acceptance.</p>
<p class=""p3"">The brooding introductory movement sheds light on the birth of the monster. Young and dumb, our lead character finds his way into town, hoping to integrate into a society that is clearly not ready for him. The people of the town drive him away, afraid of this unsightly and seemingly threatening beast. The crestfallen creature retreats into hiding and plans an attack on the vile people. Upon his return to the city, the bumbling beast poorly attempts a half-hearted attack, realizing at that moment that he is truly incapable of living up to his reputation as a dangerous monster. The townspeople see that he is not dangerous at all but simply seeking acceptance and refuge. In his failure they see in him his distinctly human qualities, perhaps a reflection of their own shortcomings. The suite concludes with an uptempo dance in which the monster joins the townspeople in celebration of his acceptance into their society. My hope is that this will keep listeners on their toes and perhaps make them think of the monsters in their own lives who may just be harmless projections of their own fears and illusions.""</p>
<p class=""p4""><strong>If there are any other classical guitar composers in the world who are doing something like this, I'd like to meet them! I believe I'm providing contributors with an opportunity to participate in something truly unique. </strong></p>

<p class=""p4"">I will have a physical copy of the complete set of scores from this album available for purchase. </p>
<p class=""p4""> </p>
<h3 class=""p4""><strong>Budget</strong></h3>
<p class=""p3"">I've always believed in the saying ""Go big or go home"". I plan to record the album at home or in a rented space, but the costs are still high for all of the other phases. For example, Gabe will have to labor for hours a day for over month to create the video. Costs of creating physical copies of CDs, DVDs, and books (score) are high as well. I don't want to divulge dollar amounts to respect the various artists involved, but here are some of the expenditures OTHER THAN recording and mixing, which I hope to do myself or with little help: </p>

<p class=""p3"">Fees (IndieGoGo, Paypal, etc)</p>
<p class=""p3""><strong>If I'm able to go above my goal, I could:</strong> </p>
<p class=""p3"">Hire a producer and/or engineer to ensure the highest soung quality</p>

<p>We are a rock band from Southern California.  We're in the middle of our anti- bully school tour, and it couldn't be going any better!  We're visiting a different school every day, meeting tons of great kids and teachers and feel like we're really making a difference! </p>
<p>The assembly we put together consists of a discussion about the bullying problem, along with suggestions on how to deal with it. The main point we drive home to the students is that if you see bullying happening to someone else, or if you're dealing with it yourself - you need to SAY SOMETHING.  Tell an adult, a teacher, a parent… someone who can help the situation.  If kids continue to just ignore the problem and keep it to themselves, it will never improve and could take a turn for the worst- as we learned from the movie ""Bully"".</p>
<p>Our school assembly then leads into a 3 song performance by our band Breaking 27.  We end our set with the song called ""We Like To Watch"" - that's our original song we created specifically about the bully problem. In some schools, we've been able to show the music video as well! Everyone really seems to respond to it!</p>
<p>Thanks to our many generous supporters out there, when our first tour is over, we will have visited 14 schools, delivering our anti-bully message to approximately 14,000 students!  From both students and teachers we've been getting an overwhelming response!  So much so, that we want to keep the momentum going and visit more schools!  We would like to double the number of schools we visit, bringing the total number of schools to 28, and  reaching approximately 28,000 kids!</p>

To date, the PYO has performed in Italy, Jordan, Greece, Lebanon, Syria, Germany, Bahrain and Palestine. <br/><br/>In July 2012, the PYO completed its most ambitious project to date. Following a week of intensive rehearsals at the Conservatorio Pagnini in Genoa, the PYO performed at five leading concert venues and music festivals, travelling from the North to the South of Italy. The orchestra performed at venues including the Teatro Carlo Felice, Genoa and the Conservatorio Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome, as well as the festivals of Florenece, Levanto and Ravello. Alongside Beethoven’s Symphony no. 8 and Rimsky Korsakov’s Spanish <em>Capriccio Espagnol</em>, the PYO accompanied the young Palestinian soprano Dima Bawab in two beautiful orchestral songs by Delibes and Dvorak. In keeping with their promise to promote the best of new Arabic music, the programme also featured music from two emerging Syrian composers: Kinan Azmeh’s contemplative and inspiring <em>November 22nd</em> was excellently performed by the young Palestinian clarinetist Mohamed Najem, and the orchestra was delighted to welcome the brilliant violinist Maias Al Yamani, to perform as soloist in his own piece, <em>Sea Waves</em>, for Arabic violin and orchestra. In recognition of Palestine being it's most recent member, and in respect of Palestine's recent cultural landmark achievements, the PYO received patronage from the Italian National Commission of UNESCO in 2012 for it's tour of Italy. </p>
<div> </div>
<div>In 2013 the PYO is bringing it's talent home to Palestine, having successfully received funding from the European Union. The orchestra will perform in Palestinian towns and cities, before repeating the programme in Jordan,Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Busan (South Korea). <br/><div>
<br/><strong>MEMBERS OF THE PYO</strong><br/><br/>Every year, approximately 75 young musicians take part in the PYO. Performers are between 13-26 years of age, with roughly equal numbers of female and male participants. Participants range from young music students studying at Palestinian music schools, advanced students studying outside Palestine, young people studying or working in other fields who have continued to play and study music as a hobby, and young professional musicians who have continued to benefit from participating in the PYO in the early years of their professional music careers. Students living inside Palestine, are joined by students from the Palestinian refugee diaspora, including those living inJordan, Lebanon, Syria, Algeria and Egypt, as well as further afield. The ESNCM often works with partner organisations in other countries, to organise exchange programmes for students who gain a unique insight into Palestinian culture, and get to know young musicians from Palestine, often forming lasting and valuable friendships. In 2012 exchanges were completed with the conservatoires of Rome and Genoa. 
<div>
<br/><strong>EXPERT COACHING</strong><br/><br/>Students in each section of the orchestra spend time away from full rehearsals, to be guided by expert coaches, including leading symphony orchestra musicians and soloists. In 2012, the PYO launched a new partnership with the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra, who will sent three of their musicians to guide the young musicians towards their final performances. The Norwegian professionals were joined by professors from the conservatoires of Rome and Genoa, and were led by the English conductor Sian Edwards, a former music director of English National Opera, who has appeared with the orchestra in four separate years. <br/><br/><strong>UNIQUE PROGRAMMING</strong><br/><br/>Still only in its first decade, the PYO has a reputation as a leading promoter of Palestinian and Arabic orchestral music. The orchestra has commissioned new music by leading Arab composers and regularly delivers acclaimed performances of music already familiar to Arabic audiences, widening the popularity of this music from their home region and out to the wider world. The PYO has recently worked with composers such as Marcel Khalife, Kinan Azmeh, Ahmad al-Khattib, Maias Al Yamani, Issa Boulos, Roger Johansson, Rima Tarazi and John Bisharat, and performed revivals of popular music by the Rahbani brothers, Samih Shkeir and others. Alongside Arabic music, the PYO has performed some of the most beautiful and advanced orchestral works in treh Western repertoire, having recently programmed music by Beethoven, Dvorak, Rimsky-Korsakov, Brahms, Tchaikovsky, Haydn, Shostakovich, Katchaturian and Gershwin.</div>

You've come to the right place. </div><div><br/></div><div>We are <b>The Gold Medalists</b>, Bay Area based indie-rock group. We’ve been playing and recording music for a few years now - DIY style. We play music because <b>we love it.</b> We don't make money off it, but we continue to do it because we live, breath, sleep, bleed music. We're looking for your help! </div><div><br/></div><div>
<p>We recorded our first LP in 2013 called <b><i>Versus Tigers</i></b>, funded by us. It’s on iTunes but if you contribute towards our new album, we'll give you <i>Versus Tigers </i>as part of the deal. </p>

<p><b><i>SO WHAT’S THE DEAL? </i></b></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We have ten new songs that we really like. We think they rock….like sitting on a wild mechanic bull while being pelted with frozen mint-chocolate chip ice cream cones by a team of professional puppeteers drinking from a broken bottle of Black Label. </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We want to get back into the studio, record new music and unleash it into the world. </b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The album is called, </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Versus the Sea.</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> We have no cover art yet (wink wink artist friends). </span></p>
<p>We're asking for <b>$3,000</b> which doesn't even cover all our recording expenses (recording, mixing, mastering) but we're just looking for a bit of help. Also, our singer quit his 9-year job so he's a bum now and would totally appreciate any contributions. But even more importantly, we know our friends and family love us and have bought our previous albums because they want to support us. But rather than paying Apple or any other digital music services out there, which they take most of the money and we don't see a dime (or maybe we only see a dime), you can give the full amount of the album to us. <b>Cut the middleman. Everyone wins! Praise the Internet! </b></p>
<p>If we raise more than $3K, we'll look at spending it on: </p>
<p>1. $3,000 = Funded! Helps us pay for most of the recording costs<br/>2. $4,500 = Recording studio costs and mixing/mastering paid in full! <br/>3. $5,000 = We'll make CDs (does anyone still buy CDs?!!!); or maybe we'll make vinyl or mini-disks or cassette tapes or VHS tapes or hyper color band t -shirts<br/>4. $10,000 = We'll hire Steve Albini to help record, if he's into it.... Or we'll spend the left-over money making a cool music video<br/>6. $100,000 = We'll do everything above, spend more time in the studio to make a great record, and maybe buy some ice cream sandwiches. </p>
<p>At this point, you're probably wondering <b>what risks are involved in completing this project. </b></p>
<p>Well, t<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">he songs are basically written. So unless one of us gets into a fist fight with a giraffe, we fall of the edge of this flat planet, or NASA warp drives us to Mega-Earth, we should be okay to record this album by year-end.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We'll keep you updated on our progress and how much time we spend playing music vs playing video games.</span></p>

<b><i>THE GOLD MEDALISTS BIO</i></b>
</div><div><b><i><br/></i></b></div><div>
<p>In 2008, The Gold Medalists was formed as an eclectic musical side project of Bay Area musician Peter Van Nguyen (Ee, Total Shutdown). The two-man group (with Stanley Lam of Scrabbel, Largesse) spent the following years adding new members and honing their craft, ultimately arriving at a sound that's as comfortable with round melodies as it is with angular guitar strokes. Settling into a line-up consisting of Nguyen on vocals and guitar, Alex Charlow on bass, Jason Cornwell on lead guitar, and Steve Hinan on drums, the indie-rock band headed into the studio in early 2013 to record their first full-length album, ""Versus Tigers."" </p>
<p>The Gold Medalists rarely perform outside of San Francisco and have found a loyal Bay Area fan base consisting mostly of nerds, video game writers, marketers, and programmers, as well as friends, family, and occasionally a group of heckling drunks. </p>

</div></div>","Hello friends, family, and strangers looking to support Olympic athletes. You've come to the right place. We are The Gold Medalists, Bay Area based indie-rock group. We’ve been playing and recording music for a few years now - DIY style. We play music because we love it. We don't make money off it, but we continue to do it because we live, breath, sleep, bleed music. We're looking for your help! 
We recorded our first LP in 2013 called Versus Tigers, funded by us. It’s on iTunes but if you contribute towards our new album, we'll give you Versus Tigers as part of the deal. 


Also, because you're so nice and visited our Indiegogo page, you can download our self-titled EP (2012) right now for free right here: http://goo.gl/MoiUY


SO WHAT’S THE DEAL? 
We have ten new songs that we really like. We think they rock….like sitting on a wild mechanic bull while being pelted with frozen mint-chocolate chip ice cream cones by a team of professional puppeteers drinking from a broken bottle of Black Label. We want to get back into the studio, record new music and unleash it into the world. The album is called, Versus the Sea. We have no cover art yet (wink wink artist friends). 
We're asking for $3,000 which doesn't even cover all our recording expenses (recording, mixing, mastering) but we're just looking for a bit of help. Also, our singer quit his 9-year job so he's a bum now and would totally appreciate any contributions. But even more importantly, we know our friends and family love us and have bought our previous albums because they want to support us. But rather than paying Apple or any other digital music services out there, which they take most of the money and we don't see a dime (or maybe we only see a dime), you can give the full amount of the album to us. Cut the middleman. Everyone wins! Praise the Internet! 
If we raise more than $3K, we'll look at spending it on: 
1. $3,000 = Funded! Helps us pay for most of the recording costs2. $4,500 = Recording studio costs and mixing/mastering paid in full! 3. $5,000 = We'll make CDs (does anyone still buy CDs?!!!); or maybe we'll make vinyl or mini-disks or cassette tapes or VHS tapes or hyper color band t -shirts4. $10,000 = We'll hire Steve Albini to help record, if he's into it.... Or we'll spend the left-over money making a cool music video6. $100,000 = We'll do everything above, spend more time in the studio to make a great record, and maybe buy some ice cream sandwiches. 
At this point, you're probably wondering what risks are involved in completing this project. 
Well, the songs are basically written. So unless one of us gets into a fist fight with a giraffe, we fall of the edge of this flat planet, or NASA warp drives us to Mega-Earth, we should be okay to record this album by year-end.
We'll keep you updated on our progress and how much time we spend playing music vs playing video games.
Thanks for reading and thanks for supporting us. 


THE GOLD MEDALISTS BIO

In 2008, The Gold Medalists was formed as an eclectic musical side project of Bay Area musician Peter Van Nguyen (Ee, Total Shutdown). The two-man group (with Stanley Lam of Scrabbel, Largesse) spent the following years adding new members and honing their craft, ultimately arriving at a sound that's as comfortable with round melodies as it is with angular guitar strokes. Settling into a line-up consisting of Nguyen on vocals and guitar, Alex Charlow on bass, Jason Cornwell on lead guitar, and Steve Hinan on drums, the indie-rock band headed into the studio in early 2013 to record their first full-length album, ""Versus Tigers."" 
The Gold Medalists rarely perform outside of San Francisco and have found a loyal Bay Area fan base consisting mostly of nerds, video game writers, marketers, and programmers, as well as friends, family, and occasionally a group of heckling drunks. 
The group believes in the DIY philosophy and have played and recorded music on their own dime to share what they love with the world. Keep it simple. Keep the music alive.  
In the fall of 2014, The Gold Medalists will head into the SF studio, Tiny Telephone, to record their second full-length album.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

PRÉSENTATION

Depuis toujours, la musique trouve un profond écho en moi. Puissant véhicule d'émotions, elle est devenue vitale à mon équilibre. C'est à travers elle que j'exprime ma sensibilité, mon rapport à moi-même et au monde. En 2012, avec l'aide de plusieurs collaborateurs, je me dévoilais comme auteure-compositrice-interprète avec un premier EP autoproduit. Depuis, j'ai eu la chance d'obtenir des bourses du Conseil des arts et lettres du Québec et du Conseil des arts au Canada pour me soutenir dans ma création. J'ai aussi été invitée à participer à plusieurs événements et vitrines (Francofolies, Coup de Coeur Francophone, Francouvertes, Festival Vue sur le Relève, Festival en chanson de Petite-Vallée), et à ma grande surprise, récolter quelques prix au passage.



ALBUM 2016



Après avoir plongé dans des univers folk et aériens avec un premier EP et, plus récemment, avec la formation Lisbonne Télégramme, je ressens le besoin d’explorer un espace différent, plus groovy, soul, donnant au corps le goût de s’exprimer, mais faisant aussi place à la voix et aux émotions. La sortie de l'album est prévue pour septembre 2016. À la fameuse question ""C'est quel genre?"", je pourrais répondre que ça ressemble à une rencontre entre Norah Jones, Massive Attack et DarkSide.

<div>You can be a part of this project by pre-ordering it ! this way you'd be helping us with the costs relative to its production:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>That is essentially <b>mixing and mastering costs</b> as well as the <b>pressing</b> of the CD, the rest being Indiegogo fee and other small fees.</div>

<div>If the campaign goes further than the chosen goal, we'll be making other videos, the more we obtain the better quality the videos will be, we're hoping to make a very big one for one of the track !</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We hope to release a <b>high quality record</b>, we're doing everything we can to obtain a result we'll be forever pride of!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>That being said, no matter what happens with this campaign we'll go to the very end of the production, so if you pre-order the EP (digital or physical), or merchandising, you're certain to receive it in June.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>One more thing, if you like our music please <b>share this project to your friends or wherever you can</b>, we'd really appreciate that! It can be a game changer :)</div>

</div>","Hi ! We are Sunday Night Syndrome, an Electro-Pop trio from Lyon, France.

You can listen to our single in this video clip: 





WE NEED YOU !

We're currently working on our first EP that will be released next June! There will be 5 tracks on the record.
You can be a part of this project by pre-ordering it ! this way you'd be helping us with the costs relative to its production:

That is essentially mixing and mastering costs as well as the pressing of the CD, the rest being Indiegogo fee and other small fees.


       




                               


Every participation will be a huge help for us! 

If the campaign goes further than the chosen goal, we'll be making other videos, the more we obtain the better quality the videos will be, we're hoping to make a very big one for one of the track !

We hope to release a high quality record, we're doing everything we can to obtain a result we'll be forever pride of!

That being said, no matter what happens with this campaign we'll go to the very end of the production, so if you pre-order the EP (digital or physical), or merchandising, you're certain to receive it in June.

One more thing, if you like our music please share this project to your friends or wherever you can, we'd really appreciate that! It can be a game changer :)

Follow us to receive news about the band, teasers, behind the scenes photos and videos etc...

eliminated, vastly improving the treble. 
 </p><p>We are most excited about using evolutionary computing techniques

didn't think!  It was just easier to build that way.

background to create a project plan that begins with a series of 
computer simulations that will deliver the optimum shape and material 
properties of a piano soundboard.  That data will be used to build up to
 3 composite soundboards.  David Rubenstein, of Rubenstein Pianos, will 
build a custom 10 foot grand piano using this soundboard.  Delwin 
Fandrich, the legendary piano engineer will design the scale and guide the project to success
 with his decades of experience.  <br/></p><p>In addition to the carbon fiber soundboard.....bridge agraffes, a welded-steel string plate, and a monolithic stack of laminated panels , all optimized for maximum stiffness 
and minimum weight, will replace the traditional cast iron plate and  
inner rim-and-strut construction.  Wessel, Nickel and Gross actions with
 glass and carbon fiber reinforced parts will provide consistent, high 
performance. <br/></p><p>Finally, an expanded compass beyond the normal 88 keys
 will push this piano to the current limits of modern design and 
materials, and issue a challenge to piano composer’s to write for it, and piano performers to play it.  If you are a jazz pianist, imagine improvising on a piano with 102 keys.  
All of these features will combine to yield quite possibly the most 
technologically advanced piano in the world, and a design process to 
adapt any piano to Evolutionary Piano carbon fiber composite soundboard technology.</p><p>The rewards are:</p><ol>

<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>It’s
important to us that our music makes an impact.  Our album is titled “Oakland Loves You” because we wanted to
pay tribute to a city that, despite many challenges, strives for justice and
equality. People’s Grocery in West Oakland is an organization that we felt also
embodied this spirit, which is why we chose to raise at least $1000 for
their community projects that aim to bring healthy food to those with little access to it.  </p>

<br/><p></p></span></span></div>","Who We Are:
We are Midnight Raid, a bunch of like-minded musicians who have
found each other and our groove in Oakland, CA!  We believe in two things: making good music and making a
positive difference in our community.  Both of these take a huge amount of collaboration to
accomplish.  We are hoping you’ll
help us with our dual goal of raising enough funds to finish our debut studio
album and donate $1000 (or more) to People’s Grocery, a non-profit organization
fighting for food security in areas of Oakland lacking reasonable access to
healthy food.
What We Need & What You Get:
Our
goal: $5000 
·  $4000 for mixing, mastering, artwork and CD production 
·  $1000 donation to People’s Grocery
Our
sweet perks:

We have awesome schwag from trucker hats and koozies to
     custom T-shirts!
You could also get a performance from the band, with a
     complimentary bottle of wine!
Since we’re also donating a portion of the funds to a
     great charity, you get peace of mind knowing you gave back!




The Impact
It’s
important to us that our music makes an impact.  Our album is titled “Oakland Loves You” because we wanted to
pay tribute to a city that, despite many challenges, strives for justice and
equality. People’s Grocery in West Oakland is an organization that we felt also
embodied this spirit, which is why we chose to raise at least $1000 for
their community projects that aim to bring healthy food to those with little access to it.  
Please
take a moment and check out their videos here to learn more about the
organization: http://www.peoplesgrocery.org/videos

<p><span>For those of you who have never been, Black water is much more than a Portland based record label.  It’s also a long running store/venue, collection of artist/practice spaces, recording studio and community gathering space. It has hosted and been the focal point for events and projects such as book and record releases, art shows, record swaps, underground movie premieres and benefit events.</span></p><p><br/>More importantly though, it doesn’t change the fact that we can no longer host bands at the Russell St. location. Over the years, Black Water has provided a staging point for dozens of bands and artists. Each of which has contributed to the continued strength and growth of the underground community. It’s one of the many reasons the city of Portland has such a renowned reputation for its underground music scene, and we are determined to make sure this essential kind of community resource continues well into the future.</p><p><br/></p><p>Since 2008, Black Water has inhabited 2 different brick and mortar spaces – but not by choice. Each location, after a few years of dedication and hard work, solidified into a well establish and relied upon focal point in the underground community; and each space has, in turn, run headlong into forces that have halted their momentum. </p><p><br/></p>
<p>The first space on SE Morrison, which also included a café and community garden, was bought out by condo developers. The second, and current space on NE Russell, has had to end its in-store venue because of the bureaucratic restrictions of the space itself. Basically, the city and fire marshal shut the shows down and may still shut the studios and record store down as well. Unable to see where we are coming from in our DIY anti-cooperate mentality toward music and community, they have gifted us with a small mountain of steep fines and a list of code requirements in order to keep the existing Russell St space going – even without shows.</p><p><br/></p>
<p>The Mob played the last show we had at this space – back in May – and even though they were cool enough to pass around a donation jar at the end of the show, it truly didn’t come close to the amount of fines the city threw at us and the construction and building upgrades we are required to take on just to keep host of artist/practice spaces, recording studio and record store going.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>Bands that have called Black Water home

What is Black Water?

For those of you who have never been, Black water is much more than a Portland based record label.  It’s also a long running store/venue, collection of artist/practice spaces, recording studio and community gathering space. It has hosted and been the focal point for events and projects such as book and record releases, art shows, record swaps, underground movie premieres and benefit events.More importantly though, it doesn’t change the fact that we can no longer host bands at the Russell St. location. Over the years, Black Water has provided a staging point for dozens of bands and artists. Each of which has contributed to the continued strength and growth of the underground community. It’s one of the many reasons the city of Portland has such a renowned reputation for its underground music scene, and we are determined to make sure this essential kind of community resource continues well into the future.Since 2008, Black Water has inhabited 2 different brick and mortar spaces – but not by choice. Each location, after a few years of dedication and hard work, solidified into a well establish and relied upon focal point in the underground community; and each space has, in turn, run headlong into forces that have halted their momentum. 
The first space on SE Morrison, which also included a café and community garden, was bought out by condo developers.

Goal: A venue for the underground community. Starting over from scratch every few years, after putting so much time and dedication into a space, is a major pain in the ass and honestly pretty disheartening, exhausting and disappointing to all the folks who invest their time and energy into making Black Water what it is. We want a space for our community that will last. Our goal is to establish a permitted venue, restaurant, bar, and brewery.



Expanding Black Water – A new location on NE 9th & Broadway
For years now, Black Water has provided an all-ages show space, hosting events for international touring and local bands, and contributing to the ongoing strength and growth of the wider underground community. The sole purpose of this space is to keep the diy scene, and its centering foundation of music, free and alive.This new space will combine the recognizable aesthetics of Black Water with the necessity of establishing a permitted venue space. This is so that we can keep it open and existing for years to come. And just like when we set out to develop and build-out the first two locations, there’s a lot of construction that will need to happen. We plan to transform an old restaurant into the type of space we all look forward to being a part of. 





The Benefits of the new space:The goals of the space will be to provide new benefits that the Russell St space can no longer provide - beyond the most important fact… that we will be able to host bands and other events without hassle! We hope to provide a space to host all ages events on a regular basis. In addition, the restaurant portion will feature a full vegetarian menu. We will also attempt to provide paying jobs to some of the many people who have tirelessly volunteered to make Black Water happen over the years, and help give them an outlet to establish their own contributing endeavors.


What We Need:Shameless promotion - $250A  business license - $100Permits to the man - $2500+Building supplies (including a lot of black paint) - $10,000Upgrade of sound gear! - $5,000Fees and permits from the city and fire marshall- $6,000Kitchen equipment - $3,000+Brewery equipment upgrades - $2,000etc...the list goes on and on


In Conclusion . . .Please share this page and help us spread the word!  We have already started work on the new building and can't wait to share the new space with everyone! We really appreciate everything you can and already do to keep our scene alive in 2014...and beyond!!!",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Ars Minerva - Ifigenia in Aulide.</h2>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Short Biography</h3>
<p>Ars Minerva was founded in 2013 by Céline Ricci with a vision for a new performing arts organization that would recreate forgotten music and create multidisciplinary events around early music, while remaining locally rooted and outreach-oriented. </p>
<p>Since its inception, Ars Minerva has presented the modern world premieres of three long-forgotten Venetian operas in San Francisco: La Cleopatra (1662), Le Amazzoni nelle Isole Fortunate (1676) and La Circe (1665).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527287448/gxytpqafqrcwutsrro0o.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Project</h3>
<p>IFIGENIA IN AULIDE - an opera composed by Giovanni Porta in 1738 with a libretto by Apostolo Zeno.</p>
<p><u>Synopsis </u></p>
<p>The Greek army, ready to battle against Troy under the command of King Agamemnon, was detained by contrary winds for several months in the port of Aulis. Agamemnon appealed to the Oracle; and the soothsayer Calchas responded that it would not be possible to sail to Troy, without first placating the wrath of the Goddess Diana with a death, and with the sacrifice of Iphigenia, daughter of Agamemnon.</p>
<h3>Dates and Venues</h3>
<p><strong>November 30th &amp; December 1st at 7.30pm:</strong> Semi-Staged Performances.</p>
<p>At ODC THEATER, San Francisco.</p>
<p>​And a new venue for Ars Minerva!</p>
<p><strong>November 9th at 8pm:</strong> Abridged Concert Version.</p>
<p>At RESONANCE CONCERT SERIES  - First Congregational Church, Berkeley.</p>
<h3>Your Contribution</h3>
<p>Thanks to your donations, we'll be able to recreate a long-lost baroque opera! </p>
<p>Ticket sales cover only about 30% of our budget. In fact, 70% of our production budget comes from individual donations. Your support will help Ars MInerva to remunerate the performing artists, the researching artists and the creating artists. </p>
<p>Bringing back forgotten music to life is an act of beauty and love and an amazing human adventure. Join the team! </p>
<p>Thank you so much for your generosity and for spreading the word.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527287695/s7uhigvkqbqfyj35kjnw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Goals</h3>
<p><u>Cultural and historical preservation</u></p>
<p>By recreating <i>Ifigenia in Aulide</i> in 2018, Ars Minerva will promote cultural heritage and historical preservation. Nowadays, most major opera houses, ensembles and orchestras tend to play a 19<sup>th</sup>-century-dominated standard repertoire. As a consequence, the audience’s experience of classical music can be repetitive and beautiful music from our past remains un-played and unheard. An important part of our operatic heritage remains hidden from audiences and artists.</p>
<p><u>Hire Bay Area artists &amp; young artists</u></p>
<p>For <i>Ifigenia in Aulide</i> we will mainly hire local artists, among which will be some current and former students of the San Francisco Conservatory of Music.</p>
<p>Ars Minerva is proud to primarily collaborate with so many talented artists in the SF Bay Area who fully embrace the process of musical re-creation.</p>
<p><u>Bring new and younger audiences to the opera</u></p>
<p>We aim to engage new audiences for classical music through innovative productions. Our staged productions are modern—we place our re-creations of original Baroque scores in a context that makes them relevant to today’s world. Our audience is growing and we have noticed that young people and students are enthusiastically engaged with our performances.</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p><u>Audiences</u></p>
<p>Our audiences will experience innovative new music reborn from the past, unexpected contrasts with past mindsets, and an incredible energetic and dramatic performance by a vibrant new troupe. It is important for lesser-known operas to be revived. Many are forgotten gems in their own right, and they also provide context for the greatest composers and the eras in which they worked. For instance, we cannot fully understand 17th-century Venetian opera if the only composer we know is Claudio Monteverdi.</p>
<p><u>Participants</u></p>
<p>Our participants will engage in a unique music re-creation process, an intense and high quality work that will demand lots of creativity, being part of an energetic team proud to bring Ifigenia in Aulide back to life. When singers and instrumentalists experience an opera re-creation, they have no references to refer to, no previous performances, no CD to listen to or DVD to watch. They will have to rely on their deep learning about music and their stylistic knowledge of that period of time, and be very creative and flexible during rehearsals.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div>
<p>As a young organization, our big challenges are raising funds and selling tickets, but as in the previous years, we'll do our best to make it. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527287973/djuvzyywcscsmqibyw7l.jpg"" src=""""/>                        </p>

Short Biography
Ars Minerva was founded in 2013 by Céline Ricci with a vision for a new performing arts organization that would recreate forgotten music and create multidisciplinary events around early music, while remaining locally rooted and outreach-oriented. 
Since its inception, Ars Minerva has presented the modern world premieres of three long-forgotten Venetian operas in San Francisco: La Cleopatra (1662), Le Amazzoni nelle Isole Fortunate (1676) and La Circe (1665).

Project
IFIGENIA IN AULIDE - an opera composed by Giovanni Porta in 1738 with a libretto by Apostolo Zeno.
Synopsis 
The Greek army, ready to battle against Troy under the command of King Agamemnon, was detained by contrary winds for several months in the port of Aulis. Agamemnon appealed to the Oracle; and the soothsayer Calchas responded that it would not be possible to sail to Troy, without first placating the wrath of the Goddess Diana with a death, and with the sacrifice of Iphigenia, daughter of Agamemnon.
Dates and Venues
November 30th & December 1st at 7.30pm: Semi-Staged Performances.
At ODC THEATER, San Francisco.
​And a new venue for Ars Minerva!
November 9th at 8pm: Abridged Concert Version.
At RESONANCE CONCERT SERIES  - First Congregational Church, Berkeley.
Your Contribution
Thanks to your donations, we'll be able to recreate a long-lost baroque opera! 
Ticket sales cover only about 30% of our budget. In fact, 70% of our production budget comes from individual donations. Your support will help Ars MInerva to remunerate the performing artists, the researching artists and the creating artists. 
Bringing back forgotten music to life is an act of beauty and love and an amazing human adventure. Join the team! 
Thank you so much for your generosity and for spreading the word.

Goals
Cultural and historical preservation
By recreating Ifigenia in Aulide in 2018, Ars Minerva will promote cultural heritage and historical preservation. Nowadays, most major opera houses, ensembles and orchestras tend to play a 19th-century-dominated standard repertoire. As a consequence, the audience’s experience of classical music can be repetitive and beautiful music from our past remains un-played and unheard. An important part of our operatic heritage remains hidden from audiences and artists.
Hire Bay Area artists & young artists
For Ifigenia in Aulide we will mainly hire local artists, among which will be some current and former students of the San Francisco Conservatory of Music.
Ars Minerva is proud to primarily collaborate with so many talented artists in the SF Bay Area who fully embrace the process of musical re-creation.
Bring new and younger audiences to the opera
We aim to engage new audiences for classical music through innovative productions. Our staged productions are modern—we place our re-creations of original Baroque scores in a context that makes them relevant to today’s world. Our audience is growing and we have noticed that young people and students are enthusiastically engaged with our performances.
Impact
Audiences
Our audiences will experience innovative new music reborn from the past, unexpected contrasts with past mindsets, and an incredible energetic and dramatic performance by a vibrant new troupe. It is important for lesser-known operas to be revived. Many are forgotten gems in their own right, and they also provide context for the greatest composers and the eras in which they worked. For instance, we cannot fully understand 17th-century Venetian opera if the only composer we know is Claudio Monteverdi.
Participants
Our participants will engage in a unique music re-creation process, an intense and high quality work that will demand lots of creativity, being part of an energetic team proud to bring Ifigenia in Aulide back to life. When singers and instrumentalists experience an opera re-creation, they have no references to refer to, no previous performances, no CD to listen to or DVD to watch. They will have to rely on their deep learning about music and their stylistic knowledge of that period of time, and be very creative and flexible during rehearsals.
Risks & Challenges

As a young organization, our big challenges are raising funds and selling tickets, but as in the previous years, we'll do our best to make it. 
                        
Reviews
""Céline Ricci and her Ars Minerva company are a cultural treasure, and we are lucky indeed to have them here in the Bay Area."" THE BERKELEY DAILY PLANET, 2018.
""Outstanding and delightful... a useful reminder of the operatic riches that remain yet uncovered."" THE REVERBERATE HILLS, 2017.
“The Amazons Enchant San Francisco"" OPERA TODAY, 2016.
""The staging and fine singing made for a vibrantly entertaining performance."" SAN FRANCISCO CLASSICAL VOICE, 2016.
""This revival of Castrovillari’s La Cleopatra was a rare treat for San Francisco audiences."" THE BERKELEY DAILY PLANET, 2015.

<h3>About me &amp; ""The Way I Say Your Name""</h3>
<p>Many of you who know me, know that music is and always has been incredibly important, and there is nothing I love more than to play music with other people. Over the past few years, I have focused on my songwriting, honing in on lyrics that speak honestly and directly from my heart. </p>
<p>The songs on this album honor and tribute the women that I look up to in my life, including my Mother, Amy, and my Grandmother's Audrey &amp; Carolyn. I miss both Audrey &amp; Carolyn every day, but this project is teaching me even more about the values of persistence, strength, and love, that they passed on to me. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Still Need &amp; How You Can Help</h3>
<p>The good news is that this album is already in the works. I have the guitar &amp; vocals tracked for all eight songs, but this is just the tip of the iceberg, and there is much more to be done! Here's the breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Community: I am lucky to be surrounded by so many incredible musicians, artists, photographers, engineers, and collaborators that will be recording &amp; making art for this project, and<strong> I am committed to paying these artists</strong> for the time and energy that they put into this project. </li>
<li>Post-production: I am working with two INCREDIBLE musicians and producer-minds, Scott Ferreter &amp; David Lipps, and with the support of this campaign, we can <strong>get those sounds just the way you'll want to hear them. </strong>
</li>
<li>The real-live-thing: although we are living in a digital age, there is still something special and exciting about holding a CD in your hand, liner notes and all! If I meet my goal, not only will I be able to finish the tracks, but <strong>you can even get a copy of the CD delivered straight to your doorstep. </strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I am aiming to raise $4,500</strong> to cover the expenses that I am unable to pay out of pocket. Every cent raised will be put straight back into this project, first supporting the musicians and artists that are making it happen, and any leftover from that will go into CD production.</p>
<p><strong>I am fully committed to this album, and your support means more than I could ever express in words.</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>If the time is not right for you to contribute financially, you can still support the campaign by sharing it on social media and with friends and family. </p>
<p>Thank you for believing in me, believing in this project, and for being a part of it. </p>
<p>With love, gratitude, and giddyness,</p>

<h3>Triangle Blues - Road to Memphis</h3>
<p>Each year the Triangle Blues Society holds the Triangle Blues Challenge to discover the best Blues Musicians in the Triangle (North Carolina) for that year. </p>
<p>This year the winners are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Band - Red Dirt Revelators</b></li>
<li><b>Solo/Duo - Rick Tobey</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The winners qualify to enter the largest blues gathering in the world, held each year in Memphis TN, the International Blues Challenge (IBC). The IBC is nearly a week long event and the musicians need to travel with their instruments, stay in a decent hotel and eat.  It is not terribly expensive, but it is not cheap either. </p>
<p>As Blues Lovers please help these great musicians on their Road to Memphis!</p>
<h3>Straight Talk</h3>
<p>Let me break it down for you. This year, there are five (5) musicians travelling to Memphis.  With the cost of gas these days, some will decide to fly, and some might drive if they cannot figure out a way to carry their instruments on the plane. </p>
<p>The musicians will be in Memphis for six days - so they need food and lodging for about a week. </p>
<p>Here is what we are looking at to help cover the musicians - $4,000</p>
<ul>
<li>Travel...... about $1,500</li>
<li>Lodging.... about $1,000</li>
<li>Food........ about $1,500</li>

<h3>Keep the Music Alive at the Grassroots</h3>
<p>Blues music is part of almost every genre of music today.  You hear blues on TV, in movies, and in advertising.  It is background music, influencing music, and we always have the blues festivals, concerts and local venues with great blues music!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>You've seen us, heard us, and danced with us. The Sustainable Music Project is comprised of talent that has toured the world with some of the world's most popular performers. We have brought together musicians from a variety of genres to create a full length studio album with a New Orleans spin - and we do it to support our own community. Your contributions will help provide stability and higher quality of life for musicians in the New Orleans area. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need your help to complete this album. Your contribution will provide financial support while we finish creating, recording, mastering, and completing this incredible album. Check out our video for song teasers and a little peek behind the scenes! </p>
<p>You'll get updates along the way, and we have some amazing perks for this campaign - everything from a stake in the album to t-shirts and other limited edition merchandise. Your unique perks will be honored no matter how much we raise and we can't wait to take you along on this journey!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Through this Sustainable Music Project, you'll make a direct impact on the lives of working musicians in the New Orleans area. As a cultural hub and rapidly growing city, it's becoming less affordable to live in New Orleans every day. Musicians often live on limited incomes, with few of the benefits afforded to more traditional employees, and navigating rising rents can become a burden. But we do we do what we do out of a passion for our craft and a love of entertaining. By supporting this album, you'll help New Orleans musicians continue to create and perform in a sustainable way.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We believe in this album and the impact it can have on our community. The musicians on this album have long and successful careers in the music industry, touring, recording and performing with acts across the globe. Though there are always risks, we know what it takes to create, market and sell an album. We are committed to creating beautiful, fun, inspired music that touches a wide audience.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you love what we are doing but aren't able to contribute financially, we would love it if you could help us spread the word. Share our campaign on social media, email it to a friend, print out the link and send it to your buddies by passenger pigeon - we appreciate any and all support!</p>

<p>To tell you a little about myself, my name is Gabby Smith (Gabrielle Grace-Anne Smith) and I’m a singer song-writer from a small town in Texas but I currently live in Nashville, Tennessee! I go to school at Trevecca Nazarene University studying worship arts with a philosophy minor. I love making coffee and having deep conversations. I am now moving into my senior year with plans that are bigger than me and I will need your help!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am currently working on fundraising an album and a project that is called, ""This Beautiful Life.” Each song on the album is in chronological order of when I wrote them pertaining to my life! As you listen to the album, my hope is that you journey with me as I go through each season and chapter of life. There are two parts to why its called this “This Beautiful Life”. The first part is to show the theme that your’e allowed to feel how you feel through life and expressing your joys and sorrows are important. Your story is important and throughout all, life is beautiful.  </p>
<p>The second part of “This Beautiful Life” is a project that came to me at 12 in the morning. I’ve always have had a vision of putting out the songs that really are the vulnerable side of me, but also I've realized how important it is to be vulnerable and intentional with people. As life is beautiful in the mess and the in the good, you need people around you. Life is better with the community around you and with this project, I plan on showing off the people that have been in my life.</p>
<p>This looks like showing their gifts as I display mine working together to show that we cannot do life alone. Each person on this project will be displaying their gifts like blogging, podcasts, painting, music, and so on. I will be needing to fund $5000 dollars total for the album and the project. This money will funding the recording, merchandise, and giving back to other people who have helped make this project happen. I'm also hoping to fund other organizations and charities that make this place better. I’m excited to team up with all of my friends who are making vision, come true! Thank you for listening and I am excited to journey with y'all through this!</p>

I'm also hoping to fund other organizations and charities that make this place better. I’m excited to team up with all of my friends who are making vision, come true! Thank you for listening and I am excited to journey with y'all through this!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a teenage singer/songwriter who was poised to become ""the ethnically ambiguous"" Britney Spears. Over the course of 2 years she wrote over 100 songs, put herself through rigorous dance and performance training and eventually got the attention of a couple of record execs of a major pop label. After creating a demo in LA and working with some very talented musicians she was on her way to super mega pop stardom... or not. The endeavor didn't pan out and the young would-be pop tart faded into over a decade of back-up singing for other people's projects. She was fortunate enough to work with some incredibly talented artists (some of whom are friends) and while it was not the most artistically fulfilling it was a wonderful learning experience and provided a well-spring of inspiration. She never stopped writing songs and still held onto the dream of one day releasing her own music without the confines of a label dictating every aspect of her image, sound, vibe, etc. </p>
<p>Fast forward to today and you are all caught up on the very-drawn out process of how I finally ended up laying down my own voice in my own songs. I am so grateful to be working with the insanely talented producer, LYNX and I am truly excited for the world to hear what we are creating.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The reality of producing this EP</p>
<ul>
<li>In total this project will cost 7,000-7,600 with time in the studio, musicians rates who play on the tracks and being variables that can fluctuate. At this point I have invested 1000$ of my own funds into this project and this is where all of you fine folk come in!</li>
<li>The perks of this fundraiser are mostly centered around the EP itself but I also am working with some super amazing local artists to create artwork and imagery that supports the vision of the music. I hope you enjoy these as much as I have enjoyed creating them!</li>
<li>Should this fundraiser not meet the goal the funds will go to producing, recording, mastering and finishing the song that is closest to being finished. All of the funds will still go to the EP, not meeting the goal will just delay the process of completing it. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is important to me because it has been a dream of mine for a long time but also because it is part of a much larger vision. All of the songs on this EP (and the next 2 EPs I have in development) are telling a story that revolve around a character very near and dear to my heart, Avalon. Avalon is an alter-ego, so to speak, that represents the under-represented everywhere. She specifically is a multi-ethnic mother trying to do great things in the world with many odds stacked against and I feel her story is not just her own but the story of many women (or anyone, really) trying to balance what is expected of them and what they feel deeply called to do. She's also a super hero because I can't help myself. :) Currently there is a short film and a comic book in the works to tell her story more in depth and those are set for release later in 2019. Exciting times!</p>

Thanks to all of you, YOU have gotten me into publications like Alternative Addiction, and helped me get licensing agreements with MTV and Discovery. The coolest part for me isn't that though, it's the fact that you guys tell me about what my music means to you, and how it helps you, and how much you love it. That's what makes my heart scream more than anything and want to keep going everyday.</p>
<p>This is why I want to make the best LOYA music video ever, and TOGETHER we're going to raise the $3,000 to make it happen!</p>
<p> </p>

<li>$200-$700 - Photography and PR to help the music video circulate upon release</li>

You guys are all on my team and each one of you mean so much to me. Thanks to all the wonderful support you guys have given me so far, you get me closer and closer along this path. This song and this video are the next step and I can't wait to make it happen with all of you on board.</p>

With your help, we can raise enough money to finish and release our next album! The money we raise will cover recording, marketing and maybe some touring expenses. With your help we can make this dream come true! This is the first step in gaining our independence from having to rely on the financial support of a label to release our music. We are determined to change this cycle, so here we go!







 


What We Need & What You Get Our goal is to raise 30,000 dollars. This funding would be what we need to finish our album and properly advertise it on the market so we can be heard. The recording and marketing process is expensive from start to finish.  We have put everything into writing this album, now we need to finish it and get it out to you! 
Recording Costs:
Studio Rental
Engineer Pay
Producer Pay
Mixing Engineer
Mastering House
Misc. Equipment Rental
Marketing Costs:
Album Artwork Creation
Album Manufacturing
Music Video 
Music Video Marketing
Radio Marketing
Publicist
Online Marketing 
If we exceed our funding goal, that money would go towards our touring expenses, gas, food (Taco Bell), transportation, lodging, etc. You know how much we love coming to your town and putting on a show! So with your help, we can make all this happen!
Of course there are awesome perks for your financial support! You can check them all out on the right side of this page! 
We have created some exclusive merchandise that is only available here on Indiegogo!  Hoodies, T-shirts, Posters, etc. we will never be printing these items again! 



We also came up with some really cool perks for you! Customized signed guitars, framed hand written lyrics, record with us on one of our songs, or how about we come to your pad and dj your party of a lifetime or a backstage pass good for life!  

The Impact
 The impact this campaign will have on our music career is priceless. This is going to change the future of how we do music, this is going to give us, the artists, the ability to make decisions for ourselves. We won't have to do what the guy in the suit says, we can give YOU our fans what YOU want! This is our future, we NEED your help claiming it!
    Risks & Challenges We have seen our share of challenges in the past and I'm sure we will have plenty more. We have taken some hard hits, been up against plenty obstacles but we ALWAYS come out on top because this is what we live for. Our history proves we won't fail we fight through it because BC 13 will never die!! We take risks like this because in the end we know it will pay off!

<h3>So this is the story, honey<br/>I do stuff I shouldn't do...</h3>
<p>I made this tune.</p>
<p>NOW it needs a video to get properly promoted!!!<br/><br/>So this is (obviously, what else could it be?) a thing about true love.</p>
<p>The truest love you can figure, as a matter of fact. That implies... <br/>I wrote this thing some 12 years back, when I was broke and thought music could be a way of making up some quick cash, but I really needed some inspiration. My life was faaaaar too dull and peacefull for any real storymaking...</p>
<p>So to be able to write this tune, I fell desperately in love, (the right thing to do, no? Nothing sells like a true-love love story!) <br/>And as we all know: It is allways a good way to solve economical and practical problems to fall head over heels in love... with someone you shouldn't, who is with some other chap and who wouldn't really, while one is trying to fix whatever love- and lifemess one's already in.<br/><br/>Now...<br/>That kinda worked out... For a while.<br/>True love was formally established and confirmed.<br/>Thus: No more need for messy tunes. And love trumps everything, so gone was my economical needs as well. Oh Bliss!<br/><br/>And then life moved on, and as I fell in love with one (true love, of course) and she with another (even truer love than all the mentioned loves, I'd say) and we with eachother again and...<br/>Well you get the idea. Tons of materials for silly soapoperas and larger than life epics, for sure! I had finally aquired an interesting life!<br/>But now I had no time for making songs and videos about it.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I had that issue fixed.</p>
<p><br/>Now... If any - or all - of the above had been true, (the love, the story-about-the-story, or anything even vaguelly resembling either) life would've been a real and true and pretty mess, I guess. WIth a bit of stress.<br/>But fortunately, that's not how it all panned out, I wouldn't have known how to handle all that drama.</p>
<p><br/>This is still a fun string of thoughts to play if I may, I'd say, so just for the heck of it... I do I do I do.<br/>Even in all its distant abstractions and unrealistic perspectives.<br/><br/>But the tune itself is very real and has kinda stuck as the years have passed, and I moved from making music to quickfix whatever economical needs I might have had, to imagery. Trying to solve pretty much the same mess, if it ever was present. Or not when it wasn't</p>
<p>And finally, I had gone full circle, with a bit of time on my hand and this old tune, which I really think could make it, if I only had a video to promote it. Check it out on youtube (the link is on the top here), or make a donation and download the mp3...</p>
<p><br/>So... because all of this didn't really happen, I was about to cancel the campaign, but as I was sitting here dreaming away and writing all this, real-life was probing me with a stick! I was given a parkingticket - out of the blue, and my world allmost fell apart.</p>
<p>NOW it's personal. I (as I see it) got a ticket for starting this campaign, and as a matter of fact, I have a few others to pay, when I think of it, so I guess I'll just have to go on with this. Nothing else would make any sense at all, at this time and place.</p>
<p>(yup, I'll upload an image as a proof...)</p>
<p>And as a result of what could have happened if any or all or allmost nothing of the above was true, I need to clean up my act and pay, and what would be a better way to do that, than to launch a gogo campaign to spread the beautiful message of simple and pure and eternal and uncomplicated love to the world?<br/>And fund a proper musicvideo for the tune.</p>
<p>This campaign suddenly gained a larger than life purpose, that is:<br/>Rise the money needed for paying the ticket (which kinda involves paying off some older stiff that I have aquired in the pursue of true and unfaltering love). So I started a bit of budgeting.<br/>What has this song cost me?<br/>And what do I need to get even and make that video and pay that ticket?</p>
<p>And (as a by-the-by), I wouldn't mind falling in love again - so I should factor that in, too - when doing my calculus, but who would ever fall in love with a person with an unpaid parkingticket? <br/><br/>This calls for action!</p>
<p><img alt=""Image of the notorious parkingticket"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/819412_10151471049585126_957138455_o.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""The ticket""/><br/><strong>Next up, was deciding what my goals are...<br/>A bit of budgeting.</strong></p>
<p>Well... I have some friends and a camera (...and a parking ticket), but still kit and studio and people tend to have some cost....<br/><br/>Parking tickets so far: <br/>300$<br/><br/>Parking tickets for the rest of the project:</p>
<p>300$<br/>(I'll really try hard not to get one each day!)<br/><br/>The ""falling in love"" part needed to write this tune and make the video, has been rather expensive. Around 250k$ a pop, and still counting. And I have to factor in falling in love once more to make the campaign a success. So I guess with a bit of luck and adjusting for inflation, that'll come in at 900k$ all in all:</p>
<p>So far:<br/>900.600$<br/><br/>Whew, this is quite a challenge allready...<br/>But let's not forget that bigger wonders have happened in the music industry!<br/>Keep the faith. I have one shot at this!<br/>(If not, I'll have to find another, right?)<br/><br/>So, that's tickets and love. Basics... But still no video.<br/>Now... I spent a couple of months doing this tune and got a lot of my musician friends to give me freebs playing, so I guess that is done for allready, but I should should factor in 20% to the musicians, or I guess tthe friendships might end in the expense account - given the tremendous success I foresee for this tune, if I manage to make the video, and we don't want that do we?<br/><br/>Now... Producing this video...<br/><br/>It will move on slowly. And possibly in several iterations, depending on the funding of-course.<br/>I need some in-loveable girls (don't we all, if it isn't men we're looking for) a bit of lights, and something to eat.<br/><br/>I guess I'll be shooting for 3 days with a friendly budget of 1500 $ each.<br/>That'll do for the catering, and a few fees to people attending.<br/><br/>I plan to use a car for 3 days doing timelapses of driving.<br/>That's gonna be 350$ for petrol, food and sleeping each day.<br/><br/>1050$<br/><br/>AND<br/>I'll need to edit and work this thing out in post.<br/>That's about a week more work. Let's put those days down at 500$ a shot, so I can eat, get a parking ticket, have a smoke &amp; paying the studio rent.<br/><br/>3500$</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So that gives us this budget:<br/><br/>Lovestories + anticipated future loveproblems: 900.000,- $</p>
<p>Parking tickets:                                              600,- $</p>
<p>Shooting people:                                          4.500,- $</p>
<p>Shooting roads:                                            1.050,- $</p>
<p>Post                                                            3.500,- $</p>
<p>And I'd like to grab a beer and some <br/>smokes tonight and live in Norway                    250,- $</p>
<p>Musicians (20% of the above)                     181.980,- $        </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have some other stuff I could put in here, but I guess this will have to do.<br/>That's a grand total of:                            1.091.880,- $</p>
<p>That's a bit of cash... <br/>But I guess that's what I'll need to cover my expenses.</p>
<p><strong>NOW</strong><br/>Gogo has this policy of witholding a percentage of the funds if you don't reach your goal. That'd be 9%, but if you reach it, they only take 4%, so I guess I'll set the goal at 500$, and just hope to be slightly overfunded.<br/><br/>Then paypal takes another 4'ish%, so I have to factor that in too, if I wanna pay my tickets.<br/><br/>All in all we're lookin at another 10% on top of the above, and there's allways other unexpected expenses (another 10%)...<br/><br/>Total campaign goal looks thus to be:<br/><em><strong>1.310.256,- USD</strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em><br/></em></strong>But WAIT!!!<br/>Let's recap!<br/>I need:<br/>906.400,- in hard liquid cash to pay my 150$ parking ticket, pay for past and incomming affairs AND reach world domination, right?<br/><br/>And then there is:<br/>20% for musicians<br/>10% for campaign fees<br/>10% for unexpected expenses<br/><br/>But I still allmost forgot - that'd be disastrous!:<br/>28% for government tax<br/>20% for company overhead.<br/><br/>That means that my available cut to pay parking tickets, videoproduction and past and future affairs only represents 12% of the money needed to pay the 150$ fine aquired.<br/><br/>The actual gross ambition for this campaign is thus<br/><br/><em><strong>7.553.333,85 $</strong></em><br/><br/>Oh... Geee...</p>
<p>Glad someone taught me budgeting! <br/>The last little thing to factor in is the production of and maintainment of this campaign... <br/>Well... Let's not get greedy here, shall we? I'll throw that in as another freeb!<br/><br/>I am sooo glad this is not a true storry, because if it was, it appears like I would be rather heavily messed up! <br/><br/>So... I have a number...<br/>That's kinda <strong>125.888,90 $</strong> a day for the campaign period...<br/>Now... That's gonna be challenging...<br/>This thingy better go viral!<br/><br/><strong>So this is how that works:</strong><br/>If you like the campaign/music/video or just think that this is kinda fun'ish, you spread this youtube video, llink to the campaign and buy as much or as little as you can/want/need/desire of the perks.<br/><br/>Send it out to friends and relatives, because - realistically - I myself don't have 7,5 mill friends to ask for a buck each, and that's what I'd have needed, if there was an easy way to fund all this... :)<br/><br/><strong>Fianlly...</strong></p>
<p>I have a few issues as to perks and how to make them atractive, but I am open for suggestions... <br/>Obviously, with a start-off deficit of this magnitude, it will be hard to offer stuff that costs money, and time is hard too, as I have to finnish the movie, and work on my obnoxious pop-star-to-be chops. And I cannot dance, like the Gangnam dude (I could try, though...)<br/><br/>So I'll start with a few perks and add as I get suggestions as to what people would like from this.<br/><br/>One of my issues here is that a lot of what I do is public anyway, and I am really not into starting off on a secretive lifestyle just now...<br/><br/><strong>And really final words...</strong><br/>There are some suggestions from gogo as to keeping things realistic, and I really try to do that, but there are conflicting realities involved...<br/><br/>On one hand, there is the reality of what is needed to make this video and pay the parking-ticket. That is conservatively in the 7.5 mill$ region.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there is the realistic goal of a campaign like this and keeping the gogo fees down...<br/><br/>So I have chosen to let both these realities reflect in the text, the video and the campaign...<br/><br/>Presumably I can rise the goal as funding evolves.<br/><br/><strong>A few more final words:</strong><br/>I need to get this thing into mainstream media as well, to reach these goals, so please bomb your local newspapers, ask for the tune on radiostations and request the video for MTV and other music shows.<br/><br/>I'll even show up for an interview, if requested.<br/><br/>As I haven't practised my singing chops for the last 10 years, I don't think the live/accoustic thingy is a good plan, but if paid sufficiently, I'll even show up for that!<br/><br/>I'll make that a perk...<br/><br/><br/><strong>OK... Now I'm done... ! (Really promise)<br/></strong>So what do I do if I get overfunded (that is beyond the 7.5 mill$ mark, just to be clear...)<br/><br/>I guess I'll rent some grip... Like rails or maybe a moviebird to get some cool shots in there...  I might also buy a house and a car, if the overfunding is sufficient, and practice my obnoxious popstar chops. But I really hadn't plan to do all that before the tune itself (and the video I wanna make) is a huge hit...<br/><br/>I guess I could try to divide my eternal and unfaltering love on a couple of more individuals, and I might grab an extra beer.<br/><br/>Dunno really, haven't thought that far.<br/>But I'll keep you posted!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So...</p>
<p>Now it's fully up to you!<br/>Make my dream come true!<br/><br/>Cheers!<br/><br/><strong>Gunleik</strong></p>

I have some other stuff I could put in here, but I guess this will have to do.That's a grand total of:                            1.091.880,- $
That's a bit of cash... But I guess that's what I'll need to cover my expenses.
NOWGogo has this policy of witholding a percentage of the funds if you don't reach your goal. That'd be 9%, but if you reach it, they only take 4%, so I guess I'll set the goal at 500$, and just hope to be slightly overfunded.Then paypal takes another 4'ish%, so I have to factor that in too, if I wanna pay my tickets.All in all we're lookin at another 10% on top of the above, and there's allways other unexpected expenses (another 10%)...Total campaign goal looks thus to be:1.310.256,- USD
But WAIT!!!Let's recap!I need:906.400,- in hard liquid cash to pay my 150$ parking ticket, pay for past and incomming affairs AND reach world domination, right?And then there is:20% for musicians10% for campaign fees10% for unexpected expensesBut I still allmost forgot - that'd be disastrous!:28% for government tax20% for company overhead.That means that my available cut to pay parking tickets, videoproduction and past and future affairs only represents 12% of the money needed to pay the 150$ fine aquired.The actual gross ambition for this campaign is thus7.553.333,85 $Oh... Geee...
Glad someone taught me budgeting! The last little thing to factor in is the production of and maintainment of this campaign... Well... Let's not get greedy here, shall we? I'll throw that in as another freeb!I am sooo glad this is not a true storry, because if it was, it appears like I would be rather heavily messed up! So... I have a number...That's kinda 125.888,90 $ a day for the campaign period...Now... That's gonna be challenging...This thingy better go viral!So this is how that works:If you like the campaign/music/video or just think that this is kinda fun'ish, you spread this youtube video, llink to the campaign and buy as much or as little as you can/want/need/desire of the perks.Send it out to friends and relatives, because - realistically - I myself don't have 7,5 mill friends to ask for a buck each, and that's what I'd have needed, if there was an easy way to fund all this... :)Fianlly...
I have a few issues as to perks and how to make them atractive, but I am open for suggestions... Obviously, with a start-off deficit of this magnitude, it will be hard to offer stuff that costs money, and time is hard too, as I have to finnish the movie, and work on my obnoxious pop-star-to-be chops. And I cannot dance, like the Gangnam dude (I could try, though...)So I'll start with a few perks and add as I get suggestions as to what people would like from this.One of my issues here is that a lot of what I do is public anyway, and I am really not into starting off on a secretive lifestyle just now...And really final words...There are some suggestions from gogo as to keeping things realistic, and I really try to do that, but there are conflicting realities involved...On one hand, there is the reality of what is needed to make this video and pay the parking-ticket. That is conservatively in the 7.5 mill$ region.On the other hand, there is the realistic goal of a campaign like this and keeping the gogo fees down...So I have chosen to let both these realities reflect in the text, the video and the campaign...Presumably I can rise the goal as funding evolves.A few more final words:I need to get this thing into mainstream media as well, to reach these goals, so please bomb your local newspapers, ask for the tune on radiostations and request the video for MTV and other music shows.I'll even show up for an interview, if requested.As I haven't practised my singing chops for the last 10 years, I don't think the live/accoustic thingy is a good plan, but if paid sufficiently, I'll even show up for that!I'll make that a perk...OK... Now I'm done... ! (Really promise)So what do I do if I get overfunded (that is beyond the 7.5 mill$ mark, just to be clear...)I guess I'll rent some grip... Like rails or maybe a moviebird to get some cool shots in there...  I might also buy a house and a car, if the overfunding is sufficient, and practice my obnoxious popstar chops. But I really hadn't plan to do all that before the tune itself (and the video I wanna make) is a huge hit...I guess I could try to divide my eternal and unfaltering love on a couple of more individuals, and I might grab an extra beer.Dunno really, haven't thought that far.But I'll keep you posted!
 
So...
Now it's fully up to you!Make my dream come true!Cheers!Gunleik",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>More on Jouyssance Early Music Ensemble<br/>
</h3>
<p>Jouyssance Early Music Ensemble is
a Los Angeles-based choral group dedicated to revitalizing music of the Medieval, Renaissance
and early Baroque periods. Under the artistic direction of Dr. Nicole Baker, Jouyssance
presents innovative public performances demonstrating artistic excellence and informed by deep
musicological scholarship to make this extraordinary and often-neglected
repertoire available and accessible to contemporary audiences. Jouyssance is
the principal program of the Foundation of the Neo-Renaissance, a 501(c)(3)
non-profit organization founded in 1967. </p>
<p>Jouyssance performs
an annual series of three concert programs in the greater Los Angeles area. The
group honors the
tradition of historically informed
performance practice,
seeking to re-create the music as it might have sounded at the time it was
written. Performances frequently include accompaniment on period
instruments. </p>
<p>The repertoire includes
music from the 9th through the
early 17th centuries, often featuring such major figures as Machaut, Dufay,
Josquin, Palestrina, Lassus, and Monteverdi. The group explores complex works
rarely attempted by similar groups, such as Brumel’s 12-part <i>Missa Et Ecce Terrae Motus</i> and
Carver’s <i>Mass</i> for six voices.<span>  Concerts showcase music not only from
every corner of Europe, but also from non-Western traditions from around the
globe, such as Canadian First Nations, Mexico and Guatemala, Bolivia and Peru,
the Ukraine, Ethiopia, Byzantium, India, China, and the Philippines. </span></p>
<p>Jouyssance aims to educate audiences in
ways that engage and inspire. During concerts, Dr.
Baker shares her insights into the repertoire with the audience,
frequently peppering her comments with humorous,
informative anecdotes that
help bring the music and its composers to life.  Program notes for each
concert include texts
and translations that supplement the discussion with scholarly rigor.  <br/></p>
<p>Jouyssance is recognized as one
of the premiere vocal ensembles in Southern California, and is the only
regularly performing vocal group in Los Angeles dedicated to exploring music
before 1650. Jouyssance has released two CDs, <i>Jouyssance Early Music Ensemble</i>
and <i>A Tour of Christmases Past</i>. Both are available for purchase on iTunes and
Amazon.com. </p>

<h3>Who we are and what we do (español abajo)</h3>
<p>We are a nonprofit community group called ""Agrupación Educacional waldorf pichilemu"" which has been in activity since 2012.</p>
<p>We are located in Pichilemu, a small city in the sixth region of Chile. Pichilemu is magical village that mixes the countryside and the sea, is rich in its traditions, ancient trades, fishing, farming and arts.</p>
</div><p> Our mission is to give children and young people of the community, the opportunity to discover and develop their different abilities and skills, to know and learn different trades, and to strengthen their talents that will be useful to them during their life.</p><div>
<p>Our initiative aims to deliver all the other enriching learning, such as arts, sports and crafts at the appropriate pace that does not alter the child's rhythm and balanced development.</p>
<p>In our space children work the ground, carpentry, ceramics, plastic arts, textiles, pastry and cooking, surfing and swimming, opening much of this classes, with no costs, to the whole community of the town.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Chile is going through a difficult time with education. Conventional schools stresses children with only intellectual knowledge, memory learning, and is every year giving less importance to the learning of art, music and sports. More often we can see stressed children, unhappy, depressed, with lack of creativity, full of homework's and no time to practice whatever hobbie they like to do. </p>
<p>The practices that are offering the majority of conventional schools does not correspond with a quality education that respects the infancy of the children, and that focuses the learning from the freedom of choice, the existential learning, the respect, the love for the nature and the work of the emotions and of the affective links.</p>
<p>These is why a group of parents and teachers got together 4 years ago and form these non profit community organization, to offer children from all pichilemu, the possibility of learning and practicing all what conventional education is no longer interested in teaching children. Arts and handwork traditional to these town (clay work, woodwork, wool weaving work), sports. Because of its high costs, we have not been able to teach our children musical instruments, they only practice the flute. We see in them the interest and need of knowing other instruments, to have more time of music classes and enrich themselves with its magic.</p>
<p><strong>What We Want To Do</strong></p>
<p>Since a year ago, our dream has been to build a music room, so that the children can learn different types of instruments such as the piano, violin, guitar, percussion, singing, among others. This will give them the opportunity to approach the world of music.</p>
<p>Locally there is no place where children can learn music nor instruments, and we believe that our children should have  the opportunity to get close to music, learn a musical instrument; to make music with others; to learn to sing; and to have the opportunity to progress to the next level of excellence if they wish to, and become virtuous musicians. What would happen if one of these kids have a marvelous talent for music, but never have the opportunity to get close to  it? You can make these happen and help the next generation of musicians develop. With one action, you could change someones future.</p>
<p>With your valuable help, we could make this dream possible. And give our kids their dreamed space for making music, much of them would otherwise never have the opportunity to learn a musical instrument. We need to build a music room, and purchase musical instruments.</p>
<p><strong>Why music?</strong></p>
<p>Theres are lots of researches that prove all the benefits of music. Whether a child is meant to be the next Bach or more likely to sing  solos in the shower, they all  benefit from some form of music education. Research shows that learning the do-re-mis can help children excel in ways beyond the basic ABCs. Making music involves more than the voice or fingers playing an instrument; a child learning about music has to tap into multiple skill sets, often simultaneously. </p>
<p>Music making can be a dynamic social learning experience. Making music together, children learn to work as a team, while they  contribute to the song in their own way. At the same time, music helps children learn that together they can make something larger than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>For children, music provides many, many benefits. Experts agree, there are lots of good things about letting your child learn to play an instrument.</p>
<p>-It will boost their brain power</p>
<p>-It helps them socially</p>
<p>-It's a confidence builder</p>
<p>-It teaches patience</p>
<p>-        It teaches discipline</p>
<p>-          It's a great form of expression</p>
<p>-          Creatively music is good for the body, soul and spirit.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We'd like to give every  children in pichilemu a  chance to learn music at no cost to them.</p>
<p>We need  15.000 usd, for building and bying equipment for a complete music room (building a classroom for rehearsal and performance space, and buy all types of instruments, air, strings, percussion, piano). If we do not obtain the full fund, we will be happy to be able to buy some musical instruments, and start teaching music.</p>
<p>Whatever you are able to give: $10, $50, or $200, we promise it will make an impact.</p>
<p>Our nonprofit community has  social network accounts ( Facebook, instagram) and we will post the music classes so you will be able to see the progress of the kids in music class. </p>
<p>If you support our campaign, the children will send you different gifts, mostly handmade by them. Since we are located in Chile in the far end of south america, depending on how much you donate on our cause, which gift or perk we will send you. </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Sharing this campaign with your friends can really make a difference. Please help us get the word out and make some noise about our campaign. Like us on Facebook,  forward our campaign on to all of your friends.<font><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">If you </span>can't help us donating funds, you could help us telling your contacts our story, sharing, reposting or emailing the link to these Indiegogo proyect, or any other idea that you have will be really helpful and appreciate.

<p> Thank you for your time and help!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                   <strong>Quiénes somos y qué hacemos</strong></p>
<p>Somos un grupo comunitario sin fines de lucro llamado ""Agrupación Educacional waldorf pichilemu"" que ha estado en actividad desde 2012.</p>
<p>Estamos ubicados en Pichilemu, una pequeña ciudad de la sexta región de Chile. Pichilemu es un pueblo mágico que mezcla el campo y el mar, es rico en sus tradiciones, oficios antiguos, la pesca, la agricultura y las artes.</p>
<p>Nuestra misión es dar a los niños y jóvenes de la comunidad la oportunidad de descubrir y desarrollar sus diferentes capacidades y habilidades, conocer y aprender diferentes oficios y fortalecer sus talentos que les serán útiles durante su vida.</p>
<p>Nuestra iniciativa tiene como objetivo ofrecer a todos los demás aprendizajes enriquecedores, como artes, deportes y artesanías, al ritmo adecuado que no altera el ritmo del niño y su desarrollo equilibrado.</p>
<p>En nuestro espacio los niños trabajan la tierra, la carpintería, la cerámica, las artes plásticas, los textiles, la pastelería y la cocina, el surf y la natación, abriendo gran parte de estas clases, sin costo, a toda la comunidad del pueblo.</p>
<p><br/><strong>El impacto</strong></p>
<p>Chile atraviesa un momento difícil con la educación. Las escuelas convencionales hacen hincapié en los niños que sólo tienen conocimientos intelectuales, aprenden la memoria y cada año dan menos importancia al aprendizaje del arte, la música y los deportes. Más a menudo podemos ver a niños estresados, infelices, deprimidos, con falta de creatividad, llenos de tareas y sin tiempo para practicar lo que quieran hacer hobbie.</p>
<p>Las prácticas que ofrecen la mayoría de las escuelas convencionales no se corresponden con una educación de calidad que respete la infancia de los niños, y que enfoca el aprendizaje desde la libertad de elección, el aprendizaje existencial, el respeto, el amor por la naturaleza y el Trabajo de las emociones y de los vínculos afectivos.</p>
<p>Es por eso que un grupo de padres y maestros se reunieron hace 4 años y forman esta organización comunitaria sin fines de lucro, para ofrecer a los niños de todos los pichilemu, la posibilidad de aprender y practicar todo lo que la educación convencional ya no está interesada en enseñar a los niños. Artes y trabajo manual tradicional a estas localidades (arcilla, carpintería, tejidos de lana), deportes. Debido a sus altos costos, no hemos podido enseñar a nuestros niños instrumentos musicales, solo practican la flauta. Vemos en ellos el interés y la necesidad de conocer otros instrumentos, tener más tiempo de clases de música y enriquecerse con su magia.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Lo que queremos hacer</strong></p>
<p>Desde hace un año, nuestro sueño ha sido construir una sala de música, para que los niños puedan aprender diferentes tipos de instrumentos como el piano, el violín, la guitarra, la percusión, el canto, entre otros. Esto les dará la oportunidad de acercarse al mundo de la música.</p>
<p>Localmente no hay lugar donde los niños puedan aprender música ni instrumentos, y creemos que nuestros hijos deben tener la oportunidad de acercarse a la música, aprender un instrumento musical; Hacer música con otros; Aprender a cantar; Y tener la oportunidad de progresar al siguiente nivel de excelencia si lo desean, y convertirse en músicos virtuosos. ¿Qué pasaría si uno de estos niños tiene un talento maravilloso para la música, pero nunca tiene la oportunidad de acercarse a ella? Usted puede hacer que estos sucedan y ayudar a la próxima generación de músicos se desarrollan. Con una acción, usted podría cambiar su futuro.</p>
<p>Con su valiosa ayuda, podríamos hacer posible este sueño. Y dar a nuestros hijos su espacio soñado para hacer música, muchos de ellos de otro modo nunca tendrían la oportunidad de aprender un instrumento musical. Necesitamos construir una sala de música y comprar instrumentos musicales.</p>
<p><br/><strong>¿Por qué la música?</strong></p>
<p>Hay muchas investigaciones que demuestran todos los beneficios de la música. Si un niño está destinado a ser el próximo Bach o más propensos a cantar solos en la ducha, todos se benefician de alguna forma de educación musical. La investigación demuestra que aprender el do-re-mis puede ayudar a los niños a sobresalir en formas más allá del ABC básico. Hacer música implica algo más que la voz o los dedos tocando un instrumento; Un niño que aprende acerca de la música tiene que aprovechar múltiples conjuntos de habilidades, a menudo simultáneamente.</p>
<p>La fabricación de música puede ser una experiencia de aprendizaje social dinámica. Haciendo música juntos, los niños aprenden a trabajar en equipo, mientras que contribuyen a la canción a su manera. Al mismo tiempo, la música ayuda a los niños a aprender que juntos pueden hacer algo más grande que la suma de sus partes.</p>
<p>Para los niños, la música ofrece muchos, muchos beneficios. Los expertos están de acuerdo, hay muchas cosas buenas acerca de dejar que su hijo aprenda a tocar un instrumento.</p>
<p>- Aumentará su poder cerebral</p>
<p>-Los ayuda socialmente</p>
<p>-Es un constructor de confianza</p>
<p>-Enseña paciencia</p>
<p>- Enseña disciplina</p>
<p>- Es una gran forma de expresión</p>
<p>- Creativamente la música es buena para el cuerpo, alma y espíritu.</p>
<p> </p>

We are a nonprofit community group called ""Agrupación Educacional waldorf pichilemu"" which has been in activity since 2012.
We are located in Pichilemu, a small city in the sixth region of Chile. Pichilemu is magical village that mixes the countryside and the sea, is rich in its traditions, ancient trades, fishing, farming and arts.
 Our mission is to give children and young people of the community, the opportunity to discover and develop their different abilities and skills, to know and learn different trades, and to strengthen their talents that will be useful to them during their life.
Our initiative aims to deliver all the other enriching learning, such as arts, sports and crafts at the appropriate pace that does not alter the child's rhythm and balanced development.
In our space children work the ground, carpentry, ceramics, plastic arts, textiles, pastry and cooking, surfing and swimming, opening much of this classes, with no costs, to the whole community of the town.
The Impact
Chile is going through a difficult time with education. Conventional schools stresses children with only intellectual knowledge, memory learning, and is every year giving less importance to the learning of art, music and sports. More often we can see stressed children, unhappy, depressed, with lack of creativity, full of homework's and no time to practice whatever hobbie they like to do. 
The practices that are offering the majority of conventional schools does not correspond with a quality education that respects the infancy of the children, and that focuses the learning from the freedom of choice, the existential learning, the respect, the love for the nature and the work of the emotions and of the affective links.
These is why a group of parents and teachers got together 4 years ago and form these non profit community organization, to offer children from all pichilemu, the possibility of learning and practicing all what conventional education is no longer interested in teaching children. Arts and handwork traditional to these town (clay work, woodwork, wool weaving work), sports. Because of its high costs, we have not been able to teach our children musical instruments, they only practice the flute. We see in them the interest and need of knowing other instruments, to have more time of music classes and enrich themselves with its magic.
What We Want To Do
Since a year ago, our dream has been to build a music room, so that the children can learn different types of instruments such as the piano, violin, guitar, percussion, singing, among others. This will give them the opportunity to approach the world of music.
Locally there is no place where children can learn music nor instruments, and we believe that our children should have  the opportunity to get close to music, learn a musical instrument; to make music with others; to learn to sing; and to have the opportunity to progress to the next level of excellence if they wish to, and become virtuous musicians. What would happen if one of these kids have a marvelous talent for music, but never have the opportunity to get close to  it? You can make these happen and help the next generation of musicians develop. With one action, you could change someones future.
With your valuable help, we could make this dream possible. And give our kids their dreamed space for making music, much of them would otherwise never have the opportunity to learn a musical instrument. We need to build a music room, and purchase musical instruments.
Why music?
Theres are lots of researches that prove all the benefits of music. Whether a child is meant to be the next Bach or more likely to sing  solos in the shower, they all  benefit from some form of music education. Research shows that learning the do-re-mis can help children excel in ways beyond the basic ABCs. Making music involves more than the voice or fingers playing an instrument; a child learning about music has to tap into multiple skill sets, often simultaneously. 
Music making can be a dynamic social learning experience. Making music together, children learn to work as a team, while they  contribute to the song in their own way. At the same time, music helps children learn that together they can make something larger than the sum of its parts.
For children, music provides many, many benefits. Experts agree, there are lots of good things about letting your child learn to play an instrument.
-It will boost their brain power
-It helps them socially
-It's a confidence builder
-It teaches patience
-        It teaches discipline
-          It's a great form of expression
-          Creatively music is good for the body, soul and spirit.
What We Need & What You Get
We'd like to give every  children in pichilemu a  chance to learn music at no cost to them.
We need  15.000 usd, for building and bying equipment for a complete music room (building a classroom for rehearsal and performance space, and buy all types of instruments, air, strings, percussion, piano). If we do not obtain the full fund, we will be happy to be able to buy some musical instruments, and start teaching music.
Whatever you are able to give: $10, $50, or $200, we promise it will make an impact.
Our nonprofit community has  social network accounts ( Facebook, instagram) and we will post the music classes so you will be able to see the progress of the kids in music class. 
If you support our campaign, the children will send you different gifts, mostly handmade by them. Since we are located in Chile in the far end of south america, depending on how much you donate on our cause, which gift or perk we will send you.

                                   Quiénes somos y qué hacemos
Somos un grupo comunitario sin fines de lucro llamado ""Agrupación Educacional waldorf pichilemu"" que ha estado en actividad desde 2012.
Estamos ubicados en Pichilemu, una pequeña ciudad de la sexta región de Chile. Pichilemu es un pueblo mágico que mezcla el campo y el mar, es rico en sus tradiciones, oficios antiguos, la pesca, la agricultura y las artes.
Nuestra misión es dar a los niños y jóvenes de la comunidad la oportunidad de descubrir y desarrollar sus diferentes capacidades y habilidades, conocer y aprender diferentes oficios y fortalecer sus talentos que les serán útiles durante su vida.
Nuestra iniciativa tiene como objetivo ofrecer a todos los demás aprendizajes enriquecedores, como artes, deportes y artesanías, al ritmo adecuado que no altera el ritmo del niño y su desarrollo equilibrado.
En nuestro espacio los niños trabajan la tierra, la carpintería, la cerámica, las artes plásticas, los textiles, la pastelería y la cocina, el surf y la natación, abriendo gran parte de estas clases, sin costo, a toda la comunidad del pueblo.
El impacto
Chile atraviesa un momento difícil con la educación. Las escuelas convencionales hacen hincapié en los niños que sólo tienen conocimientos intelectuales, aprenden la memoria y cada año dan menos importancia al aprendizaje del arte, la música y los deportes. Más a menudo podemos ver a niños estresados, infelices, deprimidos, con falta de creatividad, llenos de tareas y sin tiempo para practicar lo que quieran hacer hobbie.
Las prácticas que ofrecen la mayoría de las escuelas convencionales no se corresponden con una educación de calidad que respete la infancia de los niños, y que enfoca el aprendizaje desde la libertad de elección, el aprendizaje existencial, el respeto, el amor por la naturaleza y el Trabajo de las emociones y de los vínculos afectivos.
Es por eso que un grupo de padres y maestros se reunieron hace 4 años y forman esta organización comunitaria sin fines de lucro, para ofrecer a los niños de todos los pichilemu, la posibilidad de aprender y practicar todo lo que la educación convencional ya no está interesada en enseñar a los niños. Artes y trabajo manual tradicional a estas localidades (arcilla, carpintería, tejidos de lana), deportes. Debido a sus altos costos, no hemos podido enseñar a nuestros niños instrumentos musicales, solo practican la flauta. Vemos en ellos el interés y la necesidad de conocer otros instrumentos, tener más tiempo de clases de música y enriquecerse con su magia.
 
 
Lo que queremos hacer
Desde hace un año, nuestro sueño ha sido construir una sala de música, para que los niños puedan aprender diferentes tipos de instrumentos como el piano, el violín, la guitarra, la percusión, el canto, entre otros. Esto les dará la oportunidad de acercarse al mundo de la música.
Localmente no hay lugar donde los niños puedan aprender música ni instrumentos, y creemos que nuestros hijos deben tener la oportunidad de acercarse a la música, aprender un instrumento musical; Hacer música con otros; Aprender a cantar; Y tener la oportunidad de progresar al siguiente nivel de excelencia si lo desean, y convertirse en músicos virtuosos. ¿Qué pasaría si uno de estos niños tiene un talento maravilloso para la música, pero nunca tiene la oportunidad de acercarse a ella? Usted puede hacer que estos sucedan y ayudar a la próxima generación de músicos se desarrollan. Con una acción, usted podría cambiar su futuro.
Con su valiosa ayuda, podríamos hacer posible este sueño. Y dar a nuestros hijos su espacio soñado para hacer música, muchos de ellos de otro modo nunca tendrían la oportunidad de aprender un instrumento musical. Necesitamos construir una sala de música y comprar instrumentos musicales.
¿Por qué la música?
Hay muchas investigaciones que demuestran todos los beneficios de la música. Si un niño está destinado a ser el próximo Bach o más propensos a cantar solos en la ducha, todos se benefician de alguna forma de educación musical. La investigación demuestra que aprender el do-re-mis puede ayudar a los niños a sobresalir en formas más allá del ABC básico. Hacer música implica algo más que la voz o los dedos tocando un instrumento; Un niño que aprende acerca de la música tiene que aprovechar múltiples conjuntos de habilidades, a menudo simultáneamente.
La fabricación de música puede ser una experiencia de aprendizaje social dinámica. Haciendo música juntos, los niños aprenden a trabajar en equipo, mientras que contribuyen a la canción a su manera. Al mismo tiempo, la música ayuda a los niños a aprender que juntos pueden hacer algo más grande que la suma de sus partes.
Para los niños, la música ofrece muchos, muchos beneficios. Los expertos están de acuerdo, hay muchas cosas buenas acerca de dejar que su hijo aprenda a tocar un instrumento.
- Aumentará su poder cerebral
-Los ayuda socialmente
-Es un constructor de confianza
-Enseña paciencia
- Enseña disciplina
- Es una gran forma de expresión
- Creativamente la música es buena para el cuerpo, alma y espíritu.

<h3>Viva Lion California Tour 2016</h3>
<p>Viva Lion is my name on stage, born Daniele Cardinale. I am italian musician grown in the local rock  scene. I moved to Toronto, Canada in 2009 and stepped into the folk scene. I wrote my first acoustic songs in Canada. Back to Italy I signed to Cosecomuni, an independent label focused on indie rock and quality recordings. Debut album “The Green Dot Ep” was released in January 25th 2013 followed by an Italian tour and shows in Spain and California.</p>
<p>Viva Lion signed to the italian label INRI in 2015 and the new album Mi Casa Es Tu Casa was released on October 23rd 2015.</p>
<p>According to the press, the sound recalls what made the american signature sound, a blend of gospel, folk, country, and rock. The first record on INRI has an impressively mature songwriting, to the point where it’s hard to locate where it comes from or when it was written and recorded. A wide variety of genres that makes it unique and coherent all the same, through lyrics and sounds that go from the traditional gospel to early folk, yet the listener is able to capture the influence of contemporary music that gave life to recent new folk.</p>
<p>I chose the title “Mi Casa Es Tu Casa” for two reasons. First off, the mexicans in California. I spent a significant time of my life in Southern California and i learned a lot from their welcoming and warming attitude. Second reason, the number of shows i’ve been playing since The Green Dot Ep was released: almost 200 shows throughout Italy, Spain e the States, either in live clubs, bars, stores and houses, and feeling at home is what i like the most when i am on stage. Mi Casa Es Tu Casa is a welcoming message that goes both ways: it is from us to the audience and from the audience (and the venue and the managers and the promoters) to us.</p>
<p> I opened as Viva Lion for Stereophonics, Moving Mountains, Turin Brakes, Xavier Rudd. I played at The Viper Room in Hollywood, Cafè Berlin in Madrid and Auditorium Parco della Musica in Rome.</p>
<p>I get the chance to come back to California to play a week of shows in support of the new album ""Mi Casa Es tu Casa"" in September. It is going to be solo shows, me and my acoustic guitar.</p>

I’ve had many Christmas songs whirling through
my head for several years.  Now it’s time
to make them audible!  

I’m working on a CD of Christmas songs along with some of my friends to include piano and other instruments.  But it’s expensive to make a recording, especially if only a few friends buy one.   It will take at least $5000 to record, pay three or four musicians, studio time, art work and manufacturing.  So I’m asking for your help to get this project off the ground.

About Ted . . .
I've had the privilege of playing piano, coaching international music teams, arranging and recording in several countries around the world.  I started tinkering on the piano when my nose was only as high as the keyboard, took years of piano lessons, studied music at the University of Toronto and the University of Minnesota, and led choirs, orchestras and worship teams in several churches.
Expressing the love of God through music - and especially on the piano - has been the joy of my life.   I just love the sounds of Christmas!  Some of the songs are fun, some restful, some are joyful Carols, and all of them will help stoke the fires of the 'Christmas Spirit'. Other Ways You Can Help

After speaking with her for several days, I realized that I'd developed a fondness for her.

It's a way for me to do something exceptional for someone who I believe is exceptional. :)<br/><br/>I have no expectations.

This is not just a collection of musical pieces, this is a proud expedition to the borders of the ocean. We will bring you there, opening our heart to the unknown sailing away taking with us just piano, trombone, drums and voice.What We Need & What You GetI would have needed much more money than this. I will produce this record all by myself. Money will be used for: paying the recording studio, the hotelrooms and meals for the musicians, the travel expenses and the mixing for the record. 1500 euro is the amount I am missing, it is not the complete cost of this record.I am choosing Flexible founding: it means if I wouldn't reach the entire goal I am going to use the received money in the way I explained previously.The ImpactThis project deserves your support because it celebrates beauty and poetry against shallowness and violence. It glorifies people that stand on their feet and open up heart to the universe. It is an anthem to freedom.With me you'll hear the voices sound of some of the best musicians we have in Italy, with an impressive international guest and a nine years old girl who sings just like an angel. I am not willing to use their names to raise money, If you know me just a bit, you are going to trust me.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you cannot contribute, please mention this page to a friend!

<div>That pretty well sums up what this album is about.<p>We love playing music with a deep and powerful inspirational message AND we love a myriad of styles and genres of popular playing music like: blues, jazz, country, rock, and alternative - and consequently this album has it all! </p>
<p>As artists we believe in creating a transformative experience for the audience.  Thats what this is all about.  Transforming the moment. There is really something for everyone in this CD.  We definitely have a variety of styles here.  Meditative songs like ""In The Now"", ""Om"",  ""Namaste"" or ""In the Magic Of The Moment"" are the kind of pieces that open the heart.  Even in the studio we found ourselves swaying with the meditative feel of the music.  The soulful ballads like ""You Lift Me Up"" or ""Heaven Knows""  are really love song to the divine.  And then there are the great bluesy numbers like ""Let Go"" where Sandra gets to 'go Janice' on the vocals or The super fast paced rockin number - ""It's Time""  - that lets us all see just how fast Rex can play that piano!   ""Happy For No Reason"" - ""A Peace Of Our Own"" - these songs are all fun and playful.  And Magic Happens sounds like it needs a full on Broadway musical written to go with it.  </p>

<p></p><p>We have been playing and writing together for about 15 years.

<p></p>
<div>
<p><b><i>On the evening of June 13 at Temple of the Arts at the SABAN theater, the Consul Generals of Germany, Holland and Israel, along with SAG/AFTRA (the Screen Actor’s Guild)  will pay homage to this real life hero.</i></b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/581318/files/20140515061511-BESTEMMING-ADIMAGE01.jpg?1400159711"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<b>However, our work will not be completed on June 13th. We will continue to thrive to make a change through music, and this is why we open the campaign to those who are able and would like to donate beyond our immediate goal and support our future goals.  </b><p></p>
<p><b>The inspiration:</b>  On the night of Kristallnacht, Curt Lowens and his family fled Germany to Holland.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Barely 14 years old, Curt joined the Dutch Resistance. One day, Curt followed the trajectory of two U.S. Pilots who had bailed out of their wounded aircraft. Before they could be apprehended by the Nazis, Curt got to them first and hid them in a haystack. He saved their lives. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">By this act of courage, Curt inspired us, and showed us that we all as individuals have the power to fight oppression. </span></p>
<p>Over 70 years later, we watched as the children and grandchildren of one of the pilots were united with Curt during Yom Kippur services at Temple of the Arts in Beverly Hills.    Coincidentally, Just around that time, Sharon was commissioned by acclaimed Cellist Ruslan Biryukov (who's also known as <i>The Jimi Hendrix of the Cello!!!</i>) and the Glendale Philharmonic Orchestra to compose a new cello concerto.  Inspired, she contacted Curt Lowens , who  gave her his blessing to create a new musical piece.</p>
<p>And so she did.  <b>BESTEMMING</b> (which means ‘Destination’ in Dutch, taken from Curt’s book, <b>Destination: Question Mark</b>) is written for Cello, Orchestra and Narrator, and  is the first concerto of its kind to be written for this combination.</p>
<p><b><i>The narration, although in Curt’s ‘voice’, is generic to the power of the individual to change their world and  is weaved into the music as it has a dialogue with the cello and orchestra. </i></b></p>
<p></p>
<div>The Concerto was world premiered on January 5th, 2014 to a sold out audience and received a standing ovation. The event was covered by broadcast news and print media. It was a moving experience for those who attended. A father, who was comforted by his 5 years old twin boys, sobbed openly.  <p></p>
<p><b><i>There was a connection made with those who heard it that was inspirational.</i></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Our mission is to convey <b>Inspiration, Remembrance, Tolerance, Understanding and Education</b> for this and future generations, all over the world. <b><i>We recognize that the concerto and Curt’s story speaks not only to Jews, but to other cultural factions and individuals who are facing ethnic cleansing, suppression and oppression.</i></b></p>
<p>Your contribution will go towards staging a reprise performance of the concerto at the historic Saban Theatre in Beverly Hills, on the night of <span>June 13, 2014</span>.   Curt Lowens himself will assume the role of the narrator, and at 89 years of age,  will give the performance of his career.</p>
<p><b>This a free event open to all. We would love to see you, meet you and introduce you to the power of music!</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p></p>In order to subsidize this historic performance, we need your donations rather quickly.  The total cost to put on the Concerto will be around $60,000.  The funds will be used to pay the following participants:<p></p>

</div></div>","Every day we read about hostile acts of oppression that seem to be surging against Jews and other ethnic / religious / racial groups. Through the arts we are making a difference, and now you can too.  We have witnessed the power that music has in shaping opinions and removing hate.  We did it once, and with you and our partner Los Angeles Museum of The Holocaust (LAMOTH) we will do it again.THIS JUST IN!Read about our event in the Hollywood Reporter!We need your help to stage a Cello Concerto by composer Sharon Farber, inspired by the amazing story of a remarkable man, Curt Lowens - a survivor of the Holocaust who saved over a hundred lives.


On the evening of June 13 at Temple of the Arts at the SABAN theater, the Consul Generals of Germany, Holland and Israel, along with SAG/AFTRA (the Screen Actor’s Guild)  will pay homage to this real life hero.



However, our work will not be completed on June 13th. We will continue to thrive to make a change through music, and this is why we open the campaign to those who are able and would like to donate beyond our immediate goal and support our future goals.  
The inspiration:  On the night of Kristallnacht, Curt Lowens and his family fled Germany to Holland.

Barely 14 years old, Curt joined the Dutch Resistance. One day, Curt followed the trajectory of two U.S. Pilots who had bailed out of their wounded aircraft. Before they could be apprehended by the Nazis, Curt got to them first and hid them in a haystack. He saved their lives. By this act of courage, Curt inspired us, and showed us that we all as individuals have the power to fight oppression. 
Over 70 years later, we watched as the children and grandchildren of one of the pilots were united with Curt during Yom Kippur services at Temple of the Arts in Beverly Hills.    Coincidentally, Just around that time, Sharon was commissioned by acclaimed Cellist Ruslan Biryukov (who's also known as The Jimi Hendrix of the Cello!!!) and the Glendale Philharmonic Orchestra to compose a new cello concerto.  Inspired, she contacted Curt Lowens , who  gave her his blessing to create a new musical piece.
And so she did.  BESTEMMING (which means ‘Destination’ in Dutch, taken from Curt’s book, Destination: Question Mark) is written for Cello, Orchestra and Narrator, and  is the first concerto of its kind to be written for this combination.
The narration, although in Curt’s ‘voice’, is generic to the power of the individual to change their world and  is weaved into the music as it has a dialogue with the cello and orchestra. 

The Concerto was world premiered on January 5th, 2014 to a sold out audience and received a standing ovation. The event was covered by broadcast news and print media. It was a moving experience for those who attended. A father, who was comforted by his 5 years old twin boys, sobbed openly.  
There was a connection made with those who heard it that was inspirational.

Our mission is to convey Inspiration, Remembrance, Tolerance, Understanding and Education for this and future generations, all over the world. We recognize that the concerto and Curt’s story speaks not only to Jews, but to other cultural factions and individuals who are facing ethnic cleansing, suppression and oppression.
Your contribution will go towards staging a reprise performance of the concerto at the historic Saban Theatre in Beverly Hills, on the night of June 13, 2014.   Curt Lowens himself will assume the role of the narrator, and at 89 years of age,  will give the performance of his career.
This a free event open to all. We would love to see you, meet you and introduce you to the power of music!




What We Need & What You Get
In order to subsidize this historic performance, we need your donations rather quickly.  The total cost to put on the Concerto will be around $60,000.  The funds will be used to pay the following participants:


The Glendale Philharmonic Orchestra
Services of a pro sound engineer
Professional Audio and Video recording
The making of a mini documentary 
Rental/delivery of a second piano (the concerto has two piano parts)
Stage crew/manager
Musicians catering (they all need to eat between rehearsals and performance so they have energy to play!)
Production and printing of the Bestemming Commemorative Program Book that will include your name and/or advertisement (see perks below)

Security

The T-shirt
As last year, we will collaborate with Limited Addiction to manufacture the 2010 LDBK tees. Expect hangtags, sleevetags, buttons and the unbeatable Limited Addiction quality. Here is a rough sketch of Oli-B's design. Make sure to pre-order yours (we'll contact you to ask for your size/model on the 16th of May) because we know from experience that we will not be able to meet all demands and will print only 150 tees.
 
 


The network
LDBK's priority is to connect communities around the world and activate them to engage in different projects. Most of our content is generated through this unique and ever-growing international network of creative minds (designers, photographers, writers, artists, musicians, DJ's, software developers, filmmakers and so forth).
 
Once again, we want to have the whole team on board for this project: while musicians and producers are locked in their studio, one of our favorite painters - Oli-B - is working on the album/t-shirt artwork, others will be documenting the whole process, we'll have DJ's collaborating on several facets of the release etc.
 
But YOU - listener, supporter, follower or collaborator - are also part of this LDBK network. The success of this IndieGoGo campaign will determine the reach of the project. In other words, the more funds we can gather, the more CD's we can press, the more promotion we can make, etc.
 
Invest in this project and make it yours
The total cost of this project - $7500 - will be entirely financed through this crowd-funding campaign. With this sum, we will press 1000 CD's, promote all the artists/partners involved and organize the release party.
 
In order to make this happen, we need your help! We made different packages you can choose from, including downloads, CD's, T-Shirts, Stickers, ....
 
Follow every step we make
Jump on board, we will take you on a journey! Our various online profiles will serve as relay to document every stages of the project so that you can follow us and interact through the whole process. We'll give you real time updates and behind the scene teasers on Laid Back's Facebook, Twitter and website. Make sure you check these on a regular basis AND spread the word around!

<h3>WHO AM I AND WHAT IS THE EP ABOUT?</h3>
<p>My name is Charles G. D. Harding and I am a 20 year-old musician from Fredericton, NB, Canada. I have finished the recording of my first ever EP and have set a release date. The EP is titled ""We Don't Know The World That We Left Behind"". The EP will be sold digitally, but my biggest dream is to produce hard copies of this CD. I have the means to do it, but I don't have the money to produce as many as I would need. </p>
<p>The EP was inspired by a series daydreams of alien lights appearing above Fredericton, NB. The album is based upon the concept of having appreciation for the things that we have.</p>
<p>I have ideas and feelings that I want to spread to the world through my music. Any support would be extremely appreciated! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>WHAT THE MONEY WILL BE USED FOR:</h3>
<p>The money that is raised for this project will go towards the following:</p>
<p>-Production of CD's and hard copies (album covers, cd labels, ink cartridges for printer)</p>
<p>-Various forms of merchandise (posters, t-shirts, stickers, etc.)</p>
<p>-Promotion of the CD-Shipping of the CD.</p>
<p>-Equipment for live preformances </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>THE PURPOSE:</h3>
<p>I find that with creating a piece of art or music it doesn't feel right if there is not a purpose attached to it. My purpose with this EP is to transmit the idea that we, as humans, should look at what we have in this world and appreciate it. But, as well as appreciating what we have, we should use those things (even the little things) to their fullest potential. It is important to give justice to the gifts that we have recieved in our lives. I think that in doing this we will find true happiness.</p>
<p>Spreading my hopes and ideas for the world is one of my biggest dreams and any support from anyone would be the greatest help to me in fulfilling those dreams. Thank you so much to anyone who is willing to support me in this project!</p>

will be our biggest statement."" –AP
We really appreciate you reading this far but please
continue reading for a very important message. We have everything in line to
record an excellent record, but unfortunately, we lack a portion of the
funding. For most of you, you've been to numerous shows, told your friends
about us and maybe invested something personal into this Tepetricy journey. We
do know who you are and appreciate you very much. And since we know you, you're
probably asking, ""we get it dude, what are ya selling?"" Okay...we
need to raise $5,000 to continue recording our album. $5,000 bucks and we'll
take care of the rest. To show you what this campaign is all about, we've
released our new single and music video for ""Hole Digger"" and have listed
many other notable perks for your donations. So please take your time and choose
the package that best fits you AND please spread the word by telling people to
check out our new music video that we’re so excited about! Your support is and
always will be paramount to our success. We thank you!Any questions about Tepetricy's New Album 2014? Discuss on our thread at: Tepetricy New Album 2014 on CrowdFundingForum.comwww.tepetricy.com | www.facebook.com/tepetricy | www.twitter.com/tepetricy",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

My early years were filled with involvement in musical theatre, choral groups, and stage vocal performance, in combination with intensive dance and stage training. As I have stepped into adulthood, my passion for music and dance has continued, and has been brought to a deeper level through my spiritual awakening. <b>I have gained an understanding of the power of sound frequency and how it can be used as a healing and awakening force for personal transformation. </b></p><p><b>I have also gained inspiration and direction of my music through the influence of electronic music culture.</b>For years, I have been performing at West Coast and International music festivals, as well as using my gifts through my involvement in sound healing ceremonies, local performance, and collaborations.<b> My most recent and current collaborations are with Shaman's Dream, and Desert Dwellers, a talented team of ethnic downtempo bass music producers. I have had the honor to create an EP with Desert Dwellers (Dive Into Forever), serving as the main vocalist and combining my vocals and lyrics with their original music.</b></p><p><a href=""http://desertdwellersmusic.bandcamp.com/album/dive-into-forever-ep"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://desertdwellersmusic.bandcamp.com/album/dive-into-forever-ep</a></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/586291/files/20140517153835-1184760_467745616664771_663864409_n.jpg?1400366315"" src="""" style=""width: 422.75103163686384px; height: 635px;""/></b></p><b><br/></b><p></p><p><b> Now I am ready to create a project that is my own!</b> </p>
<p>Many of my friends and people who have heard me sing have been encouraging me to make an album and adamantly requesting recorded music they can take with them, and I am now ready to make that happen and get my music out there! </p><p><b>My dream and vision is to produce a full length electronic/acoustic album containing all original music and content. It will be a fresh fusion of electronic world bass, multicultural medicine music, original vocals, and soaring ethereal soundscapes. </b>Something you can get down to on the dance floor or play during a long drive or relaxing at home. Complex rhythms, driving bass, and  strong beats will enhance and support my feminine vocals. <b>Im picturing the perfect blend of electronic and organic sounds, bringing together the best of both worlds.</b></p>
<p> <b>To enhance healing power, the entire album will be produced in the earth frequency: 432hz, and will be laced with binaural beats and theta waves </b>(see below for details). This album will be a clear reflection of all aspects of the human experience, of this complex and beautiful life. It will serve as tool for an uplifting, transformational and healing journey. </p><p>I hope to make this music available to the masses, through audio avenues as well as multimedia live performance, including dance, art, and acting. My performances (or prayerformaces) will be vivid, full sensory journeys, intended to facilitate transformation through deep trance-state dance and sound healing. I see this album as gift to the world, and a way to bring potent medicine, inspiration, and light to the masses! I recognize it as my calling to share my gift as a channel of sound with the planet, <b>but I know I cannot do this alone.

THANK YOU SO MUCH! KEEP AN EYE AND EAR OUT FOR ""FULL SPECTRUM MEDICINE"" Coming soon!!....xoxox ~PRRISMA~ xoxoxhttps://facebook.com/prrismahttps://soundcloud.com/prrismahttp://www.youtube.com/user/prrismamusichttps://prrisma.bandcamp.comhttp://desertdwellersmusic.bandcamp.com/album/dive-into-forever-epSome Comedy For your viewing pleasurrrrreee!My Story...I am Prrisma, a singer/songwriter, or as I prefer to say, A Shamanic Songstress…This name Prrisma embodies the playful purring energy of the cat within me, combined with the prismatic rainbow of sounds and feelings I bring through my voice. My music is a full spectrum blend of styles, which weaves uplifting poetry into a combination of electronic soundscapes, including influences of multicultural medicine music, R&B soul flavors, and soaring etheric sound healing.  I have been singing for as long as I can remember, and it has always been my dream to share my voice with the world on a large scale. My early years were filled with involvement in musical theatre, choral groups, and stage vocal performance, in combination with intensive dance and stage training. As I have stepped into adulthood, my passion for music and dance has continued, and has been brought to a deeper level through my spiritual awakening. I have gained an understanding of the power of sound frequency and how it can be used as a healing and awakening force for personal transformation. I have also gained inspiration and direction of my music through the influence of electronic music culture.For years, I have been performing at West Coast and International music festivals, as well as using my gifts through my involvement in sound healing ceremonies, local performance, and collaborations. My most recent and current collaborations are with Shaman's Dream, and Desert Dwellers, a talented team of ethnic downtempo bass music producers. I have had the honor to create an EP with Desert Dwellers (Dive Into Forever), serving as the main vocalist and combining my vocals and lyrics with their original music.http://desertdwellersmusic.bandcamp.com/album/dive-into-forever-ep Now I am ready to create a project that is my own! 
Many of my friends and people who have heard me sing have been encouraging me to make an album and adamantly requesting recorded music they can take with them, and I am now ready to make that happen and get my music out there! My dream and vision is to produce a full length electronic/acoustic album containing all original music and content. It will be a fresh fusion of electronic world bass, multicultural medicine music, original vocals, and soaring ethereal soundscapes. Something you can get down to on the dance floor or play during a long drive or relaxing at home. Complex rhythms, driving bass, and  strong beats will enhance and support my feminine vocals. Im picturing the perfect blend of electronic and organic sounds, bringing together the best of both worlds.
 To enhance healing power, the entire album will be produced in the earth frequency: 432hz, and will be laced with binaural beats and theta waves (see below for details). This album will be a clear reflection of all aspects of the human experience, of this complex and beautiful life. It will serve as tool for an uplifting, transformational and healing journey. I hope to make this music available to the masses, through audio avenues as well as multimedia live performance, including dance, art, and acting. My performances (or prayerformaces) will be vivid, full sensory journeys, intended to facilitate transformation through deep trance-state dance and sound healing. I see this album as gift to the world, and a way to bring potent medicine, inspiration, and light to the masses! I recognize it as my calling to share my gift as a channel of sound with the planet, but I know I cannot do this alone. I need your support to make this mission of service and this personal dream a reality! This is where YOU come in...
Before I decided to make one of my own, I never realized just how much goes into making an album. It requires a complex combination of people, skills, resources, time, energy, and, of course, MONEY! A lot more money than one would guess. To get quality, many components must be taken into account, such as skilled producers and musicians, quality studio gear, studio time, proper mixing, and physical cd production. I feel that you all deserve the highest quality album I can possibly make, and want to offer nothing less than my best. Sure, I could just record these songs on GarageBand and throw some beats under it, but I understand the importance of a finely crafted and intricate piece of music, and what it can do for one's soul. I want to offer you music that will move you, inspire you, and touch you deeply. I want to invest the time, energy, and love into an offering that can make an impact, and serve as a light in the darkness, a fine jewel in among thousands of grains of sand. MY TEAM:To really encompass the Full Spectrum Medicine of this album, I will be bringing together a team of some of the top producers in the industry, to co-create a rich and diverse pallet of sound design and music. My Team Includes:Temple Step Project http://templestepproject.comDesert Dwellers  http://desertdwellers.orgBirds of Paradise  http://birdsofparadisemusic.bandcamp.comJoshua Pennman of Akara http://www.akaraproject.comJediRising Soundcloud.com/JediRisingSIXIS   soundcloud.com/sixis-3Living Light http://soundcloud.com/livinglightMystral soundcloud.com/mystralmusicU.F.AUM HANNAH http://soundcloud.com/hannahthiemJemInEye Incantations https://soundcloud.com/jemineyeincantationsOver the years, my music has been so inspired by intentional electronic music and the community that surrounds it. It feels really powerful to now birth a creation from that inspiration, bringing together the best qualities of the tribe's intentional producers and musicians to serve an album that reflects the full spectrum colors of this culture. 
And so I humbly ask for your support in helping me bring this deep and magical offering to you and the world! If my art, vision and intention inspires or interests you in any way, I encourage you to get involved, and become an active part of this creation! Your donations make a HUGE impact on the success and quality of this project. And every little bit helps. What I Need and Where it is Going:My intention is to produce a Full Length 14 track album. I also will be launching my music career with the creation of a website, album art and production, and live performance set up. Here is how the budget breaks down:Electronic Music Production: $500 per track: $7,000Instrumental Musicians: $100 per track: $1,400Studio Fees, Vocal Recording and Editing: $4,000Mastering: $1,000Mixing: $4,000Physical CD Production: $1,000Website and associated graphic design: $1,000Album and Promotional Artwork: $750Photo shoots: $750Live Performance Gear: $1,000Travel Costs to Record: $1,600IndieGoGo Percentage: $1,000 (@ 4%)TOTAL: $25,000

<p><em>The Flint Hill Fellowship</em> is an ever expanding group of musician friends that share a passion for the gospel and expressing it through musical worship and praise. The two founding members, <a href=""http://rickykendall.bandcamp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_parent"">Ricky Kendall</a> and John Dunne, have been playing music together for the better part of the last decade. </p>
<p><em>Songs of Praise and Thanks Volume 1 </em> is a collaborative worship project between two small church communities and the Flint Hill Fellowship. All of the songs are original, including adaptations of scripture and were written within those church communities. </p>
<p><strong>Why Make a Worship Album?</strong></p>
<p>It is good to praise God. (Psalm 92: 1-3, Psalm 33:3). That is the beautiful simplicity of it.  No grandiose ambition lurks behind this recording; it is a simple act of praise. Some may not think this possible in the medium of music recording. In fact it may typically seem the opposite when a person toils to make some object that glorifies an artistic statement rather than God almighty.</p>
<p>But the Scriptures say that in all things, in word or deed, do in the name of Christ (Col 3:17). From our perspective, we sought to prolong our praise to God through the meticulous crafting of these seven songs. We sought to bring a community of musicians together, both believer and non-believer—showing love to one another as we honor the living God.  We sought to make good music as an offering, not a statement.  By His grace, He has guided us through these last 12 months in such a way that I feel confident in saying this recording belongs to Him and to those who seek Him.</p>
<p><strong>Why do you need money? </strong></p>
<p>We were the first to ask this question. Ultimatly, we felt it was important to share the experiences we have had with other people. Scriptures say that our worship should be an expresion of love to God and to one another (John 21: 15-17). These songs were written for the express purpose of worship in the gathered church, and they have blessed the people in our local church communites for the last 5 years. It is our hope that others will find joy in these songs as well. </p>
<p>The reality of doing this involves realworld costs. Throughout this project, God provided money through many generous hearts. As of now, we need the last bit to produce 1000 physical copies. These will go to people like you, to leaders in local churches, and to those that may know nothing of Christ's redeeming love.   </p>
<p><strong>Specifics</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The release date is June 5th.  </li>
<li>The money will go towards packaging, printing, replication, and distribution</li>
<li>These songs will be published to some degree, regardless of whether funding is met. The manner in which they are published, however, completely rests on this funding.</li>
<li>Take careful note of some of the incentives. I am a graphic designer and printmaker–and I would love to give those who back this project limited edition album packages, posters, and even a full-service branding strategy/design for a business or blog etc. I will periodically post photos of artwork during the course of this campaign.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>God has already greatly shown His grace to us throughout this recording process, and we are excited to share these songs with you. If you are so inclined, please pray for this project, that His will is done, whether great or small. Thanks for your consideration in giving to this project and God bless you. </p></div>","Introductions

Without it we are not whole.  As a creative individual having spent years as a flash programmer, switching to audio wasn't that far off of the learning curve.   The science of sound and mix engineering is where It all started to get really deep.  Now a full time mix engineer and experienced production artist, he is ready to take on the responsibility of releasing some of the most unique Electro, Glitch Hop, Dubstep, Drumstep, DnB, Neurofunk, Midtempo Funk, and Midtempo Chillstep possible.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>A message from the man himself:  </b></p>
<p>""My goal is more than just putting out an album.  I want to help change the current music industry through example.  We have a lot of artists flooding the charts with sample based music (purchased waveform sections used to build tracks cookie-cutter style) with little to no sound design experience.  I want to be another one of the guys showing upcomers how to accomplish their goals with hard work and proper motivation.""</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Why I need your help:<br/></b><br/>Funding a project of this magnitude is difficult for any 'starving artist'.  We often encounter financial roadblocks at every turn. A few experienced artists have told me ""spending as much time as possible in the studio is the key to banging out a killer record"".

</div></span></span></span></div>","Ascendism is just one of the 2 members of the duo sensation known as PhotoniX.  Focusing on melodic composition and sound design in all styles of electronic music, he has risen to earn respect from a ton of current electronic artists, mix engineers, as well as promoters and event organizers all over the world.

http://soundcloud.com/photonix_officialPhotoniX is an ongoing collaborative effort, and will not be affected by the solo projects of either Woogie or Ascendism.  We may end up having a Woogie remix on the debut EP however ;-)

A preview of the EP!  (that's right! I've already started it!)

https://soundcloud.com/ascendism/the-absence-of-moonlight-a

Ascendism:

Starting out as a basement producer at the age of 25, he spent 2 full years dedicated to learning sound design, mix engineering, and electronic music production techniques.  This time was allotted to do NOTHING BUT Music!  Why?  Because music is our escape, our magic. Without it we are not whole.  As a creative individual having spent years as a flash programmer, switching to audio wasn't that far off of the learning curve.   The science of sound and mix engineering is where It all started to get really deep.  Now a full time mix engineer and experienced production artist, he is ready to take on the responsibility of releasing some of the most unique Electro, Glitch Hop, Dubstep, Drumstep, DnB, Neurofunk, Midtempo Funk, and Midtempo Chillstep possible.

A message from the man himself:  
""My goal is more than just putting out an album.  I want to help change the current music industry through example.  We have a lot of artists flooding the charts with sample based music (purchased waveform sections used to build tracks cookie-cutter style) with little to no sound design experience.  I want to be another one of the guys showing upcomers how to accomplish their goals with hard work and proper motivation.""

Why I need your help:Funding a project of this magnitude is difficult for any 'starving artist'.  We often encounter financial roadblocks at every turn. A few experienced artists have told me ""spending as much time as possible in the studio is the key to banging out a killer record"". While we all know time isn't free (or cheap even)..  It's safe to say that things like a proper advertising campaign, graphics for the album art, logos and custom graphics for clothing/stickers/flyers are usually overlooked at a glance.
I would love to have your support in any fashion you can provide it!  I love every single one of you simply for taking the time to read this, that alone shows a huge point of character for all of you.  <3  and THANK YOU for your contribution and page shares!! Pass on the love to your friends who may be interested!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>In the past 15 years, music programs have been in the process of being cut all over the United States due to budgetary constraints. But, by cutting music programs out from the curriculum, schools and communities are actually hurting their children.</p>
<p>It has been proven on more then one occassion that music helps increase test scores, verbal skills, language skills (both speech and comprehension), math skills and temporal spacial understanding. But, because of the cost involved in providing instruments, sheet music, and instructors-schools are just throwing this valuable asset away. </p>
<p>As a result myself, Monika Ratzenboeck and my two sons, Marcus and Derek and daughter Karissa have created this foundation to help provide music back to schools and children all over the United States.  As part of our foundation we take damaged musical instruments and fix them then provide them to the students of participating schools. All schools are eligible to participate, all they need to do is fill out an application, have space for a music class and have students who are or want to be enrolled in a music program at their schools. We then fix these instruments and ship them to the participating schools and students. In addition, we provide a scholarship program for students who want to persue a career in music. There is an application process and all scholarship monies are presented at the end of the school term for the winning student(s).</p>
<p>The reason that All Children's Music Foundation is looking for funding is that we have over 300 instruments that we need to get fixed and shipped to aspiring musicians and blossoming music programs all over the nation. To fix these instruments, it takes money and time. We have been running this program for over 14 years without outside funding, but now we need your help to continue this great program for students. </p>

<p>Music has been a very important part of my families lives. I have two sons who are both recording artists in very different genres of music. Both of my sons are classically trained and both are highly educated as musicians. Marcus was even a professor of music in Louisville when he was performing with the Louisville Orchestra. Now Marcus, is a famous hard rock recording artist with the Warner Group Artists platinum selling band Tantric and still performing with the Sarasota and Florida Orchestras and along with his brother started a recording studio called H&amp;M Productions, with offices in Sarasota Florida, and New York City.</p>

<h3>T<span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">he Impact</span>
</h3>
<p>In 2007 a study by Christopher Johnson, professor of music education and music therapy at the University of Kansas, revealed that students in elementary schools with superior music education programs scored around 22 percent higher in English and 20 percent higher in math scores on standardized tests, compared to schools with low-quality music programs, regardless of socioeconomic disparities among the schools or school districts. Johnson compares the concentration that music training requires to the focus needed to perform well on a standardized test.</p>
<p>Aside from test score results, Johnson’s study highlights the positive effects that a quality music education can have on a young child’s success. Luehrisen explains this psychological phenomenon in two sentences: “Schools that have rigorous programs and high-quality music and arts teachers probably have high-quality teachers in other areas. If you have an environment where there are a lot of people doing creative, smart, great things, joyful things, even people who aren’t doing that have a tendency to go up and do better.”</p>
<p>We at All Children's Music Foundation have been successfully running this program for over 14 years. We made a decision this year that over the next 5 years we would like to increase our number of scholarships to 20 children and our number of schools to 50. Help us give music back to our children. The impact it will have on our future is irreplaceable.</p>
</div>
<div>

<p><em><strong>SO DONATE TODAY AND GET THE WORD OUT ABOUT ALL CHILDREN'S MUSIC FOUNDATION. </strong></em></p></div>","Short Summary
In the past 15 years, music programs have been in the process of being cut all over the United States due to budgetary constraints. But, by cutting music programs out from the curriculum, schools and communities are actually hurting their children.
It has been proven on more then one occassion that music helps increase test scores, verbal skills, language skills (both speech and comprehension), math skills and temporal spacial understanding. But, because of the cost involved in providing instruments, sheet music, and instructors-schools are just throwing this valuable asset away. 
As a result myself, Monika Ratzenboeck and my two sons, Marcus and Derek and daughter Karissa have created this foundation to help provide music back to schools and children all over the United States.  As part of our foundation we take damaged musical instruments and fix them then provide them to the students of participating schools. All schools are eligible to participate, all they need to do is fill out an application, have space for a music class and have students who are or want to be enrolled in a music program at their schools. We then fix these instruments and ship them to the participating schools and students. In addition, we provide a scholarship program for students who want to persue a career in music. There is an application process and all scholarship monies are presented at the end of the school term for the winning student(s).
The reason that All Children's Music Foundation is looking for funding is that we have over 300 instruments that we need to get fixed and shipped to aspiring musicians and blossoming music programs all over the nation. To fix these instruments, it takes money and time. We have been running this program for over 14 years without outside funding, but now we need your help to continue this great program for students. 

A Little About The Founders of All Children's Music Foundation
Hello my name is Monika Ratzenboeck

Music has been a very important part of my families lives. I have two sons who are both recording artists in very different genres of music. Both of my sons are classically trained and both are highly educated as musicians. Marcus was even a professor of music in Louisville when he was performing with the Louisville Orchestra. Now Marcus, is a famous hard rock recording artist with the Warner Group Artists platinum selling band Tantric and still performing with the Sarasota and Florida Orchestras and along with his brother started a recording studio called H&M Productions, with offices in Sarasota Florida, and New York City.

While my other son Derek, also a recording artist, stuck with his classical upbringing and is performing with the New York Ballet in Lincoln Center. 

 
And my daughter Karissa has also taken a shine to music traveling internationally and performing live along side Derek and solo.

 
Music helped to shape the lives of my children and my family. Now please help us to help shape the lives of aspiring musicians and just the budding intellect of children across the United States. 
Let us give the same opportunity that was provided to my children, to other children around the United States. Help by providing funds to our Foundation, All Children's Music Foundation, a Sarasota Florida based 501 (c) 3.  Bring better opportunities, increased educational experience and possible help develop a passion for music and the arts within your community today.

The Impact

In 2007 a study by Christopher Johnson, professor of music education and music therapy at the University of Kansas, revealed that students in elementary schools with superior music education programs scored around 22 percent higher in English and 20 percent higher in math scores on standardized tests, compared to schools with low-quality music programs, regardless of socioeconomic disparities among the schools or school districts. Johnson compares the concentration that music training requires to the focus needed to perform well on a standardized test.
Aside from test score results, Johnson’s study highlights the positive effects that a quality music education can have on a young child’s success. Luehrisen explains this psychological phenomenon in two sentences: “Schools that have rigorous programs and high-quality music and arts teachers probably have high-quality teachers in other areas. If you have an environment where there are a lot of people doing creative, smart, great things, joyful things, even people who aren’t doing that have a tendency to go up and do better.”
We at All Children's Music Foundation have been successfully running this program for over 14 years. We made a decision this year that over the next 5 years we would like to increase our number of scholarships to 20 children and our number of schools to 50. Help us give music back to our children. The impact it will have on our future is irreplaceable.

<p>Let me begin by introducing myself, my name is Kimberly Roberts, President and CEO of Connection Records, LLC, an independent record label.  I started my indie label in 2008 right at the beginning of the economic recession.  For me that meant a loss of income from my 9-5 job because my employer was bought out and relocated to another state, a loss of investors for my new business, and no access to bank loans or grants.  They say when it rains it pours right?</p>
<p> I went ahead and released an album for my R&amp;B &amp; Soul artist Kashief (<a href=""http://www.kashief.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.kashief.com</a>) on September 7, 2010 hoping that miraculously it would sell without marketing and promoting the CD.  Boy was I kidding myself (SMH).</p>
<p>Thing is I’ve watched the CD sell some every month (avg. 127 singles annually) since the release without a marketing and promotions campaign, which made me realize even more that I have to market and promote the next project.  I am sure we’d sell 1000 times more if we can increase the fan base and get the music heard. I have a goal of selling 100K units in a year and selling 5K units the first week so we can enter the Billboard charts.</p>
<p>Kashief and I are currently working on a sophomore album, and this time I know I have to have a marketing and promotions campaign, so I have set my eyes on the SE region of the US as a starter. </p>
<p>I am looking to raise a minimum of $25,000.00 upwards to $50,000.00 to make this campaign possible.  Although that’s the goal….any funds raised will go towards the marketing and promotions campaign for Kashief, even if we fall short.  This is where you can help by making donations.  I’m on bended knees now :).</p>
<p>I will make sure you really understand how much your donation is appreciated by giving perks to participants in this drive.  Perks will include Lifetime VIP treatment by the label for donations, complimentary passes to shows/events, CD’s and T-Shirts, and mentions as sponsors on press releases, banners, and etc.  I have listed the resources we will use to market and promote in the SE region:  Music Video &amp; Promo Campaign, Playlist on Delta Airlines, Radio Advertising, Comcast, College Campus Tour, and Internet Media (ex. Straightfromthea).</p>
<p>One might ask the questions…why should I contribute or will my contribution make a difference?  My answers would be besides because you having a giving and charitable heart, you will be making a difference in the success story of a dreamer.  Also, yes it will make a difference because it will help me to properly market and promote as I live my dream. </p>
<p>You would be helping me build a fan base for an awesome artist <a href=""http://www.kashief.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.kashief.com</a> as well as build a brand.  There is nothing like the American dream. </p>
<p>As I said in the opening statement, it is tough out here!  And I will accept any donation you can make because plain and simple I need help.  But if you can’t make a monetary donation, I’d like to ask if you could do me a favor?  You are in the “Music” section so I can only assume you are a music lover, so spread the word about this campaign, Kashief, and Connection Records.  Use the Indiegogo share tools courtesy of Indiegogo.

<h2>SUFFOCATION, KITTIE, THE AGONIST, SKULL FIST, AUGURY, and BEHEADING OF A KING in Toronto!!!</h2>
<h3>Dates: September 7th and 8th, 2013</h3>
<h3>Venue: The Opera House</h3>
<h3>Event: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/142645535907013/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/events/142645535907013/</a>

<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Anyone who was at last year's festival in Halifax knows about Spread the Metal Records' committment to heaviness. But I believe businesses can be doing even more to assist the less fortunate. That's where the STM Festival comes in.</p>
<p>The idea behind it is to use whatever medium available to me, in this case heavy metal, to positively impact the most lives. Fans get a spectacular metal festival, and Kiva.org receives some much needed support!</p>
<p>They can explain it better here:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.heartandstroke.ca/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">www.kiva.org</a></p>
<p>Spread the Metal Records fights for those who cannot fight for themselves. We are transparent in all our business dealings and everyone gets straight answers from us. We have nothing to hide.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Putting on a metal festival is crazy expensive. Even more so if you want to bring in quality headliners, which we will obviously be doing!</p>
<p>Headliners:</p>
<p>SUFFOCATION</p>
<p>KITTIE</p>
<p>THE AGONIST</p>
<p>AUGURY</p>
<p>BEHEADING OF A KING</p>
<p>SKULL FIST</p>
<p>With Special Guests: THE CATALYST, SANKTUARY, DEATHPOINT, CRIMSON SHADOWS, ANSWER WITH METAL, HALLOWS DIE, NOTHING LEFT FOR TOMORROW, EVERTRAPPED, NEPHELIUM, DERELICT, and WRETCHED PAIN!!!</p>
<p>That's a pretty sick lineup, and all these bands need/deserve to be paid. But there's not only the band guarantees, there are also promotional costs, venue rentals, backline set-up, hospitality riders, and more.</p>
<p>We could cover all these costs with good ticket sales, but then hardly anything would be left over to donate to the cause. And after all, that's kind of the point here, eh?</p>
<p>We believe so strongly in what Kiva.org is doing, that we want to hand over more money than we EVER could by only relying on profits from ticket sales. Crowd funding has given us the opportunity to reach out to the internet community and make a real difference in people's lives.  </p>
<p>We're giving away SIGNED ALBUMS and SET LISTS from all the headliners, GUITAR PICKS, SIGNED TEE SHIRTS from the bands, FREE DIGITAL ALBUM DOWNLOADS, INVITATIONS TO THE SOUND CHECK, and so much more! You even get the chance to PUNCH A RECORD LABEL EXECUTIVE as hard as you'd like!!!</p>
<p>I'm going to be the one volunteering his body for that one! You get up on stage, and wale on me with boxing gloves in payback for what record labels have done!</p>
<p>NOTE ON SHIPPING: If you're planning on coming to the festival, we'll arrange to have your signed albums and such waiting for you. That saves us some shipping costs that would have otherwise come out of The Heart and Stroke Foundation's pockets. The less money we spend like that, the more goes towards the cause.</p>
<p>There is a full budget outlined below to show you exactly where your money is going!</p>
<h3>The Budget</h3>
<p>Spread the Metal Records believes in total transparency, in an industry where that is virtually non-existent. Fans deserve to know where their money is going and how it actually helps the people that we are claiming to help.</p>
<p>We are set up for flex funding, so even if we don't reach our goal, the money raised will still go towards costs. Any and all remaining profits from the festival will go to the non-profit organizations.</p>
<p>Total Estimated Costs:</p>
<p>Venue Rental Fees = $6,500</p>
<p>Publicity and Promotion = $1000</p>
<p>Hospitality Riders = $750</p>
<p>Event Insurance: $2,000</p>
<p>Extra Pit Security = $750</p>
<p>Band Guarantees = $19,950</p>
<p>Backline and Production = $2,500</p>
<p>GRAND TOTAL = $33,450</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<div>
<p>If you can't make it to the festival, or can't contribute to the campaign, no worries! Thank you for even reading down this far! That being said, there is so much you can do to help us get the message out and save lives. Tell others!!! With all the social networking and ways we can now connect with one another, by sharing this page, you are reaching places we would never be able to reach.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is what I, Matt Day, have dedicated my life to doing. Helping people to rise from the conditions in which they find themselves and create a better life for themselves and their families.</p>
<p>There are certain things that upset me. For example, just 1% of what the governments of the world spend on their militaries, is enough to put every child ON EARTH, into school.</p>
<p>There are something like 18 million empty houses in America, and only 5 million homeless people. Education and Health Care should be free but they're ridiculously expensive.</p>
<p>A staggering number of people are persecuted based on things like skin color, who they choose to marry, and other inconsequential shit.</p>
<p>Allow me to clear something up right now. It is the official position of myself and STM Records, that everyone has the right to be happy. If people spent more time looking for love, instead of judging the people who have already found it, I think we'd be a lot better off.</p>
<p>Another one of my favorite organizations is Doctors Without Borders. You can find out more about them here:</p>

We believe so strongly in what Kiva.org is doing, that we want to hand over more money than we EVER could by only relying on profits from ticket sales. Crowd funding has given us the opportunity to reach out to the internet community and make a real difference in people's lives.  
We're giving away SIGNED ALBUMS and SET LISTS from all the headliners, GUITAR PICKS, SIGNED TEE SHIRTS from the bands, FREE DIGITAL ALBUM DOWNLOADS, INVITATIONS TO THE SOUND CHECK, and so much more! You even get the chance to PUNCH A RECORD LABEL EXECUTIVE as hard as you'd like!!!
I'm going to be the one volunteering his body for that one! You get up on stage, and wale on me with boxing gloves in payback for what record labels have done!
NOTE ON SHIPPING: If you're planning on coming to the festival, we'll arrange to have your signed albums and such waiting for you. That saves us some shipping costs that would have otherwise come out of The Heart and Stroke Foundation's pockets. The less money we spend like that, the more goes towards the cause.
There is a full budget outlined below to show you exactly where your money is going!
The Budget
Spread the Metal Records believes in total transparency, in an industry where that is virtually non-existent. Fans deserve to know where their money is going and how it actually helps the people that we are claiming to help.
We are set up for flex funding, so even if we don't reach our goal, the money raised will still go towards costs. Any and all remaining profits from the festival will go to the non-profit organizations.
Total Estimated Costs:
Venue Rental Fees = $6,500
Publicity and Promotion = $1000
Hospitality Riders = $750
Event Insurance: $2,000
Extra Pit Security = $750
Band Guarantees = $19,950
Backline and Production = $2,500
GRAND TOTAL = $33,450
Other Ways You Can Help

If you can't make it to the festival, or can't contribute to the campaign, no worries! Thank you for even reading down this far! That being said, there is so much you can do to help us get the message out and save lives. Tell others!!! With all the social networking and ways we can now connect with one another, by sharing this page, you are reaching places we would never be able to reach.
The Impact
This is what I, Matt Day, have dedicated my life to doing. Helping people to rise from the conditions in which they find themselves and create a better life for themselves and their families.
There are certain things that upset me. For example, just 1% of what the governments of the world spend on their militaries, is enough to put every child ON EARTH, into school.
There are something like 18 million empty houses in America, and only 5 million homeless people. Education and Health Care should be free but they're ridiculously expensive.
A staggering number of people are persecuted based on things like skin color, who they choose to marry, and other inconsequential shit.
Allow me to clear something up right now. It is the official position of myself and STM Records, that everyone has the right to be happy. If people spent more time looking for love, instead of judging the people who have already found it, I think we'd be a lot better off.
Another one of my favorite organizations is Doctors Without Borders. You can find out more about them here:

FOR INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING, PLEASE ADD $3 FOR CANADA, $5 FOR THE UNITED STATES, AND $8 FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD

<p><b>Monmouth University Music Industry Students are at it again</b></p>
<p>West Long Branch, New Jersey,
October 2013: Have you heard about Blue Hawk Records? It began as part the
Applied Music Industry II course of spring semester 2013.  An idea was born for a student-run record
label under the instruction and supervision of Professor Joe Rapolla, Monmouth University Alum and music industry veteran. </p>
<p>Forming Blue Hawk Records gives
students the experience of the real world within the classrooms at Monmouth
University. It gives the opportunity to see what each position of a record
label entails and the members were able to find their true talents.  A lot was accomplished in the total of twelve
hours spent in class. Four artists submitted music and were chosen to be featured
in the Spring 2013 Compilation CD. There are two bands, 99 Regrets and Seasons,
and two singer-songwriters, Sarah Gublin and Natalie Zeller. They were able to
record, master, and package the compilation CD, create merchandise, and form a
partnership with Lakehouse Music through the school. There was a release party held
on May 2<sup>nd</sup> 2013 with performances from all four artists and gifts
from sponsors. </p>
<p>Through these many accomplishments,
Blue Hawk Records is continuing their hard work in the Applied Music Industry
III class. One of the new projects of the class is an IndieGoGo campaign to
raise money to record more music. The label is also having an event on December
4<sup>th</sup> to release the next compilation CD. It will include performances
from the four artists on the previous compilation as well as two new artists,
Kristi Hunt and James Porricelli. The group is excited to continue to thrive
and make a mark on Monmouth University’s campus as well as their own careers. </p>

<p><b>About Steve</b></p>
<p>Hi, I'm Steve. I’m a
self-taught musician of over 20 years, and I’ve been recording my own music for
over 7 years. I’m better known as being the vocalist/guitarist of punk band
“Shower With Goats”, and more recently for “Steve and the Neurotics” and my
support of  “Anonymous”. </p>
<p><b>My Goal</b></p>
<p>To start a recording
studio for in-need musicians/artists where I can record them free of charge.
To achieve this goal, I require a minimum of $5,500 to purchase the proper studio
equipment that will ensure a quality recording. I already have a large, empty space available for this project,</p>
<p><b>How I got this idea</b></p>
<p>As a long time musician, I know all too well the hardship
involved with scraping together enough money to get a decent recording of the
music I worked so hard to write. For about 7 years I’ve been recording my own
music at home with old, donated equipment. I’ve managed to get fairly decent,
demo quality results with what I have to work with.</p>
<p>While browsing through indiegogo and campaign sites of this
nature, I’ve come across many artists campaigning for $5,000 to $10,000 to
record just one album. I thought to myself… “Wow, I can build a pretty nice
recording studio for that amount of money that can record infinite albums!”</p>
<p><b>Why this is a good idea</b></p>
<p>Like myself, there are
many artists/musicians out there who don’t necessarily want to become rock
stars. They just want an opportunity to have a nice recording of the piece they
worked so hard to write. Something they can be proud of. Something they can
share with others to invoke thought or emotion via the piece they’ve recorded.
Because in my eyes, that’s what being a musician is all about. </p>
<p>At $25 to $50 per hour
being the average rate of time in a professional recording studio, this can be
difficult to achieve. This is where I want to come in. This is the difference that I want to make.</p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hey everyone! My name is Brett Hystad and I lead worship at Second Baptist Church West Campus in Houston, Texas. I am finishing up my first record - ""Holding My Heart"". I am very excited to see this project be finished. I started recording last fall and I am beyond ready to have this finished! I am humbled that you would give me the time to explain this project to you! I beyond appreciate any help rather financially or just getting the word out! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Hopefully when people hear this record, I pray that they would see Christ more than any musician or songwriter.  I know that without Him, this whole process would have been impossible. I am hoping to share a small piece of what Christ has taught me through this music. I desire to see people come to know the love of Jesus Christ and what He has done for us!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am hoping to raise $2,500 for this project for two reasons. First, I need right around $2,000 to have the EP duplicated and the CDs made professionally. Second, I am using the remaining donations for promotional purposes and t-shirts. If I don't reach my goal, every penny of the donations will go to the duplication. For all those who donate, I will get you a copy of the CD asap and hopefully a t-shirt in the future!</p>

<p>As you can see in the picture above, when I was very small, my Mom made me take piano lessons.  I hated to practice and always showed disapproval!  Now that I have grown, I'm so glad she did!  You can read all about me in an interview with Shardul Pandey from his webpage entitled Shardul Pandey Talks on Sangkrit.net. Here's the link:  </p>
<p><a href=""http://sangkrit.net/2013/09/20/shardul-pandey-talks-to-don-duvall/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://sangkrit.net/2013/09/20/shardul-pandey-talks-to-don-duvall/</a></p>
<p>I have written songs that I'm proud of. I believe my tunes represent a solid foundation that results in a saleable commodity. I have got to say that I have very high hopes for the tunes I am trying to put out there. They are the kind of tunes that appeal to many different listeners’ tastes. </p>
<p>Over the last 4 decades, I've put a lot of my time (even when I should have been doing other things!) into writing songs that were commercially viable and I'm looking forward to getting them out there for everyone to listen to. I have a record executive who is very excited about working with me and he has a full blown studio with studio musicians that are really top notch. They’re the ones who will turn my tunes into a complete work of art. Although I feel as if I am very gifted musician, studio musicians have a way of making you hear things that you never heard before and present your great ideas into something even more rewarding to the ear! With help from you it’s all possible.</p>
<p>All my ducks are in a row and I’m ready to commit to a complete success at fulfilling my dreams. Most all of my money from you will go toward the preparation of my tunes at the recording studio and studio musicians.If I were to get more money than I ask for it will mean I can do even more songs in the studio depending on the amount. </p>
<p>I am 60 years old and although I am still going strong, I want to try and make sure I have something left behind for my family to listen to when I'm gone and say ""That was my Dad, Grandpa, Husband or even Friend"" when I'm gone. I have many pictures over the years and although they are worth a thousand words, sounds can be worth a thousand pictures when combined together. I wish I had a good quality song of my Mom when she was still alive singing. She was a tremendous pianist/vocalist, but never took it to the next level that I did. </p>
<p>I have been a musician since high school and actually made my living playing, raised a family, we've always had a roof over our heads and a decent car to drive, As you know however as we get older things change. I now resort to playing very part time and get the most rewards in my little studio, writing songs and singing for that ""invisible"" audience. I hope to someday share my efforts with a large group of listeners who hopefully will appreciate the time and work I have put into this over the years. All of my perks will be awarded if the project fully funds only.

<p>BIOGRAPHY:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Nubian</span> born ""Brittany Chatmon-Lester"",started singing at about the age of seven in the children’s gospel choir at her grandmother’s church. She grew up in Buffalo, New York and is the eldest of four children. At the age of twelve Nubian traveled to various places within the United States with her mother and three siblings; it was around this time when Nubian discovered her enthusiasm for performing, using her family and friends as an audience. By the age of fifteen her hidden talent began to shine through ""Hip-Hop"". In 2003 Nubian returned to her hometown of Buffalo where she started ""<em>Lyrical Disciplez Entertainment”. </em>Nubian’s music covers a plethora of topics from: struggle and pain, to life and love. Her soulful voice and deep lyrics are very relatable, and will touch every individual no matter their background. Using her music as a platform to tell her story, she describes her life growing up as rough. Through adolescence and into early adulthood Nubian was affected by the rough streets of Buffalo, having been stabbed on one occasion, beat with a bat on another, and pistol whipped and robbed at gunpoint. In addition to the violence that plagued this young’s rapstress life, she battled poverty and homelessness, as well as the loss of her musical mentor: her grandmother. After working many collection jobs Nubian decided she had had enough. Stepping out on faith, Nubian quit her job to pursue her musical career full time. Nubian struggled to hold down a stable place of residence, while juggling performing at out of town shows. Throwing all of her finances into funding her dream, Nubian continues to open up for many rap Artists including: Cory Gunz, Maino, Roscoe Dash, Cassidy, Papoose and Red Cafe. With her love of God and strong belief in her dreams she will keep striving until she grabs hold to that shining star. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This Campaign I am starting called ""New Year for Nubian"" is basically to take my career to the next level.  I have had my failures as well as accomplishments. I am a very driven person. When one or two doors close, I will bust through the next door. I come from the rough streets of Buffalo,New York(which is the 10th dangerous place in the USA). I don't want to become another statistic. I want to show people that dreams can come true. I want to also give back once I am in a better financial position by making music programs for the youth as an outlet. I believe there is so much violence in my city because the youth don't feel like anyone cares for them and they need positive people around to show them the way. My great grandmother was my musical mentor. She was big on peace and she is the reason I am musically inclined. She passed from cancer. I also want to start a ""Cure for Cancer"" foundation. My ideas are endless. I need funding to execute these ideas into action. </p>

<h3>My 'funsized' Story</h3>
<p>Hey Everyone, </p>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Brenna Rhea. I am an actress and a model with a vivid imagination and a knack for dipping my hands into all things creative. I recently recorded and released my first single, <strong>'13 Knots'</strong>, on January 16, 2012 along with its music video debut at the Mint. After its premerie and the release of my single I found myself with a great amount of people who couldn't wait to hear and see what was next... <em><u>Well folks, this is it!</u></em> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a reader, writer, blogger, and now songwriter I have officially come up with a song, storyboard, and concept for my next music video. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>My last song and video was a story about a young girl in the 1800s who witnesses a muder and because of it gets hung on false accusations. The song itself is a haunting peice with lyrics, that if listened to closely, will tell a story all by itself. The video, directed by, <strong>JFRobinson</strong>, is a sad tale spun with great cinematography that competely encompases the viewer into the life of this young girl. Through my vision, JFRobinson, completed a music video that only added to the eerie yet sad story of <strong>'13 Knots'</strong>. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>So to follow in the footsteps of my last video, I decided to do another period peice. This time the music video will be <em>set back in the days of the 1940s</em> when Mobsters ran the town and <strong>love was just as romantic as the guns that wielded it.</strong> With a storyline that mirrors that of <u>'Public Enemies'</u> with the romantic gestures of <u>'True Romance'</u> you will be taken on a completely <font size=""3"">black and white</font> adventure with a girl in love with a Mobster Boss and her entanglement in the life of his choices. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Song is labeled <font size=""6"">'Bullets'.</font> </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact of The Bullet</h3>
<p>My goal is <strong>to bring back music videos that actually tell stories and have meaning</strong>. No more booty bouncing, booby jiggiling, sexual inunendo nonsense. Although interesting and entertaining in its own way, my goal is to bring people not only music that opens up lives of various individuals but allows the viewer of the video to feel as though they were a part of something, much like a short film. Within the realm of 3 to 4 minutes I want to accomplish <u>a story that takes your breath away, gives you chills, and makes you think</u>. Much like my last video, the comments and reviews seemed to deem my vision worthy of such emotion. I want to bring my voice, <em>compared to Marilyn mixed with Nancy Sinatra</em>, to the table of a new era of music only the <strong>'post apocalyptic'</strong> world of 2012 could handle. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>My goal, according to the budget plan, is to raise around <strong>9,000.00</strong>. The last video I did was around <strong>3,000.00</strong> which was all raised through <u>fans, family, friends and out of pocket expenses</u>. And for that amount of money, I think it looks pretty good. But now I'm ready to take the bull by the horns, get some real equipment and shoot out a great video that will truly be an inspiration for music artists to come. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>The money donated will be distrubted to all aspects of the making of the film listed below:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong> </p>
<p><strong>Equipment</strong>: Lighting, Cameras, Lens, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Props</strong>: Guns, period peices, interior desgins, etc. </p>
<p><strong>Costumes</strong>: 1940s Outfits, Zoot Suits, Female Mobster Wear etc.</p>
<p><strong>Crew</strong>: I want to pay the crew this time around</p>
<p><strong>Cast:</strong> I want to pay the cast this around. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><font size=""4"">The goal is 9,000.00</font> </p>
<p>If the goal is not met I will still go on with the filming but that means not getting to pay the <em>amazing people that I work with.</em> And everyone knows what its like to work for free, although a great experience, <strong>its good to get rewarded for hard work and time spent.</strong> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><font size=""4"">So What do you get for donating?</font> </p>

</div></div>","My 'funsized' Story
Hey Everyone, 
 
My name is Brenna Rhea. I am an actress and a model with a vivid imagination and a knack for dipping my hands into all things creative. I recently recorded and released my first single, '13 Knots', on January 16, 2012 along with its music video debut at the Mint. After its premerie and the release of my single I found myself with a great amount of people who couldn't wait to hear and see what was next... Well folks, this is it! 
 
As a reader, writer, blogger, and now songwriter I have officially come up with a song, storyboard, and concept for my next music video. 
 
My last song and video was a story about a young girl in the 1800s who witnesses a muder and because of it gets hung on false accusations. The song itself is a haunting peice with lyrics, that if listened to closely, will tell a story all by itself. The video, directed by, JFRobinson, is a sad tale spun with great cinematography that competely encompases the viewer into the life of this young girl. Through my vision, JFRobinson, completed a music video that only added to the eerie yet sad story of '13 Knots'. 
 
So to follow in the footsteps of my last video, I decided to do another period peice. This time the music video will be set back in the days of the 1940s when Mobsters ran the town and love was just as romantic as the guns that wielded it. With a storyline that mirrors that of 'Public Enemies' with the romantic gestures of 'True Romance' you will be taken on a completely black and white adventure with a girl in love with a Mobster Boss and her entanglement in the life of his choices. 
 
The Song is labeled 'Bullets'. 


The Impact of The Bullet
My goal is to bring back music videos that actually tell stories and have meaning. No more booty bouncing, booby jiggiling, sexual inunendo nonsense. Although interesting and entertaining in its own way, my goal is to bring people not only music that opens up lives of various individuals but allows the viewer of the video to feel as though they were a part of something, much like a short film. Within the realm of 3 to 4 minutes I want to accomplish a story that takes your breath away, gives you chills, and makes you think. Much like my last video, the comments and reviews seemed to deem my vision worthy of such emotion. I want to bring my voice, compared to Marilyn mixed with Nancy Sinatra, to the table of a new era of music only the 'post apocalyptic' world of 2012 could handle. 
 
My goal, according to the budget plan, is to raise around 9,000.00. The last video I did was around 3,000.00 which was all raised through fans, family, friends and out of pocket expenses. And for that amount of money, I think it looks pretty good. But now I'm ready to take the bull by the horns, get some real equipment and shoot out a great video that will truly be an inspiration for music artists to come. 
 

What We Need & What You Get
The money donated will be distrubted to all aspects of the making of the film listed below:
 
Equipment: Lighting, Cameras, Lens, etc.
Props: Guns, period peices, interior desgins, etc. 
Costumes: 1940s Outfits, Zoot Suits, Female Mobster Wear etc.
Crew: I want to pay the crew this time around
Cast: I want to pay the cast this around. 
 
The goal is 9,000.00 
If the goal is not met I will still go on with the filming but that means not getting to pay the amazing people that I work with. And everyone knows what its like to work for free, although a great experience, its good to get rewarded for hard work and time spent. 
 
So What do you get for donating? 
Well heres the dreakdown:
 
10.00 - Copy Of Both Songs, '13 Knots' & 'Bullets' 
50.00 - Copy of Both Songs, '13 Knots' & 'Bullets', a signed picture, and a 'Special Thanks To' Credit

<h3>The $1 Campaign</h3>
<p>A startling, yet simple idea to enable independent recording artist Homemadesoul to create and release music for years to come.</p>
<p>Homemadesoul, a Philadelphia native was born into a musical family.  His musical rawness was developed while singing in church with his brother and sister, alongside his father.  After finishing grade school and a failed attempt at studying architecture in college, he enlisted in the Air Force.  It is there where he discovered his true passion for creating music.</p>
<p>All an artist wants is for his or her music to be heard.  Homemadesoul is no different.  Which is why Homemadesoul is willing to offer a lifetime digital supply of his music to those who donate just $1.</p>
<p>This may sound crazy.  You may think, this guy is degrading music.  But when you think of the very importance that music has in our daily lives, you will find that music is actually priceless!  Homemadesoul does not NEED to get rich from his music sales.  He doesn't even NEED to break even on his work of putting out great music.  Homemadesoul just NEEDS your ears.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>You give $1</strong></p>
<p><strong>You get a lifetime digital supply of Homemadesoul music, which includes future singles, albums, EP's, and freebies.</strong></p>
<p>Once you donate, you will be included on that special list, that will recieve <strong>ALL</strong> future releases from Homemadesoul.  <strong>No gimmicks, hidden deals, no small print.  REAL SIMPLE!<br/></strong></p>
<p>The goal is to raise $10,000 from 10,000 supporters.  This amount will be enough to pay for the mixing and mastering of the actual singles, or albums that will be released.  It will also pay for minimal promotion, cd manufacturing when needed, and to pay session musicians when needed.</p>
<p>If we have 10,000 supporters, that will be 10,000 people who will recieve new music the instant it is released.  You would be recieving an email with a download link from the Homemadesoul servers.</p>
<p><br/>If we don't raise the $10,000, we will take the funds that are raised, and continue on with the dream of simply creating and sharing music to all who will listen.  The $10,000 is just a goal to cover only expenses.  If only $500 is raised, then only 500 people will be on that special lifetime list.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This campaign draws attention to the real value of music.  The only reason why music today is valued so high is because there is a whole industry who depends on the profits made from music.  It is almost impossible for any industry artist, producer, executive, to offer great music for virtually free personal use, because their lives depend on the money made.  Homemadesoul does not have this need.  He is in the unique position to share his musical gift with the world without fear of going broke, or not being able to take care of his family.  So with this gift of musical and economic freedom, Homemadesoul offers his gift, for a lifetime, for a small donation.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are not able to contribute, it's okay!  Remember, it's not all about the money anyway.  Maybe you would like to share your talents as well.</p>
<p><br/>If your a songwriter, let's collab! </p>
<p>If your a producer, let's work!</p>
<p>If your a musician, let's create!</p>
<p>Homemadesoul also pays out mechanical royalties for collaborators who agree. And there is also the PRO royalties (ASCAP, BMI, SESAC) that come if any release is played on internet or radio.  All releases are released to all major online retailers and all sales are tracked and recorded.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT'S NEEDED</strong></p>
<p>Public Relations specialist, biography writers, bloggers, journalists, DJ'S</p>
<p><br/>If your just a supporter of great music, and still can't pay, but you have no musical gift to share, just spread the word!</p>
<p>There is room for any and everybody in this campaign!</p>

<h3>Baby Layla's Story</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Hi! </p>
<p></p>
<div>Our names our Todd and Stephanie Knopp and we are the proud parents of two amazing little girls. Our eldest daughter is named McKenna and she is almost 2, who, up until now has been our biggest priority and biggest joy in our lives! I say up until now, because she just recently (on January 7, 2014) had a little sister enter the world, and due to the complications of her sisters health has had to quickly learn that mommy and daddies attention would be split between the two of them.<p></p>
<p></p>
<div>Layla Rose Knopp is already a miracle in our eyes - born 4 weeks before her due date, she proved many people wrong by making it far past the 25 weeks we were told we would have to deliver her by.<p></p>
<p></p>
<div>At 18 weeks pregnant, Stephanie went in for her routine ultrasound (in our eyes really just to find out our babies gender), and were told we would have to return in a couple of weeks because they weren't able to see everything that they needed. We took it as a fluke and simply another opportunity to see our baby! When we returned at 20 weeks pregnant, much to our surprise they were still unable to see what they needed to and later were told that the amniotic fluid around our baby was low and that we would need to see Maternal Fetal Medicine (MFM) for a more detailed ultrasound to determine cause/treatment.<p></p>
<p></p>
<div>At 22 weeks pregnant, we went in for our first (soon to be MANY, MANY, MANY) appointments with MFM. It was confirmed at this point that yes, the amniotic fluid was low and we met with a perinatologist who explained to us the complications that could occur because of this. He also informed us that between the babies 18 week ultrasound and 22nd that they hadn't seen any growth and he was concerned that the two things could mean several complications (growth restriction, organ abnormalities (heart, kidney issues), and/or a genetic disorder such as Down's syndrome. We also were told that our baby was a little girl, but obviously at this point in the conversation, we realized that the gender was really the last thing for us to be concerned with.<p></p>
<p></p>
<div>At our next appointment her fluids had dropped into the danger zone, and her growth proved that she was not gaining anything, and she was diagnosed with Oligohydramnios (low fluids) and IUGR (intra-uterine growth restriction), and we were told to prepare that at week 25 we would be in the hospital and probably delivering her soon after. Thankfully at her 25 week appointment we saw a slight increase of growth and fluids so we were able to stay out of the hospital for another week.<p></p>
<p></p>
<div>Fast forward several weeks (mainly because as many appointments as we had this could be a novel) and we had been having weekly ultrasounds and bi-weekly NST's to measure fluid levels, growth, and her placenta's Doppler flow, as well as to check to make sure she was not going into stress. During this time, it was an ever going roller coaster with one week fluids up and one week fluids down, several times her diagnosis of low fluids had even been removed , however the growth restriction was still a problem. <p></p>
<p></p>
<div>For the 3 weeks leading up to her induction, everything had been looking great! Fluids were relatively normal, and her size was in the 10th percentile (just at the tip of not being growth restricted), we really started to believe at this point that we could have a baby with NO ISSUES and us, as well as our family started to believe that maybe the doctors had been being over cautious about the circumstances.<p></p>
<p></p>
<div>At Stephanie's 36 week check up,  Layla's growth had shot through the roof! She was now in the 25th percentile, and no longer IUGR! Unfortunately, her fluid went from 12.8 to 2 and Stephanie was told she would be induced that day. Reluctantly, we took their advice, still thinking that this was all for nothing and she would be a perfectly healthy little girl!<p></p>
<p></p>
<div>Stephanie's induction started on Monday evening and Layla was born on Tuesday night at 10:41pm! She was 5 lb. and 6.5 oz and definitely NOT IUGR! She was placed immediately on Stephanie's chest however immediately removed because she was having issues breathing. They informed us she would be taken to NICU (Neo-natal intensive care unit) and Todd followed the nurses as they took her.<p></p>
<p></p>
<div>Well that leads us to today. Layla has been in the NICU now for 6 days. During this stay we have learned that being premature really has nothing to do with Layla's issues, but because of the low fluids she encountered during the pregnancy, her lungs were not able to develop, causing them to be functioning at the capacity of a MUCH younger baby. She has been keeping the nurses on their toes daily and as they jokingly say ""taking advantage of all their equipment"". She has been slowly but surely doing better and we are thanking God daily for this! We still have no clue as to how long she will be in the NICU, but the doctors tell us their estimate is anywhere from a few more weeks to a couple of months (obviously rare for a 36 week old baby).<p></p>
<p></p>
<div><div>With all the amazing blessings we have been receiving in the form of love, encouragement and financial support, it is really no wonder we are making it through this very difficult time! <p></p>
<p></p>
<div>When we were approached about this fundraising campaign, our first instinct was to say ""NO!"", it was a little pride, but also because we felt so blessed, it seemed selfish to ask for help, but after a lot of prayer, some humbling time looking over the financial obligations, a few more nudges from our family to do it, we decided to humbly accept whatever blessings people in our lives were willing to offer.<p></p>
<p></p>
<div>We want to take time to recognize the love and support from everyone we have received and thank you all for all that you do! It truly has been overwhelming the love we are getting and it, along with trusting God is our biggest factor in getting through this time! <p></p>
<p></p>
<div>We love you all and are so thankful you are here in this journey with us because we could not do it alone!<p></p>
<p></p>
<div>Love,<p></p>

<p></p>
<h3>So how can you help?</h3>
</div>
<p>1)<b>Prayer. </b>We believe that prayer has the greatest ability to positively change the course of direction for Layla and can help to sustain us emotionally and spiritually through this time. It is our belief that God answers the prayers of those who earnestly seek Him.</p>
<p></p>
<div>2)<b>Encouragement. </b>We have set up a Facebook page for Layla and Stephanie and Todd love to read your comments of support and love. Please keep them coming!<p></p>
<p></p>
<div>3)<b>Meals/Childcare.</b> If you are local, they can always use a little help with some grocery/meal help when they return from long days of errands, especially after eating hospital food as much as they are. Also, they have leaned heavily on family and church family to help take care of McKenna while at the hospital visiting Layla. Any time you can offer care for her at this time would be appreciated.<p></p>
<p></p>
<div>4)<b>Financial.</b> As mentioned earlier, we are not certain how long Layla will be in the NICU nor do we know how long she will need extra help once she returns home. We are so thankful that medical bills are being covered through insurance plans! It is estimated that a week in the NICU can cost well over 100k a week!  However, there are other areas that have the potential to create severe financial stress on the Knopp family. These include:<p></p>
<p></p>
<div>Gas and travel expenses<p></p>
<p>Uncovered medical expenses</p>
<p>Loss of income expenses (Todd is required to take unpaid leave during this time)</p>
<p>Daycare expenses (if needed)</p>
<p>Meal expenses while traveling</p>
<p>Unknown expenses caring for a premature baby</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Finally, the Knopp’s have family and friends that span the globe. Please share Layla’s story with them. The more people we have praying for Layla, the better.</p>
<p></p>
<div>Let’s bring Layla home - healthy, safely and soon!<p></p>

Baby Layla's Story

Hi! 

Our names our Todd and Stephanie Knopp and we are the proud parents of two amazing little girls. Our eldest daughter is named McKenna and she is almost 2, who, up until now has been our biggest priority and biggest joy in our lives! I say up until now, because she just recently (on January 7, 2014) had a little sister enter the world, and due to the complications of her sisters health has had to quickly learn that mommy and daddies attention would be split between the two of them.

Layla Rose Knopp is already a miracle in our eyes - born 4 weeks before her due date, she proved many people wrong by making it far past the 25 weeks we were told we would have to deliver her by.

At 18 weeks pregnant, Stephanie went in for her routine ultrasound (in our eyes really just to find out our babies gender), and were told we would have to return in a couple of weeks because they weren't able to see everything that they needed. We took it as a fluke and simply another opportunity to see our baby! When we returned at 20 weeks pregnant, much to our surprise they were still unable to see what they needed to and later were told that the amniotic fluid around our baby was low and that we would need to see Maternal Fetal Medicine (MFM) for a more detailed ultrasound to determine cause/treatment.

At 22 weeks pregnant, we went in for our first (soon to be MANY, MANY, MANY) appointments with MFM. It was confirmed at this point that yes, the amniotic fluid was low and we met with a perinatologist who explained to us the complications that could occur because of this. He also informed us that between the babies 18 week ultrasound and 22nd that they hadn't seen any growth and he was concerned that the two things could mean several complications (growth restriction, organ abnormalities (heart, kidney issues), and/or a genetic disorder such as Down's syndrome. We also were told that our baby was a little girl, but obviously at this point in the conversation, we realized that the gender was really the last thing for us to be concerned with.

At our next appointment her fluids had dropped into the danger zone, and her growth proved that she was not gaining anything, and she was diagnosed with Oligohydramnios (low fluids) and IUGR (intra-uterine growth restriction), and we were told to prepare that at week 25 we would be in the hospital and probably delivering her soon after. Thankfully at her 25 week appointment we saw a slight increase of growth and fluids so we were able to stay out of the hospital for another week.

Fast forward several weeks (mainly because as many appointments as we had this could be a novel) and we had been having weekly ultrasounds and bi-weekly NST's to measure fluid levels, growth, and her placenta's Doppler flow, as well as to check to make sure she was not going into stress. During this time, it was an ever going roller coaster with one week fluids up and one week fluids down, several times her diagnosis of low fluids had even been removed , however the growth restriction was still a problem. 

For the 3 weeks leading up to her induction, everything had been looking great! Fluids were relatively normal, and her size was in the 10th percentile (just at the tip of not being growth restricted), we really started to believe at this point that we could have a baby with NO ISSUES and us, as well as our family started to believe that maybe the doctors had been being over cautious about the circumstances.

At Stephanie's 36 week check up,  Layla's growth had shot through the roof! She was now in the 25th percentile, and no longer IUGR! Unfortunately, her fluid went from 12.8 to 2 and Stephanie was told she would be induced that day. Reluctantly, we took their advice, still thinking that this was all for nothing and she would be a perfectly healthy little girl!

Stephanie's induction started on Monday evening and Layla was born on Tuesday night at 10:41pm! She was 5 lb. and 6.5 oz and definitely NOT IUGR! She was placed immediately on Stephanie's chest however immediately removed because she was having issues breathing. They informed us she would be taken to NICU (Neo-natal intensive care unit) and Todd followed the nurses as they took her.

Well that leads us to today. Layla has been in the NICU now for 6 days. During this stay we have learned that being premature really has nothing to do with Layla's issues, but because of the low fluids she encountered during the pregnancy, her lungs were not able to develop, causing them to be functioning at the capacity of a MUCH younger baby. She has been keeping the nurses on their toes daily and as they jokingly say ""taking advantage of all their equipment"". She has been slowly but surely doing better and we are thanking God daily for this! We still have no clue as to how long she will be in the NICU, but the doctors tell us their estimate is anywhere from a few more weeks to a couple of months (obviously rare for a 36 week old baby).

With all the amazing blessings we have been receiving in the form of love, encouragement and financial support, it is really no wonder we are making it through this very difficult time! 

When we were approached about this fundraising campaign, our first instinct was to say ""NO!"", it was a little pride, but also because we felt so blessed, it seemed selfish to ask for help, but after a lot of prayer, some humbling time looking over the financial obligations, a few more nudges from our family to do it, we decided to humbly accept whatever blessings people in our lives were willing to offer.

We want to take time to recognize the love and support from everyone we have received and thank you all for all that you do! It truly has been overwhelming the love we are getting and it, along with trusting God is our biggest factor in getting through this time! 

We love you all and are so thankful you are here in this journey with us because we could not do it alone!

Love,

-Todd, Stephanie, McKenna, and Baby Layla


















So how can you help?

1)Prayer. We believe that prayer has the greatest ability to positively change the course of direction for Layla and can help to sustain us emotionally and spiritually through this time. It is our belief that God answers the prayers of those who earnestly seek Him.

2)Encouragement. We have set up a Facebook page for Layla and Stephanie and Todd love to read your comments of support and love. Please keep them coming!

3)Meals/Childcare. If you are local, they can always use a little help with some grocery/meal help when they return from long days of errands, especially after eating hospital food as much as they are. Also, they have leaned heavily on family and church family to help take care of McKenna while at the hospital visiting Layla. Any time you can offer care for her at this time would be appreciated.

4)Financial. As mentioned earlier, we are not certain how long Layla will be in the NICU nor do we know how long she will need extra help once she returns home. We are so thankful that medical bills are being covered through insurance plans! It is estimated that a week in the NICU can cost well over 100k a week!  However, there are other areas that have the potential to create severe financial stress on the Knopp family. These include:

Gas and travel expenses
Uncovered medical expenses
Loss of income expenses (Todd is required to take unpaid leave during this time)
Daycare expenses (if needed)
Meal expenses while traveling
Unknown expenses caring for a premature baby




Finally, the Knopp’s have family and friends that span the globe. Please share Layla’s story with them. The more people we have praying for Layla, the better.

Let’s bring Layla home - healthy, safely and soon!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><i>ABOUT ""THE CROSSING""</i></h3>
<p>We are Cantrip. Known for our innovative arrangements, un-produced sound and live energy, we have already been lucky enough to bring our music to many exciting places across the globe. For nearly a decade and a half we have been performing our own brand of traditional music across multiple continents. Inevitably, we have gone through a number of transitional periods. We are now an intercontinental band, spread across the ocean by family necessity. But the direction of our music has only brought us closer together as a unit, and for the first time in five years we are putting together an album of new material. This album will be titled ""The Crossing"", and we are giddy with excitement. It will be a collection of songs and tunes, original and traditional. We are including a large number of our own compositions, as well as nods to some of our favorite artists of today. Every piece of music we have included in this project we feel is our own. We're ready to share them with you.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>
<i style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">WE NEED YOUR HELP</i><br/>
</h3>
<p>In order to make this project a reality, we need to raise funds. The unfortunate truth is that we are all professional musicians with families living an ocean apart. As of now, it takes all the resources we can muster just to get the three of us in the same room. We can't find the money to release an album without some sort of help. Luckily in today's world, there are avenues of fundraising that haven't existed before, and with your help we can make this album exist.</p>
<p>It costs a lot to make an album these days. Some of the projected expenses for this project include:</p>
<p>• Studio time for recording and mixing</p>
<p>• Mastering</p>
<p>• Artwork/Graphic Design</p>
<p>• Reproduction</p>
<p>• Promotion</p>
<p>• Artist royalties</p>
<p>We're asking for $5,000. We feel this amount will get us to the finish line. However, if your generosity exceeds this figure it will be that much easier for us to share our music with more people, as well as presenting the best possible product. We are not the type of band that would belabor our time in the studio. This will be a very live project, much like our performances. But we want to capture and present this in the best way we possibly can. This means enlisting the help of high level professionals. We are working with Mill Pond Music Studio in Portsmouth, NH for recording and mixing. Our mastering will be done in Scotland by the engineer for our past two studio albums. We are working with an artist and a graphic designer for the cover and booklet. Disc Makers is one of the leading CD reproduction companies, and we will be enlisting their services. And of course, we want to make sure the composers of the music we perform get the bread they are due. </p>
<p>Most albums cost anywhere between $8,000 and $30,000 to make. We believe that with smart preparation and execution we can release a high quality project for less, but there is always more that can be done and there is always more money that can be spent. Whatever we receive will be put to good use, you can be assured. </p>
<p>For your extremely gracious support, we would like to do what we can to give back to you. You may think of contributing to this campaign as a means of pre-ordering ""The Crossing"" or as something more. No matter what, our gratitude runs deep and we will personally thank you for it. By contributing here, you will receive ""The Crossing"" before it is released to the public. We want you to hear it first, so you may know where your money has gone. Your money will be going to support our creative endeavors, and the more you give, the more we can give to you. You could have tunes written for you or receive Skype lessons/interviews. You could even garner an invite to a secret release show in Massachusetts, where we will perform material new and old as well as enlisting the help of a number of musical friends. We expect this will be an evening full of spontaneity and warmth, and should kick off this project in style. We hope you will consider supporting us in this endeavor, and we look forward to sharing with you!</p>
