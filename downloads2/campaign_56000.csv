<p>I have survived
cancer three times. </p>
<p>Most recently, an
operation at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKKC) in 2013 saved my
life. My urologist Dr. Jennifer Simmons sent me to the world's expert surgeon
Dr. Paul Russo because she said no surgeon in Pennsylvania where I live had the
necessary skills. Russo removed the cancerous tumor and saved my right
kidney. </p>
<p>I was able to give
away my daughter Joanna. I was also able to do work on city planning and
disability design for a variety of academic and general publications focused on
helping the aged (I am 67) and disabled (I am a paraplegic) contribute to the
economy rather than be the problem society generally considers us to be. </p>
<p>Currently, I am in
crippling pain causing me to go to the emergency room. Sophisticated pain
relief is not available in my hometown of State College. I need an implant that
will beam radio waves to my damaged spinal nerves. </p>
<p>I need to return to
MSKKC where that technology exists to restore me to productivity </p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I am asking for $2,000 so I can return to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center deal with my cancer-related issues and receive pain reduction treatment that will insert a radio wave device that reduces pain to the point where I am no longer dependent upon drugs.</p> <ul> <li>The money will pay for bus fare to New York on Megabus.

<p>Metabolic
Alchemy was formed in the effort to spread awareness of the beauty of alchemy,
and to help people grow, heal, and learn through alchemy.  </p>
<p>We make 100% organic, plant based elixirs for health and personal development, using only natural ingredients in all of our products.  We believe that nature provides the best medicine, and nature aided by alchemy is magical.</p>
</div><div>
<p>We use the
word “metabolic” as being symbolic of one of the key concepts in alchemy, that
is: Thesis + Antithesis = Synthesis. In other words, we believe in balance.</p>
<p>Learn more at <a href=""http://www.metabolic-alchemy.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.metabolic-alchemy.com</a></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Our Current Status and Funding Needs</h3> <p>At Metabolic Alchemy, we have spent the past two years developing, testing, and refining a line of elixirs.  These are based on over 20 years of experience and study in the fields of alchemy, qabalah, mysticism, material science, and personal exploration.</p>
<p>We currently have two main product lines:</p>
<p></p>The Elements Collection - A set of five elixirs that work to balance the philosophical elements of the personality. More information on the elements collections can be found at: <a href=""http://www.metabolic-alchemy.com/pages/about-the-journey"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.metabolic-alchemy.com/pages/about-the-journey</a>
</div><div><br/></div><div>
<p>The Wellness Collection - A set of elixirs focused on sinus health, deep sleep, sexual health, and relaxation/meditation.  More about these can be found at: <a href=""http://www.metabolic-alchemy.com/collections/wellness-collection"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.metabolic-alchemy.com/collections/wellness-collection</a></p>
<p>These products are currently available on our website and we would like to enter into the wholesale market.  Since we launched at the beginning of March, we have been picked up by small local stores in Boulder, Colorado but do not currently have the resources to pursue additional orders from larger retailers.</p>
<p>We are looking to raise $25,000 to begin larger scale production and to meet the additional financial demands of wholesale sales.</p>
<p>The money raised will go to purchasing additional raw materials, upgrading our laboratory equipment for larger scale production, and to meeting FDA requirements such as having all ingredients tested by an outside laboratory.</p>
<p>We will scale our production to the amount of money raised.  The more we raise, the faster we grow.  If we do not meet our goal of $25,000, all perks will still be delivered.  There is no limit to how large we can scale, so if we exceed our goal you will be helping us grow even faster.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Why Contribute?</h3> <p>Let's face it, we live in an over medicated, over stressed society.  We've become conditioned to accept a paradigm of addressing symptoms rather than get to root issues, and then having to address the side effects of those treatments with even more surface layer treatments.</p>
<p>Metabolic Alchemy takes a different approach.  We believe that many issues can be solved naturally.  The healthiest system is a balanced system, and our elixirs are intended to do just that, bring balance.</p>
<p>By contributing to this project, you are supporting a more natural way of living.  We want to help as many people as we can in this lifetime, whether it be helping people rest, live with clearer sinuses, or grow into a better person.</p>

We are team
of young people who share passion to Street Workout. We trained together for a
year now, meeting regularly five times week in a group of average fifty persons.
We’ve had some very talented guys and girls among us but there is one thing
that blocks us from development.  We
don’t have a professional workout park.What is Street Workout
Street
Workout isa physical
activity performed mostly in outdoor parks or public facilities. It is a
combination ofathletics, calisthenics (exercises which are performed
using purely body weight), and sports. Street Workout is a modern name
for bodyweight workout in outdoor parks. In Poland, there are over the
35 local groups that practicing that kind of sport. Popularity of this discipline
is increases rapidly. 
What we need
We don’t
have professional place to train. We forced to train in spaces that are not
accessible and dangerous for us and expose us on to injuries. Our city
government don’t wont to finance workout park for us, although in other, even
smaller cites there are such parks. So we put our hope in you. We asked you for
financial support so we can build a proper training place for us. 
How much it costs
We have few
projects and build simple but well organized park is in our country cost
approximately 13700$. Collect such amount will be realization of our
dreams and allow us to develop.

We make it very clear that we are not trained as doctors or psychiatrists, but that, as reiki masters, we know that healing can be found by replacing negative sexual energy with self-embracing warmth.We've run this course for free on our website in the past, but, thanks to the feedback we received, we know that folks would prefer to own a CD of the audio visualizations (hear a free one here) so they can work at their own pace. The accompanying booklet we plan to have printed will contain the comforting, ocean-themed philosophy of self-love and deep acceptance that our participants have told us they enjoy. But it costs a lot to create CDs and booklets. (CDs, for one, must be ordered in bulk!) We'd also like to buy advertising to really spread the word. Will you, wonderful people, help us? We'd be endlessly grateful for anything you're able to give.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The previous Junior World Championships were
held in Germany and Poland and experience was gained during these 2 contests. The
team is now ready to excel at the next Junior World Gliding Championship in
Narromine Australia. We are convinced the Belgian Junior Team has the potential
to deliver the next junior world champion! Did you know that Bert jr. Schmelzer,
the current World Gliding Champion among the seniors, is a Belgian?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it’s not all about flying.
Competing at the highest level and at the other side of the world, cost a lot
of money. After some fund raising activities, we realized another approach was
needed. That’s when the crowdfunding idea came to life. With a lot of
perseverance and many meetings later, we are ready to present you our

<p><b>We need</b></p>
<p>Your help! Going to Australia and becoming
world champion won’t be easy. We already have a lot of people who offered help,
but it’s not enough. We need 65.000 euro to compete at the championship. This amount
includes renting gliders,
entry fees, shipping container, airline tickets, housing, cars rental and much
more.</p>
<p> <br/>
We don’t want to aim for the impossible. That’s why this crowdfunding is designed
to raise 45.000 euro. It is the first step to Narromine. We are currently

</h4>We're campaigning for at least $77,701 in order to bring this project up to the point of public demonstration by late 2015 to early 2016. The specific costs to complete this phase of work have been determined to be as follows:<br/><br/><ul><li>The US Department of the Interior and an university in the state of Nevada very kindly donated an underground mine fully equipped with a mechanical seismograph, offering many further opportunities for scientific research - <b>$1,000</b> - <b>Seismic Mine Insurance</b>
</li></ul><ul><li>The lab floor is awash with parts and equipment. We need to tidy up so we can organise our inventory and dismantle old equipment to reclaim useful parts - <b>$3,000</b> - <b>U-Line Industrial Shelving</b>
</li></ul><ul><li>We need to install between 20 and 40 ground rods, each to a depth of 10 to 30 metres. For this task we need special ground drilling equipment which is normally used for drilling water wells - <b>$4,000</b> - <b>Hydra-Drill from DeepRock Manufacturing</b>
</li></ul><ul><li>We've found an used Lines Truck, which is a truck that's specially designed for manoeuvring and installing telephone poles, as well as drilling the holes. We currently dig each hole by hand, and use a combination of ropes and Eric's 1981 Toyota Corolla to manipulate and erect the poles for the antenna field. This truck will save countless hours of work - <b>$4,000</b> - <b>Used Lines Truck</b>
</li></ul><ul><li>The antenna fields cover many square miles and are spread out over a large area in the Nevada desert, so getting around to do the work uses a lot of fuel. We also receive and acquire a lot of disused and unwanted equipment through donation which requires transporting back to the lab - <b>$5,000</b> - <b>1 Year Travel Expenses</b>
</li></ul><ul><li>Several poles in the antenna field are damage and need to be repaired or replaced - <b>$5,000</b> - <b>Remaining Poles &amp; Insulators</b>
</li></ul><ul><li>Loading networks consisting of coils and capacitors are used for the antenna line terminating hardware. There are 20 sections and 20 loading networks. The loading coils also require specialised cases to protect them from the elements - <b>$7,500</b> - <b>Loading Network</b>
</li></ul><ul><li>Running costs for the lab include tax, insurance and utilities - <b>$8,520</b> - <b>1 Year Building Expenses</b>
</li></ul><ul><li>We need tools and many components to assemble all the equipment, as well as meters for testing and measuring parameters - <b>$10,000</b> - <b>Tools, Meters &amp; Components</b>
</li></ul><ul><li>Since beginning to operate, EPD Labs has been paying rent to the original benefactor of the building, David Wittekind. By paying off the balance that remains from the $59,000 paid so far, the building will become under the legal ownership of EPD Labs and we will no longer have to pay monthly rent - <b>$29,681</b> - <b>Principal Balance Owed For The Building</b>

Earthquake prediction 48 hours ahead is an important technological advance and the first step in preventing repeats of events such as that at Tepco, Fukushima. Had the nuclear power station been given a sufficient warning of an impending earthquake and possible Tsunami from an instrumentation such as the advanced seismic warning system, then the nuclear reactor could have been taken offline, and more than just many lives saved but hundreds of billions of dollars could have been saved too!We propose that this technology can prevent other serious disasters as a result of earthquakes and tsunamis.

</div></div>","THE QUEST:     After being diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes on April 2, 2014, I missed only one weekend of racing. I competed in 50 races that season and was ranked the 7th best criterium rider in the country, 1st in PA, and the top 35-plus rider in America according to USA cycling.       My entire life, I rode my bike out of sticky situations, so coming up against a challenge like this was nothing new to me.LIFE BEFORE THE DAWN OF DIABETES:     My cycling career took me out of Reading, PA and around the world before I was 25.
     Beginning in the late 90’s I started racing pro mountain bikes all over America. In 2002, I jumped onto the international circuit, road racing with the US National Team all over Europe. In 2003, I landed a contract with Sportsbook.com’s  Pro cycling team and competed with some of the best riders and in some of the hardest races in the world. I rode the wave of professional cycling to some of the top ranked teams in America, such as Rite Aid and Battley Harley-Davidson. By the end of the 2013 season I started to feel fatigued. I thought I was just tired from racing the entire road and cyclocross season on my own as the one-man Team Skyline, but what I thought was fatigue turned out to be late onset Type 1 Diabetes. 
THE DIAGNOSIS AND A NEW WAY:
     After winning a few preseason races with a 500 blood glucose level, I fell over one day. A doctor was able to see me right away and ordered a set of blood tests. I almost didn’t even get the tests, because my health insurance wouldn’t cover it, but my girlfriend insisted. The tests revealed I had Type 1 Diabetes, along with a skyrocketed blood glucose level and a dangerous A1C. I was admitted into the hospital immediately, treated with insulin, and eventually released. 

     From there I had to quickly figure out how to control my BG levels on my own. I acquired all the best pumps and meters as I could afford to help me function as competitively as possible. State-of-the-art diabetes technology isn’t cheap, especially for a bike racer with limited finances and basic healthcare coverage, but I managed to get a system going and returned to racing once again.

NEW ATTITUDE/ FRESH RESULTS:
   After winning a few races with diabetes, it didn’t take long for Team Novo Nordisk, an all diabetic cycling team, to take notice. They offered me a spot on their team and gave me a place to live in Atlanta, where I had the opportunity to work with their doctors and resources. This was something I could not pass up. I loaded my car and drove to Atlanta, testing Team Skyline's sustainability. I knew I wanted the club to be around long after I was gone, but I didn’t expect to step away from the brand so soon. 



     I competed in 26 races with Team Novo Nordisk, placing in the top 5 fifteen times and winning several races. I was the most successful rider on the team by far. Yet, surprisingly, the team rejected me for a 2015 contract, telling me I was too old. This didn't stop me.


     Meanwhile, I was four months into a clinical trial study, and preparing for the final dose of the mystery drug, I learned that one of the other subjects suffered atrial fibrillation on his last dose. I remember the day when he coded and all the doctors and nurses left me in the room to sleep for a few hours. After hearing what happened to the last guy, I still went through with my final dose. I was the only one to survive the testing with no complications. 
2015 ASPIRATIONS AND STRATEGY:       The goal for the 2015 season is to continue to build Team Skyline into a community minded cycling club with a Jr. development team, women’s team, masters team, and an elite team, with a total of 75 riders for its inaugural year. With the trial coming to a close I am looking towards my next goal of competing in the 2015 National Criterium Championship, or NCC Series. I’m planning on using all the latest and greatest diabetic supplies to help preserve my pancreas and stay in the honeymoon phase of diabetes. 

        I want to use my racing and struggle to promote myself as a community minded inspirational athlete with dynamic and inspirational speaking abilities. I want to slowly make the transition from pro cyclist to telling my story about diabetes. I’d like to be an inspiration to help people overcome this disease that is affecting so many Americans, with emphasis on the youth. In the support of diabetes, I plan on donating all my prize money from the 2015 season to the JDRF foundation, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.        I’m going to need support from all my friends and fellow diabetics to perform at the highest level of racing in the US. 
       I developed Team Skyline into a top level elite racing team. Kyle Wamsley, a former top level pro racer and ex teammate, is coming out of retirement to help with the cause. Garrett Olsen, a Boeing engineer, is on leave from his career to help the cause and David Dawson is our development rider; fresh out of college with a engineering degree, committed to racing before he enters the engineering world. With these riders by my side and the support of others, I’m going to give my best to show how much you can do with diabetes.     Thank you for your consideration in donating to the “Winning the Race With Diabetes Fund”. Our goal is to raise $100,000 to support the team, the mission, and to get us to races where we can inspire people with diabetes to not stop living the life they dreamed of.Regards,

</div></div>","KREATE A PETLOVABLE PETS YOU CREATE
Kreate a Pet is a stuffed animal that has removable and attachable parts that can be attached anywhere on the animal.  The parts have a small “hook” patch that allows them to stick anywhere on the animal’s “loop” fabric, similar to Velcro.  Kids can stick an ear on the leg, put a wing on the head, or put them anywhere on the Kreate a Pet.  No glue, no pins, no hard parts, no sockets, no magnets, and no mess – just soft parts to place anywhere on the animal.
         

Katarina, who is 12 years old, is a creative child who invented and designed Kreate a Pet when she was only 10.  
In her words:

""I have owned over a
1,000 stuffed animals since I was a baby.  I often wanted to change the
parts around on them to create my own animals that were funny, cute, or weird
but I never wanted to cut them up.  So I thought: How could I do it?""   

""Then one day I was playing with Velcro, the light bulb
went off and I began the first Kreate a Pet design and soon after my
company was formed, Kat's Toys, LLC.""

""Every kid who has seen and played with the Kreate a Pet loves it so much and wants to play with it over and over.  Many parents feel that it is educational and want their children to have something to play with other than video games.  I am so happy to have this opportunity to share my invention with all the kids of the world.""



Katarina's father, Richard Mathews, a seasoned business owner and executive, is leading the company's efforts to bring this exciting and fun new toy to a worldwide market.  


                         Katarina and her Dad, Richard Mathews


To
date, we have designed the first 2 products and filed applicable patents and
are now in full production of the Kreate a Pet and Stikkie Board (described below). We have products for sale in
several toy stores in Southern California. Additionally we just signed with a
top Sales Representative firm to bring the products to many more stores in the
Western states.  We plan to expand our marketing and sales efforts thru
representation and distribution nationwide and worldwide.  
We also launched our website, www.kreateapet.com to begin online sales and promotion.  Finally, we produced a professional online commercial for the Kreate a Pet and Stikkie Board toys that can be viewed on our website, as well as on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5m0Fy-ydHE.  

                              

Our
products have worldwide market potential and they have no gender, racial,
ethnic, or cultural barriers.  We are also designing additional Kreate a Pet models including dinosaurs,
monsters, birds, fish, insects, and even cars, airplanes, and boats...all with
the same concept of sticking the parts anywhere on the pet, airplane, or
whatever.  All parts for all models will be interchange-able to allow mix
and match.  Imagine a propeller on a fish or wings on a boat, or antlers
on a truck!

                                                     


STIKKIE BOARDS

With Stikkie Boards you can display your Kreate a Pet and store
your Stikkie Parts. 

                       
     Kreate a Pet and Stikkie Parts STICK to the Stikkie Board

You can stick your
Kreate a Pet animal onto the Stikkie Board using the little Stikkies that make
the animal stick to the Stikkie Board.  The Stikkie Board can be placed
almost anywhere and can be stuck to most any wall with Stikkies.


                             

The Stikkie Board is 12 inches by 12
inches by 1 inch and is very lightweight…it is only 3 ounces so it is easy for
your child to play with.  It is a rigid
foam board covered with a soft velour fabric. 
The fabric is the same as the Kreate a Pet. 

                                                 
The Stikkie Board is 100% Made in America.  All materials within the Stikkie Board are Made in America and the product is assembled by our workers in America.


STIKKIES
Stikkies
are dime size hook patches that have hook properties on either a single side or
both sides. 
                       


               DIME SIZE




The double sided Stikkies allow the child to “hook” together any or many of the
Kreate a Pet creatures and also allow the pet to be adhered to the Stikkie
Board. 

This will allow play to include stacking and connecting any number of Kreate a Pet’s together for “piggy-back” rides, pyramids, or whatever configuration the child can create. 




                                                   


STIKKIE PARTS


Stikkie Parts are Kreate a Pet animal parts that include eyes, ears, antlers, wings, noses, mouths, trunk, and tail. 





All of the Stikkie Parts feature a hook patch that allows the part to adhere to the loop velour body fabric of the Kreate a Pet creature and the Stikkie Board. 



    


Each Kreate a Pet comes with a set of Stikkie Parts.  Additional sets of Stikkie Parts can be purchased to provide more parts for your Kreate a Pet to create ever more interesting designs.  The Stikkie Parts can also be used with the Stikkie Board to make faces or any type of design that you can imagine. Currently in design are many additional parts that will soon be available. ....making the Kreate a Pet even more fun and exciting for your child.

<p>To limit these risks, we have contracted manufacturing partners that have produced countless consumer electronics products and are fully capable of scaling our business. What’s more, they are located within a 20 min drive from our HQ, which enables us to closely oversee production and immediately deal with any issues that may appear. </p>
<p>On the other end, we have selected experienced logistics partners to ensure that shipping goes smoothly and on time.</p>

<h4><b><span>Who should buy Emerald Air?</span></b></h4>
<p><span>It’s for anyone and everyone who cares about their health and well-being. We rarely realize how indoor air affects our health. Breathing in even small amounts of harmful substances causes headaches, lowers productivity, leads to asthma or allergies, and even increases the risk of cancer - and you don’t even know when it happens. That’s why we have created Emerald Air - to help you see what’s invisible and give you a chance to protect your family from sickness and discomfort.</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><b>Technical Questions</b></h3>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<p><b>How small is Emerald and how much does it weigh?</b></p>
<p><span>Emerald measures 2.1x2.1x0.6 inch (55x55x15mm) and only weighs 3.45 ounces (98 grams).</span></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<p><b>What are the ambient operating conditions of Emerald?</b></p>
<p>The ambient temperature range is from 41°F (5°C) to 149°F (65°C), and the relative humidity range is from 0-95%.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b><span>How does Emerald measure air quality?</span></b></p>
<p><span>Emerald measures air pollution in real time, detecting a wide range of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). It alerts you when your home or office air becomes not safe.</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b><span>How often does Emerald take an update its air measurements?</span></b></p>
<p><span>Emerald takes measurements of its environment once every minute when you are at home. When you’re out, Emerald does it every 15 minutes and then displays the results in a chart on the mobile app to give you the picture of the last 24 hours. But you can also choose a mode that on demand takes measurements every 3s.</span><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Does Emerald have its dedicated mobile app?</b></p>
<p><span>Of course! We have created a mobile app for iOS 9+ and Android 4.3+ devices with Bluetooth Low Energy support. You can download it already from the App Store and Google Play</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Is the Emerald Air mobile app free?</b></p>
<p><span>Absolutely! The Emerald Air app is free to use, and there are no additional subscriptions. We also provide free software updates, so that your Emeralds get even smarter over time.</span><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><span><b>How many Emeralds can you connect to the mobile app?</b></span><br/></p>
<p>You can connect up to 5 emeralds to your mobile app.</p>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<span><b>Will the app also have the temperature in Fahrenheit, inHg for barometric pressure measurement and a 12-hour clock?</b></span><br/>
</div>
<div>Y<span>es, it can be configured to Celsius/Fahrenheit, hPa/inHg and a 12/24-hour clock. </span> <br/>
</div>
<p><br/><b><span>Will there be continued support/updates for the app?</span></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Yes! We have a long roadmap for new features and are committed to perfecting the system. If you have any suggestions, please contact our team.</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span><b>Do Emerald sensors require an Internet connection?</b></span><br/></p>
<p><span>Emerald sensors can send your data directly to your iOS or Android smartphone via Bluetooth Low Energy, so you don’t need to be connected to the internet.</span><br/></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<p><span><b>Can you use Emerald without a smartphone?</b></span><br/></p>
<p><span>Yes, you can touch the Emerald logo on the case. The device will then do a quick measurement and light up green or red depending on the air quality. Green - everything is ok, but red means that something is wrong with your environment, and </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">you need to consult your mobile app. The Airadicate purifier can work autonomously even without the app or the Emerald sensor.</span><span><br/></span><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span><b>Can you get phone alerts about your environment?</b></span><br/></p>
<p><span>Yes, you receive notifications in the mobile app if a problem appears along with a description and tips &amp; tricks on how to fix it in the easiest way.</span><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><span><b>Is Emerald powered by a battery?</b></span></p>
<p><span>Emerald has a built-in 1000 mAh rechargeable battery which you’ll need to recharge just a few times per year (depending on usage). You can recharge your Emerald with any standard certified micro-USB mobile charger that you use for your phone. A micro USB cable is also included with every product.</span><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>How long will the battery last?</b></p>
<p><span>Battery lifetime depends on how often Emerald makes its measurements. If you choose to take measurements once per minute, the battery will last about 30 days on a single charge.</span> </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>How much space can one Emerald and Airadicate cover?</b></p>
<p><span>One Emerald and one Airadicate device can cover up to 270 square feet (25 square meters). Generally, one Emerald per room in your home is enough. Remember to place your Emerald at the height of 5.2-5.9ft (1.6-1.8m) in the rooms where you spend most of your time.</span><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Is Emerald Air waterproof?</b></p>
<p><span>Emerald Air was designed to enable good airflow to the sensors inside the casing, so it cannot be waterproof at the same time. Please keep it away from water or humid places.</span><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Is Emerald calibrated?</b></p>
<p><span>Each device will go through calibration and tests on our production line before it gets shipped to you.</span><br/></p>

A complete system that monitors and cleans the air around you to protect your family from sickness and discomfort.

 It not only detects all the harmful substances released from household finishing materials, human breathing and AC, but also filters up odors, smoke, PM2.5, VOCs and allergens. Thanks to UV LED disinfection technology it kills bacteria and viruses in the air you breathe.

Emerald
 Small but powerful.



                                           

 Emerald measures the most important air parameters which affect your health and comfort.




 Plus 4 other important features:




           









Mobile app



Emerald is connected to its own mobile app that displays all your air data in real-time.

     It will alarm you when any of the parameters is exceeded and help you be sure that the air your family breathes is always clean.    






Moreover, it will tell why you slept poorly or how to be more productive in the office.
 For more in-depth analysis, the Emerald App also shows you the air parameters from the last 24h and offers tips on how to improve your indoor environment. Simple, right?

     

Click here to test the app for free:

             https://itunes.apple.com/pl/app/emerald-air/id1...

Android app will be available in July.

    Quick check    


                                    


You don't need to have your mobile with you to check your air quality. You can always do a quick check by simply touching the device to find out if your home is safe.Green light indicates that everything is fine, while red alerts that something is not right.




 
Easy to install

 Using a special magnet sticker, easily install your Emerald in any room you want monitored. Select 1 of 8 room types and be sure that every room in your home is protected.

                 







Airadicate
The smart air purifier.

                

What’s smart about the Emerald Air system?An Emerald sensor alarm about your home’s low air quality automatically triggers the Airadicate purifier which then goes to work to filter up and eradicate airborne threats.



               

Unique technology

Airadicate kills all the viruses, bacteria and mold in the air with LED UV-C disinfection. It also filters up odors, smoke, PM2.5, VOCs, and allergens.









Airadicate has 3 built-in advanced composite filters which each providing 4-stage filtration: preliminary, anti-allergy, HEPA and carbon. The filters last up to 1 year so no need to worry about frequent changing. Replacements cost only about $20 and you can change them yourself, hassle free.   
           

Once the filtration process is done, the Airadicate purifier then goes to work on the viruses and bacteria in your home using our advanced LED UV-C disinfection technology.     Airadicate has a powerful built-in 120x120mm fan which delivers 150 m3/h of airflow. One device covers up to 25 square meters (270 square feet), about the size of an average room.

            
Why we created Emerald Air?


     

Every day, we take more than 20,000 breaths.
We spend up to 90% of our lives indoors, 
where the air can be 8 to 10 times more polluted than outside.
Today, more than 300 million people suffer from asthma or allergies.
 Air pollution is responsible for 5.5 million deaths around the world each year.
Now you have a weapon to protect your loved ones from indoor air pollution that causes asthma, allergies, sickness and discomfort.
              


Our Journey
 
Over the past year, our team has been working extremely hard interviewing customers, designing, prototyping, coding and testing. 





     After countless tests in our lab, 




we’ve built 7 prototypes as the final version of Emerald



and compared it to Tiger, a $7,000 VOC detector. As you can see below, the lines are directly correlated. 






    Thanks to our unique algorithms, Emerald is even 30% more sensitive to VOCs.  


                                               


Where are we now?

    We have recently completed the PVT (Production Validation Test), which involves manufacturing, assembling and testing. We've selected experienced manufacturing partners that have built and shipped millions of devices and are ready to do it again with Emerald.

 

Now we are ready to start mass production.    
 The only thing left is to raise our goal to get it going.


 Why Indiegogo?   



When building a product that addresses something as important as health, we didn't want to build it in silence, hidden away somewhere in a lab.


Your support will be the signal for us to go ahead with manufacturing and to start making your home a safer place, one Emerald Air at a time.

If any unexpected difficulties arise, we will be in the best position to remedy the situation, and of course, we will keep you informed.We really appreciate your support and can’t wait to get your Emerald Air systems to you!



FAQ



Who should buy Emerald Air?
It’s for anyone and everyone who cares about their health and well-being. We rarely realize how indoor air affects our health. Breathing in even small amounts of harmful substances causes headaches, lowers productivity, leads to asthma or allergies, and even increases the risk of cancer - and you don’t even know when it happens. That’s why we have created Emerald Air - to help you see what’s invisible and give you a chance to protect your family from sickness and discomfort.

Technical Questions

How small is Emerald and how much does it weigh?
Emerald measures 2.1x2.1x0.6 inch (55x55x15mm) and only weighs 3.45 ounces (98 grams).

What are the ambient operating conditions of Emerald?
The ambient temperature range is from 41°F (5°C) to 149°F (65°C), and the relative humidity range is from 0-95%.



How does Emerald measure air quality?
Emerald measures air pollution in real time, detecting a wide range of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). It alerts you when your home or office air becomes not safe.

How often does Emerald take an update its air measurements?
Emerald takes measurements of its environment once every minute when you are at home. When you’re out, Emerald does it every 15 minutes and then displays the results in a chart on the mobile app to give you the picture of the last 24 hours. But you can also choose a mode that on demand takes measurements every 3s.

Does Emerald have its dedicated mobile app?
Of course! We have created a mobile app for iOS 9+ and Android 4.3+ devices with Bluetooth Low Energy support. You can download it already from the App Store and Google Play

Is the Emerald Air mobile app free?
Absolutely! The Emerald Air app is free to use, and there are no additional subscriptions. We also provide free software updates, so that your Emeralds get even smarter over time.


How many Emeralds can you connect to the mobile app?
You can connect up to 5 emeralds to your mobile app.


Will the app also have the temperature in Fahrenheit, inHg for barometric pressure measurement and a 12-hour clock?

Yes, it can be configured to Celsius/Fahrenheit, hPa/inHg and a 12/24-hour clock.  

Will there be continued support/updates for the app?

Yes! We have a long roadmap for new features and are committed to perfecting the system. If you have any suggestions, please contact our team.

Do Emerald sensors require an Internet connection?
Emerald sensors can send your data directly to your iOS or Android smartphone via Bluetooth Low Energy, so you don’t need to be connected to the internet.

Can you use Emerald without a smartphone?
Yes, you can touch the Emerald logo on the case. The device will then do a quick measurement and light up green or red depending on the air quality. Green - everything is ok, but red means that something is wrong with your environment, and you need to consult your mobile app. The Airadicate purifier can work autonomously even without the app or the Emerald sensor.

Can you get phone alerts about your environment?
Yes, you receive notifications in the mobile app if a problem appears along with a description and tips & tricks on how to fix it in the easiest way.


Is Emerald powered by a battery?
Emerald has a built-in 1000 mAh rechargeable battery which you’ll need to recharge just a few times per year (depending on usage). You can recharge your Emerald with any standard certified micro-USB mobile charger that you use for your phone. A micro USB cable is also included with every product.

How long will the battery last?
Battery lifetime depends on how often Emerald makes its measurements. If you choose to take measurements once per minute, the battery will last about 30 days on a single charge. 

How much space can one Emerald and Airadicate cover?
One Emerald and one Airadicate device can cover up to 270 square feet (25 square meters). Generally, one Emerald per room in your home is enough. Remember to place your Emerald at the height of 5.2-5.9ft (1.6-1.8m) in the rooms where you spend most of your time.

Is Emerald Air waterproof?
Emerald Air was designed to enable good airflow to the sensors inside the casing, so it cannot be waterproof at the same time. Please keep it away from water or humid places.

Is Emerald calibrated?
Each device will go through calibration and tests on our production line before it gets shipped to you.

</b><p>Scopo del progetto
<i><b>madeincolours</b></i> è quello di coalizzare la piccola industria europea che “colora”
(tessile, concia, carta, legno, plastica...), il suo indotto (tessitura,
filatura, calzaturifici…) e il consumatore dell’articolo finale per attivare
tutti insieme una comunicazione capillare ed aggressiva volta a <b>far comprendere al maggior numero possibile
di persone le profonde differenze</b>, in termini di sicurezza per la salute e
tutela dell’ambiente, tra un prodotto fatto davvero da noi, sin dall’immissione
dei prodotti chimici, ed uno importato da fuori, con controlli decisamente
insufficienti. Questo per <b>spingere i
brand che commercializzano i prodotti finiti e la grande distribuzione, ad
utilizzare un’etichetta “trasparente” – <i>madeincolours</i>, appunto - che permetta di </b><b>tracciare i capi ed i prodotti davvero colorati in
Europa, consentendo al consumatore di effettuare una scelta informata su cosa
acquistare.</b></p>

<h2><b>Il problema della tracciabilità della colorazione industriale</b></h2>
</div>
<br/>
<b></b><p>L’Unione
Europea tutela i suoi cittadini tramite il Regolamento REACH: norme severissime
relative alle sostanze chimiche che salvaguardano la salute delle persone e dell’ambiente.
Siamo però garantiti solo per quei prodotti fatti davvero all’interno
dell’Unione Europea sin dalle prime fasi produttive, ovvero sin dall’immissione
dei coloranti chimici.<br/>
L’etichetta Made in Europe (Made in UK, Made in Italy, ecc…) garantisce
esclusivamente il fatto che le ultime fasi della produzione (gli assemblaggi
del prodotto) siano avvenute entro i confini UE, ma l’immissione di sostanze
chimiche, dei coloranti, avviene nelle prime fasi della filiera produttiva…
Quindi <b>la nostra maglietta Made in Italy
potrebbe essere stata colorata in Asia</b> e affatto sicura e controllata! <i>(</i><a href=""http://www.guidaconsumatore.com/consumo_consumatori/prodotti-cinesi-rischi-e-pericoli.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>http://www.guidaconsumatore.com/consumo_consumatori/prodotti-cinesi-rischi-e-pericoli.html</i></a><i> ) </i><b><span>Il problema per noi consumatori è sapere se il capo che stiamo
acquistando è stato interamente prodotto (quindi anche colorato) all’interno
dell’Unione Europea.</span></b> Nulla oggi nelle
etichettature esistenti ci dice dove è avvenuta la colorazione: <b>la normativa europea su questo aspetto è
totalmente assente.</b></p>

<p>Il
progetto che stiamo realizzando è una “etichetta parlante” che permetta di
tracciare i capi ed i prodotti davvero colorati all’interno dell’Unione Europea.
Un marchio di garanzia riconoscibile (<i><b>madeincolours</b></i>, appunto) che potrà essere
applicato a tutti i prodotti; <b>un’etichetta
abbinata ad un QR code grazie al quale, tramite smartphone, si potrà
immediatamente avere informazioni sul prodotto e la garanzia </b>che è stato
colorato all’interno della UE. Basterà quindi riconoscere il marchio <b><i>madeincolours</i></b>
per sapersi adeguatamente tutelati sulla effettiva provenienza del prodotto, a
partire dall’immissione di sostanze chimiche coloranti.</p>
<br/><br/>
<div style=""padding:5% 5% 3% 5%;border-left:3px solid #fbc505;"">
<h2><b>Per il consumatore, il diritto di scegliere.</b></h2>
</div>
<br/>
<p>Tutti
gli articoli colorati all’interno dell’Unione Europea - abbigliamento, arredamento,
accessori, imballi, prodotti di carta e cartone, legno, plastica -  devono
essere sicuri ed etici per legge ma, proprio per arrivare a garantire questo,
hanno inevitabilmente costi di produzione più alti rispetto a quelli dei Paesi
extra-europei che non devono rispondere alle stesse regolamentazioni imposte ai
nostri produttori (ad esempio il Regolamento REACH). <br/>
<b><i>Madeincolours
</i>è un progetto che difende e diffonde l’eccellenza del settore della
colorazione industriale in Europa, parlando direttamente al consumatore.</b></p>
<p>ll
marchio <b><i>madeincolours </i></b>significa “colorato all’interno dell’Unione Europea nel
rispetto delle normative vigenti” e trasferisce al consumatore finale che
quella certa filiera produttiva sta lavorando in modo virtuoso, minimizzando i
rischi e ottimizzando qualità e sicurezza, a partire dalla colorazione industriale.</p>
<p>L’etichetta <b><i>madeincolours</i></b>
dà senso e sostanza allo sforzo costante delle aziende europee nel migliorare
il prodotto perché sia sano e sicuro per l’uomo e l’ambiente.</p>
<br/><br/>
<div style=""padding:5% 5% 3% 5%;border-left:3px solid #063c85;"">
<h2>
<b>Perché un crowdfunding. <br/>
Un marchio di garanzia che può nascere solo dal basso.</b>
</h2>
</div>
<br/>
<p><b>Il progetto è dunque quello di spingere le aziende ad
effettuare la fase di colorazione industriale dei loro prodotti qui,
all’interno dell’Unione Europea e di rendere questo processo trasparente ai
consumatori tramite l’etichetta <i>madeincolours</i>,
che traccia la filiera produttiva sin dalle prime fasi di colorazione. </b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460409966/Link_ads_madeincolours_1200x627_bambino_ita_qmhima.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Ma questo a molte
aziende non piace. Infatti </span><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">è più redditizio
limitarsi ad assemblare in Europa i vari componenti</b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">, per proporci poi il
prodotto finito, etichettato Made in Europe.</span><br/></p>
<p>Quindi il nostro
problema è convincere le aziende a cambiare modello produttivo. Come fare?<br/>
<br/>
Prima di decidere di rivolgerci direttamente alle persone con una campagna di
crowdfunding, abbiamo tentato con la politica, le istituzioni, le Associazioni
Industriali e di Categoria, ma <b>ci siamo
scontrati con interessi che vanno in direzione opposta alla tutela del
consumatore:</b> <b>vantaggi economici
della delocalizzazione, maggiore marginalità dell’azienda sul prodotto,
rapporti politici con i Paesi in via di sviluppo…</b> Abbiamo capito che
l’unica possibilità per ottenere la tracciabilità del colore chimico è fare
salire questo bisogno dalla base: da noi, dai cittadini, dai consumatori.</p>
<p>Solo se noi
sceglieremo, se noi preferiremo i prodotti etichettati <b><i>madeincolours</i></b>,
riconoscendone la qualità e la sicurezza, le aziende per non perdere quote di
mercato dovranno decidersi a cambiare modello produttivo, garantendo che la
colorazione chimica dei loro prodotti avvenga all’interno della UE e
certificandola con <b><i>madeincolours</i></b>. <br/></p>
<p>Perché siamo noi quelli interessati alla salute,
alla tutela dell’ambiente e alla conservazione di buoni posti di lavoro in
territorio europeo, all’interno di aziende virtuose e all’avanguardia. <br/>
Noi siamo consumatori ed elettori, noi abbiamo la forza, e sempre più dobbiamo
imparare a coordinarci per usarla. <br/></p>

<div style=""padding:5% 5% 3% 5%;border-left:3px solid #46a12e;"">
<h2><b>A cosa servono i soldi che raccoglieremo.</b></h2>
</div>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>
<span></span>Abbiamo già
l’etichetta.</li>
<li>
<span></span>Abbiamo già il
software per la tracciatura. Siamo già in grado di dare il marchio e il QR a
tutte le aziende che producono secondo le regole e che li richiedono. </li>
<li>
<span></span><b>Adesso dobbiamo</b> <b>convincere i marchi</b> che commercializzano
i loro prodotti sul mercato ad indicare che l’immissione dei prodotti chimici è
avvenuta in UE a garanzia del cliente e della qualità del prodotto. Ma per fare
ciò la richiesta deve arrivare dai consumatori stessi.</li>
</ul>
<p><b></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460410012/Link_ads_madeincolours_1200x627_bosco_ita_hzfigl.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p><b>Quindi utilizzeremo i fondi raccolti
per attivare il seguente processo:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>
<b><span></span></b>tramite una
campagna di sensibilizzazione a livello europeo, spiegare ai consumatori gli
effetti della colorazione chimica senza controllo, così da <b>creare l’esigenza;</b>
</li>
<li>
<span></span>la conseguenza
sarà che i consumatori preferiranno acquistare prodotti garantiti
dall’etichetta <i><b>madeincolours</b></i>. Faremo cioè in modo di <b>creare la domanda</b>;</li>
<li>
<span></span>così le aziende,
per non perdere o per guadagnare quote di mercato, saranno spinte ad effettuare
la colorazione chimica in UE, così da poter esporre sui loro prodotti il marchio di
garanzia <i><b>madeincolours</b></i>: <b>creare il
cambiamento</b>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I
soldi che stiamo raccogliendo tramite il crowdfunding servono a finanziare una
campagna di sensibilizzazione informativa a livello europeo che raggiunga più
persone possibili.</p>
<p><b>La comunicazione e l’informazione oggi sono molto
costose, e sono nelle mani delle multinazionali e della grande distribuzione. </b>Noi veniamo informati da loro nelle nostre scelte
d’acquisto, che si basano su ciò che loro vogliono dirci.<br/>
<b>Per informare e comunicare allo stesso
loro livello, vogliamo farci finanziare dai consumatori</b>: i fondi ci
serviranno per finanziare una Campagna Informativa <b>nelle scuole, nelle università e tramite i social media</b>. L’oggetto
sarà spiegare rischi e conseguenze per la salute e per l’ambiente creati della
colorazione industriale non regolamentata dalle leggi europee e di <b>diffondere la richiesta di uno strumento di
tracciatura di queste sostanze</b>, per permettere di scegliere consapevolmente
cosa acquistare. <br/></p>

<h2><b>Chi siamo noi.</b></h2>
</div>
<br/>
<p>Il
progetto <b><i>madeincolours</i></b> nasce dalla lunga esperienze della sua titolare, Michela
Kahlberg, nel mondo della colorazione industriale. Dopo anni di attività
commerciale con i coloranti ed i pigmenti organici infatti, con l’entrata in
vigore del Regolamento REACH nel 2007, Michela Kahlberg fonda la
REACH&amp;Colours Italia, società di consulenza (regulatory) specializzata
nello studio dei coloranti organici. Oggi REACH&amp;Colours Italia è il manager
tecnico ed amministrativo dei tre Consorzi Europei REACH Coloranti che <span>stanno facendo tutte le analisi
chimiche, tossicologiche ed eco-tossicologiche sui coloranti organici, finalizzando
tutti i dossier e le registrazioni REACH di queste sostanze<i>.</i></span></p>
<p>Il
Regolamento REACH è infatti una normativa europea severissima che obbliga
l’industria italiana ed europea ad andare veramente a fondo nell’analisi di
tutte le sostanze chimiche usate all’interno della UE: non solo analizzare e
classificare ogni sostanza chimica, ma definire anche come e dove può essere
usata.</p>
<p>Dopo
sei anni di intenso lavoro e importanti investimenti nella ricerca chimica sui
coloranti, valutata in concreto anche l’importanza del lavoro che si sta
facendo per l’effettiva tutela della salute e dell’ambiente, nel 2014 la
dottoressa Kahlberg fonda la società <b><i>madeincolours</i> </b>con lo scopo di dare visibilità
all’opinione pubblica su quanto si sta facendo all’interno dell’UE e cercare di
ottenere trasparenza da parte di tutte quelle aziende che vendono i loro
prodotti sul mercato.</p>

a occuparsi della divulgazione di informazioni relative alla salute, alla

agli europei le tante nostre eccellenze che stanno all’inizio della filiera

<p>Our clothes,
our children T-shirts, leather goods, furnishings, the paper napkins we use to
clean our mouths... most of the products we use every day are coloured
chemically.</p>
<p>As shown by
research carried out by independent research institutes <b>a high percentage of the products which come from non-European

<p>The aromatic amines are carcinogenic, for
example, and many other molecules are dangerous: formaldehyde, or chloro dioxins,
to mention just a few. </p>
<p>These <b>substances are severely controlled and

the water and the different organisms.</p>
<p>In fact it is
impossible to check with the same attention and severity everything that is
imported from outside the EU. Rules and standards can be laid down for
non-European manufacturers, samples can be tested, but <b>if the chemical products are used outside the European Union it is

</b><p>The purpose of the <i><b>madeincolours</b></i> project is to gather the
small European companies which “colour” (textiles, leather, paper, wood,
plastic...), their downstream companies (clothing, yarn and shoe factories,
etc.… ) and the consumer of the final article, as to start, all together, to
spread a capillary and aggressive message aimed at <b>making aware as many people as possible about the great differences</b>,
in terms of safety for health and for environmental protection, between a
product really made in Europe, right from the steps involving the use of
chemical products, and a product imported from outside Europe, where controls
are decidedly insufficient. The scope is <b>to
convince the brands, which sell the finished products, and the retails and
stores to use a “transparent” label – namely the <i>madeincolours</i> label – which
allows for</b><b>tracing the garments and products
really coloured in Europe, allowing the consumer to choose consciously what to
buy.</b></p>

<h2><b>The industrial colouring traceability.</b></h2>
</div>
<br/>
<p>The European
Union protects its citizens by means of the REACH Regulation: a series of
extremely severe rules on chemical substances, to safeguard human health and
the environment. But we are only guaranteed for those products that are really
made in the European Union right from the first production steps, i.e. from the
dyeing process with the use of chemical colourants.<span>The
Made in Europe (Made in UK, Made in Italy, etc…) label guarantees only the fact
that the last production steps (the assembly of the product) have been carried
out inside the EU, but the chemical substances, the chemical colourants, are used
in the manufacturing of the product from the very first steps of the production
chain… Therefore <b>our Made in Italy
T-shirt could have been dyed in Asia</b> and may be anything but safe and
controlled! </span><i><b>The problem
for us, the consumers, is that of knowing whether the garment we buy has been
entirely produced (and therefore also dyed) in the European Union.</b>
Today nothing on the existing labels tells us where the article was coloured: <b>on this aspect, European legislation is
totally absent.</b></i></p>

<p>The project we
are carrying out is for a “speaking label” which allows for the tracing of
garments and products that have really been coloured inside the European Union.
A recognisable hallmark/brand (the <i><b>madeincolours</b></i> mark) that can be applied to
all products; <b>a label connected to a QR
code, that can be read by the consumer smartphone, which obtains information on
the product and the guarantee </b>that it has been coloured inside the EU.
Thus, it will be enough to recognise the <b><i>madeincolours</i></b> label to know that you
are adequately protected in respect of the effective origin of the products,
going right back to the production step involving the use of chemical
colourants.</p>
<br/><br/>
<div style=""padding:5% 5% 3% 5%;border-left:3px solid #fbc505;"">
<h2><b>For the consumer, the
right to choose.</b></h2>
</div>
<br/>
<p>For all
articles coloured inside the European Union – clothing, furnishings,
accessories, packaging, and products made of paper and cardboard, wood, plastic
– the law obliges conformity with standards of safety and ethics but, as to
guarantee this compliance, the production costs are inevitably higher than
those of non-European countries, which do not have to comply with the same
rules required on our manufacturers (such as the REACH Regulation). <b><i><span>Madeincolours
</span></i></b><b>is a project
which defends and makes known the excellence of the industrial colouring sector
in Europe, speaking directly to the consumer.</b></p>
<p>The <b><i>madeincolours
</i></b>mark means “coloured inside the European Union in respect of the laws
in force” and it informs the consumer that the production chain in question is
working in a virtuous manner, minimising risks and optimising quality and
safety, starting right from the industrial colouring stage.</p>
<p>The <b><i>madeincolours</i></b> label gives sense and
substance to the constant effort of European companies to improve their products
so that they are healthy and safe for man and for the environment.</p>
<br/><br/>
<div style=""padding:5% 5% 3% 5%;border-left:3px solid #063c85;"">
<h2>
<b>Why a crowdfunding? </b><b><b>This hallmark can only be created by consumers!<br/></b></b>
</h2>
</div>
<br/>
<p><b>The
project is therefore to persuade companies to carry out the industrial
colouring steps of their products here, inside the European Union, and
to make this process known to consumers by means of the <i>madeincolours</i> label which traces the production chain right down to
the first steps involving colouring. </b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460409308/Link_ads_madeincolours_1200x627_bambino_eng_tvst23.png"" src="""" style=""""/></b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>But many companies do not like this idea. In fact <b>it is more profitable to merely assemble
the various components in Europe</b>, and then present the finished product
labelled Made in Europe.</p>
<p>Therefore our problem is to convince companies to change
their production model. <br/></p>
<p>What to do?<br/>
<span>Before
deciding to directly address people with a crowdfunding campaign, we tried with
politics, the institutions, the industrial associations and the category
associations but <b>we came up against
interests which went in the opposite direction to that of consumer protection:</b>
<b>economic advantages of de-localisation,
higher profit margins for the company, political relations with developing
countries…</b> We understood that the only chance of obtaining the traceability
of chemical colouring is to make this need coming from the base: from us, from
citizens, from consumers.</span></p>
<p>Only if we choose, if we prefer, products labelled <b><i>madeincolours</i></b>,
recognising the quality and the safety, companies will have to decide to change
their production model, to avoid losing market shares, and guarantee that the
chemical colouring of their products takes place inside the EU, certifying it with
<b><i>madeincolours</i></b>.
Since we are the people interested in health, in protecting the environment,
and in keeping jobs in Europe, in virtuous avant-garde companies. <span>We
are consumers and voters, we have the strength, and we must continuously learn
how to work together in order to use that strength. <br/></span></p>
<br/><br/>
<div style=""padding:5% 5% 3% 5%;border-left:3px solid #46a12e;"">
<h2><b>What the money we raise is used for.</b></h2>
</div>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>
<span></span>We already have the label.</li>
<li>
<span></span>We already have the software for
tracing it. We are already able to give the mark and the QR to all the
companies that produce according to the rules and which request the mark. </li>
<li>
<span></span><b>Now
we must</b> <b>convince the brands</b>
which sell their products on the market to indicate that the chemical colouring
has taken place in the EU in order to guarantee the customer of the quality of
the product. But as to do this, the request must come from the consumers
themselves.</li>
</ul>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460409357/Link_ads_madeincolours_1200x627_bosco_eng_cftjjz.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<p><b>Therefore
we will use the raised funds to carry out the following process:</b></p>
<p><b>1.<span> 
</span></b>An awareness campaign at European
level to explain to the consumers the effects of uncontrolled chemical
colouring, thus <b>the need will be created;</b></p>
<p><b>2.</b><span> 
</span>the consequence will be that consumers
will prefer to buy products guaranteed by the <i><b>madeincolours</b></i> label, i.e. <b>the demand will be created</b>;</p>
<p><b>3.</b><span><b> </b>
</span>thus, the companies, to avoid losing
or to gain market shares, will be persuaded to carry out the chemical colouring
in the EU in order to be able to display the <i><b>madeincolours</b></i> hallmark on their
products: <b>the change will be created</b>.</p>
<p>The money we have
been raising by crowd funding serves to finance an informative awareness
campaign at European level, which will reach as many people as possible.</p>
<p><b>Today,
communication and information are very expensive, and they are in the hands of
the multinationals and the huge retail and store chains. </b>They
tell us what to buy, and our choice is influenced by what they want us to know.<b><span>We want to
inform and communicate at their same level, but financed by consumers</span></b>:
the funds will be used to finance an Information Campaign <b>in schools, in universities and through the social media</b>. The purpose
will be to explain the risks and consequences for health and for the
environment resulting from industrial colouring that is not regulated by the
European laws, and <b>to spread the request
for a tool for tracing these substances</b>, to allow consumers to make an
informed choice when making their purchases. <br/></p>

<h2><b>Who we are.</b></h2>
</div>
<br/>
<p>The <b><i>madeincolours</i></b>
project was conceived by Michela Kahlberg due to her long experience in the
world of industrial colouring. In fact, after years of commercial activity with
colourants and organic pigments, and with the entry into force of the REACH
Regulation in 2007, Michela Kahlberg founded REACH&amp;Colours Italia, an consulting
company (regulatory) specialised in the study of organic colourants. Today
REACH&amp;Colours Italia is the technical and administrative manager of the
three European REACH Dyes Consortia which carry out all the chemical,
toxicological and eco-toxicological analyses on the organic colourants,
finalising all the reports and the REACH registrations of these substances<i>.</i></p>
<p>The REACH
regulation is, in fact, an extremely severe European regulation which obliges Italian
and European industries to thoroughly analyse in great depth all the chemical
substances used inside the EU: not only analysing and classifying every
chemical substance, but also defining how and where it can be used.</p>
<p>After six
years of intense work and important investments in chemical research in
colourants, having also concretely assessed the importance of the work being
carried out for the effective protection of health and of the environment, in
2014 Dr. Kahlberg founded the <i><b>madeincolours
</b></i>company with the purpose of giving visibility to public opinion on what is
being carried out inside the EU and to attempt to obtain transparency on the
part of all those companies who sell their products on the market.</p>

<h2><b>The companies associated with <i>madeincolours</i>.</b></h2>
</div>
<br/>
<p>The companies associated with <i><b>madeincolours</b></i>, those at the
start of the production chain, which colour our products, are <b>European manufacturers which work ethically
and with professional pride, which respect the law at the cost of great effort

Un marchio di garanzia per il consumatore finale, che ci tuteli dalla colorazione chimica industriale.



 

I nostri vestiti, le magliette dei nostri bambini, la pelletteria, l’arredamento, i tovagliolini di carta che utilizziamo per pulirci la bocca… la maggior parte dei prodotti che usiamo ogni giorno sono colorati chimicamente.Come
dimostrato da ricerche svolte da Istituti di Ricerca indipendenti,
una grande percentuale dei prodotti che
arrivano da Paesi extra-europei contiene sostanze chimiche tossiche, pericolose
per l’uomo e per l’ambiente, che possono derivare da una colorazione non
controllata.


Le ammine aromatiche sono cancerogene ad esempio, come sono pericolose
molte altre molecole: la formaldeide, la benzidina, la tetraclorodiossina, per
dirne alcune. 
Si
tratta di sostanze severamente
controllate e normate nella colorazione industriale all’interno dell’Unione
Europea, che possono avere conseguenze importanti sulla salute delle persone,
quali sensibilizzazioni, allergie, problemi di fertilità e di riproduzione…fino
al cancro. E sull’ambiente, inquinando le acque e la vegetazione.
È
di fatto impossibile controllare con la stessa nostra attenzione e severità
tutto ciò che viene importato da fuori UE. Si possono dare regole, capitolati
ai produttori extra-europei, fare qualche test a campione ma, se i prodotti chimici vengono immessi al di
fuori dell’Unione Europea, un controllo ad alto livello tecnico, soprattutto
relativo alla pericolosità intrinseca di alcune sostanze, è pressoché
irrealizzabile. 


Scopo del progetto
madeincolours è quello di coalizzare la piccola industria europea che “colora”
(tessile, concia, carta, legno, plastica...), il suo indotto (tessitura,
filatura, calzaturifici…) e il consumatore dell’articolo finale per attivare
tutti insieme una comunicazione capillare ed aggressiva volta a far comprendere al maggior numero possibile
di persone le profonde differenze, in termini di sicurezza per la salute e
tutela dell’ambiente, tra un prodotto fatto davvero da noi, sin dall’immissione
dei prodotti chimici, ed uno importato da fuori, con controlli decisamente
insufficienti. Questo per spingere i
brand che commercializzano i prodotti finiti e la grande distribuzione, ad
utilizzare un’etichetta “trasparente” – madeincolours, appunto - che permetta di tracciare i capi ed i prodotti davvero colorati in
Europa, consentendo al consumatore di effettuare una scelta informata su cosa
acquistare.



Il problema della tracciabilità della colorazione industriale


L’Unione
Europea tutela i suoi cittadini tramite il Regolamento REACH: norme severissime
relative alle sostanze chimiche che salvaguardano la salute delle persone e dell’ambiente.
Siamo però garantiti solo per quei prodotti fatti davvero all’interno
dell’Unione Europea sin dalle prime fasi produttive, ovvero sin dall’immissione
dei coloranti chimici.
L’etichetta Made in Europe (Made in UK, Made in Italy, ecc…) garantisce
esclusivamente il fatto che le ultime fasi della produzione (gli assemblaggi
del prodotto) siano avvenute entro i confini UE, ma l’immissione di sostanze
chimiche, dei coloranti, avviene nelle prime fasi della filiera produttiva…
Quindi la nostra maglietta Made in Italy
potrebbe essere stata colorata in Asia e affatto sicura e controllata! (http://www.guidaconsumatore.com/consumo_consumatori/prodotti-cinesi-rischi-e-pericoli.html ) Il problema per noi consumatori è sapere se il capo che stiamo
acquistando è stato interamente prodotto (quindi anche colorato) all’interno
dell’Unione Europea. Nulla oggi nelle
etichettature esistenti ci dice dove è avvenuta la colorazione: la normativa europea su questo aspetto è
totalmente assente.





Madeincolours. L’etichetta europea che traccia il colore sano.






Il
progetto che stiamo realizzando è una “etichetta parlante” che permetta di
tracciare i capi ed i prodotti davvero colorati all’interno dell’Unione Europea.
Un marchio di garanzia riconoscibile (madeincolours, appunto) che potrà essere
applicato a tutti i prodotti; un’etichetta
abbinata ad un QR code grazie al quale, tramite smartphone, si potrà
immediatamente avere informazioni sul prodotto e la garanzia che è stato
colorato all’interno della UE. Basterà quindi riconoscere il marchio madeincolours
per sapersi adeguatamente tutelati sulla effettiva provenienza del prodotto, a
partire dall’immissione di sostanze chimiche coloranti.


Per il consumatore, il diritto di scegliere.


Tutti
gli articoli colorati all’interno dell’Unione Europea - abbigliamento, arredamento,
accessori, imballi, prodotti di carta e cartone, legno, plastica -  devono
essere sicuri ed etici per legge ma, proprio per arrivare a garantire questo,
hanno inevitabilmente costi di produzione più alti rispetto a quelli dei Paesi
extra-europei che non devono rispondere alle stesse regolamentazioni imposte ai
nostri produttori (ad esempio il Regolamento REACH). 
Madeincolours
è un progetto che difende e diffonde l’eccellenza del settore della
colorazione industriale in Europa, parlando direttamente al consumatore.
ll
marchio madeincolours significa “colorato all’interno dell’Unione Europea nel
rispetto delle normative vigenti” e trasferisce al consumatore finale che
quella certa filiera produttiva sta lavorando in modo virtuoso, minimizzando i
rischi e ottimizzando qualità e sicurezza, a partire dalla colorazione industriale.
L’etichetta madeincolours
dà senso e sostanza allo sforzo costante delle aziende europee nel migliorare
il prodotto perché sia sano e sicuro per l’uomo e l’ambiente.



Perché un crowdfunding. 
Un marchio di garanzia che può nascere solo dal basso.



Il progetto è dunque quello di spingere le aziende ad
effettuare la fase di colorazione industriale dei loro prodotti qui,
all’interno dell’Unione Europea e di rendere questo processo trasparente ai
consumatori tramite l’etichetta madeincolours,
che traccia la filiera produttiva sin dalle prime fasi di colorazione. 


Ma questo a molte
aziende non piace. Infatti è più redditizio
limitarsi ad assemblare in Europa i vari componenti, per proporci poi il
prodotto finito, etichettato Made in Europe.
Quindi il nostro
problema è convincere le aziende a cambiare modello produttivo. Come fare?

Prima di decidere di rivolgerci direttamente alle persone con una campagna di
crowdfunding, abbiamo tentato con la politica, le istituzioni, le Associazioni
Industriali e di Categoria, ma ci siamo
scontrati con interessi che vanno in direzione opposta alla tutela del
consumatore: vantaggi economici
della delocalizzazione, maggiore marginalità dell’azienda sul prodotto,
rapporti politici con i Paesi in via di sviluppo… Abbiamo capito che
l’unica possibilità per ottenere la tracciabilità del colore chimico è fare
salire questo bisogno dalla base: da noi, dai cittadini, dai consumatori.
Solo se noi
sceglieremo, se noi preferiremo i prodotti etichettati madeincolours,
riconoscendone la qualità e la sicurezza, le aziende per non perdere quote di
mercato dovranno decidersi a cambiare modello produttivo, garantendo che la
colorazione chimica dei loro prodotti avvenga all’interno della UE e
certificandola con madeincolours. 
Perché siamo noi quelli interessati alla salute,
alla tutela dell’ambiente e alla conservazione di buoni posti di lavoro in
territorio europeo, all’interno di aziende virtuose e all’avanguardia. 
Noi siamo consumatori ed elettori, noi abbiamo la forza, e sempre più dobbiamo
imparare a coordinarci per usarla. 


A cosa servono i soldi che raccoglieremo.




Abbiamo già
l’etichetta.

Abbiamo già il
software per la tracciatura. Siamo già in grado di dare il marchio e il QR a
tutte le aziende che producono secondo le regole e che li richiedono. 

Adesso dobbiamo convincere i marchi che commercializzano
i loro prodotti sul mercato ad indicare che l’immissione dei prodotti chimici è
avvenuta in UE a garanzia del cliente e della qualità del prodotto. Ma per fare
ciò la richiesta deve arrivare dai consumatori stessi.





Quindi utilizzeremo i fondi raccolti
per attivare il seguente processo:


tramite una
campagna di sensibilizzazione a livello europeo, spiegare ai consumatori gli
effetti della colorazione chimica senza controllo, così da creare l’esigenza;


la conseguenza
sarà che i consumatori preferiranno acquistare prodotti garantiti
dall’etichetta madeincolours. Faremo cioè in modo di creare la domanda;

così le aziende,
per non perdere o per guadagnare quote di mercato, saranno spinte ad effettuare
la colorazione chimica in UE, così da poter esporre sui loro prodotti il marchio di
garanzia madeincolours: creare il
cambiamento.

I
soldi che stiamo raccogliendo tramite il crowdfunding servono a finanziare una
campagna di sensibilizzazione informativa a livello europeo che raggiunga più
persone possibili.
La comunicazione e l’informazione oggi sono molto
costose, e sono nelle mani delle multinazionali e della grande distribuzione. Noi veniamo informati da loro nelle nostre scelte
d’acquisto, che si basano su ciò che loro vogliono dirci.
Per informare e comunicare allo stesso
loro livello, vogliamo farci finanziare dai consumatori: i fondi ci
serviranno per finanziare una Campagna Informativa nelle scuole, nelle università e tramite i social media. L’oggetto
sarà spiegare rischi e conseguenze per la salute e per l’ambiente creati della
colorazione industriale non regolamentata dalle leggi europee e di diffondere la richiesta di uno strumento di
tracciatura di queste sostanze, per permettere di scegliere consapevolmente
cosa acquistare. 


Dove ci proponiamo di arrivare.






Tutti insieme possiamo farcela!


Supportateci per favore: da soli non
possiamo farcela. Pochi euro per
tante persone fanno la differenza. E vi
preghiamo di farlo subito. Se no, semplicemente, in mezzo a tutte le cose di ogni
giorno, questa sarà dimenticata.
Donate
quanto potete. È per la salute di tutti noi.
Vi
offriamo un piccolo regalo che non ha costi (perché tutti i soldi che
raccogliamo servono a far decollare il progetto!) e che è uguale per tutti,
perché tutti danno quanto ritengono di potersi permettere. 


Un piccolo regalo.

Chi siamo noi.


Il
progetto madeincolours nasce dalla lunga esperienze della sua titolare, Michela
Kahlberg, nel mondo della colorazione industriale. Dopo anni di attività
commerciale con i coloranti ed i pigmenti organici infatti, con l’entrata in
vigore del Regolamento REACH nel 2007, Michela Kahlberg fonda la
REACH&Colours Italia, società di consulenza (regulatory) specializzata
nello studio dei coloranti organici. Oggi REACH&Colours Italia è il manager
tecnico ed amministrativo dei tre Consorzi Europei REACH Coloranti che stanno facendo tutte le analisi
chimiche, tossicologiche ed eco-tossicologiche sui coloranti organici, finalizzando
tutti i dossier e le registrazioni REACH di queste sostanze.
Il
Regolamento REACH è infatti una normativa europea severissima che obbliga
l’industria italiana ed europea ad andare veramente a fondo nell’analisi di
tutte le sostanze chimiche usate all’interno della UE: non solo analizzare e
classificare ogni sostanza chimica, ma definire anche come e dove può essere
usata.
Dopo
sei anni di intenso lavoro e importanti investimenti nella ricerca chimica sui
coloranti, valutata in concreto anche l’importanza del lavoro che si sta
facendo per l’effettiva tutela della salute e dell’ambiente, nel 2014 la
dottoressa Kahlberg fonda la società madeincolours con lo scopo di dare visibilità
all’opinione pubblica su quanto si sta facendo all’interno dell’UE e cercare di
ottenere trasparenza da parte di tutte quelle aziende che vendono i loro
prodotti sul mercato.


Le aziende associate a madeincolours.


Le aziende associate
a madeincolours, quelle all’inizio della filiera produttiva, che colorano i
nostri prodotti, sono realtà produttive
europee che lavorano in modo etico e con orgoglio professionale, che rispettano
le normative con non pochi sforzi di tempo e d’investimenti. Quasi sempre
sono aziende sconosciute al pubblico perché, trovandosi agli inizi della
filiera, non comunicano con i clienti finali, ma sono quelle che ci garantiscono
gli standard di sicurezza del prodotto acquistato.
Oltre
a occuparsi della divulgazione di informazioni relative alla salute, alla
sicurezza e all’ambiente, madeincolours vorrebbe far conoscere
agli europei le tante nostre eccellenze che stanno all’inizio della filiera
produttiva. Sottolineare che grazie alle industrie manifatturiere possiamo
creare nuovi posti di lavoro invece che continuare a perderli, possiamo rilanciare
la nostra economia, quindi i nostri consumi, il tutto tutelando davvero
l’utilizzatore finale ed a prezzi comunque molto competitivi, perché non sono i nostri artigiani a far lievitare
i prezzi dei prodotti finiti bensì gl’incredibili ricarichi dei brand che li
firmano e commercializzano.



Timeline





Contiamo dunque, col
vostro aiuto e la vostra forza, di riuscire far partire al più presto le prime
etichettature, che arrivino finalmente sugli scaffali, direttamente al
consumatore finale. Noi siamo pronti, ora dobbiamo convincere l’industria e il
commercio a collaborare e a dare ai prodotti che tutti noi acquistiamo
trasparenza e tracciabilità!

A hallmark for the consumer, to protect us from industrial chemical colouring.



Our clothes,
our children T-shirts, leather goods, furnishings, the paper napkins we use to
clean our mouths... most of the products we use every day are coloured
chemically.
As shown by
research carried out by independent research institutes a high percentage of the products which come from non-European
countries contain toxic chemical substances, dangerous for man and for the
environment, which can come from uncontrolled colouring. 




The aromatic amines are carcinogenic, for
example, and many other molecules are dangerous: formaldehyde, or chloro dioxins,
to mention just a few. 
These substances are severely controlled and
regulated in industrial colouring in the European Union, since they can have
important consequences on human health, such as allergies, fertility and
reproduction problems... up to cancer. And on the environment, polluting
the water and the different organisms.
In fact it is
impossible to check with the same attention and severity everything that is
imported from outside the EU. Rules and standards can be laid down for
non-European manufacturers, samples can be tested, but if the chemical products are used outside the European Union it is
practically impossible to carry out checks at a high technical level,
especially on the intrinsic danger of certain substances. 





The purpose of the madeincolours project is to gather the
small European companies which “colour” (textiles, leather, paper, wood,
plastic...), their downstream companies (clothing, yarn and shoe factories,
etc.… ) and the consumer of the final article, as to start, all together, to
spread a capillary and aggressive message aimed at making aware as many people as possible about the great differences,
in terms of safety for health and for environmental protection, between a
product really made in Europe, right from the steps involving the use of
chemical products, and a product imported from outside Europe, where controls
are decidedly insufficient. The scope is to
convince the brands, which sell the finished products, and the retails and
stores to use a “transparent” label – namely the madeincolours label – which
allows fortracing the garments and products
really coloured in Europe, allowing the consumer to choose consciously what to
buy.



The industrial colouring traceability.


The European
Union protects its citizens by means of the REACH Regulation: a series of
extremely severe rules on chemical substances, to safeguard human health and
the environment. But we are only guaranteed for those products that are really
made in the European Union right from the first production steps, i.e. from the
dyeing process with the use of chemical colourants.The
Made in Europe (Made in UK, Made in Italy, etc…) label guarantees only the fact
that the last production steps (the assembly of the product) have been carried
out inside the EU, but the chemical substances, the chemical colourants, are used
in the manufacturing of the product from the very first steps of the production
chain… Therefore our Made in Italy
T-shirt could have been dyed in Asia and may be anything but safe and
controlled! The problem
for us, the consumers, is that of knowing whether the garment we buy has been
entirely produced (and therefore also dyed) in the European Union.
Today nothing on the existing labels tells us where the article was coloured: on this aspect, European legislation is
totally absent.





Madeincolours. The European label which traces healthy colours.






The project we
are carrying out is for a “speaking label” which allows for the tracing of
garments and products that have really been coloured inside the European Union.
A recognisable hallmark/brand (the madeincolours mark) that can be applied to
all products; a label connected to a QR
code, that can be read by the consumer smartphone, which obtains information on
the product and the guarantee that it has been coloured inside the EU.
Thus, it will be enough to recognise the madeincolours label to know that you
are adequately protected in respect of the effective origin of the products,
going right back to the production step involving the use of chemical
colourants.


For the consumer, the
right to choose.


For all
articles coloured inside the European Union – clothing, furnishings,
accessories, packaging, and products made of paper and cardboard, wood, plastic
– the law obliges conformity with standards of safety and ethics but, as to
guarantee this compliance, the production costs are inevitably higher than
those of non-European countries, which do not have to comply with the same
rules required on our manufacturers (such as the REACH Regulation). Madeincolours
is a project
which defends and makes known the excellence of the industrial colouring sector
in Europe, speaking directly to the consumer.
The madeincolours
mark means “coloured inside the European Union in respect of the laws
in force” and it informs the consumer that the production chain in question is
working in a virtuous manner, minimising risks and optimising quality and
safety, starting right from the industrial colouring stage.
The madeincolours label gives sense and
substance to the constant effort of European companies to improve their products
so that they are healthy and safe for man and for the environment.



Why a crowdfunding? This hallmark can only be created by consumers!



The
project is therefore to persuade companies to carry out the industrial
colouring steps of their products here, inside the European Union, and
to make this process known to consumers by means of the madeincolours label which traces the production chain right down to
the first steps involving colouring. 



But many companies do not like this idea. In fact it is more profitable to merely assemble
the various components in Europe, and then present the finished product
labelled Made in Europe.
Therefore our problem is to convince companies to change
their production model. 
What to do?
Before
deciding to directly address people with a crowdfunding campaign, we tried with
politics, the institutions, the industrial associations and the category
associations but we came up against
interests which went in the opposite direction to that of consumer protection:
economic advantages of de-localisation,
higher profit margins for the company, political relations with developing
countries… We understood that the only chance of obtaining the traceability
of chemical colouring is to make this need coming from the base: from us, from
citizens, from consumers.
Only if we choose, if we prefer, products labelled madeincolours,
recognising the quality and the safety, companies will have to decide to change
their production model, to avoid losing market shares, and guarantee that the
chemical colouring of their products takes place inside the EU, certifying it with
madeincolours.
Since we are the people interested in health, in protecting the environment,
and in keeping jobs in Europe, in virtuous avant-garde companies. We
are consumers and voters, we have the strength, and we must continuously learn
how to work together in order to use that strength. 


What the money we raise is used for.




We already have the label.

We already have the software for
tracing it. We are already able to give the mark and the QR to all the
companies that produce according to the rules and which request the mark. 

Now
we must convince the brands
which sell their products on the market to indicate that the chemical colouring
has taken place in the EU in order to guarantee the customer of the quality of
the product. But as to do this, the request must come from the consumers
themselves.


Therefore
we will use the raised funds to carry out the following process:
1. 
An awareness campaign at European
level to explain to the consumers the effects of uncontrolled chemical
colouring, thus the need will be created;
2. 
the consequence will be that consumers
will prefer to buy products guaranteed by the madeincolours label, i.e. the demand will be created;
3. 
thus, the companies, to avoid losing
or to gain market shares, will be persuaded to carry out the chemical colouring
in the EU in order to be able to display the madeincolours hallmark on their
products: the change will be created.
The money we have
been raising by crowd funding serves to finance an informative awareness
campaign at European level, which will reach as many people as possible.
Today,
communication and information are very expensive, and they are in the hands of
the multinationals and the huge retail and store chains. They
tell us what to buy, and our choice is influenced by what they want us to know.We want to
inform and communicate at their same level, but financed by consumers:
the funds will be used to finance an Information Campaign in schools, in universities and through the social media. The purpose
will be to explain the risks and consequences for health and for the
environment resulting from industrial colouring that is not regulated by the
European laws, and to spread the request
for a tool for tracing these substances, to allow consumers to make an
informed choice when making their purchases. 


What we want to achieve.





All together, we can
succeed!


Please
give us your support: we cannot do it alone. A few Euros
from a lot of people makes the difference. And
please, do it now. Otherwise, in the midst of all your everyday concerns, this
will be simply forgotten.
Give as much as
you can. It is for the health of all of us.
We offer you a
small gift, which has no cost (because all the money we raise is used to launch
the project!) and which is the same for everyone, because everyone gives as
much as he/she feels he/she can afford. 


A small gift :)

Who we are.


The madeincolours
project was conceived by Michela Kahlberg due to her long experience in the
world of industrial colouring. In fact, after years of commercial activity with
colourants and organic pigments, and with the entry into force of the REACH
Regulation in 2007, Michela Kahlberg founded REACH&Colours Italia, an consulting
company (regulatory) specialised in the study of organic colourants. Today
REACH&Colours Italia is the technical and administrative manager of the
three European REACH Dyes Consortia which carry out all the chemical,
toxicological and eco-toxicological analyses on the organic colourants,
finalising all the reports and the REACH registrations of these substances.
The REACH
regulation is, in fact, an extremely severe European regulation which obliges Italian
and European industries to thoroughly analyse in great depth all the chemical
substances used inside the EU: not only analysing and classifying every
chemical substance, but also defining how and where it can be used.
After six
years of intense work and important investments in chemical research in
colourants, having also concretely assessed the importance of the work being
carried out for the effective protection of health and of the environment, in
2014 Dr. Kahlberg founded the madeincolours
company with the purpose of giving visibility to public opinion on what is
being carried out inside the EU and to attempt to obtain transparency on the
part of all those companies who sell their products on the market.


The companies associated with madeincolours.


The companies associated with madeincolours, those at the
start of the production chain, which colour our products, are European manufacturers which work ethically
and with professional pride, which respect the law at the cost of great effort
also in terms of time and investments. They are almost always companies
unknown to the public because, being at the start of the production chain, they
do not communicate with the consumers, but they are the companies that
guarantee the safety standards of the products we buy.
In addition to
make known information on health, safety and the environment, madeincolours
would like to inform the general public about the many instances of excellence
positioned at the start of the production chain. To underline that thanks to
the manufacturing industries we can create new jobs instead of continuously
losing them, we can re-launch our economy, therefore our consumer goods, giving
real protection to the end user and at prices that are, in any case, very
competitive, because the price increases
of finished products are not caused by our manufacturing industries but by the
incredible profit margins of the brand names under which they are sold.

<div>And another plus: MeatMen is good for people with food intolerance. You are in control of everything you add  to your Bratwurst.

With MeatMen it'll be so easy - just follow these simple instructions and your own created Bratwurst will soon be on your BBQ. 
</div>
<div><i>Step 1.</i></div>
<div>Put the MeatMen meat filler on a firm footing.</div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436466610/arkksfnlena2bk1qphc6.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<i>Step 2.</i>
</div>
<div>You need to insert (at least) some water, edible oil and of course fresh minced pork meat - we prefer our local butchery to ensure freshness, purity, and fair trade. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Feel free to add anything that could be a good fit in a Bratwurst.</span>
</div>
<div>
<p></p>

<i>Step 3.</i><p>Yeah - it's spicy time... We really put the best and most delicious herbs and spices together. And believe us, we are experts! We will add two different blend of spices into our boxes - Original Rostbratwurst and Berlin Currywurst. In the future we will design more of those mixed spices and our German Bratwurst will become an international affair on BBQs' around the world. All our blends of spices are free of gluten, glutamate, and lactose. </p>

<i>Step 4.</i>
</div>
<div>Come on and stir it <strike>up</strike>... put the mixture in your kitchen aid or use your mixer. Wait until you get a viscid melange. </div>

<i>Step 6.</i>
</div>
<div>We will add sausage casing in our MeatMen box. No trouble with perishableness - you can take a natural collagen casing for the Bratwurst and a cellulose casing for Currywurst. <b></b>
</div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436470296/arhrzli5u8ztoeszux5j.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<i>Step 7. </i>
</div>
<div>Put the casing over the MeatMen filler and crank the handle until the meat mixture  flows into the casing. </div>

<i>Step 8. </i>

<p>Mit MeatMen ist das Selbermachen von Bratwürsten so einfach - gehe einfach folgende Schritte durch und schon bald liegt deine individuelle Bratwurst auf dem Grill.</p>
<p>Schritt 1:<br/>Stelle den MeatMen-Wurstfüller auf einen festen Untergrund.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438799590/eskxnsy3egcm0qrlaimc.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Schritt 2:<br/>Jetzt muss du etwas Wasser, Speiseöl und natürlich frisches Hackfleisch mischen. Wir empfehlen dir die Wahl eines regionalen Metzgers, um bestmögliche Frische, Umweltverträglichkeit und Fair Trade zu gewährleisten. Sei kreativ und füge weitere Zutaten hinzu, die gut mit deiner Bratwurst harmonieren. </p>

<div>Schritt 3:<br/>Jetzt wird gewürzt. Wir mixen die besten Kräuter und Gewürze zusammen - und glaube uns: In diesem Gebiet sind wir absolute Experten. In der MeatMen-Box findest du die Mischungen für Rostbratwurst und Currywurst. In Zukunft wirst du über unseren Online-Shop noch weitere Geschmacksrichtungen kaufen können, sodass von Bayern bis Schleswig-Holstein, von Japan bis in die USA jeder Griller seine lokale Bratwurst zusammenstellen kann.

MeatMen is your chance to create your own sausages with the taste you like most! You'll be able to combine anything with your Bratwurst like bacon, whiskey or wild garlic, or, or...
And we kindly ask for your support to produce the MeatMen. Join us.Thank you!
Lieber auf deutsch lesen? Scrolle bitte nach unten.

Do you love BBQ? Do you love the taste of a good-quality Bratwurst? We do. 
We are the team from MeatMen and with our project we'd like to achieve three goals:
1. Enjoy the original taste of German Bratwurst - no matter where you live. 
2. Make sure that your Bratwurst is made out of the best ingredients. 
3. Create your own sausages - with your own favorit taste.
MeatMen is all you need f.e. for homemade German Bratwurst. We've invented a solution for creating your own sausages incl.:



a meat filler: easy to use and especially easy to clean up


sausage casings: we add a natural collagen casing for the German Bratwurst and a cellulose casing for Berliner Currywurst


blend of spices: our secret, and our success - our spices guarantee a delicious Bratwurst (BBQ beginner and even Pros will make an impression with MeatMen)

original german sauces: what is a original Berliner Currywurst without a original Currysauce? You´ll get this in the MeatMen-Set, too. And more.
recipe brochure: easy, fast made recipes and ideas. Maybe your own created recipe is in the next brochure too. ;o)  
MeatMen-Clubcard: be the first with new recipes and new blend of spices. 

All you have to do is add some water, edible oil, and minced meat - from your local butchery. 

Our MeatMen set is still in ""beta""- so we kindly ask you to help us. To cut a long story short: We need money to start. We calculate with 25.000 EUR (~27,500 USD) for MeatMen's start:
producing and shipping of the meat filler
purchasing the spices and sausage casings
mixing the spices and filling them up in glasses
producing the packaging
setting up an online shop 
We don't talk about failure because we believe in the huge potential of our invention. But let's face the facts: not reaching our crowdfunding goal could be possible. We really appreciate your financial support and would nonetheless fund our startup with that money you gave us. Of course all of our perks will go out to you and together we will even work harder to bring MeatMen into life. 
With your investment you'll also help us to invent more tastes like Bratwurst Greek style.... or Asia style, or Italian style, or American BBQ style, or..., or...., or.... By talking about money you've just found out another cool thing about MeatMen:



You are the chef. You are the Head of Bratwurst Style. You will be the king of the grill.... don't believe? Read carefully, here are the amazing facts about MeatMen: 


we have created two blend of spices (original Bratwurst and Currywurst) and will come up with more (Greek and Asian style or a la Espagna - every regional taste is possible)

you'll make your homemade Bratwurst and we'll guarantee that it'll be always delicious
go one step further - be a sausage designer and add things like cheese, bacon, or herbs and vegetables like basil or wild garlic

Your creativity knows no limits in designing new tastes. We are sure that you'll find your very own style of Bratwurst. 
And another plus: MeatMen is good for people with food intolerance. You are in control of everything you add  to your Bratwurst. We mixed our blend of spices for MeatMen completely free of lactose, gluten, or glutamate. There will be no more unneccessary additives or flavor enhancers in your Bratwurst again.


With MeatMen it'll be so easy - just follow these simple instructions and your own created Bratwurst will soon be on your BBQ. 

Step 1.
Put the MeatMen meat filler on a firm footing.


Step 2.

You need to insert (at least) some water, edible oil and of course fresh minced pork meat - we prefer our local butchery to ensure freshness, purity, and fair trade. Feel free to add anything that could be a good fit in a Bratwurst.




Step 3.Yeah - it's spicy time... We really put the best and most delicious herbs and spices together. And believe us, we are experts! We will add two different blend of spices into our boxes - Original Rostbratwurst and Berlin Currywurst. In the future we will design more of those mixed spices and our German Bratwurst will become an international affair on BBQs' around the world. All our blends of spices are free of gluten, glutamate, and lactose. 



Step 4.

Come on and stir it up... put the mixture in your kitchen aid or use your mixer. Wait until you get a viscid melange. 


Step 5. 

Now it's time to load the meat filler...


Step 6.

We will add sausage casing in our MeatMen box. No trouble with perishableness - you can take a natural collagen casing for the Bratwurst and a cellulose casing for Currywurst. 



Step 7. 

Put the casing over the MeatMen filler and crank the handle until the meat mixture  flows into the casing. 


Step 8. 

Now we are nearly done... The sausages will be nonperishable when you cook them in 80 °C / 175 °F hot water for about 20 minutes. Hurry up and prepare your BBQ - it's time for the most delicious Bratwurst ever!



Step 9.

Guten Appetit! Enjoy your MeatMen Bratwurst with your friends and family. We guarentee: They will be delighted by the taste of your homemade and fresh German Bratwurst. 





With every perk you will be part of our Bratwurst BBQ community. We really say thank you for every kind of support.

<p>It was many years ago, as an Asthma sufferer, I took my filled pillow and twisted and turned it to get that perfect shape, which allowed for a comfortable night's sleep. After sleeping on this particular pillow shape for years, I purchased a small piece of foam to replicate the shape I made from the filled pillow. Low and behold, it worked wonders for me, helping me to breathe better and sleep better at nights.</p>
<p>A few years later, after realizing how beneficial the carved out foam was working for me, I purchased an even larger piece of foam to make actual full sized pillow in the hopes of helping others benefit in the same way he did. Seeking the advice of a Patent Attorney, I decided it was time to secure my pillow design so I can one day bring it to market.</p>

<p>For many years, people have been desperately searching for a few things relating to sleep: <br/>- A pillow that will provide proper neck and spine alignment and support.<br/>- A pillow that will resolve the issue of sleeping on your hands or sticking your hands under your pillow while sleeping, waking with cramped, painful, numb hands.<br/> <br/>Many have promised, but none have been able to truly deliver all of these crucial benefits until now, with the release of the Patented Gym Hoodie™ Side Sleeper pillow.

</div></div>","A little about me
Hey everyone, my name is Andres Roban, a.k.a. Gym Hoodie™. The name Gym Hoodie™ comes from the first product I developed, the gym hoodie fitness towel.
By Day, I am a Product Developer with Patents in the United States and China for these amazing pillows.
The Gym Hoodie™ Wrinkle Therapy pillow and the Gym Hoodie™ Side Sleeper pillow are guaranteed to eliminate the face crushing associated with sleeping on traditional pillows while providing a pillow option to dissuade individuals from sleeping on their hands.
 Patented in the United States and China

It was many years ago, as an Asthma sufferer, I took my filled pillow and twisted and turned it to get that perfect shape, which allowed for a comfortable night's sleep. After sleeping on this particular pillow shape for years, I purchased a small piece of foam to replicate the shape I made from the filled pillow. Low and behold, it worked wonders for me, helping me to breathe better and sleep better at nights.
A few years later, after realizing how beneficial the carved out foam was working for me, I purchased an even larger piece of foam to make actual full sized pillow in the hopes of helping others benefit in the same way he did. Seeking the advice of a Patent Attorney, I decided it was time to secure my pillow design so I can one day bring it to market.
After years of perfecting the pillow designs, from prototypes to molded samples, to having actual test subjects try these pillows out, they are now ready to take on the world.
How will my Patented Pillow help you?
For many years, people have been desperately searching for a few things relating to sleep: - A pillow that will provide proper neck and spine alignment and support.- A pillow that will resolve the issue of sleeping on your hands or sticking your hands under your pillow while sleeping, waking with cramped, painful, numb hands. Many have promised, but none have been able to truly deliver all of these crucial benefits until now, with the release of the Patented Gym Hoodie™ Side Sleeper pillow. Endorsed by New Jersey Chiropractor, Dr. Jack Atzmon, a recognized Chiropractic expert in Repetitive Stress injuries, ""these pillows are sure to motivate individuals to take a more proactive approach to promoting proper back/neck/spine alignment and the way they care for wrist and hand health.""  
The Gym Hoodie™ Side Sleeper Pillow
The Gym Hoodie™ Side Sleeper pillow. This pillow is also designed with a head-cradling surface, shoulder curves and chin support. This pillow does have hand-rest grooves, a place where you gently lay your hands while sleeping. This is an amazing alternative to sleeping on your hands or sticking them under the pillow while sleeping, causing you to wake with numbing, cramped hands.

- Designed for side sleepers
- Made with Memory Foam
- Hand Rest Grooves. No more cramped hands by allowing the sleeper to gently rest their hands in the hand-rest grooves, as opposed to sleeping on them or sticking them under the pillow. 
- Surface contour, providing amazing head-cradling comfort
- Shoulder Curves, which allows a person to nestle into the pillow
- Satin pillowcases for each pillow(if we reach our Stretch Goals of $150,000), which will not pull your hair out and increase facial wrinkles while sleeping like cotton and polyester cases would.
- This pillow is perfect height, accommodating shoulder to neck distance, thereby allowing for proper neck/spine alignment.

Under every pillowcase are specific contours and curves on the pillow surface, designed to cradle your head, allow for proper neck/spine alignment and dissuade you from laying on your hands.

<li>Products are <strong>non-comedogenic</strong> and <strong>fragrance-free.</strong>

<li>The active ingredient in Defense Sunscreen is a <strong>non-nanoparticle zinc oxide</strong>. It does not absorb into the skin and possibly cause hormone disruption or cancer, and is the <strong>only</strong> FDA-approved sunscreen ingredient for children under 6 months old.</li>
<li>Non-nanoparticle zinc oxide is <b>safe for ocean reefs,</b> is <strong>biodegradable </strong>and has <strong>broad</strong> <strong>spectrum</strong> protection against UVA &amp; UVB rays.</li>

The highest priority is to stay fit and healthy for training and games, and when <strong>you feel amazing, you perform </strong><strong>amazing</strong>. When you wash off the sweat and dirt after a game, no residue should be left and your skin and hair should be not dry. When you use sunscreen, it should not feel chalky or wear off after a little sweat. When you need a bit of warming cream to activate your muscles, it should not burn your skin.</p><p>By providing athletes with products made from <strong>organic, vegan and animal-friendly choices</strong>, they not only help themselves, but also can affect a <strong>positive change one cosmetic bottle or tube at a time</strong>.</p><p><u><strong>Getting the Word Out There</strong></u><br/>Sport Botanics relies on Instagram, Facebook, the KicksAndChronicles.com blog  and newsletters to promote the brand and products.

Preparing media kits and samples is one specific way to have athletes use products, and in return athletes can post images or videos on social media networks to promote Sport Botanics.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470049305/o4rkbsnanauuiqv3zwps.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470049516/pq87kbloliyxoelbpiqq.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470049529/fnllegcebnvdu6p0wbtq.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470049544/gkaytvnliypcd1thaaca.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471423493/b10dmwjtvevwls4hrisc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471423500/xyxvpkdn8v2omaz8bkg7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471423523/e3bcmjpksnacmxvslljj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471423528/fyqnftotroxlydeft4xg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p><u><strong>How Do We Sell Our Products?</strong></u><br/>Shopify makes it easy to manage the Sport Botanics e-commerce store.

Other data I came across was the severe body effects and skin reactions from common, but harmful ingredients. Needless to say, I had had enough. I immediately had my light bulb moment!I started scouring the internet for natural recipes, manufacturing and quality ingredients in order to start making my own products at home. After much trial, error and success, I am now working with a scientist from Stanford University with a Masters in Biochemistry. I am so excited about the first product, Defense - a SPF 32 mineral sunscreen with non-nano zinc oxide, 86% organic and all natural ingredients. We have an original formula with SPF 32 and a tinted formula with SPF 31. Later in the year, we will be introducing 2-in-1 hair and body wash, as well as muscle relaxing cream and other products.Check out the life-changing skin, body and environmental benefits of Sport Botanics products and ingredients:
All of Sport Botanics' products are made with natural, organic, vegan and animal-friendly ingredients. Some of the favorites are organic sunflower, jojoba and olive oils.
Products are non-comedogenic and fragrance-free.

The active ingredient in Defense Sunscreen is a non-nanoparticle zinc oxide. It does not absorb into the skin and possibly cause hormone disruption or cancer, and is the only FDA-approved sunscreen ingredient for children under 6 months old.
Non-nanoparticle zinc oxide is safe for ocean reefs, is biodegradable and has broad spectrum protection against UVA & UVB rays.
Defense Sunscreen is gluten-free, corn-free, soy-free and dairy-free.

The tinted version of Defense Sunscreen uses natural iron oxides to blend in with the skin and create an even glow.
 So, why organic in body care? Vast amounts of scientific evidence (and your own common sense) prove organically produced fruits and veggies have higher levels of vitamins and nutrients than conventional ones. If athletes can benefit from extra nourishment with organic food intake, imagine the impact on sports performance through organic skin and body care - substantially less likelihood of rashes, redness, itchiness, flakiness or dryness.High-performance athletes have so much to worry about - coaches, team tactics, diet, traveling, strength training, school or work and games. The highest priority is to stay fit and healthy for training and games, and when you feel amazing, you perform amazing. When you wash off the sweat and dirt after a game, no residue should be left and your skin and hair should be not dry. When you use sunscreen, it should not feel chalky or wear off after a little sweat. When you need a bit of warming cream to activate your muscles, it should not burn your skin.By providing athletes with products made from organic, vegan and animal-friendly choices, they not only help themselves, but also can affect a positive change one cosmetic bottle or tube at a time.Getting the Word Out ThereSport Botanics relies on Instagram, Facebook, the KicksAndChronicles.com blog  and newsletters to promote the brand and products. With images, GIFs, videos and blog posts, I plan to build the expand these networks over the next several months.Having a huge network of professional friends, including athletes, amateur and young players, coaches, trainers and sport associations, allows Sport Botanics to have a direct link to the field, court or track. Preparing media kits and samples is one specific way to have athletes use products, and in return athletes can post images or videos on social media networks to promote Sport Botanics.  How Do We Sell Our Products?Shopify makes it easy to manage the Sport Botanics e-commerce store. We send all products to Amazon. After a purchase is made in our store, FBA will handle all packing, storage and shipping to customers . FBA will make it easier to meet the needs of 4 major global markets (USA, Canada, Mexico and Germany).Examining major global brands like Nike and Under Armour, we want to follow suit and create products that not only appeal to athletes, but also the athlete in you. Everyone benefits from great body and skin care.PerksHere are the gifts you can receive:

Contribute Towards a Better FutureI have a deep passion and relentless motivation to change athlete perspectives on body care. My promise to athletes, contributors, consumers and myself is that I will do everything in my power to make a difference in athletes’ lives. I will research, investigate, read, question, create, write, learn and build anything that will help Sport Botanics have a positive impact.Hopefully, I have sparked your interest toward providing organic, vegan and animal-friendly products to athletes.

<p>Since ancient times people knew that hot smoke can be
damaging to lung’s health. Indeed, medical studies show that Bullous and other
lung diseases are mostly caused by inhaling hot fumes. Creating devices that
cool smoke has been an ongoing effort for millennia and eventually has become
an art. This is the reason we now enjoy incredibly large variety of intricate
smoking devices such as water-pipes and hookahs. Unfortunately, since the
beginning of times all smoking devices that effectively cool hot fumes were

</div></div>","WELCOME TO THE FUTURE OF SMOKING!

In over 5000 years since the pipe was invented, many minds worked on 
improving the performance adding new features, creating mind-blowing art
 pieces. But with the modern on-the-go lifestyle we needed a smoking 
device that is harmless, functional, durable, easy to operate, portable,
 discreet and eye-pleasing. Here it is – GeniusPipe – the ultimate 
smoking experience for thousands of people around the world and soon for
 you!

GENIUS FEATURES



How this new Genius 4.0 edition is
different from the previous model?

Genius 4.0 is still made of
surgical grade aluminum, however, the new manufacturing process allows for these advancements over Genius 3.0
series:- Better precision, cleaner lines, and better air flow- More durable and scratch resistant finish - Unlimited color variations- Custom image printing 

JUST PACK'N'SMOKE




No cable or battery needed. It doesn’t need water or ice or large size to perform. We removed all challenges from the user! It's just a 3-piece magnetic pocket pipe. Genius is pleasant to hold, easy to replace screen, easy to pack and cache the ash, and easy to smoke. And if it falls flat on the ground, your biggest challenge will be leaning down to pick it up and smoke. 


SLIDE'N'SMOKE


Magnetic sliding cover will protect from spilling and contain the smell. Keep it out in the open before the eyes of many and chances are no one will know what it is.  Although, it could be a conversation starter. Slide'N'Smoke through the logo in the cover for the most efficient way to smoke.


GENIUS COVER


If you prefer to smoke Genius without the cover, we made sure that you don't lose it! :)


CASH THE ASH

Steel sliding cover is not only beautiful but also functional. Its corners fit perfectly into the bowl and can be used to cache the ash. 

GENIUS BOWL



Genius two-tiered bowl is perfectly designed to hold standard 0.75” screen.  However, your GeniusPipe will come packed with high temperature resistant, self-repairing Genius TruTaste Screen.  Specifically designed to eliminate drawbacks to pipe screen use such as metallic taste and loose wires, Genius TruTaste screen won't change integrity after multiple cleanings and won't burn through. It will fit Genius bowl perfectly and is super easy to remove!

GENIUS DIMPLES

GeniusPipe's  2000 dimples are always hard at work. As you can see, tar, oils and resin are captured immediately at the top, way before it can get to you.



CLEANING GENIUS

Genius cleaning is easy and fast!  We took a one minute cleaning challenge and here's what we got...



HEALTH & TECHNOLOGY







NO COUGH - GUARANTEED!GENIUSPIPE FILTERS OUT 95% OF ALL THE TAR AND RESIN. SMOKE COMES OUT SUPER SMOOTH AND CLEAN!




WHY COOLING SMOKE IS SO IMPORTANT?



Since ancient times people knew that hot smoke can be
damaging to lung’s health. Indeed, medical studies show that Bullous and other
lung diseases are mostly caused by inhaling hot fumes. Creating devices that
cool smoke has been an ongoing effort for millennia and eventually has become
an art. This is the reason we now enjoy incredibly large variety of intricate
smoking devices such as water-pipes and hookahs. Unfortunately, since the
beginning of times all smoking devices that effectively cool hot fumes were
also large in size. And all portable devices such as pipes did not effectively
cool the smoke… Until now.
Genius is the revolutionary pipe that combines the best of
both worlds. It can easily fit into your pocket and it cools hot smoke more effectively than any other smoking device. 




WHY ANODIZED ALUMINUM?

Aluminum’s
Thermal Conductivity is 250 times greater than glass and 1000 times greater
than wood. This means that cooling effect of Genius is same as 250 glass pipes
or 1000 wooden pipes! 
Aluminum is one of the safest materials on Earth.
“Aluminum is the third most abundant element after oxygen  and silicon. It makes up about
8% by weight of the Earth's solid surface. Despite its  natural abundance,
aluminum has no known function in biology. It is remarkably nontoxic.”- Wikipedia
“Average
person consumes 0.12 mg of Aluminum every day and can ingest much larger
amounts of aluminum than in the diet, possibly as high as 71 mg a day.”
- Centers for Disease Control (CDC) 





WHY DIMPLES?






A
golf ball with dimples flies much further than a smooth one because each vortex
created by a dimple acts like a bearing made of air.
Same effect  is created inside GeniusPipe.  Thousands of vortexes, created with each breath, filter and cool the smoke better than water!The
Dimple technology used in Genius has been used in variety of applications:
Super quiet fans, Military supersonic jets, Cycle sport,
Nuclear power plants, Track and field, Super fast trains, Fuel-efficient cars,
Stealth Submarines, Food storage, Gaming Computers, Boiler tanks, and even
High-tech weaponry - all utilize Dimple Technology!

<h3>A Message from the inventor</h3>
<div>
<p>Would you believe that a single herb could be the answer to multiple medical mysteries of our time?</p>
<p><i>For nearly Twenty years , I  endeavored  to find a medicine that could help with many debilitating conditions that was afflicting many friends and people around me . I was inspired at the time to discover a single natural substance that could serve as a remedy; being able to settle most questions that related to good health.</i></p>
<p><i>I realized, in order to develop a natural remedy, it would require an extensive knowledge base in medicine. This initiated my endeavor to pursue a degree in  Natural Medicine and ultimately, my dream of producing a remedy. Through the study of medical science in homeopathy, I learned to discern the obstacles that would hinder the progress towards a cure.

<p>It has taken over 5 years in order to get approval from Health Canada. Health Canada is the equivalent of the FDA in the US and is been known to be more stringent with their testing. Our results in the last 3 years have been fantastic. We felt that in order to do this right that we needed to get government approval for this product before we put it to market despite the fact that we are a very small company with few resources we manage to do just that. We feel that we are now  ready to bring this powerful medicine to the world and we need your help to do it. We need your help to be able to produce it in a large scale to meet the expected demand, unfortunately at the moment we can only produce in small quantities because our resources are small. (We need a larger farm facility to produce the raw product as well get full time production to the lab so we can bring our costs down and some office space. Up until now we have planted every plant by hand and reaped it by hand and we will like to continue doing it that way so we can control the quality and effectiveness of this medicine as well to keep the formulation propritory), oh and one more thing 20% of all moneys raised through this campaign will go to producing ProlenaOne to be given for free to people that cannot afford it, so please, give from the heart whatever you can afford. For these above contributions we will be going out to the local shelters ,underprivileged areas and old folks that cannot afford most medicines and distributed in person and we will list individuals info in our website so contributors know were their money went to.

A Message from the inventor

Would you believe that a single herb could be the answer to multiple medical mysteries of our time?
For nearly Twenty years , I  endeavored  to find a medicine that could help with many debilitating conditions that was afflicting many friends and people around me . I was inspired at the time to discover a single natural substance that could serve as a remedy; being able to settle most questions that related to good health.
I realized, in order to develop a natural remedy, it would require an extensive knowledge base in medicine. This initiated my endeavor to pursue a degree in  Natural Medicine and ultimately, my dream of producing a remedy. Through the study of medical science in homeopathy, I learned to discern the obstacles that would hinder the progress towards a cure. I became abreast of the major diseases prevalent in today's society, which would assist in the development of an interesting, valuable, and successful remedy. Fortunately, through the years, I have been exposed to practical experiences that outlined various health conditions and information necessary to my dream becoming a reality. Specifically, I would come into contact with individuals inflicted with illnesses that fit the criteria for ProlenaOne.
I steadily gained progress as many people aided in the process and made production of ProlenaOne possible. There have been numerous remarkable testimonials and information based on the consumers' healing processes. Many of which were dealing with persistent, weakening, and deteriorating diseases. I was able to successfully treat conditions exceeding the reach of conventional medicine.
As time progressed, I was able to appreciate my role in helping others through their difficult illnesses. The rewarding satisfaction in contributing to society and serving for a cause greater than myself, was beyond my vision. I am very grateful for the opportunity thatProlenaOne has provided, as it has helped individuals cope and get through difficult times in their lives. As well, it has given them a sense of purpose and hope.""

<p>Meet the Radius. When you need a serious mask that combines comfort, breathability, durability, and reduces environmental impact while maintaining the highest quality of N95 filtration – you need the Radius.</p>
<p><strong>The Radius offers valveless 2-way N95 filter protection and filters during both inhalation and exhalation, keeping both you and those around you safe</strong>. Unlike vented masks (which the CDC currently recommends against) which do not filter exhalation or disposable cloth masks which do not filter inhalation.</p>
<p>The Radius mask has been tested by Nelson Labs and conforms to NIOSH NRC120 criterion for airflow resistance, - 42 CFR Part 84.180, and is in compliance with US FDA GMP regulations 21 CFR Parts 210, 211, and 820.</p>

<p>In early March 2020, Rory Larson saw an opportunity to help communities build resiliency by 3D printing personal protection equipment (PPE) that was desperately needed to support the safety of individuals, and most importantly, frontline and essential workers. During a marathon 3D printing design session lasting 48 hours, Rory created the first 3D printed respirator. With the help of a Seattle non-profit, the Maker Mask movement was launched with the intent to initially focus on distributing free 3D printed designs across the nation, and the world.</p>
<p>After the original design received approval from the <a href=""https://3dprint.nih.gov/discover/3dpx-013607"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">National Institute of Health</a> (NIH) we began receiving inquiries and new feature requests.  As Maker Mask continued to evolve and release new product designs, we learned that the demand both domestically and internationally far outpaced the capabilities of community makers and the small-batch manufacturers. We are now shifting to injection molding (IM) production to promote manufacturing efficiency and need your help to do so.</p>
<h3>Radius Mask Overview</h3>
<p>The Radius' simple design allows for intuitive use. The mask, covers, tray, and replaceable filters enable users to continually clean and reuse the masks to maximize comfort, minimize environmental impact, and prolong mask lifespan. </p>

<h3>Radius vs. Other Masks</h3>
<p>Not all masks are created equally!  The efficacy of a mask is determined by 2 things: the filter quality and the seal of the mask to your face.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603427279/mpbg57alrlk73u8ukzjk.jpg"" src=""""/>The Radius is an improvement on other mask alternatives for these key reasons: </p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Comfortable:</strong> The Radius Mask is made of silicone which forms a tight seal to the face maximizing comfort and protection for the user.</li>
<li>
<strong> Reusable:</strong> N95, surgical, and cloth masks must be disposed of frequently. The Radius mask is durable and can be cleaned allowing for hundreds of uses. We don't have to compromise sustainability for protection - we can protect ourselves and the environment simultaneously.</li>
<li> <strong>Breathable:</strong> Other masks lack adequate airflow making it difficult for the user to breathe. The Radius' unique valveless design with 3 large 2-way filters allows for increased airflow while maintaining high-quality filtration.</li>
<li> <strong>Effective: </strong>Surgical and cloth masks do not provide 2-way protection! Our N95 filters provide 2-way protection, protecting you when breathing in and others when breathing out.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Filters:</strong> Each of the Radius’ 3 filters provide an N95 level of protection which is effective in filtering out airborne particles up to .3 microns during inhalation and exhalation. The filters are extremely easy to change by simply twisting and clicking the caps on and off. We recommend following the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/hcwcontrols/recommendedguidanceextuse.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CDC guidelines</a> for cleaning and frequency of changing the filters.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fit: </strong>The Radius is made in a flexible silicone that forms to the face to create a tight, yet comfortable fit.  It comes in 3 sizes* with adjustable strapping for the individual allowing for a customized fit. </li>
</ul>
<p>        *the first production run will be size Medium only </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Cost:</strong> With Injection Molding production the Radius can be efficiently mass-produced to provide maximum protection at a low cost. We are pricing the Radius mask to recover costs and to provide funding for our mission-related programs. With this approach, the mask is exceptionally affordable in comparison to other reusable options.</li>
<li>
<strong>Impact:</strong> In comparison to disposable masks, the Radius can be cleaned and worn hundreds of times, therefore, minimizing waste. We also provide the option to receive a mask for yourself and fund the donation of a mask to a frontline or essential worker.</li>

<h3>Nice to meet you.</h3>
<p>Hi, Marshal and Brad here. We live in Austin, Texas. We are fun, passionate individuals who believe in making the world a better place and that starts with helping each other. Here at <b>GAMMA,</b> we believe that your mental health is as important as your physical health. So, we set out to make a naturally derived neural pathway supplement that supports your brain function and health.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1587769091/ovyhcudx4ljegrvqehak.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>What about the Ingredients?</h3>
<p>Let's get down to brass tacks. Here's a quick list of our beneficial ingredients.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1589068250/i8dplpb8lbholktksihz.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Each ingredient in <strong>GAMMA</strong> was thoughtfully picked to deliver the best possible stack for optimal performance. Similar in qualities, yet each brings its own specialty to the table. The <strong>GAMMA</strong> ""stack"" is designed for balance and neural release creating one of the best nootropics on the market today.   </p>
<h2>What our clients are saying.</h2>

<h3>The Impact.  </h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1587840129/i776vxujqa8qbv24qw5w.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>It's no secret that our society's intellectual standard has dropped a tad bit. We find ourselves more impressed with the persona that we portray online than our actual reality.  While <strong>GAMMA</strong> won't completely solve our plummeting IQ scores, it will certainly help to ameliorate the trend.</p>
<p><strong>Our goal is to bring awareness to our social and mental epidemic. Shine a light on the fact that our mental health is just as important as our physical health.</strong> We should be eating the right nutritious foods that promote brain activity and of course, taking supplements like <strong>GAMMA</strong> that support both said habits. Let us be clear, social media is a great tool especially when it is used correctly in a <u>balanced</u> routine/lifestyle. Join us BACKER WARRIORS as we aim to unlock the limitless potential of our minds!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>In The Know.</h3>
<p>Some of you are probably not familiar with what a nootropic is, and why you should be taking a nootropic supplement like<strong> GAMMA.</strong> Simply put, nootropics incorporate natural or synthetic antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, amino acids, fatty acids, and other herbal ingredients combined (""stacked"") together in order to improve cognitive performance.  </p>
<p>The very first synthesized nootropic – a substance that inspired researcher C.E. Giurgea to coin the term “nootropic” and conceptualize the category of cognitive enhancers in the first place – was Piracetam. All modern ""racetams"" derive from Piracetam. Why did I tell you this? Because 2 of our main ingredients in <strong>GAMMA</strong> include racetams!</p>
<p>As well as knowing what racetams are, it is also useful to understand what they are not:</p>
<p>They are <u>not</u> stimulants, for instance, and don’t aim to affect the stimulating neurotransmitters that often bring side effects such as anxiety, insomnia, or the jitters, which is what other nootropic supplements can do. </p>
<p>Speaking of the competition, let's take a look at some key ingredients our competitors are using in their nootropics that you need to watch out for... </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1594690701/wecvdvtyqqcrlu7ooohw.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h2><strong>So Why Take GAMMA?</strong></h2>
<p>Below is a simulation of a neuron sending a signal to another neuron.  A single neural link can fire 5 - 50 times every second! If you extrapolate that between all the neural links in your brain, you can fire between 50 - 1,000 Trillion synapses (no that is not a typo). In case you didn't notice, that is a HUGE difference! The stronger the links the better and more often the synapses fire. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/Lo6Ctv191xhPcZWGu5/giphy.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>When you take GAMMA, the link between neural pathways gets stronger i.e. a better signal can be delivered. Below is a simulation of how GAMMA starts working over a 10 day period. </p>

<p>A good nootropic is not a ""quick fix"". As we said earlier, it is not a stimulant and therefore it takes some time to take effect. Our formula is strategically designed to cross the blood/brain barrier and over time you will start to <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/2577906/x/16581542?secret_perk_token=2af2cdd4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">peak</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Below is a breakdown of what each ingredient does for the brain:</strong> </p>
<p><strong><u>SASSAFRAS</u></strong>- It is the natural delivery mechanism for our formula. Safrole, the main ingredient found in sassafras is an acetylcholine ""AChE"" inhibitor. Choline is what helps keeps you alert. It is the building block of memory formation. Clinical studies have also shown that sassafras inhibits cancer in lab rats. </p>
<p><strong><u>GREEN TEA LEAF</u></strong>- Being rich in antioxidants, Green Tea Leaf helps reduce oxidative stress by fighting cell damage caused by free radicals. Furthermore, it increases the cognitive capacity for memory by enhancing the connection between different receptors of the brain.</p>
<p><strong><u>GUARANA</u></strong>- Rich in caffeine, reducing fatigue, and improving focus. Adenosine is a compound that makes you feel drowsy and helps your brain relax. The caffeine found in guarana blocks the effects of adenosine by binding to the receptors and preventing them from being activated.</p>
<p><strong><u>ANIRACETAM</u></strong>- Part of the racetam family. Aniracetam acts as a positive modulator and decreases the rate of receptor desensitization. It also targets specific serotonin and dopamine receptors increasing mood and behavior while alleviating depression. It also helps increase the levels of our natural neurotransmitter, acetylcholine. </p>
<p><strong><u>GLUTATHIONE</u></strong>- A powerful antioxidant that is naturally produced in the body. Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease are both linked to oxidative stress and low levels of glutathione. Increased levels of glutathione in the body have been linked to improving cognitive function and assisting users diagnosed with OCD, ADHD, IBS, autism, AND cancer. Increasing the levels of this antioxidant in your body may help slow or ameliorate the progression of these neurodegenerative disorders.</p>
<p><strong><u>L-THEANINE</u></strong>- Derived from green tea leaf and fungi. L-Theanine acts as a calming agent, reducing anxiety while boosting the brain's dopamine levels. It is synergistic with caffeine, helping to alleviate the 'edge' found in stimulants while promoting cognition and attention.</p>
<p><strong><u>THEOBROMINE</u></strong>- Theobromine comes from the cacoa plant, which is used to make chocolate. Promoting heart health, theobromine naturally lowers blood pressure. Like caffeine, it is a stimulant, boosting alertness and improving concentration. Studies have shown that theobromine has been found to increase concentration and focus immediately following ingestion.</p>
<p><strong><u>PHENYLPIRACETAM</u></strong>- Part of the racetam family. Phenylpiracetam possesses psychostimulatory properties that help decrease the rate of cognitive decline and enhance physical performance. It increases tolerance to pain and cold weather.</p>
<p><strong><u>NOOPEPT</u></strong>- Developed from the core molecule in piracetam (proline) and combined with the structure of a neuropeptide. Noopept enters systemic and cerebral circulation with excellent bioavailability. It enhances mood and relieves stress.</p>
<p><strong>GAMMA</strong> is about balance and quality. We have many ""health hacks"" that will enhance the effects and potency of our supplement.  <strong> </strong></p>
<h3>A Flexible Goal??</h3>
<p>Yes, and what that means is, you are getting a bottle of <strong>GAMMA</strong> no matter if our goal is met or not! The reason? MOQ  (Minimum Order Quantity). The more support we have from <u>you</u> the less money it will cost us to get <strong>GAMMA</strong> to you. This, in turn, allows us to offer very competitive prices and deliver <strong>GAMMA</strong> to you at the best price possible.</p>

<p>We are aware that the FDA does not approve of some of the ingredients in <strong>GAMMA</strong>, specifically, Sassafras, Phenylpiracetam, Aniracetam, and Noopept.  </p>
<p>The truth is, Sassafras has been used for thousands of years and is a natural key component to help deliver nutrients to the body.

Nice to meet you.
Hi, Marshal and Brad here. We live in Austin, Texas. We are fun, passionate individuals who believe in making the world a better place and that starts with helping each other. Here at GAMMA, we believe that your mental health is as important as your physical health. So, we set out to make a naturally derived neural pathway supplement that supports your brain function and health.

What about the Ingredients?
Let's get down to brass tacks. Here's a quick list of our beneficial ingredients.

Each ingredient in GAMMA was thoughtfully picked to deliver the best possible stack for optimal performance. Similar in qualities, yet each brings its own specialty to the table. The GAMMA ""stack"" is designed for balance and neural release creating one of the best nootropics on the market today.   
What our clients are saying.


Here's the playbook.   

Ok IndieGoGo fam, here is a breakdown of how your donation will be used:
The total amount we are trying to raise is $20,000. The full amount will be going to the GMP facility. That's right, the whole $20,000 will be used to open the doors of production. That means you will have effectively contributed to making this dream of ours a reality.
Check out some of the awesome perks you'll get based on your level of donation:
                                                                                         ➪           ➪           ➪            ➪
                                                                                         ➪           ➪           ➪            ➪

The Impact.  

It's no secret that our society's intellectual standard has dropped a tad bit. We find ourselves more impressed with the persona that we portray online than our actual reality.  While GAMMA won't completely solve our plummeting IQ scores, it will certainly help to ameliorate the trend.
Our goal is to bring awareness to our social and mental epidemic. Shine a light on the fact that our mental health is just as important as our physical health. We should be eating the right nutritious foods that promote brain activity and of course, taking supplements like GAMMA that support both said habits. Let us be clear, social media is a great tool especially when it is used correctly in a balanced routine/lifestyle. Join us BACKER WARRIORS as we aim to unlock the limitless potential of our minds!

In The Know.
Some of you are probably not familiar with what a nootropic is, and why you should be taking a nootropic supplement like GAMMA. Simply put, nootropics incorporate natural or synthetic antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, amino acids, fatty acids, and other herbal ingredients combined (""stacked"") together in order to improve cognitive performance.  
The very first synthesized nootropic – a substance that inspired researcher C.E. Giurgea to coin the term “nootropic” and conceptualize the category of cognitive enhancers in the first place – was Piracetam. All modern ""racetams"" derive from Piracetam. Why did I tell you this? Because 2 of our main ingredients in GAMMA include racetams!
As well as knowing what racetams are, it is also useful to understand what they are not:
They are not stimulants, for instance, and don’t aim to affect the stimulating neurotransmitters that often bring side effects such as anxiety, insomnia, or the jitters, which is what other nootropic supplements can do. 
Speaking of the competition, let's take a look at some key ingredients our competitors are using in their nootropics that you need to watch out for... 

So Why Take GAMMA?
Below is a simulation of a neuron sending a signal to another neuron.  A single neural link can fire 5 - 50 times every second! If you extrapolate that between all the neural links in your brain, you can fire between 50 - 1,000 Trillion synapses (no that is not a typo). In case you didn't notice, that is a HUGE difference! The stronger the links the better and more often the synapses fire. 

When you take GAMMA, the link between neural pathways gets stronger i.e. a better signal can be delivered. Below is a simulation of how GAMMA starts working over a 10 day period. 

A good nootropic is not a ""quick fix"". As we said earlier, it is not a stimulant and therefore it takes some time to take effect. Our formula is strategically designed to cross the blood/brain barrier and over time you will start to peak.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>What if there was a way to <strong>prevent hangover symptoms </strong>from even starting?  Recoverthol is the <strong>world’s first liquid supplement</strong> that can be added to alcoholic drinks <strong>without affecting the taste</strong>.</p>
<p>After years of research and development we launched Recoverthol in Australia in 2018 with a large following of satisfied customers.  Please help us to take Recoverthol to the rest of the world by supporting our global expansion.</p>
<p>Unlike other liver tonic-based hangover products that contain herbal ingredients to alleviate the symptoms of alcohol consumption, Recoverthol only <strong>contains fuel for the enzymes</strong> involved in alcohol metabolism.</p>
<p>Recoverthol has been specifically designed to be <strong>added into alcoholic drinks</strong> so that the necessary fuel can reach the enzymes at the same time as alcohol. This is a world-first innovation in hangover management which promotes the more efficient metabolism of alcohol <strong>whilst you are drinking</strong>.</p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/_tWMGv56Alk?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div style=""text-align: center;""> </div>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><u><i><strong>**All 40 contributors will have their products shipped within one week!</strong></i></u></div>
<div style=""text-align: center;""> </div>
<p>Other hangover prevention products on the market attempt to tackle symptoms the next day (when they are in full swing) or at the end of a night of drinking when the damage is already done.</p>
<p>Recoverthol is different as it starts to work right from the time you start drinking and assists in avoiding the development of hangover symptoms from the outset.</p>
<p>Some of our customers have also reported that Recoverthol assists in reducing the symptoms of <strong>Alcohol flush syndrome</strong> (Asian Flush) which is caused by the build up of toxins associated with alcohol consumption (i.e. acetaldehyde).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567470943/xylwfakv9uz31nge6mjj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Recoverthol allows you to get ahead of hangover symptoms by providing an <strong>extra boost of cofactors and coenzymes</strong> that your body needs naturally to process alcohol efficiently.</p>
<p>No more having to take awful tasting shots or fizzy, sugary drinks the next morning when you are already feeling the pain of hangover symptoms (e.g. headache, nausea and tiredness).  You will be able to handle next day activities (such as spending time with the kids) with a lot more energy and vigour!  </p>

<h3><strong>Research and Development</strong></h3>
<p>Recoverthol is the brainchild of an Australian pharmacist and has been <strong>developed and manufactured entirely in Australia</strong>. Recoverthol is <strong>more than just a ‘me-too’ liver tonic</strong> like most other hangover products on the market that contain long lists of vitamins and exotic ingredients.</p>
<p>Alarmingly, there is little to no scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of these ingredients, yet people still buy these products in the hope of finding a golden bullet. </p>
<p>Recoverthol was formulated <strong>on the basis of the science of alcohol metabolism</strong>.  For the scientists out there, Recoverthol supplies additional cofactors and co-enzymes that are the fuel for the Alcohol Dehydrogenase (ADH) enzyme to process alcohol.</p>
<p>Recoverthol has been specifically designed to be added to alcoholic drinks so that these cofactors and co-enzymes can reach the ADH enzyme at the same time as alcohol.</p>

<div style=""text-align: center;""> </div>
<p>We are dedicated to educating people about how to look after yourself whilst you get the most out of life. We all like to let our hair down from time to time and enjoy the company of friends over a few drinks.</p>
<p>Recoverthol was formulated to assist in <strong>preventing hangover symptoms before they begin</strong>, allowing you to enjoy yourself and to get the most out of the next day.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why use Recoverthol?</h3>
<p>Recoverthol is <strong>superior and more convenient in comparison to other hangover products </strong>because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has a unique delivery method which involves SNAPPING and SQUEEZING a small liquid supplement into a drink.</li>
<li>The formulation is clear, and when added to alcohol it is <strong>odourless and tasteless</strong>. It will not affect the taste of your drink.</li>
<li>Recoverthol is <strong>taken when you start drinking</strong> (not before or after) so that you can get ahead of your hangover symptoms before they even begin. </li>
<li>No additional fillers. </li>
<li>Each dose is a <strong>small 2ml liquid vial </strong>that can easily fit into your pocket or handbag. </li>
<li>Recoverthol is TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration - Australia) listed and manufactured in Australia in a <strong>TGA and FDA approved</strong> facility to ensure the ingredients and manufacturing processes are of the highest quality and standard.</li>
<li>Anecdotal evidence suggests that Recoverthol may assist in <strong>reducing the symptoms of Asian flush</strong> (alcohol flush syndrome).</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Encouraging a responsible drinking culture</h3>
<p>Recoverthol is a hangover management product in one sense, but it’s also about giving you the tools to better manage your drinking habits.  We have created a <strong>free (drinks calculator) <a href=""https://recoverthol.com.au/app/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mobile app</a></strong> (for iOS and android users) that is a great tool for encouraging you to learn more about and improve your drinking habits.  </p>
<p>                                         <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566476172/qullfodk3aaqtnazr3ew.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The Recoverthol App is a self-quantifying tool that you can use to predict the effect of alcoholic beverages on your body (based on weight and gender) prior to drinking.  It keeps a track of how many standard drinks you have consumed so that you can stick to recommended safe drinking guidelines. </p>
<p>The app also calculates the time to sober so that the user can estimate what time they would need to stop drinking in order to be sober for work the next day OR to allow for a good night’s sleep.</p>

**Get ahead of your hangover for less than less $4.00 a night (as low as $2 for larger purchases)
 
Our Story
What if there was a way to prevent hangover symptoms from even starting?  Recoverthol is the world’s first liquid supplement that can be added to alcoholic drinks without affecting the taste.
After years of research and development we launched Recoverthol in Australia in 2018 with a large following of satisfied customers.  Please help us to take Recoverthol to the rest of the world by supporting our global expansion.
Unlike other liver tonic-based hangover products that contain herbal ingredients to alleviate the symptoms of alcohol consumption, Recoverthol only contains fuel for the enzymes involved in alcohol metabolism.
Recoverthol has been specifically designed to be added into alcoholic drinks so that the necessary fuel can reach the enzymes at the same time as alcohol. This is a world-first innovation in hangover management which promotes the more efficient metabolism of alcohol whilst you are drinking.

 
**All 40 contributors will have their products shipped within one week!
 
Other hangover prevention products on the market attempt to tackle symptoms the next day (when they are in full swing) or at the end of a night of drinking when the damage is already done.
Recoverthol is different as it starts to work right from the time you start drinking and assists in avoiding the development of hangover symptoms from the outset.
Some of our customers have also reported that Recoverthol assists in reducing the symptoms of Alcohol flush syndrome (Asian Flush) which is caused by the build up of toxins associated with alcohol consumption (i.e. acetaldehyde).
 

 
Recoverthol allows you to get ahead of hangover symptoms by providing an extra boost of cofactors and coenzymes that your body needs naturally to process alcohol efficiently.
No more having to take awful tasting shots or fizzy, sugary drinks the next morning when you are already feeling the pain of hangover symptoms (e.g. headache, nausea and tiredness).  You will be able to handle next day activities (such as spending time with the kids) with a lot more energy and vigour!  

We have great customer reviews. Recoverthol could be the solution for you!
 

 
Research and Development
Recoverthol is the brainchild of an Australian pharmacist and has been developed and manufactured entirely in Australia. Recoverthol is more than just a ‘me-too’ liver tonic like most other hangover products on the market that contain long lists of vitamins and exotic ingredients.
Alarmingly, there is little to no scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of these ingredients, yet people still buy these products in the hope of finding a golden bullet. 
Recoverthol was formulated on the basis of the science of alcohol metabolism.  For the scientists out there, Recoverthol supplies additional cofactors and co-enzymes that are the fuel for the Alcohol Dehydrogenase (ADH) enzyme to process alcohol.
Recoverthol has been specifically designed to be added to alcoholic drinks so that these cofactors and co-enzymes can reach the ADH enzyme at the same time as alcohol.
 


 
We are dedicated to educating people about how to look after yourself whilst you get the most out of life. We all like to let our hair down from time to time and enjoy the company of friends over a few drinks.
Recoverthol was formulated to assist in preventing hangover symptoms before they begin, allowing you to enjoy yourself and to get the most out of the next day.  
 
Why use Recoverthol?
Recoverthol is superior and more convenient in comparison to other hangover products because:

It has a unique delivery method which involves SNAPPING and SQUEEZING a small liquid supplement into a drink.
The formulation is clear, and when added to alcohol it is odourless and tasteless. It will not affect the taste of your drink.
Recoverthol is taken when you start drinking (not before or after) so that you can get ahead of your hangover symptoms before they even begin. 
No additional fillers. 
Each dose is a small 2ml liquid vial that can easily fit into your pocket or handbag. 
Recoverthol is TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration - Australia) listed and manufactured in Australia in a TGA and FDA approved facility to ensure the ingredients and manufacturing processes are of the highest quality and standard.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that Recoverthol may assist in reducing the symptoms of Asian flush (alcohol flush syndrome).

 
Encouraging a responsible drinking culture
Recoverthol is a hangover management product in one sense, but it’s also about giving you the tools to better manage your drinking habits.  We have created a free (drinks calculator) mobile app (for iOS and android users) that is a great tool for encouraging you to learn more about and improve your drinking habits.  
                                         
The Recoverthol App is a self-quantifying tool that you can use to predict the effect of alcoholic beverages on your body (based on weight and gender) prior to drinking.  It keeps a track of how many standard drinks you have consumed so that you can stick to recommended safe drinking guidelines. 
The app also calculates the time to sober so that the user can estimate what time they would need to stop drinking in order to be sober for work the next day OR to allow for a good night’s sleep.
Did you know that if a 60kg female drinks two glasses of white wine, it will take over six hours to clear out of her body?  Try the app for yourself today.

The potential upside of learning more about your drinking habits and using a product like Recoverthol is being able to boost your productivity the next day.  No one likes to waste the day after having a few drinks the night before and this is where Recoverthol can be a game-changer in improving both well-being and productivity.

Recoverthol has a number of trademarks and patents that protect the intellectual property of the product and its delivery method.
 
Recoverthol in the Media
Check out the following National Nine news story about Recoverthol. Channel Nine is a major commercial free-to-air network in Australia.

 
Recoverthol has also received the Thumbs Up award from Mum Central, Australia’s premier lifestyle hub for women with a love for parenting and lifestyle, beauty and fashion, food and travel.

It fits over the thumb, index, and middle finger while leaving the other fingers and part of the hand uncovered. With the use of Neomano, people with hand paralysis have the ability to move their fingers in order to perform daily activities like hold and drink a cup of water, brush their teeth, or turn a doorknob to open a door. It does this by providing active grasp to maintain grip, followed by passive release. Neomano helps people gain independence and confidence in performing everyday tasks.   Who can use Neomano​? The Neomano is helpful for people with movement in their wrist and arm but little to no strength in their hands. This includes people who suffer from hand paralysis due to spinal cord injury (SCI), stroke, Lou Gehrig's disease (ALS), multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy and nerve injury. Please note that the range of product use may differ by the diagnosis and individual hand function. Learn more.  How does Neomano affect your life?

 Expert TestimonialsUlisses Jara-Manual, Rachel’s Therapist  ""When I first saw the Neomano device, I just immediately thought it would be helpful for somebody like Rachel. My hope with the glove is that she is going to eventually gain a whole lot more dexterity. Being able to pick up things with more ease is gonna be really significant. So now with this Neomano device, she can do more detailed stuff with her hands.""  
Kenneth Noto, Mark’s Therapist.  ""This (Neomano) will help him and enable him to hold onto things and let go without him using that voluntary contraction that has become weak. That's really an aid to his disability."" Lauren Sheehan, Occupational Therapist  ""It's been interesting because it's so individualized. We can't guess at what the patients would potentially be able to use the tool for. From very simple activities in daily living like eating, taking a top off of a container that they use, golfing, and using it for exercise. You know the activities that are fun. Again, we're bringing it to their lives."" Why Neomano? First, Neomano allows people to do a variety of everyday tasks with a single device. Daily tasks can be difficult for people that don't have full functionality from their hand, which is why many rely on assistive devices or caregivers. Neomano allows people to return to their daily-living activities and hobbies. Second, with the wide-array of functional uses, Neomano boosts confidence. The grasp pattern provides the independence needed to perform tasks single-handedly, allowing people to move forward with their lives. Third, the Neomano design is comfortable enoughto be worn in multiple types of situations. The partial glove design allows tactile sensory input to part of the palm and exposed fingers, and the leather allows for flexibility needed for everyday tasks. Neomano can be used by people both in the comfort of their own homes and in public.   The Red Dot Design Award is the world’s largest design competition.The Red Dot : Best of the Best is awarded for groundbreaking design and is the top prize.  
In the PRESS​   Neomano Components  
Three fingers + aluminum splint on the thumb to enable different degrees of gripping strength. With the aluminum splint on the thumb, the position of the thumb can be easily manipulated. The index and middle finger can also be adjusted to form a C-shaped grip for larger objects, and a pinch grip for smaller objects. The motor allows the fingers to bend and provide various degrees of gripping strength, along with passive release.  
Index finger assistive strap helps prevent ankylosis (stiffening). The glove is equipped with an assistive strap, made of neoprene fabric, on the back of the index finger to adjust the degree of tension. This helps people who suffer from finger stiffening maintain a better hand position for functional use.  

Anti-slip silicone coating on the palm + fingers. The silicone coat on the palm and fingers helps provide a firmer grip on objects and prevents slipping. 

Partial glove design. The exposed fingers and palm were designed to provide tactile sensory input.
  

Actuation of the motor and pulley. The Bluetooth wireless remote control (not pictured) enables the grip and release of the Neomano, powered by 3 AAA batteries that hook into the glove via the motor. When activated, the Grip button flexes the fingers to provide a gripping gesture. The Release button loosens the wires, allowing the hand to return to its original neutral position. The wire is highly elastic, which helps maintain wire integrity despite repetitive winding and loosening. 

Magnets make motor attachment and detachment simple. When the glove is not being used and powered by the motor, the motor can easily be detached by carefully pulling it away from the magnets on the glove. This allows people to easily transition from active to passive use of the glove. 

Power source for pairing with Bluetooth remote control. The power source has a button. The button will pair the Bluetooth remote control to the motor for wireless control of the glove. 
  
Wireless bluetooth remote control directs movement of the glove. The Grip button will activate the wires within the glove to begin to wind and will create a tighter grip the longer its held down. The Release button loosens the wires, which allows the hand to return to it's original neutral position.   
Arm bands to secure power supply to glove. Two arm bands help to securely and comfortably attach the power supply to the glove. The extra arm band can be used to secure the Bluetooth remote control, if desired.    Neomano Size Chart

<ul><li>The advantage of collaborating and participating in this experience is to give the opportunity to those living in today´s stressful society,  for a return to a simple and healthful environment of nature at a very economical price.</li></ul>
<ul><li>I invite you to experience a few days of peace away from the noise, with the possibility of enjoying the scenery, food and especially having time for yourself.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Universal changes begin from within, from the being that dwells in each one of us, without affiliation of any particular religion or belief. No external teachings will show us who we really are. It's just a matter of personal experience in silence, and beyond words..</li></ul>

<h3>With your contribution, the house will become a reality</h3>
<ul>
<li>Carrying out the Andean  Mountain House project involves challenges due to the economic situation in Venezuela today, which actually helps in the realization of this project. </li>
<li>I hope to achieve the goal with the support of people who are, like me, convinced that we must rethink life in a different way. </li>
<li>It is well worth investing in this way of life, which is ever harder to find in today´s world.</li>
</ul>
<ul><li>All expenses will be recorded via receipts, which will be available to contributors.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other ways you can help</h3>

</div></div>","My name is Antonio Marcano and I would like to build a Bed & Breakfast made of adobe, which will be an ideal place for relaxation any time of year. This will be a place where you can enjoy the tranquility in the locale, with  a library and meditation room, as well as,the benefit of healthy food  and excursions in the surrounding national parks of the state of Merida.
 
For the realization of the Andean Casamontaña project, $ 4000 (or equivalent in euros) is required to acquire the following:

Purchase and transport of 8 Mt3 of stone
Purchase and transport of 1500 adobe bricks
Wood for the structure and roof.
Materials for sanitary facilities
Materials for electrical installations
Materials for blacksmithing and carpentry
Materials for frieze, painting and finishing

 Casamontaña Andina: A model of life

The advantage of collaborating and participating in this experience is to give the opportunity to those living in today´s stressful society,  for a return to a simple and healthful environment of nature at a very economical price.
I invite you to experience a few days of peace away from the noise, with the possibility of enjoying the scenery, food and especially having time for yourself.
Universal changes begin from within, from the being that dwells in each one of us, without affiliation of any particular religion or belief. No external teachings will show us who we really are. It's just a matter of personal experience in silence, and beyond words..
 


With your contribution, the house will become a reality

Carrying out the Andean  Mountain House project involves challenges due to the economic situation in Venezuela today, which actually helps in the realization of this project. 
I hope to achieve the goal with the support of people who are, like me, convinced that we must rethink life in a different way. 
It is well worth investing in this way of life, which is ever harder to find in today´s world.

All expenses will be recorded via receipts, which will be available to contributors.
 

Other ways you can help

Spread and share comments about the project. For example, you could use the Indiegogo tools to do so.
Donate furniture, materials or tools that you no longer use (if you live in Venezuela).
Your positive thoughts and moral support are very important to me.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Alexander Foundation will launch a benefit corporation in January 2018, aimed at improving the student athlete experience and strengthen communities by providing programming that stimulates the mind and character. Purpose will partner with current youth serving facilities to conduct events -blended workshops and didactic offerings- that are designed to equip students with the skills needed to succeed in the classroom, athletics and in life.Our ImpactBusiness ModelSelf-sustaining through income earned from Purpose conducted/sponsored events.                  There are approximately 188 non-scheduled school days annually for students in Lancaster County. Purpose, will conduct events during these periods for students seeking to improve their academic and athletic skill sets. In addition to the normal rental fees paid for use of facilities, Purpose will donate 20% of event proceeds to the facilities for their respective youth programming. Profit sharing with youth serving facilities, is an incentive that no organization is currently providing to facilities in the area. This supplemental income from events, will help provide organizations the needed assistance as they navigate through their respective budget deficits due to year over year reduction in available funding for non-profits in the area. “It takes a village” and our inter-connectedness can bridge the gap of many non-school days that present a challenge relative to unproductive time for our students.Purpose will offer an innovative blend of social benefit and financial revenues from events that will cover cost and grow operations! Year 1 (2018) Financial Projections:
Total Revenues - $303K
68% Profit Margin
Provide 3 full time thriving wage jobs 
Service 1,805 student athletes over a span of 26 Events (during the 188 non-scheduled school days)
A study conducted by Harvard and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found that 26 percent of all parents hope their children become professional athletes.Youth sports is a $15 billion-dollar industry. Parents over-rely on athletic talents to deliver a lucrative future versus a balanced focus that includes academics and character development. How do we change the narrative? Athletics is not the only way to success. Athletics coupled with  the transformative power of education must be realized by students and their families. Over the last two years we’ve taught our curriculum to hundreds of student athletes, many of whom are repeat participants in our events. Our methodology began with personal experience as a collegiate athlete and volunteering (“lift as I climb”); evolved through trial and error via didactic and athletic programs offered – yielding feedback from participants, parents and the public. The outpouring of support is proof-positive; this is programming that will fulfill an un-met need.  The Visionary Behind PurposeWhat’s in it for you? Perks!Well, the biggest perk is that you'll help us acquire the resources necessary to enrich the lives of more student athletes in the community! Your contribution level will allow visible partnership opportunities as well as display your commitment to a program that positively impacts the community.If there is any other way that we could show our gratitude that you would appreciate, do not hesitate to let us know! Similarly, if you would like to donate but prefer anonymity, simply use the “Back it” button to specify the amount.What are some other ways you can help?Share our story. Please help spread the word by sharing this campaign!We also accept other kinds of donations, such as new or gently use athletic equipment and free or reduced-price attendance at athletic events and activities, that might prove interesting and instructive for the student athletes. In connection with such donations, please write to us at info@talexanderfoundtaion.org.If you would like to receive updates about our activities, you can sign up to our newsletter here (www.pddita.com).We are raising $30,000!Your investment in Purpose will go towards:
$10,000 Infrastructure Development
$10,000 Curriculum Development (licensing, editorial reviews, creation of curriculum app) 
$5,000 Academic Equipment (3 laptops, 1 projector, 8 portable whiteboards)
$3,000 Marketing (flyers, posters, Facebook ads, school visits)
$2,000 Professional Services (legal, accounting, and other start up administrative services)
If we exceed our funding goal, our plan is to:
Add more interactive features to the app being developed for the delivery of our curriculum;
Purchase newer athletic equipment!

Dokido’s wheel design holds the board in a neutral position that doesn’t move without the rider’s intention.

Dokido translates to “the way of synchronization,” getting its name from a combination of the Japanese words doki, meaning “synchronization,” and do, the word for “way,” like Judo or Aikido. With its specially-designed singular rear wheel, riders rock back and forth to get moving, offering lots of fun and a workout that tones the legs and core.  The motion of shifting weight forwards (brings eccentric hub at the top position) and backwards (brings the eccentric hub at the down position) between feet forces the patented rear wheel system to turn the wheel one complete revolution forward.  The Dokido board is made out of 8 layers of bamboo with a carbon fiber bottom layer to add extra strength. The board also includes a built-in stopping mechanism using side bumpers that force the wheel to stop when Dokido is tilted to the side. The bumpers also allow for indoor use as it does not scratch floors or walls. ""The Red Dots”""Simple Black Logo""Aircraft grade aluminum shafts & hubs, solid hand cast molded polyurethane wheel for extra durability  The traditional skateboard has been a beloved mode of exercise and entertainment for decades, but many beginners find it hard to step on a board and enjoy the ride without losing control. Dokido’s wheel design holds the board in a neutral position that doesn’t move without the rider’s intention. Instead of a freely-rolling board that requires riders to push off from the pavement, Dokido’s one-of-a-kind Saucerang System propels the board forward through a rider's dancing movement. When a rider isn’t actively rocking to move forward, the board keeps still, reducing the risk of injury. Not only is this longboard alternative a fun and easy way for beginners to enjoy the sport, but longtime-boarders will love the new challenge that comes with it.

<p>Let's test for Lyme is a crowd funding campaign that will raise funds to enable me to finish our urinary diagnostic test for Lyme Disease - a beautiful lady has suggested we campaign again and then the Lyme community can donate and feel part of the solution.</p>
<p>We're a small team committed to making a difference to the Lyme community. We need to finish the tests and validate our findings via clinical trials and quality &amp; regulatory approval in Europe and the USA.</p>
<p>If we can raise funds and commercialize the tests, we can achieve the following things;</p>
<p>Provide patients and clinicians with a direct detection method for borrelia,</p>
<p>Provide a solution to test for Lyme disease earlier before the disease becomes chronic,</p>
<p>Ensure the tests are cost effective and available to all globally.</p>
<p>Provide data to generate further understanding of this disease and how it is possibly linked to other neuroimmunological diseases.</p>
<p>Provide funding for patients via a charity to pay for their Lyme Disease diagnostics and treatments.</p>
<p>Create further awareness, educational and research programmes for clinicians and patients on a global basis.</p>
<p>There are currently in excess of 25,000 fundraising campaigns for patients with Lyme disease to help them pay for their treatment, as Senator Bernie Sanders has commented, ""No 'one in America should have to choose between their medicine and their food, yet millions are having to make that choice everyday"". This is inexcusable and nobody on a global basis should have to make this choice.</p>

<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Diagnostic development is very expensive, but there are few teams developing a test that can actually make a difference.  Any donation would be greatly received and will get us one step closer to releasing these much needed tests. We're not tied to a university or college, we don't owe any money, it's just us..... that's how we like it!</p>
<p>I can't share the exact science, but it is a method that our team have used successfully before. What is important here is that there are not many other research projects looking specifically at developing a diagnostic for Lyme disease. </p>
<p>We are  a specialist team that have the knowledge, determination and skills to get it to the commercial market, where it can be used - there is limited risk as we have the best chance of releasing this to the market this way subject to quality and regulatory approval, which is out of our control.  As someone very wise suggested to me, even failures are ways of moving forward. We have invested heavily in this project and have the commitment and drive to make this work.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>As many of the Lyme disease community knows, Lyme disease is a tick borne illness caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi.</p>
<p>Lyme Disease is the fastest growing infectious bacterial disease in the USA.  It is twice as common as breast cancer and 6 times as common as Aids</p>
<p>Current Estimates of cases in the US equate to 1m new cases per year with costs the US  healthcare systems between 712m and 1.3b USD per year.  These costs do not include out of pocket expenses which are reported as being in excess of $53,000 per patient and often most families will have more than one family member affected by this deadly disease.  These costs also do not include the additional medical examinations, physician appointments and pharmaceuticals that are dispensed to patients with Lyme disease when they are misdiagnosed with other chronic illnesses such as CFS, Parkinson's AZD, and multiple sclerosis for example, causing further complications as the Lyme disease is missed, the disease becomes chronic and further damage is done.</p>
<p>Current Estimates of cases in Europe are rapidly reaching six figures, with 1.5 million cases being reported in Germany.</p>
<p>By 2020 due to climate change, 28 million people will have been exposed to deer ticks, placing them at a major risk of contracting Lyme disease.</p>
<p>Richard Horowitz, a well respected Lyme medical doctor has reported that the Chinese CDC has indicated that there are 83 million cases of Lyme disease in China.</p>
<p>In Australia, the Griffin University national center for neuroimmunology and emerging disease has indicated that there are at least 460,000 cases of Lyme disease.</p>
<p>The impact of this disease is astounding, currently the recommended two tiered testing is not effective.</p>
<p><strong>"" Our development of a urinary Lyme diagnostic test in several formats will facilitate early antibiotic therapy and significantly decrease complications and costs from the Lyme disease infection on a world wide basis""</strong></p>
<p> Risks &amp; Challenges</p>
<p>All scientific projects are risky, but we feel it depends upon how you view risk, it is less risky if we have an opportunity to get these tests to the market, make a difference to the medical and Lyme community, raise further awareness and importantly raise funds so that we can further directly help Lyme patients.  As a Lyme disease sufferer, how would you feel if you could ring or write to a charity and say, ""here's my medical expenses"" and the voice at the end of the phone says ""don't worry, we'll pay those for you""  That's our intention - if we can get the tests to market, we'll have the funds to be able to do that.</p>

When there is intense light (eg. The sun), our brain stops producing melatonin and sends serotonin into the body, which makes us feel energized.    How light affects our brain Come Autumn and Winter, when there is little natural light, our brain tends to continue producing Melatonin, a sleep inducing hormone, even daytime. Result : we feel tired and our mood is somber.   A patented optical technology Luminette® uses a patented innovative optical technology: placed above eyesight, its beam of light is angled top-down, just as happens naturally under blue skies and allows user to keep their vision free. Luminette Glasses emits blue-enriched white light wavelengths peaked at 470 nm. This wavelength is the most effective at simulating sunlight and will trigger the body’s beneficial effects in response to the simulated sunlight.           Because we know you have no time to lose, especially in the morning, we designed Luminette Glasses.Wear it while you brush your teeth, eat breakfast, or work on your computer. And thanks to its long-lasting battery, enjoy it outside your home: at work or even on airplanes.      And in many other marketing media        We are a young and dynamic team, driven by a passion for improvement and a desire to create the best product ever. We worked hard to create Luminette Glasses 3 and we are really proud to present it to you now.We aim to help people feel better thanks to light therapy. Our team is small but we believe that everyone has something special to bring, which makes our team very unique but also close.   Luminette came out in 2006 after 4 years of research at the University of Liege (Belgium). It is the result of collaboration between two fields of research : sleep medicine and optical physics.  A team of inventors and scientific advisors The inventors took a simple observation as their starting point : light therapy boxes are effective but inconvenient.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Michael Lussambo, I'm a movement and health specialist, a former track and bobsleigh athlete, and a college graduate. I also served in the Swiss military as an officer. I'm 33 years old and I live in Baar in the canton of Zug, Switzerland. </p>
<p>I'm the founder of 'MikeFit - Health is wealth' a personal training studio in Baar/ZG and '<strong>SWISSBODY - TRAIN MEASURE ANALYZE</strong>'. </p>
<p>At the MikeFit Fitness centre in Baar, Switzerland, we worked with EMS suits a lot. That meant we had to dump a lot too and the discipline I learned from my service couldn't accept that level of waste. With the complaints of my clients on my mind, we set out to do something about it.</p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564657568/sq8hzikg10ejbxurmuni.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We started by observing the advantages and disadvantages of various EMS suits. While collecting this data, we also started looking for the best solutions to the problems we were beginning to find out now that we were in observation mode. </p>
<p>We documented plenty of weak points in the practical use of the suits on a daily basis. These weak points inspired us to work on a solution and develop a suit that is not lacking in responsiveness and robustness, whilst promising longevity and washability, with <strong>at least a 5-year warranty</strong>. </p>
<p>One of the most common challenges with the existing suits are the electronic contacts which quickly lose their power, resulting in an inability to train the whole body evenly and efficiently after only a short period of time. </p>
<p><strong>We believe that it is time for a suit that can support the process of muscle gain and more intensive training, not only passively, but actively.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Smart Textiles</h3>
<p>These requirements require the use of smart textiles. With these, we can create a suit which is <strong>suitable for more intensive training units and even more muscle gain</strong>. The suit supports the training units with 18 separately controllable pads placed on the most relevant muscles. With <strong>Electronic Muscle Stimulation (EMS)</strong>, every muscle with a pad will be trained to its own limit. </p> <p>Additionally, the suit analyses the <strong>bioelectrical impedance (BIA)</strong> and makes <strong>electromyography (EMG)</strong>. With this information, a training unit can be intensified to maximum effectiveness and full potential can be reached.</p> <p>Based on these findings, we initiated a research project in cooperation with the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland, to develop a suit that meets our expectations and the standards expected by our clients at Mikefit.</p> <p>✅<strong>Faster Calorie Burn:</strong> With our new systems, you reach the aerobic threshold earlier and lost weight within a short period.. </p>
<p>✅<strong>Time-Saving:</strong> When you can achieve more in a workout in less time, then you have more time for family and relaxation. </p>
<p>✅<strong>Comfortable And Light:</strong> We achieved this by using an innovative nanomaterial and structure. </p>
<p>✅<strong>AI-Based Individually Optimised Training:</strong> Our training programmes are usually adapted to each body differently. With the suits, we used a highly developed Artificial Intelligence. </p>
<p>✅<strong>Durable Despite Stress: </strong>We wanted a suit that is not continuously losing its electrode contacts whether during use or laundry. </p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Boulder Trainer Next Level Update</h2>
<p>Today Boulder Trainer has more users than I expected. I already upgraded the server in 2017 and hired a freelance developer to help me to update the web interface and the iPhone app. But there are so much more potential improvements, which would make Boulder Trainer a better app and help to build a real community of passionate climbers and boulderer. ​</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517317574/hpiujz5jeue6tc22zcem.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">No monthly payments</h3>
<p>The app is not for free, but with a single purchase, the user gets a lifetime access to the app updates and free access to the web interface. Maintaining all this tech, can't be financed with the current pay-once-get-all-access price model. Like many other app providers, there is actually a monthly subscription plan required to provide the best user experience.</p>
<p>But with a completely new developed app and web app it would be possible to move everything to Firebase. </p>
<p>Firebase is much cheaper than a single fast server and it provides faster access to everyone due to a clever CDN network capability. And most important: it is a scalable solution without the hassle maintaining a complex server.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Roadmap</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517228992/z56cqhfzyfx259p35lue.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Estimated Expenses</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517230521/cui1urldntxsglgst5az.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">FAQ</h2>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why don't you just upgrade to a bigger server?</h3>
<p>The traffic volume has come to a point, where it's not efficient anymore to rent just a better (and more expensive) server. Those servers, cost much more per year, as the app sales generate profit. And monthly subscription plan is not the best solution for a niche app. Also a bigger server does not solve the problem, that users from all over the world have to access a server in Germany.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">
<br/>Why don't you rent a server in a different country?</h3>
<p>Moving one server to another country does not solve the problem. People from all over the world need to have fast access to BT Online and not just a few from one country.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">
<br/>How long will it take to update BT-Online?</h3>
<p>Switching to a cloud-based solution does not only require to update BT-Online (web app). It also means that the iPhone app and the Android app have to be updated. The estimated time-frame is five months for all.</p>
<p>Starting in April, I will give the screen Design to the developer as a guideline to follow. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks and Challenges</h2>
<p>Although the apps and web interface are already available there is still a long way to go for the next level update.</p>

<p>The beta testing will be done using Test Flight by Apple for beta access to the app before the release. Apple has set a limit to 10,000 users for three months. So it is not guaranteed that everyone gets the beta version access. But only in case, we reach this high limit.</p>
</div></div>","Boulder Trainer Next Level Update
Today Boulder Trainer has more users than I expected. I already upgraded the server in 2017 and hired a freelance developer to help me to update the web interface and the iPhone app. But there are so much more potential improvements, which would make Boulder Trainer a better app and help to build a real community of passionate climbers and boulderer. ​

No monthly payments
The app is not for free, but with a single purchase, the user gets a lifetime access to the app updates and free access to the web interface. Maintaining all this tech, can't be financed with the current pay-once-get-all-access price model. Like many other app providers, there is actually a monthly subscription plan required to provide the best user experience.
But with a completely new developed app and web app it would be possible to move everything to Firebase. 
Firebase is much cheaper than a single fast server and it provides faster access to everyone due to a clever CDN network capability. And most important: it is a scalable solution without the hassle maintaining a complex server.
Roadmap

Estimated Expenses

FAQ
Why don't you just upgrade to a bigger server?
The traffic volume has come to a point, where it's not efficient anymore to rent just a better (and more expensive) server. Those servers, cost much more per year, as the app sales generate profit. And monthly subscription plan is not the best solution for a niche app. Also a bigger server does not solve the problem, that users from all over the world have to access a server in Germany.

Why don't you rent a server in a different country?
Moving one server to another country does not solve the problem. People from all over the world need to have fast access to BT Online and not just a few from one country.

How long will it take to update BT-Online?
Switching to a cloud-based solution does not only require to update BT-Online (web app). It also means that the iPhone app and the Android app have to be updated. The estimated time-frame is five months for all.
Starting in April, I will give the screen Design to the developer as a guideline to follow. 
 
Risks and Challenges
Although the apps and web interface are already available there is still a long way to go for the next level update.
The timeframe is very tight. Up to three months additional time may be needed to develop additional features we may get suggest during this time. Should any issues arise, we'll keep you updated every step of the way.

<h3>Who's The Man Behind The Curtain?</h3>
<p>I am an Alligator Wresting, Bull Running, Volcano Climbing, Entrepreneur that sees a major opportunity to improve our health with the launch of Black Label Nutrition. I am a former Marine that served two tours to Afghanistan, was awarded the Bronze Star for heroism and Purple Heart for a small bullet wound, and was later named Marine of the Year for my leadership. If that doesn't get you excited, I got out of the military and earned my MBA in Finance from California's number 2 business school and graduated with honors, am training to climb Everest, and was once a national champion in TaeKwonDo. So, who is the man behind the curtain? I'm just some guy that loves life, wants to experience it all, and leave this world in a better place than when I came into it. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Do I Need Your Help?</h3>
<p>I am going up against an army of 800 pound gorillas in the nutrition industry. These industry titans have made it nearly impossible for newcomers, like me, to be successful and give consumers quality supplements. Did you know there have been several class action lawsuits against many of the largest supplement companies for not actually having any protein in their protein supplements?! My jaw hit the floor when I read that the first time. But they continue to peddle their dirt and make billions by taking advantage of you for not being a freaking chemist and testing their product. With your help, we can launch Black Label Nutrition and start making an impact in the industry! Giving consumers high quality, great tasting, protein that they can toss in their carryon or gym bag and enjoy whenever or wherever they want is only the first step. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Am I Doing With The Money?</h3>
<p>We are ready to start manufacturing! We have the product, we have the packaging, we just need your help to get the factory line moving! In manufacturing you have something called Minimum Order Quantities (MOQ's), the more I can make in a single batch, the cheaper I can sell it to you! Your help now, means you'll get the best nutrition possible, for cheaper! It's a win, win. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Let's be honest, there is the possibility that one of the big multi-billion dollar companies will try to mimic my product and push us out of business. How do I beat that risk? Easy. I will continuously deliver the highest quality product and customer service to our clients so it stays impossible to truly mimic our great company. They can have cool packaging like us, they may even decide to stop being cheap and invest into better quality ingredients, but they will never be us. I've fought in war and went back for seconds.. I'm not worried about some old guys in suits. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<h3><strong>What makes this toothbrush so special?</strong></h3>
<p>We are introducing a lightweight and waterproof electric toothbrush stuffed with cool features. A toothbrush that is both intelligent and beautifully designed. To shoot the campaign we've used a fully working prototype. </p>
<h3>Features:</h3>
<p><strong>Two high-frequency vibration modes</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/h1LjI1YBebK4eM2bEP/giphy.gif"" src=""""/> </p>
<p>The powerful motor provides high-frequency vibrations. There are two modes: normal mode with 33.000 vibrations per minute and turbo mode with 35.000 vibrations. The vibrating brush thoroughly cleans your teeth and gums in these modes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Time notifications</strong></p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/xlLcP1NBo7Hnfv6eKp/giphy.gif"" src=""""/><p> </p>
<p>The vibrations pause for a moment after 30 seconds to remind you to switch to another quarter section of your teeth. After four sections of 30 seconds, you have reached the duration of 2 minutes and the vibrations stop. This helps you to adhere to the dentist-recommended brushing time of two minutes.</p> <p><strong>Comfortable grip</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1630506663/ubub2unmcenj06irzpjx.png"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>The aluminum body is pleasant to hold due to the cylinder shape with a diameter of 2,5cm/1in.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Lightweight</strong></p>

<p>With a total weight (including a brush head) of 152g/0,3lb, it feels like a feather in your hand, and provides optimal comfort while brushing. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Compatible with all USB-C charging cables</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1630507667/opagwok87m7k7amtll29.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>To charge the battery, simply screw off the bottom and plug in the included USB-C cable. You can use the charging cable of your smartphone. Save space when travelling, because you don't need to bring an extra USB-C cable. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Compatible with brush heads of other brands</strong></p>

<p>The Electric Toothbrush will be delivered with two extra brush heads. To create flexibilty, you can attach brush heads of other major brands (such as Philips Sonicare) onto our toothbrush. Wherever you are in the world, you'll be able to find new brush heads that fit.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Upright design</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/o8sCF3AuLgJL6vjwlV/giphy.gif"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>The flat bottom<i> </i>allows the toothbrush to stand upright, taking up little space in your bathroom or kitchen. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Auto-stop after two minutes</strong></p>

</div><p> </p><p> </p></div>","What makes this toothbrush so special?
We are introducing a lightweight and waterproof electric toothbrush stuffed with cool features. A toothbrush that is both intelligent and beautifully designed. To shoot the campaign we've used a fully working prototype. 
Features:
Two high-frequency vibration modes
 
The powerful motor provides high-frequency vibrations. There are two modes: normal mode with 33.000 vibrations per minute and turbo mode with 35.000 vibrations. The vibrating brush thoroughly cleans your teeth and gums in these modes.
 
Time notifications
 
The vibrations pause for a moment after 30 seconds to remind you to switch to another quarter section of your teeth. After four sections of 30 seconds, you have reached the duration of 2 minutes and the vibrations stop. This helps you to adhere to the dentist-recommended brushing time of two minutes. Comfortable grip

The aluminum body is pleasant to hold due to the cylinder shape with a diameter of 2,5cm/1in.
 
Lightweight

With a total weight (including a brush head) of 152g/0,3lb, it feels like a feather in your hand, and provides optimal comfort while brushing. 
 
Compatible with all USB-C charging cables

To charge the battery, simply screw off the bottom and plug in the included USB-C cable. You can use the charging cable of your smartphone. Save space when travelling, because you don't need to bring an extra USB-C cable. 
 
Compatible with brush heads of other brands
 
The Electric Toothbrush will be delivered with two extra brush heads. To create flexibilty, you can attach brush heads of other major brands (such as Philips Sonicare) onto our toothbrush. Wherever you are in the world, you'll be able to find new brush heads that fit.  
 
Upright design

The flat bottom allows the toothbrush to stand upright, taking up little space in your bathroom or kitchen. 
 
Auto-stop after two minutes
 
The vibrations stop after 2 minutes, as this is the most common time to brush your teeth. If you would like to to brush longer, simply push the button again. 
 
Remembers last chosen mode for the next time  
The toothbrush remembers the vibration mode that you used last time. The next time it will start in the same vibration mode. To switch to the other mode, push the button once.
IPX7 waterproof
 
The toothbrush can be used while taking a shower or a bath, without water doing any damage to it. The IPX7 water resistance rating enables safe cleaning of the toothbrush with water. 
 
Colors
The toothbrush is available in two colors: white and antracite. Choose your favorites.

Usually, if there is a second person there, it is a person of approximately the same age as the victim. When you run a study where the age distribution approximates that of the victims, you get radically different results than most studies: About one in six can perform ten minutes of chest compressions with their hands on a CPR manikin - and a CPR manikin is typically about 40 to 80% as stiff as the average adult's chest. More than sixty percent can perform chest compressions with their heel. The principal factor influencing survival from a cardiac arrest is the immediate and continuous performance of CPR from the time of the arrest until the ambulance crew is hands on at the victim.</p>
<p>I'm a business executive who fixed broken companies. In my retirement I got my Paramedic licenses in two states, rode the ambulances, and worked night shifts in the Emergency Department at the local Level One Trauma Center. I was outraged by what I learned. </p>
<p>We've trained more than 10,000 people in Chatham County, Georgia. We're about to take this program throughout North America. </p>
<p>What's in it for you? You have a 10% chance of seeing - in your lifetime - at least one cardiac arrest. And when that happens, the victim's future hinges on your ability to recognize what's happening, do something about it, and keep on doing that until the ambulance crew takes over.</p>
<p>The people with whom you spend most of your time also have that approximately ten percent chance of seeing someone arrest...and the one they see arrest might be you.</p>
<p>What to do? Get all the people you spend time with trained in Bystander CPR, AED use, choking emergencies, and stroke recognition. Our class videos are at <a href=""http://www.slicc.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.slicc.org</a> - just click on ""For past trainees"" in the left column. Those videos - particularly the Adult CPR, the Stroke, and the AED videos - will do two things: First, they will teach you a practical way to save that family member or friend you might see arrest or have a stroke, and second, it will demonstrate why we need to upgrade the videos to something more professional.</p>
<p>We are a 501(c)(3) public charity, totally staffed by volunteers.</p>
<p>If we can roll this program out in North America, we can save perhaps 20% of the victims who currently die. That's 70,000 lives saved each year!</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <ul>
<li>You get immediate access to the existing class videos.</li>
<li>We get to professionally re-make the videos to conform to the AHA recommendations that will be released in October of 2015.</li>
<li>None of the money we raise will go to SLICC's personnel. Period. It will go to professional video producers who have already agreed to perform the work for less than half their normal rate.</li> <li>If we don't reach the entire goal, we'll only re-do some of the video segments. Adult CPR is first. Stroke is second.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I've worked on 53 cardiac arrest resuscitations in my brief career in emergency medicine.

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Heel compressions were an approved alternative in the 2005 AHA guidelines. It would be ideal if the AHA would put heel compressions into its Bystander Videos, and the interest appears to be there.

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>We are a group of 10 medical students who will be traveling to rural Ethiopia in order to train local healthcare professionals in Ultrasound Technology. In a country where close to 80% of the population have no access to healthcare, this accurate, safe, and low-maintenance diagnostic tool will sustainably improve patient healthcare.</p>

<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; Why</h3> <p>Our team is raising money to donate two ultrasound devices, provide food and supplies for Ethiopian children, and to teach ultrasound in Soddo Christian Hospital.  We hope that by donating 2 machines, the curriculum we teach will have broader effects and benefit more patients. </p>
<p>Our school is only able to cover about 20% of our total budget, so your contribution will be a tremendous help! </p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Thanks to our school's strong ultrasound curriculum,
and donors like you, we will be able to teach future and current doctors how to
incorporate ultrasound into their practice. </p>
<p>Ultrasound is a safe tool and does not use any radiation. It is also an accurate and <i>portable</i> tool that has a broad range of applications and can be used for diagnostic imaging of for various different body systems (i.e.: your heart, or musculoskeletal system).</p>
<p>In addition to teaching an Ultrasound curriculum, we will translate this curriculum into the Ethiopian native language, Amharic, so that the students can gain a better understanding of the material and share it with other healthcare professionals in the area after we leave. </p>

Ethiopia has been a time-capsule of tradition -- the customs it holds have been there for centuries. But we are hopeful that we can adjust and learn to become sensitive to the natives' cultural norms through guidance from our sponsoring hospital, Soddo Christian Hospital, as well as one of our own team members who was born and raised in Ethiopia. </p>

<p>Greetings Everyone,</p>
<p>  My name is Levi
Pearson III, MD, MBA. I am a board certified Anesthesiologist specializing in
Interventional Pain Management and owner of Metropolitan Pain, P.A. I have 20
years’ experience of watching the evolution of medicine. In many ways medicine
has become both wiser and weaker. We have made great strides in technology, and
yet accessibility, convenience, and prosperity for both patients and physicians
may be lacking. Access to care with resultant improved health outcomes, as well
as physician and patient satisfaction have not kept pace with these advances. I
have heard the grievances of patients and physicians regarding the need for a
better way, and I am on a mission to assist in developing a solution.</p>
<p>  A means was
needed to assist me in merging my clinical medicine experience with the
business acumen needed to bring life to this venture. To this purpose I have
recently completed a cum laude executive MBA from the Rochester Institute of
Technology. At RIT I experienced an education enriched by classmates who were
all currently business executives who shared with me their valuable knowledge
of the intense focus needed to move a product from vision to successful implementation.
It’s time to make medicine all that it can be for both patients and doctors,
using all available technology to assure that no one is not connected to the
best of care. I am seeking to broaden my connection with people such as
yourself with like passions.</p>
<p>  Whether its
needing for mom to have independent regular visits to monitor her health, visual
check of a non-life threatening injury or early post op minor wound check that
may or may not need in office care, a prescription or follow-up when you just
cannot find the time or income for the full trip and visit, or simply the desire
to avoid a crowded waiting area, Vuewell health may be just what the doctor
ordered. In fact many doctors may see the benefit of developing or building
their practices with a set and steady flow of new revenue using the Vuewell
platform, and all the while offering an efficient and convenient way of
maintaining improved contact, compliance, and overall healthcare for their
patients.  </p>
<p>I am currently continuing to develop what I hope to be a
telemedicine platform that will be second to none. I am asking for your help
and support in an Indigogo crowdfunding effort to raise the capital necessary
to complete the development of my advanced platform product and enter the
market. My hope is to greatly improve and possibly even save the lives of
millions of patients present and future who require more efficient, convenient,
and cost effective healthcare access. Vuewell Health will pursue ongoing
evolution and development of a new, robust, and uniquely designed telemedicine platform
that will seek to become the gold standard for physicians and patients to
connect. In summary creating a <b><i>“virtual portal for optimal care”</i></b>.</p>

<p>The Verbo Church in Puerto Cabezas,
Nicaragua has a passion and a vision to
care for the poor in the nearby community
of Caminante. Caminante is home to
approximately 2000 people that are
displaced families from the interior jungle
areas of the North Atlantic Autonomous
Region.

<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Most of these families left the
impoverished jungle areas and headed to
the city of Puerto Cabezas in search of
jobs and hope. What they found was a
city with 80% unemployment, and without
many skills, they found it extremely difficult
to make a living. Not able to purchase
land or build suitable housing, these
families live as squatters on the edge of <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">town in pieced together wood and tin
“homes”. The only income many of these
families have is to sift through the local

For you, having immediate access to clean water isn't a big deal, right? For the children and volunteers at the Verbo Feeding Center, it is a big deal. 








The Verbo Church in Puerto Cabezas,
Nicaragua has a passion and a vision to
care for the poor in the nearby community
of Caminante. Caminante is home to
approximately 2000 people that are
displaced families from the interior jungle
areas of the North Atlantic Autonomous
Region. 
		
	
	
		





Most of these families left the
impoverished jungle areas and headed to
the city of Puerto Cabezas in search of
jobs and hope. What they found was a
city with 80% unemployment, and without
many skills, they found it extremely difficult
to make a living. Not able to purchase
land or build suitable housing, these
families live as squatters on the edge of town in pieced together wood and tin
“homes”. The only income many of these
families have is to sift through the local
garbage for recyclables and left over food
items. 
The Verbo Church partnered with Christian Fellow Church (CFC) in Ashburn, VA, Stop Hunger Now, and Orphan network to build a feeding center in Caminante.  The feeding center was built in 2012.









Some Facts: 

Caminante
is home to nearly 1200 at- risk children of whom nearly half live in extreme
poverty.

About 300 children in Nicaragua die each year from diarrhea caused by unsafe water and poor sanitation.





Project Details:
The project focuses on the overall master plan to supply and distribute water to the Verbo Feeding Center.





 Remove
the existing pump and flush out the existing well using the existing an air
compressor that has the ability to reach 90 psi.


 Reinstall
the well pump, using new electrical wire, rope, check valve and piping.


 Provide
a new well Cap. This cap will give the well a better seal to avoid debris from
falling into the well.


 Provide
a new well plug and pad.  The well plug
and pad will be only at the surface and be made of concrete.


 Provide
new electrical wiring from the breaker panel to the pump.


 Provide
a new tank base.  The tank base will be
located near the existing base, however this base will be approximately 10 to
12 feet high.  The tank base will be made
out of concrete.


To
give added pressure within the distribution system, we will add a new booster
pump and bladder tank. 


The
distribution system will be connected to the dual filter system.


The
distribution system will be made from 1-inch PVC and will connect to the
kitchen sinks, the children’s wash sink, laundry tub and include two yard
hydrants.  The placement of the hydrants
will be as directed by the Owner.




What We Need & What You Get With your help from the funds we raise, we can complete this water distribution project.  We need minimum $1,500 to be able to implement and complete it. We will use the funds to purchase materials for the systems, which will include PVC pipes, pipe connections (joints, elbows, etc.), valves, storage tanks, solar panels, batteries, etc, to be purchased in Nicaragua.  For every donation of a certain amount made, a perk will be available to express our gratitude for your donation!
  The Impact

Relaxing regularly can increase your chances of success.</span></p>
<p>This is because relaxation improves factors related to success including helping your concentration, focus and attention. You can learn faster and remember things better. You can have better, closer relationships and become more likeable because of increased empathy, compassion and patience. You can be more productive, have stronger willpower and be able to make decisions more quickly even under high-stress situations. Regular relaxation can also improve test results. </p>

Just think of Newton sitting contemplatively under an apple tree when he came across gravity, Archimedes stepping into his bath and declaring “Eureka” or Paul McCartney who dreamed of the melody to Yesterday while he was waking up. Relaxation leads to creativity by boosting brain function, increasing brain size which makes us smarter, improving problem solving skills and giving greater insight.</span></p>

Relaxing also slows down the aging process, keeps you thinner and improves skin.</span></p>

<p>Other health benefits from relaxing include lower blood pressure, a healthier heart, slower aging of the brain, lower heart attack risks, higher resilience and improved sleep quality.</p>

<p><b>The mask<br/></b>The soft cloth mask can be worn in the office, during flights and even to bed. The velcro strap means that the mask can fit any head size comfortably. You can easily wash the mask by opening it and removing the electronic component.</p>
<p><b>Color therapy LED lights</b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1374288/files/20150411073418-color_light_therapy_strip.jpg?1428762858"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The color LED lights are programmed to work exactly with the guided relaxation exercises. This means that they will work differently depending on the type of exercise. During an exercise aimed at helping you calm down and take you out of a stressful moment, the colors will be active at the beginning but will fade during the exercise. Then, a sunrise effect will help bring you back to the present in an improved mood. If the exercise is a longer one to help you fall asleep, instead, the lights will fade and will not come back on at the end of the exercise in order to allow you to move into deeper sleep without having to take the mask off.</span></p>

You can just put on the mask, choose the result you want to achieve and a voice will guide you as the lights work to protect you from outside stress triggers. Exercises for instant relaxation are designed to be 3 to 5 minutes long whereas those for sleep aid will last much longer. </span></p>
<p><b>Integrated headphones</b> <br/>The headphones in the mask are flat and comfortable so that they don’t interfere with your sensations whether you’re at the office and calming down or in bed trying to fall asleep.</p>

<p><b>Aromatherapy</b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1374291/files/20150411073548-aromatherapy_long.jpg?1428762948"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/></p>
<p>The aromatherapy strip will sit just inside of the mask above the nose which means that a very scant drop will be enough for several uses. The essential oils will be mixed in order to induce the mood you’re most in need of at that moment: happy, relax, concentration and energy. These mixtures will come from one of the highest quality suppliers in the US.</p>
<p><b>Powering the Personal Relaxation Pod<br/></b>The Pod will last for 7-10 hours before it needs to be recharged. Both the chip and the rechargeable battery will sit within the mask in a way that is nearly undetectable and which will not have any negative impact on your comfort. The mask is USB rechargeable and comes with an attachable wall plug so that you can charge it anywhere.</p>

The Personal Relaxation Pod combines guided audio, color LED light therapy and aromatherapy which draw your attention to positive present experiences while protecting you from all stressful surroundings. In just minutes, you’ll start to feel calmer and with regular use, you can improve your life in only three minutes a day.
Success, creativity, health and happiness

Some of the most successful people today including Rupert Murdoch, Oprah Winfrey, Arianna Huffington and Bill Ford know how to relax. Relaxing regularly can increase your chances of success.
This is because relaxation improves factors related to success including helping your concentration, focus and attention. You can learn faster and remember things better. You can have better, closer relationships and become more likeable because of increased empathy, compassion and patience. You can be more productive, have stronger willpower and be able to make decisions more quickly even under high-stress situations. Regular relaxation can also improve test results. 

Contrary to popular belief, true inspiration usually happens during moments of relaxation and not while hammering away at a solution to a problem. Just think of Newton sitting contemplatively under an apple tree when he came across gravity, Archimedes stepping into his bath and declaring “Eureka” or Paul McCartney who dreamed of the melody to Yesterday while he was waking up. Relaxation leads to creativity by boosting brain function, increasing brain size which makes us smarter, improving problem solving skills and giving greater insight.


People who relax regularly are healthier and look better! Their immune system is stronger, they get sick less often and when they do get sick, their symptoms aren’t as strong. Relaxing also slows down the aging process, keeps you thinner and improves skin.

Other health benefits from relaxing include lower blood pressure, a healthier heart, slower aging of the brain, lower heart attack risks, higher resilience and improved sleep quality.

People who know how to relax are happier. That’s because relaxing regularly helps you worry less, can make your moods more stable, brings about more positive feelings and increases self-esteem.


Your own personal spacewhenever and wherever you need it




This comfortable, stylish device was designed to be worn anywhere including:

in the office when you need an extra boost of concentration
at home when you just need some peace
whenever you need some calming relief
during long airplane travel 
during your commute to work on public transportation

Besides the 3 minute relaxation exercises, there is also the power nap option that helps you sleep for 15 minutes and then gently brings you back to an alert waking state as the LED lights simulate a sunrise, exercises to help you fall asleep at night and concentration improvement.

The science of meditation, aromatherapy and color light therapy
Although meditation is an age old practice, it has recently entered mainstream and been taken up in its secular form in order to help in a wide range of health areas including anxiety disorder, stress, depression and ADHD. Several recent studies have shown both the short term and long term benefits of taking up mindfulness meditation. The benefits are so positive that the Mayo Clinic released an article on using meditation to relieve stress quickly.
Color light therapy has been used for some time now to affect behavior and health including Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), jet lag, PMS, sleep disorders as well as calming violent outbreaks.
Aromatherapy, which is the use of essential oils to affect behavior or help other health problems, has also been tested in a long series of clinical studies. It is shown to help in a large range of areas including decreased anxiety, lower blood pressure, lower stress levels, improved brain activity and memory and even improved results in Alzheimer’s patients. 

What's in the kit

The maskThe soft cloth mask can be worn in the office, during flights and even to bed. The velcro strap means that the mask can fit any head size comfortably. You can easily wash the mask by opening it and removing the electronic component.
Color therapy LED lights
The color LED lights are programmed to work exactly with the guided relaxation exercises. This means that they will work differently depending on the type of exercise. During an exercise aimed at helping you calm down and take you out of a stressful moment, the colors will be active at the beginning but will fade during the exercise. Then, a sunrise effect will help bring you back to the present in an improved mood. If the exercise is a longer one to help you fall asleep, instead, the lights will fade and will not come back on at the end of the exercise in order to allow you to move into deeper sleep without having to take the mask off.
Guided relaxation exercises


The length of the exercises will depend on what you need. You can just put on the mask, choose the result you want to achieve and a voice will guide you as the lights work to protect you from outside stress triggers. Exercises for instant relaxation are designed to be 3 to 5 minutes long whereas those for sleep aid will last much longer. 
Integrated headphones The headphones in the mask are flat and comfortable so that they don’t interfere with your sensations whether you’re at the office and calming down or in bed trying to fall asleep.
The App
The app, which can also be used as a standalone, will be organized according to what you need so that using it is easy and intuitive. It will include sections on instant relaxation, improved concentration, power napping and sleep aid. It will work on both iOS and Android devices.
Aromatherapy
The aromatherapy strip will sit just inside of the mask above the nose which means that a very scant drop will be enough for several uses. The essential oils will be mixed in order to induce the mood you’re most in need of at that moment: happy, relax, concentration and energy. These mixtures will come from one of the highest quality suppliers in the US.
Powering the Personal Relaxation PodThe Pod will last for 7-10 hours before it needs to be recharged. Both the chip and the rechargeable battery will sit within the mask in a way that is nearly undetectable and which will not have any negative impact on your comfort. The mask is USB rechargeable and comes with an attachable wall plug so that you can charge it anywhere.

The Perks






Where we are and where we're going



We have agreements with an electronics company for the manufacturing of the chip.
The mask has undergone several upgrades during its short life.
We’ll be using one of the best suppliers in the US for essential oils.
Now we're ready to take the next steps: get the electronic component and mask manufactured and create a range of guided relaxation exercises with matching sounds and colors so that you can relax quickly and easily.",15.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p><p><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dearest
members of my friends and family, </a></p>
<p>I hope this letter finds all in the best of health &amp; spirits.</p>
<p>As a Palestinian in
the diaspora, many of you know that I’ve always been eager to find ways to give
back to our people and advance our cause in some of the best ways I knew how.
One of the nearest and dearest issues to my heart has been to address the many
challenges faced by the displacement of our Palestinian refugees specifically
those directly impacted by occupation and the instability of our region. I
decided to join Al-Awda The Palestine Right to Return Coalition organization over
eight years ago with that focus in mind—I wanted to help raise awareness in our
communities about the human and legal rights of Palestinian refugees, while
organizing efforts that offer humanitarian aid and empower them with projects
that nurture their autonomy. </p>
<p>I’ve had the honor of organizing numerous relief efforts with my colleagues at         Al-Awda and with several humanitarian organizations
across the US. Together we managed to raise thousands of dollars that helped
alleviate some of the suffering and hardships of our refugees in Gaza, Tanaf
camp, Al-Waleed camp, Yarmouk camp &amp; the Palestinian refugee community in
Lebanon. This year I have new two new projects that I will be personally working
on and fundraising for: Aida Refugee Camp near Beit Lahem and the Gaza Refugee
Camp in Jarash. I’m seeking your help to achieve my goal of raising $40k. </p>
<p>I chose to fund
raise for these two specific camps because not only are they in dire need of
support to execute their valuable programs, but also because of their highly
appraised reputation and commitment to transparency. Lajee center in Aida, for
example, is known to be one of the most active and transparent organizations in
the West Bank; Last year they received a 9.4 out of 10 by the European Union
for clarity in their financial reports. As a result, the EU funded the camp with
a three-year program to work with 12 other refugee camps in the West Bank. I
personally visited the Lajee center in 2010 &amp; 2011 and was very impressed
with their efforts and resourcefulness in combating the different challenges
they’ve been facing—especially after Israel built the wall around the camp,
which is home to over 6000 refugees, and where more than half of them are
children under the age of 18.</p>
<p>I also chose the
Gaza Refugee Camp this year after I learned about it from our Imam who has been
generously supporting several of their projects for the past 3 years. The camp
has an estimated 30,000 Gazan refugees who have no ID number in the country and
have harder time obtaining jobs, therefore its very expensive for them to
complete their education. In turn, I got connected with the Co-founder
at “Hopes for Women in Education” who has been working tirelessly with her team
to manage several vital projects in the Gaza Refugee camp, that hopefully your
generous donations will help sustain.</p>

</div></div>","BBdone is the
        result of last technologies
        applied to babies's world. BBdone is a baby bottle maker machine
        that has been
        created to provide parents with a useful tool to feed babies
        when they are
        tired or have few time. BBdone has proved to be a good tool to
        be use when you
        need to prepared bottles for more than one baby or need to
        provide feeding
        quickly. This small electrical appliance included all the
        recommendations
        regarding the bottle feeding for babies, the exact temperature
        of water, the
        exact amount of powder milk and the hygienic functioning. We
        have also
        developed a product that meet all the certifications in this
        kind of appliance
        and that integrates in any place because it has small
        dimensions. We offer also
        a good solution to places where preparing bottles is necessary
        because
        breastfeeding is not possible and where there are many babies
        like hospitals or
        kindergardens. We recommend to follow the guides for
        breastfeeding but we are
        aware about those situations where this is not possible for
        several reasons.








To prepare a baby bottle with BBdone machine, you only have to 
put the powder milk in the right deposit, then fulfil the water deposit 
and finally pressing a button the machine begins to work, the water 
temperature reach the maximum recommended for babies and the machine 
maintain the water in this temperature and the BBdone dispenses the 
accurate amount of milk recommended by paediatrics for formula. BBdone 
prepare the perfect baby bottle automatically,  in less than 30 seconds 
by 
just pressing a button.

<p><b>The Challenge</b></p>
<p>Many people seeking relief from
psychological and emotional challenges do not achieve the improvements they
expect from counseling or realize the full benefits of therapy. It has been
reported that as many <span>as <strong><span>41% of patients in the U.S. quit
psychotherapy prematurely</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p>Even upon completing a therapy
program, current therapeutic practice does not provide clients much tangible
evidence of the issues they have uncovered and the progress they have made.
Post-therapy, most people have few or no physical, visible reminders of the
path of discovery they have taken, the growth they have achieved, and the
positive changes they have initiated in their cognitive beliefs, behaviors and
coping skills.</p>
<p>They require help to continue
developing self-questioning and inner reflection, and to prevent relapse into
old thinking and behaviors.</p>
<p><b>The Solution</b></p>
<p>Therapy professionals need
support tools and processes to help generate more favorable therapeutic
outcomes and diminish abandonment and relapse rates. <b><span>A visual reminder of these successes and
milestones can help prevent reversion to old habits and thought patterns.</span></b></p>
<p>Tangible tools are a powerful
addition to the abstract ideas and principles emphasized in many therapeutic
modalities: they more thoroughly engage the client’s focus and foster a
positive client-therapist relationship by serving as an ongoing reminder of
their progress and the core issues being addressed. This promotes the desire
for continued therapy and reinforces newly acquired cognitive beliefs,
behaviors, and skills after formal therapy has ended.</p>
<p><b>The Product</b></p>
<p>Life’s Onion<sup>®</sup>

is made. </p>
<p><b>Life’s Onion<sup>®</sup>

<p> GreenTREE Yoga is an established charity nonprofit with the mission of
bringing the benefits of yoga to underserved populations and the people who
work with them (greentreeyoga.org). Our program focus is trauma-sensitive yoga,
so we work in Title One schools, with veterans, and in shelters.  We also
do professional development for social workers, nurses, health care
professionals, and teachers. </p>
<p>We have developed a trauma-sensitive yoga program that allows us to share
yoga with veterans at the Salt Lake Veterans Administration (VA).  We provide two weekly classes for women only
and two classes for both men and women. </p>
<p>GreenTREE is in the third year of a five year contract for trauma-sensitive
yoga at the VA.  We've expanded to FIVE classes a week!  We also provide
professional development for clinicians on how to use simple yoga for trauma
and vicarious trauma – for self-care and with their clients. Teaching veterans
how to feel safe in their bodies and how to manage their stress (and to share
these ideas with others) is one of the most rewarding things I do. </p>
<p>Yoga offers a
body-based intervention for trauma survivors, using both the mind and body to
promote healing.  Trauma-sensitive,
body-based yoga helps people with PTDS to feel their bodies, to learn to
befriend their bodies, and to self-regulate. This all supports neuronal
rewiring of the brain so that people may regain a positive approach to life and
to find enjoyment in their days.</p>
<p>All of your contributions would go directly toward providing free DVDs/CDs
to veterans, to provide more free community trauma-sensitive yoga classes to
veterans, and to fund an 'Art and Yoga' program at the Women Veterans’ Retreat
at The National Ability Center in Park City in July, 2015. </p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>We want to raise $1,500 for our veterans’ program: (1)for our popular CD/DVDs “Yoga for
Caregivers’ to donate to veterans taking our yoga classes  (2) for journals and art materials for our journaling classes we offer after our yoga classes ; 3) Materials for our Art and Yoga Program offered at VA retreats for women with military sexual trauma;  and, 4) free, community-based, trauma-sensitive yoga classes for veterans - we will work with Team Red White and Blue.</p>
<p>The Art and Yoga program is our successful program in which we help children
address trauma by combining the benefits of yoga and artistic
expression. They do the yoga and art with their mothers and receive
free materials and yoga games to support using yoga breaks to self-regulate at
home. </p>
<p>We will apply ALL of the funds we receive toward the program
implementation.  </p>

</ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>GreenTREE Yoga has established strong working relationship with the Salt
Lake VA over the past 3 years. </p>
<p>Research* has shown that
a body-based, somatic approach to healing trauma is an important first step. A
trauma-sensitive yoga practice can help people learn to befriend their bodies
and to feel safe. Only after feeling the body and learning to feel safe in the
body can one learn to regulate core arousal systems, to relax, through simple
breathing techniques.  If a person can’t
feel his body, if the limbic system is in overdrive (Daniel Siegel calls it
“limbic lava”), then he is not able to benefit from talking, a higher level
cognitive function.  A highly stressed
person is not open to processing language, to what therapists have to say.  First, you have to get a person calm, then
one can access the functions in the prefrontal cortex.  Trauma-sensitive yoga provides tools for each
of these three steps:  first feeling the
body, then feeling safe in the body, and then regulating core arousal systems.</p>
<p>  The last piece of the healing puzzle is
that this process of body-based healing helps people to rewire the brain, to
use the brain’s strong abilities to undergo neuroplasticity so that people may
find joy in their lives again.  </p>

Thanks to companies restructuring both parents lost their jobs, and couldn't provide her with the needed growth hormones in her early childhood. She's now barely 5ft tall... because she couldn't afford to grow. 
During a surgery she contracted a nasty bacteria that massacred her kidneys. 
She was on dialysis for years until a conscious doctor arranged for kidney transplantation surgery. Her mother (lady to the left in the pic) donated the kidney. 
But she now faces losing the donated kidney because her family can't afford regular treatment for the next 3 years.    What she needs? Dakkie needs about $200/mo for the next 3 years for treatment. That's it. No big sums, no long lists of complex medical procedures. The money goes to daily administering the needed medication to save this girl's last chance to live. 
    The Impact Dakkie is a teenage girl living in an impoverished family. 
She is 5ft. tall because of poverty. 
She spent her childhood in dialysis rooms because of poverty.
She faces a life threatening situation, again, because of poverty. 
No teenager should have her life stolen from her because of poverty... especially when it's so easy to get the minimum sum she needs to at least live. 
    Risks & Challenges If you've read so far, you do have a heart that wants to help. The risk now is that you'd just say ""nah, forget about this, I'd like to support a different cause that's more dramatic"". 
The challenge is to stop for a second here and consider this: There's no greater drama than deciding the fate of a 17 year old with a single click of a mouse. 
Imagine, with a $20 donation, you help Dakkie push through two days. With a $200, she can get through a month worth of medication. With $2400, you purchase an entire year of life for this teen. Together, with only $8000, we secure her survival. 
The $8000 will buy LIFE for this teenager. 
    Other Ways You Can Help Helping Dakkie is very easy. She doesn't need a heap of money. Take part in the joy of living Dakkie will have, buy a month of life for her, or a year, or how much you are willing to give, but please, do give.
Also, share this with your friends, family, colleagues etc. The more people know, the more Dakkie's chance to live are better.

When I became a mom, I felt like I was floating on an inner tube on the ocean. Every once in a while a friend would float by and we'd hold hands for a moment - and then the waves would take me away again.<br/><br/>The isolation was surprising, considering I'd been teaching prenatal yoga for many years.<br/><br/>But for a new mom, sometimes our whole day is about getting baby to take a nap. And we're not even successful at that. 
<br/><br/><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">And my yoga practice just didn't seem to fit.

</div></div>","Hi I'm Jessica. When I became a mom, I felt like I was floating on an inner tube on the ocean. Every once in a while a friend would float by and we'd hold hands for a moment - and then the waves would take me away again.The isolation was surprising, considering I'd been teaching prenatal yoga for many years.But for a new mom, sometimes our whole day is about getting baby to take a nap. And we're not even successful at that. 
And my yoga practice just didn't seem to fit. I didn't have an hour of serene time, I couldn't afford childcare to go to class, and Sun Salutes were not helping me find my core again - in fact they seemed to be making it worse.I created Ma Yoga not only to help pregnant women and new moms stay strong, calm and out of pain throughout their journey, but to provide communities in their neighborhoods where they could bring baby back to class.In our Prenatal and Mom Yoga, we give specific guidance in exactly what our bodies need at every point in the journey to motherhood an beyond - on and off the mat.So far, Ma Yoga teachers have helped over 5,000 women in Southern California have an empowering transition to motherhood.But we know that many women who do not have easy access to classes, or can't afford to go to them. With your support, we are giving birth to a space where yoga teachers, birth practitioners and mom experts can provide classes and talks for pregnant women and new moms everywhere.The Ma Yoga Living Room will be an online platform where open-hearted and wise professionals can share their gifts with more mamas going through this vulnerable chapter in our lives. We will be able to teach more women to access their innate power, wisdom, and nurturing energy.Please stand with us in our mission by giving us whatever feels right for you. Just by contributing you (and your website if you have none) will be listed on our Ma Yoga Friends page - and at different donation levels there are different ""perks"".Don't forget to select your perk on the right side bar by clicking on it - we are offering some great ones, and if you select The Ma Yoga I CAN Core Strengthening Program for Post-Baby Bellies (and Diastisis Recti), you'll be part of an intimate group getting personal support from me as I share each video in the 2-month program.P.us you'll get my Morning ""Ma"" Meditation and the Low Back Relief practice as well.We are so grateful for your support - thank you!



Our mission: to provide guidance, inspiration and support for pregnant women and new moms in their own living rooms.
We will also offer online prenatal and postpartum teacher trainings for yoga teachers, so they can create their own mama circles in their own neighborhoods, and join us online. Our list of offerings will start with:

<br/><p>Sports are one of the biggest revenue generating industries in the world. Individual athletes, amateur teams &amp; leagues, semi-pro teams &amp; leagues and professional sports outside of the U.S., are left out of the billion dollar business plan and are missing huge amounts of opportunity.  Currently, most athletes, teams and leagues don't have a centralized network and effective, interactive approach to reaching their community.   Individual athletes, amateur and semi-pro teams &amp; leagues, and professional sports outside the U.S. are largely left out of the billion-dollar industry and are missing out on huge opportunities.

<p>The NCAA, MLB, NFL, NASCAR, NBA, and other televised sports leagues have been able to aggregate their markets. If individuals, teams, and leagues around the world could easily share their sports moments with their fans, family, and friends, then their value and money-making potential would expand exponentially. Millions of dollars are generated on YouTube using amateur and professional-athlete footage, but the athletes and amateur teams receive none of it.

<p></p>So many athletes are left undiscovered because of lack of exposure and a simple inability to get noticed. Many athletes are good enough to play NCAA sports and are popular enough in their community to earn money through the sport they love; they just don't have the tools needed to raise funds, and most scholarships don't cover the full cost of tuition. <b>You need exposure to get recruited, and </b><b>scholarships do not provide enough funding on their own to keep you playing.</b>

</div></div>","The Dream


Our dream is to give every athlete, team, and league a way to easily share their sporting lives and raise the funds they need to make their dreams come true.


The Problem?

It takes a lot of money to play sports.  Amateur sports are having trouble funding school and recreational sports alike.  The amount people can participate in sports is directly correlated to how much money they have and the amount of access they have to sports equipment, communities, etc. Countless causes have been founded to address this problem, but charity is not enough. 
Sports are one of the biggest revenue generating industries in the world. Individual athletes, amateur teams & leagues, semi-pro teams & leagues and professional sports outside of the U.S., are left out of the billion dollar business plan and are missing huge amounts of opportunity.  Currently, most athletes, teams and leagues don't have a centralized network and effective, interactive approach to reaching their community.   Individual athletes, amateur and semi-pro teams & leagues, and professional sports outside the U.S. are largely left out of the billion-dollar industry and are missing out on huge opportunities. Currently athletes, teams, and leagues lack a centralized network to reach their communities. They don't have one place to reach their fans, monetize their media, and raise funds. Amateur sports needs a better way to sustain itself.
The NCAA, MLB, NFL, NASCAR, NBA, and other televised sports leagues have been able to aggregate their markets. If individuals, teams, and leagues around the world could easily share their sports moments with their fans, family, and friends, then their value and money-making potential would expand exponentially. Millions of dollars are generated on YouTube using amateur and professional-athlete footage, but the athletes and amateur teams receive none of it. The NCAA, publications, professional leagues, and websites are generating billions off of these ""small-time"" athletes and local teams. It's time that this silent majority had the right tools to harness the revenue they generate.
So many athletes are left undiscovered because of lack of exposure and a simple inability to get noticed. Many athletes are good enough to play NCAA sports and are popular enough in their community to earn money through the sport they love; they just don't have the tools needed to raise funds, and most scholarships don't cover the full cost of tuition. You need exposure to get recruited, and scholarships do not provide enough funding on their own to keep you playing.

gas and improving digestion.</p>
<p><b>Where Will

</b><p>The product
will sell via online retailers and eventually at health food stores and pharmacies
across the country.</p>
<p><b>Why Create This Product Now?</b></p><b>
</b><p>With 60% of people complaining of gas and bloating 2 or more
times per week, it seems obvious that the existing over-the-counter (OTC)

</div>","Let’s talk frankly. Gas and bloating blows! 
95% of us have experienced it at one point or another....60% of us suffer from it 2 or more times per week....Yep, there’s no better way to describe it. IT BLOWS!
I know this from personal, painful experience. From the time I was a young child growing up in Puerto Rico, I suffered from painful gas and bloating almost daily. I'm talking debilitating pain and trapped gas that would stay with me for hours.
Today, in my work as a nutrition coach, I see this problem
happen to clients over and over.
The Birth Of D-Gest
After years of learning about herbalism, detox and
plant-based nutrition, I discovered that herbs (some of the most popular ones
used in your favorite meals today) can help relieve these awful symptoms in a
safe and highly effective way.So I set out to create an herbal mix based on
what I’ve learned from years studying Chinese Medicine and Ayurveda and used
myself as a “guinea pig” to test its efficiency.
The result was so successful that I started to offer my
little remedy to my friends and later my coaching clients, all with high
levels of success. 
No more gas and bloat!

The Team
I wanted the world to have access to this amazing formula, so
I set out to find an experienced team that could help me bring this dream a
reality.
I teamed up with Roy Krebs and Ben Hebert (from
Natural Stacks), who are revolutionizing the supplement industry with high-quality, organic ingredients and an iron-clad, full-transparency policy and an
impressive commitment to excellence and quality.
They believed in my product, got really excited about the
idea, and we partnered together to create D-Gest Naturals, a new supplement
company that will eventually include a full line of supplement products for
digestive health.Our first product will be an organic, herbal remedy to relieve gas and bloating. Check out our FAQ's for more details about D-Gest!______________________________________________________________________________Frequently Asked Questions
What Is
D-Gest?
D-Gest is a supplement
product to relieve gas and bloating, sold in an eco-friendly, discreet packaging
and using an all-vegetarian, highly effective formula based on ancient Ayurveda
recipes.
What Does D-Gest Do?
Simply put, D-Gest helps you eliminate discomfort, pain and embarrassment by reducing
gas and improving digestion.
Where Will
It Be Sold? 
The product
will sell via online retailers and eventually at health food stores and pharmacies
across the country.
Why Create This Product Now?
With 60% of people complaining of gas and bloating 2 or more
times per week, it seems obvious that the existing over-the-counter (OTC)
remedies for digestive discomfort are not very effective.

D-Gest is a vegetarian herbal formula that is safe and
healthy for you.
The active ingredients in D-Gest are herbs used for hundreds
of years in the treatment of gas and bloating and are well studied and well
known to provide relief in minutes.

</div><p><b>The World's First Wind Power Plant - Carousel</b></p><p>Greetings to people of whole world.</p><p>I live in Poland and im 24 years old, because of the lack of regular, good paid job I live thanks to casual jobs but the income is misery. Because I'm very poor and sometiemes do not have money for energy bills so every year after winter energy provider is cutting me power in my house. Untill i do not settle the bills, we are cut from the world, internet, messages, but the oven is not working and it's dark everywhere.</p><p>It is very stresfull, thats why my dream is to change it, so That no man in the world has to know that feeling. Therefore, and present you my Invention.</p><p>Pros and cons of today's wind power plants:</p><p>Advantages:</p><p>- Do not pollutes the environment,<br/>- does not need fuel or water,<br/>- uses inexhausible source of power That is wind<br/>- wind energy is a renevable, it will never end, opposite to coal or gas<br/>- It is clean energy. No harmfull gases are freed to the atmosphere,<br/>- Wind is free so theres no risk of prices going up,</p><p>- Possibility of using small wind turbines and production of power in terrain where there is no current network.</p><p>Disadvantages:</p><p>- High cost of Investition in comparision with power gained, <br/>- inequality in deliviery of electric energy and high fluctuations in given time</p><p>- Wind can change. You can not predict exactly the power of wind,</p><p>- Wind farms use much space, uninhabitant areas are needed, far from cities,</p><p>- There are not equal conditions That build wind power plants in every place in the country. In many places wind is too weak,</p><p>- Big clusters of power turbins are dangerous for birds.</p><p>- Opponents of wind energy say That, turbins are source of noise. Indeed work in close neighborhood of windmill can be annoying but always wind farms are builded in reasonable distances from houses, so the noise is not harmfull for people.</p><ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436545130/hyra0mugurqoqqdojgpi.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>In That situation</p>
<p>I want to open a company which will produce wind power plants in shape of carousel. That power station will not be dependent from any weather conditions dry as: wind, sun light or water, because power will be <b>generated by wind That will be produced by itself That power station</b> . That wind will always blow in the same direction, thats is - to the shoulders of electric turbines. It will not be like in nature, once from left, once from right and some times there's no wind at all or too weak / strong. In That case everything will be regulated by a computer.</p>
<p>Mainly it will be produced for dry recipients like: Households, small companies, housing associations and also will be used in places with no power. Because of the big companies That hold energy for themselves and enforce thier prices to people its time to change it, energy should be very cheap for everyone. Time to change people drama because they do not have money to pay thier bills. Our priority right now as humanity should be free of energy and internet for everyone because everyone has right to free information and heat in the house.</p>
<p>Please do not listen to Scholars, engineers, politicians, and biussnessmans That tell you its impossible because they have thier own Reasons That everything is so expensive.</p>
<p>Its time to change it</p>
<p>Everyone of us atleast once in life the wind felt on face while having fun on a carousel, just think, its so simple. Not using a dry an energy with today's technology is a sin.</p>
<p>Together with my brother and father in builded a small model of this idea so That everyone can see how its supposed to work, keep in mind That this is from the cheapest materials and power turbines were not even used in it, because of costs. That's why we want to ask people from around the world for help.</p>
<p>In current situation we dont have the funds to deploy the idea to life, gaining 250,000 euros but with your help will let us use the best technology and hopefull will cause production series That will help everyone. Big companies will be forced to lower energy prices.</p>
<p>Supporting our Invention Will Contribute everyone.</p>
<p>Very important advantage of our power generator Is That it doesnt need any permissions beause it dont have to be installed on ground Permanently, its moveable and it can stand in any place.</p>
<p>For example power station That will give 10 kW will wigh around 300kg, and will take around 5 square meters of space.</p>
<p>Area of ​​100 meters can have 20 of dry and power generators.</p>
<p>I'd like to inform that i have a letter of application, the Patent Office.</p>

</ul><p></p></div>","The World's First Wind Power Plant - CarouselGreetings to people of whole world.I live in Poland and im 24 years old, because of the lack of regular, good paid job I live thanks to casual jobs but the income is misery. Because I'm very poor and sometiemes do not have money for energy bills so every year after winter energy provider is cutting me power in my house. Untill i do not settle the bills, we are cut from the world, internet, messages, but the oven is not working and it's dark everywhere.It is very stresfull, thats why my dream is to change it, so That no man in the world has to know that feeling. Therefore, and present you my Invention.Pros and cons of today's wind power plants:Advantages:- Do not pollutes the environment,- does not need fuel or water,- uses inexhausible source of power That is wind- wind energy is a renevable, it will never end, opposite to coal or gas- It is clean energy. No harmfull gases are freed to the atmosphere,- Wind is free so theres no risk of prices going up,- Possibility of using small wind turbines and production of power in terrain where there is no current network.Disadvantages:- High cost of Investition in comparision with power gained, - inequality in deliviery of electric energy and high fluctuations in given time- Wind can change. You can not predict exactly the power of wind,- Wind farms use much space, uninhabitant areas are needed, far from cities,- There are not equal conditions That build wind power plants in every place in the country. In many places wind is too weak,- Big clusters of power turbins are dangerous for birds.- Opponents of wind energy say That, turbins are source of noise. Indeed work in close neighborhood of windmill can be annoying but always wind farms are builded in reasonable distances from houses, so the noise is not harmfull for people.

In That situation
I want to open a company which will produce wind power plants in shape of carousel. That power station will not be dependent from any weather conditions dry as: wind, sun light or water, because power will be generated by wind That will be produced by itself That power station . That wind will always blow in the same direction, thats is - to the shoulders of electric turbines. It will not be like in nature, once from left, once from right and some times there's no wind at all or too weak / strong. In That case everything will be regulated by a computer.
Mainly it will be produced for dry recipients like: Households, small companies, housing associations and also will be used in places with no power. Because of the big companies That hold energy for themselves and enforce thier prices to people its time to change it, energy should be very cheap for everyone. Time to change people drama because they do not have money to pay thier bills. Our priority right now as humanity should be free of energy and internet for everyone because everyone has right to free information and heat in the house.
Please do not listen to Scholars, engineers, politicians, and biussnessmans That tell you its impossible because they have thier own Reasons That everything is so expensive.
Its time to change it
Everyone of us atleast once in life the wind felt on face while having fun on a carousel, just think, its so simple. Not using a dry an energy with today's technology is a sin.
Together with my brother and father in builded a small model of this idea so That everyone can see how its supposed to work, keep in mind That this is from the cheapest materials and power turbines were not even used in it, because of costs. That's why we want to ask people from around the world for help.
In current situation we dont have the funds to deploy the idea to life, gaining 250,000 euros but with your help will let us use the best technology and hopefull will cause production series That will help everyone. Big companies will be forced to lower energy prices.
Supporting our Invention Will Contribute everyone.
Very important advantage of our power generator Is That it doesnt need any permissions beause it dont have to be installed on ground Permanently, its moveable and it can stand in any place.
For example power station That will give 10 kW will wigh around 300kg, and will take around 5 square meters of space.
Area of ​​100 meters can have 20 of dry and power generators.
I'd like to inform that i have a letter of application, the Patent Office.
Drawnings with explanation:


1- 10 KV electric turbine frame 2- 3- electric motor with the propeller about 1,200 watts 4- direction of the rotors and a set to get 50 rpm The turbine 10kV to give the 100% needed 50 rpm then get 10kV minus 3X 1200 watt motors = 3.6 kV 10kV minus 3.6 = 6.4 kV earnings      
 
 
 


Very Important !!
Whole device of our Wind Power Plant - Carousel
will have two additional elements needed for proper working but i can not revel them right now.
They will be revealed later.
At the same time, keep in mind That it's not Perpetuum Mobile.
Rewards.
Today, when we do not have anything, it's difficult to promise rewards.
Regarding the possible rewards for people who will support my project is all these people will be covered by the discount rate being from 1% to 15% when purchasing the finished product.
It will be possible when the company will operate and sell the product.
Movie:
Movie shows a model of device, you can see That if electric engine is working, it's powering the carousel and the remaining turbins are moving thanks to the power of just one electric engine. Please pay attention at the shots filmed in closed space where outside wind doens't blow wind only produced by small weak engine. I note that in current situation and do not have the funds that realize a good prototype so and show you what i have.

<p>What is ergonomics?  Ergonomics is the science that studies how to optimize the relationship between humans and their work environment.  For example:  Office workers with computers, outdoor workers with tools and equipment.  Our bodies have to interact with our work environments to carry out our daily work processes.</p>

<p>We are a new startup company with only very limited resources.  We started our company based on the idea that we could possibly come up with a solution to help people who suffer from back pain and upper body pain while working everyday.  Its an important project to us.  Our goal is to help people improve their work environment ergonomically which will in turn help improve their health and fitness to be more productive at work and live better and healthier lives without aching pain (s).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have done studies/interviews about health and fitness with people who work in office environments, people who drive trucks, factory workers and outdoor workers as well.  What we found is that working at a computer everyday, driving,  working in factories, and construction/outdoor workers in their everyday work activities, bending over, twisting and turning the upper body in a work day, they complained about pain mostly in the lower back.  However, they also complained about chronic pain that occurred in other areas of the upper body. </p>
<h2>Good posture while working everyday, ergonomically?</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>What we have done is after testing 5 prototypes and making improvements from the 1st prototype  and making more improvements  from the 2nd prototype to the 5th, we have come up with a solution to solve those problems.  As you can see in the demonstration photos below our ergonomic sleeveless and short sleeve vests covers different areas  of the upper body and FITS SO PERFECTLY for compression to those areas.   And no pressure on the abdomen, unlike most support devices.  (No More Bulky, Uncomfortable Back Braces and Other Support Devices).  Our designs are patented and they work great!</p>

<p>On behalf of Rally4Hunger, a non-profit and charitable organization, We are honored and blessed to
have the opportunity to return to Sony Sugar Complex and team up with the organization True
Happiness is Giving. The mission of R4H is to create a fun tennis competition
for our youth to tally total rally points to convert into food to reach out to help the community
food needs. We are excited to give the children a tennis experience that will enable them
to give back to their community. <br/></p>
<p>The director of THIG, Roselyn Opel, has established an
organization that is run by women volunteers seeking to help the less fortunate by involving and
empowering boys/girls through sports. True Happiness is Giving has offered to help volunteer to
assist during the tennis event as well has help with delivering the food to the necessary locations
after the event.
</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>From a recent Press Release, Roselyn
Opel, the director of THIG, states “So you Begin…I began…Just Begin…One,
One, One.” After teaching tennis to the children at Sony Sugar complex in June
of 2015,
Stacey Smith was invited back to organize a Rally4Hunger event with the players
at Sony Sugar
Complex.  Says Peter Awino, headmaster at Sony Sugar Complex School,“We
welcome Rally4Hunger at Sony under our guidance because I have a lot of confidence
in her and her tennis program.
<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>This past May/June we teamed up with Tennis4Africa under the direction of Steve Verkouter.  We delivered over 300 racquets, 300 balls, and 11 racquets to 12 different schools;in addition to having four Rally4Hunger events at select schools in the Nairobi slums as well as in Migori
County. We raised over 1000 lbs. and delivered all of the food directly back to the students
participating in the event. Rally4Hunger is open to giving back to the participants from Sony Sugar Complex but would
also love to help deliver food packages to the nearby communities.
</p>
<p>Our projected goal for this event is 2000 lbs. of food. We hope to raise most of the funds through this site.  We also welcome credit card processing or electronic wiring means to Business First Bank for those donors who would prefer that method. Email Rally4Hunger@gmail.com to contact the Director, Stacey Smith for these options.  We plan to have approximately 150-
200 participants (75-100 teams). After the first round of fifteen minutes, the total points will be
added up to see if we are close to reaching our goal of 20 balls rallied in a row per team. We will
welcome a second round if necessary to reach the Rally Goal. Rally4Hunger will be converting the
points into food items that will be donated to Migori County after the event. With the
Rally4Hunger donations given from the worldwide supporters, we hope to be able help provide
over 1500 meals. Our CROWDING-FUNDING GOAL is $3000 in food donations for this event and we need your support. <br/></p>
<p>Lastly and most importantly, we truly appreciate the generosity and support of Sony Sugar Complex during our last visit
with Tennis4Africa's founder and Director, Steve Verkouter from Belgium. We would not have had this opportunity to continue the
tour without Sony's willingness to assist with accommodations and meals during our stay. Thank you Peter Awino, Headmaster of Sony Sugar, for believing in us. We are Blessed to again have the open invitation to stay at Sony during the Rally4Hunger NOVEMBER 18th -22nd and to be able to continue to provide this community outreach
opportunity for the children though tennis. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

<p></p><p>Calling everyone who flies: join our GIVE TEN, GET TEN campaign to make air travel healthier. GIVE $10 (or 10 of any currency) to a university research team to develop a blood test for airline crews and passengers (read on...). GET 10 of your Facebook friends (or any friends, or even people you don't like!) to do the same... </p><p>Ever smelled dirty socks during an airline flight? A dirty socks smell coming from the aircraft air supply vents is likely to be engine oil fumes in the ventilation air. You read that right: the air that comes through the cabin and flight deck vents is first compressed in the engines, and it isn’t filtered before you breathe it. Many crew unions around the world receive regular reports from members who report dirty socks or musty fumes in the cabin supply air, followed by problems with memory, balance, and speech, for example. Nobody thinks it will happen to them, until it does.</p><p>Every day, just in the US alone, there is an official report of toxic oil fumes contaminating the air you breathe on regular commercial flights.  Let alone the many more reports documented around the globe. Aviation engine oils contain neurotoxic additives, so breathing the fumes can cause lasting damage to your brain. Also, flight safety can be compromised when crews are impaired inflight. You will meet some affected crewmembers in our video.  </p><p>As things stand, few people  can  access the aircraft maintenance records to PROVE that oil contaminated the cabin air. And there is no blood test specific to these fumes, so airlines often say that “nothing was wrong” and that crews and passengers are just imagining their disabling symptoms. Fortunately, a dedicated research team at the University of Washington is developing a blood test specific to the aviation engine oil. You can help by donating to this campaign. </p><p>If you breathed oil fumes on YOUR flight today, how would you prove it? If you’re a crewmember, would the airline doctor listen and support you, or pressure to you to return to work sick?

Calling everyone who flies: join our GIVE TEN, GET TEN campaign to make air travel healthier. GIVE $10 (or 10 of any currency) to a university research team to develop a blood test for airline crews and passengers (read on...). GET 10 of your Facebook friends (or any friends, or even people you don't like!) to do the same... Ever smelled dirty socks during an airline flight? A dirty socks smell coming from the aircraft air supply vents is likely to be engine oil fumes in the ventilation air. You read that right: the air that comes through the cabin and flight deck vents is first compressed in the engines, and it isn’t filtered before you breathe it. Many crew unions around the world receive regular reports from members who report dirty socks or musty fumes in the cabin supply air, followed by problems with memory, balance, and speech, for example. Nobody thinks it will happen to them, until it does.Every day, just in the US alone, there is an official report of toxic oil fumes contaminating the air you breathe on regular commercial flights.  Let alone the many more reports documented around the globe. Aviation engine oils contain neurotoxic additives, so breathing the fumes can cause lasting damage to your brain. Also, flight safety can be compromised when crews are impaired inflight. You will meet some affected crewmembers in our video.  As things stand, few people  can  access the aircraft maintenance records to PROVE that oil contaminated the cabin air. And there is no blood test specific to these fumes, so airlines often say that “nothing was wrong” and that crews and passengers are just imagining their disabling symptoms. Fortunately, a dedicated research team at the University of Washington is developing a blood test specific to the aviation engine oil. You can help by donating to this campaign. If you breathed oil fumes on YOUR flight today, how would you prove it? If you’re a crewmember, would the airline doctor listen and support you, or pressure to you to return to work sick? Would your doctor tell you that you’re over 50 now, so maybe that explains your memory problems? Can you afford to not work and not get paid for a while? These are the stories that previously-healthy crewmembers share, and passengers breathe the same air...Everyone who flies needs this blood test, so we all need to GIVE 10 of any currency and GET 10 friends to do the same. If you are exposed to oil fumes onboard, then you need to be able to prove it, and all of us need the industry to feel more motivated to clean up the cabin air.A single person’s TEN DOLLARS won’t fund anything, but our GOAL is to bring ENOUGH people onboard that ENOUGH ten dollar donations are received, that the research will be a success, for the good of crews everywhere.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>My name is Josiah James. I am a certified personal trainer and a former professional athlete. Basketball was my passion my entire life, but all good things must come to an end. I started LifeStyle Health &amp; Fitness to reach people who may be intimidated by the gym but wanted to get healthy. I use my experience as a trainer and athlete to develop enjoyable training regimens that are accessible for every age and skill level. To date, I have helped my clients reach a broad range of  goals, including weight loss, toning, and rehabilitation. I often use the group coaching format to develop a community of supportive people that will hold one another accountable. From there, I have branched out to individual training and meal planning to move my clients closer to their goals.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I am currently seeking about $50,000 to grow my business. I need to purchase a used company van, well needed fitness equipment and have enough capital to possibly get my own studio space.  The underlying magic with LifeStyle Fitness is its convenience. I drive to meet my clients at a local park or a gym, which has worn my personal vehicle . In addition, I would like to rent a small studio space to invite my clients for group classes which have been a cornerstone for my business. A bulk of the funding would help in covering these overhead cost during the first year.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, my best quality is my willingness and ability to go to our clients. Anytime of day, if a client wants to have a session we meet at a location that is convenient to the client. We charge each client $25 per one on one session. We also offer small group classes. I encourage people to put small groups of friends, family or coworkers together and workout together for that extra motivation that we all need sometimes. Groups of less than 5 people are charged $15 each. Five or more pay only $10 each.</p>
<p>Having a studio or a home for my business will not only generate more income but will also act as a marketing tool. People are nosy. Capitalizing on curious motorists or passersby will help grow my business at a faster pace. </p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>My ultimate goal is help touch and change people lives through exercise and promoting healthy eating habits. It is no secret that regular exercising along with eating healthy will impact life expectancy and physical appearance which also  impacts confidence and promotes positive body image. Group classes are highly encouraged to help with team building and camaraderie. The most gratifying part of my job is when a client tells me how much weight they have lost, how good they feel, or how much more energy they have after a recent session with me.</p>
<p>Here's a portion of a recent email from one of my clients: ""Thank you for the great work out today. I wanted to tell you this but I don't like to talk about weight because I've always been overweight most of my life and it bothers me.  I have always been the biggest one in the group so this has not only boosted my esteem and confidence but I'm feeling healthier and have more energy. <br/>Back in October/November when started this fitness class I was 220. Then when we started the meal plan and exercising the way we are, I'm currently 195. Inches wise I measured myself on January 18th and was 44"" today I'm 42"". </p>
<p>This is what makes what I do so gratifying and enjoyable.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>My motto has always been: ""I hate losing more than I like winning"".

</div></div>","Short Summary My name is Josiah James. I am a certified personal trainer and a former professional athlete. Basketball was my passion my entire life, but all good things must come to an end. I started LifeStyle Health & Fitness to reach people who may be intimidated by the gym but wanted to get healthy. I use my experience as a trainer and athlete to develop enjoyable training regimens that are accessible for every age and skill level. To date, I have helped my clients reach a broad range of  goals, including weight loss, toning, and rehabilitation. I often use the group coaching format to develop a community of supportive people that will hold one another accountable. From there, I have branched out to individual training and meal planning to move my clients closer to their goals.   What We Need & What You Get I am currently seeking about $50,000 to grow my business. I need to purchase a used company van, well needed fitness equipment and have enough capital to possibly get my own studio space.  The underlying magic with LifeStyle Fitness is its convenience. I drive to meet my clients at a local park or a gym, which has worn my personal vehicle . In addition, I would like to rent a small studio space to invite my clients for group classes which have been a cornerstone for my business. A bulk of the funding would help in covering these overhead cost during the first year.
As I mentioned, my best quality is my willingness and ability to go to our clients. Anytime of day, if a client wants to have a session we meet at a location that is convenient to the client. We charge each client $25 per one on one session. We also offer small group classes. I encourage people to put small groups of friends, family or coworkers together and workout together for that extra motivation that we all need sometimes. Groups of less than 5 people are charged $15 each. Five or more pay only $10 each.
Having a studio or a home for my business will not only generate more income but will also act as a marketing tool. People are nosy. Capitalizing on curious motorists or passersby will help grow my business at a faster pace.    The Impact My ultimate goal is help touch and change people lives through exercise and promoting healthy eating habits. It is no secret that regular exercising along with eating healthy will impact life expectancy and physical appearance which also  impacts confidence and promotes positive body image. Group classes are highly encouraged to help with team building and camaraderie. The most gratifying part of my job is when a client tells me how much weight they have lost, how good they feel, or how much more energy they have after a recent session with me.
Here's a portion of a recent email from one of my clients: ""Thank you for the great work out today. I wanted to tell you this but I don't like to talk about weight because I've always been overweight most of my life and it bothers me.  I have always been the biggest one in the group so this has not only boosted my esteem and confidence but I'm feeling healthier and have more energy. Back in October/November when started this fitness class I was 220. Then when we started the meal plan and exercising the way we are, I'm currently 195. Inches wise I measured myself on January 18th and was 44"" today I'm 42"". 
This is what makes what I do so gratifying and enjoyable.   Risks & Challenges My motto has always been: ""I hate losing more than I like winning"". However, we all lose sometimes. With my passion and hard work I know that I can accomplish my goals. One client at a time, one session at a time. 
I live in Miami where fitness is a huge competitive business. I feel that there are two things that sets me apart from my competition. First, I am a people person. I spent 10 years In Europe playing basketball where I worked with people from all different backgrounds. This is definitely an asset in growing my business. Second, I am not in this business to get rich quick or make a few bucks. I genuinely and truly want to help change people's lives through fitness and nutrition.

<p>Our main challenge is that unpasteurized products have a higher risk of going bad, making it harder to maintain the correct temperature and maintaining freshness for our Kombucha.

<b>Our Vision</b><br/>
</h2><p>Vitcci focuses on creating smart products using latest
technologies to make our lives easier, happier and healthier. We started with
the Vitcci Air Purifier and the rest is yet to come. This is just the beginning
of a new brand, new evolution!</p>
<p>We strive to make smart devices even smarter!  With intensive research and futuristic
vision. </p>
<p>With this new air purifier, we thought about coming up with
something different than most nowadays consuming products. As consumers we tend
to look for all sorts of products and forget the most important ones that are
essential to our well-being. As we know, the air we breathe is one of three
elements that go into our body along with foods and drinks, but somehow we
neglect and never check whether it is clean or not.  Instead, we take it in as it is wherever we
are. With Vitcci purifier, our goal is to maintain a cleaner air around us for
a healthier and happier mind and body.</p>
<p>In every step we take, we make sure to come up with ideas
that could be implemented in projects and devices that make our environment
better, and use our technologies to keep it green! </p>
<p>We are located in Santa Barbara, California and our
headquarters office is in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA.</p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462766817/Screen_Shot_2016-05-07_at_12.25.33_AM_lvdpfv.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Product Specifications<br/>

Our Vision
Vitcci focuses on creating smart products using latest
technologies to make our lives easier, happier and healthier. We started with
the Vitcci Air Purifier and the rest is yet to come. This is just the beginning
of a new brand, new evolution!
We strive to make smart devices even smarter!  With intensive research and futuristic
vision. 
With this new air purifier, we thought about coming up with
something different than most nowadays consuming products. As consumers we tend
to look for all sorts of products and forget the most important ones that are
essential to our well-being. As we know, the air we breathe is one of three
elements that go into our body along with foods and drinks, but somehow we
neglect and never check whether it is clean or not.  Instead, we take it in as it is wherever we
are. With Vitcci purifier, our goal is to maintain a cleaner air around us for
a healthier and happier mind and body.
In every step we take, we make sure to come up with ideas
that could be implemented in projects and devices that make our environment
better, and use our technologies to keep it green! 
We are located in Santa Barbara, California and our
headquarters office is in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA.Product Specifications

Another less known fact is that<b> indoor air pollution is one of the top five most dangerous health risks</b> known to human beings.<b> Indoor environments are usually 5-10 times more polluted, than outdoor air</b>, even in moderately polluted cities. Indoor air pollution may come from viral, antibacterial, fungal sources, but synthetic materials (i.e. wall paints, furniture, carpet, plastic, heating and electronic appliances etc.) emit dangerous substances as well. </div>
<div>In contrast to these daunting facts the importance of proper air purification is only just getting more highlighted in households, offices and all other premises where daily routines take place.

<p><b>Smart Air Care (SMAC)</b> refers to a special type of indoor air purification method used in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoor_Air_Quality"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Indoor Air Quality</a> (IAQ) Management, mostly by air conditioner, air quality measurer, ionizer and scenting device producers. The ‘smart’ attributive means controllability by either a smart device or a remote controller and sensory perception that usually decides what type of air care is desired. </p>
<p>Air care is based on air composition examination or other factors such as economic power management. Air care or air management is considered a complex progress as its main goal is to create a beneficial atmosphere for easy human (and animal) breathing and positive physiological effects (I.e. work performance boost, mood lifting). </p>
<p>Smart Air Care uses the following air management methods: ionization, purification, scenting, Silver sterilization, natural humidification, air filtering and applies Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) monitoring.</p>

<div>Let's talk about technology stuff. SOL-ONE isn't your everyday air cleaner, it's close to be an engineering chef-d'oeuvre. Start with the basics:</div>
<div>SOL-ONE is 36x25x25 (cm) relatively small device, but it is larger than it looks, because its massive 3,5 kg thick porcelain housing gives it a majestic impression and its water tank weighs an extra 1,2 kg when filled, so it definitely has an impact on its surroundings.</div>
<div>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464627441/SOL-features_hq0hw5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>
</div>
<div>Here comes the interesting part: </div>
<div>SOL-ONE applies the best quality ionizer currently available, emitting <b>20 MILLION negative ions per cubic centimeter</b>, which is roughly 1000 times stronger than most ionizers on the market. Thanks to its efficient air cleaning ability, it <b>terminates up to 99% of indoor air bacteria, </b>circulating up to <b>250 m3</b> of air every hour. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Plus, you may choose <b>from 8000 LED color tones</b> to set your current mood light.</span>
</div>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464100705/Igg-sol-tech-specs1_hnlav1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
<p>SOL-ONE is made out of 4+1 basic parts. The stand and the cover makes out the housing, inside the housing there's the filter, the fan and the electronics board, which is also the module platform. Below the air filter is a water tank and you can add additional modules to the module platform, that can either ionize or scent your air.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464629858/Title-7_aek3dr.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
SOL-ONE consumes up <b>to 10 Watts of electricity</b> on its full capacity, which is about as much, as an energy saver light bulb's consumption and it was designed to require only occasional maintenance. Since it has a <b>washable air filter, you only have to wash out the filter and refill the water supply every 7 days.</b> Consider it as one of your flowers, that needs watering. </p>
</div>
<div>SOL-ONE's main filtering feature is that it <b>can and should run 24/7 even at night on a super silent 25 dB (lowest) fan noise.</b> </div>
<div>Another cool feature is that it can be <b>completely automated</b>. You can set environment-aware air cleaning, as SOL-ONE takes an air sample every few seconds and measures the amount of ventilation strength needed. The worse the air quality, the higher the fans output will be. You can also schedule when to enter sleeping/silent mode and how often you want to scent your room.</div>

Actually, it was only after we designed its shape, that we knew SOL-ONE needs to see daylight. You can compare it to many natural forms, for some people it looks like a vase, others think it's more like a human curve, but for us it's like a fresh raindrop in the air! In one word SOL-ONE is decoration!</div>

<div><span style=""font-size: 24px;line-height: 30px;""></span></div>As we browsed through countless air purifiers available on the market, we have realized most devices are unattractive and should be hidden away from the eyes.

<p>Our aim is to make SOL-ONE the greatest air care device ever built, with continuous enthusiasm we keep march until we do so.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div></div>","SOL-ONE is a multi-purpose smart indoor equipment. SOL-ONE is not just an air cleaner, it is the world’s first Smart Air Care device with 5 functions in 1 beautiful body.
One of the most neglected threats to human health is indoor air pollution. In large cities we experience a continuous increase in outdoor air pollution, and we tend to believe that there are deﬁnitely no toxins in our indoor air. Clean air in our homes and ofﬁces is vital for us and our family and colleagues. However, furniture, household and ofﬁce equipment and everyday activities may emit invisible harmful pollutions in our indoor environment.Most indoor air puriﬁers don’t ﬁt into any interior, where they are normally used. Their functional appearance simply kills your home’s or ofﬁce’s colors and ﬁne touch, and you have to press old-fashioned switches and buttons to control them. We have developed SOL-ONE that is made of premium quality materials, designed to be nice, efﬁcient and controllable with your smartphone.















PURIFIES YOUR AIR


Operating silently with advanced filter and low operational costs.

Keeping an indoor environment healthy is one of the primary goals of SOL-ONE and to keep it and its environment pathogen-free there's a built-in air filtering system that doesn't need to be replaced anytime. SOL-ONE uses wet textile layer to filter particles in the air



IONIZES YOUR AIR



By emitting 20 millions of negative ions / cubic centimeters makes your air 99% bacteria-free.

 Ionizers produce electrically charged particles that clears volatile chemical compounds (VOCs) out of the air, though not completely eliminating them, instead “sticking” them to other surfaces, like walls and furniture. Proper air ionization has good effects on the respiratory system which leads to an overall better human health.





SCENTS YOUR AIR



Offering you a wide variety of interchangeable scents.

Although humans have a relatively damp sense of smelling compared to certain animals, yet some of the most important human feelings are connected to the olfactory sense. There are various beneficial effects to use scenting in SOL-ONE. Just imagine the smell of coffee or the smell of fresh flowers!




LIGHTS YOUR MOOD


Giving you the option to harmonize the mood lighting color from 8000 tones.

Light therapy is one of today's most recognized alternative healing methods. Different kind of color tones provide a different boosting experience for different desired mental states. Whenever you feel agitated or stressed use a teal color or should you like to make your atmosphere a bit more romantic try magenta!


SMARTPHONE CONTROLLED



With freely downloadable iOS or Android apps. 

Thanks to the SOL remote mobile app, you may change your air purification preferences anytime from your smartphone via Bluetooth. Smart features, such as scheduling and environment-aware operation make SOL-ONE a powerful air purification and scenting system.

The SOL Remote app is already available on App store (v1.6) and Google Play (v1.13), but we plan to upgrade the application in the near-future for a better and smarter experience.









While it is not public knowledge, most people spend 90% of their lifespan indoors. Another less known fact is that indoor air pollution is one of the top five most dangerous health risks known to human beings. Indoor environments are usually 5-10 times more polluted, than outdoor air, even in moderately polluted cities. Indoor air pollution may come from viral, antibacterial, fungal sources, but synthetic materials (i.e. wall paints, furniture, carpet, plastic, heating and electronic appliances etc.) emit dangerous substances as well. 
In contrast to these daunting facts the importance of proper air purification is only just getting more highlighted in households, offices and all other premises where daily routines take place. A detailed list of all significant air filters already exists on EPA’s website.
A properly air managed room has dozens of positive health effects. Some of these effects are attributed to negative ions, but clean air breathed through pollution filtering is also an important factor when it comes to defining what is the right environment for humans and other mammals. 
Some of the health benefits are increased oxygenation of the lungs, increased vital capacity, enhanced celiac activity, reduction of stress, synchronization of the right and the left brain hemispheres, balance of personality, better thinking ability and increased endurance and work capacity. 

Opposite to the positive health benefits, the lack of proper air care cause serotonin hyperfunction syndrome or aka ""irritation syndrome"", stress, fatigue, spontaneous anger, clumsiness, weakness, anxiety and generally a less fortified immune system.









Smart Air Care (SMAC) refers to a special type of indoor air purification method used in Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) Management, mostly by air conditioner, air quality measurer, ionizer and scenting device producers. The ‘smart’ attributive means controllability by either a smart device or a remote controller and sensory perception that usually decides what type of air care is desired. 
Air care is based on air composition examination or other factors such as economic power management. Air care or air management is considered a complex progress as its main goal is to create a beneficial atmosphere for easy human (and animal) breathing and positive physiological effects (I.e. work performance boost, mood lifting). 
Smart Air Care uses the following air management methods: ionization, purification, scenting, Silver sterilization, natural humidification, air filtering and applies Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) monitoring.


Let's talk about technology stuff. SOL-ONE isn't your everyday air cleaner, it's close to be an engineering chef-d'oeuvre. Start with the basics:
SOL-ONE is 36x25x25 (cm) relatively small device, but it is larger than it looks, because its massive 3,5 kg thick porcelain housing gives it a majestic impression and its water tank weighs an extra 1,2 kg when filled, so it definitely has an impact on its surroundings.



Here comes the interesting part: 
SOL-ONE applies the best quality ionizer currently available, emitting 20 MILLION negative ions per cubic centimeter, which is roughly 1000 times stronger than most ionizers on the market. Thanks to its efficient air cleaning ability, it terminates up to 99% of indoor air bacteria, circulating up to 250 m3 of air every hour. Plus, you may choose from 8000 LED color tones to set your current mood light.


SOL-ONE is made out of 4+1 basic parts. The stand and the cover makes out the housing, inside the housing there's the filter, the fan and the electronics board, which is also the module platform. Below the air filter is a water tank and you can add additional modules to the module platform, that can either ionize or scent your air.



SOL-ONE consumes up to 10 Watts of electricity on its full capacity, which is about as much, as an energy saver light bulb's consumption and it was designed to require only occasional maintenance. Since it has a washable air filter, you only have to wash out the filter and refill the water supply every 7 days. Consider it as one of your flowers, that needs watering. 

SOL-ONE's main filtering feature is that it can and should run 24/7 even at night on a super silent 25 dB (lowest) fan noise. 
Another cool feature is that it can be completely automated. You can set environment-aware air cleaning, as SOL-ONE takes an air sample every few seconds and measures the amount of ventilation strength needed. The worse the air quality, the higher the fans output will be. You can also schedule when to enter sleeping/silent mode and how often you want to scent your room.



When designing SOL-ONE our aim was to create an aesthetically most pleasing shape. Actually, it was only after we designed its shape, that we knew SOL-ONE needs to see daylight. You can compare it to many natural forms, for some people it looks like a vase, others think it's more like a human curve, but for us it's like a fresh raindrop in the air! In one word SOL-ONE is decoration!


As we browsed through countless air purifiers available on the market, we have realized most devices are unattractive and should be hidden away from the eyes. SOL-ONE is different, SOL-ONE is like a beautiful sculpture and more like a warm piece of fine art than just a coldly engineered machine.




SOL-ONE is built to be simple and great, you won't find any panel sticking out on its surface, there aren't any useless buttons or switches that could break its curves and there are definitely no extra remote controls lying around, just you and the purely natural curves.



SOL-ONE comes in four colors: red, black, gold and white, plus there's a true gold housing for the neediest. For most living rooms the best choice is white, while in bedrooms the black may provide the best relaxing experience, but the choice is absolutely yours.  



When you choose to pre-order a SOL-ONE you CANNOT directly choose your preferred color, but DON'T WORRY, we will contact you and sort out all the details after the campaign!


Customize your SOL-ONE by asking for an individual painted design. If you wish, we can make yours look unlike like any other!

Just send us your high resolution image and we will calculate you the best price to get you the desired looks during the standard shipping period (October).

</h3>The BENCH BUSTR™ Team is made of three member all into health and fitness, John, Ginny &amp; D!<br/><br/>BENCH BUSTR™ Team Member John from Brooklyn, NY  began weight training as a teen, later becoming a competitive bodybuilder - winning titles from his first show, Dan Lurie's, Mr. Brooklyn to NPC's Atlantic States class winner - three years in a row, as well as the NPC's Amateur Grand Prix class winner.  He has trained and was a personal trainer in all levels of gyms:  Old school lifting gyms, on the sands of California's Venice Beach to the most elite NYC fitness centers. <br/><br/>It was at a local gym the concept of the BENCH BUSTR™ was envisioned, John went to use the bench press machine and saw the previous user walking away.  The previous user had severe acne on his upper back and shoulders, and left behind a sweaty bench. John proceeded to wipe down the bench before his workout and to his ultimate disgust – found blood on the paper towel!  He decided then and there to take matters into his own hands - creating the     concept of the BENCH BUSTR™ - to ""Share the Gym,  Not the Germs™""!   <br/><br/>It was when John spoke of his concept with now Team Member Ginny, that the BENCH BUSTR™ became a reality.  Team Member Ginny understood the importance of germ protection. She lost a 
loved one from an infection caught while in the hospital.  Yes, a 
hospital!  If you can catch a deadly infection in a HOSPITAL, just 
imagine what you can catch in a GYM!  This is why
we are also donating a portion of each pledge to the Committee to

The BENCH BUSTR™ Team is made of three member all into health and fitness, John, Ginny & D!BENCH BUSTR™ Team Member John from Brooklyn, NY  began weight training as a teen, later becoming a competitive bodybuilder - winning titles from his first show, Dan Lurie's, Mr. Brooklyn to NPC's Atlantic States class winner - three years in a row, as well as the NPC's Amateur Grand Prix class winner.  He has trained and was a personal trainer in all levels of gyms:  Old school lifting gyms, on the sands of California's Venice Beach to the most elite NYC fitness centers. It was at a local gym the concept of the BENCH BUSTR™ was envisioned, John went to use the bench press machine and saw the previous user walking away.  The previous user had severe acne on his upper back and shoulders, and left behind a sweaty bench. John proceeded to wipe down the bench before his workout and to his ultimate disgust – found blood on the paper towel!  He decided then and there to take matters into his own hands - creating the     concept of the BENCH BUSTR™ - to ""Share the Gym,  Not the Germs™""!   It was when John spoke of his concept with now Team Member Ginny, that the BENCH BUSTR™ became a reality.  Team Member Ginny understood the importance of germ protection. She lost a 
loved one from an infection caught while in the hospital.  Yes, a 
hospital!  If you can catch a deadly infection in a HOSPITAL, just 
imagine what you can catch in a GYM!  This is why
we are also donating a portion of each pledge to the Committee to 
Reduce Infection Deaths - RID with each pledge made toward BENCH BUSTR™. So protect yourself while contributing to
 make hospitals a safer place. 
Ginny's belief, backing and support provided the opportunities for patents, 
prototypes, designs, samples and then the perfect final product today!  
Ginny and Team Member D joined forces to bring you the  best and safest
 solution to keep you safer 
while working out as well as keeping the price down to make it 
affordable to everyone.  There has been no expensive outside 
consultants, photographers, advertisers, web designers, Just this 
Team!!!           Please Join Us In Busting The Germs With The BENCH BUSTR™
The BENCH BUSTR™  is your very own personal protective fitness
weight bench cover.  Its specially designed impervious backing, as used in the medical field,  is SGS certified.  It is this backing that helps
eliminate the chances of coming into contact with someone else's sweat and body
fluids left behind on padded gym surfaces. The     BENCH BUSTR™ is also durable, has a
soft comfortable absorbent terry cloth surface, an adaptable elastic perimeter,
is light weight and fits over a majority of padded gym equipment. It just make sense!

We are proud that you and your fitness friends can join us in offering this awesome product,

He plans to use his unique skill with numbers to guarantee company profitability and assess future investments.</p><p>We plan to hire two full time persons, 3 bi-lingual personal trainers, and a bi-lingual chef. We have already communicated with some very strong candidates. We will initiate the hiring process closer to our official backer launch in March of 2019.</p><p> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Risks/Challenges for us:</strong></h2><p> </p><p>One potential challenge we face is raising the $50K we need to fully launch at the scale we are hoping for. We are extremely hard workers and passionate about this business.</p><p>One of our biggest hurdles is securing the luxury apartments, making the down payments, and first month rents. Without the $50K start-up, we will need to launch with a smaller amount of available bookings each month.</p><p> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Why we are different:</h2><p> </p><p>Our niche is that we specifically cater to those who can work online, from anywhere. Other programs have their schedules too packed to be able to juggle both work obligations and fitness challenges. We will be that unique solution for those who notice that working from home is taking a toll on their midsection, and intend to make a change.</p><p>We are also different in terms of value. We aren't extremely cheap, but what we offer is second to none. We know that if you research other weight-loss and fitness vacation options you will find many spas, resorts, and fitness retreats that charge top dollar; without options longer than 7 or 10 days. Longer stays result in locking in the improvements.</p><p>We know we will grow extremely fast once the word gets out. Fortunately, we know the city extremely well, have the connections, and resources to handle that increased demand.</p><p> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Who should sign up:</strong></h2><p> </p><p>There’s a saying that goes, “Losing weight is hard. Being over-weight is hard. Pick your hard.”</p><p>We think it’s totally true. It is never easy to lose weight. If you have the drive to better yourself and start changing your lifestyle, for yourself, your family, and others, there is no better time to sign up for a life changing experience than right now.</p><p> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Who should help us:</strong></h2><p> </p><p>We obviously want people to pick Nomad Fitness Club but also want the entire weight loss tourism industry to grow as well. In our opinion, people want to travel and lose weight on these travels OR at least know they won’t gain weight. If you are moved by what we are doing or passionate about travel, fitness, food, or weight loss we'd really appreciate your help!</p><p><strong>You should definitely help us if you plan or are contemplating a trip with Nomad Fitness Club at any point because the savings we are offering now, will not be offered down the road. </strong></p><p>By supporting us through the crowdfunding campaign we are giving you the opportunity to save 10-25% off our normal pricing. Considering that a 25% discount could correlate into savings of $2325 on a 28 day trip, it's a no brainer to grab that perk now, when you still can.</p><p> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Our Values:</strong></h2><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>We believe in transparency and business ethics.</u></h3><p> </p><p>This is why our coupon codes will never expire AND can be transferrable. We hope any backer with a code eventually gets to vacation with us but we do understand circumstances happen in life that are sometimes unpredictable.

We have already communicated with some very strong candidates. We will initiate the hiring process closer to our official backer launch in March of 2019. Risks/Challenges for us: One potential challenge we face is raising the $50K we need to fully launch at the scale we are hoping for. We are extremely hard workers and passionate about this business.One of our biggest hurdles is securing the luxury apartments, making the down payments, and first month rents. Without the $50K start-up, we will need to launch with a smaller amount of available bookings each month. Why we are different: Our niche is that we specifically cater to those who can work online, from anywhere. Other programs have their schedules too packed to be able to juggle both work obligations and fitness challenges. We will be that unique solution for those who notice that working from home is taking a toll on their midsection, and intend to make a change.We are also different in terms of value. We aren't extremely cheap, but what we offer is second to none. We know that if you research other weight-loss and fitness vacation options you will find many spas, resorts, and fitness retreats that charge top dollar; without options longer than 7 or 10 days. Longer stays result in locking in the improvements.We know we will grow extremely fast once the word gets out. Fortunately, we know the city extremely well, have the connections, and resources to handle that increased demand. Who should sign up: There’s a saying that goes, “Losing weight is hard. Being over-weight is hard. Pick your hard.”We think it’s totally true. It is never easy to lose weight. If you have the drive to better yourself and start changing your lifestyle, for yourself, your family, and others, there is no better time to sign up for a life changing experience than right now. Who should help us: We obviously want people to pick Nomad Fitness Club but also want the entire weight loss tourism industry to grow as well. In our opinion, people want to travel and lose weight on these travels OR at least know they won’t gain weight. If you are moved by what we are doing or passionate about travel, fitness, food, or weight loss we'd really appreciate your help!You should definitely help us if you plan or are contemplating a trip with Nomad Fitness Club at any point because the savings we are offering now, will not be offered down the road. By supporting us through the crowdfunding campaign we are giving you the opportunity to save 10-25% off our normal pricing. Considering that a 25% discount could correlate into savings of $2325 on a 28 day trip, it's a no brainer to grab that perk now, when you still can. Our Values: We believe in transparency and business ethics. This is why our coupon codes will never expire AND can be transferrable. We hope any backer with a code eventually gets to vacation with us but we do understand circumstances happen in life that are sometimes unpredictable. However long down the road it may be, we will still honor the reduced rate for a friend, acquittance, or relative of yours if you choose to pass them your exclusive discount. Other ways you can help: We recognize that not everyone can help us financially. However, we would appreciate any assistance you can provide, such as sharing our campaign to your social media followers, or sending it directly to friends you believe may be interested. Do not forget to check out us at www.nomadfitnessclub.com to keep up to date with the latest news and happenings around our business. Additional Trip Info:",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></section></div>","LifePod is the only voice-first caregiving service designed to improve the quality of life for caregivers and their loved ones by monitoring and supporting their daily routines to help them thrive as they age-in-place. Offering a personalized, voice-enabled service built on top of popular smart-speaker technology, LifePod proactively assists family members and caregivers with managing a senior’s day-to-day schedule, medications, appointments, activities, and entertainment – from listening to their favorite music or watching their favorite TV show.


Improving the Quality of Life for Seniors and Caregivers


Check-Ins
Friendly, personalized check-ins to ensure everything is “ok”.


Reminders
Help with remembering important events and activities, medications, appointments, and birthdays.


Voice Services
Easy access to online services via smart speakers: weather, news, music, games, therapy, and more.


 


Companionship
Improves social interaction and combats loneliness by telling jokes or trivia, reading audiobooks, and playing games.


Alerts
Easily configures instant alerts and daily reports summarizing activities for the caregiving team as needed.


...and More

How LifePod Works
LifePod expands the capabilities of popular smart speakers with proactive voice technology, providing an easy-to-use voice service for seniors aging in place. Unlike traditional voice assistants, LifePod can be set up and controlled by a remote family caregiver using LifePod's Caregiver service that supports personalized voice check-ins, reminders, and virtual companionship.



All the senior user needs to do is speak!


Good morning, Rose, this is LifePod. Did you remember to take your pills with breakfast?




Yes, I did


That's good to hear. Don’t forget that ""The Price Is Right"" starts in 5 minutes!




Ok, Thank you


And if Rose isn't feeling well, it could say something else…


Good morning, Rose, this is LifePod. Did you remember to take your pills with breakfast?




No, I didn't


Ok, please take your pills now, you know it will make Kelly happy!  And don’t forget that ""The Price Is Right"" starts in 5 minutes.




Ok, I will. Thank you

</p><p><b>Short
Summary</b></p>
<p>My
name is Brooke Brown, and I am a volunteer at Austin Child Guidance Center (ACGC). As
a graduate student pursuing professional counseling, I am passionate about
mental health and supportive of those in our community who meet the mental
health needs of our underserved citizens. This is why I want to build a labyrinth–a research-proven tool with therapeutic value–for ACGC.   </p>
<p>Austin
Child Guidance Center is a nonprofit that serves over 3,600 clients every year,
with 79% of its children and families living at or below 200% of the federal
poverty level. ACGC provides mental health care to every child in need
regardless of the family’s ability to pay. Through advocacy, workshops, and
therapy, ACGC ensures that Central Texas children are safe, accepted, and
unafraid. </p>
<p> ACGC’s services not only benefit the
clients that they serve, but they tremendously benefit the larger community.
Investing in children’s mental health is investing in a more productive state,
socially, academically and economically. ACGC supports the children in our
community so that they can be the future leaders that we need.    </p>
<p><b>What
We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>The money raised from this campaign will go
towards the construction of a meditation labyrinth for our children’s healing
garden. The image of this campaign displays what we envision the labyrinth to look like. Specifically, proceeds will go towards the labyrinth design template
($797.00), which will allow our volunteers easy and secure placing of each
labyrinth stone and will suppress weeds for minimal maintenance. The remaining
proceeds will go towards stepping stones for the labyrinth (around $2 each). I
have already raised $400- only $1,000 more to go!   </p>
<p>The
labyrinth, along with a donors’ plaque, will be permanently installed adjacent
to the center. All proceeds go directly to this project. With your
contribution, you are providing ACGC a research-proven resource that will last the
center forever. With your generosity, not only are you helping this year’s ACGC
clients, but clients and families for years to come.  </p>
<p><b>The
Impact</b></p>
<p>Labyrinths are widely used for therapeutic
purposes in schools, mental health facilities and hospitals. Among the many
benefits of labyrinths for mental health, ACGC therapist Dr. Louise Tedford
named the following reasons it would uniquely benefit ACGC clients: </p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Parent-child bonding, by parent and child working the
      labyrinth together and parents learning how to provide positive guidance
      throughout the task</li>
<li>Allowing children to be outdoors, since that is a much
      more rare opportunity in today’s world </li>
<li>Engaging in effective problem solving and feeling a
      sense of mastery at the task.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Labyrinths
have also been used to improve concentration (e.g. with children diagnosed with
ADHD) and to alleviate anxiety with children and adults.  </p>
<p><b>Risks
&amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>We
have the manpower, the expertise, and the support of the board for this project.
The only challenge we face is obtaining the materials needed to create a
sustainable labyrinth. </p>
<p><b>Other
Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>In
addition to financial contributions, in-kind donations of stepping stones for
the labyrinth are accepted. </p>
<p>Please
share, tweet, and post about this project, about the Austin Child Guidance
Center, and about the importance of mental health in general. Change starts with awareness, and with
a simple post, you can be a part of a movement to support mental health
services for those that need it the most. Thank you. </p>
