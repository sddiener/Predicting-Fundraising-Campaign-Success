</div><div>So, yea, I want to create a fun new generation tower defense game for mobiles. And if you like the idea, you can help me with this this.</div><div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>As I mentioned, I'm a coder. And in terms of code, the game is almost ready, I've been coding it for 8 months so far. But I need art, lots of art: 3d models of player towers and enemy mosnters, 2d art of interface and background images, VFX effects, also sounds and music. I'm capable of creating all of this, but it wont look or sound professional, and will take years to complete. For example, there will be more than 200 different units, each one requires a 3d model.</div> <p>Creating a good model would take 2-3 days, and the only way to complete the game in a reasonable time is to hire people to create the art.</p>
<p>An animated 3d model can cost $20-50, and this is the main case of spendings. The rest of the sum will be used for other kinds of art the game requires.</p>
<p>What I'd like to give in return. Besides the game itself and the fun it will bring, I'll suggest you to have:</p>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">have access to the extra builders (which let you go riskier and trickier way to the victory)</span><br/><ul>
<li>get some rare artifacts and spells (normally artifacts can be gained for victories or purchased for resources)</li>
<li>you can be involved in beta testing of the game, which will happen in about 2 months</li>
<li>you can participate in the game creation by suggesting names, look and unique specialities of the towers and enemy monsters</li>
<li>you can immortalize your name by putting it in the game's credits as a major donator</li>
</ul>If the goal will not be reached, I will still complete the game, but it will just take more time. I already have a couple of people who help me with art for free in their free time, and we will manage to release the game anyway.<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Further plans</h3>
<div>If this project is successful, I'll create one more game, a multiplayer one this time, that will make one more evolution step of the genre Mines and Magic belongs to.</div>
<h3>My previous projects</h3>
<div>
<p>In my days of SC2 mapmaking I created 6 major maps, they all are available at SC2 battlenet server under Arcade section:</p>
<ul>
<li>""Z remake"" - a remake of the good old game named Z.</li>
<li>""Heroes of Might and Magic"" - a remake of this famous RPG game as real time strategy.</li>
<li>""Civilization"" - yes, I remade civilization in SC2 with a great respect to the original game mechanics.</li>
<li>""Rise of Legends"" - another remake of a great RTS game.</li>
<li>""Glass Castle"" - I created this original game to test my TD genre ideas.</li>
<li>""Mines and Magic""</li>
</ul>The last one, Mines and Magic, is a game of the genre, that has a history of evolution. There was Legion TD map in Warcraft3 battlenet server. Then there was Squadron TD map in SC2. And finally I decided to make a new step, use all my game design skills to create a funniest TD ever, based on those maps, but combined with many ideas I had. And after a year of every day work Mines and Magic was released.<p></p>
<p>This map has become popular during one day, and never since left the first page of popular maps in SC2 battlenet.</p>
<p>The whole SC2 mapmaking experience gave me great gamedev skills, and has built my ability to successfully handle big projects alone.</p>I also created <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Zolden"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">some games</a> for android platform, which gave me the experience I needed to move further.</div>
<div>So, there's no chance I abandon this project, especially considering the fact, that technically the game is almost created, only the content, like art and level design is remaining.</div>

Why would I do this? Well, I want to make sure you get the best possible product. I also want to make sure that it arrives at your doorstep in one piece. So I decided to wait until after the crazy busy shipping season to get you your copies. Since you have to wait so long, I wanted to make sure we offered you some options for those who wanted to give these as Holiday gifts. Everyone who backs this project through one of the listed reward tiers will receive the digital print and play version of the game. This way you can print it out at home and give it a go before your physical cards arrive!</p><h3>#PLAYTESTITFORWARD</h3><p>Since this was the first card game I created, I wanted to be able to bring something new to the world of gaming. I knew it was going to be hard to get my game out there when there are thousands of them already in circulation. So I came up with the #playtestitforwardcampaign.</p><p>I reached out to various accounts on social media to see if they would be interested in playtesting the game early in development. I would ship them a copy of the game in a prototype Special edition case, and they would try it out and give me feedback. I would then send them a shipping label and they would send it on to the next house. </p><p>I was blown away by the response from the campaign. I couldn't believe that after 3 short months of running it, the games had been to over 50 different homes around the world! I have one in Australia, one in the UK, two in Canada and 5 traveling around the US. </p><p>It was a lot to handle, but in the end, it was a blast getting to talk with all of these wonderful gamers around the world. It is great to see how the love for collaboration and friendly (sometimes not so much ;) ) competition can bring us all together. I can't wait to use this campaign again in the future for all of the games that I come out with (yes, I have like 4-5 more already bouncing around). </p><p> </p><h3>Demo Sessions</h3><p>Over the last few weeks, I have gotten to attend some of the best small Cons and Expos on the East coast. Charcon 2018 was so great! For a small con, it sure had some dedicated gamers. Over the three day weekend, I barely got a few minutes to stop and breathe. The demo sessions were non-stop. Although it was crazy, I wouldn't have it any other way. I loved seeing the families or friends work together to survive the game.

There are some cool facts about the evolution of Build A Cure.</p><p>So the idea of the game was actually brought about because my Mother-in-law (Anne) wanted to have a game that she would enjoy playing with the rest of the family. We love games like Catan and Carcassonne but hadn't really dealt with anything deeper. We mainly dabbled in gateway games. So for her birthday, I decided I was going to make a game for her. Now my background is in computer science, so the chemistry of it was not a natural thought for me.</p><p>When I was brainstorming what the theme would be, I ended up always coming back to the idea that we are always fighting illnesses. It is one thing that we can never beat. It is also the science behind it that so quickly can bring together two completely different people. If they both suffer from the same disease, they will ignore all of their differences in order to come up with a Cure together. So the foundation of the game began to take form.</p><p> </p><p>Next, I knew that the mechanics needed to be solid. So I started to do some research and found a few dozen diseases that were known to be weaponized, because who doesn't love a conspiracy theory? Anyway, I found dozens of these diseases and the compounds/treatments/cures that corresponded to each one. I noticed pretty quickly that there were a few elements that were very common between the cures, so I did what any other computer science/engineer would do... I made a spreadsheet! Now, not only did I make a spreadsheet, but I formulated calculations that would help me determine the probability of occurrence and likelihood of duplication in a deck with 7 (of course it is my favorite number) other diseases.</p><p>After around 2,000 calculations I finally determined which diseases could be in the deck. I had to limit them to diseases that had 5 or fewer elements because, with any more, the game would be impossible to play. So I stuck with the basics: Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Sulfur.</p><p> </p><p>Now the great thing is these spreadsheets not only told me what diseases would be in the game, but how many of each element should be included to make it the minimal amount of cards, while still giving the opportunity to solve each disease once, if you happened to have the worst luck known to man and contract each disease found in the game!</p><p>So I printed out the cards and came up with the first deck. It was great, but there were multiple mechanics that I found just didn't work. For example, I included the charge of each atom for the first revision because the types of bonds will actually heavily rely on this aspect in the science of bonding. It was scientifically accurate but did not make for a fun game at all, so it was dropped fairly quickly. Although there were small changes that needed to happen, what we found was that the game was genuinely fun. </p><p>The mechanics worked so well starting off because the math was so solid. Now don't get me wrong, the game has changed so much since then, but the fact remains that each thing you change about a game is a calculation that must be taken into account as a game designer. Even if you think it is a small change, it has the potential to make or break your game.</p><p> </p><p>Anyway, since then, it has been playtested hundreds of times. I personally can't tell you how many times I have played the game. Thankfully I have dozens of games that I can sit back and be the GM. Now the unique thing about developing a cooperative game is that when I get to sit back and watch, I have the ""watch the world burn"" mentality. Since I made the game, every time someone loses, I kind of win. Haha now, this makes for some great banter between the players and myself at times. At times I can see how they are able to win, but I have to let them make the choices, so I just give them the disapproving father look when the just missed their chance to cure a disease.</p><p> </p><p>So I am sure if you made it to this point you know way more than you expected to know about the game. I applaud you for making it this far, but I guess I have to challenge you to beat the game *evil genius laugh*...</p><p> The film was edited by: Paul Hinton.</p><p>Sky Developed LLC © 2018</p><p>PLAY NOW!</p><p>Risks and challenges</p><p>This will be my 6th Kickstarter to share with you all.

However, the bunker that saved you was a storehouse for some of the world's worst diseases. The shockwave of the explosion caused the containment vials to break. It is up to you and your team to work together to build the chemical compounds to cure the diseases before you run out of resources. You may see your team experience symptoms and even contract more diseases that could hurt your chances of survival. Remember, the longer you stay, the more you are exposed. If you can manage to cure all of the diseases before you run out of resources, you win and can live to see another day.

We will be sure to post updates to all our backers as often as makes sense, but let's be real, you don't want an email every day from Kickstarter just to see what I am working on. That is where social media comes in! I post regularly to Instagram/Facebook/Twitter so you can see what's happening each day, without those pesky emails. BGG: CLICK HERETIMELINE As you will see, the timeline is fairly spread out. Why would I do this? Well, I want to make sure you get the best possible product. I also want to make sure that it arrives at your doorstep in one piece. So I decided to wait until after the crazy busy shipping season to get you your copies. Since you have to wait so long, I wanted to make sure we offered you some options for those who wanted to give these as Holiday gifts. Everyone who backs this project through one of the listed reward tiers will receive the digital print and play version of the game. This way you can print it out at home and give it a go before your physical cards arrive!#PLAYTESTITFORWARDSince this was the first card game I created, I wanted to be able to bring something new to the world of gaming. I knew it was going to be hard to get my game out there when there are thousands of them already in circulation. So I came up with the #playtestitforwardcampaign.I reached out to various accounts on social media to see if they would be interested in playtesting the game early in development. I would ship them a copy of the game in a prototype Special edition case, and they would try it out and give me feedback. I would then send them a shipping label and they would send it on to the next house. I was blown away by the response from the campaign. I couldn't believe that after 3 short months of running it, the games had been to over 50 different homes around the world! I have one in Australia, one in the UK, two in Canada and 5 traveling around the US. It was a lot to handle, but in the end, it was a blast getting to talk with all of these wonderful gamers around the world. It is great to see how the love for collaboration and friendly (sometimes not so much ;) ) competition can bring us all together. I can't wait to use this campaign again in the future for all of the games that I come out with (yes, I have like 4-5 more already bouncing around).  Demo SessionsOver the last few weeks, I have gotten to attend some of the best small Cons and Expos on the East coast. Charcon 2018 was so great! For a small con, it sure had some dedicated gamers. Over the three day weekend, I barely got a few minutes to stop and breathe. The demo sessions were non-stop. Although it was crazy, I wouldn't have it any other way. I loved seeing the families or friends work together to survive the game. We also made history with the first two uses(pics below) of the Ultimate Sacrifice card! Another great event was the Southern Fried Gaming Expo. It was a blast being a part of this multi-platform gaming group.

My art work has won international and national awards for digital and traditional painting. This year my work has been a finalist on four awards. Recently I was a finalist and won an award with the incredibly prestigious Art Olympia  in Tokyo Japan.  Through out all this my gaming mats have been a constant source of pride for me and a fan favourite. But I feel that I have never done them justice, never showcasing the full variety that my art makes possible. And so It is time to release these finalist and award winning artworks to the public with my largest range of gaming mats ever! Welcome to the Gaming Mat Spectacular!This project is so unique because for the first time I have 21 options right from the launch of my campaign. This is the most designs released all at once plus I will unlock new and never before printed gaming mats as stretch goals for you to purchase.  Every $750, 5 more options will unlock! Merlin and the Dragons Order from the Largest Range of my gaming mats and sizes!Great news I have found a new gaming mat supplier who I have been working with for the last month and they have created amazing gaming mats of my art. Even better news is they are allowing me no minimum order quantity. This means I can release more variety in my gaming mats, featuring artworks that have never been gaming mats plus past hits, including artworks that have been finalists and award winners.   The Greek Griffin Griffos is free and now available in all sizes and the art work is finishedAs a bonus option I have unlocked Cerridwen for fans Thank you to Tamika Miligan for modeling for this artYou may say why gaming mats?Gaming mats are one of my most popular products and I constantly have fans asking for their favourite of my art to be a gaming mat. However previously this was impossible due to limitations set by my past supplier. Fortunately I found the most amazing supplier who has no minimum order quantity on each design. The quality is amazing and will allow me to offer more sizes! I have had so many PC gamers ask for larger sizes for their desktops and I am so glad with this indiegogo I can finally say yes, I can. I want to release as many as possible.  This is your chance to get the exact art work and dimension you need and to grab gaming mats that are exclusive and limited edition.Many GenresPreviously nearly all my gaming mats have been my more well know fantasy and fairy tale art. But I have a much wider range of art that I have created over the years, including my other favourite themes of Horror, Mythology and Science fiction, which I can now also offer. SIZE OPTIONSRegular Gaming Mat 35 x 60cm  Featuring edge stitching for added durability.  Large Gaming Mat 40x70cm Featuring edge stitching for added durability. Extra Large- 40x80cm. For the PC Gamer or Tabletop Adventure!Featuring edge stitching for added durability.  The New Designs!Ship Portal (Escaping Climate Change is a fantasy)  Finalist on the Lethbridge Art Prize June 2019Griffin - Opening Portals to many dimensions!

<h3>What is KARMA?</h3>
<p>KARMA is a brand new story roleplaying game from Frenzy Kitty Games. The game is designed for 3-5 players and each session plays in about 2 hours. Additionally, there is no game master required - each player takes turns framing and directing scenes and having agency over the narrative. </p>
<p>KARMA features a brand new GM-less engine known as the KARMA system. In this system other players will get to add a complication to your scenes (thus keeping everyone engaged in every scene, even when their character is not present) and each player tracks their KARMA throughout the game, which will have an impact on how their finale plays out. It is a  game where good and bad people get what they deserve... usually.</p>
<p>In KARMA, you and your friends will choose from a variety of story modules, each of which comes with its own set of unique characters, relationships and worldbuilding options. These modules are customized every time you play, so no two games will ever be the same.</p>
<p>The game requires zero preparation - all you need is the book, some character sheets and a handful of six-sided dice and you're ready to tell an amazing, engaging and dramatic story.</p>
<p>KARMA features 8 modules (with more potentially unlocked through this campaign):</p>
<ul>
<li>BLACK FRIDAY</li>
<li>THE HAUNTING</li>
<li>THE COLD WINDS OF CHUQUISACA</li>
<li>THE LOOT DILEMMA</li>
<li>FROSTMEAD HIGH</li>
<li>THE DESCENT</li>
<li>GEMINI</li>
<li>PARADISE</li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you for your interest in KARMA.</p>

<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<p>The game is already written and ready to go, but that doesn't mean that we wouldn't like to see even more value packed in! Here are some of our planned stretch goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>$800 (funded): ""How to Play"" Video Tutorial <strong>[UNLOCKED!]</strong>
</li>
<li>$1000 ""THE JOB"" (working title) module by Rodney Sloan (Rising Phoenix Games &amp; Fat Goblin Games)<strong>[UNLOCKED!]</strong>
</li>
<li>$2000: ""THE PLAGUE"" module by jim pinto (Post World Games)</li>
<li>$3000: ""TRIBUNAL"" module by Gareth H. Graham</li>
</ul>
<p>We will add more stretch goals once these are unlocked! How exciting!</p>
<h3>Timeline</h3>
<p>If we fund, we will send all the backers the current beta version of the game in PDF format via DriveThruRPG. Once you've got that in your hands, we will spend the next 4 weeks finishing up the book by adding in any extra content, stretch goals and artwork. Once that is done, you will all immediately be sent your updated PDF copies (updated files on DriveThruRPG). While you enjoy your digital copies of KARMA, we will be carefully examining our proof copy of the softcover from the printers before shipping your physical copies off to you!</p>
<h3>Referral Rewards</h3>
<p>We appreciate it a hell of a lot (more than you know) when you share the campaign on social media. Spreading the word is how we can get this game funded! We appreciate it so much that we want to reward you for doing it, so we are launching Referral Rewards!</p>
<p>Firstly, you need to be a backer of KARMA and signed in to your Indiegogo account (this is so we have your email address to send you your rewards). Then all you need to do is share the campaign using the social media buttons on the campaign page.</p>
<p>If you get 5 people to back the campaign through your links, then you will be gifted the entire DUSK bundle on DriveThruRPG. DUSK is our post apocalyptic roleplaying game which was released last year to a fantastic reception.</p>
<p>So log in, share and earn those delicious rewards! Thank you for helping us to make this campaign a success!</p>

KARMA is a brand new story roleplaying game from Frenzy Kitty Games. The game is designed for 3-5 players and each session plays in about 2 hours. Additionally, there is no game master required - each player takes turns framing and directing scenes and having agency over the narrative. 
KARMA features a brand new GM-less engine known as the KARMA system. In this system other players will get to add a complication to your scenes (thus keeping everyone engaged in every scene, even when their character is not present) and each player tracks their KARMA throughout the game, which will have an impact on how their finale plays out. It is a  game where good and bad people get what they deserve... usually.
In KARMA, you and your friends will choose from a variety of story modules, each of which comes with its own set of unique characters, relationships and worldbuilding options. These modules are customized every time you play, so no two games will ever be the same.
The game requires zero preparation - all you need is the book, some character sheets and a handful of six-sided dice and you're ready to tell an amazing, engaging and dramatic story.
KARMA features 8 modules (with more potentially unlocked through this campaign):

BLACK FRIDAY
THE HAUNTING
THE COLD WINDS OF CHUQUISACA
THE LOOT DILEMMA
FROSTMEAD HIGH
THE DESCENT
GEMINI
PARADISE


The game is already written and laid out - this campaign will help us add more artwork and content and make KARMA the best it can be!
Thank you for your interest in KARMA.

Beyond the Trispyre
All backers will also receive a copy of our brand new fantasy RPG, Beyond the Trispyre!

<p>Welcome to <strong>10,000 TOKENS for RPG on Indiegogo</strong>. My aim is to create ten thousand NEW fantasy-based furniture, decor, infrastructure, vehicular, nature-themed tokens to suit fantasy-themed RPG's in a top-down photo-realistic art style. My present collection is approximately a few thousand but I would like to attempt a truly massive and comprehensive set that provides virtually everything a fantasy setting needs in one pack. Not only that - but this project was just funded on Kickstarter so it is definitely going ahead.</p>
<p>Making tokens is difficult, pain-staking work that requires making every small detail from scratch such as digitally creating a jug - then a piece of fruit, then a few more pieces of fruit, then a bowl to go underneath it, then making those pieces look like they belong in the bowl using correct shadow and lighting, then adding that arrangement to a table so the bowl looks like it is sitting on the table and so on - just a few simple pieces like that can take a few hours to initially create. Once however, the jug is created, (a single digital element) it can be more easily modified and re-used in other arrangements (cluster) - but even so it requires thousands of such small details to be created so that there is enough variation not to recognize an element frequently. With the creation of each element it becomes easier to make new clusters but this work is not for everyone and requires great attention to detail, digital software skill and artistic finesse to look decent. I usually specialize in maps but over the 4 years I have been working in this industry it became a frequent requirement to create tokens for those maps so now I am finally turning my attention directly to these little creatures to make the worlds biggest single set.</p>
<p>My 10,000 tokens will be provided as individual hi-quality PNG tokens sized and ready to go for Roll20 and Fantasy Grounds Virtual Table Top Programs (Inc Unity) formats both of which backers will be given access to so they can choose the best format for the job.  My current/previous tokens (and maps) are presently available from Roll20, Fantasy Grounds, D20pro, Steam and from my website Game Tile Warehouse. Here are some existing examples of my tokens art style: </p>

<p>And here is a snapshot of some of the 950 tokens already completed for previous campaigns, token packs or projects to give some indication of just how many I have made: though I also have a set on my website with 1100+ which is different altogether as well and would estimate my collection at around 5000 or more. But I intend to make 10,000 totally new ones. Tokens will be high-res, scaleable, and individually supplied and well categorized and named.</p>

<p>In the course of making more than 1000 battle-maps in the past four years, I have created a vast range of fantasy tokens - possibly already more than ten thousand, but I have never made a concerted effort to focus on tokens and I want to really expand these and cover thousands of tokens I feel are missing from the range: more of everything and 90% new tokens inc:<strong> traps, treasures, relics, doors, obstacles, hazards, statues, furnishings, adornments, campsites and equipment, natural features, and virtually every item an adventurer can expect to encounter with stylings from the very rich to the dirt poor - from finely crafted to make-shift, to broken or side-on</strong>. I want to have a versatile, enormous token set range to match the vast dungeon tile and battle map collection I already offer. <strong>I want to create more tokens to suit Sewers, Armories, Tombs, Professions Shops, City Trash, Cobwebbed/Burned/Broken Decor for Ruins and Abandoned Places, Underwater, Rusted, and extensive furnishings for popular folk such as Elven, Orcish, Dwarvish.  </strong></p>
<p>My aim is to select an area such as a Battlefield for instance and craft 200 or so tokens dedicated to its thematic requirements: in this case, from below we might expect battering rams, ballistas, siege engines, arrow shields, wall ladders, corpses, armarments, banners, trenches that you can just drop down to create the illusion of dug-out ground, supplies and ammunitions - while from the defending side we might wish for vats of boiling oil, spiked caltrops, huge crossbows, and other defenses to be dropped from the castle walls - while in the middle it might be nice to have an open gate, closed gate, then a version with a heavily defended castle gate, then a version of it smashed, and burning, + a drawbridge raised and lowered offering maximum versatility for story-telling. Meanwhile the Castle would constitute another area requiring 200 or so tokens, the Village would require 200, the farm 200, the treasury 200, the baker, stables etc  - you get the idea - would all get a similar treatment carefully looking at what needs be represented and building enough tokens for virtually every RPG scenario. Vehicles too - LOTS of armored,  travel convoy, wagons, carts, boats, small ships - and much much more. (The 200 is just an estimate, if an area needs more to represent it fully, it will get more).</p>
<p>My goal is to have them all done by September 2020. </p>
<p> <strong>EARLY ACCESS</strong>: Backing this campaign will give you the tokens months (possibly a year) before I package them for sale on the numerous stores I have my products which can take me months alone to organize, package and release due to the many formats required to suit so many different stores including the creation of samples, graphics, promotional materials.</p>
<p> <strong>SAVINGS:</strong> It will give you an incredibly massive saving on retail cost as this Kickstarter is in AUD and my products retail in USD at approx 150 tokens per set for between $9.99/$12.99 USD a set and If you break that down it would require around 66 packs at $9.95 USD ea or $656 USD for all 66, which is the equivalent of a minimum of $937 in AUD for all 10,000 tokens.</p>
<p> <strong>Backer Involvement:</strong> There is PLENTY of room for backers to get involved and feel free to make suggestions that I will do my best to include in the 10k.</p>
<p>I've made the worlds largest modular battlemap series (MEANDERS @1000+), and the worlds largest modular dungeon tile set (SOLOMAN TEMPLE SQUARES @46,000+) now its time to make the gigantic token set that goes with them.</p>
<p><strong>Map Bonuses</strong> - Since I also do maps (LOTS. OF. MAPS.) I am offering some freebies to those backers that pledge in the first week, with diminishing rewards the later the backing - but still cool. I'll provide a series of highly-detailed map templates on which you can put your new tokens.</p>
<p><strong> Pre-Selection: </strong>Letting X amount of people select from 10k tokens would be a logistical nightmare so you have to trust that as a DM, gamer, businessman, thinker and strategist myself I will choose the best selections possible for each reward level to cover the broadest requirements.</p>
<p> <strong>Naming of tokens:</strong> I'm intimately familiar with Fantasy Grounds UI and the importance of naming convention when it comes to how to quickly identify items in those little bag icons when you have thousands. Fantasy Grounds has its own search function that allows you to filter out specific items from thousands so I will be carefully labelling each component to make it easy to find. - Roll20 has its own tag system but can also benefit from detailed labelling - so in both cases tokens would be described from major or minor detail ie ""Barrel, Top, Burned, 03""  - so you search for barrel, you know this one features a lid, that the lid is burned, and that there are other versions available as this is number 03, there must be more.</p>
<p><strong> Delivery Organization:</strong> Furthermore as per usual tokens will be grouped into folders on my googledrive into individual sets - but I will also create a super zip that allows all of the folders to be downloaded at once - and a zip that includes all tokens with no folders as alternate options for people to best choose what type of file they prefer.  As time has gone by I have come to understand what is required for tokens by customers and will endeavour to provide maximum use with minimum fuss.</p>
<p> <strong>Integration/Instructions:</strong> As a teacher on how to use Fantasy Grounds, creator of several advanced modules and dozens of map and tokens ones I will be providing clear instructions on how to best import and store your tokens within Fantasy Grounds - and also Roll20. I cannot sync these tokens with products later formed into products for retail sale but I can organize them in such a way that they are immediately usable and virtually identical to those later products for the user.</p>
<p><strong> Versatility:</strong> While the tokens are sized for optimal use within Fantasy Grounds (100,200,400px) or Roll20 (140px,280px,560px) for instance - these tokens are supplied in a PNG format. What that means is that they have a transparent background - whereas a JPG does not. So if your intended program for using these whether its a map maker, different VTT, or other visual software usually uses PNG files as tokens - you're in business and can use these with it. </p>
<p> <strong>Mutual Combination:</strong> Note that you'll be given the master folder to Both Roll20 and Fantasy Grounds token formats, you don't have to choose: but you would select the Roll20 variants for home-printing or just printing as they will have the better resolution.</p>
<p> + Back in the first week and you'll also get my Nine Level Empty Wizard Tower Template, Eight Empty College of Magic Templates, and Four Poor Village Map Templates as a free bonus - perfect for adding your new tokens to.  And just for viewing this campaign here is a free sample of my traditional ""Meanders: Synchable Terrain"" battlemaps so you can see the level of detail and artistic style for yourself. : <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gPVYaBFrG4Mx44udBgNpBoXvDWsuj949/view"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gPVYaBFrG4Mx44...</a></p>

<p>To date I've created maybe ten thousand individual tokens in my career - but many of these lacked the skill I have now -and have been an aside while I was focusing mainly on maps. I intend to take a reasonable amount of time to work on producing these and am confident of doing so, as stated, and delivered on time. I have completed dozens of these massive types of digital project and have numerous measures in place to ensure the completed tokens are immediately stored in several places so they cannot suffer due to a hardware crash. I have made a move away from providing tokens on sheets, to individual drop-shadowed PNGS sized and ready to go within the two most popular VTT formats with both of which I am very familiar. There are no third parties involved and I have four years of Kickstarter experience and 100% fulfilment across more than a dozen projects - but this is my first time using Indiegogo, so bear with me while I get to grips.</p>
<p>No-one in their right mind offers this amount of tokens let alone tries to create them in one set - but I'm different and I'm known as 'The Maphatter' - and this is nothing compared to the 20 other projects I have successfully crowdfunded all including huge, vast amounts of digital content, including a recent project that saw 46,000 dungeon tiles created, or my Meanders series which now features over 1000 interchangeable battle-maps. - all delivered to promise and before time. I am what they call a sure-bet, I'm not going anywhere and this is not my beginning - but it is my beginning here: more funds means I can supplement myself while I work (fast and furious), hyper-focus on this one and not have to launch new projects in the meantime to pay my bills/rent - and possibly, make enough funding to include 10,000 sci-fi tokens as well. This is happening - I'm presently completing new maps for another project but as my backers know, I work like a storm and you don't have to wait long to get results once I get to it so this is your chance to get on board and get a wickedly comprehensive token set for your digital games this year - and you may never have to buy another one, again.</p>
<p>There are minimal risks and challenges beyond navigating Indiegogo for the first time - I've done this many times for many projects, I back-up everything so it can't be lost on multiple places, I know the formats required for the end-user, I make delivery as simple as visiting a link to download your goodies, I always deliver to promise early or on time, and I never ghost - I approach crowdfunding as a business transaction and pride myself on being a consummate professional before, during and after. My record (on record) reflects that.</p>
<p>Thanks for viewing, please feel free to ask any questions</p>
<p>First Regards,</p>

There are minimal risks and challenges beyond navigating Indiegogo for the first time - I've done this many times for many projects, I back-up everything so it can't be lost on multiple places, I know the formats required for the end-user, I make delivery as simple as visiting a link to download your goodies, I always deliver to promise early or on time, and I never ghost - I approach crowdfunding as a business transaction and pride myself on being a consummate professional before, during and after. My record (on record) reflects that.

<p><strong>Welcome to Dark Fable Miniature's Sons of Anubis Campaign.  These dog-headed warriors are descended from Anubis, the canine guide and guardian of the Egyptian underworld.  The Sons of Anubis are ferocious warriors sworn to protect the royal necropolis where the tombs of long dead pharaohs and queens can be found.  On rare occasions the Sons of Anubis have been summoned by powerful lords or heroes to wreak vengeance on those who would offend the gods.  Heavily armed and protected by sturdy shields and armour the Sons of Anubis make a formidable force on the battlefield.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sons of Anubis campaign is the latest expansion of Dark Fable's pseudo-historical Egyptian range.  The concept and design of the miniatures are a mix of history, archaeology, fantasy fiction and Hollywood films.  The core group of miniatures consists of 7 sets: 5 sets of fearsome Anubis warriors sculpted by Kev Adams.  A set of Scorpion warriors sculpted by Tim Prow.  As well as a two-stage female genie made by Brother Vinni.  There is also a stretch goal reward figure - The Scorpion Lord - who is FREE to all Level 5 contributors and higher when the campaign goal of £2000 is reached.  If that were not enough we have made a large selection of our previously released miniatures available as ADD-ONs.</strong></p>
<p><strong>These high-quality 28mm miniatures are made from a lead-free pewter alloy and have an incredible amount of detail and personality. Whether you are a collector or gamer you are certain to enjoy these figures!</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Sons of Anubis features seven new sets of miniatures!  Each set comes with plastic slotta bases and shields where appropriate.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>The Scorpion Lord Stretch Goal Reward</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Contributors of Level 5 and above will receive a FREE Scorpion Lord miniature as a stretch goal reward when the campaign goal of £2000 is reached.  After the Scorpion Lord has been unlocked he may also be purchased as an Add-on by adding £5 to your perk amount.</strong></p>

<p><strong>There are a variety of perks to suit every budget, which range in price from £12 to £240 (As well as two Early Bird Specials!).  Each perk allows you to choose from the 7 new sets of miniatures on offer and any of the £8 add-on sets which were released during our previous Indiegogo campaigns.  The miniatures are unpainted and most come with plastic slotta bases.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What scale are these miniatures and what are they made of?</strong></p>
<p>Most of our miniatures are 28-30mm tall, measuring from the base of the foot to the eye.  Because we use a number of different sculptors there may be a degree of variation between sets of figures.  The miniatures are made from a lead-free pewter alloy and are expertly spin cast by Griffin Moulds here in England.</p>
<p><strong>How much is postage?</strong></p>
<p>Postage will be added to your perk during checkout and is based on your location.  Please contact me regarding rates.</p>
<p><strong>When can I expect to get my miniatures?</strong></p>
<p>I am hoping to be able to start mailing out orders by January 2018 if not earlier.  The first two master moulds have already been made as well as several production moulds which should allow me to get the miniatures cast relatively quickly.  If there are any delays I will be sure to let you all know exactly what is going on and how long it might take.</p>
<p><strong>How do I let you know which sets I have chosen for my perk?</strong></p>
<p>You can either send me a message through the Indiegogo site or an email with your selections to <a href=""mailto:mikeburns64@aol.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">mikeburns64@aol.com</a>.  You can do this right away if you know which sets you want, or you can wait until the end of the campaign.</p>
<p><strong>I want to increase my perk level, how do I do this?</strong></p>
<p>Indiegogo does not have an application which enables you to do this yourself.  If you wish to increase your perk level make an additional contribution for the amount which is the difference between the two perks.  For example if you contributed £62 for the level 7 perk and decided you wanted to get the level 8 perk which is £85 you would contribute an additional £23.  You will then need to send me a message about your perk upgrade.</p>
<p><strong>If you have any questions about any aspect of the campaign please send me a message and I will do my best to answer you.</strong></p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><strong>Dark Fable Miniatures has previously conducted six Indiegogo campaigns - all of which were successfully funded and fulfilled.  This campaign is Fixed Funding so if we do not reach our campaign goal (Gods Forbid!) your contribution will be returned to you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The risks for this campaign are minimal as all of the miniatures have already been sculpted.  We are presently in the process of having the green sculpts made into castings - Production moulds will then be made for each set.  We are therefore confident that we can start sending out orders by the middle of January, if not earlier.  If there are any unforeseen delays or problems I will let you know immediately and what we are doing about it.</strong></p>
</div></div>","Welcome to Dark Fable Miniature's Sons of Anubis Campaign.  These dog-headed warriors are descended from Anubis, the canine guide and guardian of the Egyptian underworld.  The Sons of Anubis are ferocious warriors sworn to protect the royal necropolis where the tombs of long dead pharaohs and queens can be found.  On rare occasions the Sons of Anubis have been summoned by powerful lords or heroes to wreak vengeance on those who would offend the gods.  Heavily armed and protected by sturdy shields and armour the Sons of Anubis make a formidable force on the battlefield.
The Sons of Anubis campaign is the latest expansion of Dark Fable's pseudo-historical Egyptian range.  The concept and design of the miniatures are a mix of history, archaeology, fantasy fiction and Hollywood films.  The core group of miniatures consists of 7 sets: 5 sets of fearsome Anubis warriors sculpted by Kev Adams.  A set of Scorpion warriors sculpted by Tim Prow.  As well as a two-stage female genie made by Brother Vinni.  There is also a stretch goal reward figure - The Scorpion Lord - who is FREE to all Level 5 contributors and higher when the campaign goal of £2000 is reached.  If that were not enough we have made a large selection of our previously released miniatures available as ADD-ONs.
These high-quality 28mm miniatures are made from a lead-free pewter alloy and have an incredible amount of detail and personality. Whether you are a collector or gamer you are certain to enjoy these figures!
 

The Sons of Anubis features seven new sets of miniatures!  Each set comes with plastic slotta bases and shields where appropriate.

1. Anubis Warriors I (Spears)

2. Anubis Warriors II (Axes and Mace)

3. Anubis Warriors III (Swords in Scale Armour)

4. Anubis Warriors IV (Swords in Linen Armour)

5. Anubis Warriors V Command (Officer, Musician, Standard)

6. Scorpion Warriors

7. Female Genie (Two-stage Character)
 
The Scorpion Lord Stretch Goal Reward
Contributors of Level 5 and above will receive a FREE Scorpion Lord miniature as a stretch goal reward when the campaign goal of £2000 is reached.  After the Scorpion Lord has been unlocked he may also be purchased as an Add-on by adding £5 to your perk amount.

 

There are a variety of perks to suit every budget, which range in price from £12 to £240 (As well as two Early Bird Specials!).  Each perk allows you to choose from the 7 new sets of miniatures on offer and any of the £8 add-on sets which were released during our previous Indiegogo campaigns.  The miniatures are unpainted and most come with plastic slotta bases.
What scale are these miniatures and what are they made of?
Most of our miniatures are 28-30mm tall, measuring from the base of the foot to the eye.  Because we use a number of different sculptors there may be a degree of variation between sets of figures.  The miniatures are made from a lead-free pewter alloy and are expertly spin cast by Griffin Moulds here in England.
How much is postage?
Postage will be added to your perk during checkout and is based on your location.  Please contact me regarding rates.
When can I expect to get my miniatures?
I am hoping to be able to start mailing out orders by January 2018 if not earlier.  The first two master moulds have already been made as well as several production moulds which should allow me to get the miniatures cast relatively quickly.  If there are any delays I will be sure to let you all know exactly what is going on and how long it might take.
How do I let you know which sets I have chosen for my perk?
You can either send me a message through the Indiegogo site or an email with your selections to mikeburns64@aol.com.  You can do this right away if you know which sets you want, or you can wait until the end of the campaign.
I want to increase my perk level, how do I do this?
Indiegogo does not have an application which enables you to do this yourself.  If you wish to increase your perk level make an additional contribution for the amount which is the difference between the two perks.  For example if you contributed £62 for the level 7 perk and decided you wanted to get the level 8 perk which is £85 you would contribute an additional £23.  You will then need to send me a message about your perk upgrade.
If you have any questions about any aspect of the campaign please send me a message and I will do my best to answer you.
 

PREVIOUSLY RELEASED SETS AVAILABLE AS ADD-ONS:
Level 5 contributors and higher have the option to add-on sets of miniatures to their original pledge at £8 a set (* Unless priced otherwise).  Just add the cost of the add-ons you want to your perk amount.  The details of which add-ons you want will be collected at the end of the project when you send in your perk selections.  You may also choose £8 add-on sets as perk selections if you wish.

A game of intriguing dice, tactical card play, powerful heroes, & unique abilities!Final Live-Stream: 1v1 Manny vs Nate, Barbarian vs Shadow Thief, The Final Showdown!""Dice Throne = King of Tokyo + Anime * Magic the Gathering. Quick Fun!"" -Ed BarafuDice Throne is a fast-paced 2 - 6 player combat game (1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 2v2v2, or free-for-all).Select from a variety of heroes that play & feel completely distinct from one another. Attack opponents and activate abilities by rolling your hero's unique set of 5 dice. Accumulate Combat Points and spend them on cards that have a large range of effects, such as granting permanent hero upgrades, applying status effects, and manipulating dice directly (yours, your teammate's, or even your opponent's).
Highlights:
Unique heroes & abilities that upgrade as the game progresses
5 dice & 32 cards customized for each hero
Dice are king, but can also be tamed
Fast paced & easy to learn
Rich tactics & strategy

Future Plans: We have so many hero concepts bottled up in our minds that we long to bring to life: Frost Mage, Alchemist, Phantom Blade, Necromancer, Bard, Berserker, Druid, and more! We have also begun to map out plans for solo & cooperative play. We hope in the future you can team up with your friends to take on the Mad King himself!The results are in! We were selected to be a part of the PAX South Indie Showcase! The show was incredible for us. Tales of the Aggronaut even said, ""Dice Throne was definitely my tabletop game of the show… but in truth I think probably it was my game of the show as a whole. I highly suggest if you have the opportunity to check this out at any conventions between now and the projected November release date that you grab hold of it with both hands.""       “Dice Throne was definitely my tabletop game of [PAX South]… but in truth I think probably it was my game of the show as a whole.”  -Tales of the Aggronaut 
“It’s really easy to teach and play… the characters are fun and evocative… Absolutely worth checking out!”  -Ed Barafu
 
“It’s very quick to play… really satisfying game… super fun experience!”  -Man vs Meeple
 
“It’s a fast, fun, and gorgeous looking game that I would recommend checking out on kickstarter for sure!”  -Druid City Games
(Note: All reviewers used older prototype versions. We have been improving rapidly!)

Our vision is to create functional, quality, well designed and affordable products to the many players. By backing us on this you will encourage us to keep doing more stuff fo the game and, why not, for another. This is our magnetic dice box for blood bowl players. It is printed on high quality PLA and is designed to hold a complete set of Blood bowl dices. And for last but not at least, it is customizable so you can choose the color of PLA and what you want to inscribed on it.Dimensions are 112 mm length by 50 mms diameter and it come with 4 magnets to keep it closed.   What can I say about our dice cup? Everybody loves it. Its design is inspired on the old blood bowl ball and it is perfect to avoid unpleased hits on your miniatures or dices out of the table. It is very reliable stuff and it will increase your WOW effect. Choose a color to fit your team and see how shocked is your table opponent!Dimensions are 80 mm tall and 70 mm diameter. Do you have a couple of dices that makes you feel unbeatable? Then these helmets will make you feel very happy. They are designed to used with a blood bowl bench. One has ""TURN"" inscribed and the other has ""REROLL"". They can be printed in all colors available or you can paint them if you want them to suit the colors of your team.Dimensions of a helmet: 31x25x23 mm. How many times have moved the score token by accident? This accessory will secure your match score does not have unpleased accidents while you are playing. It comes with a ""0 - 0"" score inscribed in the bottom of the dices gap and you can track scores up to 6 touchdowns. The design is inspired in the original blood bowl ball and you can choose the color of the PLA or paint it to match the uniform of your team.Dimensions: 38x70x20 mm. What you get by backing us is a full set of accessories. You will have one dice box, one dice cup, two helmet dice holder tokens and one score tracker with a price reduction.Also, you will have the chance of customize your dice cup and box for free.This is the pack that you are buying and here you have the color chart available for this project.But we like to go for the extra mille and, for this, we have designed I kind of early bird system where earlier bakers are getting more stuff as higher is our success. Here you have a key chart to understand better what you get. So as fast as you back the more you get. Backers can get gifts that increase the value of what you get up to double of you pay. STRETCH GOAL 1.

We will try to come back to you with a calculation as soon as the campaign ends up. Here you have some estimations to some of the most popular Blood Bowl destinations. Due to some questions from our backers we made a decision. Prices are hard to check so they are linked to the weight. We cannot calculate the weight until the campaign ends up and we know how many things you get for free so we did an estimation based on a currier service (air in case of USA). Nevertheless, we are clear with our customers and we are not about to make profit with transport expenses so we will contact to every backer at the end of the campaign in order to offer several options to chose. If the option chosen is cheaper than the reference price we will refund the difference. Please, do not hesitate to contact us to check your destination cost out. We like to think that we are trusted member of the Fantasy Football Community and I value that trust immensely. We where producing this stuff for nearly half year and we think that it is a good moment to offer it global. We are confidence in our capacity of producing this for you so everything is on our hands, we mean, we produce all items involved in this campaign.We think the point we are trying to make is you can trust in us to deliver this project to you, our reputation depends on it.There is not really much in terms of challenges that haven’t already been overcome. I have the designs completed  and we are using a trusted brand of printers that can produce the quantities we might need.  We aim to ship this project to Backers around JAnuary  2019. Please consider backing this project and spread the word to as many people as you can. If however you choose not to back this project then please feel free to share this project with people you think would like to get involved. This support would be very much appreciated and could make all the difference.Thank you for taking the time to read our pitch, and we hope you choose to help our succeed on this passion project of ours. Should you have any questions please do not hesitate to ask; we'll be ready and waiting to answer them.Cheers!OLD CASTLE CREACIONES CREW",20.0,4,"1 Campaign

fund the production of a brand new range of characterful miniatures, designed especially for collectors, gamers, and painters :)</p><p>the minis are a collection of <strong>Trolls</strong>, <strong>Goblins</strong>, <strong>Gribbles</strong>, and <strong>Orcs</strong>, each cast in high quality <strong>resin</strong>, ranging from <strong>50mm</strong>, to <strong>30mm </strong>scale in size, and each sculpted with a bit of that old school character and charm that first got me into this hobby all those years ago :)</p><p>there will be some individual character minis, and a few small units to start with, and hopefully if it all goes well, we can unlock some more minis to add to the list, and hopefully even add a few gifts thrown in, just to say thanks :) </p><p>also, for a small group of lucky people, there will be the chance to work together to <strong>design</strong> <strong>your</strong> <strong>own</strong> <strong>unique 30mm</strong> <strong>scale</strong> <strong>mini</strong>, sculpted and designed by myself, and cast in high quality <strong>resin</strong>, for use in your own collection, or game, sounds pretty cool, right ?? :D</p><p>I've been a professional miniatures designer for many years, and have finally decided to try releasing my own range, and have enlisted the help of other industry veterans, including <strong>Hysterical</strong> <b>Games</b>,<b> White Dragon Miniatures</b>,<b> </b>and<b> CMA Creative Solutions</b> to help with the 3D printing and physical production. more in depth details about the campaign, production methods, and also a bit about myself and my career, can be seen after all the pretty pictures :)</p><p>thanks for taking a look, I would be very grateful for any support you can give, and if you could share the project online too, that would be awesome too :)</p><p><img class=""lazy""

Premiato con tantissime recensioni entusiastiche, Destino Oscuro 2 ha già dimostrato di saper coinvolgere i Giocatori come non mai: perfetto sia per neofiti che per Narratori e Giocatori più esperti, con Augusta Universalis vivrete ore e ore di avventuroso intrattenimento!Nonostante l'Impero sembri un faro di civiltà, dalla morte dell’Imperatore Eraclio Augusto ogni cosa è andata storta, e la Guerra delle Aquile divide l’unità secolare delle corone imperiali. La ricchissima e potente Bisanzio si è infatti alleata con l’Impero Zarista Sovietico per donare alla propria Basileia, Anastasia Eracliade la Corona suprema. Di contro, la Roma della giovanissima Livia Akiko Augusta, figlia adottata di Eraclio e originaria dell’Impero del Crisantemo, si è unita con Aachen e la tecnoteocrazia del Kaiser Ottone, del Sacro Romano Impero. Il conflitto per il trono Imperiale insanguina i confini fra Europa e Asia con una spregiudicatezza che lascia attoniti tutti gli altri Cesari dell’Impero e i Regni loro federati. Il Centurione Caio Valerio affronta un atterrito capitano delle Guardie Coloniali di Marte. Il Centurione Caio Valerio affronta un atterrito capitano delle Guardie Coloniali di Marte.Su questo sfondo tumultuoso e imprevedibile, si muovono i Pretoriani interpretati dai Giocatori: guardie del corpo elette del Supremo Augusto e dei Cesari che compongono il Senato Imperiale di una Roma che ha conquistato il pianeta Terra e si è espansa nel Sistema Solare e nello Sperone di Orione fino a conquistare lontani e selvaggi esopianeti.  I loro avversari? Indicibili orrori cosmici, specie aliene ostili e minacciose, nemici dell’Impero e folli sette di adoratori dei Troni Oscuri li attendono in fredde aree remote del Cosmo!Cinque fazioni iniziali tra cui scegliere e a cui mettersi al servizio: Roma, Bisanzio, il Sacro Romano Impero, l’Unione degli Imperi Zaristi Sovietici e l’Africa Australis degli Shaka!Cinque Ordini che addestrano i Milites più capaci: i guerrieri dell’Ordo Martis, gli esploratori dell’Ordo Dianae, i diplomatici dell’Ordo Mercurii, i servizi segreti dell’Ordo Plutonis e i filosofi-scienziati dell’Ordo Minervae attendono sempre con trepidazione le nuove reclute!Armati con la loro Tecnolorica, l’esoscheletro potenziato che li rende un anatema di distruzione, e totalmente personalizzabile grazie ai Systemata, i Pretoriani sono pronti a scatenare la furia delle Legioni contro i nemici di Roma! Tanti differenti Ordini di Pretoriani, inoltre, sceglierai tra Tecnoloriche Levis, Medie o Gravis.Con il sistema di Destino Oscuro 2 (già usato ne Le Notti di Nibiru) approfondirai la psiche biomeccanica del tuo Pretoriano nell’eterna lotta fra macchina e carne, affrontando le Missiones più rischiose contro il Grande Regno dei lucertoloidi Sserath, i feroci insettoidi Kyroptidi e le altre misteriose razze aliene della Galassia, nel tentativo di restare umano... nonostante le fiamme della distruzione della Guerra delle Aquile fra Roma e Bisanzio, che spezza per la prima volta l’unità di intenti dello slancio di grandezza dell’Umanità romana.Non solo combattimento: l’ambientazione presenta moltissimi spunti per coinvolgere i Personaggi in indagini oscure e misteriose, o spingerli tra le maglie di intrighi politici velenosi e letali. Quando non sono in Assectum da combattimento, i cibernetici Pretoriani appaiono infatti come super-umani dall’aspetto semi-divino. Augusta Universalis è stato scritto da Marzio Morganti, studioso di storia antica e medievale e appassionato di storia militare, per trasmettere un senso di verosimiglianza e immedesimazione nell’ambientazione quanto più forte possibile.Il gioco mescola elementi storici reali con derive ucroniche e risvolti fantascientifici estremamente suggestivi. Vi ritroverete ad affrontare Missiones di molte nature differenti, e avrete sempre nuovi stimoli per andare avanti!Augusta Universalis si avvale del sistema di Destino Oscuro 2, lo stesso motore de Le Notti di Nibiru!  Un sistema pensato per aiutare il Narratore (qui chiamato Demiurgo) nel suo compito di gestire e vivere meravigliose avventure assieme altri Giocatori, che potranno immedesimarsi con estrema facilità nei rispettivi Personaggi. Il motore di Augusta Universalis è un sistema rapido, che si concentra sulla descrizione delle azioni e delle situazioni sceniche fuori e dentro al combattimento.

Nothing fancy, nothing flashy to get hung up on or go wrong later.You support the campaign and you get a game in return. CORE RULES FEATURES*    Negotiated combat.We use a concept we call Negotiated Combat to determine the dice rolls.Essentially, the players will set the target numbers for attacks, based on the factors you feel should be applied to a given situation.This means that you can be as detailed as you like.This process takes a little to get used to, but once you are in the groove, it lets you play much faster in a game that feels more realistic and responsive to your input.Want to factor in that it’s raining? The smoke from a burning Panzer III? That your men didn’t sleep last night? Go for it.This also makes it phenomenally easy to use any miniatures and vehicles in your collection.As long as you have a basic idea of how a given weapons system or vehicle functions in real life, you can use it on the table.We offer a Matrix-game style “argument” system to help you get started but if this sounds a little too wishy-washy, we also offer pre-baked target numbers where you can just look it up on a table.*    Straight forward command systemBattle is all about friction: No plan ever goes exactly as intended and orders get delayed or mis-understood.Rather than complex systems of order relay and written commands, we use a simple dice system to determine what you can do each turn.You are never stuck being unable to move, but you probably won’t ever get to do everything you need to do either.*    Surprisingly clever damage systemThe rules take a broader view of battle effects.Rather than tracking morale and casualties separately, we take inspiration from the venerable John Hill, creator of Squad Leader, and combine them into a single damage value, assuming that units suffer a loss of confidence as they are subjected to hostile action.This also means that things like suppressing fire before an assault really works and can be resolved far quicker than in many other games.As a consequence of this system, withdrawing troops from the front line and rallying them becomes vital, allowing you to be as aggressive or as cautious as suits your play style.*    Easy to teachIt’s important to us that our games are easy to learn for new players.Inexperienced players tend to get frustrated if they feel like they are struggling against a system they don’t understand. Our core mechanics can be explained in 5 minutes or less, so you can focus on actually solving the tactical challenges on the table, instead of figuring out exactly what to roll for a given situation that just occurred. CONTENT WE INTEND TO PROVIDE*    Two game levels.The game will be playable at two different levels of action.The default will be the Platoon level, where each unit represents a single tank, heavy weapon or infantry section.Players who prefer to think a little bigger will be able to play in Battalion mode, where each unit represents a platoon of vehicles or men. *    Scenario compatibilityIn Platoon level games, the scale matches that of games like Chain of Command, I Ain’t Been Shot Mum, Crossfire and Advanced Squad Leader.In Battalion level games, the scale matches that of games like Command Decision and Spearhead.This allows you to use your pre-built armies, army lists, orders of battle and scenarios, making the transition between rules sets as easy as possible.*    Random army generatorsTables will be provided to roll up a random army with a few quick dice rolls.Leaders rarely get to pick their commands: The true test of battle is to win with what you have available, instead of relying on a hand-picked super army.*    Mission generatorQuickly generate a mission complete with objectives, special circumstances and terrain layout guides.War is chaos and with the generator, no two battles will be exactly alike. *    Lists of equipment and vehicles.We can’t cover every gadget and truck manufactured in the war, but the rules will provide guidelines for a variety of equipment.*    Leader typesDifferent types of commanders to lead your forces. Some may be better at rallying, some may be better at leading the assault and yet some may have unique abilities to help confound your enemies. *    The tool boxLike most Nordic Weasel games, we will include a Tool Box full of rules and suggestions, so you can handle everything from blowing up bridges to interrogating prisoners. This will help enable you to create scenarios as well as resolving unusual situations as they come up.*    Campaign rulesNo game is truly complete without a way to link your games together.Rather than a convoluted system that you’ll never get to finish, we’ll offer systems to play a fun, story-driven campaign game and watch your leaders and troops develop a bit along the way.*    Solo mechanicsWe will include at least basic guidelines for solo gamers. *    Supporting arms Rules will cover all manner of supporting formations, including off-map artillery, air support, partisan activity, command raids and more.*    Introduction sectionsAdditional information introducing players new to world war 2 gaming, discussing basics of land warfare, unit types and a broad overview of tactics. Ideally will also include painting and basic modeling guides.  POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL CONTENT*    Pre Battle SequenceA pre-battle sequence where you can select different fighting styles (such as Extensive Preparations, Frontal Assault, Cunning Deception or Seize Initiative) and dice for unique advantages.*    Weather rules.Whether its fighting in the pouring rain or deep snow, we’d like to make weather rules that are interesting and fun to use, rather than being an annoying chore.*    Army traitsOptional rules to make the armies feel distinct from each other, affecting how they are given orders and what options are available to them on the battle field. Think of these as similar to the “national characteristics” many games have.  CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONSAny project has challenges that must be overcome.For rules writing, the main issues tend to be mechanical (do these systems actually work?

</ul><h3>Why the Tiny Print Run?</h3><p>Since 2012 our crowdfunding approach has been extravagant in every way. Ambitious with massive page counts, plus numerous add-on options and stretch goals. All supporting a primary title itself as many as 990 pages.</p><p>This has resulted in Kickstarter's with memorable pledge rewards that include top-quality hardcover books with sometimes dozens of stretch goal bonuses and add-on extras. These are awesome AND they are expensive to buy for customers like you because they are very expensive to make for publishers like us.</p><h3>Why not use Kickstarter?</h3><p>We will still be using Kickstarter, frequently, for our large-scale projects. These smaller projects are happening in response to the feedback we have heard from both fans and 'almost' fans alike. We hear the request for less expensive options for our projects and products all the time. A second frequent desire expressed to us, whether at conventions, on social media or in email, is for a larger selection of smaller, faster-paced adventures that can be completed in 2-3 sessions and not necessitate a full two year campaign.</p><p>Additionally, Frog God Games has grown in both sales and brand awareness.  This opportunity will give us the additional resources to invest in the very best books in all of our formats. </p><h3>Project Reward </h3><p>With the wishes of the fans in mind, this and future Indiegogo projects will fund standalone projects that are both affordable and fun. This project, as well future Tiny Print Run projects, is narrowly focused with all stretch goals adding resources to the principle reward which traditionally would not be feasible for a publisher our size. </p><h3>Examples of Enhancements from Higher Funding</h3><p>During the 15 day primary project period for <i>Menace in Ravenreach </i> and after the $750 goal is met the focus will be to improve the delivered product. There are no special tiered collectors editions or add-on purchase extras. Thus, as total project funding increases the better the final product will be for everybody.</p><p>Examples of the planned extras that increased funding would bring to <i>Menace in Ravenreach</i>-</p><ul>
<li>Additional commissions for interior color art specific to the adventure</li>
<li>Extra written content commissioned from the author</li>
<li>Printed Player Maps</li>
<li>Downloadable Options designed for popular virtual table-top software (New creature/NPC tokens etc). </li>
<li>Digital extras (player handouts etc) that are focused on quality table-top play.</li>
</ul><h2>Project Delivery</h2><h3>PDF Perks</h3><p>We will email the instructions to all eligible supporters with instructions on accessing PDF items. The PDF files are distributed using Constant Contact service and our web store. You will need to have a customer account on the Frog God Games website to get your PDF; it's how we keep track of everything and grants unlimited access by you to your reward.</p><p>The Indiegogo perk PDF files are 'purchased' at zero cost by supporters (as they are paid for during the Indiegogo promotion) at the Frog God Games web store using a coupon code. That code we will be sent via Constant Contact to the address provided by Indiegogo. Please contact us with any questions/requests about this.</p><h3>Softcover Perks</h3><p>Softcover perks will be mailed to the address provided by us via Indiegogo. </p><h3>Overseas Shipping</h3><p>NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL BACKERS: Shipping international has become very expensive. We understand this. We cannot do anything about this. Likewise, some countries charge VAT tax or other fees to our customers on receipt. We cannot fraudulently lie about the value of materials we mail out. We are happy to ship you anything regardless of where you live, but we have to stay in business at the same time thus even our lightest books are affected. In the near future we expect to have a print on demand system in place for everyone overseas.</p><p>To explain what we mean, please see the shipping calculator for UPS by clicking here- </p><p><a href=""https://wwwapps.ups.com/ctc/request?loc=en_US."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://wwwapps.ups.com/ctc/request?loc=en_US.</a></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p></div>","Menace in RavenreachWhen the group of adventurers arrived in the outpost town of Ravenreach they headed directly to the local tavern.

Why the Tiny Print Run?Since 2012 our crowdfunding approach has been extravagant in every way. Ambitious with massive page counts, plus numerous add-on options and stretch goals. All supporting a primary title itself as many as 990 pages.This has resulted in Kickstarter's with memorable pledge rewards that include top-quality hardcover books with sometimes dozens of stretch goal bonuses and add-on extras. These are awesome AND they are expensive to buy for customers like you because they are very expensive to make for publishers like us.Why not use Kickstarter?We will still be using Kickstarter, frequently, for our large-scale projects. These smaller projects are happening in response to the feedback we have heard from both fans and 'almost' fans alike. We hear the request for less expensive options for our projects and products all the time. A second frequent desire expressed to us, whether at conventions, on social media or in email, is for a larger selection of smaller, faster-paced adventures that can be completed in 2-3 sessions and not necessitate a full two year campaign.Additionally, Frog God Games has grown in both sales and brand awareness.  This opportunity will give us the additional resources to invest in the very best books in all of our formats. Project Reward With the wishes of the fans in mind, this and future Indiegogo projects will fund standalone projects that are both affordable and fun. This project, as well future Tiny Print Run projects, is narrowly focused with all stretch goals adding resources to the principle reward which traditionally would not be feasible for a publisher our size. Examples of Enhancements from Higher FundingDuring the 15 day primary project period for Menace in Ravenreach  and after the $750 goal is met the focus will be to improve the delivered product. There are no special tiered collectors editions or add-on purchase extras. Thus, as total project funding increases the better the final product will be for everybody.Examples of the planned extras that increased funding would bring to Menace in Ravenreach-
Additional commissions for interior color art specific to the adventure
Extra written content commissioned from the author
Printed Player Maps
Downloadable Options designed for popular virtual table-top software (New creature/NPC tokens etc). 
Digital extras (player handouts etc) that are focused on quality table-top play.

We cannot fraudulently lie about the value of materials we mail out. We are happy to ship you anything regardless of where you live, but we have to stay in business at the same time thus even our lightest books are affected.

ABOUT US


Warband-Miniatures is a small project dedicated to create a fantasy miniature range. We want to offer alternative designs of complete bands fully compatible with skirmish games of medieval fantasy.  The Sisters of Serens is the first band that we want to produce, but we are planning to release many more in the future!

Our webpage will be ready a couple of months after the campaign, but you can contact us here: 

info@warband-miniatures.com

 Or in our Facebook page, Twitter page, or even Google Plus


The sculptor of the Sisters of Serens is Sergi Torras Figueras. Sergi has sculpted before for Virgil Games, Willy Miniatures and other miniature brands that have been successful in multiple crowdfundings here on Indiegogo. 

We have also managed to involve Escenorama! Escenorama is a spanish company that sells wonderful scenery, items and bases for medieval and modern wargames.  They will be offering the resin bases included in the Early Bird pledge and as individual perk. 

For the advertising and promotion of the campaign, we have the support of RN Estudio as crowdfunding manager. Surely you know them from other successful crowdfundings and for their amazing miniatures, gorgeously painted. They will also print in 3D the markers and cast them in resin. 

The miniatures will be printed in 3D resin by 3DA and cast in high quality resin by Miniaturas Alemany.

The markers will be printed in 3D and casted in high quality resin by  RN Estudio

<p>'The mechanics of the game can easily be picked up in five minutes or less, and are simple and robust enough that they can be extrapolated upon...the game begins with some tit for tat exchanges until grudges have been thoroughly formed, at which point the ill-fated doctors begin to have gruesome things happen to them.

Amputate, reattach and swap limbs in a desperate bid to stay alive. It's your turn not to turn! 
You're stranded in a hospital during the zombie apocalypse. Will you help or hinder your medical colleagues? Each player chooses a character and tries to keep him or her alive for as long as possible by using special cards. These cards can have a fantastic or gruesome effect on limbs.

The game is designed for 2-4 players (preferably 4), lasts for around 60 minutes and is suitable for ages 15+, due to the comic zombie gore.
It's small enough to fit in your pocket and is suitable to play at parties or if you have a spare hour with friends and family.
The game is easy to learn but the elements of luck and strategy will keep avid board gamers entertained and challenged. 
We are providing FREE SHIPPING on all UK orders as well as low shipping costs for the rest of the World.



 
'The mechanics of the game can easily be picked up in five minutes or less, and are simple and robust enough that they can be extrapolated upon...the game begins with some tit for tat exchanges until grudges have been thoroughly formed, at which point the ill-fated doctors begin to have gruesome things happen to them. It is paced well, and makes for an excellent party game.' - Brendan Cass, d-Infinity

Each card features beautiful character art, a place to store your hit counters, and a summary of the relevant rules. These cards help player keep track of not only their hit banks, but also the actions their character has available to them.</p><h2>The D6 Bank Game System</h2><p>The Afterverse game system is based on pools of 6-sided dice. For most skill tests, you'll add the relevant attribute, such as Agility, to the relevant skill, such as Melee; this determines the size of your dice pool. If the test involves a Specialization and you have that specialization, you'll add two more dice. Situational modifiers may alter this pool further.</p><p>After rolling, any dice that come up as a 5 or 6 count as a hit; if you get enough hits, you've succeeded the test. Sometimes, instead, hits will be banked to be spent over time.</p><p>The initiative system in combat is based on this bank system. You'll roll your character's Reaction plus Perception, and bank your hits into your Initiative Point (IP) bank. Turn order starts with the highest IP bank and proceeds in order to the lowest; as each character acts, they will spend one or more hits from this bank. If the character has enough hits in the bank, they may perform additional actions by doubling the IP cost of the second action. </p><p>But it may be wise to conserve your IP, because this same IP bank is used for dodging. When you are being attacked, you may spend one or more points to set the threshold which the attacker will need for their attack to succeed. This greatly impacts the strategic decisions of the game. Covering fire is invaluable, as you can force the enemy to spend their IP bank dodging your shots instead of shooting back. </p><p>Finally, space combat is built on this same rule set. The Body Class system allows entities which are an order of magnitude larger than others to operate within the same combat at the same time; smaller entities receive a multiplier on their initiative rolls, while larger entities receive a multiplier on damage dealt, allowing a tiny vessel or even an individual person to act in the same combat as a battleship without skipping a beat. </p><p>Often, when in space combat, several characters will all be performing important and unique roles in the fight. The ship's captain makes decisions and controls the deployment of the ship's countermeasures. The pilot may position the ship in different ways in preparation to attack, defend, or evade. The engineer is in charge of repairing systems as they get damaged, managing the ship's waste heat, and supercharging systems which will be required soon. The ship's tactical officers will control the firing of weapons. The ship's crew, each with their own complimentary set of skills, must work together under the leadership of their captain in order to position their ship for attack, supercharge the coilguns, and finally, deal the critical blow against the enemy, drawing upon the banks from every crew position to maximize the damage against their target.</p><h2>The Story</h2><p>My name is Ray Nothnagel. For my entire life, I've been a fan of tabletop games, science fiction, and real-world space travel. I've been working on the Afterverse rule set for the last five years and playtesting it for the last three. I've been designing the Afterverse setting since I was in junior high school - this universe has been kicking around in one form or another for twenty years, and I have the bad spaceship doodles from high school study halls to prove it. The publication of this sourcebook is just one part of the grand scheme for Afterverse. The game system has come a long way since it started as little more than a homebrew variation of Shadowrun. Since that time, it has evolved into a unique game with innovative concepts and lots of refinements. The time spent on the game system has resulted in a robust and fun roleplaying experience where the rules enhance the setting, and don't get in the way of the storytelling.</p><p>This is the second fundraising campaign.

This is how the idea of the dark and decay figurines came up - the Rotten Factory climate. Today, thanks to ""indiegogo"", I decided to share with you my passion and unique artifacts, to give you possibility to fill your collection with something that you have not had so far.</p><p>Today Rotten Factory is not just a passion that intertwines with my daily life. For several months now, it is also a thriving company offering design and production of high quality  figurines for gamers, collectors and painters. Thanks to the campaign, I will be able to further develop, create more products and my models will enjoy not only me but also you!</p><p>Take a look:<br/><a href=""https://rottenfactory.eu/store/index.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://rottenfactory.eu/store/index.php</a><br/><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ROTTEN.FACTORY.MINIATURES"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/ROTTEN.FACTORY.MINIATURES</a></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497032575/fmwi9hmjma6raejzfmbc.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The main goal of the project is to raise funds for the realization of new figures from the new Rotten Factory line. The models, that will arise thanks to your support and will go to your hands, are unique and created specially for this event. They were not previously available for sale, so it can be said that these are fresh, still fragrant with resin models. I will create for you many more of truly exceptional models which, with the development of grants, will appear in the offer.

After 9 years collecting figurines I felt that something in my collection was missing, so I started filling this gap. This is how the idea of the dark and decay figurines came up - the Rotten Factory climate. Today, thanks to ""indiegogo"", I decided to share with you my passion and unique artifacts, to give you possibility to fill your collection with something that you have not had so far.Today Rotten Factory is not just a passion that intertwines with my daily life. For several months now, it is also a thriving company offering design and production of high quality  figurines for gamers, collectors and painters. Thanks to the campaign, I will be able to further develop, create more products and my models will enjoy not only me but also you!Take a look:https://rottenfactory.eu/store/index.phphttps://www.facebook.com/ROTTEN.FACTORY.MINIATURESThe main goal of the project is to raise funds for the realization of new figures from the new Rotten Factory line. The models, that will arise thanks to your support and will go to your hands, are unique and created specially for this event. They were not previously available for sale, so it can be said that these are fresh, still fragrant with resin models. I will create for you many more of truly exceptional models which, with the development of grants, will appear in the offer. So remember if you give more you will get more. ;)Buying Miniatures – How it worksIf you buy a miniature (let's say signed by „A” mark), You will be asked for your choice after the campaign will end. The more people will take part in it the more different figurines will be available at the end of this project.An exception is the Rotten warriors pack set („C”), which contain specific 9 miniatures. Stretch goals – How it worksMiniatures with the red closed padlock on it will be unblocked after the amount of campaign will reach the amount shown on this graphic.C’mon! catch 'em all! ;)What does „ONLY ON INDIEGOGO” mean?It means that these specific miniatures (ones signified by this phrase), are limited only to this project and won't be sold after it. Perks:

<h3>A Little Background</h3>
<p>I'm Kevin Elliott, founder of <i>Collide-O-Scope Edutainment</i>. I originally created <i>Carousel - The Card Game</i> back in 2009 and everyone who played it in its original prototype form loved the game. Life goes on and things happen that take priority over other things. Fast forward through high school, college, a few jobs, and marriage, and <i>Carousel </i>was sitting dusty on the shelf. I have finally dug back into it<i> </i>and I am pleased to present to you the final version of <i>Carousel </i>- smaller, sharper, cleaner, and ready for the world. </p>
<p>Since 2009, finishing <i>Carousel </i>and creating other games have been ever-present in my mind. Creating games, especially those which can be educational and informative, is my passion, and I'd love to share more of my games with you. That starts with <i>Carousel</i>. While I do have other games available through Print-On-Demand means, <i>Carousel</i> is my first attempt at a larger bulk run of games to put into stores and get into more hands.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm asking for help in funding $4,000. This will help me get (at least) 500 sets of Carousel, marketing supplies, access to venues/festivals, and gives just a little room in case of miscellaneous expenses in this endeavor. I'll get the games printed through <i>TheGameCrafter</i>, which means printed in the U.S.A., and at this point, I will be doing the fulfillment of any Perks. If we can't get to $4000, $500 or more will make enough of a dent to get sets printed in a larger quantity. If we raise more than $4,000, that's amazing and <i><strong>SO</strong></i> appreciated, and we'll get even more sets printed and into players' hands.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Successfully funding <i>Carousel - The Card Game</i> would be a game-changer for me, personally and professionally. It would help me to secure a place in the industry of game development as I put copies in stores and get more exposure for my games. My dream, since I was young, has been to make games that have a positive impact, and this campaign could help turn that dream into a reality. </p>

Play Doppelkopf with these beautiful family-friendly cards. Easy to learn – long game fun.</p><p>The Doppelkopf-Game finds more and more enthusiastic fans and supporters, who organize themselves in clubs and even in the German Doppelkopf Association (DDV). Doppelkopf even manages to replace the extremely popular game Skat as the favourite card game of the Germans. Doppelkopf probably originated from the game “Schafkopf”, which already had a set of rules since 1895.</p><p><strong>GAME PRINCIPLES</strong></p><p>Dive into a series of exciting card battles and play togehter in everchanging teams! You must gain valuable Silver Coins by skillfully using your cards. Whoever gains the most, courageously encountering their opponents, wins Golden Coins, the game’s victory points. The first player to earn a predetermined number of Gold Coins wins the game!</p><p><strong>THE TWIST</strong></p><p>The twist of the game is that at the beginning of a new round players do not know their teammate.

<li>The following players must play a card with that family crest if possible. </li>
<li>If you are unable to play such a card there are two scenarios: if the leading crest is from an Earl family (cross, spade, heart), you can trump it with a Royal family card (crown) or discard any other Earl family card if the leading crest is from the Royal family, discard an Earl family card.</li>
<li>The highest Royal card played wins. Otherwise the hightest Earl Card played from the leading family crest. Identical strongest cards: first one played wins. Higher strength same family crest wins.</li>
<li>The players with the Prince/Princess cards play together as a team against the other 2 players.</li>
<li>After 12 Duels everyone adds up their Silver Coins, with team members adding up their Coins collectively.</li>
<li>The team with the most Silver Coins wins. Each member receives 1 Golden Coin. </li>

Wir freuen uns sehr, dass Du unser kleines Projekt unter all den großen Projekten auf Indiegogo gefunden haben. Meine Kinder (13, 10, 4) und ich möchten Dir hier unser kleines Familienprojekt vorstellen. Hier auf Indiegogo setzen wir unsere erfolgreiche Kickstarter-Kampagne vom Mai 2020 fort. Du kann also sofort von 7 erreichten Stretch-Zielen (Erweiterungen) profitieren, die bereits erreicht worden sind. Wir würden uns freuen, wenn Du jetzt einen genaueren Blick auf unser Spiel werfen und uns unterstützen würdest. Ein großes Dankeschön Jörg + Kids  Alle Informationen zum Spiel ab Mitte der Seite auch in Deutsch - bitte nach unten scrollen. <--- Theofilos from Boardgame Stories says: ""If you are in a mood for a casual card game, which is easy to learn and play while being quite tactical, this might be the one for you! There are not many games out there that strictly play in teams, and that’s always a fun aspect. This element lets you bluff, be cutthroat and cooperate, at the same time! That’s the case as you try to find your teammate during the first battles of the game, creating some interesting decisions and situations."" (Read full report) DOUBLEHEAD KIDS is based on the popular german Doppelkopf trick-taking game. Play Doppelkopf with these beautiful family-friendly cards. Easy to learn – long game fun.The Doppelkopf-Game finds more and more enthusiastic fans and supporters, who organize themselves in clubs and even in the German Doppelkopf Association (DDV). Doppelkopf even manages to replace the extremely popular game Skat as the favourite card game of the Germans. Doppelkopf probably originated from the game “Schafkopf”, which already had a set of rules since 1895.GAME PRINCIPLESDive into a series of exciting card battles and play togehter in everchanging teams! You must gain valuable Silver Coins by skillfully using your cards. Whoever gains the most, courageously encountering their opponents, wins Golden Coins, the game’s victory points. The first player to earn a predetermined number of Gold Coins wins the game!THE TWISTThe twist of the game is that at the beginning of a new round players do not know their teammate. Only when the Prince and Princess Cards (“Team”) are laid out bit by bit, the picture becomes clearer and the players recognize in which team they are playing. In Team Prince/Princess (players with Prince and Princess Cards) or in Team Without (players without Prince and Princess Cards). Each round of the game is played differently and in different teams.FOR OUR JAPANESE FRIENDS:ダブルヘッド キッズ(Doublehead Kids)は4人単位(エクスペンションゲームは6人が遊べる)で遊ぶカードゲームです。ダブルヘッドはダブルコップ(Doppelkopf)という家庭ゲームをベースにしたものです。ダブルコップというのは1895年からドイツでよく遊べられたゲームであり、様々な形式があります。現在、SKATというゲームを上回わりドイツで一番人気のあるゲームになりました。ダブルヘッド キッズ は6歳以上の子供達を対象とします。（プレーヤーは1〜20の数字を読める必要性があります。）成功ポイント(ゴール）の設定によってゲームは30〜60分の時間がかかります。ゲームプリンスパル：プレーヤーは決闘カードを置き、2つの交互チームとして遊びます。各プレーヤーは巧みに各自のカードを利用しシルバーコインを獲得します。一番多くのシルバーコインを獲得したプレーヤーは、反対側のプレーヤーの「フォックスfoxesカード」獲得する、または、勇気を持って各自の「カルヒェンKarlchen」カードを利用しゴールデン成功ポイントを獲得します。一番目にあらかじめ設定しておいたゴールデン成功ポイントを獲得したのプレーヤーはゲームの成功者になります。このゲームの特別注目するポイントは、ゲームをスタートした際にプレーヤーは誰が自分のチームメンバーかを知らないことです。At a kickstarter campaign in May 2020, over 200 bakers have already unlocked 7 stretch goals. You profit from this of course and receive it with your order directly. Help us here on Indigogo to take the next step to further enhance the game. Overview game componentsFirst Player / Forehand Tokens - Stretch Goal #5Stretch Goal #6: 350g Linencards Absolutely world class, we did it: all playing cards in the main game and in the new expansion are produced for you in 350g linen quality. The cards are really nice and thick, the linen feels great - they just lie well in the hand. The Doublehead Kids evening will be a celebration. :-) You can choose between three different editions:DOUBLEHEAD KIDS - Normal Edition

 Traditional german Doppelkopf high quality linen card game included in Super Deluxe EditionA dealer package with 20 DOUBLEHEAD KIDS Normal Editions and a package of 5 Super Deluxe Editions as Group Pledge is also available.Doppelkopf has been played in Germany in various forms since 1895 (!) and has meanwhile replaced SKAT as the most popular card game in Germany.Like many 100,000 other Germans, I meet with friends once a month to bang Doppelkopf. At the beginning of 2018 my children (12,9 and 4) asked the question ""We want to play that too..."". We noticed a little frustrated that it is not so easy to explain the rules and cards to children and almost teenagers with a normal Doppelkopf hand.So we came up with the idea ""Hey, why don't create a special deck of cards made for families and beginners to learn the game better without losing all the fun of playing Doppelkopf"". After 7 prototypes and numerous test games, the time came at the end of 2019 and we dared to present our idea on a crowdfunding platform. The first edition of the game was supported by over 300 backers. Since we still get many requests and ideas for the game, we would be happy if you would support our project in the 2nd edition. So maybe even more families can experience the Doppelkopf fun ...
You get a beautiful card game with family-friendly cards 
You learn the favourite card game of the Germans in a simple way 
You will spend many hours of real fun with your dearest family and friends

You will make the hearts of my children (and mine of course) shine 

You support a family project, we are not a big game publisher and we do not make a profit with the game
Carl (Boardgame Stories) shows you how to play the game (english): https://youtu.be/gka7MYK5eRUMarcel (Spiel mal wieder) shows you how to play the game (german): https://youtu.be/iSkEK2GAF1sRules 4 Player Game german Game Rules (pdf) english Game Rules (pdf) japanese Game Rules (pdf)Short overview rules (basic game)
Each player is dealt 12 cards. 
Play 12 Duels. On each Duel player play one card each, in clockwise order. 
The first card played determines the Duel’s leading family crest.
The following players must play a card with that family crest if possible. 
If you are unable to play such a card there are two scenarios: if the leading crest is from an Earl family (cross, spade, heart), you can trump it with a Royal family card (crown) or discard any other Earl family card if the leading crest is from the Royal family, discard an Earl family card.
The highest Royal card played wins. Otherwise the hightest Earl Card played from the leading family crest. Identical strongest cards: first one played wins. Higher strength same family crest wins.
The players with the Prince/Princess cards play together as a team against the other 2 players.
After 12 Duels everyone adds up their Silver Coins, with team members adding up their Coins collectively.
The team with the most Silver Coins wins. Each member receives 1 Golden Coin.

That's true cultural promotion."" (Read more, german) 

 
Andreas says: ""A nice idea to spread a classic game further and to simplify it for the younger target group ... Perhaps also an ideal Christmas present from a Doppelkopf player to his friends, who were deterred by the rules and card sequence ... hope that with this family-friendly design he will win many new players for Doppelkopf"". (Read more, german) Brettspiel-Guru  
Norman from Brettspiele-Magazin says: ""It's absolutely fascinating. I have never before experienced, how one could play a serious round of Doppelkopf after such a short introduction time - especially not with school kids in first grade. Doublehead-Kids really surprised us here all the way."" (Read more, german)   
BRETTSPIEL NEWS - Daniel says: ""If you like Doppelkopf or want to try it out, you should buy Doublehead Kids. In a group of four the game works very well and I understand why it is the most popular card game in Germany today. The access is quite easy, especially with the new cards, which are really well designed and remove the abstract character of the original cards."" (Read more, german)  
BOARDGAMEMONKEYS - Roy says: ""The idea of making Doppelkopf children accessible is absolutely super and laudable. Because in a normal Doppelkopf game it is really very confusing which card is higher ranked and wins the trick and it is even more difficult, in my eyes, to remember how many silver coins (points) the cards bring. Simply printing all this as info on the card is simple and ingenious. ..."".

Ein Händlerpaket mit 20 DOUBLEHEAD KIDS Normal Editionen ist zusätzlich erhältlich.Doppelkopf wird in Deutschland in unterschiedlichen Formen seit 1895 (!) gespielt und hat mittlerweile SKAT als beliebtestes Kartenspiel der Deutschen abgelöst.So wie viele 100.000 andere Deutsche treffe auch ich mich einmal im Monat mit Freunden, um Doppelkopf zu knallen. Anfang 2018 kam bei meinen Kindern (12,9 und 4) die Frage auf ""Wir wollen das auch mal spielen..."". Wir stellten etwas frustriert fest, dass es gar nicht so einfach ist, Kindern und fast Teenagern die Regeln und Karten mit einem normalen Doppelkopfblatt zu erklären.So kamen wir auf die Idee ""Hey lass doch ein spezielles Kartendeck für Familien und Anfänger erstellen, um das Spiel besser lernen zu können, ohne dass der ganze Spielspass von Doppelkopf abhanden kommt"". Nach 7 Prototypen und zahlreichen Testspielen war es Ende 2019 soweit und wir trauten uns, unsere Idee auf Kickstarter zu präsentieren. Die erste Auflage des Spiels unterstüzten über 300 Backer. Da wir immer noch viele Anfragen und Ideen zum Spiel bekommen, würden wir uns freuen, wenn Du unser Projekt in der 2. Auflage unterstützen würdest. So können vielleicht noch mehr Familien den Doppelkopf-Spaß erleben ...
Du bekommst ein wunderschönes Kartenspiel mit familiengerechten Karten

That will allow us to once more be proactive in 2019 and to put more time toward increasing the coolness of RPGnet. We're keeping it simple this year, and focusing on that staff time to improve the web site. This year in particular we figure that we have a wide open playing field for making the site better, thanks to our brand-new forums.$2,500. +1 Staff. We'll guarantee a week of staff time improving the web site in 2019, including some focus on better integrating our new forums with the rest of the site and/or looking into plug-ins that might benefit the site.$5,000. +2 Staff. A second week of staff time, spent on whatever the site needs.$7,500. +3 Staff. A third week of staff time.$10,000. Cage of Security. a fourth and final week of proactive work. This one will be focused on securing the site, primarily by finishing on work to improve the security of our MySQL system.Thank you for your support!",12.0,0,"7 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I just want to start off by letting you know we will ONLY BE SHIPPING TO U.S. ONLY at this time.   </p>
<p>Sorry for any inconvenience.</p>
<p>OK, here's our mission:</p>
<p>The mission of Welcome to Truth is pretty simple: it's to take the knowledge that's in the minds of great Christian Apologists who tour the country (like Ravi Zacharias, Lee Strobel or Frank Turek) and bring it to the average Christian, through different creative means (videos, <strong>card games</strong>, board games, songs, etc.).</p>
<p>We started this journey about 2 1/2 years ago (when we knew nothing about Apologetics), and over time have learned how to defend our Christian faith, and want to pass that on to other Christians throughout the country and world.</p>
</div><div>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The best possible thing that can happen to me in a day is to see someone give their life to the Lord Jesus, walk through that door, and begin following Him.</p>
<p>For some, they may hear a powerful sermon and decide to do this.  However, for many others, they have DEEP and difficult questions that must be addressed for their heart to be open to Jesus. </p>
<p>This is where apologetics comes in, and becomes the key to unlocking the door of their hearts, that they may then walk through.</p>
<p>I understand the POWER of apologetics (learning to defend your Christian faith) because I have seen, firsthand, how it has affected my life and the life of my wife and friends around us.  </p>
<p>This is why I can say, with total humility, that if we, as Christians, learn the evidence in THIS card game, as well as our other card decks, we can truly change this nation, and eventually this world with the good news of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>

<h3><b>Last Year's Board Game was a Great Success</b></h3>
<p>Last year's release of our board game was amazing, as we saw the board game go out all across the country.</p>
<p>The questions from the board game were a bit more difficult, as we were trying to reach an Apologetics-related community. </p>
<p>However, for this new CARD Game's questions, we are trying to reach a broader audience (the average Christian) and so we expect many more people will be impacted by this new offering.</p>
<p>Here are some pictures and reviews from our board game.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
I just want to start off by letting you know we will ONLY BE SHIPPING TO U.S. ONLY at this time.   
Sorry for any inconvenience.
OK, here's our mission:
The mission of Welcome to Truth is pretty simple: it's to take the knowledge that's in the minds of great Christian Apologists who tour the country (like Ravi Zacharias, Lee Strobel or Frank Turek) and bring it to the average Christian, through different creative means (videos, card games, board games, songs, etc.).
We started this journey about 2 1/2 years ago (when we knew nothing about Apologetics), and over time have learned how to defend our Christian faith, and want to pass that on to other Christians throughout the country and world.

What We Need & What You Get
We are trying to raise $10,000 for our campaign.  This will allow us to print up 1,000 card games as well as give us a little bit extra to be able to market the game on Facebook market place, and other targeted marketing strategies.
Here's what YOU get for helping us!

The Impact
The best possible thing that can happen to me in a day is to see someone give their life to the Lord Jesus, walk through that door, and begin following Him.
For some, they may hear a powerful sermon and decide to do this.  However, for many others, they have DEEP and difficult questions that must be addressed for their heart to be open to Jesus. 
This is where apologetics comes in, and becomes the key to unlocking the door of their hearts, that they may then walk through.
I understand the POWER of apologetics (learning to defend your Christian faith) because I have seen, firsthand, how it has affected my life and the life of my wife and friends around us.  
This is why I can say, with total humility, that if we, as Christians, learn the evidence in THIS card game, as well as our other card decks, we can truly change this nation, and eventually this world with the good news of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you are unable to contribute financially to our campaign, you can still help us big time by sharing this campaign with others who may be able to.
Also, your prayers are always appreciated!
What's Included in Card Game
48-Card Card Deck

Cup to Shoot the Bouncy Balls Into

2 Washers to Place at Bottom of Cup to Hold Cup Down

Jewels that Sit On Top of Washers to Help Soften Blow of Bouncy Balls

Bouncy Balls (5 All of Different Colors)

Last Year's Board Game was a Great Success
Last year's release of our board game was amazing, as we saw the board game go out all across the country.
The questions from the board game were a bit more difficult, as we were trying to reach an Apologetics-related community. 
However, for this new CARD Game's questions, we are trying to reach a broader audience (the average Christian) and so we expect many more people will be impacted by this new offering.
Here are some pictures and reviews from our board game.

<p><strong>No Dirty Words</strong></p>

<p>Players usually pick it up after a single hand. The words work together perfectly so that making an insult is easy once you’ve done it once or twice.

</div></div>","Argle Bargle /ärɡəl ˈbärɡəl/ noun - copious but meaningless talk or writing; nonsense.Argle Bargle is a riotously funny, deceptively simple card game where players take turns building ridiculous insults out of words and phrases to humiliate and defeat their friends. The core game is appropriate for ages 14 and up. It is easy to learn and play, and appeals to the party gamer and the tactician alike. Games last 15 to 30 minutes each and can be played with up to 8 players.
Now available on Amazon.com!


Each player is dealt 10 cards and 5 lives. The object of the game is to use your cards to create hilarious insults that remove the ""lives"" from your opponents.
 

Players can choose to use the words on either side of the card, but not both.
 

An insult is four or more words that form a grammatically correct English sentence. Select your opponent and say it like you mean it!
 

But be careful, because there are special cards that can redirect insults.
 

Insults hurt! They take lives away from whomever they land on.
 

Once you lose all your lives, you're out. The last one standing is the winner!
 

 

 

It's @*&%$ funny
It makes people laugh and smile. Often before they’ve even finished their insult! You can check out some of the insults that can be made here on our website: http://www.arglebarglegame.com, or with our Twitter bot at https://twitter.com/ArgleBarglebot - all randomly generated with the words from the game.

We work in cooperation with very talented sculptors, artists and manufacturers to provide you with the best products possible.<br/><br/><b>We want to cooperate with you during the development of our products.</b> The miniatures will be created for you, that's why we want you to be a part of this. So feel free to send us any suggestions and ideas. <b>Your dreams may become reality.</b><br/><br/>With your help we are going to release our first project. <b>Please support us and help us realize our dream!</b><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>

</div><p>As you can see below, the first miniature has already been made, while the rest are in progress or only exist as concepts thus far. We need your help to invest into production molds and materials, so we can create the next miniatures.<br/><br/>We have mentioned before that we would like you to contribute during the development with your ideas. <b>Please send emails (<a href=""mailto:hiddendreamsminiatures@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">hiddendreamsminiatures@gmail.com</a>), make comments here or post on Facebook, telling us any suggestions you may have. </b>To show that your ideas can really make a difference, one goal of that project will be to create a miniature which you, as a group, choose. Another goal is a Sylvan Elves miniature, which we will create entirely based on your ideas. One of you will provide us with the concept, and we'll make the miniature!<br/><br/>For those of you that don't particularly enjoy painting miniatures and view it more as a chore that needs to be done, Hidden Dreams will also paint your miniatures with a colour scheme of your choice and send you the finished models.</p><div> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470723889/gotowe2_wynik_e4znv4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>At the bottom of the site there is a list showing the current status of the miniatures and that status will be updated over time. But do not be afraid to back something which is still locked at the moment. When the stretch goal is reach you will receive your new miniature. And if we cannot reach the stretch goal in question, then you will be able to choose other miniatures, or we will just give you a refund.<br/><br/>One last thing: the delivery times are an approximation. Everything should be delivered in time, but some things could be delayed, while others could be faster. The delivery times are flexible at this point and will be changed based on the demand for specific miniatures.<p> </p>

</div></div>","Welcome!
We would like to invite you to support our first crowdfunding campaign dedicated to Sylvan Elves miniatures. All of them are compatible with Fantasy Battles: The 9th Age. We are a small and very new company, but with your support we want to provide a new line of fantasy miniatures. We work in cooperation with very talented sculptors, artists and manufacturers to provide you with the best products possible.We want to cooperate with you during the development of our products. The miniatures will be created for you, that's why we want you to be a part of this. So feel free to send us any suggestions and ideas. Your dreams may become reality.With your help we are going to release our first project. Please support us and help us realize our dream! 
 

As you can see below, the first miniature has already been made, while the rest are in progress or only exist as concepts thus far. We need your help to invest into production molds and materials, so we can create the next miniatures.We have mentioned before that we would like you to contribute during the development with your ideas. Please send emails (hiddendreamsminiatures@gmail.com), make comments here or post on Facebook, telling us any suggestions you may have. To show that your ideas can really make a difference, one goal of that project will be to create a miniature which you, as a group, choose. Another goal is a Sylvan Elves miniature, which we will create entirely based on your ideas. One of you will provide us with the concept, and we'll make the miniature!For those of you that don't particularly enjoy painting miniatures and view it more as a chore that needs to be done, Hidden Dreams will also paint your miniatures with a colour scheme of your choice and send you the finished models. 
 At the bottom of the site there is a list showing the current status of the miniatures and that status will be updated over time. But do not be afraid to back something which is still locked at the moment. When the stretch goal is reach you will receive your new miniature. And if we cannot reach the stretch goal in question, then you will be able to choose other miniatures, or we will just give you a refund.One last thing: the delivery times are an approximation. Everything should be delivered in time, but some things could be delayed, while others could be faster. The delivery times are flexible at this point and will be changed based on the demand for specific miniatures. 


 
 So if you like the look of the miniatures below, please support us, so we can create them for you. If you know someone who might be interest, tell him/her about this crowdfunding campaign. Visit and like our Facebook page and please spread the word wherever you can.And last but not least we would like to thank everyone who supports our company. We would also like to thank the crew of The 9th Age, and everyone who is involved in the development of that great project. See you all on battlefield! 1. Shapeshifter Forest Prince

We hear the request for less expensive options for our projects and products all the time.

Casey is prolific and would be willing to do this, Frog God Games can speak on his behalf. We would, however have to pay him for this :)</p><p>Printed Player map(s)/Insert.

We understand this. Likewise, some countries charge VAT tax or other fees to our customers on receipt. We cannot fraudulently lie about the value of materials we mail out. We are happy to ship you anything regardless of where you live, but we have to stay in business at the same time thus even our lightest books are affected.<strong> In the near future we expect to have a print on demand system in place for everyone overseas</strong>, It is not ideal, as the final book is not printed at the highest-quality when compared to the ones we fulfill in Indiegogo.</p><p>To explain what we mean, please see the shipping calculator for UPS by clicking here- </p><p><a href=""https://wwwapps.ups.com/ctc/request?loc=en_US"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://wwwapps.ups.com/ctc/request?loc=en_US</a>.</p><p> </p></div>","Encephalon Gorgers on the MoonThe Forest of Night has always been a strange place.

A second frequent desire expressed to us, whether at conventions, on social media or in email, is for a larger selection of smaller, faster-paced adventures that can be completed in 2-3 sessions and not necessitate a full two year campaign.Additionally, Frog God Games has grown in both sales and brand awareness.  This opportunity will give us the additional resources to invest in the very best books in all of our formats. Project Reward With the wishes of the fans in mind, this and future Indiegogo projects will fund standalone projects that are both affordable and fun. This project, as well future Tiny Print Run projects, is narrowly focused with all stretch goals adding resources to the principle reward which traditionally would not be feasible for a publisher our size. Examples of Enhancements from Higher FundingDuring the 15 day primary project period for Encephalon Gorgers on the Moon and after the $1000 goal is met the focus will be to improve the delivered product. There are no special tiered collectors editions or add-on purchase extras. Thus, as total project funding increases the better the final product will be for everybody.Examples of the planned extras that increased funding would bring to  Encephalon Gorgers on the Moon-Additional commissions for interior color art specific to the adventure. Example: The previous Indiegogo project, Menace in Ravenreach, added 2 interior art pieces and 3 extra creature illustrations for its appendix.Extra written content commissioned from the author. Casey is prolific and would be willing to do this, Frog God Games can speak on his behalf. We would, however have to pay him for this :)Printed Player map(s)/Insert. This is one we would love to do but it would require a substantial increase in overall project funding.Downloadable Options designed for popular virtual table-top software (The rewards for both How Orcus Stole Chrismas! and In Vino Giigantus included the new creature/NPC tokens and player maps). Digital extras (player handouts etc) that are focused on quality table-top play.Help with the digital assets to enhance the module for the Fantasy Grounds marketplace. This has been done for all three previous releases from Indiegogo by Michael Potter.Project DeliveryPDF PerksWe will email the instructions to all eligible supporters with instructions on accessing PDF items. The PDF files are distributed using Constant Contact service and our web store. You will need to have a customer account on the Frog God Games website to get your PDF; it's how we keep track of everything and grants unlimited access by you to your reward.The Indiegogo perk PDF files are 'purchased' at zero cost by supporters (as they are paid for during the Indiegogo promotion) at the Frog God Games web store using a coupon code. That code we will be sent via Constant Contact to the address provided by Indiegogo. Please contact us with any questions/requests about this.Softcover PerksSoftcover perks will be mailed to the address provided by us via Indiegogo. Overseas ShippingNOTE TO INTERNATIONAL BACKERS: Shipping international has become very expensive. We understand this. Likewise, some countries charge VAT tax or other fees to our customers on receipt. We cannot fraudulently lie about the value of materials we mail out. We are happy to ship you anything regardless of where you live, but we have to stay in business at the same time thus even our lightest books are affected. In the near future we expect to have a print on demand system in place for everyone overseas, It is not ideal, as the final book is not printed at the highest-quality when compared to the ones we fulfill in Indiegogo.To explain what we mean, please see the shipping calculator for UPS by clicking here- https://wwwapps.ups.com/ctc/request?loc=en_US.",2.0,0,"21 Campaigns

It was a great way to give back, <strong>I've always believed maths should be fun and that children should be enjoying it.</strong> It felt wrong that children had to suffer from low confidence in maths and I thought volunteering would be a noble thing to do, Why not? I jumped in. The schools selected a few kids with low maths confidence and the program started. Within a few weeks, I got some very surprising and rewarding feedback; a report from the teachers said that all the children had started being more engaged in maths classes and had increased in confidence. Wow! It made me want to do more. </p><p>By the end of the year-long program, <strong>we got reports that the children’s maths levels had gone up more than they ordinarily would have if they didn't have the extra support.</strong> It was such an amazing feeling, that a normal girl like me could even contribute to helping in such a meaningful way; with something that was such a big problem in schools, with both parents and children. This was really changing lives, not only theirs, but my life too. This had sowed a seed in me that was to change my life. </p><p>I had always loved maths and I had purposely chosen more maths-like units at University in my Computing degree which finally resulted in a 1st Class Honours result. Then I started working in Investment Banking while studying for my MSc in Financial Markets, just so I could engage with more maths-like things; but all the while I kept thinking of how I could make a difference in children's lives in the home, with their parents support. This was mainly because in each school, there were only a few children the school could assign to be helped in a year. Because we weren't that many, we couldn't help every single child in the school. I wanted to extend this to the home and support parents to find an easy way to help their children and be empowered to do so.</p><p>The problem though, I quickly realised was bigger than that. </p><p><strong>Three key problems were surrounding children learning maths and their maths skills. Many children:</strong></p><ul>
<li>Hate Maths, don't see the point in doing it, or find it a boring chore. </li>
<li>Don't believe they can become good at it. (Usually because they've been inadvertently told that by a parent or a teacher).</li>
<li>Do not have effective, creative, fun methods of doing maths.</li>
</ul><p>Sadly, many children experience low self-esteem and low self-confidence as a result, which can affect their school experience and future.</p><p>The bigger problem is that many parents are afraid of maths themselves and don't know how to help their children. </p><p>The world is changing and is a lot more demanding now. The youths of this current generation are already finding it harder to get good jobs and without maths, this challenge is only increased.</p><p>In 2012, UK government statistics first showed that half the adults in the UK have numeracy levels no greater than that of an 11-year old, which is said to be costing our economy £20 billion a year.  The problem is not getting better. There are similar problems in the USA, Canada, Australia and many more countries.</p><p>These are the problems I set out to change. I had the idea to create a 4-step solution and methodology that would include a fun maths board game for children aged 6 - 13 years possessing excellent play value (replay-ability), so that children would be wanting to play over and over again, not just once or twice. I wanted to create a game that would keep them coming back and at the same time make them think creatively and develop their critical thinking skills.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477054954/a5yvz38nu9f8nuiwkijo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>A maths game that would also be different by allowing children with stronger and weaker maths abilities to play together and learn in a stress-free, relaxed environment, be it at school or at home. One that parents too would enjoy playing as most parents I spoke to said they didn't enjoy the children maths games they had. They said the games they had were simply ""maths"" and nothing more. </p><p>When I was pregnant with my first child and on maternity leave, I created my first prototype and started working on my idea. I became busy, being a mum raising my boy and girl in between and kept struggling to be able to come up with ways to get the replay-ability factor in the game for many years.  Eventually I had to start all over again in 2013 when I realised that game just wasn't working. A very lovely mentor I met through Virgin Startup advised me to create a brand new game but use the same mechanics I had used for the first. I did not know how to draw and kept trying different things (some horrible, some hilarious) until I managed to draw something that has now been refined a thousand times.

I want every parent to experience the magic of playing the right maths games with their child. My children have also each played this game with me over 150 times. My daughter has been playing this particular game since the age of 4 years and it has reflected tremendously in her results and particularly timetables. It resulted in zero stress in mastering her multiplication timestables in record time.Please join our Supporters. Back this maths board game project, and together, let's help children build the important skills they need to thrive in this modern world.I want to make a difference to the society and impact children globally. I could not go to bed without helping children fall in love with numbers – it’s my addiction.",5.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>‘See You in Whistler’ Ski Resort Jigsaw Puzzle &amp; Community Fundraiser</h3>
<p>My name is Lorne Craig. Like many powderhounds, I was wiped out when the 2020 ski season was cancelled due to Covid-19. But then I thought of all the resort workers and locals who would be hit even harder. So I decided to make something to keep me occupied until the runs open again, and raise money for Whistler Community Services at the same time.</p>

<p>Thousands of years ago, a galactic war erupted between the mighty terrestrial civilization of Vareene and an invading alien force over a powerful technological secret that would grant its wielder dominion over the galaxy: the Catalyst. For all their valor and skill, the Vareene were vanquished, most of their people and planetary holdings wiped away in a terrible apocalypse, and the rest fighting a losing battle. To ensure their survival, the last bastion of the Vareene chose a remote, primitive planet named Ceres and sent their survivors there.</p>
<p>With their vastly superior technology and advanced learning, the Vareene refugees quickly rose as leaders among the native population. Many of the technological wonders they brought were initially intended as a means of striking back against the invaders who had destroyed their empire. On Ceres, they built several star-gates so they might one day travel across the galaxy as part of a coordinated strike.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1544126085/qzztrrjclkhv5esxgfug.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Unfortunately, such would never come to pass. Now called the Congregation, the alien invaders combed over the ashes of the Vareene throneworld, searching for clues as to where they might have secreted the Catalyst. A handful of survivors managed to retreat through a star-gate to Ceres, where they warned the fledgling colony of the threat. Afraid that they would find the hidden planet, the last of the Vareene decided, in a desperate move, to activate a powerful cloaking device that would shroud the planet in an energy barrier, hiding it from Congregation probes but also preventing the use of the star-gates. Thus Ceres became a haven, but also a prison. </p>
<p>Isolated for thousands of years, the Vareene slowly forgot their origin. The technological devices they brought became magical artifacts, the useless star-gates abandoned ruins, the force field became known as the “Barrier.” The truth was forgotten, or else evolved over the generations into a kind of religion. The Catalyst that the Vareene came from the stars to hide and protect has become an object of veneration, but no one can say precisely what it does or how it might be awakened once more.</p>
<p>A few millennia later, the survivors still rule the countries of Ceres, only partly understanding the cataclysm that looms in their future. The force field is losing power and will soon disappear, revealing the planet once more. Over so many centuries, the Congregation has consolidated its power over the galaxy, where it deals with pesky rulers of rebel worlds, galactic traders and smugglers, technological geniuses and preachers of alien gods, all of whom will stand no match against the awesome power of the Catalyst…</p>

<p>In Seeds of Wars, characters will spend most of their time ruling their <strong>Realm</strong> in a political and economical simulation game. </p>
<p>Each player will control one of the five different types of Realm: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Order</strong> - You are the ruler of a kingdom and you will try to expand your influence through diplomacy and war. </li>
<li>
<strong>Faith</strong> - You are the spiritual leader of a widespread religion and you will try to spread the influence of your god through propaganda and proselytizing. </li>
<li>
<strong>Trade</strong> - you are the owner of a successful trading network and you will try to increase your wealth through espionage and bargaining. </li>
<li>
<strong>Magic</strong> - you have mastered the forces of Nature and you will try to use its energy to alter reality and cast spells affecting vast territories. </li>
<li>
<strong>Culture</strong> – you are one of the great artists of your time and you will try to promote your Art and contribute to the cultural heritage of your contemporaries. </li>

<p>Resources are also measured on a different scale. By collecting taxes and fees, Rulers will increase the <strong>wealth</strong> of their Realm.

Every action undertaken by the ruler will cost wealth and/or influence.</p>
<p>Geographically, the world of Ceres is divided into <strong>Kingdoms</strong> and each Kingdom is divided into <strong>Counties</strong>. There are many actions to choose from. Some of them will only affect a county while others will affect an entire Kingdom.</p>

<p>Because yes, there will be <strong>battles</strong>. Every ruler will be able to muster an army and use strategic and tactical warfare, gather military intelligence, move troops across the land and occupy the enemy’s lands.</p>

<h3><strong>About the Adventure</strong></h3>
<p>In the tradition of classic adventure scenarios such as <i>The Keep on the Borderlands</i> and <i>The Village of Hommlet</i>, <i>The Sinister Stone of Sakkara</i> features a detailed starting base and small wilderness sandbox in addition to a dungeon. </p>
<ul>
<li>The adventure scenario is approximately 50,000 words.

<h3>About the Setting</h3>
<p>The Auran Empire setting was inspired by the collapsing empires of earth’s Late Antiquity (250 – 750 AD), a turbulent era in which ancient glories were drowned in a torrent of violence. However, in the Auran Empire setting, the horror of civilization’s imminent collapse is worsened by the existence of nightmarish evils lurking in the world’s dark places, threatening to strike mankind at its weakest moment. The established leadership is too preoccupied by the empire’s political and military downfall to take these shadowy threats seriously, leaving them to be handled by adventurers, fortune-hunters, and would-be heroes. The adventurers’ success in dealing with such threats is, however, what garners them the fame, wealth, and strength they need to take power and restore order. Of course, the adventurers are not certain to win; indeed, the odds are stacked against them.  </p>
<p>These premises of the Auran Empire setting are evident throughout <i>The Sinister Stone of Sakkara</i>, most notably in its backstory. The adventure begins with local hamlets and villages suffering from humanoid raids because the troops that ought to be protecting them have been sent to stem an invasion at another border. With the local military barely able to garrison its strongholds, it falls to the adventurers to deal with the monstrous threat. If they do not, no one else will, until it is too late. The setting premises are also evident in the design of the dungeon itself. The upper level of the dungeon was inspired by real-world ancient architecture, and the brigands and beastly barbarians that populate it would not be unfamiliar to any Late Roman centurion (albeit the barbarians who menaced Rome were only <i>figuratively</i> beastly). Conversely, the lower level of the dungeon is a warren of weird horror wherein lurks an insidious evil that is far more threatening than mere humanoids. The dungeon thus represents the Auran Empire setting in microcosm – visibly endangered by mundane threats, appallingly imperiled by hidden horrors. </p>
<p>Of course, if you don't want to use the Auran Empire setting, the adventure can be placed into any down-on-its-luck empire with some ancient and evil opposition!</p>

About the Adventure
In the tradition of classic adventure scenarios such as The Keep on the Borderlands and The Village of Hommlet, The Sinister Stone of Sakkara features a detailed starting base and small wilderness sandbox in addition to a dungeon. 

The adventure scenario is approximately 50,000 words. That's 10,000 words more than the adventure's old school version.  The Sinister Stone of Sakkara has been re-written from the ground up to follow the XP, Challenge Rating, and Treasure guidelines for 5E. 

The adventure features dozens of black and white illustrations by Michael Syrigos and a pair of full-color landscape paintings, one of the fortress of Türos Tem and one of the buried temple by concept artist Jeff Brown.
The starting base includes a villa, headquarters, hospital, chapterhouse, infantry barracks, cavalry barracks, bathhouse, traveler's inn, and forum, all mapped and keyed.
The dungeon features two levels, the first with 75 rooms and the second with 39 rooms, mapped and keyed, along with two custom random encounter tables. 
The adventure is set in our Auran Empire campaign world, a swords & sorcery setting inspired by the Late Roman Empire. For the first time, we offer Fifth Edition stats for many monsters of the Auran Empire, including the Abominable Young Dragon, Abomination, Birthing Tree, Brigand, Possessed Giant Spider, and Zaharan Ruinguard, plus 5E stats for Imperial Cataphracts, Legionaries, Legates, and more.

We are a micro start up team of two: Mark Miller and Robert van der Dussen, and we have produced everything you see here in just two years, all the while holding down day jobs.We are both software engineers, and we are both passionate gamers. But one day we noticed there might be more to life than computers, and we decided to build Table Top Games.The inspiration for the game can be found in a book Mark wrote, Winter – The Vracken’s Gate. “Dwarf War” is one of the chapter titles, and he thought to himself when he wrote it, “That would make a great game.” We have one specific goal in our design philosophy:

What was it the man said? “Make no small plans!”. 


 
Dwarf War is a fast, action-packed strategy, 3D table-top game for 1 to 4 players. The Game board is built as you play from stackable caverns, connected by attachable Tunnels.The Play Pieces are held on to the Cavern Positions by magnets, giving the game play a robust and satisfying feel.There are two rule sets that can be used with the Dwarf War Games System, a Battle game for 2-4 Players or the Solo/Coop Game for 1-2 Players.There is a basic game mechanic used in both Rule Set, and is demonstrated on our tutorial site.  There, you can find details of how the game-play proceeds in the Battle Game.  The Battle Rules allow Players to fight it out in different scenarios of underground warfare. The Rules are deterministic and resource based, but the number of possibilities to consider will keep you guessing.The Starter Set has 12 Caverns and  allows two Players to Battle.The Expansion Set adds 9 generally larger Caverns and 2 more Players.The 1-2 Player Solo/Coop game Dwarf War – Retake the Outlands sets the Player of Players against the Bosses and Monsters of the Game Engine. Battle your way through the caverns reclaiming cave by cave the Outlands of the once great Dwarven Nation.Here is a PDF to a description of the opening moves of the Solo/Coop Game.Dwarf War is a 3D Table-Top game. The players combat each other while exploring a network of caverns that can be connected to one another: up, down, or all around. The underground of the mountain is built with stackable Caverns that each have a number of mounting positions for the different pieces in the game. The Dwarf War Game Board is made up of Stackable Caverns. These are the Caverns in the Starter Game Set.The Mounting positions in each of the Caverns are magnetic.

And there's no better form to show that than illustrations!</p>
<p>The goal is simple. Fund art for transport and vehicles of <strong>Tikor</strong>.</p>

<h3>What is Swordsfall?</h3>
<p>In the beginning... <strong>Tikor</strong> is a world where deities and spirits are as real as the nature that surrounds us. Since the earliest writings of mankind, the gods have been there alongside humanity. They are a vital part of the makeup of human societies across the globe. In a way, this is to be expected. Humans were in fact created by the gods. Various great deities created cultures of their design and ethos. As time marched forward, these various cultures and groups co-existed. Sometimes contentiously, sometimes harmoniously, but always striving to co-exist. </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1569944777/krzqu4jh1nqgzhk8nis3.png"" src=""""/><br/><i>Ishvana Creates Tikor by Tumo Mere</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>History, however, would change its course in a single tragic day and the horrific night that followed. <strong>Mime</strong>, the Garuda deity of Wisdom, is assassinated at the hands of an alleged Vinyatian assassin. Mortal hands had never before slain a deity. As tensions between the rival nations of <strong>Garuda </strong>and <strong>Vinyata</strong> soared under a long Tikor night, a bloody battle erupted between the two sides. A truce was called once the truth of the news surrounding the assassination was called into question, but not before irreversible damage to both sides was done. </p>
<p>Despite the armistice between bitter enemies, the wounds of that day will forever linger. The world heaves as the one constant, the gods themselves, waver. A new struggle begins…</p>

<h3>It's The Year 10 A.R</h3>
<p>As the world still recovers, ten years after the bloody events that ended the Era, its fallout begins to appear. Rumors around the world tell of the arrival of a new kind of weapon. Instruments capable of killing gods,<strong> Grim Arms</strong>. Could this be related to the unsolved assassination of <strong>Mime</strong>? </p>
<p>In <strong>Garuda</strong>, a power struggle is in full effect as the current ruler of <strong>The Divine Order of the Phoenix</strong>, <strong>Amma Zencora</strong>, vies to hold onto his ill-gotten throne. How far will the ruler go to defend the throne he so desperately wants to keep? </p>
<p><strong>Vinyata </strong>is adjusting to a world with one less major city and cultural hub. <strong>The Eastern Node</strong> was destroyed during the bloody war at the <strong>End of the Era</strong>. An unpleasant surprise emerges as the survivors rebuild and a rash of malevolent spirits now roam the region. The souls of those lost 10 years ago are still attached to the mortal plane, hungry for vengeance and retribution. </p>

<p><strong>Hawklore's</strong> neutrality during <strong>The Longest Night</strong> has finally paid dividends. The God King, <strong>Hawken</strong>, basks in the increasing wealth of his nation. On the outside, it seems like a rich paradise where any want can be attained. Yet below the surface, in the dingy streets of the capital city of <strong>High Perch</strong>, dissent stirs.</p>
<p>Rumors abound that the desolate stretch of land known as the <strong>Ebon Cascade</strong> has become home to a new form of horror. Something cunning that is uniting the monstrous beings that inhabit the region. Whispers say a Raksha is on <strong>Tikor</strong>, hiding away and building an army. None want to believe the horrifying rumor, and none dare to confirm it.</p>
<p>In the boundless waters of <strong>The Grand Divide</strong>, new forces arise as the largest pirate fleet of them all, Heaven's Fall, begins to marshal. With the cold genius of <strong>Nubia </strong>leading them, her power has begun to make those on land to take notice. The law of the sea changes as rumors of an alliance between her and the tech genius, <strong>Kent Musa</strong> begin to circulate. </p>

Do not try to eat dice, children, because they're not edible and could harm you. These are resin dice and not candy.</strong></u></h3><p>Greetings, dice fans! Steve Jackson Games is no stranger to custom dice, having produced several different dice sets over the last few years. Our <strong><i>Kitten d6 Dice Set</i></strong>, <strong><i>Army Men d6 Dice Set</i></strong>, and <i><strong>Robot d6 Dice Set</strong></i> are only a handful of the designs you can find at <a href=""http://www.warehouse23.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Warehouse 23</a> and now, with your support, we're bringing an entirely new set of 19mm six-siders to your game table!</p><p>The <i><strong>Candy Heart d6 Dice Set</strong></i> is a pack of three different resin dice . . . and this time we're bringing you in on the ground floor of the project! Unlike the majority of our earlier dice sets, this crowdfunding campaign is your chance to be a part of the process all of the way from ""we have an idea!"" to "" the dice have landed!"" </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1602623339/fiw8dmci0boyp2ejidak.png"" src=""""/></p><p>The above image is a digital mockup of the planned 19mm resin dice designs. The set includes three different dice. Exact colors, corner radius, and details may vary, depending on the factory's technical capabilities. Unlike the other dice we have produced, this campaign shows you the steps we take as we design a new pack of dice.</p><h3>It All Starts With An Idea</h3><p>First step: Send notes to the production team so that they have a rough starting point for the dice designs. The below text is what was provided to our production department:</p><p><i>""Inspired by the classic Valentine's Day candy. Colors are pastels.<br/><br/>Resin dice set of three 19mm dice. Hearts instead of pips on the two through six sides. The ones side has text:<br/><br/>1x LOVE<br/>1x HUGS<br/>1x XOXO""</i></p><p>Then the team prepares a flat image showing the six faces of each of the dice. Ideas are knocked around until the production department has something they're happy with that meets the project's core concept.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1602624187/vblkzkbhytzqxuloviyj.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The above image shows the three dice designs as well as the color selections. The exact dice details are subject to change during the manufacturing process, but we will do all that we can to get as close to these designs as possible. Once this crowdfunding campaign has closed, then the factory will create the molds needed to produce the three different resin dice. The moldmaking process could result in slight adjustments to the size, positioning, and spacing of the design elements.</p><h3>Next It Is The Factory's Turn</h3><p>After submitting the designs, the factory reviews everything and provides us with a pricing estimate and rough schedule. Since these are resin dice, we're using a different supplier than we use for many of our dice . . . but have no fear! We know from experience that Longpack, our resin dice factory for this project, can create what we're looking for because they have already produced several dice for us. The <strong><i>Gelatinous</i></strong> dice game and our 19mm <i><strong>Munchkin Rainbow Dice</strong></i> were both handled by Longpack.</p><h3>And This Is Where You Come In</h3><p>Rather than take our usual next steps, we've turned to you, the dice collectors, to share in the process before we move to the manufacturing stage. If there's enough interest in the concept, then just as soon as this Indiegogo campaign comes to a close we will pull the trigger on the order. We will post photos as they come in so that you can watch updates as these dice go from our team's design drawings to the real world.</p><p>Join us, gang, and let's make these dice happen in time for Valentine's Day 2021!</p><p><u><strong>NOTE: These are resin dice and not candy. Do not try to eat dice, children, because they're not edible and could harm you.

Do not try to eat dice, children, because they're not edible and could harm you. These are resin dice and not candy.Greetings, dice fans! Steve Jackson Games is no stranger to custom dice, having produced several different dice sets over the last few years. Our Kitten d6 Dice Set, Army Men d6 Dice Set, and Robot d6 Dice Set are only a handful of the designs you can find at Warehouse 23 and now, with your support, we're bringing an entirely new set of 19mm six-siders to your game table!The Candy Heart d6 Dice Set is a pack of three different resin dice . . . and this time we're bringing you in on the ground floor of the project! Unlike the majority of our earlier dice sets, this crowdfunding campaign is your chance to be a part of the process all of the way from ""we have an idea!"" to "" the dice have landed!"" The above image is a digital mockup of the planned 19mm resin dice designs. The set includes three different dice. Exact colors, corner radius, and details may vary, depending on the factory's technical capabilities. Unlike the other dice we have produced, this campaign shows you the steps we take as we design a new pack of dice.It All Starts With An IdeaFirst step: Send notes to the production team so that they have a rough starting point for the dice designs. The below text is what was provided to our production department:""Inspired by the classic Valentine's Day candy. Colors are pastels.Resin dice set of three 19mm dice. Hearts instead of pips on the two through six sides. The ones side has text:1x LOVE1x HUGS1x XOXO""Then the team prepares a flat image showing the six faces of each of the dice. Ideas are knocked around until the production department has something they're happy with that meets the project's core concept.The above image shows the three dice designs as well as the color selections. The exact dice details are subject to change during the manufacturing process, but we will do all that we can to get as close to these designs as possible. Once this crowdfunding campaign has closed, then the factory will create the molds needed to produce the three different resin dice. The moldmaking process could result in slight adjustments to the size, positioning, and spacing of the design elements.Next It Is The Factory's TurnAfter submitting the designs, the factory reviews everything and provides us with a pricing estimate and rough schedule. Since these are resin dice, we're using a different supplier than we use for many of our dice . . . but have no fear! We know from experience that Longpack, our resin dice factory for this project, can create what we're looking for because they have already produced several dice for us. The Gelatinous dice game and our 19mm Munchkin Rainbow Dice were both handled by Longpack.And This Is Where You Come InRather than take our usual next steps, we've turned to you, the dice collectors, to share in the process before we move to the manufacturing stage. If there's enough interest in the concept, then just as soon as this Indiegogo campaign comes to a close we will pull the trigger on the order. We will post photos as they come in so that you can watch updates as these dice go from our team's design drawings to the real world.Join us, gang, and let's make these dice happen in time for Valentine's Day 2021!NOTE: These are resin dice and not candy. Do not try to eat dice, children, because they're not edible and could harm you.

<p>The <i>Pair O' Dice Role-Playing Game</i> is designed to be played with only a standard set of dice -- two six-sided dice. No pouch of various polyhedrons needed here. Just swipe a pair of good ol' fashion dice out of one of the board games tucked away in the linen closet. And while the dice required are minimum, the game itself is not limited. The<i> POD RPG</i> utilizes variations of familiar mechanics of old school role-playing games, while at the same time minimizing a lot of the crunch that can sometimes get in the way of playing a good story.</p>
<p>The <i>Pair O' Dice Role-Playing Game</i> is not a ""story telling"" game. It's a bonafide role-playing game with all of the elements that players like: character attributes, skill checks, combat, and of course... dice rolling. There may be more ""realistic"" role-playing game systems out there, but is that why you really play role-playing games? The <i>POD RPG </i>system takes a more cinematic approach for more thrills and chills -- which is why you play role-playing games in the first place. Right?</p>
<p>The <i>Pair O' Dice Role-Playing Game</i> is ideal for the one-off spur of the moment game (because someone in the group didn't show up or the game master is unprepared) or even an ongoing campaign that doesn't rely on the trappings of cumbersome rules and components.</p>

<p>And, like any good role-playing game crowdfunding campaign worth your pledge, there are stretch goals. The <i>Pair O' Dice Role-Playing Game</i> is more than just one guide book.

Each stretch goal will unlock a new supplement (or POD) that goes into further detail on how the <i>POD RPG</i> can be utilized for specific genres of games such as fantasy, sci-fi, super hero, horror, you name it. These supplements will have more specific elements based on and constructed using the <i>POD RPG</i> system. For example the <i>Fantasy POD</i> will contain character archetypes, skills, weapons, spells, artifacts, creatures, and lore pertaining to the classic fantasy role-playing game setting.

<h3>What are some details about the <i>Pair O' Dice Role-Playing Game System</i>?</h3>
<p>The information provided below should serve as a sample of the very basics of the <i>Pair O' Dice Role-Playing Game</i> system and does not represent the entire scope of the game.</p>
<p>The overall resolution mechanic utilized with the<i> Pair O’ Dice</i> system is two six-sided dice—or 2d6. Resolution rolls are modified by a simple progression ladder of penalty and bonus modifiers. These modifiers are stackable, but are limited. Both character attributes and skills use the same 2 thru 12 ranking system. The modifiers generally rank from ""Worst"" (-3) to ""Best (+3).</p>
<p>Most characters, player and non-player alike, as well as creatures, have six attributes. They are Muscle, Moves, Might, Mind, Moxie, and Mojo, or the six Ms. Each attribute is ranked or scored between 2 and 12—with 7 being the most common.</p>
<p>Grit (or grit points) is what keeps a character alive—a combination of physical and mental endurance, coping and enduring with damage and pain, and a will to live to fight another day.</p>
<p>Checks to determine success or failure are rolled using 2d6. (Just like about everything else in the game.) The method for skill checks is called “SAM.” S.A.M. = Skill + Attribute + Means.</p>
<p>The X-Factor represents abilities that are above and beyond “normal” capabilities. They may be manifested by a number of different means, such as alien, divine, mechanical, magic, mutation, special circumstances or conditions, etc… The X-Factor increased the chance of success and the end result.</p>
<p>Again, the examples above do not represent the <i>Pair O' Dice Role-Playing Game</i> system as a whole, and is offered here to provide an idea of what it is all about.</p>
<h3>Why create another role-playing game system?</h3>
<p>The goal with the <i>Pair o’ Dice Role-Playing Game</i> is to devise a fun and enjoyable method to enjoy role-playing with a variety of different and creative settings and genres. In order to cook up a role-playing system that would be simple to learn, yet flexible enough to manage a wide variety of settings familiar role-playing game standards were borrowed and modified and a lot of excess was shaved off. In the <i>Pair O’ Dice</i> universe(s), certain laws of science, nature, and reality needed to be simplified and/or modified in order to achieve the goal of creating a simple role-playing game system that captured a cinematic feel.</p>
<p>So, things work the way they do in the <i>Pair O’ Dice Role-Playing Game</i> for a reason. It’s understood that the system here might not be ideal for every RPGer, and that’s why there are already hundreds of other different role-playing systems out there. If there’s a rule that you don’t like in the <i>POD RPG</i> system, then by all means break it and make it work the way you want. After all, rules were made to be broken. The rules, as they are, are rather sparse and straight forward for ease of play. A concentrated effort has been made not to expand or overthink the rules too much.</p>
<p>The <i>Pair O’ Dice Role-Playing Game</i> is the sort of game that you can play on the fly if your regular gaming session falls through by someone not showing up. Or, as a break from your mega-long epic campaign—just to mix things up. It’s a simple system that can be played during your lunch break at school or work, in a blanket fort with your kids, or in the backseat of a car during a long road trip.</p>
<p>The<i> Pair O' Dice Role-Playing Game</i> can also be used for extended campaigns and/or adventures when it is desirable for the rules to take a backseat to the overall story and fun.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491258646/rpu9yzn0zt8mpnohb1s2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>The <i>Pair O' Dice Role Playing Game Guide Book</i> is on track to be completed before the July ETA. The September ETA for additional unlocked stretch goal supplements is for the first few products with the additional products following in a timely manner of a few months. There is no set timeline for the additional ""Lifelong Pod People Pledge"" products, but they are anticipated to be released on at least a monthly schedule by the end of the 2017 calendar year.</p>
<p>The risk of successfully producing the final product is minimized by the fact that only digital rewards are being offered. There is no physical production of printed material to delay delivery. GeekPunk has run successful crowdfunding campaigns under the name ""Dan Taylor"" for various comic books such as <i>Hero Happy Hour: On The Rocks</i>, <i>Hero Happy Hour Vs. The Supreme Leader</i>, and<i> Donald of the Dead</i>.</p>
<p>GeekPunk's first RPG crowdfunding campaign <i>Crosswell: Junction to Adventure</i> was successful as well. While delays were experienced in production of the final product, lessons were learned to help assure that future campaigns run more efficiently.</p>

If there’s a rule that you don’t like in the POD RPG system, then by all means break it and make it work the way you want. After all, rules were made to be broken. The rules, as they are, are rather sparse and straight forward for ease of play. A concentrated effort has been made not to expand or overthink the rules too much.
The Pair O’ Dice Role-Playing Game is the sort of game that you can play on the fly if your regular gaming session falls through by someone not showing up. Or, as a break from your mega-long epic campaign—just to mix things up. It’s a simple system that can be played during your lunch break at school or work, in a blanket fort with your kids, or in the backseat of a car during a long road trip.
The Pair O' Dice Role-Playing Game can also be used for extended campaigns and/or adventures when it is desirable for the rules to take a backseat to the overall story and fun.

Risks and Challenges
The Pair O' Dice Role Playing Game Guide Book is on track to be completed before the July ETA. The September ETA for additional unlocked stretch goal supplements is for the first few products with the additional products following in a timely manner of a few months. There is no set timeline for the additional ""Lifelong Pod People Pledge"" products, but they are anticipated to be released on at least a monthly schedule by the end of the 2017 calendar year.
The risk of successfully producing the final product is minimized by the fact that only digital rewards are being offered. There is no physical production of printed material to delay delivery. GeekPunk has run successful crowdfunding campaigns under the name ""Dan Taylor"" for various comic books such as Hero Happy Hour: On The Rocks, Hero Happy Hour Vs. The Supreme Leader, and Donald of the Dead.
GeekPunk's first RPG crowdfunding campaign Crosswell: Junction to Adventure was successful as well. While delays were experienced in production of the final product, lessons were learned to help assure that future campaigns run more efficiently.",5.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>Freebooter Miniatures presents: Limited 10 Year Anniversary Set – <strong>Freebooter's Fate ""Legends"" Character Set</strong><br/></strong></h3>

<p><strong><strong><img alt=""Perks"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://data.freebooterminiatures.de/Indiegogo/Text_Company.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Perks""/></strong></strong></p>
<p>Freebooter Miniatures is a German company producing mostly 30mm size metal miniatures for gamers, collectors and painters. The company is owned and run by Werner Klocke who has been a freelance sculptor for more than 18 years. His credits include sculpts for such well-known companies as Games Workshop, Reaper and Pivateer Press, among others. He has become particularly known for his love of dynamic poses and his skill at capturing the female form. Two years ago, Freebooter Miniatures successfully launched its own game, Freebooter’s Fate, a card-based, pirate-themed, diceless, tabletop skirmish game, which has had people going “Arrr!” all over the world since then and has already had two expansion sets published for it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><strong><strong><img alt=""Perks"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://data.freebooterminiatures.de/Indiegogo/Text_Project.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Perks""/></strong></strong></strong></p>
<p>This year, Freebooter Miniatures celebrates its first 10 years in business. So what better way for a miniatures company to celebrate an event like that than to issue a set of limited edition special anniversary miniatures? Exactly.</p>
<p>So the idea was born to design a set of characters which were special: Legends of our game world, given the outstanding and finely-detailed physical form which our customers have come to expect from us.</p>
<p>Doing it via crowdfunding gives us the opportunity to add a few extra options which would not have been feasible in the classic business model and it gives you the opportunity to decide exactly how deeply to become involved.</p>
<p>Sounds interesting? It gets better. Read on.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><strong><strong><img alt=""Perks"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://data.freebooterminiatures.de/Indiegogo/Text_Good_Stuff.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Perks""/></strong></strong></strong></p>
<p>So what can you expect to receive when forking out your hard-earned doubloons? Well, at the basic level, the project is about a set of five miniatures, depicting legendary characters from the world of Freebooter’s Fate. They have all left their mark in different ways and, in addition to unique abilities for each individual, they all use a new rules mechanic, called the Fate Point System.</p>
<p>And here they are:</p>
<p><strong><img alt=""Raven Queen"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://data.freebooterminiatures.de/Indiegogo/FML01.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Raven Queen""/></strong></p>
<p>Raven, aka Mistress of Shadows – an Imperial Noble, clandestine supporter of the Brotherhood and practitioner of a very dark and shadowy form of mysticism.</p>
<p><strong><img alt=""Cerebro"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://data.freebooterminiatures.de/Indiegogo/Cerebro_green.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Cerebro""/></strong></p>
<p>Maestro Cerebro &amp; Birro – a mad goblin inventor of things that go Boom! and his long-suffering assistant who fusses over him like an old hen.</p>
<p>El Almirante – a heroic young man who in his declining years will become Gobernador of Longfall.</p>
<p>Captain Antoinette Balfour – an excellent sailor but a rotten leader, grubby, rum-sodden and not especially bright.</p>
<p>Ixchelcoatl – a legendary high priestess of the Amazons.<br/><strong> <br/></strong></p>

<p>Of course, once you go beyond the basic level, and the more people get involved, the more advanced the options get. The beauty of crowdfunding projects is that you can go for the safe option of a basic pledge (our “Pirate” level) which gets you a guaranteed set of stuff, provided the project reaches its minimum funding level.</p>
<p>In our case, this minimum level sits at USD 5,000.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can invest a bit more money (with a “Captain” level) and reap the benefits when more people become involved and the project really takes off. Once certain funding levels are reached (see below), the return for your initial pledge grows, even though you don’t you have pay any additional money.</p>
<p>These benefits can include additional parts or substitute parts for the characters, such as better weapons, sidekick characters or other miscellaneous stuff. Most of these add-ons are accompanied by character or equipment cards which take our already impressive Legends to even greater levels of power. Neat, huh?</p>
<p>Not all extra goals give you automatic bonuses, though, some release additional pledging/update options. These can be available for all pledge levels or just for specific ones, please see below for details.</p>

<p>So what happens once the campaign is over? Well, these miniatures are intended as a once-off special on the occasion of our 10 year anniversary. And once that is over, they will no longer be available from us. In fact, most of these sets will only be available as part of this Indiegogo campaign. The best way to secure your miniature(s) is to pledge the amount for what you’d like, spread the word among your mates so they get in on it as well and the project reaches not only its minimum funding level but also some stretch goals. Once this campaign is over, we cannot guarantee that we will have any models left over. They will at most be available until the end of our anniversary year. So, even if we have some unpledged ones left over, we will only sell them until October 2013. At a higher price. Only while stocks last. And that will be it. At Freebooter Miniatures, limited production run really does mean limited production run.</p>

<p>Some of you appear to have been so dazzled by the shiny metally goodness on offer that they completely overlooked the fact that we have a game in which the Legendary Characters can be used. So we made an extra perk to provide an entry point for those of you who would like to see their Legend stride through a world of rum, doubloons and salty seadogs in a fast, fun and entirely card-based tabletop skirmish game. With peg legs. For more information on the game of Freebooter’s Fate, see </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.freebooters-fate.de/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.freebooters-fate.de//index.html</a>.</p>
<p>With this perk, you will receive the Freebooter's Fate Rulebook (German or English), a set of Freebooter’s Fate playing cards, a starter set for the crew of your choice, and one Legendary Character from the Deckhand level perk. This set will not benefit from any stretch goals reached during the campaign; you will only receive the basic miniature.</p>
<p>NB: It is important that you tell us in the comments section</p>
<p>- in which language you would like your rulebook (German or English)</p>
<p>- which crew you would like (it should be noted that while it is not absolutely necessary, the separate purchase of the “Deep Jungle” expansion book when choosing Amazons as your crew would be beneficial for all parties concerned)</p>
<p>- which specific Legendary character you would like.</p>
<p>! Please <strong>add US$ 10</strong> when pledging for the<strong> Goblin Pirates</strong> in this perk, because their starter set contains <strong>6</strong> instead of the usual 4 miniatures. !</p>
<p>Should you have already made a pledge which overlaps with this one and would like to upgrade, simply pledge the difference without claiming a perk and let us know in the comments field (or via email at crowdfunding_AT_freebooterminiatures.de) from where to where you would like to upgrade.</p>
<p>A brief note for those of you thinking of Christmas or who are just plain impatient. This perk will be sent out in two parts: shipping of the limited edition miniature will commence in March 2013 as advertised, but the rules, cards and starter box will be shipped in November. (Free of charge worldwide, of course.) That’s right, in time for Christmas for most countries.</p>

<p>We at Freebooter Miniatures love us some shiny metally goodness. So we looked at our new Legend miniatures and thought about whether there was any way of making them even shinier and, um, more metally. And we have found one. The result is this version of the Freebooter goblin captain in silver for the serious collector. Yes, not just silver-plated, one step up from ordinary sterling silver (925), this miniature is made of solid fine silver (935).</p>
<p>These miniatures have individual sequential numbers engraved on them so you can be sure to own a unique copy. We are offering the first 10 of these here on Indiegogo. In future, we may release additional ones, e.g. as trophies for tournaments, on special occasions, maybe even in different materials or finishes, but your only real chance of obtaining one of the single-digit ones is here on Indiegogo.</p>

<p><strong>A Freebooter's Fate miniature designed by you!</strong><em><strong><br/></strong></em></p>
<p>Here's the deal in detail: You tell us what kind of miniature you would like, provided it is humanoid in shape, roughly human-sized and fits one of the Freebooter's Fate crews. We will provide concept sketches with your likeness or the likeness desired by you. The character will become part of a crew in the next Freebooter's Fate expansion book to be published next year, so we will write some rules for it as well. This means that we will also be giving it a name based on your own or based on your suggestions. Please keep in mind that the character will have to fit into the world of Freebooter's Fate, please don't ask for male Amazons, for example.</p>
<p>In addition to your place in gaming history, you will also receive the orignal green of the character. Of course, the production rights, copyright of the sculpt and any commercial licence in any way, shape or form shall remain with Freebooter Miniatures. So you're not allowed to make copies of it. You won't have to, mind, because we will also be supplying you with 10 metal casts of your miniature, which should be enough to be getting on with for all sorts of gaming-related purposes.<em><strong><br/></strong></em></p>

<h3><strong><strong>Chassa, a new mercenary </strong>will be added as a new option to the perk level “Deckhand”!</strong></h3>
<p>Our confidence has been boosted to such an extent by all the support which people have shown us that we have decided to throw in another stretch goal out of schedule. Chassa is, well, you know, when people want to have a quiet word with somebody? Somebody who might not necessarily want to have any word whatsoever with them, quit or otherwise? That’s when they call people like Chassa. Yeah, that’s right, she’s a bounty-hunter. Since she is excusively motivated by money, she is quite happy to sign up as a mercenary with a crew fighting against her mark anyway, thus getting effectively paid twice.</p>
<p>Like the Pirate level set, Chassa will be available from regular retail outlets (you know, FLGSs, our own online store etc.) after this campaign has finished. She will have a limited production time of one year until the end of October 2013. RRP will be US$ 18.</p>

<h3><strong><strong>Papa Houngan </strong>will be added as a new option to the perk level “Deckhand”!</strong></h3>
<p>Papa Houngan shows what happens when you actually start to enjoy being possessed by loas. Since he is unable to invoke them himself, he is forced to roam the countryside constantly on the lookout for a mystic to attach himself to and revel in the feeling of another being controlling his thoughts and actions. Without a spiritual rider, Papa Houngan is reduced to shuffling around like a coffee addict before their first cup of the day.</p>
<p>Like the Pirate level set, Papa Houngan will be available from regular retail outlets (you know, FLGSs, our own online store etc.) after this campaign has finished. He will have a limited production time of one year until the end of October 2013. RRP will be US$ 18.</p>

<p>Ich hoffe, Ihr habt ebenso viel Spaß mit dem Freebooter’s Fate Legend set und unserem Spiel Freebooter’s Fate, wie ich ihn haben werde, sie zu modellieren und zu designen. Und ich freue bereits jetzt auf die nächsten 10 Jahre!</p>

<p><strong>FAQ summary: </strong></p>
<p>It seems that the FAQ section is hidden quite well, so here is the top list of questions we have been asked:</p>
<p><strong>Do I need a credit card for that? Can I pay with credit card?</strong></p>
<p>Indiegogo uses Paypal AND credit card for contributions, and, in Germany at least, you do not need a credit card for Paypal use, a current bank account is sufficient.</p>
<p><strong>Can I upgrade my contribution at a later stage?</strong></p>
<p>Sure, if you can`t resist the temptation as more and more groovy extra bits get revealed, you can contribute the difference to what you want to have now, put a corresponding note in the comments box. Please note that downgrading your contribution is not possible.</p>
<p><strong>Can I make multiple contributions for the same level?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely, go right ahead. This could be necessary if you want to have all ten Legends (needing one Captain and four Deckhand perks in total).</p>
<p><strong>Can I get a single miniature of the Pirate set, but with all the bonus options?</strong></p>
<p>No, sorry. In order to be able to offer the sets on Indiegogo at the prices we do, we have to group certain options together. Only the Captain perk and Captain-related ones guarantee you these updates. Deckhand perks for Virgo Despiedad, Papa Houngan and Chassa can possibly benefit from stretch goals.</p>
<p><strong>Can I get Calamite Balfour in any other form than in the Captain perk?</strong></p>
<p>No, sorry. Calamite is the “Indiegogo Captain Perk”-exclusive. She is the only model of this campaign that will ONLY be available at Indiegogo and ONLY for Captain or Captain based perks.</p>
<p><strong>How do I have to contribute for a limited perk?</strong></p>
<p>In order to contribute for a limited perk you MUST claim that perk. It is NOT possible to just make a contribution and tell us, that you want to have a limited perk. We need the counter for the limitation to go up, so that everyone can see how much limited sets are left and thus we won't fullfill any limited perk orders we received via comments only.</p>
<p><strong>Can I add regular orders from the Freebooter shop to my Indiegogo contribution to gain free shipping on that order?<br/></strong></p>
<p>Yes, of course you can. Just tell us in the comments section of the Freebooter Miniatures Online Shop, that you have contributed and want to have the contribution and the regular order shipped all in one. But please note, that we ship the Inidegogo goods in March 2013, so any additional orders from our shop will also be shipped in March 2013 if you link them to the Indiegogo contribution. </p>
<p>In case you don't want to wait and need some stuff from our store earlier, please have a look at our shipping conditions:</p>
<p>Germany: 2,50 EURO Shipping, Free Shipping on orders of 60,-+ EURO</p>
<p>Europe: 4,50 EURO Shipping, Free Shipping on orders of 120,-+ EURO</p>
<p>World: 6,00 EURO Shipping, Free Shipping on orders of 180,-+ EURO</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p></div>","Freebooter Miniatures presents: Limited 10 Year Anniversary Set – Freebooter's Fate ""Legends"" Character Set
   Diesen Text gibt es in der Gallery als Kampagnenbeschreibung auch auf Deutsch.
(Rechtsklick auf den Link und dann ""Ziel speichern unter"" auswählen).

Freebooter Miniatures is a German company producing mostly 30mm size metal miniatures for gamers, collectors and painters. The company is owned and run by Werner Klocke who has been a freelance sculptor for more than 18 years. His credits include sculpts for such well-known companies as Games Workshop, Reaper and Pivateer Press, among others. He has become particularly known for his love of dynamic poses and his skill at capturing the female form. Two years ago, Freebooter Miniatures successfully launched its own game, Freebooter’s Fate, a card-based, pirate-themed, diceless, tabletop skirmish game, which has had people going “Arrr!” all over the world since then and has already had two expansion sets published for it.
 

This year, Freebooter Miniatures celebrates its first 10 years in business. So what better way for a miniatures company to celebrate an event like that than to issue a set of limited edition special anniversary miniatures? Exactly.
So the idea was born to design a set of characters which were special: Legends of our game world, given the outstanding and finely-detailed physical form which our customers have come to expect from us.
Doing it via crowdfunding gives us the opportunity to add a few extra options which would not have been feasible in the classic business model and it gives you the opportunity to decide exactly how deeply to become involved.
Sounds interesting? It gets better. Read on.
 

So what can you expect to receive when forking out your hard-earned doubloons? Well, at the basic level, the project is about a set of five miniatures, depicting legendary characters from the world of Freebooter’s Fate. They have all left their mark in different ways and, in addition to unique abilities for each individual, they all use a new rules mechanic, called the Fate Point System.
And here they are:

Raven, aka Mistress of Shadows – an Imperial Noble, clandestine supporter of the Brotherhood and practitioner of a very dark and shadowy form of mysticism.

Maestro Cerebro & Birro – a mad goblin inventor of things that go Boom! and his long-suffering assistant who fusses over him like an old hen.
El Almirante – a heroic young man who in his declining years will become Gobernador of Longfall.
Captain Antoinette Balfour – an excellent sailor but a rotten leader, grubby, rum-sodden and not especially bright.
Ixchelcoatl – a legendary high priestess of the Amazons. 

 
 
 

Of course, once you go beyond the basic level, and the more people get involved, the more advanced the options get. The beauty of crowdfunding projects is that you can go for the safe option of a basic pledge (our “Pirate” level) which gets you a guaranteed set of stuff, provided the project reaches its minimum funding level.
In our case, this minimum level sits at USD 5,000.
Alternatively, you can invest a bit more money (with a “Captain” level) and reap the benefits when more people become involved and the project really takes off. Once certain funding levels are reached (see below), the return for your initial pledge grows, even though you don’t you have pay any additional money.
These benefits can include additional parts or substitute parts for the characters, such as better weapons, sidekick characters or other miscellaneous stuff. Most of these add-ons are accompanied by character or equipment cards which take our already impressive Legends to even greater levels of power. Neat, huh?
Not all extra goals give you automatic bonuses, though, some release additional pledging/update options. These can be available for all pledge levels or just for specific ones, please see below for details.
 
 

So what happens once the campaign is over? Well, these miniatures are intended as a once-off special on the occasion of our 10 year anniversary. And once that is over, they will no longer be available from us. In fact, most of these sets will only be available as part of this Indiegogo campaign. The best way to secure your miniature(s) is to pledge the amount for what you’d like, spread the word among your mates so they get in on it as well and the project reaches not only its minimum funding level but also some stretch goals. Once this campaign is over, we cannot guarantee that we will have any models left over. They will at most be available until the end of our anniversary year. So, even if we have some unpledged ones left over, we will only sell them until October 2013. At a higher price. Only while stocks last. And that will be it. At Freebooter Miniatures, limited production run really does mean limited production run.
 

Please note that while shipping is free of charge, the items will be shipped from Germany and may thus be liable to customs duties outside the European Union.
 

The following applies to all perks,:
All miniatures are sculpted by Werner Klocke.
All sets are securely shipped in padded envelopes, there is no box.
All miniatures are made from metal. They will be supplied as unassembled, unbased kits, except where explicitly stated otherwise. They are all supplied with the standard Freebooter's Fate plastic bases with metal inserts.
The miniatures and all additional parts are 30mm size like all the other Freebooter’s Fate miniatures.
Each character comes with all the cards necessary to make it usable in Freebooter’s Fate, in German and in English.
Each set comes with a certificate of authenticity.
Shipping commences in March 2013.
All sets are shipped free of charge! Yes, that’s worldwide. Postage to anywhere in the world is on us.
Please also note that you do not necessarily need a credit card to participate in an Indiegogo campaign (see FAQ for setails).
Right, here are the perk levels and the stuff you can receive depending on the total funding level reached.
 

 

Deckhand level perk US$ 16

Please tell us the exact name of the character in Step 5 Comments section of your contribution. Some characters are excluded from this perk level (see picture above for who is available and who isn’t). Please note that characters at this level do not benefit from any stretch goals which might be reached.

It will have a limited production time of one year until the end of October 2013. RRP will be approx. $ 80.

NEW:  Codex Level Perk US$ 90
Some of you appear to have been so dazzled by the shiny metally goodness on offer that they completely overlooked the fact that we have a game in which the Legendary Characters can be used. So we made an extra perk to provide an entry point for those of you who would like to see their Legend stride through a world of rum, doubloons and salty seadogs in a fast, fun and entirely card-based tabletop skirmish game. With peg legs. For more information on the game of Freebooter’s Fate, see 
http://www.freebooters-fate.de//index.html.
With this perk, you will receive the Freebooter's Fate Rulebook (German or English), a set of Freebooter’s Fate playing cards, a starter set for the crew of your choice, and one Legendary Character from the Deckhand level perk. This set will not benefit from any stretch goals reached during the campaign; you will only receive the basic miniature.
NB: It is important that you tell us in the comments section
- in which language you would like your rulebook (German or English)
- which crew you would like (it should be noted that while it is not absolutely necessary, the separate purchase of the “Deep Jungle” expansion book when choosing Amazons as your crew would be beneficial for all parties concerned)
- which specific Legendary character you would like.
! Please add US$ 10 when pledging for the Goblin Pirates in this perk, because their starter set contains 6 instead of the usual 4 miniatures. !
Should you have already made a pledge which overlaps with this one and would like to upgrade, simply pledge the difference without claiming a perk and let us know in the comments field (or via email at crowdfunding_AT_freebooterminiatures.de) from where to where you would like to upgrade.
A brief note for those of you thinking of Christmas or who are just plain impatient. This perk will be sent out in two parts: shipping of the limited edition miniature will commence in March 2013 as advertised, but the rules, cards and starter box will be shipped in November. (Free of charge worldwide, of course.) That’s right, in time for Christmas for most countries.

NEW:  Long John Silver Level Perk US$ 250
We at Freebooter Miniatures love us some shiny metally goodness. So we looked at our new Legend miniatures and thought about whether there was any way of making them even shinier and, um, more metally. And we have found one. The result is this version of the Freebooter goblin captain in silver for the serious collector. Yes, not just silver-plated, one step up from ordinary sterling silver (925), this miniature is made of solid fine silver (935).
These miniatures have individual sequential numbers engraved on them so you can be sure to own a unique copy. We are offering the first 10 of these here on Indiegogo. In future, we may release additional ones, e.g. as trophies for tournaments, on special occasions, maybe even in different materials or finishes, but your only real chance of obtaining one of the single-digit ones is here on Indiegogo.

Jennifer has also kindly agreed to paint not just the basic version of the character but, where applicable, the one including all the stretchgoals achieved at campaign end which directly affect the character (i.e. excluding sidekick characters on separate bases).
Of course you will choose, which parts will be used to assemble the miniature and thus be painted!

A Freebooter's Fate miniature designed by you!
Here's the deal in detail: You tell us what kind of miniature you would like, provided it is humanoid in shape, roughly human-sized and fits one of the Freebooter's Fate crews. We will provide concept sketches with your likeness or the likeness desired by you. The character will become part of a crew in the next Freebooter's Fate expansion book to be published next year, so we will write some rules for it as well. This means that we will also be giving it a name based on your own or based on your suggestions. Please keep in mind that the character will have to fit into the world of Freebooter's Fate, please don't ask for male Amazons, for example.
In addition to your place in gaming history, you will also receive the orignal green of the character. Of course, the production rights, copyright of the sculpt and any commercial licence in any way, shape or form shall remain with Freebooter Miniatures. So you're not allowed to make copies of it. You won't have to, mind, because we will also be supplying you with 10 metal casts of your miniature, which should be enough to be getting on with for all sorts of gaming-related purposes.
This perk level will only be available here at Indiegogo!

A pirate who can also fight for the Cult, and you think she will hand her pistol to just any old monkey for reloading? No, no, no. You have to do these things with style.

Bonus Stretchgoal
We have been so overwhelmed with the success of this campaign that we have decided to include a spontaneous bonus to the Captain level. Yes, it wasn’t announced, you didn’t know it was coming, it just so happens that we are nice people who appreciate their loyal fans and customers. So here you go:
The Raven Queen’s ethereal Shadow will be added for free to perk levels “Captain”, “Commodore”, “Treasure Hunter” & ""Gobernador""! 
The Shadow is an additional character on its own base and with its own character card. Only available here on Indiegogo!

Bonus surprise Stretchgoal!
Chassa, a new mercenary will be added as a new option to the perk level “Deckhand”!
Our confidence has been boosted to such an extent by all the support which people have shown us that we have decided to throw in another stretch goal out of schedule. Chassa is, well, you know, when people want to have a quiet word with somebody? Somebody who might not necessarily want to have any word whatsoever with them, quit or otherwise? That’s when they call people like Chassa. Yeah, that’s right, she’s a bounty-hunter. Since she is excusively motivated by money, she is quite happy to sign up as a mercenary with a crew fighting against her mark anyway, thus getting effectively paid twice.
Like the Pirate level set, Chassa will be available from regular retail outlets (you know, FLGSs, our own online store etc.) after this campaign has finished. She will have a limited production time of one year until the end of October 2013. RRP will be US$ 18.
Free shipping worldwide!

 

Double Time! At 50.000 USD we will give you TWO new stretch goals instead of one:
FIRST:
""Tufo"", Calamite's assistant, will be added for free to perk levels “Captain”, “Commodore”, “Treasure Hunter” & ""Gobernador""! 
Tufo is an additional character on its own base and with its own character card. As you can see, this puppet like thing is unliving in some sort and needs to be controlled by Calamite.  Only available here on Indiegogo!

SECOND:
Papa Houngan will be added as a new option to the perk level “Deckhand”!
Papa Houngan shows what happens when you actually start to enjoy being possessed by loas. Since he is unable to invoke them himself, he is forced to roam the countryside constantly on the lookout for a mystic to attach himself to and revel in the feeling of another being controlling his thoughts and actions. Without a spiritual rider, Papa Houngan is reduced to shuffling around like a coffee addict before their first cup of the day.
Like the Pirate level set, Papa Houngan will be available from regular retail outlets (you know, FLGSs, our own online store etc.) after this campaign has finished. He will have a limited production time of one year until the end of October 2013. RRP will be US$ 18.
Free shipping worldwide!

 
 

The ""Legendary Upgrade"" pack will be added for free to all Mercenario Captain Virgo Despiedad “Deckhand” perk levels!

The RRP for him will be approx. US$ 20.
 

 

The second Additional bit Upgrade pack will be added for free to perk levels “Captain”, “Commodore”, “Treasure Hunter” & ""Gobernador""! 
All six characters will each get an extra bit to enhance their look and fighting ability. This upgrade will include equipment cards where appropriate. Only available here on Indiegogo!

The RRP for him will be approx. US$ 20.
 

 

Cererbro's mini canon will be added for free to perk levels “Captain”, “Commodore”, “Treasure Hunter” & ""Gobernador""! 
This upgrade will include equipment cards where appropriate. Only available here on Indiegogo!

 
 

The ""Legendary Upgrade"" pack will be added for free to all Chassa “Deckhand” perk levels! 
This upgrade pack includes an alternate head and two arms holding a netgun.
The RRP for her will be approx. US$ 20.
 


Special bonus stretch goal:
""Pelado"" the powder monkey of El Almirante will be added for free to perk levels “Captain”, “Commodore”, “Treasure Hunter” & ""Gobernador""! 
Pelado fits onto El Almirante's base and comes with a unique equipment card. Only available here on Indiegogo!

 
So come on, do your bit. Loosen those purse strings. Is this really an opportunity you can afford to miss out on? Do you really want to be suffering from regretful envy next year when everybody else is showing off their shiny metally goodness, leaving you to wish you had got in on it when you had the chance? Of course you don't. Arrr! :-)
 
12 hours to go!
I am stunned and very happy of how our 10th years anniversary campaign is going so far. I would like to thank you very much for your support and the confidence you put in me and Freebooter Miniatures.
I hope that you have the same fun with the Freebooter’s Fate Legend set and our game than I will surely have sculpting these figures for you. I am really looking foreward to the next 10 years!
All the best
Werner Klocke

Noch 12 Stunden!
Und was für ein Erfolg! Ich bin glücklich und sehr stolz darauf, wie weit wir mit unserer Kampagne zu unserem 10 jährigen Jubiläum bereits gekommen sind. Vielen Dank für Eure Unterstützung und Euer Vertrauen an mich und Freebooter Miniatures!
Ich hoffe, Ihr habt ebenso viel Spaß mit dem Freebooter’s Fate Legend set und unserem Spiel Freebooter’s Fate, wie ich ihn haben werde, sie zu modellieren und zu designen. Und ich freue bereits jetzt auf die nächsten 10 Jahre!
Vielen Dank!

FAQ summary: 
It seems that the FAQ section is hidden quite well, so here is the top list of questions we have been asked:
Do I need a credit card for that? Can I pay with credit card?
Indiegogo uses Paypal AND credit card for contributions, and, in Germany at least, you do not need a credit card for Paypal use, a current bank account is sufficient.
Can I upgrade my contribution at a later stage?
Sure, if you can`t resist the temptation as more and more groovy extra bits get revealed, you can contribute the difference to what you want to have now, put a corresponding note in the comments box. Please note that downgrading your contribution is not possible.
Can I make multiple contributions for the same level?
Absolutely, go right ahead. This could be necessary if you want to have all ten Legends (needing one Captain and four Deckhand perks in total).
Can I get a single miniature of the Pirate set, but with all the bonus options?
No, sorry. In order to be able to offer the sets on Indiegogo at the prices we do, we have to group certain options together. Only the Captain perk and Captain-related ones guarantee you these updates. Deckhand perks for Virgo Despiedad, Papa Houngan and Chassa can possibly benefit from stretch goals.
Can I get Calamite Balfour in any other form than in the Captain perk?
No, sorry. Calamite is the “Indiegogo Captain Perk”-exclusive. She is the only model of this campaign that will ONLY be available at Indiegogo and ONLY for Captain or Captain based perks.
How do I have to contribute for a limited perk?
In order to contribute for a limited perk you MUST claim that perk. It is NOT possible to just make a contribution and tell us, that you want to have a limited perk. We need the counter for the limitation to go up, so that everyone can see how much limited sets are left and thus we won't fullfill any limited perk orders we received via comments only.
Can I add regular orders from the Freebooter shop to my Indiegogo contribution to gain free shipping on that order?
Yes, of course you can. Just tell us in the comments section of the Freebooter Miniatures Online Shop, that you have contributed and want to have the contribution and the regular order shipped all in one. But please note, that we ship the Inidegogo goods in March 2013, so any additional orders from our shop will also be shipped in March 2013 if you link them to the Indiegogo contribution. 
In case you don't want to wait and need some stuff from our store earlier, please have a look at our shipping conditions:
Germany: 2,50 EURO Shipping, Free Shipping on orders of 60,-+ EURO
Europe: 4,50 EURO Shipping, Free Shipping on orders of 120,-+ EURO

<p>The dreamer is the centre of all dream experiences. When we are dreaming, we are often avatars of our woken selves. We manifest, occasionally, as specific personas and alter egos but we are almost never aware of those manifestations when we are dreaming.

<p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p>
<p>We anticipate minimal risks in terms of design (they are done!), production (we have settled the major details!) and fulfilment (this is always a challenge for KS projects) for this project. Of course, getting sufficient support to make this project a reality is always the most important factor.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the main challenge is to get the decks and rewards that you pledged to you in the fastest possible time. We have gotten better at smoothing the production and fulfilment processes with our partners and striking a good balance between ensuring that the decks and rewards are of the best quality, which usually took up a fair bit of our time in refining the design and assuring quality, and timely production and fulfilment. Having said that, we always strive to do better for every project.</p>

</div></div>","The dreamer is the centre of all dream experiences. When we are dreaming, we are often avatars of our woken selves. We manifest, occasionally, as specific personas and alter egos but we are almost never aware of those manifestations when we are dreaming. We may look different, we may be of the opposite gender, we can be younger or older or we can be someone else. To the dreamer, the dream is reality. Lepidopterological musings aside, we have to agree with the Taoist allegory that it is sometimes hard to tell what is dream and what is reality.

And even then I don't have the funds to print 100 decks and call it a day. Using my existing funds I would be lucky to print 25, and who knows if I would ever be able to reprint...  I want this oracle to reach more people, so that others can benefit from this labor of love! This is an amazing opportunity to be able to gauge interest and be able to see this project finally reach fruition! This Campaign has a small goal with big dreams!  The Goal is $500, which is under 34 deck orders! Each dollar goes towards the production of the cards and the altar/reading cloths, as well as the cost of materials and the time it takes to hand-burn each tile and dice set. I also hand-make each Rosary. I am blessed to run my shop full time, but I must admit that it's not always easy, so any profit from this campaign will be split between my bills and going back into the shop, I have a list a mile long of projects waiting for the funds to be created.</p><h3>About The Perks</h3><p>The Pyxidanthera Oracle (Pyxi Oracle for short) was created over the course of 2 years- mostly I have no memory of the actual creation of the oracle; I sat down with the concept and the rest came like a whisper on the wind. It is my baby, based in my love of The Elder Futhark and created in a similar style; where a single symbol tells a story.</p><p>*The Deck: This ""Learning"" Oracle is poker sized and breaks down each symbol into its most basic parts using key words to help you easily be able to pick up and utilize this unique oracle. In addition to the 24 cards are the white Instruction Cards, these tell the story of Pyxidanthera (a young humanoid from Venus) finding the oracle, gives two example spreads as well as a more in depth meaning to each symbol. Each deck will come shrink wrapped and with a black velvet pouch for safekeeping. </p><p>*Pyxi Tiles; symbols hand- burned onto 1"" wooden disks which can be pulled from a pouch and read more similarly to the Elder Futhark Runes. Each set will come with a PDF instruction booklet which will tell the story of Pyxidanthera finding the oracle, a few example spreads as well as a more in depth meaning to each symbol. </p><p>*Pyxi Dice, the oracle is split up into four 6-sided .6"" dice, which are hand-burned and available either natural or dyed purple. They can be thrown and read according to where they land on your throwing surface as well as their relationship to eachother. (The ""Altar/Reading Cloth"" is the perfect throwing surface for these)</p><p>*Altar/Reading Cloth as a reading cloth for the cards, tiles or dice or can be used as an altar cloth or other decorative cloth. It is 14 inches x 14 inches, and is made of super soft spun polyester. </p><p>*True to the heart of my shop is a Limited Edition Alternative Rosary! The Pyxidanthera is a 5 petaled flower and as such this rosary has flower divider beads and Y connector. You can use it as a meditation tool to work with and learn this oracle, as a standard rosary (mala or affirmation beads) or simply wear it as a stunning piece of jewelry! The pendant is a symbol designed by my partner and I as a universal symbol of balance, unity and enlightenment.  </p><h3>About HadaPixie Designs</h3><p>I'm Pixie of HadaPixie Designs.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>$5,000.  That is what we need to complete this game for all to play.  We want to keep perks simple.  We do not want to promise a bunch of crazy bells and whistles when we can spend our time and your investment on making a solid game that you will not want to put down.  But, we want to offer some perks you won't get anywhere else, so we are offering copies of the game, expansion packs, and exclusive opportunities, like transforming <strong>you</strong> into a character in the game or having you join us for our live event in Los Angeles.  </p>
<p>The funding for this game will predominantly go toward the physical construction of the game pieces and distribution of the game.  Additional funding will go toward payment for the artist, Michael Bayouth, who has hand drawn every game image to be its own unique work of art. </p> <div><h3>The Team</h3></div>

<p>Our team has created live interactive events, red carpets, film festivals and gaming experiences for 12 years throughout the country including in Hollywood, New York City and Salem Massachusetts.  This past November, we opened Hotel Paranormal in Las Vegas where, for three days straight, each floor of an actual haunted hotel was the location of a unique escape room.  Throughout the weekend, guests collected trading cards from mysterious sources, vendors, celebrity guests and mysterious rooms.  Whoever collected every single card first was the winner of the GRAND CASH PRIZE of $666.  </p>

MK1881 Miniatures is the new miniature line from Maki Games, featuring high quality miniatures mainly suitable for fantasy football games and more. We offer innovative design and very high quality casts. MK1881 team is composed of many experienced artists all with several years of experience in their fields that range from design, to classic and 3D sculpting and painting.  We work only with high quality casting facilities and use only top quality materials for our creations. 
	All miniatures are made with lead free metal.
MK1881 temporary page can be found here:http://www.mk1881.comMK1881 work progress can be followed on our FB page:https://www.facebook.com/mk1881You can also follow us on out Tanatos campaign for the first team:http://igg.me/at/mk1881-tanatos2/x/5526550


Why crowd funding?
At MK1881 we have done extensive research and tests to deliver only very high quality miniatures. Designing, sculpting and printing these miniatures is quite expensive. We are looking for your contribution to speed up the printing and casting process and cover some of the costs for the design and production of special characters for this fantasy football team.ADDITIONAL SPECIAL CHARACTERS AVAILABLE:Additional models unlocked in the Tanatos Campaign are also available with the Honos. If you pledged in the campaign each additional Special will be: 6€ or also available alone for 9€ for non contributors.Hubris has received a make-up. See the updates for a almost final look of him.Eldrid is available Horken is available Irtaka is availableOur models:After several collaborations and tests we selected a selected group of professional 3D sculpting artists and 3D printing companies. Merging the experience in traditional sculpting techniques of our team with the new technologies of 3D sculpting and rapid prototyping we are able to produce top quality miniatures. Some examples can be seen in the video below. The examples below are from the Tanatos team running on our other campaign. Honos will match their quality.


We already have all the 3D models necessary to print and put in production the 
team.
A lot of time was spent to make sure models had less separated parts as 
possible, and where this was not possible we are making sure that the junctions 
are done at art to ease assembly and increase the strength of them. As a player 
I hate when my nicely painted models looses his arm during a game, and as a

It floated miles beyond the sight of mortal men, witnessing the birth and death of countless civilizations. But as time wore on and decadence laid hold to the Tempestas clan, both Stormridge Sanctum and its magnificent liege lords surrendered to the decay of time and decadence.</i></p><h3>The Premise</h3><p><i>Now a single storm giant noble remains, the haughty dilettante sorcerer-prince Clovis Tempestas II. He concerns himself only with base pleasures and none more so than his beloved stock of family wine. But his beloved wine cellar has become flooded with a foul murk and strange creatures slither between bottles of his finest family vintage. He cannot be bothered to wade into such filth himself and he has no servants remaining in his household, so he has used what little magic his grape-addled mind can recall and summoned new servants: A troupe of unsuspecting adventures who will serve -- and if necessary, die -- to save his beloved wine.</i></p><p><i>This introductory adventure can be instantly inserted into any campaign without preamble, as it opens with the player characters being the unwitting targets of a Summon Monster spell! Once summoned into the very hands of a mad and drunken giant, the player characters will find themselves exploring a realm designed for creatures ten times their size as they fight all manner of strange creature, traverse larger than life obstacles and objects, encounter other adventurers who have fallen into the clutches of the mad prince Tempestas, and even risk plummeting to their death as the very foundation of the cloud castle of Stormridge Sanctum is crumbling beneath their boots!</i></p><p><i>Can the player characters placate the whims of a giant drunk on power and lost grace?

We call it the 'Tiny Print Run'.</p><p>Thus, Indiegogo projects by Frog God Games will-</p><ul>
<li>Be short in duration</li>
<li>Be limited to a single title</li>
<li>Have options priced between $5-$30</li>
<li>Design all stretch goals and project bonus' affect the principle reward only (usually both the PDF and the softcover).</li>
<li>Be the only guaranteed method to get the <strong>premium</strong> print copy (<strong>NOTE</strong>: the softcover versions  in this printing will not be sold on our website: <i>see FAQ for explanation</i>).</li>
<li>Have simple fulfillment process that does not use Backerkit</li>
</ul><h3>Why the Tiny Print Run?</h3><p>Since 2012 our crowdfunding approach has been extravagant in every way. Ambitious with massive page counts, plus numerous add-on options and stretch goals. All supporting a primary title itself as many as 990 pages.</p><p>This has resulted in Kickstarter's with memorable pledge rewards that include top-quality hardcover books with sometimes dozens of stretch goal bonuses and add-on extras. These are awesome AND they are expensive to buy for customers like you because they are very expensive to make for publishers like us.</p><p><i>Is Frog God Games giving up on Kickstarter?</i></p><p>No. Far from it, in fact these smaller projects are happening in response to the feedback we have heard from both fans and 'almost' fans alike. We hear the request for less expensive options for our projects and products all the time. A second frequent desire expressed to us, whether at conventions, on social media or in email, is for a larger selection of smaller, faster-paced adventures that can be completed in 2-3 sessions and not necessitate a full two year campaign.</p><p>Additionally, Frog God Games has grown in both sales and brand awareness.  This opportunity will give us the additional resources to invest in the very best books in all of our formats. This will be the second project we have launched on Indiegogo for the purpose. The first, the <a href=""https://froggodgames.com/frogs/product/the-city-that-dripped-blood/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">City the Dripped Blood</a> is at the printer now for supporters and is expected to arrive more than 2 months earlier than planned. </p><h3>Project Reward </h3><p>With the wishes of the fans in mind, this and future Indiegogo projects will fund standalone projects that are both affordable and fun. This project, as well future Tiny Print Run projects, is narrowly focused with all stretch goals adding resources to the principle reward which traditionally would not be feasible for a publisher our size. </p><h3>Examples of Enhancements from Higher Funding</h3><p><span>During the 15 day primary project period for<i> I</i></span><i>n Vi</i><i>no Gigantus</i>  and after the $1500 goal is met the focus will be to improve the delivered product. The are not special tiered collectors editions or add-on purchase extras. Thus as total project funding increases the better the final product will be for everybody.</p><p>Examples of the planned extras that increased funding would bring to <i>In Vino Gigantus</i>-</p><ul>

<li>Extra written content commissioned from the author</li>

Spahn for Fifth Edition, Swords & Wizardry and the Pathfinder Role-Playing Game System.This is your chance own the premium* softcover of In Vino Gigantus the newest adventure from Frog God Games! Available for Fifth Edition, Swords & Wizardry and the Pathfinder Role-Playing Game System, this will be the first, and likely only, printing of In Vino Gigantus. This softcover is as nice as can possibly make it using a specialty print shop that is proven to deliver a variety of specialty glossy booklets for major luxury name-brand clients (and, well less well-known luxury brands like Frog God Games. In Vino Gigantus will be delivered to you on the best high-gloss paper showing off the most exciting and vivid color art afforded us- by the supporters of this Project.*expected to be between 20-24 pages with high-gloss 100 lb interior paper with card stock cover. All Softcover options include the matching PDF file and other unlocked digital extras (Player Map, New Creature Tokens, etc) which may not be in the softcover or available to PDF customers  in the future.The LocationStormridge Sanctum was once home to the the an ancient and noble line of storm giants. It floated miles beyond the sight of mortal men, witnessing the birth and death of countless civilizations. But as time wore on and decadence laid hold to the Tempestas clan, both Stormridge Sanctum and its magnificent liege lords surrendered to the decay of time and decadence.The PremiseNow a single storm giant noble remains, the haughty dilettante sorcerer-prince Clovis Tempestas II. He concerns himself only with base pleasures and none more so than his beloved stock of family wine. But his beloved wine cellar has become flooded with a foul murk and strange creatures slither between bottles of his finest family vintage. He cannot be bothered to wade into such filth himself and he has no servants remaining in his household, so he has used what little magic his grape-addled mind can recall and summoned new servants: A troupe of unsuspecting adventures who will serve -- and if necessary, die -- to save his beloved wine.This introductory adventure can be instantly inserted into any campaign without preamble, as it opens with the player characters being the unwitting targets of a Summon Monster spell! Once summoned into the very hands of a mad and drunken giant, the player characters will find themselves exploring a realm designed for creatures ten times their size as they fight all manner of strange creature, traverse larger than life obstacles and objects, encounter other adventurers who have fallen into the clutches of the mad prince Tempestas, and even risk plummeting to their death as the very foundation of the cloud castle of Stormridge Sanctum is crumbling beneath their boots!Can the player characters placate the whims of a giant drunk on power and lost grace? Will they survive encounters with the strange animated objects that have become twisted by decades of neglected magic beneath a crumbling castle? And just what the hell is that echoing boom coming from the eastern part of the wine cellar?!You’ve been granted the hospitality of the storm giant prince Clovis Tempestas II, and he’s always up for a little​ more...ABOVE: Fifth Edition Cover Mock-UpWhat to ExpectIn Vino Gigantus by James M. Spahn- available in either Fifth Edition, Pathfinder or Swords & Wizardry versions, is an adventure for introductory-level characters.Within it's covers (or the digital PDF file) you will find-
New creatures and new magic items.
NPC adventurers to serve as allies or antagonists.
An adventure told on a massive scale, where dinnerware is the size of a full-grown man, chairs must be scaled like flagpoles, and great animated objects as large as a man can spring to life.
Options for and potential expansion is provided, but the design lends itself to modifications, allowing the adventure to be included at any moment in any campaign.
Full-Color Map by Robert Altbauer
In Vino Gigantus uses the same formula introduced with our last Indiegogo, we refer to this method including the focused enhancements (stretch goals) that improve the product as total project funding increases with art, extra content written content and digital play enhancing extras (player handouts etc)...The Tiny Print RunWhy Indiegogo?Frog God Games is testing a new approach with the launch of this project- almost the inverse of how we design our crowdfunding projects on Kickstarter. We call it the 'Tiny Print Run'.Thus, Indiegogo projects by Frog God Games will-
Be short in duration
Be limited to a single title
Have options priced between $5-$30
Design all stretch goals and project bonus' affect the principle reward only (usually both the PDF and the softcover).
Be the only guaranteed method to get the premium print copy (NOTE: the softcover versions  in this printing will not be sold on our website: see FAQ for explanation).
Have simple fulfillment process that does not use Backerkit
Why the Tiny Print Run?Since 2012 our crowdfunding approach has been extravagant in every way. Ambitious with massive page counts, plus numerous add-on options and stretch goals. All supporting a primary title itself as many as 990 pages.This has resulted in Kickstarter's with memorable pledge rewards that include top-quality hardcover books with sometimes dozens of stretch goal bonuses and add-on extras. These are awesome AND they are expensive to buy for customers like you because they are very expensive to make for publishers like us.Is Frog God Games giving up on Kickstarter?No. Far from it, in fact these smaller projects are happening in response to the feedback we have heard from both fans and 'almost' fans alike. We hear the request for less expensive options for our projects and products all the time. A second frequent desire expressed to us, whether at conventions, on social media or in email, is for a larger selection of smaller, faster-paced adventures that can be completed in 2-3 sessions and not necessitate a full two year campaign.Additionally, Frog God Games has grown in both sales and brand awareness.  This opportunity will give us the additional resources to invest in the very best books in all of our formats. This will be the second project we have launched on Indiegogo for the purpose. The first, the City the Dripped Blood is at the printer now for supporters and is expected to arrive more than 2 months earlier than planned. Project Reward With the wishes of the fans in mind, this and future Indiegogo projects will fund standalone projects that are both affordable and fun. This project, as well future Tiny Print Run projects, is narrowly focused with all stretch goals adding resources to the principle reward which traditionally would not be feasible for a publisher our size. Examples of Enhancements from Higher FundingDuring the 15 day primary project period for In Vino Gigantus  and after the $1500 goal is met the focus will be to improve the delivered product. The are not special tiered collectors editions or add-on purchase extras. Thus as total project funding increases the better the final product will be for everybody.Examples of the planned extras that increased funding would bring to In Vino Gigantus-
Additional commissions for interior color art specific to the adventure
Extra written content commissioned from the author
Printed Player Maps
Downloadable Options designed for popular virtual table-top software (New creature/NPC tokens etc). 
Digital extras (player handouts etc) that are focused on quality table-top play

He also does some sculpting on the side.Mathias Rizell - creator of Flail DwarfAn amateur turned sculptor via the slippery slope of converting his own evil dwarves: It's a hobby hazard of that particular army! An eccentric Swede overly interested in all things history, aesthetics and natural science, he usually crams his sculpts with details, as you can see above!  Risks and challengesI know how important is quality, which is backed by proper mold preparation and the use of top quality materials. It is also important to keep the deadlines and I am focused to deliver all shipments as soon as possible to their new owners.Currently, I am the boss of myself and I care about everything from the idea through design, execution to sales. The only fear I have is that the new models delivery time may be slightly longer when the number of users increases. I would like to ask for understanding, and I undertake to ensure that the entire process of sculpting miniatures from stretch goals, casting and shipping will go smoothly. Of course, I will inform you about the progress of my work on a regular basis.",36.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We made a party card game, and we need to grow an audience. Having a booth at conventions is a HUGE part of that. However, we've spent all our money on developing the game! It's incredibly important that we raise enough money to get a booth and some basic trade show materials for 2020. With your help, we can make that happen!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $500 to set up our first booth at a convention. Half of that will go towards the booth space itself, and the other half will buy a branded table cover and a sign.</p>
<p>Every dollar raised past our initial goal will gear us up for a year of trekking from convention to convention to put Fib in as many hands possible, so that we can make the game the best that it can be before we raise money for inventory!</p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign, you are helping us launch this dream that we've worked SO hard on. Of course, you will get our free Print and Play, which you can download anytime, and you will be on the ground-floor of the most exciting new game of the next decade!</p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal, we will use the funds we did raise towards a booth at a later convention!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Fib is unique, it's a highly social game that stays fresh every time you play. We've seen people's reactions--their laughter, enthusiasm, and interest is what's kept us going.</p>
<p>We know we're onto something here, and we need to get the game out to more people. By attending conventions, we can start spreading awareness and bringing more people along with us on this journey as we prepare to order inventory!</p>
<p>This is a game that's meant to be played again and again, for years and years. It should be on everyone's shelves who enjoys games of this genre.</p>
<p>I have been a part of a number of creative endeavors, and none have excited me as much as Fib. We will be working tirelessly to get this game out into the world, but we've exhausted our own ability to pay for that effort. What we will never run out of is TIME and ENERGY. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge right now is growing our audience. We can't raise enough funds for inventory if we don't have a large audience to help us, and we can't grow that large audience without attending conventions and becoming an integral part of the tabletop gaming community.</p>
<p>Luckily, we are ambitious and ready to travel to everywhere our audience congregates! The risk is that we won't have enough money to attend the most crucial events. That's what makes this campaign so important.</p>
<p>Our plan is to use the funds we raise from this campaign to reach as many people as possible. This includes getting trade show materials, booth space, a production-ready prototype, and traveling to the most crucial tabletop game conventions in the country.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please share our campaign with your friends and family, through social media, carrier pigeon, or megaphone!</p>

<h3>About Interdimesional Workspace</h3>
<p>It started with a dream, Our Founder Jacob Miller wanted to create a company to help those with ideas and visions without the means to start them. Originally intended as a custom parts manufacturer and source for independent inventors, finding the funding to start was anything but easy to come by. After almost a decade of building and learning, Jacob met the outsider artist (and sometimes vagabond) known as Paisley Straenj, who had nearly the same idea twenty years before. Together these two independent thinking, self-motivated creators compared their notes, put their heads together, and came up with the formula that became Interdimensional Work space LLC. A dream factory for the outsiders, help for those who lack the ways and means to make their ideas reality.

At 50,000$, we will add 3 casino quality playing chips (red, black, and blue).
And at 150,000$, everyone will receive 1 5x7 inch signed and numbered giclee art print     (of their choice) with a certificate of authenticity.

Just the Beginning for Wildcards
As incredible as we think this deck is, Paisley has promised more, much more. Going forward, we hope to launch the first expansion pack for Wildcard with another suit of 14 more original jokers, celebrating the world's most popular playing card.

Join our mailing list to receive updates, surveys, and the chance to get in on our giveaways.
Follow us on facebook, and share your love of the joker with us.
Please help share this project and support independent art.


Final Thoughts and Future Goals
Interdimensional Workspace is a privately owned LLC established with expressed goal of helping to enable independent and outsider artists to find funding, establish production, and find their audience no matter where they are located.  We would like to thank everyone who took the time out to check our very first campaign. We also hope you are as excited as we are to help this amazing independent artist find his audience. However while Paisley might be the first artist we hope to empower, we are looking for more. So, if you or know of an outsider artist who needs help with a missing element for success, we would love to hear from you and we definitely want to hear your ideas.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

worked in the past have always been top quality casts, and we have produced 
hundreds of models for other companies in the past.

(see details on the ARES campaign)  This includes any of the Star Players. This is an extra 8.50€ value added. Or a free set of dice from the Tanatos, Honos or Cabiri. You will be asked at the end of the campaign.Size Comparison:During the creation of the Tanatos team, 
and W.I.P pics several have questioned the size of the models. Below courtesy by RN estudio 
there is a picture of the actual models next to some existing well known models for comparison 
purposes. It was an overall opinion that the selected size is the best to match 
any current range. Previously done models: Below you can see the final result of the first campaign. All models shown where painted by Axia, awaiting the box art by RNestudio.TANATOSHONOSMore detailed pictures can be found on Maki-Games.comRisk and Challenges:Not many, all the 3D models are 
done and visible, the printing facility was chosen and selected for his highest 
printing standard, test models where done to make sure the materials and size 
are adequate to obtain the highest standard product. We have already ordered and 
paid for the metal for this production. Many can testify that any models we have 
worked in the past have always been top quality casts, and we have produced 
hundreds of models for other companies in the past. At this stage the only challenge is to ship all the items according to the planned schedule and to unlock enough stretch goals to create the special characters for this team. This is our 4th team, the first 2 had a significant delay in shipping due to some issues we didn't plan. Last team the Ares will be shipped while this campaign is running.Box Art Team: RN Estudio will be painting the box art of this team and the painted team will be for sale. If interested please contact me or Rafa at RN for more details. During the campaign we will show more painted models.Prices:The prices set in the campaign have a significant discount and shipping included. These prices will be no longer available from us in the future. Our policy is to keep prices stable and avoid crazy holidays or event discount in order to protect our present and future distributors / store sales. So this is your chance to save some cash on our products: don't miss it. Additional notes:- All the models will be made using very high quality lead free metal that matches or exceeds the standards required by law in all the states that these miniatures will be sent. - Models will be provided un-assembled and unpainted.- Models are not intended for kids 14yrs old or younger due to small parts, - Each model will come with a matching 25mm round plastic base.",26.0,0,"6 Campaigns

You’ll find 3 sequences on each side of the book.      After testing the first prototypes, we were fairly satisfied with the result, however we still missed  some of the most important events that took place. What about those crucial moments that helped to make this journey a success, but couldn’t be filmed because they happened out there in space? We wanted to create a flip book that not only tells this story, but also really makes you understand what happened out there. That’s how Volume 2 came up.    Luckily, as we have our own flip book and animation studio, the solution was not too far away: during our research we learned about the original concept art, created by NASA artists in 1966 to explain the main stages of the mission to the broader public, so we decided to select the illustrations of the stages we were missing and turn them into animations. As a result, Vol 2 has 6 more sequences depicting the moon landing from a more technical and informative point of view, whilst maintaining an artistic approach through the handmade paintings. They are some of the most important maneuvers performed by the astronauts, such as the stage separations and docking procedures and the lunar orbit insertion of the CSM-LM module. Here they are in detail:     Both flip books are intended to complement each other, so if you switch between the real footage and the animated sequences, together they become a powerful educational tool that explains the whole process of the Apollo journey.   Because we like challenges and really want to take flip books to the next level, we decided to add an interactive component to the edition. That’s why we added an exclusive Augmented Reality feature to the flip book edition that gives you more insight into the three main spacecrafts used by the astronauts to accomplish this remarkable mission.Each of the flip books includes a different 3D model that can be displayed on your mobile device right above the flip book. On Vol. 1 you'll see the powerful Saturn V rocket, on Volume 2 the Command and Service Module docked together with the Lunar Module and when both flip books are packed together in the Anniversary Edition slipcase (Flip Book Set), you can see a real-time 3D animation of the last exciting moments of “The Eagle” before it touches the surface of the moon - well actually before it touches the surface of the flip book. :)   Each of these 3D models will incorporate extra detailed information about the technical specifications of each spacecraft, combining videos and additional text. This way, you can not only engage with your Apollo 11 Flip Book, but most importantly, you can learn more about the mission and the vehicles the astronauts used throughout their journey.  For the development of the AR content we work hand in hand with our friends from the British studio Seymour & Lehrn, specializing in the creation of AR and VR content for virtual experiences. With their help, we will develop our own Flipboku Apollo 11 AR app, which you can easily download for IOS and Android.   Those of you familiar with our last flip book project Molecularis, may already have an idea about how the magic works. If you observe the flip book in closer detail, you will notice that the edges are cut in a specific way, so that you can swap between the different sequences. This is the key to the optical illusion that gives the Apollo 11 Flip Book its unique feature of showing you six different animations, one after another - you'll have a blast watching people's faces when they see the flip book for the first time and try to understand how it works! :D    And here's the secret: it all depends on the position of your thumb. You can switch between the sequences by placing your thumb either in the upper corner, the center or the lower corner of the front edge of the book. As there are 3 sequences on each side of the book, the images are arranged alternately. This means that you will have sequences 1, 2 and 3 on the A-side and 4, 5 and 6 on the B-side of the book, when you turn it around. This works the same for both flip books, resulting in a total of 12 different sequences.    With the aim of providing you with maximum enjoyment of the whole epic Apollo experience, we have developed a complementary educational tool for those of you wanting to gain additional insight, not only about the Apollo 11, but about the entire Apollo Program. Who were the astronauts, which spacecraft did they use, and which experiments did they perform during the different lunar explorations? To answer these questions, we created a deck of 70 neatly designed Commemorative Cards, representing three different categories: 32 astronauts of all the Apollo missions, 18 of the science experiments set up by the astronauts at the landing site of each of the five Apollo missions to land on the moon, and 20 cards showing the vehicles and hardware that brought them there – and back to earth.   Each of the illustrated cards includes basic information of the displayed subject, and also includes a QR code that takes you to the specific page on Wikipedia where you can find out even more about each of the many components of the Apollo Program. You can also combine the cards into different groups by joining all the astronauts of a specific mission as well as their scientific experiments and vehicles, or turn it into a question-and-answer game and not only learn from it, but have a lot of fun with your friends and family.  We couldn't help but include a little flip book feature in the card deck! If you hold all the cards in the correct order, you will be able to see a 360º animation of the Lunar Module while flipping the cards with your thumb. :D    For all those passionate space lovers out there who want the full experience, we’ve created an exclusive bundle with 150 units available only for our Indiegogo backers. This one of a kind Limited Edition tier includes a real fragment of mission-flown Kapton Foil that protected the Columbia Command Module during its re-entry to Earth. This unique piece is preserved in a small commemorative acrylic container that comes individually numbered and with your name on it. A unique collector's item for those who want to hold a real piece of human history in their hands.   The Limited Edition Foil Bundle will come in a sleek packaging that we’ve created especially for the occasion, along with the Apollo 11 Flip Book Set (which comes with all three 3D AR models) and the Apollo 11 Commemorative Cards. The limited edition includes a Certificate of Authenticity with additional information on the origin and traceability of the foil.    We are passionate about great packaging, which is why all our flip books come in their own sleek slip case which not only looks attractive, but also protects them from wear and tear.   Furthermore, the Apollo 11 Anniversary Edition (Flip Book Set) has a double slip case with a stunning  gold embossing we’ve created for this special occasion,  so that you can keep both flip books together.  We only use environmentally-friendly materials, such as acid-free sustainable forest paper. All materials are from local providers to keep our project as sustainable as possible (this means European materials for us). We have chosen a semi-gloss coated paper with the perfect thickness and elasticity so that the pages slide smoothly when you flip them with your thumb. Every single Apollo 11 Flip Book is largely hand-produced and the whole process requires a number of steps that rely on careful supervision, which is why the entire production process will be carried out in our very own printing studio in Mallorca, Spain. Our experienced printing technicians will take care of the complex manufacturing process which requires absolute precision to ensure that the sequences perform perfectly.  Here you can see a small making-of video of the Apollo 11 prototypes: 
 
 
  Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 are two separate flip books in their own right but they complement each other beautifully. When combined, the real footage and the animated sequences provide extraordinary insight into the entire Apollo 11 mission.You can choose between the following combinations:    Flipboku is the brainchild of animator and designer Jossie Malis and music composer Julie Reier. Besides loving animation and flip books, we're also huge space enthusiasts, so we are thrilled at the idea of creating something unique for the 50th anniversary of this memorable achievement. With Flipboku, we want to bring flip books to the next level and create unique editions, that are not only fun, but also useful either in a creative, artistic or educational way.Since our last project Molecularis, the Flipboku team has grown and now consists of 6 members, all working in our design and printing studio Boku Lab. The team is completed with the invaluable hands of illustrator and graphic designer Noemi Aiolo, and the 3 members of our irreplaceable printing crew Gustavo Berdayes, Tomás Ponsand José Ramón Pineda, who are responsible for the development of the prototypes and for leading the entire production process.   We are extremely grateful for your support and would love to welcome you on board!  We would especially like to thank NASA video librarian Sheva Moore for her support through the incredible film archive and Bert Ulrich from the NASA multimedia and content department, to Andy Bernstein for his support with the video narration and Victoria Amengual for her help with the writing.  Also special thanks to our webmaster Israel and our dearest Angel, Mireia, Anselm, Marcos, Raquel, Angel, Nuria, Naru, Yui, Yuko, Nadal and Alejandro for their participation in our video.      Risks and challengesDuring our last project we learnt the hard way that you can never be prepared enough when it comes to producing something that has never been done before. No matter how well prepared you are, you will always have to reckon with unexpected situations as long as you are dependent on third-party providers. For this reason and because we not only want to give ourselves, but all our backers the certainty that everything will run smoothly, we’ve set up our own printing workshop, where 100% of all the production steps are carried out. Our experienced printing technicians will personally take care of the production process to ensure that production is executed to perfection, so that all our backers receive a product of the highest possible quality and as quickly as possible.",53.0,1,"4 Campaigns

The heart of our site is one of the most talked-about forums in the industry — with 12,000 active members and almost 19 million posts. We also publish several gaming reviews every week and a few columns. Finally, we maintain a constantly expanding catalog of roleplaying products that currently indexes 19,000 games and supplements, 2,000 magazines, and 36,000 articles.Note: Despite a typo in the expected shipping day for the Membership perk, our goal is to make sure that everything is allocated no later than January 2018 ... not ten years ago!All of this costs money, so in 2013 we decided to turn to crowdfunding to encourage readers to become members, to support the site. The drive was successful, so we've turned into a yearly tradition.In years past, we've thanked our members with proactive work that's helped to make the site a better place.

<p>Imagine a land, far away in space and time, dominated in the past by a cruel race of sorcerer-priests, the Keronians. Cursed by the gods, their empire was wiped out by a cataclysm, the fall of the Dread Star, which has thrown the world into barbarism and created the Dread Sea Dominions from the scattered ruins of the past.</p>
<p>It is a world of savage barbarians who venture into ancient ruins to save scantily-clad damsels from a fate worse than death at the claws of pre-human beastmen.</p>
<p>It is a world of chainmail bikini amazons fighting in the sun-scorched arenas of Faberterra to appease the crowds of the decadent cities of the Iron Empire.</p>
<p>It is a world where dark sorcerers invoke the forbidden names of demons in temples old before mankind took its first, hesitant, steps outside the caverns of the north.</p>
<p>This is the world of Beasts &amp; Barbarians, where everything is built to evoke the feel of the pulp fantasy stories of the ’30s!</p>

<h3>Tomes of Ancient Lore</h3>
<p>This booklet will have something both for the Players and the GM.</p>
<p><strong>For the Players</strong>: Star Signs of the Dominions! Heroes and gods are born under a particular star, the Priest Princes of Tricarnia say, and this small sourcebook introduces a new characterization option for your heroes: star signs! Each of them (draw a card during character creation to see which) gives a hero a particular knack, but also a Doom, something which is written in the stars for him (a useful adventure hook).</p>
<p><strong>For the GM: Blades of the Dominions</strong>: A Sword &amp; Sorcery Combat Scenes sourcebook. B&amp;B adventures are famous for their detailed and compelling combat scenes. A small sourcebook of ready-to-play combat scenes (with terrains, chosen enemies, tactics and so on), each with Golden and Steel Bennies.</p>
<p>For example: interrupting a dark rite, escape through the snow, chase in the forest, charge into battle, naval combat, sorcerous duel, find the assassin. Plus a table of ""ready to use"" terrain elements (pillars, barrels, crowds of people etc...)</p>

About Beasts and Barbarians!
Imagine a land, far away in space and time, dominated in the past by a cruel race of sorcerer-priests, the Keronians. Cursed by the gods, their empire was wiped out by a cataclysm, the fall of the Dread Star, which has thrown the world into barbarism and created the Dread Sea Dominions from the scattered ruins of the past.
It is a world of savage barbarians who venture into ancient ruins to save scantily-clad damsels from a fate worse than death at the claws of pre-human beastmen.
It is a world of chainmail bikini amazons fighting in the sun-scorched arenas of Faberterra to appease the crowds of the decadent cities of the Iron Empire.
It is a world where dark sorcerers invoke the forbidden names of demons in temples old before mankind took its first, hesitant, steps outside the caverns of the north.
This is the world of Beasts & Barbarians, where everything is built to evoke the feel of the pulp fantasy stories of the ’30s!

I have always been fascinated by power dynamics and struggles for power in the international or internal realm. I wanted to create a game that explores this topic in the comfort of the home. What makes a leader last? If it was a strong economy, the Kim Family wouldn't still be in power, if it was reforming society Khrushchev wouldn't have been ousted from the party in the USSR, if it was the most powerful army WWII would have ended much differently. So, Supreme Leader is supposed to answer the question of how does someone assume dictatorial powers and remain in that role? For me, I thought of this game when I was in my Russian Politics class and learned about Stalin's rise in the Soviet Union and how he was able to connive and weave his way into power over other higher ranking Bolsheviks and I was inspired even further in my French History class that showed how Napoleon was able to subvert the French Revolution and name himself Emperor for Life. </p><p>The characters in the game are not there for shock value or a cash-grab this is a thought out game to explore power dynamics and the nuance of politics on a table. We understand that some of these characters may make some players uneasy, but we would just like to remind people that we don't condone any of the heinous or despotic decisions made by some of these leaders, but it would be disingenuous to not include leaders in the game that is delving into this issue. And mostly, the game is meant to be fun. It's strategy and a party game where friends are debating on voting for their friends and creating alliances and betraying their friends. If a leader bothers someone at the table, don't play with it! </p><p>- Jackson Herold, the designer</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551155388/q9wdytfsywcyjyzlq73u.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Facebook | <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/cardculturegames/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/cardculturegames/</a><br/>Twitter | <a href=""https://twitter.com/card_culture"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://twitter.com/card_culture</a><br/>Instagram | <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/cardculturegames/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.instagram.com/cardculturegames/</a><br/>Youtube I <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxouA2tu-yHmJYR217msvSQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxouA2tu-yHmJY...</a></p><p>Website: <a href=""http://www.cardculturegames.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.cardculturegames.com</a><br/>BoardGameGeek: BGG-SupremeLeader</p><p>Email: Cardculturegames@gmail.com </p><p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551155442/qknoowh158z21mkh8yrg.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551155473/c39oqydlidvykdbl8jr3.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Jackson Herold - Game Designer</strong><br/><br/>Jackson Herold is a recent graduate from the University of Central Florida.

You will produce an income, make deals with other players, bribe your way out of tough spots, and purchase cards to bolster your plays and diminish your foes. However, be careful of how and who you send to the United Nations, because they will have to vote for you to become Supreme Leader in the final round of the game.  With the base game, you have all you need to begin on your journey towards becoming Supreme Leader. The box will include 20 player cards (with the leaders pictured below), 60 Strategy Cards, 20 Event Cards, wooden income pieces, and a rulebook.  With the base game, you will be able to play games of Supreme Leader with 5-10 players with an estimated playtime of 1 hour. Income pieces will be included in the box for players to collect as their income to use as a means to purchase Strategy Cards, make bribes, forge deals, and activate abilities.  The promo leader pack will include 10 new leaders. Check out our rulebook at cardculturegames.comIf you would like to try our Print n Play, email us at cardculturegames@gmail.comComponents Player Card - Player cards are the historical leaders players will play as for the duration of the game. A player card will detail the leader's faction, income, influence, and special ability.Strategy Card - Strategy Cards are cards that players can purchase from the marketplace during gameplay. These can be offensive, defensive, and economic in their nature. Their effects vary from stopping a person from voting, allowing cards to be purchased for a discount, or eliminating a player to the United Nations.Event Cards - Event Cards are cards that are drawn after every elimination phase. They come in two types. Red and Green. A Red Event Card happens and the effect challenges players for the following round. These Event Cards cause the power dynamics to shift and change what players want to do for the round. A Green Event Card is an Event Card that brings a player out of the United Nations and back in play as an Active Player.  Base GameDue to the success of Supreme Leader on Kickstarter, we as a team have decided to include 5 additional leaders for the for the first print of Supreme Leader.

Apapico works tirelessly at building his reputation as an anime artist, and we think it shows. His technique of using bold neon colors in an almost surreal but simplistic setting really draws you in. </p><p>In Surfer Girls, it appears that the walls of reality are being torn away, allowing us to look in from another dimension at two young ladies enjoying a late summer afternoon as the sun starts to set, casting shafts of light and shadows about the room.  The girl sipping ramune, or soda, is possibly reminiscing about the day’s activities and what they’ll do tomorrow, while the other girl is deep in the moment of her reading, or studying, while her cat dreams blissfully next to her. There is so much you can get out of this picture, and we think it would make a fantastic puzzle, as with all our puzzles.

Apapico works tirelessly at building his reputation as an anime artist, and we think it shows. His technique of using bold neon colors in an almost surreal but simplistic setting really draws you in. In Surfer Girls, it appears that the walls of reality are being torn away, allowing us to look in from another dimension at two young ladies enjoying a late summer afternoon as the sun starts to set, casting shafts of light and shadows about the room.  The girl sipping ramune, or soda, is possibly reminiscing about the day’s activities and what they’ll do tomorrow, while the other girl is deep in the moment of her reading, or studying, while her cat dreams blissfully next to her. There is so much you can get out of this picture, and we think it would make a fantastic puzzle, as with all our puzzles. We hope you agree. What We’re Offering
Exact Puzzle Dimensions: 27.52"" x 19.57"" (69.90 cm x 49.70 cm)
Each puzzle comes in a Limited Edition box: 14 5/8"" x 10 5/8"" x 2 1/8"" (37.16 cm x 27 cm x 6.68 cm). 
Each puzzle and box has a textured linen finish, featuring pristine imagery with bright, bold, and beautiful colors. 
Manufactured in Europe with the highest quality materials. 
Certificate of Authenticity and Exclusive Postcard included with each puzzle.
 This CampaignIn addition to Surfer Girls we are also offering The Gargoyle Keeper by Scott Gustafson, Welcoming all Wonders and Dragon King's Daughter by Fuzichoco, as well as Spring in Sakuragaoka by Aymeric Kevin and A Late Breakfast by Imoman, two puzzles that were produced last year thanks to some amazing Kickstarter and Indiegogo backers!

Anyone who knows how to add, subtract, multiply and divide single digit numbers can play. Yet, one needs to plan the usage of numbers and symbols well enough to outsmart the opponent and win. The following are some important factors to keep in mind to play well: </p><ul><li>Multiplication's Nemesis: Number 1</li></ul><p>A multiplication symbol usually yields a higher result. However, you may not want to use it when your opponent has the number tile 1. Here's why: </p><ul style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<li> 6 x 1 = 6 while 6 + 1 = 7. Opponent earns a point. </li>
<li> 6 x 1 = 6 and 6 / 1 is also = 6. Both players earn a point.</li>
</ul><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508252488/pqpsf7mnmjdi1xum0wko.jpg"" src=""""/></p><ul><li>Subtraction vs division</li></ul><p><i>Note: when using subtraction, always subtract the lesser number from the greater number and when using division, always divide the greater number by the lesser number. </i></p><p>To achieve higher results, the best bets are to use multiplication and addition. But there are only six of those, which means you still need to figure out when to use subtraction or division symbols for at least three rounds.  Here's the logic to keep in mind for such situations: </p><ul style=""margin-left:40px;""><li>Subtraction will yield a higher result than division in most cases except when the two numbers used are consecutive. When consecutive numbers are used, subtraction results are always 1, but division results are &gt;=1 and &lt;=2.</li></ul><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508252529/umg2zooazpywyygr9kol.jpg"" src=""""/></p><ul><li>Mystery Numbers Are The Key</li></ul><p>For more serious players who understand math well, mystery numbers hold the key to winning. One must try to maximize points won through mystery numbers, which requires careful planning of number and symbol combinations. A generalized thumb rule would be:</p><ul style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<li>For mystery numbers that are &gt;4, addition symbol is most useful.</li>
<li>For mystery numbers &lt;=4, subtraction symbol is most useful.</li>
</ul><p>Make the best use of these symbols by using them as a second player and making the right number combinations to match the results with your mystery numbers</p><ul style=""margin-left:40px;""><li>Perfect Combinations: By using the right symbol and number combinations, you may be able to match both results with your two mystery numbers in the same round. </li></ul><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508253383/bdxjqgpsqvpnohez6obz.jpg"" src=""""/></p><ul style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<li>Observe Opponent's Moves: While trying to earn points through mystery numbers, players leave hints about their mystery numbers. Try to guess quickly and make sure you limit potential opportunities for the opponent to make points using his/her mystery numbers. On the other hand, your opponent also tries to guess your mystery numbers. Try bluffing to give wrong hints. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508258276/fcth5dj8do9sk3bjmr3d.jpg"" src=""""/>
</li>
<li>Push Results Beyond Mystery Board: Mystery board only awards points for results that exactly match whole numbers between 1 and 9. By yielding results that are &gt;9 (using multiplication and addition) or have decimal values (using division), you can make sure that the opponent doesn't get points from mystery board. </li>

Planning when to use which number and symbol combination holds the key to winning. And the combination changes every time you play due to two randomly chosen mystery numbers that are hidden from opponents and award bonus points in the end. Mind Your Numbers is not only a revolutionary way for kids to practice arithmetic, but also eases math anxiety and over time, develops a curiosity to learn. We need your support to bring Mind Your Numbers to life and change the way kids all over the world perceive math. Watch us play a full game to understand a player's thoughts, strategies and learning while playing Mind Your Numbers here:

 
See the full video of how to play including three- and four-player versions here:Place the two player boards and the mystery board in the center. Each player gets nine numbers and twelve symbols that are arranged such that they remain visible to the opponent at all times. Choose who plays first; to decide randomly, players may pick one mystery number each and the one with higher number plays first. Shuffle the nine mystery numbers with their face down and pick two numbers each. Keep the brown and red cubes handy.The game is played over nine rounds. In each round, the following five steps are repeated. 
Players place one symbol and one number on their boards in the following order: 
Player 1 places any one symbol.
Player 2 places any one symbol other than that placed by Player 1.
Player 1 places any one number.
Player 2 places any one number.



Based on the tiles used, two simple calculations are made. The player with higher result wins the round and earns one brown cube, which denotes one point: 
Player 1's Result: Player 1's Number <Player 1's Symbol> Player 2's Number.
Player 2's Result: Player 2's Number <Player 2's Symbol> Player 1's Number.



If either or both results are exactly equal to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, place one brown cube each in their places on the mystery board.

Discard the used numbers and symbols.

Exchange player boards such that Player 2 in this round plays first the next round.

Repeat these steps for nine rounds i.e., until all numbers are exhausted and only three symbols remain unused. At the end of nine rounds, players reveal their mystery numbers and collect the cubes available from the corresponding numbers on the mystery board. Count each brown cube as one point and each red cube as three points. The player with most total points wins the game.  By adding just one more set of the same box, the game can be expanded to include three or four players. Use the other side of the player boards and number & symbol tiles for three or four players. Use only one mystery board and one set of mystery numbers.There are three main differences between a two-player and a three- or a four-player game: 
Comparisons: A two player game involves only one comparison in each round. However, using the same number and symbol combinations, a three-player game involves three comparisons and a four-player game involves four comparisons in each round. 

Player Symbols: In a two player game, Player 2's symbol may not match that used by Player 1.
In a three-player game, Player 2's symbol may not match that of Player 1 and Player 3's symbol may not match that of both Player 2 AND Player 1.
Similarly, in a four-player game, Player 2's symbol may not match that of Player 1, Player 3's symbol may not match that of Player 2 and Player 4's symbol may not match that of both Player 3 AND Player 1.


​​Exchange Of Player Boards: At the end of each round, player boards are rotated in clockwise direction with the following exceptions: In a three-player game:At the end of round 4, instead of rotating in clockwise direction, exchange player boards 1 and 3. This changes the direction of comparison for the second half of the game. Continue rotating in clockwise direction from round 5. 


 In a four-player game: 
At the end of round 4, instead of rotating in clockwise direction, exchange player boards 1 and 3. 
At the end of round 8, exchange player boards 1 and 4. This allows the players sitting opposite to each other compete for at least one round.


Mind Your Numbers is an easy game to understand how to play. Anyone who knows how to add, subtract, multiply and divide single digit numbers can play. Yet, one needs to plan the usage of numbers and symbols well enough to outsmart the opponent and win. The following are some important factors to keep in mind to play well: Multiplication's Nemesis: Number 1A multiplication symbol usually yields a higher result. However, you may not want to use it when your opponent has the number tile 1. Here's why: 
 6 x 1 = 6 while 6 + 1 = 7. Opponent earns a point. 
 6 x 1 = 6 and 6 / 1 is also = 6. Both players earn a point.
Subtraction vs divisionNote: when using subtraction, always subtract the lesser number from the greater number and when using division, always divide the greater number by the lesser number. To achieve higher results, the best bets are to use multiplication and addition. But there are only six of those, which means you still need to figure out when to use subtraction or division symbols for at least three rounds.  Here's the logic to keep in mind for such situations: Subtraction will yield a higher result than division in most cases except when the two numbers used are consecutive. When consecutive numbers are used, subtraction results are always 1, but division results are >=1 and <=2.Mystery Numbers Are The KeyFor more serious players who understand math well, mystery numbers hold the key to winning. One must try to maximize points won through mystery numbers, which requires careful planning of number and symbol combinations. A generalized thumb rule would be:
For mystery numbers that are >4, addition symbol is most useful.
For mystery numbers <=4, subtraction symbol is most useful.
Make the best use of these symbols by using them as a second player and making the right number combinations to match the results with your mystery numbersPerfect Combinations: By using the right symbol and number combinations, you may be able to match both results with your two mystery numbers in the same round. 
Observe Opponent's Moves: While trying to earn points through mystery numbers, players leave hints about their mystery numbers. Try to guess quickly and make sure you limit potential opportunities for the opponent to make points using his/her mystery numbers. On the other hand, your opponent also tries to guess your mystery numbers. Try bluffing to give wrong hints. 

Push Results Beyond Mystery Board: Mystery board only awards points for results that exactly match whole numbers between 1 and 9. By yielding results that are >9 (using multiplication and addition) or have decimal values (using division), you can make sure that the opponent doesn't get points from mystery board. 

Nine Numbers (1 to 9): Two sets, one for each player. Turn backside for three- and four-player colors.

Twelve Symbols (addition, subtraction, multiplication & division): Two sets, three of each type. Turn backside for three- and four-player colors.

Two Player Boards: One board for each player. Turn backside for three or four players. Note that the placeholders for numbers and symbols and the rules associated with symbol placement are clearly marked on each board.

Nine Mystery Numbers (1 to 9): One set to make sure each player gets a different mystery number. Use only one set for three or four players as well.

One Mystery Board: With the numbers 1 to 9 marked, the mystery board allows players to keep track of the player results in each round.

Brown & Red Cubes: Wooden cubes for players to keep track of their points. Each brown cube denotes one point and each red cube denotes three points. Every time a player has three brown cubes, replace with one red cube. The same may be done on the mystery board as well.

Game Rules: Fully illustrated rules sheet with clear steps and order to follow to play the game. Includes detailed instructions for three and four players as well. See a pdf version here.

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

</div></div>","I used a previous campaign (in the dark ages of 2014) to produce my first range (Evil men miniatures). You can always have a look here : Laran miniatures.
I since connected with a bunch of 10mm enthusiasts playing Fantasy games in 10mm. I produced more minis thanks to the financial participation of the members of the Minihammer group on FB. Thank you very much Martin Dahl for pestering me about your need of 10mm characters. Thanks to everyone else for trusting me.I feel it is now time to introduce a full new range : The Unseen.
 

 
 
From their underground lairs, the Unseen pour on the world to finally reclaim their legitimate possession : survival of the fittest. Nobody has ever meet one of these abhumans and survived to tell his story. Hearsays state that you can have a glimpse at some disgusting grouts and tails if you have the misfortune to cross path with one of them ; they never lurk alone though. 
I propose to bring to life these evil lurkers with core units, characters, monsters, warmachines and more...With your help I'll pay for all the moulds (preproduction and production) and get the machine going.
 

The range - description and pricing
I intend to produce 10 different packs to begin with :


5 Credits - Warriors : 20 assorted one hand weapons with shields. Banner and musician included.

5 Credits - Slaves : 20 blades. 2 slavers with whip included.

5 Credits - Lep-priests : 20 flails bearer. Banner included.

5 Credits - Nin-rats : 20 assorted one hand weapons. (Even seen some throwing stars in there). Banner and musician included.

5 Credits - Techno-elite : 20 elite warriors with two handed great weapons. Banner and musician included.

5 Credits - Ra-trolls : 4 giant unholy creatures. (eye-level : 20mm)

10 Credits - Characters : 5 human sized heroes and 1 Ra-troll leader.

7 Credits - Great Avatar : Incarnation of the god of the Unseen (eye-level 28mm)

8 Credits - Wheel of misfortune : one giant machinery to roll onto your enemies. (30mm diameter)

10 Credits - Multipurpose Frame : one giant machinery pushed around by 2 Ra-trolls. Included 3 options to build a catapulte trébuchet, an energy cannon or a giant wrecking ball.Stretch Goals :


5 Credits - Special weapons team : 20 infantry with long rifles, chemical weapons...exact proportions remain to be decided.

5 Credits - Mischief of rats : A swarm of rats to infest your dungeons, caves or streets. (Exact content of the pack to be determined)

5 credits - Evil men Raiders : 12 Light cavalry for the Evil men. Banner and Musician included.

7 credits - Evil men Giant : 40 mm top of the head.

7 Credits - Good men Griffon : one Hero on Griffon.

7 Credits - Giant Rat : pretty self explanatory.

3 credits - Slavery Bell : Option of weapon for the MPF. The slaves and their masters gather when the metallic sound echoes in the canyons, as they know it means only one thing : War.


 
Here are some early concepts :

<p>We recently finished Funding to 2500% on Kickstarter and are excited to continue to offer our product to the Indiegogo community as an in-demand campaign! The digital product is complete and available for immediate download!  Resin Cast forts are now available in white and color resin!</p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/eeb2or0lE2w?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>Stronghold on the Borderlands is an effort to create a fort that would exist as a garrison or trading station in a borderland fantasy setting for 25-32mm Miniatures. The idea pursues the notion of a timber fort being constructed on part/on top of an older ruined stone fortification. I used this mixed aesthetic so that the fort might also be applicable as a tribal center for barbarian and goblinoid cultures.</p>
<p>This set utilizes both OpenLOCK and Non-Openlock approaches. </p>

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>I started this as a RPG resale company in late 2012 and shipped out around 100k in gross product sales between 2012-2015. During this same time I transitioned and retrained myself from traditional art to a 3D designer. Some of my resale profits were used to finance my digital fabrication interest. In late 2015 I suspended resale operations to move my family and begin development as a part time freelance designer and manufacturer. I’ve designed and redesigned this structure off and on over the last year between other 3D work and my regular job as a Studio Art Technician at Murray State University.</p>
<p>I’ve designed several other castle structures that I put out as open source releases. Some of these designs hi-light my interest in mashing a number of methods and materials together, others are simple structures based on abandoned designs ideas. More info can be seen on the web sites listed.</p>

The digital product is complete and available for immediate download!  Resin Cast forts are now available in white and color resin!
Short Summary

Stronghold on the Borderlands is an effort to create a fort that would exist as a garrison or trading station in a borderland fantasy setting for 25-32mm Miniatures. The idea pursues the notion of a timber fort being constructed on part/on top of an older ruined stone fortification. I used this mixed aesthetic so that the fort might also be applicable as a tribal center for barbarian and goblinoid cultures.
This set utilizes both OpenLOCK and Non-Openlock approaches.

<h2>Feast of the Gobbler</h2>
<p>What evils lurk in the deep woods? Only the Gobbler Knows!</p>
<p>The Ennie nominated adventure originally released over 16 years ago returns with a fury of bad puns and just desserts!</p>
<p>This adventure designed for 3-5th level characters takes you deep into the eternal autumn of the Greenhill Woods. Here the characters find themselves caught in the midst of a conflict between settlers and native folk at odds over a recent rash of deaths and disappearances. Their exploration of the region takes a surreal turn as they investigate Councilors’ Bluff, uncovering its dark secrets.</p>
<p>The adventure requires equal parts detective work, puzzle and trap solving, and action adventure to discover the truth behind the missing ones and the horrible fate that awaits those who fail to stop the rise of the cult of the Gobbler!</p>
<p>Available for the first time in print, this adventure classic is revised and re-edited to include brand new content for use with 5thEdition, Swords &amp; Wizardry, or Original Pathfinder!</p>
<p><br/>Includes several new monsters and variant monsters for use in your game!</p>

<h2>The Tiny Print Run</h2>
<h3>Why Indiegogo?</h3>
<p><a href=""https://froggodgames.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Frog God Games</a> is continuing the use of this indiegogo crowdfunding method for <i>Feast of the Gobbler.</i>  This method is almost the inverse of how we design our crowdfunding projects on Kickstarter. We call it the 'Tiny Print Run'.</p>
<p>Thus, Indiegogo projects by <a href=""https://froggodgames.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Frog God Games</a> will-</p>
<ul>
<li>Be short in duration</li>
<li>Be limited to a single title</li>
<li>Have options priced between $5-$30</li>
<li>Design all stretch goals and project bonus' affect the principle reward only (usually both the PDF and the softcover).</li>
<li>Be the only guaranteed method to get the premium* print copy (NOTE: the softcover versions  in this printing will not be sold on our website: see FAQ for explanation).</li>
<li>Have simple fulfillment process that does not use Backerkit</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>*Premium means 100 pound glossy interior pages with a thick, glossy cardstock cover. These are the nicest softcover books we have ever sold.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why the Tiny Print Run?</h3>
<p>Since 2012 our crowdfunding approach has been extravagant in every way. Ambitious with massive page counts, plus numerous add-on options and stretch goals. All supporting a primary title itself as many as 990 pages.</p>
<p>This has resulted in Kickstarter's with memorable pledge rewards that include top-quality hardcover books with sometimes dozens of stretch goal bonuses and add-on extras. These are awesome AND they are expensive to buy for customers like you because they are very expensive to make for publishers like us.</p>
<h3>Why not use Kickstarter?</h3>
<p>We will still be using Kickstarter, frequently, for our large-scale projects. These smaller projects are happening in response to the feedback we have heard from both fans and 'almost' fans alike. We hear the request for less expensive options for our projects and products all the time. A second frequent desire expressed to us, whether at conventions, on social media or in email, is for a larger selection of smaller, faster-paced adventures that can be completed in 2-3 sessions and not necessitate a full two year campaign.</p>
<p>Additionally, <a href=""https://froggodgames.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Frog God Games</a> has grown in both sales and brand awareness.  This opportunity will give us the additional resources to invest in the very best books in all of our formats. </p>

<h2>Project Reward</h2>
<p>With the wishes of the fans in mind, this and future Indiegogo projects will fund standalone projects that are both affordable and fun. This project, as well future Tiny Print Run projects, is narrowly focused with all stretch goals adding resources to the principle reward which traditionally would not be feasible for a publisher our size. </p>
<p>Examples of Enhancements from Higher Funding:</p>
<ul><li>During the 14 day primary project period for <i>Feast of the Gobbler</i> and after the $1000 goal is met the focus will be to improve the delivered product. There are no special tiered collectors editions or add-on purchase extras. Thus, as total project funding increases the better the final product will be for everybody.</li></ul>
<p>Examples of the planned extras that increased funding would bring to <i>Feast of the Gobbler:</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Additional commissions for interior color art specific to the adventure. </li>
<li>The previous Indiegogo project, Mystery at Ravenrock, added 2 interior art pieces and 3 extra creature illustrations for its appendix.</li>
<li>Printed Player map(s)/Insert. This is one we would love to do but it would require a substantial increase in overall project funding.</li>
<li>Downloadable Options designed for popular virtual table-top software (The rewards for both How Orcus Stole Christmas! and In Vino Gigantus included the new creature/NPC tokens and player maps). </li>
<li>High-resolution files of illustrations to share with players at the table.</li>

<h3>The 6ix and who makes it?</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>I'm Dakota Jernigan. I love making things, and growing things.</li>
<li>I want to get The 6ix : Battle-Boards in to the hands of people that like to play Dungeons and Dragons, Strategy games, Chess, Role-playing-games, and board-games in general, this campaign will share with you my project, some of the games mechanics, and why my friends and I think it's so fun to play.</li>
<li>With your contribution I can make more Original Boards and Pieces which take a lot of time, I will also be able to make Expansion Boards, Bosses and Boss Boards, and come up with further variations of The 6ix.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Fund me and receive a game</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>90% of the funding goes to paying me a small hourly income, because this is a Craft Board Game it takes several hours to create even one complete game, only 10% goes to the materials such as canvas, paint, clay, packaging.</li>
<li>If you contribute to this campaign you will receive one of the very first Hand-Crafted 'The 6ix : Battle-Boards' board-games, or a Hand-Sculpted Character Pawn for 'The 6ix', a Hand-Painted Tiny-Painting, and a Hand-Crafted Magnet.</li>
<li>If the campaign goal is not reached, the game will still get made, and played, so no worries. I'm starting here to get some pre-orders before the game is released on another platform such as Etsy.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What is The 6ix?</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>'The 6ix' is a resource crafting, turned-based combat game, where you and friends can: Battle each other in One vs One combat, Free-for-all, Team-Deathmatch, create new rules and items, make your own bosses, or even make your own characters and boards. Make a bow and arrow to range your rivals from afar. Smith a sword to slash through enemies. Or imbue a magical staff to send tricky projectiles toward unsuspecting opponents. And much more! </li>
<li>I know that people love playing this game, my friends and I have played it nearly one hundred times, testing out new rules and Items. I suggest you make the changes you see fit and don't be afraid to think outside the box.</li>
<li>The way the game works is you roll two six sided dice, and you take one action for each dice, be it : movement, collecting, crafting, cooking, using items, fishing, trading, attacking, or defending. Ones are low, Sixes are high. Doubles let you go again, but don't roll three doubles in a row, or pass the dice. There are 5 resources to collect from: Herbs, Logs, Ore, Fish, and Water. Turn them into powerful weapons, armor, and potions, and use strategy to out-smart your friends.</li>
<li>'The 6ix' is COMPLETELY Hand-made, every Character Pawn is unique, every board is unique. The boards are also tessellated, meaning, if you and friends have boards, you can connect them side by side and have a bigger board! Or connect even more. The boards are painted on cotton-canvas, using acrylic paint, and colored pencils. The Character Pawns are sculpted with Sculpey 3, oven baked, then Hand-painted. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>It is only me creating this board game and as of now I am a full time farmer. The biggest challenge for me would be if lots of people want 'The 6ix' I would either have to hire a helping hand, or put the production of the game into a manufacture's hands, losing it's hand-crafted appeal.</li>
<li>If I do have to hire a helper or  find other avenues for production it may delay the production of the game to get it to the players .</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Tell your friends about it, if your having finacial hardships right now as a lot of us are, maybe you can get a roommate or family member of yours to get the game so you can play too!</li>
<li>Please tell your friends about this game and share it on social media!</li>

A Spanish Galleon floats nearby, and you’ve talked your crewmates into working together to steal all of its treasure. What you haven’t told your fellow pirates is that you have no intentions on sharing the treasure once you have it. Your crewmates have told you that they share your loyalty and that they’ll help you maroon the greedy pirates on your ship to the rocky island of Tortuga. But you’ve seen your <i>friends</i>’ loaded pistols and heard their whisperings of a mutiny. You know that nobody can be trusted.</p><div>

<h1>TESTIMONIALS</h1>
<p><i>I don’t trust my friends anymore. But I love this game</i>. -Tessa</p>
<p><i>Tortuga is a game full of surprises! Each round brings with it new and intriguing events that ultimately make you the master of the sea or scum of Tortuga. It all depends on how proficient you are at finding your team and making that knowledge count.</i> -Alex R.</p>
<p><i>I have played this game basically every week for the last couple of months. I have loved it every single time and never been bored. It’s a great game to play with friends and really makes you think. -Abigail S</i></p>
<p><i>I love this game!!! No game is ever the same, and it's always exciting. You never know who is going to do what or if you are trusting the right person. Everyone I have introduced to this game has loved it too</i>. -Alex W.</p>
<p><i>Tortuga is a great social deduction game and it looks great on your game shelf too! Love the game even though sometimes it makes me question my friends and family</i>. -Brett A.</p>
<p><i>A game where I can deceive and be called Captain is a very good game indeed.</i>"" -Derek H.</p>
<p><i>Tortuga is unique in the fact that it allows the perfect amount of deception for those that enjoy tricking and deceiving others, but it also provides the opportunity to work off of pure logic and reason for the other players that do not particularly excel in manipulation. I have had the opportunity of playing this game numerous times with many different crowds, and every game is completely different because of the different strategies and techniques that people can utilize. </i>-Levi H.</p>

<h1> </h1>
<h1>TORTUGA CREATION PROCESS</h1>
<p>A great game (in our opinion), needs three things: solid mechanics, an awesome theme, and beautiful design.</p>
<p><b>1. Mechanics</b></p>
<p>Tortuga is all about the interactions you have with the other players. In some cases, such as when you and your shipmates are attacking the Spanish Galleon, you need to rely on your enemies in order to succeed. In the very next turn, however, your shipmates might stab you in the back with a mutiny in order to keep all the treasure for themselves.</p>
<p>Since nobody holds a ""hand"" of cards, this game is also about knowledge and communication regarding the community Event cards. Unless you are in desperation mode, it is not wise to reveal Event cards at random. Almost half of the Event cards can hurt your team drastically. It's often in your best interest to use an action to view the cards first, or to rely on the knowledge of a trusted ally. Knowing where harmful Event cards are located allows you to force an enemy to reveal those cards and suffer the consequences. The most successful players are the ones who are able to discern who is on their team and then share vital information with them at opportune moments.</p>
<p>Vote cards also play a key role in the game. Each Vote card has three sections - one each for Attacks, Mutinies, and Brawls. Players must put themselves in the best position to use their Vote cards, since their hand of Vote cards may not always be ideal based on their pawn location. For example, sometimes it may be worth putting in Water, causing an attack to fail, in order to save a Crossbones card for when you want to Mutiny against your captain.</p>
<div data-id=""15064671""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""A game in progress."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1488294716/ornfrxgonar5i8aifbbh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><figcaption>A game in progress.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p> </p>
<p><b>2. Theme</b></p>
<p>Tortuga, a small island off of Haiti, was an important pirate settlement and hideout during the golden age of piracy. British, French, and Dutch pirates lived together on the island in a loose alliance and formed a pirate government known as “The Brethren of the Coast.” Rich from its support of piracy and protected by the Brethren, Tortuga was full of taverns, gambling houses, and prostitutes.</p>
<p>The French and British governments, in an attempt to weaken the mighty Spanish, would often legalize piracy by giving pirates letters of marque. These gave pirates permission to unofficially plunder Spanish ships and towns. Many of the pirates on Tortuga chose the privateering life over full-blown piracy, which was illegal. Loyalty to country was fleeting, though, and pirates often walked the line between patriotism and rebellion.</p>
<p>Tortuga 1667 aims to capture the atmosphere of these loose alliances and shifting political loyalties.</p>
<div data-id=""15064680""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""All parts of the game were designed to bring the players into the canvas, wooden planks, and golden treasure world of the 1667 pirates!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1488294717/obsyguikjcmvkh5vx3rm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><figcaption><p>All parts of the game were designed to bring the players into the canvas, wooden planks, and golden treasure world of the 1667 pirates!</p></figcaption></figure></div>
<p><b>3. Design</b></p>
<p>The illustrations from Sarah Keele and graphic design from Holly Hancock take players deep into the world of privateers and pirate life. We used textures consistent to what pirates would see on an everyday basis: wooden planks and tables, canvas sails, and weather-torn maps.</p>
<p>All pieces of the game were carefully chosen for their color and aesthetic contributions to the theme. The burlap bag conjures images of a pirate's bag of possessions. Many of the cards use a canvas background like the sails on a ship. The playmat rolls out and looks just like an old treasure map. The faux book is worn and colored a piratey brown, dark maroon, and black.</p>

<h1> </h1>
<h1>STRETCH GOALS</h1>
<p>Because we reached the following milestones on Kickstarter, we will be adding 8 ""game-changer"" cards to every copy of the game! When setting up, players will add 3 of these game-changers into the Event deck. These cards have the potential to turn the tide in your team's favor! Cards will now also all be given a high-quality linen finish, 2 and 3-player setup rules will be added to the rulebook, a ""Captain's Helm"" illustration will be added to the blank Mutiny sections on the Vote cards, 2 ""double-vote"" Vote cards will be added to each copy of the game, a wooden explosion token will be added to each copy of the game, Brethren of the Coast cards will have player action lists on the back of them, the Treasure map will include a compass rose and map legend, and we're adding a Quick-Start/Certified First Edition card to every copy of the game!</p>

<div> </div>
<div>

</div></div>","WELCOME TO TORTUGA!The year is 1667 and you are a pirate sailing the waters of the Caribbean. A Spanish Galleon floats nearby, and you’ve talked your crewmates into working together to steal all of its treasure. What you haven’t told your fellow pirates is that you have no intentions on sharing the treasure once you have it. Your crewmates have told you that they share your loyalty and that they’ll help you maroon the greedy pirates on your ship to the rocky island of Tortuga. But you’ve seen your friends’ loaded pistols and heard their whisperings of a mutiny. You know that nobody can be trusted.
For 2-9 Players. 20-40 minutes. Ages 12+.



 GAME CONTENTS

1 Faux book container
1 Rulebook (includes character biographies)
75 Cards (9 Brethren of the Coast, 24 Event, 32 Vote, 9 Loyalty, 1 Quick-Start)
1 Rubber playing mat
1 Burlap pouch
9 Wooden pawns
8 Wooden treasure chests
1 Wooden explosion token

THE GAME
The game is packaged in a faux book box. The box has 3 magnets to keep it closed when you're moving it to and from game night.
 
The game fits nicely inside the faux book box. The box is big enough for cards to be sleeved, if desired.
 
The game board is a rubber playmat. The board rolls up like a map.
 
The 8 wooden treasure pieces come in a burlap bag.
 
Each of the 9 wooden pawns matches with 1 of the 9 pirates you can be in the game. Each pirate is based on a real pirate who roamed Tortuga and the Caribbean seas in the year 1667.
    
Each player has a secret loyalty: British, Dutch, or French. But be careful who you trust; someone claiming to share your loyalty may stab you in the back and steal your hard-earned treasure.
 
Use Event cards during the game to help your team get treasure, or to maroon members of the opposite team to the island of Tortuga.
 
Use Vote cards during the game to secretly impact Attacks against the Spanish, Mutinies against your Captain, and Brawls against your fellow pirates.

TESTIMONIALS
I don’t trust my friends anymore. But I love this game. -Tessa
Tortuga is a game full of surprises! Each round brings with it new and intriguing events that ultimately make you the master of the sea or scum of Tortuga. It all depends on how proficient you are at finding your team and making that knowledge count. -Alex R.
I have played this game basically every week for the last couple of months. I have loved it every single time and never been bored. It’s a great game to play with friends and really makes you think. -Abigail S
I love this game!!! No game is ever the same, and it's always exciting. You never know who is going to do what or if you are trusting the right person. Everyone I have introduced to this game has loved it too. -Alex W.
Tortuga is a great social deduction game and it looks great on your game shelf too! Love the game even though sometimes it makes me question my friends and family. -Brett A.
A game where I can deceive and be called Captain is a very good game indeed."" -Derek H.
Tortuga is unique in the fact that it allows the perfect amount of deception for those that enjoy tricking and deceiving others, but it also provides the opportunity to work off of pure logic and reason for the other players that do not particularly excel in manipulation. I have had the opportunity of playing this game numerous times with many different crowds, and every game is completely different because of the different strategies and techniques that people can utilize. -Levi H.

RULES OVERVIEW


Note: The video above gives a brief overview of the gameplay and rules. Complete rules, including tips & tricks, rule clarifications, advanced optional rules, event card descriptions, and character biographies are not shown in the video, but are all included in the game rulebook. If you'd like to look at the complete rules now please visit the links below:

Spanish 
Dutch
Italian
Portuguese
Hungarian
Turkish


Play the game as 1 of these 9 actual pirates from history. Biographies of each pirate are in the back of the rulebook.
 
Each player has a secret loyalty card. This is your team. Part of the game is deciphering who is your teammate and who is your enemy.
 
The Tortuga playing board. Teams win if they have the most treasure in their team's treasure holds when the Spanish Armada card is revealed.
 
Players choose to perform one action on their turn. One potential action is to reveal one of five available Event cards.
 
Be careful about which Event cards you reveal! Some may maroon you or your teammates to Tortuga.
 
If you reveal one of the three treasure maps, you must give it to someone you trust. If you reveal the Spanish Armada, the game is over.
 
During the game, Captains can call for Attacks, First Mates can call for Mutinies, and the Governor of Tortuga can call for Brawls. When one of these votes is called for, use your Vote cards to secretly cast your vote!
 
Depending on the player count, you'll need to rely more heavily on certain skills to win the game. We love the flexibility and variability of Tortuga 1667 based on the player count!
 
TORTUGA CREATION PROCESS
A great game (in our opinion), needs three things: solid mechanics, an awesome theme, and beautiful design.
1. Mechanics
Tortuga is all about the interactions you have with the other players. In some cases, such as when you and your shipmates are attacking the Spanish Galleon, you need to rely on your enemies in order to succeed. In the very next turn, however, your shipmates might stab you in the back with a mutiny in order to keep all the treasure for themselves.
Since nobody holds a ""hand"" of cards, this game is also about knowledge and communication regarding the community Event cards. Unless you are in desperation mode, it is not wise to reveal Event cards at random. Almost half of the Event cards can hurt your team drastically. It's often in your best interest to use an action to view the cards first, or to rely on the knowledge of a trusted ally. Knowing where harmful Event cards are located allows you to force an enemy to reveal those cards and suffer the consequences. The most successful players are the ones who are able to discern who is on their team and then share vital information with them at opportune moments.
Vote cards also play a key role in the game. Each Vote card has three sections - one each for Attacks, Mutinies, and Brawls. Players must put themselves in the best position to use their Vote cards, since their hand of Vote cards may not always be ideal based on their pawn location. For example, sometimes it may be worth putting in Water, causing an attack to fail, in order to save a Crossbones card for when you want to Mutiny against your captain.
A game in progress.
 
2. Theme
Tortuga, a small island off of Haiti, was an important pirate settlement and hideout during the golden age of piracy. British, French, and Dutch pirates lived together on the island in a loose alliance and formed a pirate government known as “The Brethren of the Coast.” Rich from its support of piracy and protected by the Brethren, Tortuga was full of taverns, gambling houses, and prostitutes.
The French and British governments, in an attempt to weaken the mighty Spanish, would often legalize piracy by giving pirates letters of marque. These gave pirates permission to unofficially plunder Spanish ships and towns. Many of the pirates on Tortuga chose the privateering life over full-blown piracy, which was illegal. Loyalty to country was fleeting, though, and pirates often walked the line between patriotism and rebellion.
Tortuga 1667 aims to capture the atmosphere of these loose alliances and shifting political loyalties.
All parts of the game were designed to bring the players into the canvas, wooden planks, and golden treasure world of the 1667 pirates!
3. Design
The illustrations from Sarah Keele and graphic design from Holly Hancock take players deep into the world of privateers and pirate life. We used textures consistent to what pirates would see on an everyday basis: wooden planks and tables, canvas sails, and weather-torn maps.
All pieces of the game were carefully chosen for their color and aesthetic contributions to the theme. The burlap bag conjures images of a pirate's bag of possessions. Many of the cards use a canvas background like the sails on a ship. The playmat rolls out and looks just like an old treasure map. The faux book is worn and colored a piratey brown, dark maroon, and black.
Some of Sarah's initial sketches and process for creating the beautiful illustrations in the game.

 
STRETCH GOALS
Because we reached the following milestones on Kickstarter, we will be adding 8 ""game-changer"" cards to every copy of the game! When setting up, players will add 3 of these game-changers into the Event deck. These cards have the potential to turn the tide in your team's favor! Cards will now also all be given a high-quality linen finish, 2 and 3-player setup rules will be added to the rulebook, a ""Captain's Helm"" illustration will be added to the blank Mutiny sections on the Vote cards, 2 ""double-vote"" Vote cards will be added to each copy of the game, a wooden explosion token will be added to each copy of the game, Brethren of the Coast cards will have player action lists on the back of them, the Treasure map will include a compass rose and map legend, and we're adding a Quick-Start/Certified First Edition card to every copy of the game!

PAST PROJECTS

In April 2015 we raised $103,000 on Kickstarter with our first game, Salem. This game takes players into the dark world of the Salem Witch Trials. Players must hunt down the witches before becoming one! The game has now sold over 10,000 copies and is played around the world. 
 
We are extremely proud to have delivered Salem on time to our backers! Here's what one of our backers had to say: 
 

I have backed over 46 projects and I just wanted to say this project has been an absolute delight to have been a backer for. Your updates have been insightful, but not overbearing. You clearly put a lot of time, thought, and effort into this game and it really shows. I was impressed with how fast this project came together. It was a fast, well organized campaign. Kudos to you and thank you for a wonderful end product. I couldn't be happier. -Snuffles00

Have a simple fulfillment process that does not use Backerkit
 Why the Tiny Print Run?Since 2012 our crowdfunding approach has been extravagant in every way. Ambitious with massive page counts, plus numerous add-on options and stretch goals. All supporting a primary title itself as many as 990 pages.This has resulted in Kickstarter's with memorable pledge rewards that include top-quality hardcover books with sometimes dozens of stretch goal bonuses and add-on extras. These are awesome AND they are expensive to buy for customers like you because they are very expensive to make for publishers like us.Why not use Kickstarter?We will still be using Kickstarter, frequently, for our large-scale projects, but we hear the request for less expensive options for our products all the time, especially smaller, faster-paced adventures that can be completed in 2-3 sessions. Product enhancements tied to project success During the funding period for Tome of Horrors Monster Cards and after the funding goal is met we will  improve the delivered product based on additional sales. There are no special tiered collectors editions or add-on purchase extras. Thus, as total project funding increases, the better the final product will be for everybody.Examples of improvements made to earlier products:
Downloadable Options designed for popular virtual table-top software (The rewards for both How Orcus Stole Christmas! and In Vino Gigantus included the new creature/NPC tokens and player maps). 
High-resolution files of illustrations to share with players at the table.
Project DeliveryPDF PerksWe will email the instructions to all eligible supporters with instructions on accessing the PDF items. The PDF files are distributed using our Constant Contact service, our web store, and Drive-thruRpg.com. You will need to have a customer account on the Necromancer Games website to access your PDF reward; You will need a One Book Shelf account (Drive-Thru Rpg, Drive-thru Cards etc.) to add the digital card files to your online library on their site.These methods allows us to keep track of everything. It also grants you unlimited access to your digital rewards on more than one platform's file library. The Indiegogo perk PDF files are 'purchased' at zero cost by supporters (as they are paid for during the Indiegogo promotion) at the Necromancer Games web store using a coupon code. That code we will be sent via Constant Contact to the address provided by Indiegogo. The Drive-Thru RPG fulfillment occurs after the webstore fulfillment. Both options are available to everyone.Please contact us with any questions/requests regarding the perk items and how you will get them after the project ends.Physical PerksPhysical perks will be mailed to the address provided by us via Indiegogo. All physical rewards are included the matching digital version at no additional charge. International Customers:

</div></div>","""Rüdiger Dorn (Istanbul, Karuba) makes incredibly smart and solid games and Montana is one of them"" - Richard Ham (Rahdo Runs Through)Halfway through the 19th century, the first permanent settlements appeared in Montana. After this, many fortune seekers traveled to this region with their caravans in search of work in order to build a better future for themselves. And there is an abundance of work. In the mountains, precious metals are to be found and in the fields a lot of manpower is required. Meanwhile, the number of settlements is growing and the demand for goods is rising. Recruit the right workers, deliver goods on time, and choose your settlements tactically. Only then you will have a chance of winning Montana.The first player to build all of their settlements wins!   (physical components of Montana) Make it deluxe!We have added some awesome upgrades to Montana that will enhance your experience with the game while making this Heritage Edition super deluxe!*remaining stock of exclusives is expected to be sold at conventions.  ...you'll do one of three actions:  A. Recruit
Spin the Recruitment Wheel.(that's right... A SPINNER!)After you receive your workers, you can pay grain to mitigate the wheel for more! For each grain paid, advance the spinner one space and hire the extra two workers. This gives you four workers total for that action.   B. WorkSend your workers to the bank, the mine, the quarry, the fields, or the farmland and pay the space's required money to receive the goods. You can choose to place an additional worker (or two workers of any color) to receive an extra good.The workers will occupy their spaces until all spaces in that region are filled. Once there are no spaces available, the workers will be dismissed to the main supply.Or you can send your contractor to the city to auction for extra goods or to upgrade your stone and copper.   C. BuildPay the goods indicated on the location you want to build and place one of your settlements there. You can build up to three settlements during this action.If you place a settlement that completes a line of four, you get to place an additional settlement on top of the settlement just placed.Additionally, if you build onto a location with a cow, you take the cow and place it on your player board. Cows can be used for cattle trade actions. If you are the first to build adjacent to a body of water, you take the canteen and place it on your player board. Canteens can be used to take an extra action, but only once.If you don't build three settlements on your turn, take a silver for each settlement not built, for a maximum of two silver.Building settlements is ultimately how you win the game. The first player to build all of their settlements is the winner of Montana! ...in addition to one of these actions, you can perform a cattle trade.This action allows you to trade in a cow (if you have one) for one good of your choice, three silver, or one worker of your choice. This can be done ANYTIME during your turn and AS MANY times as you want. Go cows! (physical components of Montana)  (for a more in depth look at The City, see rulebook below) Your player board is where everything is kept and also references game setup and player actions.

<p>Hey, y'all! It's Ryan &amp; Brad, the dudes from Craft Fair Games.</p>
<p>Last year we self-published our first official release, FEROX, and we were overwhelmed by the positive reception and support we received from the indie gaming and horror fan communities. </p>

<p>We're a fully-independent DIY publisher and every copy of every game we sell is handmade by the two of us in our kitchen for only enough profit to buy the beers we drink while we're doing it.

<h3>TRASH LORDS</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491882367/bm7so73dfxyga70gcaan.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Trash Lords is a push-your-luck, take-that, hand management game for 3-5 players. Each player takes on the role of one of 12 transient characters who stalk the back alleys and gutters, rifling through dumpsters in search of valuable trash.</p>
<p>Whether you’re a crust punk, a hobo rail-rider, a trust fund poseur, or Woody Guthrie’s actual ghost, all players have the same ultimate goal: rootin’ around in the trash til you’ve got the booze, smokes, snax, and dope you need to summon the TRASH LORD and be anointed his one true glorious Trash Child.</p>
<p>Each dumpster is different, and some more dangerous. Digging deeper can yield more rewards, but it’s also askin’ for trouble. This town is lousy with cops, and the nefarious garbage critters known as Trashlings are waiting in the shadows to swipe your beautiful junk. Even your fellow street urchins might just get wasted and jump you if your stash is lookin’ a little too tempting. Players must carefully manage their turns and constantly be on the move (and on their guard) as they booze, scrap, panhandle, and race to be the first to summon the TRASH LORD (peace be upon him).</p>

<h3>WHAT WE NEED</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Like any decent DIY anti-company, we believe in 100% transparency when it comes to handling your money. We need to raise $2000 to fund the material costs required to cover 70 copies of Ferox and 50 copies of Trash Lords. We picked those quantities because they allow for bulk discounts that make the games affordable enough for us to produce and worth it for you to buy. Our profit is very minimal, and we can absolutely assure you that every cent of it will be spent on the beer and notebook paper we need to design more games. We literally don't know what else money is for.</p>

As soon as the materials arrive at our doorstep, we'll get to work assembling copies. It's a time-intensive process, and as soon as we're set free from our full-time ""day jobs"" we'll be spending every second of our time filling order as quickly as we possibly can. We'll be shipping out everyone's perks in the order in which you backed the project, and we'll post regular updates for backers so you can monitor our progress.

<h2>Welcome to Queeng Playing Cards</h2>
<p><strong>Update as of January 26, 2021: </strong>We have just launched our new 2nd edition of Queeng, the Diverse edition with multi-ethnic face cards! To learn more and back our mission, see our new campaign: <strong><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/queeng-playing-cards-2nd-edition/x/5904646?create_edit=true#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/queeng-playing-cards-2nd-edition/x/5904646?create_edit=true#/</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Update as of November 2020: </strong>We have printed 5,000 more decks with a new, high quality printing company (Liberty Cards) in order to get you more Queeng cards before the holidays! Order ASAP to ensure delivery before Christmas.</p>
<h2>Our Story<strong>  </strong>
</h2>
<p><strong>Queeng </strong><strong>P</strong><strong>laying​ Cards </strong>is a family project that my father and I started on a family vacation 3 years ago. </p>
<p>It all started with an innocent question when we were playing a card game together...</p>
<p>I asked</p>
<p><i><u>“Why is the King always worth more than the Queen?</u>”</i></p>
<p>He didn’t really have a good answer. So he encouraged me to find a solution!</p>
<p>After some brainstorming, we decided to create an updated version of the classic deck of cards. </p>
<p>Aside from making a wise statement about equality and how far we've come, my father realized it would be a GREAT opportunity to teach me about business challenges, product design, and marketing. By working with him, we got the chance to bond on an entirely different level.</p>
<p>I got to discover a whole other side of my dad, while getting some hands-on entrepreneurial experience. Or as my Dad put it, our project got me 'closer to the real world'—by learning about things like trial and error, time management, and patience.</p>
<p>Since my dad is the CEO of a media company, he has a pretty good sense of what a product launch involves. But he totally encouraged me to take the lead. <span>I had the freedom and authority to call the shots—and make mistakes—on my own.</span></p>
<p>One decision  I made was that I didn't want to be front and center of our campaign. I'm pretty camera shy. So we got a great actress to play me and tell our story. </p>
<p>Because the amazing thing is, we actually turned our idea into a unique product that WORKS!!</p>
<p><strong>Queeng</strong> is an updated version of the classic deck of playing cards, but still works with ALL the original principles, so you can play ANY card game with it. </p>
<p>With its attention to detail and gorgeous, hand-drawn illustrations, each deck as special as the encouraging message it's bringing the world ❤</p>

Free Box Packaging for every set of 3 packs.Scenario Cards will be available at our discounted rates, until our website launches in July. Hate spending $1000 on a life-coach to find your purpose? So do we. That’s why we created Scenario Cards.Each card comes with one ‘What if…’ scenario.‘What if…’ scenarios are powerful mental models used by psychologists to help you let go of your worries, fears and insecurities about the opinion of others.

All scenarios were inspired by 12 topics, centered around you, your life and the world you live in. The topics are color-coded to make it easy to navigate between them.Every card comes with one scenario, within one topic and one degree of intensity. Do you fancy mild, medium, spicy, or extremely spicy?With these cards, you don’t have to meet with a life-coach to find your purpose. You can use the scenarios for mini-coaching sessions to discover what you really want to know about yourself and your friends.

 
To uncover your purpose one must follow three steps. Hence we designed three packs.Pack 1: Your self - Look inward to get to know yourself better. 
Pack 2: Your life - Reflect on your life up to this point and set intentions for the time to come

Pack 3: Your world - Look out into your world and plan the new adventures you want to take on.With all three packs at hand you have a set of cards for every occasion, whether you are with your friends, family, your partner or your co-workers. We have spent a lot of time designing our cards into something truly beautiful and which invites for deep reflection.Pastel colors trigger you to get excited to set aside your fear of judgement and discover what is true for you, right now, in this moment. 6 uniquely designed dreaming faces represent the curiosity we all should have to explore how the people around us see the world, no matter their gender or ethnicity.When designs were ready, we made a selection of the 156 most powerful scenarios from a portfolio of over 4000 options together with a team of psychologists.The result is a set of 156 beautifully designed scenario cards, which help you guide your self-reflection and trigger great conversations with people that you care about.Scenario Cards are currently in production and will be shipped at the end of February.

<p>Our previous project on <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1178384921/devils-run-roleplaying-game-2d20-and-savage-worlds"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kickstarter</a> has already funded the Devil's Run Roleplaying Game core book: a lavish hardcover rulebook of approximately 320 pages that will empower both GMs and players alike with the ability to explore this post-apocalyptic setting in more detail than ever before. Pledging here will not only net you the relevant rewards for your chosen perk, but will also increase the overall funding goal to help unlock even more potential for both the setting and RPG! We are currently heading towards a 5e compatible variant of the core book.</p>
<p>The Devil's Run RPG core book will utilise the popular 2d20 ruleset - a lightweight system that seeks to seamlessly integrate story and action whilst keeping the game focussed on the players. The core book will not only greatly expand upon the factions that have already been introduced by the board games, but will also introduce several new ones. It will also delve further into the history of the setting, from the very Day of the Apocalypse to its current timeline, some twenty years later. Global affairs will also be explored, including a closer look at the new super powers that contend on the world stage.</p>

We have introduced a new range of 20mm miniatures that can be used for either the RPG or board game. The RPG core book and any additional supplements funded will include sample board game stats for notable npcs, which means that play can easily flow between the two mediums - should you wish it to, of course.</p>
<p>Please note, however, that there is absolutely no need to pick up either the miniatures or the board game in order to enjoy the wild and explosive mayhem of the Devil's Run RPG! As a pen-and-paper game of post-apocalyptic storytelling, the RPG can be used to provide endless entertainment all on its own.</p>
<p>That's not all, however! As an added boost to the Devil's Run RPG, we will be providing dual support for both the 2d20 and Savage Worlds system. This means that NPCs will be provisioned with stats for both 2d20 and Savage Worlds, while full rules will be provided for faction-specific career packages and exciting new Edges that focus on vehicular carnage. Additionally, we will be exploring the provision of vehicles as Extras, which will allow for them to be developed and grow with the characters in a more dynamic form as the campaign develops.</p>

<p>In the world of the Devil's Run, a Cold War that had never thawed exploded into a nuclear exchange that forever altered the global stage and plunged the world into chaos. Russia and much of China disappeared in the wake of the first strike launched by the United States, but their retaliatory bombardments razed the East Coast and most of the central states. Spared widescale nuclear devastation, the population centres of the West Coast were instead subjected to the horrors of the Revenant Virus: a deadly and virulent chemical that creates rage-fuelled zombies out of the living.</p>
<p>Blind luck or the hand of the devil himself saved San Francisco from a fate worse than death on the Day of the Apocalypse. Although the city suffered its own wounds as a result of that tumultuous day, it rapidly became a haven for any survivors that could survive the journey to the so-called 'safe zone'. In the twenty years since, new factions that have risen from the ashes of the Old World have turned San Fran's streets into a hotly contested warzone as each vies for domination over the others.</p>
<p>To meet the initial humanitarian obligations that they set themselves, the other countries of the world continue to send aid packages north of the Mexican border that defines the Quarantine Zone. It is these air drops that most often send the factions into a frenzy of roaring engines and blazing guns as they seek to once again claim the prize of the Devil's Run.</p>
<p>If you're a fan of George Miller movies and shows such as the Walking Dead, then you're sure to love everything the Devil's Run RPG has to offer! Although the Revenants from those first days following the Day of the Apocalypse have long since turned to dust, the virus itself still poses a deadly risk, and that is something that we very much intend to explore with the introduction of factions such as the Los Nigromantes, amongst others.</p>

<h1><span>We only know how to develop one kind of game: THE BEST</span></h1>
<p>It seems like an eternity to us but not so long ago (November 2017), we released <span>The Enigma Box, </span>an original and successful game that was a watershed in the market. The game combined the latest technology with research plots, mysteries and adventures, in a style similar to the pure concept of <span>escape room</span>.</p>
<div data-id=""28909846""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1592407013/gwppcnbkkqabss4vxhnr.png"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p>Although the results of this first initiative were magnificent, we didn’t settle, because for us the only thing valuable is excellence. So we asked (a lot) and listened (much more) to our <span>backers, </span>fans and other people who tried <span>The Enigma Box,</span> who told us about their experiences, their proposals for improvement of the shape and background, and in short, any other matters that could help us continue to grow as a company and offer the best products possible. We had the opportunity to meet some of these individuals in person in <span>Essen (at Spiel)</span>, and many others got in touch through various communication channels, but the conclusions were the same: great gaming satisfaction and hundreds of ideas to grow and improve. Thanks to the feedback, we have perfected our processes of design, production, logistics and even the gaming experience itself. We lack the words to thank our followers for everything they have shared with us.</p>
<div data-id=""28909851""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1592407013/rmn7kvvmowg7soatdcui.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p>Our games have been tested, not only by our backers, but also by multiple fans of Team Building activities and Escape Rooms where our unique gaming system was used. More than 700 companies have passed through our experiences, and we have helped more than 1,100 teams to communicate, have fun and grow together. Among others, these companies include Coca-Cola, Leroy, GE, DKV, DHL, Mars, Oracle, Microsoft, Telefonica and Ikea.</p>
<p>The whole team has worked intensely and uninterruptedly to create this great product, innovative and entertaining, offering people an opportunity to experience the new and undiscovered; awakening their intuitions and developing new skills such as reflection and dexterity; increasing their understanding of the world and improving their general knowledge; and helping them dream of new opportunities in an infinite world of possibilities.</p>
<p>We are a team of professional experts in graphic adventures, challenges and logical game design, with more than 20 years of experience and international recognition in products based on new technologies. This combination of people, multidisciplinary experience and training together with market knowledge places <span>The</span> <span>Enigma Box</span> vol.1 ® in an unbeatable position to become The Next <span>Big Thing</span> in entertainment systems. Exclusive on Kickstarter!</p>
<p>We have designed all the documents, pieces of art and riddles. We have also developed 3D and augmented reality technology for fully interactable virtual reality objects.

<p>Until today, The Rhomb ® membership was carefully curated for specific functions and objectives. Our members come from different countries, cultures, and backgrounds, including universities, exclusive clubs, or investigation centers. We always rely on the latest technology and advances in historical research to discover events that were left unresolved and unexplained.</p>

<p>This project was launched with the support of teams from London and Madrid. We have been receiving help and guidance from expert historians, as well as explorers, high-caliber designers, engineers, technologists, and scientists. We have relied on international investment companies to back the project and guarantee its success.</p>
<p>At The Rhomb ®, we have a passion for a job well done. We take pride in our finished products and aspire to the highest standards of quality, having attended meticulously to the smallest details. Each piece is a carefully designed and crafted component of the box and is presented as a work of art. All parts of the Enigma Box come together to create a masterpiece, an object that should be displayed in a museum, which is precisely what we did with The Enigma Box ®.</p>
<p>We are experts in adventures, challenges, and designing logic games. Our team has years of experience in graphic arts and includes international leaders in designing new technology. We depend on respected historians who have unveiled new tests, documents, and amazing discoveries that have not yet been made public. This combination of people and resources makes Enigma Box (vol. 1) ® a unique experience available exclusively via Kickstarter. We believe this will be the next big thing in entertainment and our goal is to make this project one of the most amazing campaigns ever launched on this platform.</p>
<h1> <span>Will you help us create this challenge?</span><br/><span>Will you be a part of history?</span> </h1>
<p>Risks and challenges</p>
<p>We have already carried out a Kickstarter campaign in the past that we delivered successfully, and that experience helped us understand better the whole process of product creation, manufacturing and shipping logistics. We were aware of all possible risks while creating a new product, so you can be sure that our project has been undertaken by professionals who did their best to keep it free from mistakes. We have extensive experience in launching games, Escape Rooms, puzzles and also in the management of new technologies. There is a risk that we will have to implement some modifications during manufacturing, and this might happen mainly due to the following reasons: ● Creativity: When using some original documents and historical elements from the public domain, it may occur that for copyright reasons we have to change some creativity. ● Sizes, formats and qualities: We already have found several suppliers of the materials, as seen in the prototypes. We have agreed on sizes and qualities, but there is a risk that during the mass production process some formats might need to be slightly modified due to the manufacturing process. We will do our best to keep everything under control and to make sure that the final product will not be significantly affected.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: Our experience tells us that we will need around 3-4 months to finalize the production. We believe we will be able to deliver on time for Christmas 2020, but we can't commit 100% as we rely on more than seven different providers so some delays may occur. It will also depend on the pace of production as well as the freight companies. But we'll do everything we can to deliver on time.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: Intellectual property and copyright In the research, design, development and production of Enigma Box, we have made use of different elements, images and historical documents. We have maintained maximum rigor, ensuring that all elements are in the public domain. We have acquired the rights to certain images and visuals, as well as ensured that the copyrights of the elements used have expired. Challenges The hardest part is done, however, as plans and materials are ready for mass production. Our products have a variety of materials and objects and should any not be available when production begins, be it due to lack of stock or discontinuation, it will be replaced with a similar item. By pledging on this Kickstarter you acknowledge that the final look and contents of the pledges may change and differ from what is presented at the start of the campaign.</p>
<p>We have estimated the delivery for Oct 2020 but please understand this is only an estimate. Due to the global logistics involved in shipping, some regions may receive their pledges sooner than others. We are prepared with our production as much as possible, however we will refund pledges if for some unforeseen reason the game cannot be delivered at all. We will be unable to refund the charges incurred by Kickstarter and Pledge Manager or other charges for your payment (PayPal, VISA, credit card...). This represents approximately 15% of the full payment. We will be unable to refund you the charges incurred by Kickstarter and Pledge Manager or other charges for your payment (PayPal, VISA, credit card...).</p>
<p>This represents approximately 15% of the full payment. This project is being funded in EUROS and any refunds will be also processed in EUROS. Terms and Conditions We’ve been consulting our manufacturer and shipping company about reducing the box's weight to keep the shipping costs down. In order to make sure that these costs are as low as possible we will be charging shipping after the campaign ends. Backers will gain access to our Pledge Manager by email roughly one-two months after this campaigns completion.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to customs regulations, we are not able to ship to Afghanistan, Ukraine or Kazakhstan. You agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information, and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret that we are unable to ship to PO Boxes. If you do not accept the proposed terms please do not pledge on this Kickstarter project and wait for the global general release</p>

 Check out some videos and reviews from our previous game “The Enigma Box.""



 

 

We are offering you a radical game experience unlike any you’ve played before as you undertake this adventure from your own home. We have created an incredible story based on real events, with a gripping atmosphere, the most astonishing riddles, the most advanced technology, and the potential to go down in history.

Although you can play alone, your journey will be more enjoyable if you are accompanied by friends, as you can work together, help each other when you get stuck, share different perspectives and discover clues that you may have missed.



The clues and riddles contained in the box, along with the virtual worlds you can access using your computer or smartphone, will help you find coordinates and keywords to progress through the adventure. The provided booklet will guide you through each location in the world so you know exactly what to look for and which enigmas may be involved. However, not every detail is important. You will need to find the exact combinations of objects, riddles and information to solve the mystery.
Once you have all the numbers for a coordinate, you must enter them using the app or your computer. This will unlock a new spot in the world that you must investigate using virtual reality, counting on new content made available via augmented reality.

Your next objective is to find the place in the world that will unlock the next clue, using the 360º VR content and the riddles in the box. You must traverse the most mysterious places on the planet until you reach your final goal and discover just what the Arcanum Arcanorum really is.
The Enigma Box (vol. 1) instructions, booklet and welcome pack are written in English, German, Spanish and French and contain everything you’ll need to complete the adventure. The game relies mostly on visuals, rather than words, although some riddles and puzzles will have a few words in English only.


New technological trends have heralded great changes in the world around us and have opened up new possibilities for investigation techniques and video games. We embrace these developments to create a truly immersive adventure unlike any you’ve seen before.
We have fully incorporated VR technology and AR technology into the game. Enigma Box ""Arcanum"" uses an array of technology:



We only know how to develop one kind of game: THE BEST
It seems like an eternity to us but not so long ago (November 2017), we released The Enigma Box, an original and successful game that was a watershed in the market. The game combined the latest technology with research plots, mysteries and adventures, in a style similar to the pure concept of escape room.

Although the results of this first initiative were magnificent, we didn’t settle, because for us the only thing valuable is excellence. So we asked (a lot) and listened (much more) to our backers, fans and other people who tried The Enigma Box, who told us about their experiences, their proposals for improvement of the shape and background, and in short, any other matters that could help us continue to grow as a company and offer the best products possible. We had the opportunity to meet some of these individuals in person in Essen (at Spiel), and many others got in touch through various communication channels, but the conclusions were the same: great gaming satisfaction and hundreds of ideas to grow and improve. Thanks to the feedback, we have perfected our processes of design, production, logistics and even the gaming experience itself. We lack the words to thank our followers for everything they have shared with us.

Our games have been tested, not only by our backers, but also by multiple fans of Team Building activities and Escape Rooms where our unique gaming system was used. More than 700 companies have passed through our experiences, and we have helped more than 1,100 teams to communicate, have fun and grow together. Among others, these companies include Coca-Cola, Leroy, GE, DKV, DHL, Mars, Oracle, Microsoft, Telefonica and Ikea.
The whole team has worked intensely and uninterruptedly to create this great product, innovative and entertaining, offering people an opportunity to experience the new and undiscovered; awakening their intuitions and developing new skills such as reflection and dexterity; increasing their understanding of the world and improving their general knowledge; and helping them dream of new opportunities in an infinite world of possibilities.
We are a team of professional experts in graphic adventures, challenges and logical game design, with more than 20 years of experience and international recognition in products based on new technologies. This combination of people, multidisciplinary experience and training together with market knowledge places The Enigma Box vol.1 ® in an unbeatable position to become The Next Big Thing in entertainment systems. Exclusive on Kickstarter!
We have designed all the documents, pieces of art and riddles. We have also developed 3D and augmented reality technology for fully interactable virtual reality objects. We have closed a deal with different manufacturers and providers outlining the start of production with moulds and templates. We plan to make first deliveries to our customers in Oct 2020 (Estimated).
As you can see from the videos and images, we have a box: “Enigma Box” vol.1 ®, which is fully functional. We have designed all the documents, pieces of art and riddles. Production of the box is not a problem, in addition to the money accumulated from Kickstarter, we can count on access to various venture capital funds to allow us to create an even higher quality experience.

The box will be limited to this campaign and we plan to offer additional purchases in the next months at a 20% premium on the initial campaign offer. This guarantees that the adventure and the objects of the box remain exclusive for a long period of time. 
We only have to produce and create the number of units which this launch will gather. We plan to make first deliveries to our customer in Oct 2020.

 We would like to present to you our new adventure, Enigma Box (vol. 1), which brings back the experiences, games, and enigmas from our previous campaign “The Enigma Box” but in a new format that is compact and affordable.
Why have we made these changes? We wanted to share the Enigma Box gaming experience with as many people as possible, so we reduced the game’s price and duration (there are now only 5 complete scenarios) while maintaining the original version’s intensity, excitement, technological features and mysteries.

Risks and challenges
We have already carried out a Kickstarter campaign in the past that we delivered successfully, and that experience helped us understand better the whole process of product creation, manufacturing and shipping logistics. We were aware of all possible risks while creating a new product, so you can be sure that our project has been undertaken by professionals who did their best to keep it free from mistakes. We have extensive experience in launching games, Escape Rooms, puzzles and also in the management of new technologies. There is a risk that we will have to implement some modifications during manufacturing, and this might happen mainly due to the following reasons: ● Creativity: When using some original documents and historical elements from the public domain, it may occur that for copyright reasons we have to change some creativity. ● Sizes, formats and qualities: We already have found several suppliers of the materials, as seen in the prototypes. We have agreed on sizes and qualities, but there is a risk that during the mass production process some formats might need to be slightly modified due to the manufacturing process. We will do our best to keep everything under control and to make sure that the final product will not be significantly affected.
 
IMPORTANT NOTE: Our experience tells us that we will need around 3-4 months to finalize the production. We believe we will be able to deliver on time for Christmas 2020, but we can't commit 100% as we rely on more than seven different providers so some delays may occur. It will also depend on the pace of production as well as the freight companies. But we'll do everything we can to deliver on time.
IMPORTANT: Intellectual property and copyright In the research, design, development and production of Enigma Box, we have made use of different elements, images and historical documents. We have maintained maximum rigor, ensuring that all elements are in the public domain.

In total over 30 tokens will be added to the adventures.All maps come in four different versions: Gridless (perfect for online gaming), square grid, hexagon grid, and printer-friendly black and white versions.

I can’t wait to dive into reading the adventure. Thanks for the great work you’ve done. Just a quick scroll through and the quality looks great!’     — Joshua D Garcia (Superbacker)‘Wow, I quickly skimmed the contents after downloading and I’m so happy with it! I can’t wait to find a group to run this for. For the price, it’s such a great value and you really went above and beyond.’     — Karen Petrasko (backer)'Rise of the Ice Dragons is a wonderful adventure that provides a lot of different parts that are entertaining for every kind of player and group. The story is easy to follow and to prepare for DM’s. It includes a bunch of interesting encounters, monsters and NPC’s and still is open enough to add your own things to it.The maps are nicely drawn and are always an eye-catcher at the table.And the best part is that the players actually get to see dragons in game!'    — Hoard Of Tales, D&D5e Actualplay Livestream          https://www.twitch.tv/hoardoftales (@hoard_of_tales)‘The quality of the illustrations are no exception and blend perfectly with the style of this work. Some images may even make you want to reuse them for other campaigns, as well. I have been glad to discover that the aesthetics of Rise of the Ice Dragons Trilogy are simply gorgeous. The first thing you notice is a sturdy, hard cover protecting the volume, providing the usual and necessary basic information about the work itself. The pages inside are thick, with a pleasant feel; their color is similar to that of parchment, but without impeding legibility.’     — Andy Lingua (No Dice Unrolled)         Rise of the Ice Dragons Trilogy Review To ensure that backers pay the lowest price possible, additional costs for printing and shipping charged by DriveThruRPG are not included in hardcover and softcover pledge rewards.Additional estimated cost for physical books:Softcover book: $17Hardcover book: $22Estimated shipping cost examples:US: $5 ⎜ UK: $6  ⎜ Germany: $8 ⎜ France: $9  ⎜ Australia: $12There are no additional printing or shipping costs for digital rewards.Explorer (Low Income)Digital Copy - Pledge £5You get the same reward and products as the £10 Adventurer Tier.This is the option for anyone who doesn’t have that much money.

The adventures have already been written and playtested. We’re collaborating with DriveThruRPG for the printed versions of the book. We’ve partnered with them before and are really happy with the results – the books look great!We’ve learned to always add extra time to our schedule, and so far all of our projects have been fully delivered. Having said that, sometimes there have been a few delays due to unforeseen circumstances. (For example: An untimely broken wrist, the coronavirus pandemic, Brexit, a freakish snowstorm in Spain…we have seen and weathered it all.)Thank you for considering backing Midnight Tower’s Epic Campaign! :)",36.0,0,"1 Campaign
