</div><p>Paul Olliges applied more than 2 decades of equipment design experience to create the <strong>world's first Pressure Active Therapy (PAT) machine</strong>. <strong> It's called BackAlive</strong> and helps relieve back pain at home.  It's like having an alternative to a chiropractor right in your house and it's easy to use.</p><div>

</div><p>The inventor and founder, Marty Abercrombie had suffered through back treatments of all sorts and tried every treatment he could find including surgery.  Nothing provided sustained relief.  That led to the invention of BackAlive and after 3 decades of continuous attention to pain, Marty now has increased mobility and a more pain-free life.  His journey motivates him to bring this opportunity to back pain sufferers because he understands the impact to their life.</p><div>
</div><p>Back pain can be debilitating and lead to a major change in a person's life.  Although there are numerous medical and non-medical treatments, a powerful, easy-to-use, at-home machine has been elusive-until now, until BackAlive.</p><div>
</div><p>It’s easy to use.  You don’t need to be on the floor.  You don’t need to turn upside down or act like a monkey.  You don't need to get in any unfamiliar or uncomfortable position.  It's not inversion, and doesn't have any concerns that  inversion has, and it really works.  </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442549095/vhfxb05a1oxj3npjpxgg.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div>
""Ahhh"" - that's the most common sound people make when they first experience a BackAlive machine.  It's the world's first easy-to-use back pain relief machine.  The amazing benefits of this simple movement unveil the deep genius behind the concept.  Just slide onto the seat area, grab the grips, place your feet in the foot rests,  and work your back on the split-roller technology.</div><div>
</div><p></p><div>
</div><p><strong>Like a massage, you will have increased blood flow, relaxation of the spinal column, an opportunity for decompression, nerve relaxation, and the opportunity for removal of muscle stress allowing improved spinal alignment.</strong>   </p><div>

</div><p>For the last 5 years we have been improving the machine and are now prepared to market the new BackAlive to a broader audience.  It's adjustable features allow people of all sizes to get immediate benefits and everyone to work all areas of their back.  But allowing people of different heights to use the machine isn't all we learned.  We also learned that once people try it - they want one in their home - immediately.  </p><div>
</div><p>The best part is, no matter where the pain is, BackAlive can help.  You can  work very low on your back and all the way up to your neck and back of your  head.  There are even more advanced techniques for other areas of your body.  It's a full range machine.</p><div>
</div><p>Unlike exercise equipment, you will have a long-term desire to use this machine regularly,  In fact, most people like to use it daily.  It's self-motivating and a deeply fulfilling activity because it relieves pain, and that makes it an excellent investment.</p><div>
</div><p>This is a great opportunity for you to have a deep discount from the targeted retail price.  We want you to take advantage of this opportunity, but also help us bring the machine to the millions of people suffering every day who can't have a daily treatment.  Now they can have a very serious and powerful option right from their home - BackAlive!</p><div>

It’s easy to use.  You don’t need to be on the floor.  You don’t need to turn upside down or act like a monkey.  You don't need to get in any unfamiliar or uncomfortable position.  It's not inversion, and doesn't have any concerns that  inversion has, and it really works.  
""Ahhh"" - that's the most common sound people make when they first experience a BackAlive machine.  It's the world's first easy-to-use back pain relief machine.  The amazing benefits of this simple movement unveil the deep genius behind the concept.  Just slide onto the seat area, grab the grips, place your feet in the foot rests,  and work your back on the split-roller technology.

Like a massage, you will have increased blood flow, relaxation of the spinal column, an opportunity for decompression, nerve relaxation, and the opportunity for removal of muscle stress allowing improved spinal alignment.   



For the last 5 years we have been improving the machine and are now prepared to market the new BackAlive to a broader audience.  It's adjustable features allow people of all sizes to get immediate benefits and everyone to work all areas of their back.  But allowing people of different heights to use the machine isn't all we learned.  We also learned that once people try it - they want one in their home - immediately.  
The best part is, no matter where the pain is, BackAlive can help.  You can  work very low on your back and all the way up to your neck and back of your  head.  There are even more advanced techniques for other areas of your body.  It's a full range machine.
Unlike exercise equipment, you will have a long-term desire to use this machine regularly,  In fact, most people like to use it daily.  It's self-motivating and a deeply fulfilling activity because it relieves pain, and that makes it an excellent investment.
This is a great opportunity for you to have a deep discount from the targeted retail price.  We want you to take advantage of this opportunity, but also help us bring the machine to the millions of people suffering every day who can't have a daily treatment.  Now they can have a very serious and powerful option right from their home - BackAlive!
             Just roll into place                                   Unfold

 
Adjust to your area of need                  Attain relief from pain

<p><b>Question 1: ""Why was YANG-Natural-Balm developed?""</b></p>
<p>Answer: ""The effect of conventional ointments against
articulation, muscle and tendon pains are almost exclusively based on the
chemical industrially produced materials Ibuprofen and Diclofenac with all
their well-known side effects on the overall organism, particularly with longer
using. In top of this comes a heavy strain on the skin.</p>
<p>Within the scope of a symposium on alternative therapeutical
possibilities in the particular field, orthopedists and doctors of sports medicine
decided to produce a specific, especially adjusted, hypoallergenic
(non-irritant) ointment with less side effects.“</p>
<p><b>Question 2: ""Why was Yang-Natural-Balm developed on base of the
Traditional Chinese Medicine?“</b></p>
<p>Answer: ""The participating doctors followed the aim of an
innovative natural product using medicinal herbs with known effects in a
grooming,well absorbing ointment base for a long-term treatment without
problems.</p>
<p>The TCM can look back on an experience of thousands of years
with those agents, but has confined itself 
to the so-called 'dekokte', a mush of these healing herbs for extern
application. The firm 'aesculapius-RMD ltd. has now brought this medicinal herb
mixture into a balm specially developped by the cosmetics research.“</p>
<p><b>Question 3: ""Is Yang-Natural-Balm really a clean natural
product?“</b></p>
<p>Answer: ""Yang is a clean product of herbs, although the herb
agents are dissolved in ethyl alcohol (subjected to the state control for
spirits). In order to reduce the specific smell of the herbs, natural orange
oil was added. This ointment doesn't contain any animal products, especially no
additives from pigs ( which are added to cosmetical ointments with collagen).
That is why this product was certifizised as a HALAL product after a detailed
examination in 2010.“</p>
<p><b>Question 4: ""How safe are the herbs imported from China
concerning impurities?“</b></p>
<p>Answer: ""Only few, especially licensed companies are allowed to
import Chinese herbs to Germany. We work together with China-Medica, a
recognised TCM specialist. Every single medicinal herb can be traced back
documentedly to its place of origin. After their arrival in Germany all these
herbs are examined on impurities, pesticides, heavy metals by a likewise
licensed institute. With the evidence of one of these substances the imported goods
must be deleted.“</p>
<p><b>Question 5: ""How is Yang-Natural-Balm legally rated?“</b></p>
<p>Answer: ""Y.N.B. was examined by the laboratory PHYTOS, analytics
of medicaments ltd., Neu-Ulm, and got the registration (license) as a medicine
product.""</p>
<p><b>Question 6: ""How well-tolerated is Y.N.B. with long-time
application?“</b></p>
<p>Answer: ""As a matter of principle, nobody can completely exclude
side effects dealing with materials of any kind. Y.N.B. was tested on allergies
by the firm DERMATEST over a long period of time and no test person showed any
reaction of incompatibility. The assessment was very good. Other side effects
haven't occurred so far.""</p>
<p><b>Question 7: “How long is the shelf life of Y.N.B.? How is its
conduct towards germs (bacteriums and fungus)?“</b></p>
<p>Answer: ""As it is an innovative product, there weren't any
progress reports in the beginning. On the basis of its composition and its
ingredients we assumed a minimum shelf life of one year. At the same time the
ointment was tested on its conduct by a microbiological institute in regular
periods. At the moment we have as a result the durability of at least three
years, whereas Y.N.B. still has been sterile even after this time. An
additional incubation with bacteriums and fungus was able to prove that these
germs were killed by the ointment, i.e. it is bactericidal and fungicidal.
These results provide  good conditions
for the treatment of wounds. Tests on the matter are already on the way.""  </p>
<p><b>Question 8: “Is there an extension of the Y.N.B. range planned for
the future? Are there any progress reports by patients using the ointment on
not yet known effects of the balm?“</b></p>
<p>Answer: ""In the scope of application we have got a lot of reports
about additional effects from the patients. These statements are naturally
examined. Reports on the application on feet have been obvious regarding  the precaution against pain, formation of
callus and smelly feet as well as the prevention of overboarding forming of
scarves after injuries and better healing of diabetic ulcers. For these
indications Y.N.B. will be specially adapted in a prevailing variation in its
composition.“</p>
<p><b>Question 9: ""How do you explain the comparatively expensive selling
price of Y.N.B.?“</b></p>
<p>Answer: ""Independently of the financially expensive development,
it is because of the high production costs, as there must be made great demands
on natural products for the sake of the patients. Apart from the conventional
carrying out of legally stipulated instructions, we have imposed ourselves more
safety tests within the production in order to keep the high production
standard. The production process maintains a hundreds of years old tradition.“</p>

camp, Everybody's favorite activity is River Day, where we gather together in
canoes, kayaks, and rafts. This is a unique experience for staff and campers alike,
where everyone gets to paddle, navigate “rapids”, play games, interact with
friends, and enjoying the peacefulness of our surroundings; right in the middle
of a metropolitan city. Campers practice what they have been learning all week:
Interacting, Relating, and communicating in an organic setting. We need more
rafts to make this summer’s river day sensational!
We
are trying to raise $5000 to purchase more rafts for this year’s summer camp. Campers
will be talking for the rest of the year about the fun they had on the river,
so please help us, get them back out there. 
Get
the word out to your friends and family, help us raise money for our special
needs summer camp",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The sole act of hanging upside down
 on the sling unloads the spine: thus relieving pressure on nerve roots 
due to poor postural habits, lack of proper stretching &amp; exercise 
and the effects of gravity and our own body weight. Inversion alleviates
 muscle tension, neck &amp; back pain, promotes increased joint 
mobility, flexibility, relaxation and increased circulation of blood, 
lymph &amp; energy. It is an incredible anti-stress and anti-aging 
practice – we like to call it a “natural botox.”</p>
<p>The Yogena™ 
suspension system is an inversion sling that allows you to suspend in an
 inverted position with your pelvis and leg muscles bearing your body 
weight. This position eliminates all gravitational 
compression. Inversion therapy is the safest, quickest and most 
effective way to increase the space between your vertebrae. Numerous 
clinical studies published in reputable medical journals have 
confirmed that inversion really does increase the separation between 
the discs of the spine, which brings relief from back pain. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/379836/files/20140219060500-degen_disc_types_label_illus51.png?1392818700"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p><span><span><span><b>Benefits of Inversion Therapy</b></span></span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/379644/files/20140219043955-bc2.png?1392813595"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/379647/files/20140219044041-Untitled1.jpg?1392813641"" src="""" style=""""/></p><span><span><h1>Suspension Yoga</h1>

that can be used as a yoga prop, a suspension trainer and can be used indoors or outdoors. The
 hammock weights only 5 lbs, comes with its own bag and can be set up in
 less than 2 minutes on any support beam or two points that are strong 
enough to hold your weight. The hammock is made from parachute nylon and
 polyester webbing and can hold up to 700 lbs.

</p>
<p>It comes with 4  carabiners (strength 12 kN or 2,697 lbs each) 
and includes 2 daisy chains (4.5 feet each) with 22 pockets.The actual 
length of the hammock fabric is 92 inches and width is 48 inches. It can
 comfortably accommodate one person; however, we have also put two 
people in the hammock and it was ok. </p>
<p>There are plastic adjusters 
on both sides of the hammock that can be used to adjust the availability
 of fabric and as such, the hammock can be used as a yoga prop for 
suspension yoga and spinal decompression. The user can invert 180 
degrees in 3 easy steps using the handles to support the user's body 
weight while inverting.</p>
<p>All it needs are 2 suspension points 
strong enough to hold your weight. As such, it can be used from monkey 
bars, tree branches, exposed beams and pretty much everywhere you can

The sole act of hanging upside down
 on the sling unloads the spine: thus relieving pressure on nerve roots 
due to poor postural habits, lack of proper stretching & exercise 
and the effects of gravity and our own body weight. Inversion alleviates
 muscle tension, neck & back pain, promotes increased joint 
mobility, flexibility, relaxation and increased circulation of blood, 
lymph & energy. It is an incredible anti-stress and anti-aging 
practice – we like to call it a “natural botox.”
The Yogena™ 
suspension system is an inversion sling that allows you to suspend in an
 inverted position with your pelvis and leg muscles bearing your body 
weight. This position eliminates all gravitational 
compression. Inversion therapy is the safest, quickest and most 
effective way to increase the space between your vertebrae. Numerous 
clinical studies published in reputable medical journals have 
confirmed that inversion really does increase the separation between 
the discs of the spine, which brings relief from back pain. Benefits of Inversion TherapySuspension Yoga
Suspension Yoga uses 
an inversion sling as a prop to help achieve the traditional Yoga 
asnas, the weight of the body being either partially or fully supported 
by the inversion hammock.Our Suspension Yoga training manual includes:Inversions and arm balancesApproach to sequencingIsolation for alignment in standing posesInversions and arm balancesSeated, inverted and standing posesSafety and modificationsPartner workWorking 1:1Language and facilitationRelaxation – forward bendsInstallationSetting up a class room for group classesIncorporating the sling into existing practiceWhat is the Yogena Inversion Sling?The Yogena Inversion Sling is a patent pending (USPTO Application # 61/853,846) recreational hammock & inversion sling 
that can be used as a yoga prop, a suspension trainer and can be used indoors or outdoors. The
 hammock weights only 5 lbs, comes with its own bag and can be set up in
 less than 2 minutes on any support beam or two points that are strong 
enough to hold your weight. The hammock is made from parachute nylon and
 polyester webbing and can hold up to 700 lbs.


It comes with 4  carabiners (strength 12 kN or 2,697 lbs each) 
and includes 2 daisy chains (4.5 feet each) with 22 pockets.The actual 
length of the hammock fabric is 92 inches and width is 48 inches. It can
 comfortably accommodate one person; however, we have also put two 
people in the hammock and it was ok. 
There are plastic adjusters 
on both sides of the hammock that can be used to adjust the availability
 of fabric and as such, the hammock can be used as a yoga prop for 
suspension yoga and spinal decompression. The user can invert 180 
degrees in 3 easy steps using the handles to support the user's body 
weight while inverting.
All it needs are 2 suspension points 
strong enough to hold your weight. As such, it can be used from monkey 
bars, tree branches, exposed beams and pretty much everywhere you can 
suspend it from.Better than TRX/Jungle GymThe Yogena Inversion Sling also doubles as a suspension trainer and is better than other suspension trainers like TRX or Jungle gym since its patent pending design includes 3 handles per handle set. Future Plans
We would like to introduce the Yogena Inversion Sling in a variety of new colors. These would be:
Red fabric + black webbing, Green fabric + black webbing, Orange fabric + yellow webbing, Purple fabric + black webbing",26.0,2,"3 Campaigns

</p><p><b>Wigs for
Toyua Duncan</b></p>
<p>LaToyua Duncan has always been a
fun loving, personable person! She loves to laugh and meet new people. You see
LaToyua has never met a stranger in her life, because she’s just that kind of
young woman. She’s full of love and full of life. Her outlook on life has always been positive. She’s
an avid movie watcher, listens to music, and loves just being with my friends
and family. On May 42013, she was at work and fainted while ringing a
customer at the register.<span>  LaToyua was
taken for immediate medical care. Everything
checked out fine, the doctors told her that she was anemic, prescribed
potassium pills, and sent her home.  Monday,
May 6<sup>th</sup>, the hospital called saying that she had low blood counts, required
an immediate blood transfusion, and needed to see either a Hematologist or Oncologist
as there were other things to be checked out. 
On May 7th when LaToyua met with the doctor, he noticed swollen lymph
nodes in her neck, armpits, and spleen. 
The Oncologist asked about other symptoms that LaToyua had ignored because
she felt they were all stress related.  Some
of those overlooked symptoms were night sweats, rapid weight loss, shedding hair,
and extreme fatigue.</span></p>
<p>LaToyua was admitted to the
hospital and remained there for 5 days getting poked and prodded. She had blood
transfusions, MRI scans, and CAT scans. Her bone marrow was biopsied and a port
was placed.<span>  LaToyua was faced with the
tough decision of possibly postponing treatment to pursue egg harvesting in the
event that she wanted to have children after treatment ended because you see
she was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s Lymphoma Stage 4b cancer.  She had to choose between starting immediate
treatment and take her chances with fertility later. LaToyua’s chemotherapy
treatment began May 18, 2013 and she received treatment every two weeks for 6
months.  Her last round of treatment
ended October 18, 2013.  Her pet scans
were clearing up and everyone was hopeful that LaToyua was in remission until a
November pet scan indicated activity for concern in her chest.  </span></p>
<p>LaToyua spoke with a specialist
and he determined that she was not a viable candidate for radiation treatment.<span>  You see she has family history of breast
cancer and because of that it was determined that radiation therapy would not
improve her chances of survival.  This
prognosis weighed heavily on LaToyua throughout the 2013 holiday season.  No matter what was happening or how much fun
was going on around LaToyua; there was a constant fear gnawing in the back of
her head. Her fight for life was real and it was now.  On the 28<sup>th</sup> of February, LaToyua
saw her doctor again only to discover that her lymphoma had returned. This time
it was in her chest, left side of her neck, and left armpit again.  Her prescribed therapy requires LaToyua to be
hospitalized every two weeks for 4-5 days at a time.  </span></p>
<p>LaToyua is now scheduled for a
stem cell transplant to save her life similar to the surgery Robin Roberts on
GMA went through last year.<span>  All hope is
that the stem cell transplant, like with Robin Roberts, will restart LaToyua’s
immune system and rid her life of lymphoma as a constant concern.  Well the most recent chemotherapy treatment
has caused LaToyua to lose her hair. While we all believe that she is
absolutely gorgeous with or without hair; LaToyua feels even more beautiful with
her crowning glory. </span></p>
<p><b><i>After everything she has been through, we
would love for LaToyua to have enough wigs that she can change her hair style
as many times as she changes her mind. </i></b>She can’t control the Lymphoma, only God can
do that. She can only follow the medical recommendations. We (You and I) can
control her wig count. Salon Envy Atlanta has agreed to economically design
custom wigs for LaToyua from whatever donations are given for this cause.<span>  <b><i>Please join me and let’s give LaToyua wigs

<div>Killer Workout= To push yourself to get that extra, when you thought you had nothing more left. </div>
<div><span style=""font-size: 16px; background-color: initial;"">Right motivation at the right time is the KEY for a killer workout!!</span></div> <p><b>WorkoutMotivator (MyMotivator?)</b> is built with this same idea, to get you the right motivation at the right time intensifying your workout and your workout results.## that everyone of us workout better and with much more intensity when working out with a workout buddy who motivates us to push for that little extra.####<br/>Now imagine how awesome would it be, if we all had a running buddy or cycling buddy ,anytime anywhere we wanted, who's main job would be to monitor your workout progress and provide you with live motivational audio feedback at different intervals, especially in those final moments of the workout when you feel you have nothing left, making you push harder, faster, longer for that little extra thus making your workout a success and not just another run in the park. </p>
<p><b>WorkoutMotivator is an mobile application for your iPhones &amp; andriod phones, which will enable every runner &amp; cyclist to have a similar experience as working out with a personal trainer who will motivate you to push harder you to get an optimal workout.</b></p>
<p><b>WorkoutMotivator is designed to help runners &amp; cyclist measure their performance and provide them with live audio motivational messages depending on their progress at user defined intervals.</b></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </span><br/></p>
</div><div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>
<br/>So for this exciting project of ours, we need a primary funding of $ 50K which will help us design WorkoutMotivator so that it is most user friendly and brings in the unique running/cycling experience we promise.</div>
<div>With the funding we would also hire professional trainers to record the motivational audio messages the runners&amp;cyclists will hear, which will be a unique experience helping them push that extra bit.</div>
<div>Obtaining an Patent and legal fees will account for part for the funding.</div>
<div>And the remaining part of it will also be used to take WorkoutMotivator to the <b>next level</b> where it can be used for indoor workouts (pushups, pullups, burpees, ..and all that). Without disclosing much, this will feature will come with cool wearable.</div>

</div><div> <p></p>
<p>Often most of us workout without knowing how well we really did,did we really push ourselves to our limits? What if there was someone to keep a track and <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">motivate us especially at those crucial moments when we think we should stop, and instead make us push to get that extra lap or to run extra fast.</span></p>
<p>Most of us workout better when we have someone to monitor our workout and push us to make that extra effort when we are about to give up. That is what differentiates a regular workout from a killer workout! A workout which makes you feel you gave your 110%. WorkoutMotivator is made just for that, to push us that extra 10% &amp; help us really achieve our goals. </p>
<p><b>Help us to help everyone get their personal trainer in form of WorkoutMotivator to get to their individual fitness goals!!</b></p>
<p><b>Distinct Features:</b></p>
<p><b>Goal Based Workout: </b>User will set a target time before each workout. Aim is to beat that time. </p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Motivational audio messages during workouts, for that extra push.</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Make every workout count. Option to purchase special motivational audio messages in different accents!</span><br/></p>

Killer Workout= To push yourself to get that extra, when you thought you had nothing more left. 
Right motivation at the right time is the KEY for a killer workout!! WorkoutMotivator (MyMotivator?) is built with this same idea, to get you the right motivation at the right time intensifying your workout and your workout results.## that everyone of us workout better and with much more intensity when working out with a workout buddy who motivates us to push for that little extra.####Now imagine how awesome would it be, if we all had a running buddy or cycling buddy ,anytime anywhere we wanted, who's main job would be to monitor your workout progress and provide you with live motivational audio feedback at different intervals, especially in those final moments of the workout when you feel you have nothing left, making you push harder, faster, longer for that little extra thus making your workout a success and not just another run in the park. 
WorkoutMotivator is an mobile application for your iPhones & andriod phones, which will enable every runner & cyclist to have a similar experience as working out with a personal trainer who will motivate you to push harder you to get an optimal workout.
WorkoutMotivator is designed to help runners & cyclist measure their performance and provide them with live audio motivational messages depending on their progress at user defined intervals.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
 What We Need & What You Get

So for this exciting project of ours, we need a primary funding of $ 50K which will help us design WorkoutMotivator so that it is most user friendly and brings in the unique running/cycling experience we promise.
With the funding we would also hire professional trainers to record the motivational audio messages the runners&cyclists will hear, which will be a unique experience helping them push that extra bit.
Obtaining an Patent and legal fees will account for part for the funding.
And the remaining part of it will also be used to take WorkoutMotivator to the next level where it can be used for indoor workouts (pushups, pullups, burpees, ..and all that). Without disclosing much, this will feature will come with cool wearable.



 The Impact
 
Often most of us workout without knowing how well we really did,did we really push ourselves to our limits? What if there was someone to keep a track and motivate us especially at those crucial moments when we think we should stop, and instead make us push to get that extra lap or to run extra fast.
Most of us workout better when we have someone to monitor our workout and push us to make that extra effort when we are about to give up. That is what differentiates a regular workout from a killer workout! A workout which makes you feel you gave your 110%. WorkoutMotivator is made just for that, to push us that extra 10% & help us really achieve our goals. 
Help us to help everyone get their personal trainer in form of WorkoutMotivator to get to their individual fitness goals!!
Distinct Features:
Goal Based Workout: User will set a target time before each workout. Aim is to beat that time. 
Motivational audio messages during workouts, for that extra push.Make every workout count. Option to purchase special motivational audio messages in different accents!
MyMotivator Challenge.  (Keeping the discipline) 
Take on the MyMotivator Challenge, which are time based (1 week , 2 week, 1 month) & are available in 3 levels easy, moderate & Rockymode.  Also most of us workout better when we define our workout targets. Its nice to know how much progress we have made towards our target, its what keeps us focused & motivated. WorkoutMotivator is designed just for that to keep us on track by designing our workout targets time based. 
Goal Coach: Suggests new workout goals based on previous performance.
Live track your runs & bike rides: GPS tracking of outdoor activities.
Advanced Reports: Workout is split in intervals to showing how user performance varied at different stages of workout. Mark intervals where there is scope for improvement.
Auto Logs: Auto save entire workout summary over cloud to measure progress.
Ranking: Compare personal best with other users in same city & same age group.

sponsorship campaign, we are inviting our fans to join forces with us in
 a
championship quest. We believe the time has come to provide fans with 
unique opportunities to get closer to the action and the inner workings 
of an NHRA team.
The packages we are offering as memberships to Team Angelle have been 
designed
to provide fans with unique experiences as participating sponsors. You will see the various opportunities in the Perks section. To qualify for a membership to become part of Team Angelle, you must select an option from the Perks list and provide us with your contact and shipping information.<br/><br/>Now back to the story behind our campaign...<br/>
<br/>When  I was asked to return to the NHRA circuit last year by George 
and  Jackie Bryce of Star Racing, the overpowering pull that ultimately 
 brought me back to the track was my connection with our fans. Over the 
 years, I've heard competitors across a wide spectrum of sports tell  
people they have the greatest fans in world. Having deeply enjoyed the  
relationships I have had the great fortune to build with all of you, I  
would challenge anyone in any sport to prove their fans are more  
dedicated, more committed and more connected than any one of you who has
  reached out to me through the years. It can't be done, you guys are 
the  best!<br/><br/>I cannot overstate the strength that each of you  
provides for me as I work with the Star Racing team on giving you my  
best each time we come to the track. Every one of you serves as an  
inspiration to me. We want to go faster and be sharper with every run  
because you are in our corner. A great deal has changed since I left our
  sport some six years ago, and your support is something we value and  
cherish.<br/><br/>Like any motorsport, the NHRA circuit relies  on 
sponsorship dollars for teams to compete. Unfortunately in today's  
ever-changing and still-recovering economy, the dollars for potential  
sponsors to dedicate at significant levels are far less available for  
all teams than in the days prior to the Great Recession. Before teams  
can compete on the track, we have to compete for funding. As always,  
sponsorships have to be the right fit for the sponsors and the teams  
involved. At Star Racing, we believe that the time has arrived to change
  the dynamics involved with funding a race team. We hope you will agree
  as we strive to provide our fans with opportunities to enjoy unmatched
  experiences.<br/><br/>With your support of this campaign, we  believe 
that we will consistently race to Winner's Circle and we will be in  the
 hunt for the Points Championship this season. As I said earlier, we  
also believe the time has arrived to give fans to have the opportunity  
to get closer to the action and the inner workings of a NHRA team. The  
packages we are offering to our fans as memberships to Team Angelle have
  been designed to provide you with one-of-a-kind memorabilia and unique
  experiences that will take you behind the ropes of our race operation.<br/><br/>As
  I've said many times, George, Jackie and everyone at Star Racing have 
 put together a terrific team. Our bike is very fast and the program we 
 have in place makes us competitive at every track on the circuit. At  
this point, it's just a matter of bringing together the resources to  
further enhance our program and to have the ability to participate in  
every race on the schedule.<br/><br/>We are ready to take the  next steps 
and we are reaching out to our fans who share the same deep  passion and
 love for the sport as we do. By becoming a member of Team  Angelle, you
 have an opportunity to be a part of changing the dynamic of  our sport.
 The victories we will achieve on this journey will be ones  that we 
will share with you.<br/><br/>I would like you to find out more about the campaign. We  have a couple of 
different ways that you can become a member of Team  Angelle. We've 
designed fan sponsorship packages to fit different  budgets. We know 
times are still tight and we respect the choices  everyone must make in 
deciding how to spend your money. The racing  program we have put in 
place is both economical and highly effective in  making the most 
efficient use of our available budget.<br/><br/>There's  no question we 
have plenty of horsepower on the bike, but the real  strength of our 
team is our fans. Through becoming a member of Team  Angelle, our fans 
will be the true horsepower of our run to the Winner's Circle and the Points
 Championship. Your passion for what we bring to the track  each week 
will serve as the actual pistons that drive us down the track.  We want 
to be in a position to share a championship experience with  you.<br/><br/>We
 appreciate your time and consideration  concerning this campaign. I am 
looking forward to sharing my experiences  with our fans throughout the 
season. I would encourage  you to continue to visit this
 website for the latest news on the  campaign and what we are doing at

We are a program promoting healthy, empowered & culturally sensitive births within the refugee community of Clarkston, Georgia, on the edge of metro Atlanta.

Our Mission
We educate, advocate and empower mothers during their pregnancy and postpartum period. We do this by offering classes covering healthy pregnancy practices, newborn care, breastfeeding, women’s health issues and reproductive health. Embrace also hosts gatherings of moms affectionately called ""Moms Circles”.  These gatherings allow refugee women regular opportunities to discuss postpartum health, adjustments to having a newborn living in the home and a myriad of topics that cover the early years of parenting. Alongside these group events, our volunteers support individual women throughout their pregnancy, birth and postpartum experience.
Last year 39 women from within the refugee community attended classes and/or were paired with a volunteer during their pregnancy.  Forty percent of these women came to us by word of mouth and interest in our classes is growing more and more each week! It is only May  and we have already served 32 women. Considering the fact that we helped 39 women in total last year, we are growing at an extremely fast rate. This growing success creates a need for further financial resources.
We invite you to be a partner with us during this exciting time!

  What We Need



Because of this record growth, we need to expand our class series and our Moms Circles. This expansion would include holding classes and Moms Circles more frequently, hiring more translators and updating our class materials. Expanding our classes and Moms Circles will allow us to reach more refugee women, provide even more thorough educational content and build more community among new mothers.


Once our goal of $2,000 is reached, we can begin expanding our classes! Will you help make it happen?
The Impact




The refugee women we serve are precious, resilient women who long to have the resources, support and community that Embrace provides.  We are honored to be able to do this work and hope that, with your assistance, we can increase the number of mothers that we can serve and the healthy little ones we can welcome!

<p>The <b>100%
ECO-EV Range Extender</b> has the ability to provide continual range extension
on any Electric Vehicle with <b><u>one or
several </u></b>contraptions that <b>convert
kinetic energy into electrical energy while the vehicle is driven</b> in any
environment.  </p>
<p><b>Sounds similar to
Regenerative Braking? Yes! </b>It is; the ultimate results are clear, to convert
kinetic energy into electrical energy.</p>
<p><b>Our <u>ultimate
goal</u> over the past 5 years, was to adapt an electric vehicle in a manner in
which we would be able to <u>re-capture</u> as much wasted energy as possible,
while driving.  </b></p>
<p>We also had to take into consideration <b>Newton’s Second Law of Motion</b>, which is
the relationship between an object’s mass <i>m</i>,
its acceleration a, and applied force <i>F </i>is
<b><i>F
= ma</i></b><i>.</i></p>
<p>Based on those considerations, within <b>Newton’s Second Law of Motion</b>, we have
developed a unique and exceptionally effective means of energy re-capture, with
our <b>100% ECO-EV Range Extender</b>. </p>
<p>In addition to utilizing Regenerative Brakes, Solar
Panels and other Regeneration Concepts; our contraption, the <b>100% ECO-EV Range Extender,</b> which also starts converting kinetic energy<span>into
electric energy within seconds after the vehicle is accelerated; will provide
more energy as the speed of the vehicle is increased.  This energy is thus used immediately or
stored until needed.</span></p>

<h3><b>Electrical Engineering Capstone Project</b></h3>
<p>Scientific Evidence concludes that
the ECO-EV Range Extender concept, as demonstrated, “works and therefore the
conversion is good for the environment, good for humanity, and good for the
economy”.</p>
<p>These were the findings that were <b>compiled for a Final Capstone Course
Project</b>, by four Electrical Engineering students from the Inter American
University at Bayamón, Puerto Rico.  They
concluded that the ECO-EV Range Extender Concept is not only <b>feasible</b>, <u>but implementable in all
Electric Vehicles in the future</u>.</p>
<p>The study; which took a bit more
than 14 weeks, or approximately 100 days, was presented on April 25, 2014, at
the School of Engineering, at the Inter American Bayamón Campus.</p>
<p>From Drag Force coefficients, to
pricing comparisons between gas and electric vehicles, this group of future
Electrical Engineers did not miss a detail and were very explicit in their
findings. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/826918/files/20140901130223-EV_Drag_Diagram.png?1409601743"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><h2><b>Solar Panel</b></h2>
<p>Additionally, they provided optimal
recommendations from the multiple simulations and tests conducted by them. </p>
<p>The Prototype Vehicle was
completely in their hands during these simulations, formulas, and testing.  </p>
<p>All the results were based on the
Prototype Vehicle’s parameters and actual performance’s.  </p>
<p>As part of their recommendations
and in order to make the Vehicle look and feel more <b>Ecological</b>, they added a 230-Watt <b>Solar
Panel</b> to the vehicles’ roof. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/826919/files/20140901130356-IMG_0757__640x480_.JPG?1409601836"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The addition of the <b>Solar Panel</b> has been a key element in
making our Prototype vehicle a more attractive vehicle with regards to energy
awareness and the Eco-Friendly concept for Electric Vehicles.  It complements the other contraptions and
concepts.  </p>
<p>Since the <b>Solar Panel</b> also augments our concept vehicle, twofold, Eco
awareness, and actual electric energy production, we are very excited to keep
it as part of our <b>Earth-EV™</b> Proof of Concept. </p>

<p>The
ECO-EV Range Extender and <b><span>Earth-EV™</span></b>can
be manufactured or further developed with several of the following options that
can be made available with your support.  </p>
<p>1.<span>  </span>The first would be;
car owners that are capable of connecting their home to their vehicle in order
to use the stored energy in their homes. This can be done by connecting a
Grid-Tie Inverter to the battery bank of the vehicle. Or, it can even use the
energy with a regular inverter for any other purpose, and not tie-in to the
home energy system. For example, providing energy to a cottage, or when you go
camping. </p>
<p>2.<span>  </span>Secondly, adapt a
model for all current electric and hybrid vehicles in order to sell directly to
those owners and create a demand for technicians to install them in these
vehicles.</p>
<p>3.<span>  </span>Thirdly, obtain
licensing agreement with as many vehicle manufacturers worldwide. Especially
those that are currently manufacturing and selling Electric Vehicles now.Vehicles are manufactured in at least 21
countries, and over 75 million vehicles are built every year.</p>
<p>4.<span>  </span>Establish a U.S.
based Electric Vehicle manufacturing plant to build the <b>Earth-EV™’s </b>from the bottom up
and create more jobs in America.</p>
<p>The <b>Earth-EV™ </b>is a Proof of Concept
Electric Vehicle, which includes our invention called the 100% ECO-EV Range Extender.  This project has <span>been worked on for nearly five (5) years, and we are continually upgrading
and perfecting our concept in order to present a fully Comprehensible and
Enforceable Utility Patent in the very near future.  </span></p>
<p>We currently have
a Provisional Patent, which makes the concept Patent Pending. </p>
<p><b><i>The actual
contraption idea will not be divulged here until the proper intellectual
property protection is obtained. </i></b></p>
<p>We have provided
visual evidence which shows the effectiveness of our idea(s) and have a stock
of raw videos that can be posted online if needed.</p>
<p><b>With your help and support</b>, we can achieve everyone’s
dream of having their transportation expenses cut drastically and possibly never
again pour gasoline into a car!  </p>
<p>Just think, never
having to visit a gas station and get out of your car and be exposed to the
dangers of doing so.  These dangers
include crimes such as robbery, aggressions, among others that are committed in
these locations.  Robberies in the United
States, where convenience stores are included; occur one every minute of each
day. (<i>According to FBI statistics</i>) </p>
<br/><h3><b>Current
Market to our Concept Prototype:</b></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/826927/files/20140901130937-evcars.png?1409602177"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>On the average, an Electric Vehicle
(EV) will use <b>500-600 Watt hours (Wh)
per mile</b>. With our Proof of Concept Vehicle, we are achieving very high
Range Extensions; which can help eliminate “Range Anxiety” once and for all. </p>
<p>As a matter of
fact example; when one of the ECO-EV
Range Extender contraptions is installed in our <b>Earth-EV™</b>, it provides the following data being driven at 35 mph. </p>
<p><b>@35 mph</b>, the following was obtained:
 </p>
<p>Amp x Volts= Watts</p>
<p>1.5 Amps x 80 Volts =
120watts</p>
<p><b>120 Watt hours (Wh) per mile</b></p>
<p>The Amps are a constant factor from
the Generator used, and the volts are what is read on your electric meter at a
specific moment from the contraption. 
So, if we were driving consistently at around <b>35 mph </b>our vehicle
would be <b>re-generating</b> around 120
watts of electrical energy.  </p>
<p><b>Speed fact:</b> the faster the vehicle drives, the more energy it uses, but our
contraptions will also regenerate more Electrical Energy.  So, the faster you go, the more energy is
circulated within the entire vehicle.</p>
<p>This is an example of just one
contraption. Imagine what will occur if we used three or four contraptions; and
we have.</p>
<p>Installing several contraptions can
be achieved on all vehicles with the proper spacing and battery bank
installation.  </p>
<p>What makes this entire development
practical, is the fact that this is just one of several concepts that has been
implemented in the <b>Earth-EV™</b> Proof of Concept Electric
Vehicle. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/826933/files/20140901131303-totalconcept.png?1409602383"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Since we are dealing here with electrical energy, we must
take into account that <u>when electrical energy is transferred, a substantial
amount of energy loss is endured</u>.</p>
<p>Although we are able to generate and re-generate a great
amount of energy as we drive our vehicle, we can’t take for this achievement
for granted and say that we produce as much as we use.  <b><u>We will never express, or imply such a statement. </u></b> </p>
<p>Different levels of energy can be
acquired at different times and even at the same speed; however, higher or
lower ratings and levels <u>will never be exact</u>.   This
is due to factors, such as: <i>1-Temperature,
2-Road or Terrain, 3-Driver habits, and others</i>.</p>
<h3><b>Gear</b></h3>
<p>We currently use an 84-Volt (DC)
battery bank on the <b>Earth-EV™
</b>Proof of Concept
Electric Conversion Vehicle, and when the battery bank is completely charged,
it can read around 89-91 Volts (DC).  </p>
<p>The Proof of
Concept Vehicle has a U.S.A. made, 72-Volt D&amp;D DC Motor and a U.S.A. made
Alltrax Controller. </p>

<h3><b>Test Sample</b></h3>
<p>One
of our most recent test; even driving at low speeds, <span>around 35mph, the </span><b>Earth-EV™</b> <span>was able to have an </span>efficiency
rating of 98.12%. </p>
<p>On this test, our Battery Bank was fully charged at 90.5
Volts. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/826957/files/20140901132251-905.png?1409602971"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>We drove up and down mountains for approximately 20 minutes
and at a distance of 4.2 miles. At the end of our drive, our Battery Bank ended
with 88.8 Volts.  We divide the ending
Voltage to the beginning Voltage to obtain our efficiency rating. </p>

<p>From past tests
without any of our contraptions, the Battery Bank would have ended at around 75
volts or lower after this 20 minute drive.</p>
<h3><b>Other
Concepts</b></h3>
<p>Another concept
utilized and tested was the Flywheel Generator, but the results obtained were
well below other concepts currently in use.</p>
<p>Additionally, many, many different
apparatuses were used in the development of our pre-final contraption.</p>
<h3><b>Key
Info Facts:</b></h3>
<p><b>  </b>Did you know that for every Dollar you spend on Gas, you are
really only get 18-28 cents worth?  Your
combustible engine wastes the other 82-72¢.
<i>And...</i></p>
<p>  An Electric Vehicle will give you
between 70-90¢ back from every Dollar you spent to charge your EV. So, if you spent $3
charging, you really use approximately $2.10.  <i>So…</i></p>
<p>  In turn, if you spent $3 in Fuel, you only actually use
approximately 75¢ cents. Wow, Really? You may ask, well
yes, you can do the research and you'll see the tremendous waste we have and
will continue to pay for Combustible Energy. Huge difference. </p>
<br/>
</div><div>
<h2><b>What’s next?</b></h2>
<p><b>With your help
and support</b>, our next step will be to complete a contract with our Patent
Attorney and have a detailed Utility Patent drafted and reviewed thoroughly
before submitting it to the United States Patent Office.  The Patent Attorney, is as also an Electrical
Engineer.  We have met previously to
discuss some of our Claims for our concepts. 
This Attorney, worked for several years as a Patent Examiner at the
United States Patent Office in Washington, D.C. 
 </p>
<p>Additionally, we would like
to have a newer Prototype Vehicle built ASAP. 
As it is being built, we will work to have the vehicle submitted to the Oak Ridge
National Laboratory in Tennessee, for complete testing, revision and scientific

It’s been three vehicles and five years since we
started this grand idea of re-charging while driving. 


Started project with this car at our home in Winter Haven, FL and
began extracting the combustion engine. 
Due to health reasons, had to move to Puerto Rico and continue the
project here.


Then, purchased this vehicle and converted the same to
electric, but a combination of factors did not allow for proper mobility with
an undersized electric motor.

Then we found this beautiful Jalopy; this Suzuki was the lightest vehicle available and started working on it from day one.
The 100%
ECO-EV Range Extender has the ability to provide continual range extension
on any Electric Vehicle with one or
several contraptions that convert
kinetic energy into electrical energy while the vehicle is driven in any
environment.  
Sounds similar to
Regenerative Braking? Yes! It is; the ultimate results are clear, to convert
kinetic energy into electrical energy.
Our ultimate
goal over the past 5 years, was to adapt an electric vehicle in a manner in
which we would be able to re-capture as much wasted energy as possible,
while driving.  
We also had to take into consideration Newton’s Second Law of Motion, which is
the relationship between an object’s mass m,
its acceleration a, and applied force F is
F
= ma.
Based on those considerations, within Newton’s Second Law of Motion, we have
developed a unique and exceptionally effective means of energy re-capture, with
our 100% ECO-EV Range Extender. 
In addition to utilizing Regenerative Brakes, Solar
Panels and other Regeneration Concepts; our contraption, the 100% ECO-EV Range Extender, which also starts converting kinetic energyinto
electric energy within seconds after the vehicle is accelerated; will provide
more energy as the speed of the vehicle is increased.  This energy is thus used immediately or
stored until needed.

Here
is our Real 21st Century Electric Vehicle Proof of Concept
Prototype:



Electrical Engineering Capstone Project
Scientific Evidence concludes that
the ECO-EV Range Extender concept, as demonstrated, “works and therefore the
conversion is good for the environment, good for humanity, and good for the
economy”.
These were the findings that were compiled for a Final Capstone Course
Project, by four Electrical Engineering students from the Inter American
University at Bayamón, Puerto Rico.  They
concluded that the ECO-EV Range Extender Concept is not only feasible, but implementable in all
Electric Vehicles in the future.
The study; which took a bit more
than 14 weeks, or approximately 100 days, was presented on April 25, 2014, at
the School of Engineering, at the Inter American Bayamón Campus.
From Drag Force coefficients, to
pricing comparisons between gas and electric vehicles, this group of future
Electrical Engineers did not miss a detail and were very explicit in their
findings. 

Solar Panel
Additionally, they provided optimal
recommendations from the multiple simulations and tests conducted by them. 
The Prototype Vehicle was
completely in their hands during these simulations, formulas, and testing.  
All the results were based on the
Prototype Vehicle’s parameters and actual performance’s.  
As part of their recommendations
and in order to make the Vehicle look and feel more Ecological, they added a 230-Watt Solar
Panel to the vehicles’ roof. 

The addition of the Solar Panel has been a key element in
making our Prototype vehicle a more attractive vehicle with regards to energy
awareness and the Eco-Friendly concept for Electric Vehicles.  It complements the other contraptions and
concepts.  
Since the Solar Panel also augments our concept vehicle, twofold, Eco
awareness, and actual electric energy production, we are very excited to keep
it as part of our Earth-EV™ Proof of Concept. 


Optimum electric charging
while driving is here to stay!

100% ECO-EV Range Extender + the Earth-EV™


The
ECO-EV Range Extender and Earth-EV™can
be manufactured or further developed with several of the following options that
can be made available with your support.  
1.  The first would be;
car owners that are capable of connecting their home to their vehicle in order
to use the stored energy in their homes. This can be done by connecting a
Grid-Tie Inverter to the battery bank of the vehicle. Or, it can even use the
energy with a regular inverter for any other purpose, and not tie-in to the
home energy system. For example, providing energy to a cottage, or when you go
camping. 
2.  Secondly, adapt a
model for all current electric and hybrid vehicles in order to sell directly to
those owners and create a demand for technicians to install them in these
vehicles.
3.  Thirdly, obtain
licensing agreement with as many vehicle manufacturers worldwide. Especially
those that are currently manufacturing and selling Electric Vehicles now.Vehicles are manufactured in at least 21
countries, and over 75 million vehicles are built every year.
4.  Establish a U.S.
based Electric Vehicle manufacturing plant to build the Earth-EV™’s from the bottom up
and create more jobs in America.
The Earth-EV™ is a Proof of Concept
Electric Vehicle, which includes our invention called the 100% ECO-EV Range Extender.  This project has been worked on for nearly five (5) years, and we are continually upgrading
and perfecting our concept in order to present a fully Comprehensible and
Enforceable Utility Patent in the very near future.  
We currently have
a Provisional Patent, which makes the concept Patent Pending. 
The actual
contraption idea will not be divulged here until the proper intellectual
property protection is obtained. 
We have provided
visual evidence which shows the effectiveness of our idea(s) and have a stock
of raw videos that can be posted online if needed.
With your help and support, we can achieve everyone’s
dream of having their transportation expenses cut drastically and possibly never
again pour gasoline into a car!  
Just think, never
having to visit a gas station and get out of your car and be exposed to the
dangers of doing so.  These dangers
include crimes such as robbery, aggressions, among others that are committed in
these locations.  Robberies in the United
States, where convenience stores are included; occur one every minute of each
day. (According to FBI statistics) 
Current
Market to our Concept Prototype:

On the average, an Electric Vehicle
(EV) will use 500-600 Watt hours (Wh)
per mile. With our Proof of Concept Vehicle, we are achieving very high
Range Extensions; which can help eliminate “Range Anxiety” once and for all. 
As a matter of
fact example; when one of the ECO-EV
Range Extender contraptions is installed in our Earth-EV™, it provides the following data being driven at 35 mph. 
@35 mph, the following was obtained:
 
Amp x Volts= Watts
1.5 Amps x 80 Volts =
120watts
120 Watt hours (Wh) per mile
The Amps are a constant factor from
the Generator used, and the volts are what is read on your electric meter at a
specific moment from the contraption. 
So, if we were driving consistently at around 35 mph our vehicle
would be re-generating around 120
watts of electrical energy.  
Speed fact: the faster the vehicle drives, the more energy it uses, but our
contraptions will also regenerate more Electrical Energy.  So, the faster you go, the more energy is
circulated within the entire vehicle.
This is an example of just one
contraption. Imagine what will occur if we used three or four contraptions; and
we have.
Installing several contraptions can
be achieved on all vehicles with the proper spacing and battery bank
installation.  
What makes this entire development
practical, is the fact that this is just one of several concepts that has been
implemented in the Earth-EV™ Proof of Concept Electric
Vehicle. 

Since we are dealing here with electrical energy, we must
take into account that when electrical energy is transferred, a substantial
amount of energy loss is endured.
Although we are able to generate and re-generate a great
amount of energy as we drive our vehicle, we can’t take for this achievement
for granted and say that we produce as much as we use.  We will never express, or imply such a statement.  
Different levels of energy can be
acquired at different times and even at the same speed; however, higher or
lower ratings and levels will never be exact.   This
is due to factors, such as: 1-Temperature,
2-Road or Terrain, 3-Driver habits, and others.
Gear
We currently use an 84-Volt (DC)
battery bank on the Earth-EV™
Proof of Concept
Electric Conversion Vehicle, and when the battery bank is completely charged,
it can read around 89-91 Volts (DC).  
The Proof of
Concept Vehicle has a U.S.A. made, 72-Volt D&D DC Motor and a U.S.A. made
Alltrax Controller. 
                                                      



Test Sample
One
of our most recent test; even driving at low speeds, around 35mph, the Earth-EV™ was able to have an efficiency
rating of 98.12%. 
On this test, our Battery Bank was fully charged at 90.5
Volts. 



We drove up and down mountains for approximately 20 minutes
and at a distance of 4.2 miles. At the end of our drive, our Battery Bank ended
with 88.8 Volts.  We divide the ending
Voltage to the beginning Voltage to obtain our efficiency rating. 



(These results can vary
due to many factors, such as driving habits, and/or other external factors.)

From past tests
without any of our contraptions, the Battery Bank would have ended at around 75
volts or lower after this 20 minute drive.
Other
Concepts
Another concept
utilized and tested was the Flywheel Generator, but the results obtained were
well below other concepts currently in use.
Additionally, many, many different
apparatuses were used in the development of our pre-final contraption.
Key
Info Facts:
  Did you know that for every Dollar you spend on Gas, you are
really only get 18-28 cents worth?  Your
combustible engine wastes the other 82-72¢.
And...
  An Electric Vehicle will give you
between 70-90¢ back from every Dollar you spent to charge your EV. So, if you spent $3
charging, you really use approximately $2.10.  So…
  In turn, if you spent $3 in Fuel, you only actually use
approximately 75¢ cents. Wow, Really? You may ask, well
yes, you can do the research and you'll see the tremendous waste we have and
will continue to pay for Combustible Energy. Huge difference. 


What’s next?
With your help
and support, our next step will be to complete a contract with our Patent
Attorney and have a detailed Utility Patent drafted and reviewed thoroughly
before submitting it to the United States Patent Office.  The Patent Attorney, is as also an Electrical
Engineer.  We have met previously to
discuss some of our Claims for our concepts. 
This Attorney, worked for several years as a Patent Examiner at the
United States Patent Office in Washington, D.C. 
 
Additionally, we would like
to have a newer Prototype Vehicle built ASAP. 
As it is being built, we will work to have the vehicle submitted to the Oak Ridge
National Laboratory in Tennessee, for complete testing, revision and scientific
approval of our group of concepts. 
We have multiple Mechanical and Electrical Engineers
available to work with us in order to further develop a manufacturing process
second to none.  We’ll work initially to
complete an end product, and secondly, with the proper financing, looking into
the possibility of creating a complete Electric Vehicle manufacturing plant. 
We also have an
experienced managerial team from multiple manufacturing backgrounds that can assist
with quality control, shipping and other logistics for this new manufacturing
effort.
September/October: Create and maintain multiple relationships with new
friends and future business partners through INDIEGOGO.
Tattoo weekly, or even daily names of
all supporters that donate $10 or above on our first Prototype vehicle.
November: Contract Patent Attorney for Patent drafting, art-work and
submission to USPTO. 
Start process to fulfill rewards from
this INDIEGOGO Crowd-funding effort.
December: Complete INDIEGOGO Crowd-funding rewards fulfillment.
 Commence building a new Prototype Vehicle.
Start process to request submission of
vehicle to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee.
January/February: Finalize, review and submit final Patent Draft to the USPTO.

<p>While the politics and debates of this war in Syria go on endlessly, millions of innocent civilians wake every morning and suffer through each hour of each day, struggling to simply survive and cope with lives torn apart on all levels. For those living in this state of continual trauma and re-traumatization, survival is all that is on their minds. All ages and all walks of life are affected. There is no discrimination with terror, pain, and death on this vast scale, and the numbers are only accelerating as the entire society is now the victim. In the midst of this many are daily losing their childhood, all semblance of normalcy and balance with a world that is dissolving around them, and simply losing their lives. Many are without parents or even older siblings to care for them and must rely day to day on other families, who are themselves in dire conditions, or fend for themselves.<br/><br/>In a society with an undeveloped human service system and scarce resources to begin with, and an erupting humanitarian crisis, there are either no services or fledgling services that are completely overwhelmed and rapidly falling behind in capacity to meet even the most basic of needs.<br/><br/><b>It is the currently millions of displaced, emotionally scarred Syrian children who will most carry these deeply imbedded and continuing wounds into the future as a lost generation - and with it inherited trauma into generations to come, if we do nothing now. </b></p>

<p>Even with the phenomenal success we have

every day.</p>
<p>So while we are
seeking these larger funds to expand and sustain this effort, we are reaching
out through innovative person-to-person avenues like Indiegogo. Whether $1 from
many or lots of dollars from those who have the ability to do more, this can quickly add up to
what is needed for the next steps in front of us. In this case, our immediate
next step is getting our team to Jordan again for a 2 week treatment and
training mission in the massive Zaatari Syrian refugee camp in Jordan Camp.</p>
<p>Our goal here is
modest in comparison to the financial challenge, because <b>we</b> <b>only have 1
month to achieve our goal</b>. But you can help make this happen for thousands
of refugee children who need the support of your donation, <b>right now!</b></p>
<p>Of course more than

Because they are children they also have the least ability to heal and recover on their own, and so have the highest probability of carrying deeply imbedded and debilitating emotional scars into their future as the next generation in the Middle East - if nothing is done now
Right now, Hundreds of trauma therapists are volunteering their time, effort, and skills to provide desperately needed trauma treatment to thousands of Syrian refugee children in Jordan, while at the same time our team is building permanent local capacity to maintain and sustain this service by training hundreds of local health providers. Among us is world renowned clown doctor, Patch Adams.
We are already providing this life-saving work. We need your support to continue and expand it.


  WHAT WE WORK TO ALLEVIATE:
While the politics and debates of this war in Syria go on endlessly, millions of innocent civilians wake every morning and suffer through each hour of each day, struggling to simply survive and cope with lives torn apart on all levels. For those living in this state of continual trauma and re-traumatization, survival is all that is on their minds. All ages and all walks of life are affected. There is no discrimination with terror, pain, and death on this vast scale, and the numbers are only accelerating as the entire society is now the victim. In the midst of this many are daily losing their childhood, all semblance of normalcy and balance with a world that is dissolving around them, and simply losing their lives. Many are without parents or even older siblings to care for them and must rely day to day on other families, who are themselves in dire conditions, or fend for themselves.In a society with an undeveloped human service system and scarce resources to begin with, and an erupting humanitarian crisis, there are either no services or fledgling services that are completely overwhelmed and rapidly falling behind in capacity to meet even the most basic of needs.It is the currently millions of displaced, emotionally scarred Syrian children who will most carry these deeply imbedded and continuing wounds into the future as a lost generation - and with it inherited trauma into generations to come, if we do nothing now. 

  HOW YOU CAN HELP
The next 2-week treatment and training trip to the enormous Zaatari Syrian refugee camp in Jordan for our team of 30 expert healers and trainers is in the 2nd half of OctoberWe have been fortunate to receive significant in-kind support and partnership in Jordan that allow us to accomplish a great deal with very little hard resources. We just need funds to cover out-of-pocket costs to us by our deadline in October.This is why we need your help now - to raise $15,000 to get our team to Jordan so we can continue this urgently needed treatment for thousands caught up in and scarred by the machine of violence and war.
WHERE YOUR MONEY GOES



Whether $1 or thousands of dollars - all donations raised go toward direct services to refugees and training local therapists to continue serving them indefinitely. Out of pocket costs include:  1. Travel and staying in Jordan on these regular trips to provide services 2. Medical and mental health treatment supplies needed to administer treatment, and 3. Materials needed for conducting professional trainings that create a large local pool of permanent therapists

 If we are fortunate to go beyond the $15,000 that will be wonderful, as all additional funds go toward covering costs for our next treatment and training trips.

US Federal Tax Deduction Option:As an option, if you wish your donation to be Tax Deductible for US taxes you can quickly and easily do this by going directly to the website of the International Humanistic Psychology Association (IHPA), a 501(c)3 US federal nonprofit organization, and paying there through the convenient on-line donation feature located on the home page at: http://www.ihpaworld.org/

WHY $15,000
Obviously an initiative of this size and scope requires much more than
$15,000 to operate and continue. 

Many times more than this has already been
spent by those on our team who travel regularly to Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey
providing these services.
Even with the phenomenal success we have
achieved to date enlisting strategic partnerships with committed grass-roots
humanitarian organizations who each contribute an essential piece of the larger
puzzle to make this service happen on a shoe string budget, we now need to
secure significant funding to carry it forward to it’s full potential, and at
the level demanded by the erupting crisis flooding the region with new victims
every day.
So while we are
seeking these larger funds to expand and sustain this effort, we are reaching
out through innovative person-to-person avenues like Indiegogo. Whether $1 from
many or lots of dollars from those who have the ability to do more, this can quickly add up to
what is needed for the next steps in front of us. In this case, our immediate
next step is getting our team to Jordan again for a 2 week treatment and
training mission in the massive Zaatari Syrian refugee camp in Jordan Camp.
Our goal here is
modest in comparison to the financial challenge, because we only have 1
month to achieve our goal. But you can help make this happen for thousands
of refugee children who need the support of your donation, right now!
Of course more than
$15,000 means we immediately bring more treatment and training team members to
do more, and return for our next trip much sooner.



  OUR ORGANIZATIONS AND OUR PROJECT

Common Bond Institute (CBI) and International Humanistic Psychology Association (IHPA) are not-for-profit humanitarian aid organizations based in the US that for decades have provided free, compassionate, and culturally sensitive emergency health care services to refugees in developing countries traumatized by war and violence, and health service training to members of their communities. 
A bio on CBI is available at: www.cbiworld.org/Pages/CBI_Bio.pdf 
We are currently engaged in two major initiatives that make up the Social Health Care (SHC) treatment and training program, in partnership with Jordanian relief organizations and our international network of universities and professional training institutes, to ease the immense suffering of Syrian children in Jordan.  1) ALLEVIATING TRAUMA:  One program is providing desperately needed immediate emergency medical and mental health treatment services to the huge, overflowing Zaatari refugee camp stretched across barren desert in Jordan.  2) TRAINING LOCAL THERAPISTS:  The 2nd program is a comprehensive, local capacity building training program quickly equipping hundreds of local students, adult refugees, and staff of relief organizations in proven trauma recovery skills so they can immediately and permanently expand this service to treat increasingly more victims. The idea is to invest in the local human service and academic
system to grow permanent local ability and self-reliance that progressively reduces the need for continued
outside aid.

  OUR MODEL: 

Rather than only relying on outside assistance - that is temporary, limited, and ends when the outside service providers leave, we travel to Jordan regularly to provide immediate healing services to deeply wounded children - while at the same time build permanent local capacity to maintain and sustain this service by training health providers, and include adult members of the refugees community itself in the pool of trainees.

On each 2 week trip our team of skilled health professionals is going into the camps to provide direct services to refugees, and also conducting these intensive trainings equipping more and more local trauma therapists with the effective skills to continue this service.

These programs are led by our animated advocates of safety, the Safety Starz family. The Safety watches are actually designed around the Safety Starz to make the watches more receptive to children.</p>
<p>Our goal is to instill prevention information into the minds of our children before a harmful event occurs. This education will establish safety habits that will stick with them for a lifetime.</p>

My name is Erving Percy, and several years ago, I experienced the worst 10 minutes of my life. I took my 5-year old daughter to a playground for some fun times, and suddenly within the blink of an eye, she disappeared from my sight. I ran toward where I had last seen her and could not find her. I looked and looked everywhere, frantically calling out her name.
My heart dropped at the thought of living my life without my little girl and having to explain her disappearance to my entire family. After 10 minutes of searching, I was blessed with hearing her voice softly calling out my favorite word, “daddy”. I found her hiding in the park.
Following this scary experience, I thought of how devastating it must be for parents that have lost their child for hours, days or never to be found. 
Today, I am the founder of a start-up company called Safeworx Solutions. Our aim is to provide families and child caretakers with information and services on how to keep kids safe.
In an effort to protect more children, we have designed a child-friendly GPS (Global Positioning System) watch that we firmly believe will help reduce the staggering number of child abductions (600,000+ a year in the U.S), as well as children being bullied. Our watch can be best utilized at playgrounds, schools, theme parks, the zoo, crowded malls, crowded events, etc.
At this point, unfortunately I underestimated the financial requirements needed to make my watch available to the market. Financial institutions have requested that I establish proof of market interest via a fundraiser before they can provide me with the total funding I need. With your support, I'm hoping to reach our goal and complete our product development so we will be able to provide both parents and children with the peace of mind they deserve.
 
For us, it’s not just a project, this is an ongoing movement to keep kids safe!

 
The Problems:
- Kidnappings- In the year 2013, authorities reported 650,000 cases of missing children nationwide. 70% ended up fatal/never found.
- Wandering/Autistic Kids - Protecting the thousands of Wandering kids - a term used to describe autistic kids that walk away from safe environments putting themselves in danger and getting lost. 
- Bullies - 40% of children in schools have been bullied and are too scared to go to school. Young kids are sometimes surrounded, teased or physically assaulted. Many young victims contemplate or commit suicide.
- Threats of Natural Disasters/ Domestic Terrorist acts- Over the past ten years, natural disasters/terrorist acts have have been more prevalent than ever. In the event that such an unexpected danger should occur, a Safety Starz watch could help save your child's life or help you locate them. 

The Solution:

In addition to our Safety watch, we emphasize the importance of taking preventative measures to keep the kids in our communities safe and prepared for challenges they may face when parents/guardians are not around. SafeWorx Solutions is rolling out a variety of educational initiatives to help spread safety tips to children everywhere. These programs are led by our animated advocates of safety, the Safety Starz family. The Safety watches are actually designed around the Safety Starz to make the watches more receptive to children.
Our goal is to instill prevention information into the minds of our children before a harmful event occurs. This education will establish safety habits that will stick with them for a lifetime.

 
 
 Where does your $$$ go?
We currently need $200,000 to complete the development of our product for mass production. Your tax-deductible donation will help
save lives. 
Our bracelet's features will entail the following:
•      *    A child-friendly designed GPS (Global Positioning System) bracelet with   real-time Internet tracking capabilities
•      *    Water resistant  up to 500 feet
•      *    Distress signal alarm (notifying parents and customer support-    pending activation)
•      *    Durable metallic rubber bands to withstand possible cutting with    scissors or knife
•      *    Magnetic lock to be added only to be opened with parent's key
•      *    Rechargeable battery life up to 12 hours when full
•      *   Heart pulse monitor
•      *   Digital watch
•      *   24 hour safety support agents standing by to assist members
Our goal is to make our watches available to children of all economic standings. No child will be left unprotected due to financial limitations.

<p><strong>Greetings</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for joining my campaign! My name is Eric Birkhauser, I am a dad, cyclist, and designer. My formal training is in architecture and my professional focus is on transit architecture. I live in the DC Metro area, and my daily commute involves 25 plus miles of cycling on dedicated bike-paths as well as city streets. I love commuting by bicycle, but recognize the challenges inherent in doing so – <em>e.g.</em>, fatigue, discomfort, and lack of storage for personal belongings. I also recognize that these challenges keep many people from being able to joining me in leaving behind the car and commuting by bicycle. My goal in designing the ZIPcycle is to reduce the challenges by designing a bicycle optimized for efficiency, performance, comfort and convenience.</p>
<p>It is still as challenging to traverse a city by bicycle today as it was in1863 when the bicycle was invented. The bicycle has remained relatively unchanged for well over a hundred years. Meanwhile, the automobile bears little resemblance to its original form. It is time to change that. It is time for the bicycle to evolve to meet the needs of the modern city dweller, and to enable the bicycle to become an integral component of transportation in American cities. The ZIPcycle seeks to do this by applying the fabrication and aerodynamic innovations now standard in the automotive industry, to the elemental and beautiful bicycle.</p>
<p><img alt=""Chassis Diagram"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.kgpds.com/images/projects/industrial%20design_objects/zipcycle_2/009.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Chassis Diagram""/></p>
<p>The goal of this campaign is to raise enough money to build a working prototype; a working proof of concept. Currently, the design is a thoroughly vetted 3D model, inclusive of all working componentry. To progress the design beyond its current virtual state, a working prototype is the next step in bringing the ZIPcycle into production.</p>
<p><strong><img alt=""side view"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.kgpds.com/images/projects/industrial%20design_objects/zipcycle_2/004.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""ZIPcycle side view""/> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>How is the ZIPcycle different?</strong></p>
<p>The ZIPcycle is the next evolution of the bicycle; increasing the efficiency and performance of the bicycle to require less input for more output. In the simplest terms, the ZIPcycle is an recumbent bicycle that has been aerodynamically optimized for less exertion and higher cruising speeds.</p>
<p><img alt=""rear view"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.kgpds.com/images/projects/industrial%20design_objects/zipcycle_2/008.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""ZIPcycle rear view""/></p>
<p>The standard upright bicycle hits an aerodynamic wall as it approaches 20 mph. If you have ever had the experience of riding with a 20 mph tailwind, you have experienced the disintegration of this wall. By shifting and streamlining the body position of the rider, and enclosing the drag causing elements of the bicycle in a fairing, higher cruising speeds are attainable through human power alone. The modern road bicycle and rider has roughly a drag coefficient of .80, the ZIPcycle can drop the coefficient to .14. This reduction in drag effectively means that about 40% less energy is required to maintain a cruising speed of 20 mph.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The essential components of the ZIPcycle include:</strong></p>
<p>A die stamped monocoque aluminum chassis;</p>
<p><img alt=""exploded axon"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.kgpds.com/images/projects/industrial%20design_objects/zipcycle_2/003.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""ZIPcycle exploded axon""/></p>

<p>Lubricated bearings, gears, and chains enclosed within the chassis in an internal driveshaft beam (so you will never again get grease on your clothes);</p>
<p><img alt=""rider position"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.kgpds.com/images/projects/industrial%20design_objects/zipcycle_2/005.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""ZIPcycle ride geometry""/></p>
<p>Hollow tail-box, accessible by tilting the ventilated seat forward, spacious enough for a medium sized bag;</p>
<p><img alt=""hollow tailbox storage"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.kgpds.com/images/projects/industrial%20design_objects/zipcycle_2/007.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""ZIPcycle storage""/></p>
<p>Option for an in-hub motor an lithium ion battery pack to provide hill and acceleration assist functions for cyclists in hilly and mountainous regions;</p>
<p>Additionally, while the intent of this concept is to preserve the traditional open-air experience of the bicycle, the chassis has been designed in tandem with a fairing, and a fairing will be a future exploration of the design.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><strong>How is the ZIPCycle fabricated?</strong></p>
<p>The production version of the ZIPcycle will consist of a die stamped aluminum chassis, comparable to the modern automotive auto-body. This fabrication technique provides the best methodology for making an affordable and mass-producible product.</p>
<p>However, the initial working prototype will be significantly more expensive to produce. The four piece chassis will be CNC milled out of Polyurethane foam, then encased in carbon fiber and epoxy resin, and finally vacuum bagged and cured. The milling cost for the chassis is budgeted to be $10,000, with an additional materials cost of $5,000. Additionally, the working componentry, including the wheels, drivetrain, and steering assembly is budgeted at $3,000. Thus, the goal of this campaign is to raise the $18,000 needed to produce this initial working prototype. The prototype will be used for further testing and refinement, and as a baseline for the production model.</p>
<p>Your funding is critical to making this design a reality. While the basic design of the bicycle is unparalleled in its practicality, elegance and purity, the ZIPcycle provides a viable alternative for high mileage commuters that allows for faster and less exhausting transit. This, alternative when paired with the proper infrastructure, has the potential to revolutionize sustainable transit.</p>
<p><strong> <img alt=""front view"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.kgpds.com/images/projects/industrial%20design_objects/zipcycle_2/000.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""ZIPcycle front view""/></strong></p>
<p><strong>How will the ZIPcycle improve my commute?</strong></p>
<p>The origin of this design is my desire to spend less time commuting on my bike and spend more time with my family. I think that this is a universal goal among bike-commuters! The average commuting bicycle cruising speed is 12 mph. Imagine easily maintaining a 25 mph cruising speed, while eliminating the handlebar strain and seat pressure of the conventional bicycle.  Beyond speed, a core component of the design is maintaining the open air experiential aspect of riding a bicycle, while gaining the drag reductions of fairing enclosed vehicle.</p>
<p>To effectively reduce transit times, and become an effective form of active transit, the ZIPcycle must be accessible to all people. Therefore the larger goal is a sharing program, amortizing the cost over a much larger group of people.

<p>We have calculated that in order to get the correct amount of treatment to help our grandmother Margie, we need 16,500 or more.  There is a 5,500 per week of treatment charge and she has a recommended stay of at least 3 weeks. This amount does not include general well nutrition for future treatments when she returns home. I know that sounds like a lot but its not impossible. I Have provided a link that estimates the exact amount she needs for the Gerson treatment. Her insurance does not cover holistic therapy and we want to help keep her alive and happy by what she believes will make her happy.   </p>

how you can help? 

We have calculated that in order to get the correct amount of treatment to help our grandmother Margie, we need 16,500 or more.  There is a 5,500 per week of treatment charge and she has a recommended stay of at least 3 weeks. This amount does not include general well nutrition for future treatments when she returns home. I know that sounds like a lot but its not impossible. I Have provided a link that estimates the exact amount she needs for the Gerson treatment. Her insurance does not cover holistic therapy and we want to help keep her alive and happy by what she believes will make her happy.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I started getting into running the week my Dad passed away in August. I had completed a 5k in washington in the top 5% and came back to see my Dad had a cancer that had taken over much of his body. He died the next day after I came to see him in the hospital. What made things worse was that he had no life insurance, leaving my Mother to sell much of her possessions and having to come to the conclusion to not pay her mortgage anymore and in a short time will have to foreclose on the house me and my brother grew up in.</p>
<p>I handled much of the details of my Father's passing, funeral arrangements, letting friends and family know, and most importantly comforting my Mother. Running had now turned into a way of therapy because I didn't know what to do about my Mom losing her house.</p>
<p>However, it turned out I was actually not that bad at running. I started finishing in the top 5% and then the top 3 finishers, and then most recently I finished the Tough Mudder race in Seattle in the top 5% qualifying me for the World's Toughest Mudder race in New Jersey in November. Here you have 24 hours to complete as many laps of an 8 mile obstacle course in the cold weather.</p>
<p>If I'm the top finisher, I win $15,000 and that could really help my Mom. I'm going to try my hardest to win, and use my family as motivation, and even though this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to just go to the race, I really just want the chance to win for my Mom, who deserves to have her house.</p>
<p>I'm asking $2000 for airfare, hotel, travel to the site of the race, the race fee ($500) and the price of a go pro camera to film it.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>So there are several ways you can help me.</p>
<p>If you donate $10 to my cause I will send you a signed picture of me at the race letting you know how much it means to me.</p>
<p>If you donate $25 to my cause I will send you a video personally thanking you for your help.</p>
<p>If you donate $100 to my cause and I am able to raise enough money to go to the race and film it I will send you a personally copy of the race you helped me with. Also, I will send you a picture of me at the race, with a personal message thanking you for your contribution.</p>
<p>Along with all of these things, you also get the satisfaction that you are helping out a family who really does need your help.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Any donation will make me so happy to know that people want to help my Mom. She is a great loving person, and truly anything helps us. The impact of what that prize money could do for my Mom is buy her time for me and my brothers to raise more money in the future to help her. I think it's best to ask for help to win the money for the house, then ask for the money for the house. I know we're in a tight spot and I don't want to trouble anyone else with more than what we can maybe do ourselves, at least for now.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand if you can't contribute any funds to our cause but if you could let other people know, and spread the word on the inter webs about it, it would either make or break this campaign.</p>
<p>Please either post on your facebook, twitter, tumblr, or use the indiegogo share tools.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading the details for this campaign and hopefully good things will come! </p>

I started getting into running the week my Dad passed away in August. I had completed a 5k in washington in the top 5% and came back to see my Dad had a cancer that had taken over much of his body. He died the next day after I came to see him in the hospital. What made things worse was that he had no life insurance, leaving my Mother to sell much of her possessions and having to come to the conclusion to not pay her mortgage anymore and in a short time will have to foreclose on the house me and my brother grew up in.
I handled much of the details of my Father's passing, funeral arrangements, letting friends and family know, and most importantly comforting my Mother. Running had now turned into a way of therapy because I didn't know what to do about my Mom losing her house.
However, it turned out I was actually not that bad at running. I started finishing in the top 5% and then the top 3 finishers, and then most recently I finished the Tough Mudder race in Seattle in the top 5% qualifying me for the World's Toughest Mudder race in New Jersey in November. Here you have 24 hours to complete as many laps of an 8 mile obstacle course in the cold weather.
If I'm the top finisher, I win $15,000 and that could really help my Mom. I'm going to try my hardest to win, and use my family as motivation, and even though this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to just go to the race, I really just want the chance to win for my Mom, who deserves to have her house.
I'm asking $2000 for airfare, hotel, travel to the site of the race, the race fee ($500) and the price of a go pro camera to film it.


What You Get
So there are several ways you can help me.
If you donate $10 to my cause I will send you a signed picture of me at the race letting you know how much it means to me.
If you donate $25 to my cause I will send you a video personally thanking you for your help.
If you donate $100 to my cause and I am able to raise enough money to go to the race and film it I will send you a personally copy of the race you helped me with. Also, I will send you a picture of me at the race, with a personal message thanking you for your contribution.

This obviously was not the type of news you would want to receive as a 21-year-old female with no kids; the news that you would never be able to naturally conceive your own child.  Oh, and this was the first few months of our relationship!  We went through a lot our first year of dating, to say the least, and it has only made us stronger.  After Caitlin's surgery, and multiple failed attempts at freezing fertilized eggs before the surgery, we had come to terms with the fact that we wouldn't be able to have children naturally.  Adoption has always been something that we wanted to pursue, and it is still something we will pursue in the future.  But there is something about being pregnant and giving birth yourself that is so so special.  As a male, I don't completely understand it, but seeing Caitlin in tears as she talks about how great the experience of being pregnant will be, I kinda get it.  It is important and it is something we want to try.  We love children and we get to work with kids every day in our careers.  Caitlin as a kindergarten teacher and me as an elementary assistant principal, we find joy in helping little ones.  But we feel it's time we had a little one of our own.  IVF is our only option for Caitlin to become pregnant, as she can no longer produce eggs herself.  We are so excited and blessed that her little sister, Dancey, has agreed to be our egg donor.  There is something amazing in the fact that she is so selflessly giving a part of her to help us out in a time of need. But, now comes the hard part, raising the money.  IVF is an expensive procedure, as you'll see below, and insurance doesn't cover it (imagine that).  So we are calling on friends and family to help us out.  We appreciate anything that you are able to give and we think it's really cool that each of you will have a part in creating a new life with us.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We need financial help!! There are many many fees incurred with IVF ranging from the consultation and doctor visits ($200 each) to ultra sounds, cycle monitoring ($3,000) lab fees ($4,000-$5,000), medicine/hormones ($3000-$4000) and several other fees! We have been lucky enough to find an egg donor (my little sister!), which will save us thousands of dollars, but our baby will still be an expensive baby! You will see many perks that we are able to offer based on your contribution - it is a small way to show our appreciation. </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>There aren't many words that can truly express what your help will do for Brian and I! We both have intentions of more children (adopted) in the future, but wanted one chance to experience the adventure of pregnancy! We have spent years working with children - first in a church setting and now on a daily basis in the school setting. Brian and I absolutely love our careers and find no better feeling than helping guide and love the children in our schools. As we continue to do this for other children in our career, we are ready to begin this in our life away from work, with our own child :)</p>
<p>If we do not make our goal, we still get to keep what we earn! Our total cost during this process will most likely exceed $15,000 - therefore, if we earn more than our goal, it will go towards additional IVF costs.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Whether or not your are able to contribute financially, we can use your support!! Please pass along our story and our website - we welcome help from all! And we THANK YOU so very much :) </p></div>","In the Fall of 2005, everything changed in our lives.  Caitlin had just received the news that her ovarian cancerous tumors would return...for a third time.  After two prior surgeries, the doctors told us that with the next surgery,  they would need to remove what was left of Caitlin’s ovaries.

<p>We are the people behind Camp Kita—Isaiah, Morgan and Sydney. We are siblings who are trying to establish a non-profit to help the children of suicide. Suicide affected our family in July of 2001. That night, our mom gathered us all in the dark living room and broke the news that our father chose to kill himself, leaving the three of us kids behind. While we’re sure that was probably the worst conversation our mom has ever had to initiate, that was basically the only time we discussed it as a family. The three of us independently internalized it for years. Despite our separate approaches to dealing with the grief,  we all felt the same emotions as most kids dealing with this would—guilt, anger, sadness, and embarrassment, though none us had the financial means or available resources to cope with these feelings in a healthy way.</p>
<p>Camp Kita’s mission is to provide a happy place for children of suicide; where they can connect with other kids sharing the same grief and find normalcy and constructive ways to deal with the pain of losing a parent to suicide.</p>
<p>In order to make this camp possible and accessible for our campers, we need to start at “square one” with our funding. This is where we need sponsors like you! The funding that we are asking for would go towards the cost of starting up a non-profit, getting established with the IRS and getting Camp Kita off the ground. </p>
<p>Although we may not reach our financial goals through this venue, any money raised will go towards the start-up costs of legitimizing the program as a non-profit.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you! We can’t wait for Camp Kita to make the impact we know it will.</p>

<h3>Raising money for victims of the Boston Marathon bombing.</h3>
<p>Three people were killed and over 170 injured in the Boston Marathon bombing on 15th April 2013. Many of those 170 have been grievously hurt and these innocent victims are facing long periods of medical treatment and rehabilitation. Many of them will require alterations to their houses and expensive prosthetics, and some of them might need long-term care. I am asking that you sponsor me to run the London Marathon this Sunday (21st April). All money raised will be divided equally between the <a href=""http://onefundboston.org/pdf/theonefundboston.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mayor of Boston's One Fund</a>, a general fund to assist victims of the bombs, and the <a href=""http://blog.challengedathletes.org/2013/04/caf-official-response-to-the-boston-tragedy/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Challenged Athletes Foundation's Boston fund</a>, which will help with rehabilitation of those left disabled after the attack.</p>
<h3>Why am I doing this?</h3>
<p>I have been involved in various endurance sports for many years and have spent more time than most hanging around marathon finish lines. When the bombs went off in Boston I felt that my community had been attacked. I had been given a place for the London Marathon but I had withdrawn a few weeks ago because I wasn't happy with my training, so on Tuesday morning I phoned the London Marathon organisers, explained that I wanted to reactivate my entry so that I could raise money for the Boston survivors and they agreed.</p>
<h3><strong>Why indiegogo?</strong></h3>
<p>I'm using Indiegogo for several reasons. Firstly, I can't use the UK charitable sites such as JustGiving or Virgin Money Giving because these funds are brand new and not registered with them. I can't use the American sites like FirstGiving because I'm not in the US. Hence Indiegogo. Once it's all done and dusted they'll transfer the money to me and I'll donate it straight to the two charities named above. Indiegogo charge a small percentage (4%) which is actually less than JustGiving (5%), but I will put in £100 to start with which will cover all of that so you can be sure that all of your donation goes where it's meant to go. </p>

<h3>Hi, my name is Gianni. I'm a really average working class kid who likes the Bruins, goes to art school.... and I'm currently trying to transition from female to male. I'm a painter and musician in Boston, Massachusetts. I'm also very sick, I have countless severe allergies and I also suffer from fibromyalgia.</h3>
<p>My health issues make it very difficult for me to hold a job or even get a job; I'm very limited in the kinds of work I can actually do. Because of my health, I had to completely ignore being transgender for several years. But now I am finally healthy enough to focus on my gender and transitioning. I am currently in gender therapy and I still need to be approved for hormone treatment, as my health issues are drawing out the process. The only real issue is, I have no steady income. I sell a painting here and there, but it's not even close to enough to pay for copays, new clothes, binders, etc.</p>
<p>This fund is mostly for social transitioning things, things that will aid me in passing as male. I have to change my entire wardrobe and I also need binders and a decent, comfortable stp. It is also for my copays and costs of transition related physicals, blood tests, etc. If you contribute, you will be making an enormous impact on my life. My quality of life will increase dramatically. If the goal amount isn't reached, any acquired funds will still go towards transitioning. I'm really just trying to be able to live a normal, comfortable life.</p>
<p>I will be sending out these perk gifts after the campaign deadline ends.</p>
<ul>
<li>I want everyone to know how much I appreciate their support so anyone who donates $10 or more will get an original work of art!

(On my websites, most of my recent works are elaborate figure studies because I am in the process of preparing for a major figure/portrait series project.) </li>
<li>If you donate $50 - $99, you'll be getting an original oil pastel drawing of something nice like a nature scene or an animal. These can be custom! I specialize in stylized surreal and abstract work so those are also options.

If you don't want anything specific and just want something random, don't email me and I'll just draw something up for you.</li>
<li>If you can donate $100 or more, which is the most amazing thing that could ever happen to me, you'll be getting a custom oil painting. You will be getting an oil painting on a stretched canvas I built myself.

<p>Elka's dream - if you couldn't guess, or don't know us, Elka is my wife. My dreams have always been big and lofty, build an awesome software product when I get out of school next year, get hired by google, or the next facebook, rack up stock options and retire rich.</p>
<p>My wife's dream...much simpler, but no less important : be a mommy.</p>
<p>This is a realizable dream now, as we're on the verge of adopting two amazing foster children as long as everything fans out. It may fall through.... but she wants to go through pregnancy, and feels 'less of a woman' because this is one thing she cannot do, that most other women can. </p>
<p>Elka has a list of health issues that not only inhibit her ability to conceive, but also inhibit her health and longevity. The fact is if her health doesn't improve, she may not be with us in the next 10 years.</p>
<p>Some of her diagnoses include: PCOS(Poly-cystic Ovarian Syndrome), Diabetes, genetic disposition for COPD, and high-likelihood of developing cancerous cells.</p>
<p>To keep her health in check she has been on hormone therapy for a couple of years, but her doctors are urging her to get off those as soon as possible because it will most likely cause her cancer to come back which we definitely don't want to happen.</p>
<p>So she has two options : Get a hysterectomy and forever give up the dream of motherhood(the traditional way, and the joys of pregnancy, and raising from day 1), or get the vertical sleeve gastrectomy surgery.</p>
<p>One of the major things that controls her PCOS / Diabetes is insulin resistence, by getting gastric sleeve even though she is not considered morbidly obese it has been shown to greatly reduce and even get rid of diabetes symptoms completely, which will also highly likely get rid of the PCOS symptoms, and basically kill a lot of birds with one stone.</p>
<p>Her chances of conception will go through the roof, no more diabetes or PCOS symptoms, and no more hormone therapy. </p>
<p>Sadly, self-pay for vertical sleeve gastrectomy is expensive. Plus we've requested enough to also do our first round of in-vitro following surgery.</p>
<h2 style=""background-color: #1eb9c1; color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; padding: 10px; letter-spacing: .04em;"">A Message From Elka</h2>
<p>Firstly I'd like to thank EVERYBODY who has reached out in support of my cause, and helped create this fundraising campaign. May God bless you and keep you strong for your commitment in helping me reach my goal, and become a mother. To each and every person who blogs about this, shares it on Facebook, Twitter, etc, you are my heroes!</p>
<p>My heartfelt gratitude goes out to everyone who gives even the smallest amount. Maybe you know what it's like to be child-less and struggling to conceive, or you know someone in the same boat. It's hard most days, seeing other happy mom's with their bundles of joy sends me into a dark depression, and I don't want to feel that way anymore. I don't want to have this pent up frustration over my lack-of children. Don't get me wrong, I love my foster children, very much, but they could go back anyday, and that will be a huge pain in and of itself.</p>
<p>Becoming a mommy is my purpose in life, and if I can't live to reach my purpose, then can life be worth living? These are questions I ask daily, thank you so much for delivering me from this curse, and helping me to become healthier.</p>
<h2 style=""background-color: #1eb9c1; color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; padding: 10px; letter-spacing: .04em;"">Your Contributions</h2>
<p>Thank you in advance for your contributions and support. It is deeply appreciated and will guarantee you good karma and blessings from God. 100% of your contribution will support Elka's Gastric Sleeve surgery, related expenses, and round 1 of IVF.</p>
<p>Note : Elka's actual surgery is estimated to cost $20,000, but we've set our goal at $25,000 to cover round 1 of IVF, and also cover the IndieGoGo processing fees, and other costs this surgery might have on our family including food, medicine, vitamins, etc.</p>
<p>Paypal payments are preferred as they are available much faster and will help us reach our goal faster. Credit card payments won't hit until after the fundraiser is completed.</p>

<h3>Hey! Welcome to my fundraising campaign that I'm hoping will help fund for my ""reverse"" boob job!</h3>
<h3>My name is Ian Carter Smith... I'm 33 years old, and I am a trans boy. On January 1, 2013, I came out to the world through YouTube about being transgender. Since then I have hit a lot of snags and have ran into a lot of road blocks in my transition... mostly in regards to discrimination of health insurance companies when it comes to covering transgender services. (For instance if you watch this video you'll see that I think my insurance covers my transition because that's what my psychiatrist told me... well, I learned that it DOESN'T!!!) So here I am... asking for some support... pleading for someone to help set me free!</h3>
<h3>And by no means do I want for you to go more broke than you may already be (I know! ""Times iz hard right now!"")... $1, $5, $10... any amount can go a long way.</h3>
<h3>Still not sure you want to donate? Understandable. Maybe you need to get to know me more. You can follow me and all of my progress on YouTube at: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/iancartertransition"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.youtube.com/user/iancartertransition</a>. I will be recording my transition from beginning to end!</h3>
<h3>Also, by helping me fund my surgery... you will be helping other trans guys fund their surgeries in the future. For if my campaign is successful in raising funds for my own surgery, I pledge that I will pay it forward by continuing my fundraising efforts to help other trans guys fund their surgeries. You can even watch the video where I make that pledge on my YouTube channel!</h3>
<h3>Lastly, if you have time... visit my other attempt at fundraising for my surgery at: <a href=""http://www.cafepress.com/iancarterstransitionfund/9711726"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.cafepress.com/iancarterstransitionfund</a> The only thing about this attempt is that I only get a few dollars for each item I sell. So as you can see... I NEED HELP!!!</h3>
<h3>Help this boy become a man!</h3>
<p> </p>
<h3>Thank you so much! And bless all of you!</h3>

<h3>Maggie's Story</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.woai.com/mostpopular/story/Maggies-story-of-survival/hHcx_DrmCkOJvP_i9F0i3g.cspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Maggie McCombs</a> turned 21 years of age December 27th, 2011. She loved to work out, run and enjoyed spending time with friends and family and especially my brother (JC Escamilla). The two began dating in early November and it seemed that a beautiful relationship was blossoming. On January 8, 2012 Maggie and JC Escamilla where leaving Planet Fitness where JC worked and Maggie was a Club Member when they where ambushed by an alleged stalker. Unfortunately JC did not survive the brutal attack but Maggie did. Maggie was critically injured after she was shot five times by her alleged stalker. After enduring extensive medical procedures the doctors could no longer do anything for Maggie she was paralyzed from neck down. After months of agonizing surgeries she is now home from the hospital and is faced with extreme physical and emotional challenges, but that is not all, her parents are struggling to have there home remodeled in order to provide Maggie with just basic care like a shower and bathroom that can accommodate her. They also do not have a vehicle to transport Maggie to her doctor appointments and much needed therapy sessions. They are also faced with mounting medical bills and the financial responsibility that they will need for the lifetime care Maggie will so desperately need. This is why we have set up this campaign. Maggie's story is a story of hope and love. I hope you find it in your hearts to help Maggie and her family.</p>
<h3>What your donation will do</h3>
<p>The family is in desperate need of a wheel chair accessible vehicle, for daily transportation. The overwhelming medical bills and home modifications have made it very difficult for the family to purchase a vehicle on their own. Your contrubution would go a long way to helping Maggie piece her life together and make the simple task of getting around that much easier. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Having a wheel chair accesible vehicle with a ramp and lift will make the daily task of getting around one less challenge that the McCombs family will have to face. Maggie is doing her part to fight to get her life back to normal and transportaion would have a great impact.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, and that is OK. You can still help! Sharing Maggies's story with your family and friends by word of mouth, email, facebook or other social media will help get the word out and reach the biggest audience possible.</p>

On January 8, 2012 Maggie and JC Escamilla where leaving Planet Fitness where JC worked and Maggie was a Club Member when they where ambushed by an alleged stalker. Unfortunately JC did not survive the brutal attack but Maggie did. Maggie was critically injured after she was shot five times by her alleged stalker. After enduring extensive medical procedures the doctors could no longer do anything for Maggie she was paralyzed from neck down. After months of agonizing surgeries she is now home from the hospital and is faced with extreme physical and emotional challenges, but that is not all, her parents are struggling to have there home remodeled in order to provide Maggie with just basic care like a shower and bathroom that can accommodate her. They also do not have a vehicle to transport Maggie to her doctor appointments and much needed therapy sessions. They are also faced with mounting medical bills and the financial responsibility that they will need for the lifetime care Maggie will so desperately need. This is why we have set up this campaign. Maggie's story is a story of hope and love. I hope you find it in your hearts to help Maggie and her family.
What your donation will do
The family is in desperate need of a wheel chair accessible vehicle, for daily transportation. The overwhelming medical bills and home modifications have made it very difficult for the family to purchase a vehicle on their own. Your contrubution would go a long way to helping Maggie piece her life together and make the simple task of getting around that much easier. 


The Impact
Having a wheel chair accesible vehicle with a ramp and lift will make the daily task of getting around one less challenge that the McCombs family will have to face. Maggie is doing her part to fight to get her life back to normal and transportaion would have a great impact.
Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can't contribute, and that is OK. You can still help! Sharing Maggies's story with your family and friends by word of mouth, email, facebook or other social media will help get the word out and reach the biggest audience possible.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>
<br/>Bandages for Brystal</h3>
<p>Brystal is a sweet little baby in Arizona who happens to have a horrible skin disease called rDEB, aka, Butterfly skin. </p>
<p>The smallest irritation will cause her skin to blister and therefore she needs to have sterile bandages covering them all the time.</p>
<p>Her parents have to change those bandages for her daily because she is a baby. Would you be able to change your child's bandages while they cried in pain? </p>
<p>Can you imagine? I sure can't</p>
<p>Her mom writes a blog about it here: <a href=""http://brystalandeb.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://brystalandeb.blogspot.com/</a></p>
<p>You cannot read the entries without admiring her mom and her family for their good humor and coping skills.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What They Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Mom and Dad need to make sure that their daughter is always bandaged up so she can get on with being a happy little baby. They also need to be there for the other two kids. </p>
<p>This kind of constant medical care adds up fast, so let's help them out a little. At least during baby's first year, when it's one of the most formative years!</p>
<p>Any and all funds raised will go directly to the family along with a card from all of ""Us"".</p>
<p>They can use it to help defray some of the medical bills, and to buy medical supplies for Brystal. Hopefully they will also be able to buy something nice for the two older siblings!</p>
<p>It would just be nice to take a tiny bit of pressure off Mom and Dad so they can relax a little with their kids for a minute. </p>

<h2><strong>Hi my name is Justin Oien. I am a 17 year old road cyclist, and I race for the Monster Media/SC VELO p/b MRI Cycling Team. I have been selected by USA Cycling, the official governing body for all disciplines of competitive cycling in the United States, and responsible for identifying, training and selecting cyclist to represent the United States in international competition, .to race with the USAC Junior National Team. I will go first to Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec, Canada to participate in a prestigious 6 day-7 stage race called the Tour De L'Abitibi, where teams of 17 and 18 year olds from all over the world come to compete. Many of the best European junior development cycling programs bring their 17-18 year old teams to this race to test their mettle. After L'Abitibi, USA Cycling wants me to fly to Brussels, Belgium where they want me to train with the top USA Junior National Development Coaches and race for three weeks against the European juniors. The USA Cycling agenda has me “off racing” for a total of 34 days in Canada and Belgium.</strong></h2>
<h2>
<strong>The perspective of USA Cycling is that this is a development program to cultivate the future Olympic cyclists of the United States. It is essentially a training camp. America’s best coaches do the teaching, we, the junior riders are the students and do the training, and the Belgians provide the stiffest competition in the world. Cycling is the national pass-time of Belgium. As for the “training camp”, the travel, food and housing, and coaching etc. are not cheap or free. USA Cycling looks for talent and invites select riders. </strong><br/><strong>I am expected to come up with $1000 for housing, race entry fees , and the salaries of the coaches for L'Abitibi. I am also expected to get myself to Rouyn-Noranda so there is the airfare for $700. In addition, I also have to bring my own bike to L'Abitibi, so there is round-trip shipping of $300 for my bike.

<h3>A collection of semen-based recipes</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><span><strong>ABOUT THE PROJECT:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Semen is not only nutritious, but it also has a wonderful texture and amazing cooking properties. Like fine wine and cheeses, the taste of semen is complex and dynamic. Semen is inexpensive to produce and is commonly available in many, if not most, homes and restaurants. Despite all of these positive qualities, semen remains neglected as a food. </span></p>
<p><span>This series plans to change that. </span></p>
<p>Once you overcome any initial hesitation, you will be surprised to learn how wonderful semen is in the kitchen. Semen is an exciting ingredient that can give every dish you make an interesting twist. If you are a passionate cook and are not afraid to experiment with new ingredients - you will love this series!</p>
<p>Our sexy female host will show you how to create some of the tastiest dishes you’re mouth has ever experienced. With recipes ranging from appetizers like Slightly Saltier Caviar and Man Made Oysters to entrees like Tuna Sashimi with Homemade Dipping Sauce and Noodles with Special Spicy Sauce to deserts like Tiramisu Surprise and Spunky Candied Pecans, it has all the ""ingredients"" for a hugely successful series; just throw in a gorgeous and sexy chef in nothing but a kitchen apron and it will be a hit.</p>
<p>This project is a coming to life of the original book ""Natural Harvest"", a completely legitimate cook book with an interesting slant - all the recipes happen to have the ingredient of semen (most recipes require 1-3 tablespoons fresh semen).  The recipes are elegant and the photography sophisticated, and as hilariously funny as it is to bring out at parties, it is in fact a great collection of recipes.   </p>
<p>We have teamed up with the author to turn it into a series of episodes with a sexy yet sophisticated model as our host chef, and present the product to networks such as HBO2, Playboy, Spice, Vivid, etc., for broadcast.  We feel that the show would be a huge success, and news of such a show would spread virally across all platforms of media.</p>
<p>This specific fund-raising will provide a budget to complete a pilot presentation for network pitches.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><strong>ABOUT THE PRODUCERS:</strong></span></p>
<p>This series will be developed &amp; produced by professionals who work in the TV and Film business on a daily basis, who have won and been nominated for multiple awards, including Emmy Awards and Webby Awards, and the quality will equal that of any major network show.</p>

<p>Whether it is an infection, respiratory illness, or any of the hundred small illnesses that can turn deadly without proper care, the above life story is played out thousands of times unnecessarily on the remote islands of the South Pacific. But this time she will know that ""<em>Sea Mercy""</em> is coming on the horizon.</p>
<p><img alt=""Sea Mercy Target Region"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.seamercy.org/sites/default/files/Sea-Mercy-map-small_0.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Sea Mercy's target community in the South Pacific consists of 10 island nations with a combined population of 2.5 million people living on 2,500 islands spread across 8,000,000 square miles of ocean. These island nations are striving to build a modern health care infrastructure on their larger, primary islands. However, with no roads, power lines, or phone systems on the smaller, remote islands, those whom live on them will not have access to the same level of health care services that are being established on the main islands for five to ten years. This disconnect creates an incredible disparity in infant mortality rates, immunization rates, and a reduced health and longevity compared to those on the primary islands. The need is urgent and there is a solution, but it requires your help.</p>
<p>Sea Mercy (<a href=""http://www.seamercy.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.seamercy.org</a>) is a 501(c)3 non-profit charity that was created to ""stand in the gap"" for these remote islanders until their island nations' health care infrastructure can meet their needs. <strong>Sea Mercy </strong>is a <strong><em>Floating Health Care Clinic</em></strong> (FHCC) staffed by a continual rotation of volunteer doctors, dentists, nurses and staff who care enough to give of their time and lives to meet these needs.</p>

<h3><strong>President &amp; Founders</strong></h3>
<p>Richard and Stephanie Hackett, President and Founders of the <em>Sea Mercy Program </em>have spent over thirty years of their lives preparing to launch this important and much needed program. With successful profit and non-profit corporate experience, they bring a mature and tested leadership to the Sea Mercy organization (for a detailed bio <a href=""http://www.seamercy.org/node/1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Detail bio of Sea Mercy Leadership"">click here</a>).</p>
<h3><strong>Tasks Completed</strong></h3>

<li>501(c)3 status acquired</li>

<li>FHCC Vessel purchase commitment</li>
<li>Partnership with Medical Supplies source</li>
</ul><h3><strong>Our Current Need</strong></h3>
<p>Based on the Founders' prior experience in establishing and funding a non-profit organization, it takes a minimum of one year of dedicated efforts to achieve the necessary traction and approval with corporate and government funding sources. We have begun the submission process for grant and foundation funding to provide the financial support needed to operate a FHCC for 5+ years, but because the review and approval cycle can be one year or longer, this will require us to delay the launch of the program until 2014. <em><strong>Because this program is needed in 2013, this campaign is seeking to raise the minimum funds required to deliver and operate a Sea Mercy Floating Health Care Clinic for the first 12 months (the requested funding amount), for the Kingdom of Tonga.</strong> </em>We understand this is a large funding request, but all things are possible when we work together. We hope with your support we can delliver this much needed program in 2013.</p>
<p>All funds raised will focus on the following:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Floating Heal Care Clinic Operations  (62% of the budget)<br/></strong>Like a hospital or clinic, the operational costs of establishing and operating a facility is the greatest expense. The challenge for those in the South Pacific is that a hospital or health clinic cannot be built, supplied and staffed on every remote island. The most affordable way to meet those needs is through a Floating Health Care Clinic regularly visiting each remote island. The funds are used to ensure the safety and needs of our volunteers are being met while aboard the FHCC, that the FHCC is able to deliver those volunteers and supplies to the remote islands that we serve, and that our local island citizens are treated with the utmost care.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Medical Supplies (12% of the budget)<br/></strong>Without the medical supplies, the FHCC is just a floating advisory vessel, not a medical treatment clinic. Working with our medical supplies partner (MedShare), we will maintain a one year reserve of medical supplies stationed on our island nation partner to ensure that each rotation of health care volunteers are fully equipped to deliver the much needed health care services. Additional or excess supplies will be provided to our island partner for distribution to their local hospitals and health centers as needed.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Travel Expense Assistance for Volunteers (10% of the budget)<br/></strong>Although most of our short-term volunteers cover their own travel expenses, circumstances may require us to cover some of our ""emergency"" and/or ""specialists"" volunteer's travel expenses in order to maintain a fully staffed FHCC rotation due to last minute cancellations.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Island Nation Based Operations (9% of the budget)<br/></strong>Although a small percentage of our budget, our local medical supplies storage, resupply and distribution facility is crucial to our successful ongoing operations and maintaining effective communication with our island nation partner and local health care staff. This also includes key personnel to manage and direct the FHCC operations locally.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>US Based Operations (8% of the budget)<br/></strong>Although volunteers staff most of our US based operations, there are operational costs, legal fees, and personnel that require financial resources to operate. This includes the screening and selection of the volunteer health care staff for rotations on the FHCC (doctors, dentists, ophthalmologists, nurses, pharmacy technicians) </p>
<h3><strong>It Takes A Family...</strong></h3>
<p><img alt=""Kids at play on the islands"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.seamercy.org/sites/default/files/Children-small.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Support for Sea Mercy is already growing quickly as more and more people learn about our program and take on the dream themselves, but it will take a large family of volunteers and sponsors to connect our infrastructure and distribution system with all the people of the South Pacific. The Founders of Sea Mercy have committed to the purchase of the vessel for the Floating Health Care Clinic, once outside funding sources for Sea Mercy are able to support the day-to-day operations of the Sea Mercy program. Your support and financial assistance will expedite the implementation of this program in 2013 and through the life of the program.   </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>When surfing the internet looking for retreats for people who are ill and terminally ill we found very little for adults and their young families, most were especially for children. We found one trust which was specially aimed at adults but only if they met certain criteria for instance families on low incomes. All adults who suffer  cancers are all equal in my books and whether they are on a low or high income this suddenly stops when they are diagnosed but they still have bills, rent and mortgages to pay so they dont lose their homes. A holiday for most people is out of the question as money they do have coming in is spent on household bills and keeping a family. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>THE IMPACT</b><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<p>We would love to raise enough funds to buy or build a small villa or log cabin for patients to use free of charge with their familes in between treatments or after treatment. This would give people time to spend with their children and create happy memories. This will also give our family a project to focus on knowing we can help other people going through the trauma of diagnosis and give them something to look forward to during endless hospital visits and treatments.</p>
<p>Eventually we would like to have a retreat in north France so it is accessible via car and ferry as well as the Euro tunnel. Also secondary to this we would also like to have one in the the Scottish Borders which would be quite central for all in the uk with gorgeous surroundings.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What we need to get started is enough cash to buy a small piece of land in the borders or North Scotland and start raising funds for the build. If our aim is not met we will continue fundraising until we have enough. We can buy land to build a log cabin on for around 40 000. We aim to raise the rest by fundraising campaigns.</p>
<p>We really need your help. I promise to keep you updated on our progress.<br/></p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

Over the years, Inspired would go on to create the #1 pre-workout in the sports nutrition industry, DVST8. The base of Inspired Nutraceuticals was built on the concept of providing the best supplements and formulas for their athletes and customers. Working with athletes revealed that there was a gap in cognitive advancement, there was not a solid replacement for crash-inducing energy drinks or an alternative to something you buy from a pharmacist. And Anastasis was born.   Corporate CEOs, real estate moguls, Wall Street heavyweights, and straight A students -- all highly successful individuals -- share a set of common traits: 
Relentless work ethic
Uncompromising standards
Laser focus
Dogged determination
Clear, defined vision
Unyielding commitment
Endless pursuit of excellence

<h3>A Message from Sima's Mother</h3>
<p>I received this email just today with a message from Sima's mother  and I would like to share part of it with you. (It has been translated from Russian.)</p>
<p><i>      <b>I can cry and wonder why and for what reason G-d gave me a special child.</b> I can lay down my hands and do nothing; just feel sorry for myself and hide this unusual baby from friends and neighbors, not talk about it to friend and family. I can cry at night and think about how I'm out of luck....</i></p>
<p><i>      But, for what?? This is the question that I must ask myself. <b>Why should I make life unbearable when I can just learn to live a new life</b>, one that was unknown until now, a complex, difficult, but interesting life, with the opportunity to make new discoveries, and follow a path upon which I will meet a lot of new, interesting, good, smart people who will understand me?...</i></p>
<p><i>       I chose this path and along the way, I have met so many nice people that I would not have met had fate not allowed me to become the mother of a special child. And I believe and <b>I hope that the people I have met will become my friends and that we will go hand in hand together, in our new life.</b></i></p>
<p>Anna, Sima's mother, goes on to outline what their routine has been until now and describes the various procedures and difficulties Sima has had so far. </p>
<p><i>       ....<b>The bill came and I am at a complete loss.</b> I really hope that I have the strength to overcome it all. And to deal with the collection of the money. Sorry that this letter is long, but, well, this is really what happened. Thank you all in advance.</i></p>

Sima was born prematurely on February 25, 2103. She  was born with Down's Syndrome and a host of other health issues including a heart defect. The first few months of Sima's life, when most parents are bonding with their new baby and learning what makes their child cry and what makes their child laugh, Sima's parents were in and out of the hospital, visiting doctors and providing Sima with the drugs she needed to live. 
At 6 months, Sima is now at the point where she needs to have open heart surgery in order to correct the defect she was born with. As a growing baby, it is important that this operation be taken care of sooner rather than later, before it can get any worse.
Sima will be traveling with her parents from Russia to Germany where the doctors are equipped to give her the help she needs and to perform the surgery. However, the costs are exorbitant and Sima's parents have no idea where they will come up with the money they need to help save Sima's heart. 
As a family friend, I appeal to you, and ask you to open up your heart and save Sima's. Every dollar will go a long way to a family that simply doesn't have any. Imagine if Sima was your daughter, your niece, your cousin - how would you react then? 
I don't have any major perks I can think of offering, but I hope that regardless, you will show compassion and love to a young, innocent baby who is just beginning her life in this world.

<p>We believe HerbiCube to be the world's most advanced and practical indoor garden. (we call him Herbie)</p>
<p>It is an automated growing system that let's even brown thumbs grow food right where you want it - right there in the kitchen. Being a soil based system it can be fully organic, or you can use chemically based nutrients if that is your preference - it is your choice.</p>
<p>It is the best way to grow herbs, salad greens and small fruits and vegetables like strawberries or cherry tomatoes.</p>
<p>Herbie's inventor, David Copping, has spent the last 4 years working on better ways to grow food. One of his big ideas is a revolutionary vertical growing system that could help feed the world's undernourished millions. Developing and marketing the HerbiCube organic indoor garden is one of the ways to help bring this dream into reality.</p>
<p>Help is needed for tooling and initial inventory to get Herbie away from the computer and out into the real world. Prototypes have been trialled with distributors around the world and final design changes made. Now we're ready for tooling and production!</p>
<h3>Why Buy a HerbiCube?</h3>
<p>We've got three words for you - taste, nutrition and convenience. Arrange them in any order you want - they're all there!</p>
<p>If you like cooking, you will know all about the taste difference between fresh and dried herbs. And how many times have you bought expensive parsely or basil at the market and ended up with half of it spoiling in the refrigerator? </p>
<p>Of course the better taste also indicates how much more nutritious fresh product is - it hasn't suffered through days (or weeks) in the supply chain, or been bombarded with chemical sprays or fertilisers. With HerbiCube - its all natural, fully organic.</p>
<p>The convenience of having the fresh herbs and salad greens you use right there on your kitchen bench is just fantastic. No getting wet in the rain when you need something from the garden.</p>
<p>There are other advantages to growing food indoors - it means you can grow all year round, weather extremes like really hot or cold days don't damage the plants, and of course, there are no bugs eating your precious crop.</p>
<p>It's also perfect for apartment dwellers.</p>
<h3><strong> What's So Special About Herbie?</strong></h3>
<p> Herbie has got a lot going for him, and your help will allow many more people to enjoy the real taste of fresh herbs and salad greens, growing right where you need them - on your kitchen bench.</p>
<p>Here are some of Herbie's good bits: </p>
<ul>
<li>hi-tech lights assist plant growth, health and taste (with low energy LED's your power bills are lower as is your greenhouse footprint and there's no risk of burning your precious plants);</li>
<li>completely organic (no chemical nutrients);</li>
<li>compact design (250mm x 250mm) with a unique rotating base for easy plant maintenance and cropping;</li>
<li>automated - just set and forget watering, light and nutrient delivery regimes.</li>
<li>lower plant costs and choice - you will have the choice of buying either our specially formulated soils and nutrients, as well as convenient seed packs, but if you prefer, you can just trot down to your local garden centre and buy all the gear you need there.</li>
</ul><h3><strong>Help Needed</strong></h3>
<p>We're asking for your help by pre-purchasing some product to help us get it into production. We're offering great discounts, and the more you buy, the more you save. it's a terrific gift idea, and even works as a community project (volume discounts mean you can resell them as a fund-raiser!)</p>
<div>
<p>We have an Indiegogo target of only $20,000, which helps us with our initial manufacturing run. We also been undertaking a more traditional equity capital raising and have nearly raised enough to meet our minimum production. $20,000 from you guys will get us over the line, so please help.</p>
<p>You can email David Copping at <a href=""mailto:dcopping@indoorgardencompany.com.au"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">dcopping@indoorgardencompany.com.au</a> for more detail on our capital raising if you are interested.</p>
<p>We have distributors lined up all around the world who have seen our early prototype and are waiting to see the final finished product (it has many design improvements on the version they were enthusiastic about), so we are looking forward to being able to give them better suppoprt and to start work on developing our other products.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't buy a HerbiCube you can still help us by sharing this with friends, family, even foes, we're not fussed, just help us get it out there!</p>

It is awe inspiring to see the transformations our clients have gone through, we have dedicated ourselves to helping others reach their goals and the rewards are amazing.
Our campaign here on IndieGoGo is to fund a rezoning application that our city requires in order for us to operate at our current location. 
Fitness and nutrition is a passion that we both share and our gift is giving that to others, we need this rezoning to go through because without it we would have to move our gym and as a young married couple who just started their careers we can't afford the move our business.
   What We Need & What You Get

We need $2,500+GST for the application itself, plus another another $300 for the signage and other associated costs.

In exchange for helping us with the rezoning application contributors will be able to take advantage of some discounted services that we offer, as well as pick up some super-awesome Primal Athletics swag that is guaranteed to make you look cooler!

    The Impact

Rebecca and I were both athletes growing up, and as much training as we did for our sports neither one of us had a Strength and Conditioning coach to help us with our weaknesses. 

We want to be that missing link for the City of Campbell River, the one that allows for kids to reach their full potential as athletes and make something of themselves. 


Of course we have a large population of adult clients and we love helping them get the results that they are after but giving someone a chance to succeed in their dreams is a goal that we both share.

We are working hard to educate people of all ages on the importance of moving their bodies and doing it properly. Our goal, for every single person is to understand best practices behind movement and how to go about maintaining themselves.

starting each day with your feet up. It raises your awareness to a major health
issues like Bowel Cancer, its unique

<p><b>Who is Jen?</b></p><p>Jen Sackley is the inventor of Jenspoowezy
Product; she is an original thinker, leader, a creative entrepreneur and
life changer. She uses scientifically based theories that support positive
human behavioral change.</p><p>
</p><p>She is the founder of Sackley Holdings Pty Ltd
which has a single focus: to help individuals, create motivational change so
that they can create vibrant lives with a sense of well being, purpose and
productivity.</p>
<br/><p><b>Why will this work when others have not? </b></p>
<p>Because there has never been a Jenspoowezy before, it
is the world’s first. Furthermore with Bowel Cancer noted as responsible for
affecting the health of 1 in every 3 persons in Australia each year the time is
right. Jenspoowezy believes that this innovative product with your campaign
support has the potential to revolutionize the way people think and practice
their daily toileting habits.</p>
<p>There is no doubt in Jens mind Jenspoowezy’s impact
when supported correctly may be equal to the impact initially created by the introduction
of the toothbrush. </p>
<p><i>Having your
support on this campaign means this product will be developed on Jens watch, guaranteed
to retain its integrity in every stage of production. </i></p>
<p><b>Our Story, a product originally specifically designed for Jen. Now Jen
wants you to have it too.</b></p>
<p>After suffering a workplace injury Jen found she could

Jenspoowezy
is a revolutionary new health product specifically designed to assist you with
starting each day with your feet up. It raises your awareness to a major health
issues like Bowel Cancer, its unique
design recognizes that a person’s innate recuperative power is controlled by the
nervous system and that there is a direct relationship between structural and
neurological function. And through its daily practice its builds
strong mussel memory that may aid and benefit you throughout your lifetime. 
Who is Jen?Jen Sackley is the inventor of Jenspoowezy
Product; she is an original thinker, leader, a creative entrepreneur and
life changer. She uses scientifically based theories that support positive
human behavioral change.
She is the founder of Sackley Holdings Pty Ltd
which has a single focus: to help individuals, create motivational change so
that they can create vibrant lives with a sense of well being, purpose and
productivity.
Why will this work when others have not? 
Because there has never been a Jenspoowezy before, it
is the world’s first. Furthermore with Bowel Cancer noted as responsible for
affecting the health of 1 in every 3 persons in Australia each year the time is
right. Jenspoowezy believes that this innovative product with your campaign
support has the potential to revolutionize the way people think and practice
their daily toileting habits.
There is no doubt in Jens mind Jenspoowezy’s impact
when supported correctly may be equal to the impact initially created by the introduction
of the toothbrush. 
Having your
support on this campaign means this product will be developed on Jens watch, guaranteed
to retain its integrity in every stage of production. 
Our Story, a product originally specifically designed for Jen. Now Jen
wants you to have it too.
After suffering a workplace injury Jen found she could
not toilet herself like before. It was recommended medically to Jen she adopt
the correct position.
What’s that you ask? Most people don’t know and those that have
heard don’t practice it as there is no Jenspoowezy out there.
When Jen suffered she looked everywhere for a toiletry
footrest, there were some products that were just not correct, some that were
not comfortable to use especially if one is aging but most of all not one other
product was designed to support and stimulate the feet correctly.
So with this in mind contributions and discussions with
both Jens Doctors and health providers, a designer cabinet maker was sort. Jenspoowezy was created in timber and finished
with a lovely polish. It suited Jens
bathroom it was discreet easy to keep clean etc. 
You’re Campaign

Jen needs your support to bring this product to market. 
1.  It needs to be reproduced in a

timber product so to assist with cost such as (P&H)
3.  It needs to meet customs requirements

4.  It needs to be flat-packed so were

5.  Last but not least by making the

6.  Once flat-packed retailers and pharmacies
will be able to stock and promote the product.

<h3>A Truly Integral Space for a Community that Keeps Waking-Up and Growing-Up in Service of a Better World</h3>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>
<p>Our community was started by people who care deeply about connection and relationship--as a path to better lives, and ultimately to inspiring a healthier world. It's a radically simple view: more loving people create more loving families and neighbors, which creates more loving communities, more loving cities, and ultimately a more loving world.  <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">It may sound simple, but like most essential truths it's not as easy as it sounds and relationship is the place where our least loving and aware tendencies get highlighted *fast*.</span></p>
<p><b>Who We Are</b></p>
<p>The Integral Center is a community of people engaging practices that focus on our relationships with each other. Our belief is that when we learn to really connect with others, beyond our stories, fears, withholds, projections, and judgements--magic happens.<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">  When our teachers, social workers, and all those people most susceptible to 'compassion fatigue', get a weekend with us to hit the reset button (by donation), they're often recharged and ready to go back out in the trenches, with all their unique specialties, to do what most needs to be done.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">This community has grown from a vision and people practicing in their own living rooms to a fully organized center, with weekend-long intensives, training programs, game nights, and open-door practices for anyone interested in taking a deeper dive into their community (and themselves). Our members include entrepreneurs and healers, artists and students, business leaders and entire families.<br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>Why We Need Your Help</b></span></p></span><p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We were one and a half years into our lease when we got hit hard by the epic Colorado floods in September. The pipes in our building backed up and filled our first level (7000 square feet, half of our entire space) with toxic water and sewage. The water destroyed all the flooring, carpeting, furnishings, plumbing, boiler and other property on that level. To make things more complicated, our insurance policies denied us without even looking and forced us into a back and forth battle with no end in sight.<br/><br/></span></p>

Our community was started by people who care deeply about connection and relationship--as a path to better lives, and ultimately to inspiring a healthier world. It's a radically simple view: more loving people create more loving families and neighbors, which creates more loving communities, more loving cities, and ultimately a more loving world.  It may sound simple, but like most essential truths it's not as easy as it sounds and relationship is the place where our least loving and aware tendencies get highlighted *fast*.
Who We Are
The Integral Center is a community of people engaging practices that focus on our relationships with each other. Our belief is that when we learn to really connect with others, beyond our stories, fears, withholds, projections, and judgements--magic happens.  When our teachers, social workers, and all those people most susceptible to 'compassion fatigue', get a weekend with us to hit the reset button (by donation), they're often recharged and ready to go back out in the trenches, with all their unique specialties, to do what most needs to be done.
This community has grown from a vision and people practicing in their own living rooms to a fully organized center, with weekend-long intensives, training programs, game nights, and open-door practices for anyone interested in taking a deeper dive into their community (and themselves). Our members include entrepreneurs and healers, artists and students, business leaders and entire families.
Why We Need Your Help

We were one and a half years into our lease when we got hit hard by the epic Colorado floods in September. The pipes in our building backed up and filled our first level (7000 square feet, half of our entire space) with toxic water and sewage. The water destroyed all the flooring, carpeting, furnishings, plumbing, boiler and other property on that level. To make things more complicated, our insurance policies denied us without even looking and forced us into a back and forth battle with no end in sight.
    

    
The Truth Revealed in CrisisImmediately following this historic natural disaster, we were flooded with support from our members and friends with hundreds of hours of help removing the sewage-soaked carpet, furniture, and a lot more.  So much so that the building owner and mitigation crew were astounded by the response.  We kept hearing, ""I've never seen anything like this before..."" referring to the quantity and quality of support that was showing-up to roll-up their sleeves and get messy to help the recovery of this beloved space dedicated to gathering and growth.  This was evidence to all that we truly have something special here that many care about a LOT. But shovels and strong arms can only do so much. The building sustained damages in the 6-figures, and our entire ground floor will need to be rebuilt, from the floors up. We need your help so we can reconstruct our building and bring ourselves into even deeper relationship with our space and each other.Community Reconstruction for New Services and Outreach
If we meet our goal, we'll have the funds we need to support a community rebuild that will not only renew our space, but also bring us into deeper relationship with the building, each other, and the greater community as we ask for support and share what we care about.Our fundraising priorities cover the following reconstruction activities:

Rebuilding three bathrooms that were destroyed


Flooring/Carpeting over 4000 square feet of stairs and floors


Reflooring our 1500 square foot dance/embodiment studio

Reframing and hanging new drywall in at least seven rooms
Building-out new rooms that will provide office space for members and community events

Rebuilding our kitchen with flooring, cabinets and counters

Furniture to replace what was destroyed
And if we surpass our base, our stretch goals include:
A new bathroom and shower for our west side
Rebuilding our video studio
Additional staff resources to help us further organize and optimize our offerings
An outdoor patio (that Jeff was planning on adding before the flood hit)
Why it Matters: Our Vision and Our Greater Global CommunityThrough this campaign, we're excited to share the principles and vision of our practice-based community.  It's all rooted in Integral Philosophy--based on the work of author and philosopher Ken Wilber, and the work of the Integral Institute community.Integral theory is an all-inclusive framework that draws on the key insights of the world’s greatest knowledge traditions. The awareness gained from drawing on all truths and perspectives allows the Integral thinker to bring new depth, clarity and compassion to every level of human endeavor — from unlocking individual potential to finding new approaches to global-scale problems.Through the course of this campaign, we'll be updating backers with interviews with some of our most prominent community members and teachers talking about our core principles and vision for how we want to live better lives and be of greater service to the world.Topics we'll be covering in the interviews:

How a more Integral view can support all aspects of your life

Community as the New Currency
Circling: the Integral relational practice for deeper understaning of self and other
Relationship as a Path
Best Practices for Better Relationships
The Integral Story and Vision
The Importance of Practice for Individual and Community Development

<p>Hello Everybody!</p>
<p>     I am Emily, and am a Licensed Massage Therapist (LMT) in the great state of Illinois.  I am enthralled to work and grow as a therapist and practice in my state and community. In 2002 I attended massage therapy school at an academy in Phoenix, AZ.  Graduating at the top of my class in 2003 I aspired for more. </p>
<p>Since this time, I have passed the National Certification Board of Massage Therapy exam to practice in state and am working on my National Certification in Massage Therapy and Body Work to gain accreditation nationally.  I have also trained in a variety of continuing education courses around the country, and continue to extend my knowledge base, indefinitely.  </p>
<p>So, why am I doing this campaign.  Well, to put it straight I have worked so very hard to get to this point.  10 years ago the laws started to change for massage therapists and since I choose to come back home to Illinois I was no longer grandfathered into a license.  Self-study and determination is all I had and have to uphold the highest standard in this field.  In essence I am thankful that I have had to go down this road as it has only made me exceed my own expectations.  There has been much sacrifice to this point and now I need to hit the ground running.  This isn't another thing to wait on.  The need to get started now goes above and beyond my wants and needs.  Therefore, I am here.</p>
<p>The fund goal to be raised will go towards everything from insurance, studio rent, advertising, table, products, etc.  This is the minimum budget for a therapist to get a base foundation.  The perks that are being offered, in return, are better than what I will be offering for first time clients.  So, there are definite benefits to helping out.  Anything raised above my goal will be put aside for my future aspirations.  </p>
<p> I am developing a life long project of integrating another passion of mine, bringing family and community connection, into my therapy base.  The aspiration is to bring affordable yet diverse body work therapy into the lives of all individuals and families as a whole. </p>
<p>Awareness, education, and hands on is a foundation that I believe I can accomplish this integration with.  I hope to bring to light, providing all 3 of these elements to my clients every session, the foundation that our means of vitality starts with One, and with One change comes Another, and so forth.  The vision is you, your partner/spouse, your child/children, your family, your community, and so forth.</p>
<p>As things grow there will be different programs to take advantage of as a client.  More ways to become involved in a long term dedication to your health and others around you such as workshops, products, connections, and financial assistance for therapy.  These being only a few of many long-term goals.</p>

Meet Ubaldo (the one in the picture), a a ten year old Mexican boy. He weights 76,6 kilos with a height of 145 centimeters.

Ubaldo is one of thousands of children facing problems like this not only in Mexico but in the whole world. 
I am a doctoral researcher and this is my topic. My goal is to provide solutions to avoid unnecessary deaths at young ages. My target population are children. 
Children are the most vulnerable individuals to publicity and marketing strategies, since they cannot really tell the difference between reality and publicity and they don't have a strong capacity of changing their environments. 
They are constantly bombarded by marketing professionals selling them unhealthy products so why not to use these same proven strategies  to promote a healthier nutrition? This project aims to show the children and their parents that plain water flavored with natural fruits and herbs is not only healthy but also delicious, easy to prepare and visually attractive. This strategy is holistic, involving parents, schools and other stakeholders.

This picture was taken by Bénédicte Desrus in a mexican hospital, please refer to the acknowledgment below for more details about the picture case. Thanks Bénédicte for allowing me use this picture!
So, I made a team of people concerned with this topic and we designed a social marketing intervention trying to make an impact in children so they quit sugary drinks and change them for naturally flavored water. This would reduce their likelihood to develop diabetes type II in more than 80%

What We Need & What You Get
 We want to create a module were children can taste this water, learn how to prepare it, propose their own mixes and exchange their sugary drinks for portable difusors so they can have always this kind of water with them. They will receive also flyers to take home with information for their parents and super easy instructions for improving nutrition at home.

</div><h1><span>Running Is Not Supposed To Be Bad For You.</span></h1><p>Every year 50-80% of runners are injured. That's a well-known statistic, one you've probably heard before. </p><p>Behind those numbers, what does the day-to-day reality actually look like?</p><ul>
<li><p>A person whose New Year's resolution was to start running. On January 1 their first run feels awful but they feel proud they did it, and believe it will feel better as they get fitter. On February 1 it still feels awful. On March 1 they're not running any more.</p></li>
<li><p>A runner who wants to try a marathon but can't ever seem to run more than 7 miles without knee pain.</p></li>
<li><p>A runner training for a marathon, hoping to set a new personal best, only to break down after an 18-miler and never make it to the starting line.</p></li>
<li><p>A runner who loves training with a club – having goals, structure, feedback, and the encouragement of teammates -- but frequently struggles with injury, missing workouts, races... and friends.</p></li>
<li><p>A lifelong runner who holds their body together with stretching, foam rolling, Pilates, sports massage, and visits to the physio, allowing them to train hard, race hard and occasionally sets PRs. But on the way to work in the morning they can't break into a run to catch a bus because it hurts too much.</p></li>
</ul><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452031666/fcigopi21pv4oyjxuvm5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>The flip side of those stories is the smaller percentage of runners who have a very different experience:</b></p><ul>
<li><p>Looking forward to every run because of how great it feels.</p></li>
<li><p>Easily increasing the length of runs without pain or injury</p></li>
<li><p>Arriving healthy at the starting line of a goal race and setting a PB with a smile</p></li>
<li><p>Training steadily with a club and being there to help teammates run better as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Recovering the joy, freedom, and spontaneity of running as a child, breaking easily into a run to catch a bus or race a grandchild.</p></li>
</ul><p>Runners in the first group, working hard to take care of their bodies and cultivate their health and wellbeing, often think those in the second group are just lucky – born healthier or more biomechanically gifted than everyone else.</p><p>But no one was born knowing how to run. Every one of us learned how.</p><p>And while there are many factors involved in staying healthy and running well, learning is the only one that can make you feel fast, free, and a little like you're flying. Running, that is, like you were born to.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452049954/mgygiyz0ideyuhjh52ri.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 40px; background-color: initial;"">The Discovery</span><br/></p><p>I'm not a coach or sports scientist. My background is in professional dance, so when I struggled to run, I did what dancers do: I looked for problems with my technique and started working on them.  </p><p>That was in 2001, long before the book ""Born to Run"" sparked the barefoot/minimalist running movement and raised interest in working on running form (or technique). So I didn't have much to go on. But I did have a powerful tool to help me: the <i>Feldenkrais Method of Movement Education</i>.</p><p>The <i>Feldenkrais Method</i> was developed by Moshe Feldenkrais, D.Sc., beginning in the 1950s to help people learn how to move and function better. Not just a sports-training method, it's known for helping people with serious challenges, such as cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, and strokes, and even can be used to help animals. It allows people to dramatically improve how they move safely and without stress.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452133903/uc3q8ufkdns8aoneypyv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div>
<p>As I was studying to become a <i>Feldenkrais</i> practitioner, I was able to use the method to make dramatic changes in how I ran until it felt fantastic. In fact it felt better than dancing and I decided to make the switch.</p>
<p>I also realized that the things I'd discovered were critical to running the way nature intended were things nobody else was talking about, let alone teaching effectively. That's when The Balanced Runner was born.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Since then, along with two Feldenkrais practitioners I’ve trained, I have helped hundreds of runners one-to-one and in workshops, and countless others via my <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLPrb1CfaQn3KVlytqIlJpQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">YouTube</a> channel, <a href=""http://www.balancedrunner.com/work-with-us/online-training-camps/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">online courses</a>, and <a href=""http://www.balancedrunner.com/blog/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">my blog</a>. </p>But it isn't even a drop in the bucket.

<h1>FAQ</h1>
<p><b><i>How is this approach different from doing stretches or strength training or core stability exercises?</i></b></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Most physical therapists and fitness professionals recommend exercise to help runners improve their technique. However stretches, Pilates, etc., may change your strength or flexibility but they don't help you learn how to move better. That process, called “motor learning,” requires a combination of exploration and feedback that's missing from most exercise.</span></p>
<p>The fact is, your flexibility and mobility are determined by your nervous system, which is constantly making decisions about how much to lengthen or shorten your muscles and how to coordinate your movement, and this determines which muscles get strong when you run. That process of making decisions and coordinating your movement is what needs to be improved to help you run better, and this will result in better flexibility, mobility, and strength... not the other way around.</p>
<p>Strengthening and flexibility exercises can be good cross-training for runners provided they're done correctly, but they just don't make a big enough difference in running technique.</p>
<p><b><i>How is this different from running technique drills and cues?</i></b></p>
<p>As with exercise, drills and cues lack the exploration and feedback features required for learning. They aren't harmful but they lack the power to make significant changes in how you run.</p>
<p><b><i>Won't the right shoes and/or orthotics solve most problems?</i></b></p>
<p>The American College of Sports Medicine – the largest and most respected advisory organization on health and fitness in the US – says they will not. Their <a href=""http://www.acsm.org/docs/brochures/running-shoes.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">current guidelines</a> state, ""<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">A running shoe should protect the feet </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">against injury, but should not do the work of
the foot by providing excessive cushioning and lots of extra support in the arch. A shoe
should complement a strong foot."" </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Based on a thorough review of the existing research on running shoes, the ACSM recommends you avoid shoes with motion control or stability components, as well as extra arch support inserts or store-based orthotics because they interfere with normal foot motion. ""</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Orthotics should be considered temporary
fixes (&lt;6-8 weeks)..."" </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In other words, you should not depend on your footwear to be an ongoing solution for running-related problems. </span></p>

<p><b><i>Won't switching to minimalist footwear or barefoot running solve most problems?</i></b></p>
<p>Many people feel it does, though research is not conclusive at this point. However, most experts recommend you transition gradually from conventional running shoes to minimalist or barefoot running, and as part of your transition you work on your running form. So changing your type of footwear still means you need an effective method for learning better running technique.</p>
<p><b><i>How is this different from other running technique programs, such as ChiRunning, Pose Method, etc.?</i></b></p>
<p>The Balanced Runner is the only company using an effective scientifically-based motor-learning method to help runners improve their technique. Other methods depend primarily on drills, cues, and exercises to help runners change their technique, and thus are less effective for the reasons listed above.</p>
<p><b><i>What's your proof?</i></b></p>
<p>The Balanced Runner has a 12 year track record of success. Clients regularly set new personal bests shortly after beginning to work with us and experience their pain fading away, all more rapidly than training or healing could bring about. </p>
<p>Research into the Feldenkrais Method includes <a href=""http://ptjournal.apta.org/content/86/12/1641.full"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this study</a> showing the method lengthens hamstrings without stretching and <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20070145"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this one</a> that shows it improves balance and balance confidence in the elderly. However to date there are no studies into the use of the method to help runners or to understand the specific running technique changes that come about. Such studies are expensive, and initiating the process is a stretch goal for this campaign.</p>

</div></div>","Running Is Not Supposed To Be Bad For You.Every year 50-80% of runners are injured. That's a well-known statistic, one you've probably heard before. Behind those numbers, what does the day-to-day reality actually look like?
A person whose New Year's resolution was to start running. On January 1 their first run feels awful but they feel proud they did it, and believe it will feel better as they get fitter. On February 1 it still feels awful. On March 1 they're not running any more.
A runner who wants to try a marathon but can't ever seem to run more than 7 miles without knee pain.
A runner training for a marathon, hoping to set a new personal best, only to break down after an 18-miler and never make it to the starting line.
A runner who loves training with a club – having goals, structure, feedback, and the encouragement of teammates -- but frequently struggles with injury, missing workouts, races... and friends.
A lifelong runner who holds their body together with stretching, foam rolling, Pilates, sports massage, and visits to the physio, allowing them to train hard, race hard and occasionally sets PRs. But on the way to work in the morning they can't break into a run to catch a bus because it hurts too much.
The flip side of those stories is the smaller percentage of runners who have a very different experience:
Looking forward to every run because of how great it feels.
Easily increasing the length of runs without pain or injury
Arriving healthy at the starting line of a goal race and setting a PB with a smile
Training steadily with a club and being there to help teammates run better as well.
Recovering the joy, freedom, and spontaneity of running as a child, breaking easily into a run to catch a bus or race a grandchild.
Runners in the first group, working hard to take care of their bodies and cultivate their health and wellbeing, often think those in the second group are just lucky – born healthier or more biomechanically gifted than everyone else.But no one was born knowing how to run. Every one of us learned how.And while there are many factors involved in staying healthy and running well, learning is the only one that can make you feel fast, free, and a little like you're flying. Running, that is, like you were born to.The DiscoveryI'm not a coach or sports scientist. My background is in professional dance, so when I struggled to run, I did what dancers do: I looked for problems with my technique and started working on them.  That was in 2001, long before the book ""Born to Run"" sparked the barefoot/minimalist running movement and raised interest in working on running form (or technique). So I didn't have much to go on. But I did have a powerful tool to help me: the Feldenkrais Method of Movement Education.The Feldenkrais Method was developed by Moshe Feldenkrais, D.Sc., beginning in the 1950s to help people learn how to move and function better. Not just a sports-training method, it's known for helping people with serious challenges, such as cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, and strokes, and even can be used to help animals. It allows people to dramatically improve how they move safely and without stress.
As I was studying to become a Feldenkrais practitioner, I was able to use the method to make dramatic changes in how I ran until it felt fantastic. In fact it felt better than dancing and I decided to make the switch.
I also realized that the things I'd discovered were critical to running the way nature intended were things nobody else was talking about, let alone teaching effectively. That's when The Balanced Runner was born.


Since then, along with two Feldenkrais practitioners I’ve trained, I have helped hundreds of runners one-to-one and in workshops, and countless others via my YouTube channel, online courses, and my blog. But it isn't even a drop in the bucket. And running technique education, though much more popular now than in 2001, hasn't improved nearly enough. This means huge numbers of runners are getting hurt and frustrated unnecessarily every year – some even to the point of giving up their efforts to be physically active, despite all we know about the tragic effects of a sedentary lifestyle.Even more significantly, it means countless runners every year trying and failing to connect to this most basic human action, this powerful, natural means of cultivating our best selves in body and mind and deepening our relationship with the beautiful world we live in.


I want to help more runners. I believe it’s time for the Feldenkrais Method to become part of the mainstream, so that every runner who needs help will hear about it and be able to use it.
I can do that by massively expanding my online offerings and training running-related professionals to use what I’ve discovered. But to do that I need administrative and IT staff.  The goal of this campaign is to raise the funds to hire them.

<h3><strong>Side effect: Weight loss<br/></strong></h3>
<p>When we enrolled 100 overweight and obese people into a clinical study, ""The chronic health project"", it was NOT ABOUT WEIGHT LOSS.  These guys had focused for years on losing weight and never did (not for long, at least). Now they found themselves dropping their dress size while they actually pursued something else:</p>
<h3><strong>An individualized path to chronic health and functional longevity.</strong></h3>
<p>So we investigated why. And we made an amazing discovery: the human ability to<strong> master a 6th sense for calorie balance</strong>. Training it was a side effect of our study intervention.</p>
<p>Now we want to bring that side effect to everybody. With<strong> a GPS for chronic health</strong>. Globally available like the GPS you use in your car. Only with a different purpose: to create the first epidemic that everyone would like to have - the epidemic of chronic health and waist reduction.</p>
<p>The prototype GPS is ready for our contributors to try out its first feature: training a 6th sense for calorie balance. Your contributions will help us to improve the design and to translate our research results into the add-ons for chronic health and longevity. For everybody.</p>

As our study participants realized, on the path to chronic health and longevity weight loss is a side effect. But that's a good one, for two reasons: (a) most people desire it and (b) overweight has already become the single largest cause of avoidable disease and death. That's why we made training a<strong> 6th sense for calorie balance</strong> the ELF's first feature.</p>

<h3><strong><br/></strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Why do we need your financial support?</strong></h3>
<p>Because we are about $37,000.- short of developing our tool into a ""Global <strong><em>health</em></strong> Positioning System -- G<strong>h</strong>PS"".</p>
<p>As health scientists <strong>we have spent our own money over the past 4 years to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>set up and run adiphea's health lab</li>
<li>do the basic clinical research on how to make people achieve chronic health</li>
<li>translate our findings into the first testable application</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other ways you can help</h3>
<p>We are really grateful for every kind of support, not only the financial sort. It would help us greatly to <strong>get the word out about our project.</strong> For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>to your employer</strong>: to use the ELF in a pilot corporate health project, for example. We are ready to go all the way with him.</li>
<li>
<strong>to your fitness club:</strong> they might want to introduce it to their members</li>
<li>
<strong>to your newspaper editor</strong>: for being the first to talk ""chronic health""</li>
<li>
<strong>to your congress (wo-)man</strong>: chronic health is a subject of national importance</li>
<li>
<strong>to your health insurance company</strong>: they definitely love healthy policy holders</li>
<li>
<strong>to Oprah Winfrey</strong>: she might just give the ""side effect"" a try</li>
<li>
<strong>to your friends and family</strong>: for the same reason</li>
<li>
<strong>maybe not to your mother-in-law</strong>: or are you implying that she is fat?</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong><strong><br/></strong></strong></h3>
<h3><strong><strong>What will we do with your support?</strong> </strong></h3>
<p>First off, we strongly believe in reciprocity: if we receive something valuable, <strong>we give something valuable in return</strong>. Which is why we wanted to have a testable prototype when we go asking for investments. We let our contributors use this prototype for one year for free. We also offer a few other perks which are not usually available. Now, let us tell you what your contributions will be spent on:</p>
<p><strong>I.     </strong><strong>Phase 1 (target completion: 31. July 2012): from prototype to product </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>building the ""Wow"" into the web delivery of the ELF</strong> ($ 9,500.-): You'll see that the ELF works, but you'll also see that it needs some serious face lifting. The $ 9,500 go to the creative people who make the design and to the IT people who translate that design into a web application which keeps its users attracted to staying the course towards chronic health.</li>
<li>
<strong>Upgrading the server</strong> to accommodate the expected traffic increase ($ 1,500.-): We have been running the ELF as a sideshow on one of our partner's private virtual server. For the expected increase in user traffic, this temporary solution is seriously underpowered. So we need to migrate the ELF to its own dedicated server.</li>
<li>
<strong>developing algorithms</strong> for medium-term and lifetime risk profiling ($ 3,000.-) from users' individual medical and physiological data: you have probably heard about risk scores for heart disease and diabetes. The problem is that they are too myopic, too much focused on the next 10 years and therefore missing out on real lifetime risk. Which is what we want to remedy. That requires analyses of published and  unpublished research data, and the translation of these data into algorithms which let the ELF calculate your true lifetime health and risk profile. I'll write more on this subject in the updates to this campaign.</li>
<li>
<strong>Improving the training algorithm</strong> for the 6th sense tool ($ 3,000.-): The purpose of this algorithm is to detect whether your 6th sense is really developing or whether you are just guessing right by chance. While the algorithm is good, we have some ideas about making it more sensitive. And we need to check out this idea in real subjects.</li>
<li>
<strong>Buying MatLab Software</strong> ($ 4,000.-) to do all the algorithm developments: MatLab software is the math software which we need to work our algorithms and to evaluate the data from physiological measurements done on our study subjects. Until now we have been piggybacking on the academic resources of one of our collaborators. But we want to find ourselves back on the right side of the copyright laws. Which is why we have to make the expense.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>     II.     </strong><strong>Phase 2: </strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>developing algorithms</strong> to project the trajectories of biological aging (3,000.-): Wouldn't it be nice to know how you age in comparison to what is normal or ideal for your age and gender? And to know how to decelerate your aging process? We know this is  possible, because we have been working on the data. But we need to translate these data into computer algorithms for the ELF to give you the feedback based on your input.</li>
<li>
<strong>validating the aging algorithms</strong> on real study subjects ($ 5,000.-): It's the grunt work which is necessary to verify the algorithms described above. The real costs for such studies are many multiples of what we are asking here. But we are not calculating our own work, we are simply asking you to help us cover the expenses which go to subject recruitment, consumables and maintenance for testing equipment.</li>
<li>
<strong>Improving the algorithm for predicting weight development</strong> ($ 3,500.-): the ELF not only trains your 6th sense for calorie balance, it also alerts you to your organism's rousing defense against your weight loss attempts. We believe we can predict when this defense system is going to strike you with a ""feeding frenzy"". We need to refine our current algorithm, which is not yet sensitive enough, and we need to test this, again in real subjects.</li>
<li>
<strong>Producing an iphone app</strong> for the 6th sense tool ($ 5,000.-): That's one of the most often voiced criticism of the ELF users among our study subjects: Make it operational on the mobile phone. So, the first app to develop is one for the iPhone. The money goes to the developers of this app.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong><strong>What will you get in return?</strong></strong></h3>
<p>First off, you'll be investing into the bright future of preventive care. In time to come this project could be celebrated as the first and definitive step towards the age of chronic health and longevity. And your name will be attached to it, as one of the privileged few who helped to shape this vision into reality. </p>
<p>That's why we will eternalize every contributor's name on a designated page on our site. <strong>The Chronic Health Wall of Fame</strong>. </p>
<p>We reward contributions of $ 50.- and above with the <strong>12-months ELF package</strong> consisting of a one-year free use of the ELF for one or more persons and an invitation to join as a study participant. Participants' progress will be monitored, and occasional feedback will be given by the study investigator, Dr. Lutz E. Kraushaar.</p>
<p>Here are the perks in summary:</p>
<p><strong>$ 10 - The Inspired:</strong> A personal ""Thank You"" note and mention on the Chronic Health Wall of Fame as the truly Inspired.</p>
<p><strong>$ 50 - The Motivated:</strong> A personal ""Thank You"" note, mention on the Chronic Health Wall of Fame as the Motivated sponsor, plus a 12-months ELF package for 1 person. That person may be you or someone who you want to give the gift of chronic health.</p>
<p><strong>$ 88 - The Enthusiast:</strong> A personal ""Thank You"" note, mention on the Chronic Health Wall of Fame as the Enthusiast that you are, and a 12-months ELF package for 2 persons. Your enthusiasm is contagious and that's a good thing. Because when it comes to changing health behaviors, people always do better in pairs or in groups than alone. Not only because it is fun co compare (or to compete?), but because everyone occasionally needs a friendly urging-on.</p>
<p><strong>$ 188 - The Sponsor:</strong> if you would like to get a small group started on their journey to chronic health here is the deal: a 12-months ELF package for 5 persons, plus, of course, your mention as a Sponsor on the Chronic Health Wall of Fame.</p>
<p><strong>$ 318 - The Patron:</strong> Your ambition to change lives is your gift to your club, group, church or organization. With a 12-months ELF package for 10 persons, and your mention on our Chronic Health Wall of Fame as what you are: the Patron</p>
<p><strong> $ 500 &amp; above - The Evangelist:</strong> Twenty 12-months ELF packages plus one additional package for every 25 Dollars exceeding your $ 500 contribution. If you want this for more than a hundred of your club's members or your organization's employees, talk to us directly, so that we may assist you. In any way, your name and picture will be immortalized on our Chronic Health Wall of Fame as the consummate Health Evangelist.</p>

</div></div>","Side effect: Weight loss
When we enrolled 100 overweight and obese people into a clinical study, ""The chronic health project"", it was NOT ABOUT WEIGHT LOSS.  These guys had focused for years on losing weight and never did (not for long, at least). Now they found themselves dropping their dress size while they actually pursued something else:
An individualized path to chronic health and functional longevity.
So we investigated why. And we made an amazing discovery: the human ability to master a 6th sense for calorie balance. Training it was a side effect of our study intervention.
Now we want to bring that side effect to everybody. With a GPS for chronic health. Globally available like the GPS you use in your car. Only with a different purpose: to create the first epidemic that everyone would like to have - the epidemic of chronic health and waist reduction.
The prototype GPS is ready for our contributors to try out its first feature: training a 6th sense for calorie balance. Your contributions will help us to improve the design and to translate our research results into the add-ons for chronic health and longevity. For everybody.

But first, let me show you why and how we think we can make this fly. And be prepared for a few surprises.

Why would you need a health GPS?


Because your path to health is littered with the traps and temptations of a powerful calorie cartel. It operates with a simple business model: making money by making us fat. And that's the same as making money by making us sick. That's how overweight has become the single largest cause of death and disease. That's why we need a GPS to navigate around those traps. Without having to abstain from whatever makes life so enjoyable.
 

Why do we call it ELF?
ELF stands for Evidence-based Longevity Finder.
As health scientists we know that longevity is a consequence of staying free from chronic disease: heart disease, stroke, diabetes and many cancers. They do not come with growing old. They are the wrong sort of growing old. Which you can avoid with the two most powerful interventions known to biomedical science: the physical activity and the dietary behaviors which exactly match YOUR biological profile.
So, we build this GPS to help you find your personal path to chronic health. A path which is strictly built on biomedical evidence. Which is why we called it the Evidence-based Longevity Finder, the ELF.



Why are we focused on weight?
We are not. As our study participants realized, on the path to chronic health and longevity weight loss is a side effect. But that's a good one, for two reasons: (a) most people desire it and (b) overweight has already become the single largest cause of avoidable disease and death. That's why we made training a 6th sense for calorie balance the ELF's first feature.
 
How does this 6th sense for calorie balance work?
Calorie balance is a 5-dollar word for a five-cent equation: calories-in minus calories-out. The result is what you see on your scale. Only, you see it too late.
With a 6th sense for your daily calorie balance you keep the calorie-in and calorie-out behaviors  intuitively on track to your weight goals. And therefore to your health goals. For good.



Why do we need your financial support?
Because we are about $37,000.- short of developing our tool into a ""Global health Positioning System -- GhPS"".
As health scientists we have spent our own money over the past 4 years to:

set up and run adiphea's health lab
do the basic clinical research on how to make people achieve chronic health
translate our findings into the first testable application

maybe not to your mother-in-law: or are you implying that she is fat?

<p><b>The Need</b></p>
<p>The United States provides the best
healthcare in the world, but only if you can afford it. Everyday Americans die
because they lack access to care. We have the best healthcare technology, but
our healthcare system produces some of the worst health outcomes. In fact, out
of all the countries in the world, our system ranks number 37! </p>
<p>The U.S. healthcare system does rank
number 1 in having the greatest disparities in access in the developed world. The
rich get care; the poor are more likely to get sick and die. This is the only
developed country where you can have health insurance and still go bankrupt due
to non-covered expenses from a medical illness. </p>
<p>You probably know someone who
suffered because of not being able to afford to see the doctor, or was kicked
off his or her health plan, or had a terrible experience with a private
insurance company. We won’t take it anymore! That is why the California Health
Professional Student Alliance (CaHPSA) fights every day to achieve healthcare
justice by advocating for a new and improved Medicare for All.</p>
<p>Medicare is good everywhere, lets you
see any doctor anywhere, is not tied to your job, covers most costs of care,
and since 1965 has guaranteed that our seniors over 65 get the care they need.
We want to improve it, expand it and give it to everyone! Healthcare should be
a social service, not a commodity available only to those who can afford it.</p>
<p><b>What is CaHPSA</b></p>
<p>The California Health Professional
Student Alliance (CaHPSA) is a statewide student-run organization comprised of
thousands of student-activists who fight to make sure no one else dies because he
or she lacks access to health care. We are the California chapter of the
national group, Students for a National Health Program (SNaHP).</p>
<p>Each year we select a stellar team of
student fellows and train them in public speaking, community organizing,
education and advocacy. Our goal is to empower the future leaders of the healthcare
equality movement in California and the country.</p>
<p><b>Why You Should Donate!</b></p>
<p>Your generosity will change the lives
of our young leaders by helping fund their one-year fellowships as statewide
representatives of CaHPSA. Traditionally these students dedicate time to CaHPSA
on top of their hectic classroom schedules in medicine, public health, nursing,
law, biology, social work, kinesiology, occupational therapy and many other
fields. They volunteer to lobby and rally for healthcare equality at the
Capitol and local City Halls, to plan conferences to teach/mobilize their peers
and to host campus debates to showcase that healthcare is a basic human right.
 </p>
<p>Your support means the world to CaHPSA,
a program many students say has opened their eyes and changed their lives. You
are not only building strong leaders, but also helping to improve our community
and the lives of those who desperately need access to quality, affordable health
care.</p>
<p><b>Help Us Fund Our PASSIONATE Student Fellows</b></p>
<p>Help us reach our goal of $10,000 which would allow us to
provide monthly stipends for our student fellows to give them financial support
to plan and carry out their activities as advocates for healthcare reform.</p>
<p><u>NorCal and
Socal Chairpersons (2 Fellows)</u></p>
<p>The two chairpersons are crucial to
CaHPSA. Each facilitates and organizes local CaHPSA chapters in their region, seeks
mentorships with campus faculty, and acts as a liaison between the CaHPSA statewide
program coordinator and the student chapter leaders. The NorCal and Socal Chair
will each receive a monthly stipend of $100 for 12 months from this campaign.</p>
<p><u>Campus
Chapter Leaders (12 Fellows)</u></p>
<p>Campus Chapter Leaders organize,
educate and outreach with students on their college campuses and are
responsible for campus-wide events. These students are the community organizers
and grassroots leaders that spread the message of healthcare equality across
the state of California. Chapter Leaders will receive a monthly stipend of $50
for 12 months.</p>
<p><b>The IMPACT</b></p>
<p>The projects organized by CaHPSA aim
to revolutionize our current healthcare system and improve it dramatically.
While Obamacare has helped a lot of people, some 30 million nationwide will
still be left uninsured. We want you and your loved ones to benefit from a
system in which each and every one of us has the opportunity to get the best
healthcare possible. We can get there by improving and expanding Medicare to
cover everyone.</p>
<p>Your donations to CaHPSA will help
accomplish this by training future healthcare leaders, educating our
communities about health care inequality and building the movement for Medicare
for All.  We will not stand idly by
as people die! With an unyielding fire in our hearts, and a little help
from you, we will make our healthcare system truly number 1, for everyone. </p>

The United States provides the best
healthcare in the world, but only if you can afford it. Everyday Americans die
because they lack access to care. We have the best healthcare technology, but
our healthcare system produces some of the worst health outcomes. In fact, out
of all the countries in the world, our system ranks number 37! 
The U.S. healthcare system does rank
number 1 in having the greatest disparities in access in the developed world. The
rich get care; the poor are more likely to get sick and die. This is the only
developed country where you can have health insurance and still go bankrupt due
to non-covered expenses from a medical illness.

<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Kin water filter"" class=""fit lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/189/350/413d9db379c37dc978803a9b075f816a_large.jpg?1403642737"" src="""" style=""""/><figcaption>Kin water filter</figcaption></figure><p></p>
<p>The $50 “MVP” filter will filter up to 1,000,000 gallons of water and can last several years.  This filter is geared towards villages and communities because of the high flow rate and the extended life of the filter.</p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""MVP water filter"" class=""fit lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/189/351/3742943270a92a7777161ee2d596535d_large.png?1403642764"" src="""" style=""""/><figcaption>MVP water filter</figcaption></figure><p></p>
<p>These filters are the best portable filters on the market and are the most efficient way to provide water quality solutions to poor and remote villages and communities.  </p>
<h2><b>Maintenance:</b></h2>
<p>The simplicity of the filtration system makes these filters long-lasting and dependable.  The process is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the filter starts to slow down or clog, back wash it with clean water using the syringe that is provided in the kit.  </li>
<li>Once the filter is clean, simply reattach it and continue the usage.  This process can be repeated many times, making the filter's lifespan extremely long.</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Filter Functions:</b></h2>
<p>Why filters? Filters can do more than provide drinking water. These filters are efficient in providing safe water for multiple applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleaning </li>
<li>Bathing </li>
<li>Cooking </li>
<li>Watering plants</li>
<li>Other agricultural applications</li>
</ul>
<p>The filters have an extremely high flow rate, <b>eliminating</b> the need to store the water. This reduces the chance of recontamination after the water has been stored for an extended period of time.</p>
<h2><b>What the filters remove:</b></h2>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Hollow fiber membrane that filters out the waterborne diseases"" class=""fit lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/189/362/3f32c2b56be45e50be8bfd72cd41a12c_large.jpeg?1403642956"" src="""" style=""""/><figcaption>Hollow fiber membrane that filters out the waterborne diseases</figcaption></figure><p></p>
<p>The filter removes the bacteria and protozoa which cause waterborne diseases: </p>
<ul>
<li>Cholera </li>
<li>Botulism (Clostridium botulinum) </li>
<li>Typhoid (Salmonella typhil) </li>

<li>Streptococcus </li>
<li>Salmonella </li>
<li>Giardia</li>
<li>Cryptosporidium</li>

<ul><li>The book we create will be comprised of photo documentation of our mission along with a text synopsis of our journey.  It will be made after our trip, and put together in chronological order of the different locations.  The book will be printed and shipped by Feburary, 2015. </li></ul>
<h2><b>Locations:</b></h2>
<ul><li><b>El Salvador </b></li></ul>
<p>El Salvador is in the middle of a water crisis.  55% of people have access to potable water in the country and 80% of that water is heavily contaminated. Many residents have to spend up to 25% of their already low income on water that may already be contaminated.  The clean water filters will give them more spendable income on food and other needs.  The filters will also eliminate the contamination in the water.</p>
<ul><li><b>Nicaragua</b></li></ul>
<p>Nicaragua needs clean water.  It is the poorest country in the region.  The average income is set at $1.00 a day for 40% of the population.  Lack of access to safe water costs Nicaragua an estimated 1,912 million cordobas ($95 million USD) a year.  This figure represents 1.5% of Nicaragua's GDP.    </p>
<ul><li><b>Panama</b></li></ul>
<p>In the target region of northwestern Panama, 80% of the indigenous residents don't have access to clean water.  The water they use is full of bacteria, viruses, and metals that cause all sorts of sickness and diseases.  Kids are the most vulnerable to the problem.  The leading cause of death from bad water in this area is Gastroenteritis.  With the clean water filters, this illness can be eliminated.</p>
<ul><li><b>Ecuador</b></li></ul>
<p>Many foreign organizations have entered and seized Ecuador's natural resources. Indigenous territories have been polluted and contaminated by foreign companies extracting natural resources like timber, crude and palm oil.  The indigenous people have taken a toll as well.  Among other issues, their water has been subjected to contamination.  There is no simple solution to the problems these communities face, but the foundation of their healthy lives starts with access to safe water.  </p>
<h2><b>Location Significance:</b></h2>
<p>The target locations are places that are underdeveloped and at a high risk of natural disasters.  These filters are <b>the most efficient</b> way of providing clean water to these areas.  The alternative, bottled water, has several problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shipping bottled water has huge fixed costs </li>
<li>The plastic is not environmentally friendly</li>
<li>Bottled water is a non-replenishable water source  </li>
</ul>
<p>One community filter can give 100 people access to clean water each day, and if maintained properly, can last for years.  </p>
<h2><b>Process:</b></h2>
<p>The process to set up the filtration systems is as simple as it gets.  There is no need to dig a well to try and find a water source, no construction of sand filters (what many communities use now to try and get rid of the contamination in the water) and most importantly, no need for purification chemicals which can be worse than the original bacteria.  The kits will contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>The 0.1 micron absolute filter</li>
<li>The bucket adapter kit</li>
<li>The bucket hole cutter</li>
<li>The filter cleaner</li>
<li>The filter hanger</li>
<li>The adapter hose to each community.  </li>
</ul>
<p>The one thing we will need to find is a clean bucket or plastic container.  The communities already have these buckets because they use them to gather water from rivers, streams, rain water etc.  They do <b>NOT</b> have the filtration devices to make this collected water safe for drinking, bathing, cooking etc. That is what we will provide.  </p>
<h2><b>Goal:</b></h2>
<p>The main goal is to help as many people as possible.  We will contact the communities through a representative from a local non-profit or another organization doing humanitarian work in the location and set up a presentation meeting to the people who will use the filters and answer any questions they may have.</p>
<p>There are so many areas in the world that don't have access to clean water and this needs to change. </p>
<ul>
<li>Clean, safe usable water is a necessity for so many things we do each day.  This mission is a resource-efficient, environmentally friendly, non-profit solution to a fundamental global problem.  </li>
<li>It is with your contributions that we can make a vital change for many communities and raise awareness about providing clean water solutions to impoverished countries around the world. </li>
</ul>
<div><br/></div>
</div><h3><b>Potential Risks and Challenges:</b></h3><p>Other than our personal safety during the trip, the risk is low. We are aiding people in need of a fundamental resource.

Kin water filter
The $50 “MVP” filter will filter up to 1,000,000 gallons of water and can last several years.  This filter is geared towards villages and communities because of the high flow rate and the extended life of the filter.

MVP water filter
These filters are the best portable filters on the market and are the most efficient way to provide water quality solutions to poor and remote villages and communities.  
Maintenance:
The simplicity of the filtration system makes these filters long-lasting and dependable.  The process is simple:

When the filter starts to slow down or clog, back wash it with clean water using the syringe that is provided in the kit.  
Once the filter is clean, simply reattach it and continue the usage.  This process can be repeated many times, making the filter's lifespan extremely long.

Filter Functions:
Why filters? Filters can do more than provide drinking water. These filters are efficient in providing safe water for multiple applications:

Cleaning 
Bathing 
Cooking 
Watering plants
Other agricultural applications

The filters have an extremely high flow rate, eliminating the need to store the water. This reduces the chance of recontamination after the water has been stored for an extended period of time.
What the filters remove:

Hollow fiber membrane that filters out the waterborne diseases
The filter removes the bacteria and protozoa which cause waterborne diseases: 

Cholera 
Botulism (Clostridium botulinum) 
Typhoid (Salmonella typhil) 
Amoebic Dysentery 
E. coli 
Coliform Bacteria 
Streptococcus 
Salmonella 
Giardia
Cryptosporidium
Cyclospora 
The filters clean the water at a 0.1 micron absolute level, making it impossible for any bacteria, protozoa to pass through the filter.


The Clean Cup Water Mission Photo Book: 
The book we create will be comprised of photo documentation of our mission along with a text synopsis of our journey.  It will be made after our trip, and put together in chronological order of the different locations.  The book will be printed and shipped by Feburary, 2015. 
Locations:
El Salvador 
El Salvador is in the middle of a water crisis.  55% of people have access to potable water in the country and 80% of that water is heavily contaminated. Many residents have to spend up to 25% of their already low income on water that may already be contaminated.  The clean water filters will give them more spendable income on food and other needs.  The filters will also eliminate the contamination in the water.
Nicaragua
Nicaragua needs clean water.  It is the poorest country in the region.  The average income is set at $1.00 a day for 40% of the population.  Lack of access to safe water costs Nicaragua an estimated 1,912 million cordobas ($95 million USD) a year.  This figure represents 1.5% of Nicaragua's GDP.    
Panama
In the target region of northwestern Panama, 80% of the indigenous residents don't have access to clean water.  The water they use is full of bacteria, viruses, and metals that cause all sorts of sickness and diseases.  Kids are the most vulnerable to the problem.  The leading cause of death from bad water in this area is Gastroenteritis.  With the clean water filters, this illness can be eliminated.
Ecuador
Many foreign organizations have entered and seized Ecuador's natural resources. Indigenous territories have been polluted and contaminated by foreign companies extracting natural resources like timber, crude and palm oil.  The indigenous people have taken a toll as well.  Among other issues, their water has been subjected to contamination.  There is no simple solution to the problems these communities face, but the foundation of their healthy lives starts with access to safe water.  
Location Significance:
The target locations are places that are underdeveloped and at a high risk of natural disasters.  These filters are the most efficient way of providing clean water to these areas.  The alternative, bottled water, has several problems:

Shipping bottled water has huge fixed costs 
The plastic is not environmentally friendly
Bottled water is a non-replenishable water source  

One community filter can give 100 people access to clean water each day, and if maintained properly, can last for years.  
Process:
The process to set up the filtration systems is as simple as it gets.  There is no need to dig a well to try and find a water source, no construction of sand filters (what many communities use now to try and get rid of the contamination in the water) and most importantly, no need for purification chemicals which can be worse than the original bacteria.  The kits will contain:

The 0.1 micron absolute filter
The bucket adapter kit
The bucket hole cutter
The filter cleaner
The filter hanger
The adapter hose to each community.  

The one thing we will need to find is a clean bucket or plastic container.  The communities already have these buckets because they use them to gather water from rivers, streams, rain water etc.  They do NOT have the filtration devices to make this collected water safe for drinking, bathing, cooking etc. That is what we will provide.  
Goal:
The main goal is to help as many people as possible.  We will contact the communities through a representative from a local non-profit or another organization doing humanitarian work in the location and set up a presentation meeting to the people who will use the filters and answer any questions they may have.
There are so many areas in the world that don't have access to clean water and this needs to change. 

Clean, safe usable water is a necessity for so many things we do each day.  This mission is a resource-efficient, environmentally friendly, non-profit solution to a fundamental global problem.  
It is with your contributions that we can make a vital change for many communities and raise awareness about providing clean water solutions to impoverished countries around the world. 


Potential Risks and Challenges:Other than our personal safety during the trip, the risk is low. We are aiding people in need of a fundamental resource. Providing these communities with clean water will bring them joy and a higher quality of basic life.The sky is the limit for this project.

<p>I started ‘Basic
Shit’ as a college project to create awareness about sanitation. Research made me realize that, along with awareness, innovative solutions were
required to be setup within the realms of governing bodies. I particularly
wanted to address the issue of public urination, which affected me and others
around me greatly in our daily lives. I started interviewing people who
frequently urinate on the street to understand their mindset. The most common
answers were the lack of urinals around. Whether that was an excuse for the shameful act
or the actual reason, I realized that if urinals were installed in common
urinating spots on the streets, people would use them. I needed a low cost,
easy and portable solution, so I built it. I request you to help us ingrain the
importance of hygiene among society and generously contribute to bring a change.</p>

</div></div>","Our goal is to build hygienic, low cost, portable urinals that can be set
up by unskilled labor in public areas where people frequently urinate in the open. A
prototype unit of such urinals has already been made and installed at a common urinating spot (AIIMS) and has gotten tremendous response from the locals of the area who used to suffer due to the bad odor, mosquitoes/flies, and
contamination. The urinals are connected to the sewers through manholes
to ensure correct disposal of the waste. The urinals are made from 20 Litre
water jars (biodegradable recycled plastic) with tin sheds to cover the unit. These
urinals are economical (under $50 per urinal and $400 for a unit i.e. a set of
5 urinals) and can be installed, maintained and replaced very easily. This is an easy solution to the  menace of
public urination on the streets. These urinals are accompanied by infographics (painted though stencil sketches) to help people learn about hygiene and common practices to keep their
surroundings clean. 
The project invokes a sense responsibility in people
who take such issues for granted. Introduce no water urinals technology in these urinals to improve the standards of the urinals.



Public Urination Is A Disease! 
People urinate in the open without any shame as a common habit, without any
regard for women/men passing by, the terrible smell, and the potential diseases. We feel deeply affected by such apathy. Following The Gandhian Principle “Be the change that you wish to see in
the world”, we wanted to bring a change in the society by solving this problem. We have spent innumerable hours and personal funds in the
pilot project and have seen a 100% change in urination habits. We would now like
to install these low cost and easy to install and maintain public urinals all
over the city to curb this menace and create a city-wide--then later a country-wide--change.



Founder: Ashwani Aggarwal – Street Artist, Product Designer and
Social Innovator
I started ‘Basic
Shit’ as a college project to create awareness about sanitation. Research made me realize that, along with awareness, innovative solutions were
required to be setup within the realms of governing bodies. I particularly
wanted to address the issue of public urination, which affected me and others
around me greatly in our daily lives. I started interviewing people who
frequently urinate on the street to understand their mindset. The most common

or the actual reason, I realized that if urinals were installed in common
urinating spots on the streets, people would use them. I needed a low cost,
easy and portable solution, so I built it. I request you to help us ingrain the
importance of hygiene among society and generously contribute to bring a change.


We have
currently identified over 30 walls in Delhi on which more than 500 people urinate on in a day. We would like to
build a Basic Shit unit in front of each of these. We have received permission from the local authorities for over 20 such walls. Your contribution will help
us build and maintain these units. 









We need
$12,000 (Rs. 7,20,000) for our Phase 1: building Basic Shit Units in
20 locations in Delhi and their maintenance for a year. Each unit costs us $400 (Rs.
24,000) to install. We want to install over 20- 30 units and spend the rest on weekly maintenance. 

    



Ashwani, a street artist and product designer, has designed some unique and quirky products related to sanitation as
give-aways to our contributors. We have crazy stickers, paper-soaps, chocolate-bar
style soaps that can be carried conveniently, etc. We are trying to make a goodie
bag of these fun products for all types of contributions. If you can give us enough to
build a unit or two, we will name that unit after you and send you our goodie bag. Any contribution will help.












If we don’t
reach a 100% of our goal, we will make as many units as we can with the received
funds. Every additional $400 will help us to provide a unit at a place and clean up the city.


Basic Shit urinals are solving one of the biggest problems in India: sanitation. Millions of people die each year in India due to diseases caused by unhygienic practices and a lack of sanitation.  We are trying to make a dent in this number by creating a preventive measure. We categorise the impact into the following three categories:
Economic Impact:

a) Use of the infrastructure is absolutely free to the public. This is the first initiative of its kind that has no usage fee involved. FREE FOR ALL.
b) The parts used in developing the prototype

c) The prototype can be easily replicated on a
mass basis with unskilled labor. OF

Social Impact:

a) This project provides the public a chance

b) Community health and hygiene, as well as

1) Maintenance of these urinals is a challenge as water
resources are not commonly available near the locations. Once these
urinals are installed at various locations, a team of workers will be required
to maintain these urinals.
2) The risk of these urinals being destroyed is high; thus, they require regular inspection. We
are keeping a buffer fund for this. The cost for replacing individual urinals
is as low $20.
3) The requisite permission required for
installing these low cost urinals from the local authority takes time and
effort. We have already received permission for 20 locations in Delhi. We are
being supported by the authorities for the same.

Columbia Heart Beat publisher/editor ""Mike Martin and I have a philosophical gulf as wide as the Grand Canyon."" 
So said Columbia Mayor Robert McDavid on KFRU radio recently, and it's a good thing.     A good thing for a journalist to keep a healthy distance from the corridors of power -- power Dr. McDavid's administration has worked overtime to increase with one bad plan after another.  Plans like Blight, Ward Gerrymandering, TIF, rate hikes, fee hikes, and in November, a whopping property tax hike that have taken a toll on the wills and wallets of Columbia's hardworking citizens.

<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Проект</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Около 20 лет семьям из села Каротан приходится пить  воду из грязного колодца. Мужчины, женщины и дети проделывают путь в 3 километра несколько раз в день, чтобы набрать воды из единственного колодца  в округе, расплачиваясь за нее своим здоровьем. Только в 2010 году было выявлено 34 случая серьезной кишечной инфекции в деревне и ее окрестностях. Направив чистую воду из ближайшего источника в простой бетонированный бассейн можно значительно уменьшить риск заболеваний. В соседнем селе Гетап,  к 2012 году 3 каменных бассейна позволили местным жителям пользоваться чистой водой – в общей сложности 8 тонн воды к 2012 году. Организация Туфенкян хотела бы применить этот успешный метод  в селе Каротан, передавая по трубам, протяженностью 7,5 км воду из природного источника в новый 50 тонный бассейн. Заполненный резервуар мог бы снабжать водой 465 жителей Каротан и соседних Вардабатс, Кумайри и Пакахан.</span></p>

Նախագիծը
Շուրջ 20 տարի Կարոտանի ընտանիքները ջուր են խմել կեղտոտ ջրհորներից: Տղամարդիկ, կանայք ու երեխաներն օրվա ընթացքում մի քանի անգամ քայլում են ավելի քան 3 կիլոմետր, որպեսզի ջուր վերցնեն տարածքի միակ ջրհորից, վտանգելով իրենց առողջությունը: Միայն 2010-ին գյուղում եւ շրջակայքում հաղորդում է ստացվել վտանգավոր աղիքային վարակի 34 դեպքի վերաբերյալ: Եթե մոտակա բնական աղբյուրից մաքուր ջուր բերվի դեպի հասարակ բետոնե ավազան, ապա ջրածին հիվանդությունների վտանգը նկատելիորեն կնվազի: Հարակից Գետափի երեք քարե ավազանները միասին 8 տոննա ջուր են տրամադրում տեղի բնակիչներին 2012-ից սկսած: Թուֆենկյան հիմնադրամը ցանկանում է առաջ տանել այս հաջողությունը դեպի Կարոտան՝ ջրի խողովակներ անցկացնելով 7.5 կմ. հեռու գտնվող բնական աղբյուրից դեպի նոր 50 տոննա ծավալով ավազան: Կառուցումից հետո այն մաքուր ջրով կապահովի Կարոտանի 465 բնակիչներին եւ հարեւան Վարդաբաց, Կումայրի եւ Փակահան գյուղերին:
Աշխատանքի ստեղծում
Առաջարկվող շինարարությունը ութշաբաթյա աշխատանք կտրամադրի շուրջ 15 մարդու Կարոտան եւ հարակից Իշխանաձոր գյուղերից:
Կայուն զարգացում
Օգտագործվող բոլոր շինարարական նյութերը ձեռք կբերվեն Լեռնային Ղարաբաղում: Քաշաթաղի տարածքային ջրային տնտեսության պարբերական խնամքի դեպքում նոր ջրահամակարգը կգործի ամենաքիչը հաջորդ 50 տարվա ընթացքում: Խնամքը ներառում է ողջ ջրահամակարգի հիմնային մաքրում տարին երկու անգամ:

Ղարաբաղյան պատերազմի ընթացքում կռիվ մղեց հայերի հետ տարածքը վերահսկողության տակ առնելու համար:

Эта кампания собирает средства от имени фонда Туфенкян Inc.- проверенной некоммерческой организации. Кампания не обязательно отражает точку зрения организации или имеет какие-то формальные отношения с ним. Все взносы считаются неограниченными подарками и не могут быть указаны для какой-либо другой отдельной цели.
Жители Каротан устали от того, что вынуждены пить темную загрязненную воду. Да, они сыты по горло. Но они также постоянно ослабевают от пищеварительных болезней. Время перемен СЕЙЧАС.
Мы начали кампанию по обеспечению чистой воды Каротан (и три окрестные деревни) в январе 2013 года и достигли 65% от нашей $ 22913 цели  финансирования. Теперь, после получения $ 3000 пожертвовании в промежутке, мы полны решимости, чтобы закончить то, что начали - и мы не можем сделать это без вас.
Проект
Около 20 лет семьям из села Каротан приходится пить  воду из грязного колодца. Мужчины, женщины и дети проделывают путь в 3 километра несколько раз в день, чтобы набрать воды из единственного колодца  в округе, расплачиваясь за нее своим здоровьем. Только в 2010 году было выявлено 34 случая серьезной кишечной инфекции в деревне и ее окрестностях. Направив чистую воду из ближайшего источника в простой бетонированный бассейн можно значительно уменьшить риск заболеваний. В соседнем селе Гетап,  к 2012 году 3 каменных бассейна позволили местным жителям пользоваться чистой водой – в общей сложности 8 тонн воды к 2012 году. Организация Туфенкян хотела бы применить этот успешный метод  в селе Каротан, передавая по трубам, протяженностью 7,5 км воду из природного источника в новый 50 тонный бассейн. Заполненный резервуар мог бы снабжать водой 465 жителей Каротан и соседних Вардабатс, Кумайри и Пакахан.
Создание рабочих мест
Для предложенной конструкции потребуется около 15 рабочих из Каротан и соседнего Ишханадзор на 8 недель строительного периода.
Устойчивое развитие
Все используемые строительные материалы  будут приобретены в  Нагорном Карабахе.  При регулярном уходе  регионального водного отдела Кашатах, новая система будет функционировать как минимум ближайшие 50 лет.  Уход включает в себя глубокую очистку водопроводной магистрали два раза в год.
О Каротан
Каротан и соседние селы Вардабатс, Кумайри и Пакахан являются самыми густо-населенными и плодородными территориями Кашатаха, провинции Нагорного Карабаха.
История Нагорного Карабаха
Нагорный Карабах является суверенным  государством, расположенным в восточной части Республики Армения. Он населен и управляется армянами, которые веками живут в этом регионе. Его независимость оспаривается соседним Азербайджаном, который боролся с армянами за власть на этой территории в Нагорно-Карабахской войне 1988-1994 гг.
Временной график проекта
Бассейн будет полностью готов к использованию к середине 2013 года.

<p>         My name is Max Lyons and I am 14 years old and come to Brazil every summer. This summer I was fortunate to meet Lucas who is only a few years older than me.

<p>         Lucas is 20 years old and lives in Ubaitaba, Brazil. When Lucas was 18 years old he was in a motorcycle crash that changed his life. On the rainy day of February 16, 2010 Lucas was coming home from the bank on his motorcycle. As he waited to enter a traffic circle, a Suburban entered behind him. The driver wasn't paying attention and plowed Lucas down. Lucas was thrown off his motorcycle forcefully and he flew two meters, landing in a pool of water. He was then rushed to a hospital located 40 minutes away. Lucas arrived in a coma and soon after had a heart attack. He was then put on a feeding tube and had his right leg amputated. He had to spend one month in the hospital on a feeding tube with help all day and night. Before the accident, Lucas used to surf in competitions, skateboard and do a Brazilian martial arts called capoeira. He needs donations for a surgery to help correct his left leg so that he can balance on it and to then get a prosthesis for his right leg. Lucas's dream is to walk. Any amount of money you would be able to donate would be appreciated.</p>

Let it clean your teeth in 10 seconds and restore your shiny smile as soon as possible.   Why does Brush Lee achieve the function of auto-foaming? After almost one year trials and testing, finally Brush Lee comes out. Multiple functions with one button click, it’s really convenient while brushing, especially for kids and the elder.  How does it vibrate? Here is how the magic happens. After testing many types of motors, magnetic suspension sonic motor is our final choice. Such motors produce high frequency acoustic vibrations that create cavitation effects in the periodontal instance.  The sound energy transmitted by each bristles produces a cavitation effect, which effectively cleans the teeth. Wireless Charging  The body is equipped with the latest charging technology. The built-in wireless charging (Qi) module adopts ABS flame retardant material.   Waterproof  IPX7 waterproof, you can wash the whole body of the machine. No need to worry about any damage of the brush. Mouthpiece Most of toothbrush bristles currently sols on the market, both traditional and E- toothbrushes are nylon bristles. It cleans the teeth by a large amount of physical mechanical friction, but at the same time, it is easy to damage the enamel and cause bleeding gums.  However, we choose the medical grade liquid silicone for the bristle, which has excellent physiological inertia and chemical inertness. It is widely used in baby pacifiers and medical supplies. It is soft and comfortable without damaging the gums and enamel. It does not cause any foreign sensation in the mouth, so it’s the ideal toothbrush material.  As for the bristle design, we refer to The Bass Method of Brushing recommended by the American Dental Association. Accordingly, the bristle and the teeth are aligned at an angle of 45°, and with testing and trials, the combination of the shape, length, thickness and arrangement of various bristle is perfect to achieve the best effect.Now, there are 1244 bristles on one Brush Lee mouthpiece. On average, each tooth is cleaned by nearly 38 bristles with comprehensive vibration cleaning. Where is toothpaste? It is hard to imagine that Brush Lee as a fully automatic toothbrush would ask a user to squeeze toothpaste.  With Brush Lee, you don’t even need to squeeze your own toothpaste because it is already done for you at the touch of a button. Brush Lee uses specialized toothpaste liquid. Compared with regular paste toothpaste, the toothpaste liquid can achieve rapid and even bubbling that can collaborate perfectly with our brush. Bluetooth APP  Want to brush your teeth longer? Perhaps a more intense brush?  You can change the time and intensity of brushing by changing the personal preference settings in the Brush Lee App. Such datas, like the number of days the brush used and the amount of power of the toothbrush are shown on the app
Four choices of the foaming time: 2 seconds, 3 seconds, 4 seconds, and 5 seconds;
Five types of brushing time: 10 seconds, 15 seconds, 20 seconds, 30 seconds, and 60 seconds;
Four modes for selection: Neophyte mode, Sensitive mode, Cleaning mode, and Polishing mode.
 Compared with the traditional toothbrush, what makes Brush Lee different?  Brushing your teeth is a daily routine, but not every one takes it seriously. The average brushing time is 60 seconds, not 180 seconds which is often recommended by dentists. You would spend 131 days on brushing teeth through your whole life, and ninety percent of tooth and gum disease is caused by improper brushing. Brush Lee makes brushing less annoying. Some of us are so sick of brushing our teeth that we don't brush long enough, or our method is ineffective or inefficient, or even not brushing our teeth at all. For those who brush their teeth carefully for 180 seconds in both morning and evening, Brush Lee has the advantage of saving time and making brushing more enjoyable.  10 seconds is unbelievable? You should brush your teeth every time up to a total of 180 seconds. It only takes 10 seconds to use Brush Lee. There’re about 32 teeth on the mouth, which adds up to 96 teeth surfaces overall. On average, traditional toothbrushes only brush per tooth surface for 1.875 seconds . But Brush Lee cleans teeth surfaces from all-round, and achieves the efficient brushing in 10 seconds by the high frequency vibration. This is far more than the actual time your teeth were brushed for, and achieves a fast and effective brushing effect. We conducted product trial and research after the small-scale manufacturing, and based on that result we have tested and optimized almost all components of the product, such as the mouthpiece, motors, batteries and pumps.This 10-Seconds Fully Auto-Toothbrush is a brand-new device that needs more supporting. The product links together those of us who are interested in health and passionate about technology. And more importantly, we want to be recognized by everyone.  Timeline  Now we need your help to enter the final stage, complete the final mass production. RewardsA good product needs your help to be effective. The prototype and pre-production unit is funded by us. However, here comes a great opportunity. At present, we are facing high upfront costs related to the mold, certification, research, minimum amount of purchase, as well as the development of bluetooth modules and apps. We need your support!  Join Brush Lee’s Family We believe that kickstarter is a platform where offer opportunity for many like-minded entrepreneurs and developers to get support. We hope that people like us will recognize and support Brush Lee!",22.0,2,"1 Campaign

<h3>Melissa Story</h3>
<p>My name is Jensen and I am putting together a medical fund on behalf of my step-mother Melissa. I have set up a medical fund to help my family with the medical bills. I am calling all friends, family, and those who may not know her to donate to her cause if you can. Thanks. </p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Turn For The Worst</h3>
<p> She is a young vibrant mother of two boys and is without medical insurance or employment. She has always been a healthy woman and once had a very promising college basketball career and is a very active person and out of no where she was taken down with several bouts of Crohn's disease symptoms over this past year and half, she had been working hard to keep herself healthy by eating well and exercising but it didnt seem to be enough as the disease progressed over this past six months and today has put her in the hospital for a 4 weeks undergoing 19 blood transfusions, and a surgery to remove 80% of her colon. About a week after the surgery she was then readministered to the hospital due to unforseen complications, and had to undergo another surgery. The ability to pay for these medical bills is overwhelming and an unreachable goal to her and her family. Both her and her husband, unemployed currently have a great financial burden upon them. I care about this family so very much and want to reach out to the loving, compassionate, and emphathetic people of this world to consider this family by assisting in helping this family meet their growing financial medical needs. Thank you so much!! p&gt;</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>All of the money received will go toward these costly medical bills. Even if we do not hit our goal anything will help and will go toward paying this debt. Our goal is $60,000 that will hopefully make a small dent in the large hospital bills to come. </p>

<p>Hi! My name is Isabel and I am <em>not</em> a runner.  Ha!  Seriously though, I hate running.  Buuuuut, I signed up for a 1/2 marathon in November.   I decided this run should be about something bigger than me.  Like a mission.  I can do a mission.</p>
<p>Meet my friend Luke!  Luke is 15 years old. He loves golf, tanks, helicopters, history, reading, hot dogs, spaghetti, &amp; good hamburgers.  He’s an old soul with a love for 80’s, classical music, &amp; Legos.  He plays the trombone &amp; violin. He’s a freshman in high school and dreams about being an engineer, traveling the world, and inventing something really important for humanity. Basically, awesome.</p>
<p>Luke has cancer.  On May 24, 2011 he was diagnosed with leukemia.  Luke also has Asperger’s Syndrome.  But Luke is a fighter!  He’s a testament to the human spirit and just a really cool kid!</p>
<p><strong>***For every $10 raised I am going to sew alternating gold and puzzled colored ribbons to my race jersey to raise awareness for childhood cancer and Autism.***  </strong></p>
<p>Your donation will not only help me look super fly on race day…but it’ll contribute to desperately needed funding for research for treatments and a cure!  Your donation will also help provide some financial support for the families of children with cancer.</p>
<h3><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>My goal is to raise $500.  Totally doable. :)</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>$50:</strong> A piece of running history. That's right, a piece of the race jersey from my FIRST (and possibly only) 1/2 marathon. Don't worry, it'll be washed first, I guess. ;)</p>

</ul><h3><strong>Your Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Your support means the world to me because of what it can do to help people like my friend Luke!!</p>
<p>Cancer affects so many of us and our loved ones. With more research, we get closer to finding a cure.  </p>
<p>Autism can be crippling to a person without therapy and intervention. With the right kind of help, people with Autism can do amazing things. Luke has already accomplished so much in his life.  Funding for Autism will help many others be able to do the same.</p>
