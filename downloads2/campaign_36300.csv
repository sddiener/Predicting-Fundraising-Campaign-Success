<h3>Premium Emergency Home Water Storage</h3>
<p>The Barrel is pressurized which is essential to accomplish water circulation and to keep an airtight system. It turns out, there's nothing else like it for storing water – which is why we were able to patent the technology.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The water inside circulates with each use</strong></li>
<li>Built with <strong>ultra high-quality components</strong> that are safe for drinking</li>
<li>All parts are <strong>lead-free* </strong>California compliant</li>
<li>Made with <strong>food-grade and recyclable plastic ♴ with UV inhibitors</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">And it's incredibly <strong>easy to setup.</strong></p>

<h3>It Is Nothing like a Rain Barrel or a 55-Gallon Container</h3>
<p>Our Barrel is engineered to take the guesswork out of how to keep your drinking water safe. The pressurized design allows you to connect the back of the Barrel directly to your drinkable water source. You'll also connect a hose to the front of the Barrel. <strong>Every time you use your hose,</strong> water is pulled through the Barrel, <strong>automatically replenishing the water inside with new water.</strong> The Waterfull Barrel is easy to install, easy to store, and easy to access – and easy for you to take care of yourself and your family. </p>

<h3>A New Way to Store Water</h3>
<p>People are unprepared for emergencies because they lead busy lives, they prioritize food instead of water, they miscalculate how much water they actually need, they forget to check and rotate their food and water every 6 months, or they simply don’t know where to start.</p>

<h3>Hurricane Wind Tested</h3>
<p>We pride ourselves on the durability of our barrel, so much that we subjected it to hurricane force winds.  We successfully tested and the Barrel <strong>sustained winds of 140 mph! </strong>That is enough stability to surpass a <strong>Category 3 hurricane.</strong> Rest assured, the Waterfull Barrel will be <strong>there for you</strong> when you need it most.</p>

<h3>Rotationally Molded with Premium Plastic to Withstand Water Pressure and the Elements</h3>
<p>To integrate our pressurized design of the Barrel and the need for food-safe parts, we use only <strong>rotational molding</strong> as our manufacturing process.

<h3>Why Is It so Difficult to Store Water?</h3>
<p>In 2004, families stood in long lines just to receive drinking water before Hurricane Charley hit. If they were unprepared before the hurricane landed, we could only imagine how they fared afterwards.<strong> The inaccessibility to drinkable water disturbed us–it seemed like a fixable problem, one that shouldn’t even exist in the first place. </strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556641469/qqpgosxq08jgzksxkq5q.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We began to ask why it hadn’t been solved yet. We looked at rain barrels which store undrinkable water and water barrels on the market that were too big and difficult to use. We wanted something simple to use that wouldn't be an eyesore. It wasn't out there and this didn’t sit well with us. <strong>Why couldn’t residents, cities and states be better prepared with drinkable water that's easy to store? </strong></p>
<p>We decided to tackle water accessibility and preparedness ourselves–because we knew it was a problem within our power and skill set to fix. And fix it we did! The Waterfull Barrel exists because we believe everyone should have access to drinkable water. And that taking care of your loved ones <strong>isn’t just an individual responsibility, but a communal one.</strong></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>First:</strong> We’ve tested our Barrel, received feedback, and made adjustments in our design to ensure that not only a quality product is produced, but one that families everywhere can rely on. Your backing will help allow us to purchase two upgraded molds. The new molds will help us improve the Barrel in three key areas: the new design is more durable, reduces assembly time, and increases production capacity. Which means that we can make heavier-duty Barrels, make more of them, and in a shorter amount of time. </p>
<p><strong>Second:</strong> Hurricane season is coming. Since we started this project, there’s been an increase in natural disasters, especially in hurricane-prone areas. By backing us, you’re helping us reach in-need communities that much quicker, and when it comes to emergencies, timing is everything. We’ve seen the damage hurricanes can cause, especially when exacerbated by climate change, so we’re serious about getting these Barrels out.</p>
<h3>How We Will Use Your Support</h3>
<p>We’ve designed our product, gone through several prototypes and beta tests, and received our patent! This means we’re ready for the next step: Manufacturing. </p>
<p>It is important to us that we keep the manufacturing of the Barrel as local as possible. That will allow us to manage quality control and ensure all parts are safe for drinking, which we can’t oversee overseas. Our manufacturing partner is not only in the United States but since they helped us produce our first prototypes, they’re intimately familiar with our product. This expert level of manufacturing results in a premium product but high inventory costs.</p>
<p>Due to the pressurized design of the Barrel and the need for food-safe parts, we could only use rotational molding as our manufacturing process which results in a higher cost.</p>
<p>While we've been able to cover these costs up until now in our product development stage, we need the funds to get the ball rolling on sales of our product.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><strong>The Manufacturing Process: </strong><br/>Once we purchase the new molds with your support, we will need to run some quality control tests. This can cause delays in the manufacturing process if there are kinks in our molds. If orders exceed our expectations, this can also cause delays in our manufacturing process. We will do our best to ship to our earliest backers first. We estimate this process will take about 3 months.</p>
<p><strong>Other Challenges: </strong><br/>Weather can also affect delivery of our product (hurricane season in particular is approaching). Additionally, should there be an impending natural disaster, we may need to send Barrels to crisis areas–which would delay either the manufacturing of your Barrel, shipping of your Barrel, or both.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Shipping &amp; Fulfillment</h3>
<p>Whether you order one or two Barrels, there will only be one UPS ground charge of $65. By shipping UPS ground, we avoid shipping freight which requires a signature upon delivery. Unfortunately, we cannot provides these rates to Alaska, Hawaii, or U.S. territories. If you live somewhere other than the lower 48 states, please contact us to see if we can arrange shipping.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Please Help Get the Word Out</h3>
<p>We believe our Barrel can help save lives. So if you can't purchase one now, please share our Indiegogo campaign with your friends and family. Use the Indiegogo share tools!</p>

The Barrel is pressurized which is essential to accomplish water circulation and to keep an airtight system. It turns out, there's nothing else like it for storing water – which is why we were able to patent the technology.

The water inside circulates with each use
Built with ultra high-quality components that are safe for drinking
All parts are lead-free* California compliant
Made with food-grade and recyclable plastic ♴ with UV inhibitors


And it's incredibly easy to setup.

It Is Nothing like a Rain Barrel or a 55-Gallon Container
Our Barrel is engineered to take the guesswork out of how to keep your drinking water safe. The pressurized design allows you to connect the back of the Barrel directly to your drinkable water source. You'll also connect a hose to the front of the Barrel. Every time you use your hose, water is pulled through the Barrel, automatically replenishing the water inside with new water. The Waterfull Barrel is easy to install, easy to store, and easy to access – and easy for you to take care of yourself and your family. 

A New Way to Store Water
People are unprepared for emergencies because they lead busy lives, they prioritize food instead of water, they miscalculate how much water they actually need, they forget to check and rotate their food and water every 6 months, or they simply don’t know where to start.


Hurricane Wind Tested
We pride ourselves on the durability of our barrel, so much that we subjected it to hurricane force winds.  We successfully tested and the Barrel sustained winds of 140 mph! That is enough stability to surpass a Category 3 hurricane. Rest assured, the Waterfull Barrel will be there for you when you need it most.

Rotationally Molded with Premium Plastic to Withstand Water Pressure and the Elements
To integrate our pressurized design of the Barrel and the need for food-safe parts, we use only rotational molding as our manufacturing process. Rotational molding gives Waterfull an ultra-thick construction and Category 3 hurricane stability.

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> </p>
<p>As demand for energy increases word wide our planet faces the repercussions of our energy consumption in the form of global warming and the depletion of natural resources. Oil, coal and natural gas that were once considered as abundant and unlimited resources are now recognized as exhaustible and in limited supply for humankind's long-term needs. </p>
<p>Creating Dams for Hydroelectric energy destroys untold acres of land, habitat for wildlife and submerges mineral and other resources. Nuclear Energy plants still have the problem of how to safely store radioactive material for hundreds of thousands of years, and keeping radioactive plutonium from becoming material for nuclear weapons. </p>
<p>All of these large scale energy methods are not available to billions of people worldwide in developing countries, and the resources necessary to produce energy from these methods will require capitol expenditures amounting to trillions of dollars. In addition, an infrastructure (for transmission) would need to be built, and consumers will still be reliant on a distribution system for their energy needs that requires them to purchase energy into perpetuity without ever expecting to have a sense of ownership. </p>
<p>Alternative energy production (solar, wind, wave, hydrogen, geothermal and others) will be contributing significantly to the ever increasing worldwide demand for cheap, clean, reliable and sustainable forms of energy.  </p>
<p>The reality that humans must utilize sources of energy that are abundant, clean and relatively safe is inescapable. We must look at our present failures based on relying on fossil fuels, and not make the mistake of becoming dependent on even more dangerous sources of energy like nuclear fusion as our ""quick fix"". We are at a juncture where our choices will impact the planet and the future of billions of people around the globe. </p>
<p>Though the moment is critical, it is also ripe for implementing true quantitative change in-regards to ecologically healthy design and development. The time is overdue in developing counties for oppressive outmoded systems of development to be replaced with forward thinking, organic, sustainable technologies that appreciably improve the quality of life without jeopardizing our planets health. </p>
<p><strong>The challenge/problem:</strong> </p>
<p>The reliance on fossil fuels to feed our energy demands in developed countries will someday come to an end as oil supplies diminish, and prices are driven up. Developing countries have never had the luxury of cheap fuel to drive industry and development, as a consequence the standard of living and the quality of life for billions of people is dismally marginal. What has worked for developed industrial societies is not the template for developing societies.</p>
<p>It is time for developing societies to evaluate the outcomes of the course of actions taken by western societies, learning from their mistakes and choosing healthier alternatives. A better choice would be to find appropriate solutions that will lead to a synergistic, sustainable and more a productive future. </p>
<p>Fossil fuels, coal and hydroelectric energy, the main stay of western power production will not serve developing countries for a variety of reasons. Unfortunately many alternative techniques to produce energy have limitations that prevent them from meeting the needs of many people. Wave technology requires proximity to a coastline and transmission lines with substations to deliver power. Geothermal technology requires proximity to tectonic faults/vents and also requires a network to deliver power to users. </p>
<p>So far the most available solar technology is solar panels using photovoltaic technologies. Even though the price of photovoltaic technology has decreased since their appearance in the marketplace, the price of solar panels for the power delivered makes them prohibitive for the majority of people in the world (let alone the developing world). </p>
<p>If developing countries were to follow the energy consummation/production examples of developed countries the existing resources would soon be depleted, energy prices would be driven even higher and the economics of supply and demand would drive the gap between those who have energy and those who don't even further. So far no solution has emerged that can cheaply provide clean, abundant energy to people that is not encumbered with an infrastructure that requires enormous capitol investments. </p>
<p><strong>How SUN-E meets the challenge/problem</strong>: </p>
<p>A great percentage of the developing world, exist between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. One of the most significant energy resources ""the sun"" delivers it’s energy in the form of light and heat at its strongest/intense dose at the equator between the Tropics. For people living within this zone the problem is really a matter of collecting and utilizing this abundant supply of energy that naturally exists around them. </p>
<p>SUN=E is a design that collects and focuses heat from sunlight to a single point where the concentrated heat will vaporize water into steam. The steam produced will be vented to power the rotation of a generator coil (dynamo) producing an electrical current. </p>
<p>While none of this is new technology, the ability to scale down solar electrical generating systems from huge sites spanning acres to a device small enough to be installed on a rooftop by one or two persons, is! </p>
<p>The solar heat concentrator is a key component to the success of the SUN=E design. Similar to the shape of a satellite dish, the concave, semi parabolic concentrator uses a mirrored glass bowl, (computer designed) to focus all of the light/heat to an intense point. This intense light/heat will be focused into a chamber where a continuous, measured amount of water (based on the temperature of the point of light/heat) will be sprayed onto the point of light/heat instantly vaporizing the water into steam. The resulting steam pressure generated will be vented to perform work, turning the rotors of a generator/dynamo creating electric current. </p>
<p>A SUN=E system using a concentrator dish 32 inches across will out perform existing photovoltaic systems that use up to 5 times as much space and will cost less and last longer. The inventory of sizes of SUN=E energy systems will vary from units small enough to be portable for wilderness adventurers and campers, to units capable of meeting the demands of home owners, small business and light industries. </p>
<p>SUN=E on its own will not solve our planets energy production. SUN=E is an energy production device that will still require a partnership with other technologies to serve humanity, chiefly energy storage technology (batteries).   SUN=E represents a powerful major step in generating cheap, clean, renewable energy, utilizing a simple low cost design with minimal moving parts. This type of energy generator allows individuals the ability to produce usable electrical current anytime there is sunshine. </p>
<p>From remote areas, to city rooftops SUN=E will improve many societies standard of living by providing a simple to use, cheap energy source. Because SUN=E is not dependent on existing electrical grids, when there are power outrages (on old overloaded grids) SUN=E will continue to function and not drain or put more load on these systems. </p>
<p>SUN=E is an independent, stand alone system! An additional function inherent in the design of the SUN=E is heating water to the point of boiling or vaporization. This allows the SUN=E unit to also provide hot water, and with the proper condensation and filter systems, clean water for consumption. </p>
<p>ENERGY, HOT WATER and CLEAN WATER / these are the ways SUN=E will serve humanity and improve the quality of life for billions of people worldwide. The principles that SUN=E is based upon have been researched and studied. Large scale solar utility plants have been built on these very same principles. </p>
<p>SUN=E represents a new direction in solar energy and in energy production in general. SUN=E is a miniaturized energy power plant scaled down in size, yet powerful enough to provide abundant energy in the form of electrical current for home and light industrial use. </p>
<p>All SUN=E requires to operate is adequate amounts of sunlight/heat, and water. Our goal in creating this energy technology is to provide cheap, clean, abundant energy for humanities needs without generating harmful toxins, pollutants and increasing our planets risk of global warming. </p>
<p>We visualize a major turn in how humanity addresses energy production and consumption as we realize the limitations of our current methods. Advances in design coupled with the rising cost of energy will encourage humanity to demand products that require less energy to operate, reducing the overall consumption per household. </p>
<p>Even though electrical power is the main product of the SUN=E design, for many areas of the world clean water and hot water are outcomes of the SUN=E design that will have significant impact on health and quality of life. </p>
<p>The inability to clean and purify local water supplies results in disease, sickness and death for too many people world wide. The SUN=E design operates by rapidly vaporizing water into steam, resulting in the sterilization of the water. The condensed vaporized water will be free of parasites, viruses and bacteria that are the major cause of illness and disease in developing countries. </p>
<p>We believe that the SUN=E design will empower people in developing countries (between the Tropics) by providing electrical energy that previously was too costly or unavailable, as well as clean water and hot water. People who purchase a SUN=E unit, will own a reliable durable energy resource that they can rely upon for generations. SUN=E will become a competitive energy device that will fill a void that currently exist for most people in developing countries that have abundant sun energy and water. </p>
<p>Because SUN=E is a low tech approach to our energy production needs, the resources necessary to develop the design are relatively low as well. Instead of designing and building huge power plants that supply energy to hundreds of thousands of people, the SUN=E solution focuses on a simple design that will serve a household. By designing a small power plant that is easily manufactured and that utilizes materials that are abundant allows for a cheaper method of transforming water into steam and using that steam to generate electricity. </p>
<p>The financial investment to develop this energy technology is insignificant to the financial return inherent in serving the existing need. The goal is a relatively low cost unit, affordable to a large segment of people. </p>
<p>We project worldwide sales of SUN=E units will exceed hundreds of thousands each year once consumers realize what the SUN=E design will deliver. </p>
<p><strong>Proof of Science:</strong> </p>
<p>The “Proof of Science” involved in the SUN=E design has been studied and verified by several experts in their respective fields, including Professor Emeritus in the field of Physics, Frank Schrabo. Frank Schrabo teaches sustainable design at San Jose State College and has a home that was one of the first homes to incorporate low tech approaches to a “GREEN” design in San Jose. His home has been a model for sustainable design for over 20 years and is open for groups to visit and tour. </p>
<p> <strong>Conclusion:</strong> </p>
<p>Currently there is no one solution that will meet every energy situation. Societies will eventually choose energy technologies that will most adequately serve their energy needs. Alternative energy technologies are becoming the main focus of research by the giants in the energy industry. SUN=E is simply one technology that will have an impact, providing cheap, clean energy for people residing where there is abundant heat from sunlight. </p>
<p>To give people a choice between energy supplied from a power grid, verses a system that is independent of transmission lines is a step towards allowing people to own the means by which their energy needs are met. Owning a SUN=E energy system is a much more cost effective method for providing electrical energy for the majority of people living where there is abundant heat from sunlight, than paying a monthly energy bill year after year after year. </p>
<p>We strongly believe that the SUN=E design will be perceived as the most affordable solution for a large segment of people worldwide. Our main goal is to successfully design, assemble and manufacture SUN=E units for distribution in the marketplace. </p>
<p>We envision serving an ever increasing portion of the energy marketplace, creating product recognition and establishing SUN=E as a standard in the sustainable energy market. </p>
<p>Lowell Rojon is committed to the development and application of the SUN=E design to provide clean, affordable, sustainable energy to serve humanities energy needs, while promoting a healthy environment that we can pass on to future generations.</p>

SUN=E is an independent, stand alone system! An additional function inherent in the design of the SUN=E is heating water to the point of boiling or vaporization. This allows the SUN=E unit to also provide hot water, and with the proper condensation and filter systems, clean water for consumption. 
ENERGY, HOT WATER and CLEAN WATER / these are the ways SUN=E will serve humanity and improve the quality of life for billions of people worldwide. The principles that SUN=E is based upon have been researched and studied. Large scale solar utility plants have been built on these very same principles. 
SUN=E represents a new direction in solar energy and in energy production in general. SUN=E is a miniaturized energy power plant scaled down in size, yet powerful enough to provide abundant energy in the form of electrical current for home and light industrial use. 
All SUN=E requires to operate is adequate amounts of sunlight/heat, and water. Our goal in creating this energy technology is to provide cheap, clean, abundant energy for humanities needs without generating harmful toxins, pollutants and increasing our planets risk of global warming. 
We visualize a major turn in how humanity addresses energy production and consumption as we realize the limitations of our current methods. Advances in design coupled with the rising cost of energy will encourage humanity to demand products that require less energy to operate, reducing the overall consumption per household. 
Even though electrical power is the main product of the SUN=E design, for many areas of the world clean water and hot water are outcomes of the SUN=E design that will have significant impact on health and quality of life. 
The inability to clean and purify local water supplies results in disease, sickness and death for too many people world wide. The SUN=E design operates by rapidly vaporizing water into steam, resulting in the sterilization of the water. The condensed vaporized water will be free of parasites, viruses and bacteria that are the major cause of illness and disease in developing countries. 
We believe that the SUN=E design will empower people in developing countries (between the Tropics) by providing electrical energy that previously was too costly or unavailable, as well as clean water and hot water. People who purchase a SUN=E unit, will own a reliable durable energy resource that they can rely upon for generations. SUN=E will become a competitive energy device that will fill a void that currently exist for most people in developing countries that have abundant sun energy and water. 
Because SUN=E is a low tech approach to our energy production needs, the resources necessary to develop the design are relatively low as well. Instead of designing and building huge power plants that supply energy to hundreds of thousands of people, the SUN=E solution focuses on a simple design that will serve a household. By designing a small power plant that is easily manufactured and that utilizes materials that are abundant allows for a cheaper method of transforming water into steam and using that steam to generate electricity. 
The financial investment to develop this energy technology is insignificant to the financial return inherent in serving the existing need. The goal is a relatively low cost unit, affordable to a large segment of people. 
We project worldwide sales of SUN=E units will exceed hundreds of thousands each year once consumers realize what the SUN=E design will deliver. 
Proof of Science: 
The “Proof of Science” involved in the SUN=E design has been studied and verified by several experts in their respective fields, including Professor Emeritus in the field of Physics, Frank Schrabo. Frank Schrabo teaches sustainable design at San Jose State College and has a home that was one of the first homes to incorporate low tech approaches to a “GREEN” design in San Jose. His home has been a model for sustainable design for over 20 years and is open for groups to visit and tour. 
 Conclusion: 
Currently there is no one solution that will meet every energy situation. Societies will eventually choose energy technologies that will most adequately serve their energy needs. Alternative energy technologies are becoming the main focus of research by the giants in the energy industry. SUN=E is simply one technology that will have an impact, providing cheap, clean energy for people residing where there is abundant heat from sunlight. 
To give people a choice between energy supplied from a power grid, verses a system that is independent of transmission lines is a step towards allowing people to own the means by which their energy needs are met. Owning a SUN=E energy system is a much more cost effective method for providing electrical energy for the majority of people living where there is abundant heat from sunlight, than paying a monthly energy bill year after year after year. 
We strongly believe that the SUN=E design will be perceived as the most affordable solution for a large segment of people worldwide. Our main goal is to successfully design, assemble and manufacture SUN=E units for distribution in the marketplace. 
We envision serving an ever increasing portion of the energy marketplace, creating product recognition and establishing SUN=E as a standard in the sustainable energy market. 
Lowell Rojon is committed to the development and application of the SUN=E design to provide clean, affordable, sustainable energy to serve humanities energy needs, while promoting a healthy environment that we can pass on to future generations.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

NCCO is widely used in many hospitals and public areas to provide you with the best quality air.    b-MOLA GO has 3 filtering systems: HEPA filter, Active Oxygen Generator, and NCCO filter. The system can clean 99% of any harmful and unhealthy elements in the air. This is the same structure used in hospital air purification systems.HEPA can clean solid pollution like dust, smoke, mites, and pollen while the Active Oxygen Generator kills bacteria and virus. Lastly, the NCCO filter catalyzes and decomposes of any odor, harmful gases, and VOC.And the NCCO Reactor filter can last 12 years. b-MOLA GO’s portable and internal battery design make it extremely mobile and convenient. Put it in your living room, bedroom, take it to your office, or even leave it in your car to have fresh air whenever you are. 
The Smoke Purification Testing

 
We used PH smoke pellets to generate smoke. One of these small pellets can last over 40 seconds; making the smoke hard to dissipate. b-MOLA can clean the smoke instantly, which proves it has the capability to clean any solid pollutants such as smoke, dust, pollen, mites, or PM2.5.
The VOC Purification Test



 

 

We used acetone[1] to test the ability to purify VOC. After we dropped the acetone in the beaker, it started to volatilize in the box and the VOC concentration indicated a drastic increase. In the end, the data was stable around 170 ppm[2]. When b-MOLA was turned on, almost all the acetone in the box was purified; showcasing the capability of b-MOLA against VOC and other toxic gases.
[1]Acetone (propanone) is the organic compound with the formula (CH3)2CO. It is a colorless, volatile, flammable liquid that is the simplest and smallest ketone.
[2]ppm and ppb are the concentration units. ppm =  parts per million. ppb= parts per billion. 1 ppm = 1000 ppb.

 
 
The Sterilization Test 
 



 

We used two Petri dishes for this testing. One of the Petri dishes was put in the open area while the other was put in a space with the b-MOLA GO. Then we turned on b-MOLA GO and timed what happened.
3 days (72 hours) later, the petri dish in the open area generated visible bacterial colonies, which means an exponential bacterial growth occurred. The petri dish with the b-MOLA GO, however, looked the same as before. It proves b-MOLA GO is effective in killing bacterias and viruses.
 

   To eliminate the solid pollutants in the air such as pollen, dust, and smoke, b-MOLA employs a Medical Grade HEPA filter. The HEPA filter is a highly efficient shield to trap the particles in and only needs to be replaced around once a year.Put a b-MOLA in any room or car and never worry about allergy season again. With a single HEPA filter, it can capture any allergenic pollen, PM2.5, and smoke for 6 months all the way up to 18 months; the average is 12 months. Just place it in any room or space and let b-Mola take care of the rest. NCCO is short for Nano Confined Catalytic Oxidation. Instead of absorbing the chemical pollutants like traditional air purification technology, NCCO sanitizes up to 99.97% of harmful air and smells. Instantly destroy any room odor and air pollutants with b-MOLA with its patented NCCO technology.  Conventional air purifiers, such as active charcoal, can only absorb but do not decompose of the pollutants. As a result, it can only last about 3 months. Once the filter is saturated, the absorbed pollutants will be released back into the air and cause “secondary pollution,” which can be very harmful to your health. In contrast, NCCO decomposes pollutants and can last 12 years without being replaced.NCCO is so effective and cost saving, it is used in many hospitals, banks, metro stations, and other public areas.  The first air purifier equipped with an active oxygen generator, the b-MOLA Go can kill 99.7% of all bacterias and viruses by adsorbing it into the HEPA filter. Unlike traditional UV-C and OZONE air purifier, active oxygen is safe and can be decomposed by NCCO filters; causing no harm to humans.This technology has been used to protect people from infections in hospitals.   b-Mola GO is designed to be compact and mobile. It’s lightweight, leather carrying handle, and a robust internal battery that can last up to 8 hours of continuous use. When it does run out of power, just charge it via outlet or with a portable power bank when you’re on-the-go.  For your daily and long-term use, we built a silent fan in b-MOLA GO. The noise in silent mode is only 34 dB, get uninterrupted sleep while it runs in the background. It even has an auto power off setting to save power and make it eco-friendly.     Ph.D. students from HKUST (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology) invented the NCCO technology to purify the air they were taking in daily. However, seeing an opportunity for commercialization, the original b-MOLA team introduced it to a greater Hong Kong market.It was first implemented in hospitals and medical labs to kill bacterias, viruses, and clean formalin odors in rooms and bathrooms. The effective result and saving cost made the hospital's client very satisfied. After a few years testing, more than 100 hospitals, metro station, and banks used the NCCO tech to purify the air. NCCO tech in banks and metro stations.After much positive feedback and successful experience in public industry, b-MOLA was created. NCCO technology was then implemented in landfills and now into consumer homes currently. b-MOLA's lab in Hong Kong.   The Production Status We had finished the final trial production in the factory. Now it's ready for the mass production. We will start to produce the first  batch of products in the early of this month. We plan to produce all the units in this month and ship it out at Dec. Risks And Challenges Before launching our project on Indiegogo, we have already conducted two pilot productions as well as send our products to friends and professional photographers for testing and reviewing. We have improved the deficiency of the product design based on their feedback and suggestions.Apart from that, we’ve also built out a specific plan for our manufacturing process. So we have confidence in shipping the b-MOLA GO on time. If there are any changes due to materials, suppliers, or unforeseen events, we’ll ensure that we keep each of our supporters fully updated. Now, we had finalized the trial production and are ready to start the mass production, but we need your support. Your support not only gives us the ability to start mass production and build the best products we can imagine but allows us to continue to work on new ideas.",44.0,3,"1 Campaign

<p>TESTIMONIAL</p>
<p><strong>Mélanie</strong>: Our first year caring for POC POC chickens was a positive experience for our community and family spirit. We are really excited about our second year of poultry farming when we look at the new coop’s heavy-duty design, its lovely esthetics, and easy maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>Dina</strong>: Keeping chickens was the next logical step for our backyard garden. The hens provide pest and weed control, free fertilizer and of course, fresh organic nutrient-dense eggs. I feel good knowing that the eggs we are eating come from chickens that are well cared for and eating a nutritious diet themselves and we have all gained a greater knowledge and respect for where our food comes from. It has also helped us connect more to our community: neighbours and people just passing by are very interested. We are happy to share eggs with them and kids and adults alike have loved coming by to meet the chickens and learn more.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><strong>What guarantee does POC POC offer?</strong><br/>The POC POC chicken coop is guaranteed for 30 days. We’ll pay for the return if you are not satisfied. Of course, the chicken coop must be in good condition.</p>
<p><strong>Where is the POC POC chicken coop available?</strong><br/>We deliver to anywhere in Canada and the USA ! The chicken coop was designed to be sent by mail and easily assembled upon receipt. </p>
<p><strong>How much cost shipping ?</strong><br/>The shipping cost is different for each model and each country. Please refer to the perk details.</p>
<p><strong>How long will it take to receive a POC POC chicken coop by mail?</strong><br/>Your chicken coop will be sent shortly after the end of our Indiegogo campaign. We will send updates for each step of the production line.</p>
<p><strong>Do you supply enough chicken feed for the whole season?</strong><br/>You need to procure the necessary supplies from our certified farms (available in Montréal, Toronto and Québec) or from your farmer. Our starter kit costs $150 and includes all that’s needed to take care of 2 chickens for about 4 months:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 chickens </li>
<li>1 bag peat moss </li>
<li>1 bag wood shavings </li>
<li>2 bags layer feed </li>
<li>1 bag oyster shells </li>
<li>1 bag gravel </li>
<li>1 bag diatomaceous earth</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Will my chickens be fed organic grain?</strong><br/>Of course! All the food we sell on our site is organic. However, we can’t evaluate the layer feed which you purchase elsewhere. You’ll have to check.</p>
<p><strong>What happens in winter?</strong><br/>Red hens are perfectly adapted to winter - even Canadian winters! The coop is insulated for winter, but if you want to give your chickens a bit more warmth we offer a winter kit on our online store. It includes everything that is needed to winterize your POC POC chicken coop.</p>
<h3>
<br/><strong>CHICKENS</strong>
</h3>
<p><strong>Is it legal to have chickens in the city or suburbs?</strong><br/>Chickens are tolerated pretty much everywhere as long as there are no complaints from neighbours. Things are quickly changing: citizens are becoming more and more open to food production in urban environments. </p>
<p>However, as you are pioneers, it is your responsibility to ensure good communication between you and your neighbours. At POC POC, we believe that social acceptance of such a project is simply a question of education and awareness!</p>
<p><strong>Are chickens noisy?</strong><br/>Not at all : no rooster, no racket! Your coop will be silent. </p>
<p><strong>Can I leave for awhile during the summer?</strong><br/>Why not? If you only leave for a few days, you only need to ensure that your chickens have all they need to be happy. You can collect the eggs when you return. </p>
<p>If you foresee leaving for more than three days, it’ll be your responsibility to ask for help so that your chickens will be fed, watered and well-loved each day. There’s nothing a friend wouldn’t do in exchange for some fresh eggs!</p>
<p><strong>Could my cat or dog go after my chickens?</strong><br/>You are in the best position to anticipate the reaction of your pets to your new roommates. However, generally, cats and dogs are more afraid of chickens than the opposite.</p>
<h3>
<br/><strong>CHICKEN COOP</strong>
</h3>
<p><strong>How much time does it it take to care for two chickens and a coop?</strong><br/>As for all pets, you must supply food and fresh water for your chickens every day. Plan also for a good cleaning of the coop each week to avoid odours.</p>
<p><strong>Who designed the POC POC chicken coop?</strong><br/>It was designed by POC POC.</p>
<p><strong>How big is the chicken coop?</strong><br/>82.5 inches long, 44.25 inches high and 36.75 inches wide.</p>
<p><strong>How much space in my backyard do I need for the chickens and the coop? </strong><br/>Besides the space required for the coop, you should have a bit of grass for your chickens to roam and peck on - under surveillance, of course.</p>
<p><strong>Should my yard be fenced-in?</strong><br/>Yes! Consider your chickens as small domestic animals. They should be able to walk around and peck at things freely without escaping!</p>
<h3>
<br/><strong>EGGS</strong>
</h3>
<p><strong>How many eggs will my chickens lay each week?</strong><br/>You can expect 12 to 14 eggs per week.</p>
<p><strong>Will my eggs be very different from those in the grocery store?</strong><br/>Absolutely! The quality of a freshly laid egg is unbeatable!<br/> </p>

<h3>Ne vous fiez pas uniquement à notre parole. </h3>
<p><strong>Mélanie</strong>: Notre première année avec les poules POC POC s’est avérée une expérience fort positive pour l’esprit communautaire et familial dans le quartier.  Avec le nouveau design de poulailler, ultra résistant, encore plus facile d’entretien et fort esthétique, nous sommes vraiment aux anges et pensons que notre expérience volaille sera encore plus agréable pour cette deuxième année.</p>
<p><strong>Dina</strong>: Nous avons un jardin depuis longtemps et les poules étaient la prochaine étape logique. Grâce aux poules, nous avons moins de mauvaises herbes et d'insectes nuisibles mais surtout de l'engrais gratuit et, bien sûr, des œufs frais et riches en nutriments organiques. J'aime savoir que les oeufs que nous mangeons proviennent de poules bien nourries avec alimentation nutritive. Nous avons tous acquis une plus grande connaissance et un plus grand respect sur la provenance de nos aliments. Cela nous a aidé à renforcer le lien avec notre communauté : les voisins et les passants sont très intéressés. Nous sommes heureux de partager des œufs avec eux et les enfants et les adultes adorent venir rencontrer les poules et en apprendre davantage.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><strong>Quelle garantie est offerte par POC POC?</strong><br/>Le poulailler POC POC est garanti pendant 30 jours. On s’occupe des frais de retour si vous n’êtes pas satisfaits! Mais le poulailler doit être en aussi bonne condition qu’à l’achat, bien sûr.</p>
<p><strong>Dans quelle région le poulailler POC POC est-il offert?</strong><br/>On livre partout au Canada et aux États-Unis! Le poulailler a été conçu pour pouvoir être envoyé par la poste et assemblé facilement à sa réception.</p>
<p><strong>Combien coûte la livraison?​</strong><br/>Le coût d'expédition est différent pour chaque pays. Merci de vous référer aux détails des récompenses.</p>
<p><strong>Combien de temps faudra-t-il pour recevoir un poulailler Poc Poc par courrier?​</strong><br/>Votre poulailler sera envoyé peu après la fin de notre campagne Indiegogo. Nous enverrons des mises à jour pour chaque étape de la chaîne de production.</p>
<p><strong>Est-ce que vous offrez assez de nourriture pour toute la saison?<br/>​</strong>Vous devrez vous procurer le nécessaire pour produire vos œufs à la maison sur notre boutique en ligne ou auprès de votre fermier. Notre kit de départ se vend 150$ et comporte le nécessaire pour prendre soin de 2 poules pendant environ 4 mois : </p>
<ul>
<li>2 poules </li>
<li>1 sac de mousse de sphaigne </li>
<li>1 sac de ripe de bois </li>
<li>2 sacs de moulée de ponte </li>
<li>1 sac d’écailles d'huîtres </li>
<li>1 sac de gravier </li>
<li>1 sac de terre diatomée </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Est-ce que mes poulettes seront nourries au grain bio?​</strong><br/>Oh que oui, les cocos! Toute la bouffe qu’on vend sur notre site est bio. Évidemment, on ne peut pas évaluer la moulée que vous vous procurez ailleurs. À vous de voir.</p>
<p><strong>Que se passe-t-il en hiver?​</strong><br/>Les poules rousses sont parfaitement adaptées à l'hiver - même l'hiver canadien! Le poulailler est isolé pour l’hiver, mais si vous souhaitez offrir un peu plus de chaleur à vos cocottes, nous offrons un kit d’hiver sur notre boutique en ligne. Il comprend tout ce dont vous avez besoin pour aménager votre poulailler POC POC pour l’hiver.</p>
<h3>
<br/><strong>POULES</strong>
</h3>
<p><strong>Est-ce que les poules sont légales en ville ou en banlieue?​</strong><br/>Les poules sont tolérées un peu partout, tant qu’il n’y a pas de plainte des voisins. Les choses commencent à changer rapidement : les citadins sont de plus en plus ouverts à la possibilité de produire de la nourriture en milieu urbain. </p>
<p>Mais puisque vous êtes des pionniers, il est de votre responsabilité de vous assurer que la communication se fasse bien entre vous et vos voisins. Chez POC POC, on pense que l’acceptabilité sociale d’un tel projet n’est qu’une question d’éducation et de sensibilisation!</p>
<p><strong>Est-ce que les poules sont bruyantes?</strong><br/>Pas du tout : pas de coq, pas de bruit! Votre poulailler sera entièrement silencieux.</p>
<p><strong>Est-ce que je pourrai m’absenter au courant de l’été?​</strong><br/>Pourquoi pas? Si vous partez que quelques jours, vous n’aurez qu’à vous assurer que vos poules ont tout ce qu’il leur faut pour être heureuses. Vous pourrez ramasser les œufs à votre retour. </p>
<p>Toutefois, si vous prévoyez partir plus de trois jours, ce sera votre responsabilité de demander du soutien pour que vos poules aient de la nourriture, de l’eau et beaucoup d’amour chaque jour. Y’a rien qu’un proche ne ferait pas en échange de quelques cocos bios!</p>
<p><strong>Est-ce que mon chien ou mon chat pourrait s’en prendre à mes coquettes poulettes?</strong><br/>Vous êtes mieux placés que quiconque pour anticiper la réaction de vos animaux de compagnie à vos nouvelles colocataires. Mais généralement, les chats les chiens ont plus peur des poules que l’inverse.</p>
<h3>
<br/>POULAILLER</h3>
<p><strong>Combien de temps ça prend pour s’occuper de deux poules et d’un poulailler?</strong><br/>Comme pour tout animal de compagnie, il faut offrir de la nourriture et de l’eau fraîche à vos poules chaque jour. Prévoyez également un bon nettoyage du poulailler chaque semaine pour éviter toute odeur.</p>
<p><strong>Qui a fait le design et la conception des poulaillers POC POC?​</strong><br/>Il a été conçu par POC POC.</p>
<p><strong>Quelle grosseur est le poulailler?</strong><br/>82,5 pouces de longueur, 44,25 pouces de hauteur et 36,75 pouces de largeur.</p>
<p><strong>Combien d’espace ai-je besoin dans ma cour pour accueillir les poules et le poulailler? ​</strong><br/>Au-delà de l’espace que prendra le poulailler, vous devez prévoir un peu de gazon pour laisser vos poules se balader en liberté et picorer – sous surveillance, bien sûr.</p>
<p><strong>Est-ce que ma cour doit être clôturée?​</strong><br/>Oui! Voyez les poules comme de petits animaux domestiques. Elles doivent pouvoir se balader librement et picorer, mais sans s’échapper! </p>
<h3>
<br/><strong>OEUFS</strong>
</h3>
<p><strong>Combien de cocos mes poulettes pondront-elles par semaine?​</strong><br/>Vous pouvez vous attendre à avoir de 12 à 14 œufs par semaine.</p>
<p><strong>Est-ce que mes œufs seront bien différents de ceux qu’on retrouve en épicerie?​</strong><br/>Absolument. La qualité d’un œuf fraîchement pondu est imbattable.</p>

We believe that connecting to nature isn’t about escaping to the countryside, but doing so at home – wherever home is, whenever you want. We believe that hands-on education will shape tomorrow’s generation. We believe that knowing where our food comes from will give us a better appreciation of the world that surrounds us.

This is the best chicken coop in town.

Modern, durable and 100% designed and assembled in Canada.


Designed to minimize odors
Soundproof and insulated for the winter
Impenetrable and safe
Ergonomic design
Modular structure
Delivered to your home


Easy to maintain: Thanks to an ergonomic and intelligent design, all the corners of the chicken coop are easy to clean.
Ventilated design:  The wire frame allows constant air circulation. No moisture, no mold, no smell.
Made with resistant materials: The structure and its components can be cleaned with a pressure washer and will never rust!
Modular, easy to assemble and customizable: Our coop assembly system is designed to fit all backyards.

It comes with eggs!


We believe there’s nothing more local than an egg from your backyard. Discover, with your family and neighbours or amongst friends, the pleasure of knowing where your eggs come from and how they were produced. We’ll give you a hint: they don’t come in a carton.

14 fresh eggs per week, organic and healthy!
An educational family activity bringing everyone together in your backyard. 
A chance to (re)connect with nature and produce your own food.


It will never smell bad. We promise.

The POC POC chicken coop was designed with the smallest details in mind, to avoid bothersome odours for all... your tenants included.

No roosters…no racket!

Did you know that it is only roosters that announce themselves with their famous “cock-a-doodle-doo”? No rooster means no noise! Hens are more discrete; they simply cluck with happiness as they lay their daily eggs.

Impenetrable, even for the most clever predators.

Reinforced structure, latches and wire frames: even the smartest fox will not be able to penetrate the coop. Your lovely hens will be perfectly safe at all times.

A cosy nest, in winter as in summer.

Polar winds and searing heat have nothing on the design of this coop. The walls are built of smart materials, to ensure durable, quality thermal insulation so the chickens can stay in the coop year-round.

Easy to build

Delivered directly to your home and easy to assemble.

Certified farms
For Toronto, Montréal and Québec residents only (for now!).
If you select the chicken coop with the starter kit, you will be put in touch with a local certified farmer to pick up your hens. These kits also include all the necessary food and litter to be picked up at same time from the certified farms. 
Please note that certified farms are only available in Montreal, Toronto and Quebec at the moment. If you do not live in one of these areas, chickens are quite easy to find in most areas and can be reserved multiple weeks in advance.

Don’t only take our word for it.

1 bag wood shavings 
2 bags layer feed 
1 bag oyster shells 
1 bag gravel 
1 bag diatomaceous earth

Will my chickens be fed organic grain?Of course! All the food we sell on our site is organic. However, we can’t evaluate the layer feed which you purchase elsewhere. You’ll have to check.
What happens in winter?Red hens are perfectly adapted to winter - even Canadian winters! The coop is insulated for winter, but if you want to give your chickens a bit more warmth we offer a winter kit on our online store. It includes everything that is needed to winterize your POC POC chicken coop.

CHICKENS

Is it legal to have chickens in the city or suburbs?Chickens are tolerated pretty much everywhere as long as there are no complaints from neighbours. Things are quickly changing: citizens are becoming more and more open to food production in urban environments. 
However, as you are pioneers, it is your responsibility to ensure good communication between you and your neighbours. At POC POC, we believe that social acceptance of such a project is simply a question of education and awareness!
Are chickens noisy?Not at all : no rooster, no racket! Your coop will be silent. 
Can I leave for awhile during the summer?Why not? If you only leave for a few days, you only need to ensure that your chickens have all they need to be happy. You can collect the eggs when you return. 
If you foresee leaving for more than three days, it’ll be your responsibility to ask for help so that your chickens will be fed, watered and well-loved each day. There’s nothing a friend wouldn’t do in exchange for some fresh eggs!
Could my cat or dog go after my chickens?You are in the best position to anticipate the reaction of your pets to your new roommates. However, generally, cats and dogs are more afraid of chickens than the opposite.

CHICKEN COOP

How much time does it it take to care for two chickens and a coop?As for all pets, you must supply food and fresh water for your chickens every day. Plan also for a good cleaning of the coop each week to avoid odours.
Who designed the POC POC chicken coop?It was designed by POC POC.
How big is the chicken coop?82.5 inches long, 44.25 inches high and 36.75 inches wide.
How much space in my backyard do I need for the chickens and the coop? Besides the space required for the coop, you should have a bit of grass for your chickens to roam and peck on - under surveillance, of course.
Should my yard be fenced-in?Yes! Consider your chickens as small domestic animals. They should be able to walk around and peck at things freely without escaping!

EGGS

How many eggs will my chickens lay each week?You can expect 12 to 14 eggs per week.
Will my eggs be very different from those in the grocery store?Absolutely! The quality of a freshly laid egg is unbeatable!

L'ULTIME POULAILLER URBAIN



Vous  aimeriez produire des œufs en famille? Vous souhaitez ramener un peu de nature en ville? Transformez votre cour arrière en une oasis de découverte et d’émerveillement avec votre poulailler urbain!

Vision


Nous croyons que le contact avec la nature ne se fait pas seulement en partant à la campagne pour la fin de semaine : il se fait chez soi et à n’importe quel moment. Nous croyons que l’expérience pratique peut sensibiliser et former la génération de demain. Nous croyons que le fait de savoir d’où provient notre nourriture nous permet de mieux connaître le monde dans lequel nous vivons. 

Voici à quoi ressemble le nec plus ultra des poulaillers urbains.


Moderne, durable et 100% designé and assemblé au Canada.


Conçu pour minimiser les odeurs 
Insonorisé et isolé contre le froid
Impenetrable et securitaire
Design ergonomique
Structure modulable
​Livré directement chez vous


Design ergonomique : La conception même du poulailler facilite le nettoyage des moindres recoins, qui sont aussi accessibles aux adultes qu’aux enfants.
Conception aérée : La base grillagée sous le poulailler permet une circulation d’air constante. Pas d’humidité, pas moisissures.
Matériaux durables : Le poulailler est tellement résistant qu’il peut être nettoyé à la laveuse à pression et il ne rouillera jamais!Modulable, simple à monter et personnalisable : Notre système d’assemblage du poulailler est conçu pour s’adapter à toutes les cours arrières.

On craque pour la production d’œufs à domicile.



On s’entend qu’il n’y a pas plus local qu’un coco qui sort de votre cour. Découvrez en famille, entre voisins ou entre amis le plaisir de savoir d’où viennent les œufs et comment ils sont produits. On vous vend le punch tout de suite : ça ne vient pas dans une boîte en carton.

14 œufs frais par semaine, bios et bons pour la santé! 
Une activité pédagogique, familiale et rassembleuse à même votre cour arrière. 
​L’occasion de se (re)connecter à la nature en produisant votre propre nourriture.


Ça ne sentira jamais le diable. Promis.

Le poulailler Poc Poc a justement été pensé dans ses moindres détails pour éviter les odeurs incommodantes pour tout le monde, y compris ses adorables locataires.

Pas de coq, pas de… coquineries!

Saviez-vous que ce sont uniquement les coqs qui poussent la note avec leur fameux « cocoricooooo »? Pas de coq, ça veut dire pas de bruit! Les poules, quant à elles, sont plutôt discrètes; elles gloussent simplement de bonheur lorsqu’elles pondent leur coco quotidien.

Impénétrable, même pour le plus astucieux des prédateurs.

Le plus rusé des renards ne parviendra pas à pénétrer ni la structure renforcée, ni les surfaces grillagées, ni les loquets du poulailler. Vous cocottes chéries seront en parfaite sécurité en tout temps. 

Un nid douillet, hiver comme été.

Les hivers polaires et les chaleurs caniculaires ne pourront rien contre la conception multicouches du poulailler. Chaque panneau est composé de mousse en PVC assurant une isolation thermique durable et de qualité pour que les poules puissent y rester toute l'année.

Facile à assembler

Livré directement à votre domicile et facilement assemblé.

Fermes certifiées
Pour les résidents de Montréal, Québec et Toronto​ seulement (pour l'instant!).

Si vous sélectionnez le poulailler avec le kit de démarrage, nous allons vous mettre en contact avec une de nos fermes certifiées local pour ramasser vos poules. Ces kits comprennent également tous les aliments nécessaires à récupérer en même temps.
Veuillez noter que les fermes certifiées sont seulement disponibles à Montréal, Toronto et Québec pour le moment. Si vous ne vivez pas autour d’une de ces villes, les poules sont assez faciles à trouver d’en trouver et peuvent être réservées plusieurs semaines à l'avance.

Ne vous fiez pas uniquement à notre parole. 
Mélanie: Notre première année avec les poules POC POC s’est avérée une expérience fort positive pour l’esprit communautaire et familial dans le quartier.  Avec le nouveau design de poulailler, ultra résistant, encore plus facile d’entretien et fort esthétique, nous sommes vraiment aux anges et pensons que notre expérience volaille sera encore plus agréable pour cette deuxième année.
Dina: Nous avons un jardin depuis longtemps et les poules étaient la prochaine étape logique. Grâce aux poules, nous avons moins de mauvaises herbes et d'insectes nuisibles mais surtout de l'engrais gratuit et, bien sûr, des œufs frais et riches en nutriments organiques. J'aime savoir que les oeufs que nous mangeons proviennent de poules bien nourries avec alimentation nutritive. Nous avons tous acquis une plus grande connaissance et un plus grand respect sur la provenance de nos aliments. Cela nous a aidé à renforcer le lien avec notre communauté : les voisins et les passants sont très intéressés. Nous sommes heureux de partager des œufs avec eux et les enfants et les adultes adorent venir rencontrer les poules et en apprendre davantage.

FAQ
Quelle garantie est offerte par POC POC?Le poulailler POC POC est garanti pendant 30 jours. On s’occupe des frais de retour si vous n’êtes pas satisfaits! Mais le poulailler doit être en aussi bonne condition qu’à l’achat, bien sûr.
Dans quelle région le poulailler POC POC est-il offert?On livre partout au Canada et aux États-Unis! Le poulailler a été conçu pour pouvoir être envoyé par la poste et assemblé facilement à sa réception.
Combien coûte la livraison?​Le coût d'expédition est différent pour chaque pays. Merci de vous référer aux détails des récompenses.
Combien de temps faudra-t-il pour recevoir un poulailler Poc Poc par courrier?​Votre poulailler sera envoyé peu après la fin de notre campagne Indiegogo. Nous enverrons des mises à jour pour chaque étape de la chaîne de production.
Est-ce que vous offrez assez de nourriture pour toute la saison?​Vous devrez vous procurer le nécessaire pour produire vos œufs à la maison sur notre boutique en ligne ou auprès de votre fermier. Notre kit de départ se vend 150$ et comporte le nécessaire pour prendre soin de 2 poules pendant environ 4 mois : 

2 poules 
1 sac de mousse de sphaigne 
1 sac de ripe de bois 
2 sacs de moulée de ponte 
1 sac d’écailles d'huîtres 
1 sac de gravier 
1 sac de terre diatomée 

Est-ce que mes poulettes seront nourries au grain bio?​Oh que oui, les cocos! Toute la bouffe qu’on vend sur notre site est bio. Évidemment, on ne peut pas évaluer la moulée que vous vous procurez ailleurs. À vous de voir.
Que se passe-t-il en hiver?​Les poules rousses sont parfaitement adaptées à l'hiver - même l'hiver canadien! Le poulailler est isolé pour l’hiver, mais si vous souhaitez offrir un peu plus de chaleur à vos cocottes, nous offrons un kit d’hiver sur notre boutique en ligne. Il comprend tout ce dont vous avez besoin pour aménager votre poulailler POC POC pour l’hiver.

POULES

Est-ce que les poules sont légales en ville ou en banlieue?​Les poules sont tolérées un peu partout, tant qu’il n’y a pas de plainte des voisins. Les choses commencent à changer rapidement : les citadins sont de plus en plus ouverts à la possibilité de produire de la nourriture en milieu urbain. 
Mais puisque vous êtes des pionniers, il est de votre responsabilité de vous assurer que la communication se fasse bien entre vous et vos voisins. Chez POC POC, on pense que l’acceptabilité sociale d’un tel projet n’est qu’une question d’éducation et de sensibilisation!
Est-ce que les poules sont bruyantes?Pas du tout : pas de coq, pas de bruit! Votre poulailler sera entièrement silencieux.
Est-ce que je pourrai m’absenter au courant de l’été?​Pourquoi pas? Si vous partez que quelques jours, vous n’aurez qu’à vous assurer que vos poules ont tout ce qu’il leur faut pour être heureuses. Vous pourrez ramasser les œufs à votre retour. 
Toutefois, si vous prévoyez partir plus de trois jours, ce sera votre responsabilité de demander du soutien pour que vos poules aient de la nourriture, de l’eau et beaucoup d’amour chaque jour. Y’a rien qu’un proche ne ferait pas en échange de quelques cocos bios!
Est-ce que mon chien ou mon chat pourrait s’en prendre à mes coquettes poulettes?Vous êtes mieux placés que quiconque pour anticiper la réaction de vos animaux de compagnie à vos nouvelles colocataires. Mais généralement, les chats les chiens ont plus peur des poules que l’inverse.

POULAILLER
Combien de temps ça prend pour s’occuper de deux poules et d’un poulailler?Comme pour tout animal de compagnie, il faut offrir de la nourriture et de l’eau fraîche à vos poules chaque jour. Prévoyez également un bon nettoyage du poulailler chaque semaine pour éviter toute odeur.
Qui a fait le design et la conception des poulaillers POC POC?​Il a été conçu par POC POC.
Quelle grosseur est le poulailler?82,5 pouces de longueur, 44,25 pouces de hauteur et 36,75 pouces de largeur.
Combien d’espace ai-je besoin dans ma cour pour accueillir les poules et le poulailler? ​Au-delà de l’espace que prendra le poulailler, vous devez prévoir un peu de gazon pour laisser vos poules se balader en liberté et picorer – sous surveillance, bien sûr.
Est-ce que ma cour doit être clôturée?​Oui! Voyez les poules comme de petits animaux domestiques. Elles doivent pouvoir se balader librement et picorer, mais sans s’échapper! 

OEUFS

Combien de cocos mes poulettes pondront-elles par semaine?​Vous pouvez vous attendre à avoir de 12 à 14 œufs par semaine.
Est-ce que mes œufs seront bien différents de ceux qu’on retrouve en épicerie?​Absolument. La qualité d’un œuf fraîchement pondu est imbattable.",24.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>Fusion Automobiles is an innovative, forward thinking company who aim to conserve the American way by keeping larger vehicles on the road, converting existing gas fueled engines into bi-powered gas and electric motor powered vehicles.</b></p>
<p>We aim to do this by installing an electric motor to run harmoniously alongside the pre existing gas engine, thus enabling the gas engine to work less, be more efficient, using less fuel and extending MPG.  With our design we are able to convert almost any vehicle into a hybrid.

<p>We are sure you are aware about the importance of maintaining and helping the environment we live in. Clearly fossil fuel reserves are finite it is only a matter of when they run out - not if. Globally each year we currently consume the equivalent of over 11 billion tons of oil in fossil fuels. Crude oil reserves are vanishing at the rate of 4 billion tons a year. If we carry on at this rate without any increase for our growing population or aspirations, our known oil deposits will be gone by 2052. We’ll still have gas left, and coal too. But if we increase gas production to fill the energy gap left by oil, then those reserves will only give us an additional eight years, taking us to 2060.</p>

<p>Our first issue is being able to synchronize the power of both the gas and electric motors so that one does not overpower the other. Our solution is to test in a vacuum by matching the throttles whilst the vehicle is on a dynamometer. Once the design is sound we will test in the real world. </p>

To je solarna energija.Postoji održiv način proizvodnje topline i električne energije iz obnovljivih izvora energije, otvoren, participativan, lokalan i pristupačan svima. To je građanska energija.Postoji selo između planina gdje izvire rijeka Sana, obdareno suncem i prirodnim čudesima, koje je dom dobrih i vrijednih ljudi. To je Pecka.Postoji jedan projekat koji želi da dovede ljude, dobrobit, održivost i razvoj u Pecku, čineći selo ekološki prihvatljivijim i pristupačnijim, kako bi u njemu mogli svi da uživaju; projekat koji promoviše i podučava o vrijednosti prirode i ruralne zajednice. To je Centar za posjetioce Pecka.Postoji jedna nevladina organizacija koja već 20 godina radi u oblasti zaštite prirode i životne sredine u Bosni i Hercegovini, odlučna da podstiče dekarbonizaciju i energetsku tranziciju bh. društva i usmjeri ga prema efikasnijoj, održivoj i decentraliziranoj proizvodnji i potrošnji energije, zasnovanoj na potencijalima održivih izvora energije BiH, kao što su sunce i vjetar. To je Centar za životnu sredinu (CZZS).Postoji i način da se sve ovo spoji, a to je solarna energija u Pecki u okviru projekta ruralnog održivog turizma, zajedno sa lokalnom zajednicom, poštujući njihovu životnu sredinu, promovišući zaštitu prirode i biodiverziteta, te doprinoseći održivom razvoju i globalnim izazovima klimatskih promjena. To je inicijativa koju smo nazvali ""Solarna Pecka"".Centar za posjetioce Pecka i CZZS udružili su snage sa građanima iz cijele BiH, Evrope i svijeta, građanima kao što ste vi, ljudima kojima je stalo do zdravih životnih uslova i života bez zagađenja zraka ili vode.Želimo da sa vama, koji želite da se angažujete i imate svoju ulogu u borbi protiv klimatskih promjena, ostvarimo ovu ideju.Zato pokrećemo ovu kampanju zajedničkog ulaganja preko koje vam pružamo priliku da učestvujete u ovom pilot projektu građanske solarne energije i održivog razvoja ruralne zajednice u BiH.Naš cilj: 6000 $Cilj kampanje je ugradnja sistema solarnih kolektora i panela za proizvodnju topline i električne energije na krovu Centra za posjetioce Pecka koji se nalazi u istoimenom selu nadomak Mrkonjić Grada.Minimalni iznos koji ovom kampanjom želimo da skupimo je 3.000 $, što će nam omogućiti da instaliramo solarne kolektore za zagrijavanje 300 litara vode.Naš ciljani iznos od 6000 $ omogućio bi nam instaliranje i dijela fotonaponskih panela koji proizvode struju. Za instaliranje kompletnog sistema (5,4 kWp) na krov Centra za posjetioce i realizaciju naše ideje potrebno je ukupno 13.000 $, što je naš krajni cilj. Ukoliko ga ne postignemo ovom prvom kampanjom, realizovaćemo ga dodatnim akcijama i kampanjama.Zašto biti dio kampanje?Mnogi su razlozi zbog kojih je vrijedno biti dio ove kampanje i omogućiti solarnu energiju u Pecki, s obzirom na to da energetska samoproizvodnja i potrošnja iz održivih izvora energije znači i ekološku (manje utjecaja na životnu sredinu, povećanu održivost) i ekonomsku korist (smanjeni troškovi za energiju).To se direktno prevodi u društvenu korist za lokalnu zajednicu, kako u smislu više finansijskih resursa za aktivnosti razvoja zajednice, tako i više globalne održivosti za Centar za posjetioce i njegove projekte u zajednici, uključujući poboljšanje energetske samostalnosti i sigurnosti centra i samog sela (čineći ih otpornijim na klimatske promjene).Vjerujemo da je ovaj naš projekat vrlo važan za naše društvo jer predstavlja primjer dobre prakse:- Lokalni biznis održivog ruralnog razvoja, koji promoviše inovativne, alternativne i održive djelatnosti, te nove poslovne modele u ruralnim zajednicama,- Prosuming (samoproizvodnja i potrošnja energije iz održivih izvora), koji potiče razvoj održive proizvodnje energije iz obnovljivih izvora, u rukama građana, u BiH,- Crowdfunding (zajedničko ulaganje), koji promoviše uključivanje i direktno učešće građana u rješenjima socijalnih pitanja zajedno s organizacijama civilnog društva, putem alternativnih modela finansiranja.Možete i vi biti dio ove inicijative, uključiti se i doprinesite ovoj kampanji!

That’s prosuming & community energy.There is a village between the mountains where the Sana river is born, gifted with sun and natural wonders, home to good people. That’s Pecka.There is one project wanting to bring people, wellness, sustainability and development back to Pecka, making it more accessible for everybody to enjoy it, more environmentally friendly, promoting and educating on the value of nature and rural communities. That’s ""Visitor centar Pecka"".There is one non-governmental organization working already 20 years in nature and environmental protection in Bosnia and Herzegovina, determined to empower B&H society’s decarbonization and energy transition towards more efficient, sustainable and decentralized energy production and consumption, based in Bosnia and Herzegovina's real sustainable energy sources potentials as sun or wind. That’s Center for Environment (CZZS)/Friends of the Earth B-H.And there is one way of putting all these together: Solar energy prosuming in Pecka in the context of the rural sustainable tourism project ""Visitor centar Pecka"", with the local community, respecting their environment, promoting nature and biodiversity protection, and contributing both to sustainable development and climate crisis global challenges.

It rolls over bumps, goes up and down hills and carries your golf bag through the entire course — without hassle or sweat. 






This isn’t our first time to the tee. We at Alphard Golf first launched the eWheels V1 in 2017. Since then, we’ve sold thousands of eWheels and received countless raving reviews from users, customers and professional reviewers alike.



 
Walking the course is great exercise and allows you to enjoy the course more, but that doesn’t mean you have to strain your arms and back carrying or pushing your clubs around.No more pushing or carrying means:With eWheels V2, you can have your clubs follow you wherever you go! Or have them meet you at the next tee — all without straining your muscles. Decrease fatigue and focus on your game.The Magnetic Auto-Follow Smart Tether allows eWheels to follow you without a remote! Simply clip and go. The Smart Tether magnetically clips to an included metal belt attachment. It then reads how far you are from your cart as well as your angle of movement and adjusts your cart’s speed and direction to match. The Smart Tether can be easily attached to your golf bag without hassle and communicates with your eWheels via Bluetooth. It’s ready to go out of the box, so you don’t have to fuss over setup.Why not full wireless? With a physical tether, you can keep peace of mind knowing you always have a tangible connection with your cart. You also never risk losing connectivity as it follows you through turns, hills and slopes.The Magnetic Auto-Follow Smart Tether is reliable and always ready for you. Best of all, there’s zero learning curve.An integrated 6-axis gyroscope detects the terrain of the golf course and makes sure your cart goes straight even as it crosses hills, bumps and slopes. The gyroscope keeps your cart going at the right speeds in the right areas and prevents unwanted deviations or tumbles as you walk the course.Powerful motors keep eWheels going strong even as it approaches hills. Save your muscles from pushing or pulling your clubs uphill and let eWheels do all the heavy lifting for you. eWheels also does well going downhill. As the Hall sensors in the motors detect a downhill slope, eWheels V2 automatically sets a nice, even-paced controlled descent. Your gear will arrive safely at the bottom of the hill without risking damage or even a scratch.Need to stop on an incline? The electronic parking brake will keep your cart from rolling down the hill as you chip on.Send your clubs ahead of you while you play the green. eWheels V2 comes with distance timers that let you automatically send your cart 15 and 30 yards out with a single button. If you need some more control, simply use the remote control to steer your eWheels V2 to the next tee box. With a max range of 100 yards, eWheels V2 will have no problem getting your clubs ahead, as you and your friends finish off the hole.  The cruise control feature lets you keep eWheels V2 running at a constant speed, so you don’t have to worry about pacing it. Intuitive steering controls lets you easily adjust your carts direction so it never veers off course. The 4400mAh Lithium-ion battery is guaranteed to last up to 500 cycles — which means it’ll last you years before needing replacement. Each battery is equipped with an overcurrent, over-heat, overcharge and discharge protection circuit, so you know your eWheels V2 is always in good hands.The battery runs for up to 27 holes on a single full charge. So don’t worry, you’ll have plenty of power to spare even at the end of the course.Playing multiple rounds with no breaks? Impressive. You can purchase an additional battery to go the extra rounds.

We have been pioneering the household biogas  industry for seven years,  making thousands of folks become more self-reliant and sustainable. Two years after launching HomeBiogas 2.0 in over 92 countries, we're launching the newest model! It's more efficient, compact and 100% recyclable. Make a closed-loop-system in your household. The New HomeBiogas Generation reuses the same materials over and over again to create valuable outcomes. Read on to learn how it works. 1. Food waste is fed into the appliance inlet2. Bacteria breakdown the organic waste in the digester3. Biogas is created and is stored in the gas bag4. Liquid fertilizer is created for the garden5. Gas flows to the kitchen for cookingGet empowered with a truly rewarding cooking experience! Image turning on your stove top knowing that your family alone has been responsible for providing your fuel needs. Reduce your consumption of LPG and electric cooking fuel, both fossil fuels that harm the environment, and adopt biogas for cooking- its renewable! Every HomeBiogas purchase comes with a specially adapted, stainless steel, countertop biogas stove.    Feeding your system with organic waste (up to 6 liters / 1.5 gallons of food leftovers a day or 20 liters / 5 gallons of animal manure) will allow you to generate up to 2 hours of cooking gas a day. Gas production is continuous and the bacteria never get tired of breaking down the waste.   Besides renewable energy, there is actually another byproduct: fertilizer! HomeBiogas fertilizer contains many beneficial materials, for both plants and soil. Its macro and micro nutrients feed the plant directly, and the organic compounds helps your soil to be healthy and full of life.    Here are some macro & micronutrients found in the fertilizer that your plants will love.  WATCH- New Gen Quick Run-Through  

 
We were overwhelmingly happy with the  success of HomeBiogas 2.0, and the quality feedback we received from our customers. We keep moving forward though, finding ways to improve biodigesters. As Oshik Efrati, HomeBiogas' CEO and Co-Founder says, ""as an R&D-driven company, we will always look for more features to make the HomeBiogas household kit as effective and convenient for our customers.""#1: All black material means that your New Generation will absorb more light and warm the bacteria up more efficiently. The material is also more durable and has a lifespan assessment of 15 years!#2: We've enlarged the digester by 300 liters in height, not width, adding space for the bacteria to digest your waste without adding space to the system's footprint.#3: With less parts, assembly of the system is as simple as can be. Set-up should take 1 hour at most.#4 Because we believe in a circular economy, HomeBiogas developed custom-engineered materials that can be 100% recycled at the end of the product life cycle. You don't need to be an expert to install HomeBiogas, you can do it by yourself! Setting it up is easy with our step-by-step assembly manual, and should only about half an hour.   Choose a location in your backyard for the HomeBiogas system. It can be up to 20 meters from the stove. Then assemble by following our assembly manual.  After assembly, activate the appliance the old-fashioned way, using animal manure, or using our bacteria starter kit. Activation only needs to be done one time, and once activation is done, you will be able to feed the New Gen with your food scraps and produce free, renewable energy on a daily basis! Great news for all farms, eco-centers, hostels and small restaurants- there is a larger size model that is perfect for you! This system treats 20 liters of food waste OR 60 liters of animal manure per day and produce 4-6 hours clean cooking gas per day with 2 steady, strong flames!   ( 4MX1.5M floor space) Add the Bio-Toilet as an accessory to your New HomeBiogas Generation. It will treat your toilet waste (up to 20 flushes) in addition to your food waste and animal manure! The Bio-Toilet connects directly to the biodigester, eliminating any hassle, mess or pests associated with other compost toilets. In this Bio-Toilet Bundle you get the New HomeBiogas Generation biodigester, the Bio-Toilet, the biogas stove and all the custom-built connecting parts for the toilet and stove.The Bio-Toilet connects directly to the New Gen biodigesterWhy is the Bio-Toilet so groundbreaking in the sanitation industry?
Saves 40,000 liters/year
Only uses 1.2 liters of water per flush
No need for infrastructure
No need to be connected to the water or sewage grid
Reuses grey water for flushing 
 The HomeBiogas system performs best and is completely off-grid in areas with a temperature of above 20C / 65F. Winter time in northern USA, Europe, Australia and other countries / continents requires some adjustments in order to ensure 365 days a year of optimal operation. Remember: you can always decrease your waste feeding and pass the winter time with zero intervention. Always consult with us: Support@homebiogas.com as we have so much experience :) The New HomeBiogas Generation is a powerful tool that can help you live sustainably and mitigate climate change! It is an off-the-grid appliance, meaning that it does not depend on the use of any non-renewable power source.  When you choose to cook on biogas that was made from your food waste, you are reducing the demand for fossil fuels, which are non-renewable resources. Mining, processing and transporting fossil fuels take a lot of energy and resources, which is harmful to the environment and is a leading contributor to climate change. When food goes to the landfill, the nutrients in the food never return to the soil. But when you use HomeBiogas, the bacteria in the biodigester will break down the organic matter and convert it into biogas and fertilizer. The fertilizer can then be used to nourish plants, recycling essential nutrients back into the soil.  Local waste management with the HomeBiogas system diverts food scraps from becoming landfill waste. The wasted food rots and produces methane gas which is released into the atmosphere and contributes to global warming. When you use HomeBiogas  you will be recycling your food scraps in your own backyard and recycling the methane your food produces.   Most people have already caught on that going green isn't only the right thing to do, but it also saves you money. Depending on how much you cook,  your gardening habits, and your municipality's waste collection services, HomeBiogas can save you hundreds of dollars a year and have a return on investment of less than 2 years!  What's more?  By up-cycling your food scraps instead of throwing them away, you are FULLY using and taking advantage of the groceries you buy every week. Wasting any food is wasting your money.  We started making biodigesters in 2012 with a mission to make free, renewable energy available to everyone.  Since then, we’ve helped thousands of people to become self-reliant and sustainable.  We keep receiving feedback from our current customers: In what way do you feel the environmental impact of the system?""I feel really proud of using biogas to reduce my environmental footprint. I also help others by taking and processing their meat scraps which would otherwise go to landfill and contribute methane to the greenhouse problem.""""The bins at the side of our houses don’t emit a rotting odour like our neighbours do. We’re using less electricity to cook on our stove. Rather than using different/separate modes of composting, it is all going into one system.""""We are using less LPG. Improved soil and garden. We live on a rocky sandstone outcrop with very poor soil, so I am thrilled with the liquid fert."" What is your overall feedback on gas production and use of liquid fertilizer?""It just works as described on the website. It's simple and effective.""""We use the liquid fertilizer in our aquaponics system - which is great because we now don't need fish.""""Super easy to produce gas from Spring to Autumn. I'm not a regular cook so availability of scraps would go from nothing for a week to heaps with a big cook up. I was surprised by how well the system coped with my lack of regular care. The liquid fertiliser is great. I've mostly just poured it on a new garden bed I put in and the plants flourished. You could see a difference in plant growth between that bed and other beds.

<p>Although most of us have a flower or two indoors, we don’t necessarily realize how beneficial co-habiting space with plants and herbs can be for our health. More than just eye candy, growing greenery inside can completely filter out and clean your air better than any human-made product. With everyday products, plastics, and furniture emitting dangerous chemicals that can actually cause cancer over time, plants are a cuter, prettier, and more natural way to keep your living environment safe for breathing.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543959445/yum1nqkr1a546ldlrf8l.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Not to mention, through photosynthesis, plants take the carbon dioxide we exhale, and turn it back into oxygen for us to inhale. That means, with more oxygen in your living space, you will actually feel more rejuvenated, energized, and ready to take on the day ahead of you. </p>
<p>While converting that carbon dioxide, houseplants also create 10% more moisture in the air as a natural humidifier, which has been scientifically proven to benefit our sinuses, eyes, skin, and other sensitive parts of the body. </p>
<p>Best of all, studies have shown that having plants in your home or workplace <strong>reduce stress </strong>and fatigue while <strong>enhancing productivity</strong>. This, in turn, creates a <strong>healthier sleep schedule</strong>, which leaves you <strong>rested</strong>, <strong>replenished</strong>, and <strong>feeling better</strong> than ever before. What’s not to love?</p>
<p>We know that rearing plants and watering them properly, according to a schedule, and differentiating species can be easier said than done. That’s why only some people have a “green thumb.” We wanted to make this kind of indoor botany as easily accessible and manageable as possible for every single person, no matter their natural affliction for plants. That’s what inspired us to create <strong>Plantone</strong>.</p>
<div>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/022/843/200/e83e68e38a119a4347344f598879174b_original.gif?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1539160281&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=74cd05409156a63f937a9848a5b79407"" src=""""/>  </div>
<p>With its smart lighting and patent-pending auto watering system, Plantone is an all-in-one solution for anyone to safely and successfully grow herbs and flowers indoors. Providing the light that is essential for growing your plants, Plantone ensures proper photosynthesis, which leads to faster growth and more sustainable plants.</p>
<p>Best of all, the Plantone mobile app lets you control absolutely everything from your smartphone, never neglecting the light and water amounts needed for your baby plants again. We know you’re busy and want to travel, yet still come home to some beautiful plants and herbs for cooking. Now you can have it all, right from your mobile device, with the convenience of Plantone.</p>
<p>If you are already a plant parent, or dream of filling your home with plants and herbs one day, then Plantone is something for you to consider. Whether you already know how to care for plants and just don’t have the time, or you’re afraid to try rearing your own plants for fear of killing them, any person can sprout their green thumb using the Plantone – that’s why we made it! Here are just a few reasons why this product will be life-changing:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543960990/lfhiiopgjjyvqpjyia6l.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Since we have accessibility to running water 24-7 inside, we assume our plants want to be doused in water every single morning. For the majority of plant species, watering every single day is not beneficial at all. And, with the rise of succulents and other desert plants as a trend, these plants require little to no water – ever.  With Plantone, you can adjust each auto-pot to control for how much water seeps into the pot. After a quick search via our app, adjust each pot according to the plant species. Now, everything is taken care of!</p>

<p>Sometimes, depending on where you live, the sun can stay behind rain clouds for 10-days at a time. When that happens, your plant is missing an essential part of the photosynthesis equation. Plants need light to create their food and energy source, which means darkness (depending on the plant species) can be lethal. We have built an automatic LED tower into the Plantone that is smart sensor and turns off when natural light is detected. If there is no natural light in your apartment, your plants can flourish off of this synthetic light regardless of the outdoor conditions. Plus, direct light at all times promotes stronger growth in a shorter period of time, giving you your herbs in a fraction of the normal timeline.</p>

<p>Thanks to the water tank that sits below the floater and auto pots, you can fill the tank to the top for up to 60-days of water while you are gone. Using pressurized technology, your pots will siphon water from the tank automatically. As a result, your system will be using water 85% more efficiently than normal agricultural methods. Plus, the securement of the tank will keep the water from evaporating, leaving more for your plants for days on end. </p>

<p>We did our homework. Checked and tested all the scenarios, and got a lot of feedback from test users. That is why we added features that will extend your Plantone lifespan. LEDs emit heat by nature and if they get too warm, they might fail. We didn't want to add cooling fans because they make noise. We have designed a passive cooling system that transfers the heat which keeps temperature at optimal levels. However, didn't stop there and added even more safety features to keep your Plantone working for many years. Plantone have a tiny temperature sensor inside the light tower. It will keep your LEDs from going above the optimal temperatures and eventually failing. So we can guarantee that your LED system will work for more than 40.000 hours. This means your unit will have more than a six year lifespan.</p>

With an automatic water tank, paired with a smart light tower sensor, individuals never need to worry about over-watering or tending to their indoor plants again. Using real-time app technology, users can change plant rearing settings whenever they want, keeping their plants as happy and healthy as possible. When using Plantone, enjoy:


Although most of us have a flower or two indoors, we don’t necessarily realize how beneficial co-habiting space with plants and herbs can be for our health. More than just eye candy, growing greenery inside can completely filter out and clean your air better than any human-made product. With everyday products, plastics, and furniture emitting dangerous chemicals that can actually cause cancer over time, plants are a cuter, prettier, and more natural way to keep your living environment safe for breathing.

Not to mention, through photosynthesis, plants take the carbon dioxide we exhale, and turn it back into oxygen for us to inhale. That means, with more oxygen in your living space, you will actually feel more rejuvenated, energized, and ready to take on the day ahead of you. 
While converting that carbon dioxide, houseplants also create 10% more moisture in the air as a natural humidifier, which has been scientifically proven to benefit our sinuses, eyes, skin, and other sensitive parts of the body. 
Best of all, studies have shown that having plants in your home or workplace reduce stress and fatigue while enhancing productivity. This, in turn, creates a healthier sleep schedule, which leaves you rested, replenished, and feeling better than ever before. What’s not to love?
We know that rearing plants and watering them properly, according to a schedule, and differentiating species can be easier said than done. That’s why only some people have a “green thumb.” We wanted to make this kind of indoor botany as easily accessible and manageable as possible for every single person, no matter their natural affliction for plants. That’s what inspired us to create Plantone.

  
With its smart lighting and patent-pending auto watering system, Plantone is an all-in-one solution for anyone to safely and successfully grow herbs and flowers indoors. Providing the light that is essential for growing your plants, Plantone ensures proper photosynthesis, which leads to faster growth and more sustainable plants.
Best of all, the Plantone mobile app lets you control absolutely everything from your smartphone, never neglecting the light and water amounts needed for your baby plants again. We know you’re busy and want to travel, yet still come home to some beautiful plants and herbs for cooking. Now you can have it all, right from your mobile device, with the convenience of Plantone.
If you are already a plant parent, or dream of filling your home with plants and herbs one day, then Plantone is something for you to consider. Whether you already know how to care for plants and just don’t have the time, or you’re afraid to try rearing your own plants for fear of killing them, any person can sprout their green thumb using the Plantone – that’s why we made it! Here are just a few reasons why this product will be life-changing:

Since we have accessibility to running water 24-7 inside, we assume our plants want to be doused in water every single morning. For the majority of plant species, watering every single day is not beneficial at all. And, with the rise of succulents and other desert plants as a trend, these plants require little to no water – ever.  With Plantone, you can adjust each auto-pot to control for how much water seeps into the pot. After a quick search via our app, adjust each pot according to the plant species. Now, everything is taken care of!

  
 

Sometimes, depending on where you live, the sun can stay behind rain clouds for 10-days at a time. When that happens, your plant is missing an essential part of the photosynthesis equation. Plants need light to create their food and energy source, which means darkness (depending on the plant species) can be lethal. We have built an automatic LED tower into the Plantone that is smart sensor and turns off when natural light is detected. If there is no natural light in your apartment, your plants can flourish off of this synthetic light regardless of the outdoor conditions. Plus, direct light at all times promotes stronger growth in a shorter period of time, giving you your herbs in a fraction of the normal timeline.
  

Thanks to the water tank that sits below the floater and auto pots, you can fill the tank to the top for up to 60-days of water while you are gone. Using pressurized technology, your pots will siphon water from the tank automatically. As a result, your system will be using water 85% more efficiently than normal agricultural methods. Plus, the securement of the tank will keep the water from evaporating, leaving more for your plants for days on end. 


We’re committed to the environment, which is why we’ve created a recyclable product that uses repurposed materials to come to life. We are creating totally sustainable ecosystems that are recycling materials and more efficiently using our planet’s resources to make new (and edible) life. When you use a Plantone, you are giving back to the environment.


We’ve included a transparent mobile app that lets you change settings anywhere in the world. Maybe you selected a setting you feel is incorrect, or want to change settings as your baby plant sprouts into adulthood. Traveling doesn’t have to be a stressful part of it anymore; you can be part of the growing process through your mobile app.

Plantone has four main units: The light tower, auto pots, the floater unit, and the water tank.

The light tower is retractable, compact and space saving. There are no extra parts or extensions to keep around. The single button on the top lets you control the intensity of the light and switch between different light cycles. There are 3 preset cycles by default: Long-day (18h light & 6h night), Short-day (8h day & 16h night), Day-natural (12h day & 12h night)
Plantone Diversity is equipped with broad wavelength LEDs which produce a balance of cool and warm light that replicates the natural solar spectrum. They're excellent for seedlings as well as houseplants, culinary herbs, and other plants. Our specialized LEDs enhance photosynthesis and ensure peak growth.
High CRI rating makes the lights more suitable for the living environment and doesn't strain human eyes, It is completely safe with your pets around as well.


The number 1 cause of indoor plant death is due to over/under-watering. We have a solution for that: 
The auto pots sit on the floater unit. As you fill the tank, the floating action creates osmotic pressure, helping Plantone distribute the same amount of water to plants no matter how much the tank is filled. You can grow your plants without worrying about overwatering or underwatering.
  


With the Plantone mobile app, you can adjust the lights remotely and create custom light schedules. It's totally up to you, for example, it can be 17h day & 7h night to total 24 hours or 3h day & 1h night.Also all light settings are stored in the integrated microprocessor so even if there is a power outage you won't lose any settings.

Plantone Diversity is equipped with a sensor package including temperature, humidity, light level (photodiode) and air quality (co2 sensor is only available with the premium pack). It also has and intergraded WiFi and Bluetooth chip as well as an internal real time clock to keep time for your custom light schedules. 

Canopy supports are explicitly designed for your Plantone: Diversity.  It comes in 2 different sizes. These are a great way to support bushy or top-heavy plants. 
  
We did our homework. Checked and tested all the scenarios, and got a lot of feedback from test users. That is why we added features that will extend your Plantone lifespan. LEDs emit heat by nature and if they get too warm, they might fail. We didn't want to add cooling fans because they make noise.

This means your unit will have more than a six year lifespan.

Culinary pack contains herbs that you can use as fresh condiments in your kitchen for adding that extra flavor to your dishes.

Health pack contains herbs and flowers which have been used medicinally for thousands of years.


Diversity pack provides plants catering to your decorative needs by matching the color profile of a photograph that you provide using the Plantone mobile app.

</p><p>That’s a fair question, and here’s the
simple answer. The Joule caffeine bracelet is a bracelet with a slot for you to
snap on a transdermal caffeine patch. These patches work in a similar fashion

administered gradually for a steady supply of caffeine and energy without any
of the typical energy crashes, jitters or other negative effects of consuming
your caffeine through beverages.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455019751/o9fcqpo85od4efxavc7s.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>We now interrupt your regularly scheduled programming to drop some science on you!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454479013/afqzu2axgwycqj2ie1ah.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Transdermal administration of chemicals, of any type, provides a controlled release through the user's skin as their body heat melts away the thin layers of formulation embedded in the adhesive patch.

These dictate current arable farming methods, in particular ploughing and blanket spraying, which are extremely harmful to the environment. Unfortunately, if you treat the whole field the same, overuse of chemicals is inevitable.Our vision is to automate and digitise arable crop farming. Our innovative and lightweight robots will care for each plant in the crop on an individual basis. They will only feed and spray the plants that need it, giving them the perfect levels nutrients and support, with no waste.And with improved yields and productivity, we can help feed the world by 2030.Thanks to a prestigious Innovation Award from the Institute of Engineering and Technology (IET) we have developed an early prototype for our digital planting robot Harry, which we launched at WIRED Live in November 2018.

Firstly, blanket spraying of chemicals and its terrible cost on the environment. And because we want consumers to trust the food on their plates
Secondly, yield: global population is rising but yield is static
Finally, profit: margins have been static at 1-4% for quarter of a century. 85% of UK farms are currently dependent on subsidies, and it’s a problem worldwide
Solving these is crucial to creating a sustainable future for farming, saving our environment and feeding the world.Today’s problem-solvers have been trying to make farms and tractors BIGGER and better.But big’s not working.Unfortunately big tractors are neither efficient nor environmentally friendly. Currently, 90% of energy to establish crops is used ploughing. And ploughing is only necessary because of heavy machinery crushing soil. So, what do our robots actually do?Our answer is a deceptively simple idea: small robots not big tractors.Our robots are being designed and built by farmers, for farmers, to solve the problems of today and make a bright future for food and farming. We use robotics and AI to ‘digitise the field’ and deliver precision farming.
Precise and extremely lightweight, our robots will seed and care for each individual plant in the crop
They will only feed and spray the plants that need it, giving them the perfect levels nutrients and support, with no waste

Robust per-plant data creates a ‘profit map’ that shows which areas of field to use, which to leave fallow, and what to plant where and when
 And the benefits?
Small robots are kinder to soil and kinder to the environment

They protect biodiversity and enable farmers to be more efficient, more precise and more productive
We can also improve yields by around one tonne per hectare
And give 10x better decision making
And enable permaculture at scale - in a nutshell, ecologically harmonious and sustainable farming, with farmers knowing exactly what is the best specific crop for each area of the field - and what to leave fallow, or put to other use such as for beetlebanks
With robots taking on much of the manual labour, farmers will only spend 20% of the time on the things that currently generate 80% of revenue. With more free time, farmers can diversify, making higher value items - jam and bread, not just wheat - to make more of their farms, create jobs  and drive rural resurgence

 Risks and challengesWe spoke to more than 100 farmers before developing our tech. And the challenges?Adoption
Farmers don’t want to bet the farm, and robotics is a leap in the dark
So instead of having to buy our robots, they will be offered through a Farming as a Service (FaaS) model
No risk then for them to test drive our robots
‘Not invented here’
Farmers don’t like tech being imposed on them from outside
With our Farmer Advisory Group, our tech is designed by farmers, for farmers
Farmers will get preferential shares in our company, so we’ll keep it that way
Mindset
Farmers are cautious and conservative
Robotics technology is a radical change
Tom, Dick and Harry - and Wilma: the ‘human’ personalities of our robots are friendlier and helping them to be enthusiastically accepted by farmers
 Competition?There are a couple of other agritech companies with similar ideas. But we’ve got a march on them.We’ve already got 15 years of research under our belt via Harper Adams University’s Precision Farming lead, Professor Simon Blackmore, which massively accelerates our development. Harper Adams is at the forefront of international precision farming with its innovative agritech robots and its world-first Hands Free Hectare autonomous farming project.Plus we have £1 million of funding already in the bag. And a great management team. But wait, there’s more...
First access to commercialise 15 years of groundbreaking agritech research by at Harper Adams University, the world’s leading centre for Precision Farming
Prestigious Horizontal Innovation™ Award from the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) and the High Value Manufacturing Catapult (HVMC)
Nearly £1 million funding award from the UK government
One patent already in the process of filing, with more to follow
Verification of our robotic farming model target figures by leading farm consultants, Andersons

We've spoken at Mobile World Congress, Agritech REAP, Venturefest, and the Oxford Farming Conference, and this year will also speak at Groundswell, Cereals, Tech for Good and CropTec
Our main mainstream competitor, Blue River, recently got bought by John Deere for $300 million
 What if…?If we exceed our funding target:
With £10,000, we can develop a soil sampler to check for pollution and water run off
With £20,000, we can build an additional Tom robot, accelerating our capability to build the world’s largest living database by a year
With £30,000, we can demo at the leading crop farming show in the UK, Croptec, in November 2018: a fantastic chance to drive early sales
If we don’t meet our funding target, all funding will help take us part of the way:
With £5,000 we will add on extra sona lidar capability to enhance Rachael’s obstacle avoidance capabilities
With £10,000 we will develop a soil sampler to check for pollution and water run off
With £20,000  we can build an additional Tom robot, accelerating our capability to build the world’s largest living database by a year

<p>By the time billions of batteries reach a landfill, they have already created a significant carbon footprint. Greenhouse gas emissions from sourcing raw materials and factory production, plus transportation of batteries around the globe results in potentially hazardous implications for our planet. On top of it all, less than 2% of batteries are recycled. </p>

<p>*Percentage relative to average charge in multiple types of batteries<br/> </p>
<p>This study shows that 10% of the batteries thrown away have roughly enough energy left in them to be considered Unused. 20% of the perceived ""dead"" batteries have, on average, 93% of their energy still left in them. This study further shows that <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">if you take an average of 30% of the ""</span><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">least Dead"" batteries, </span><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">8</span><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">4</span><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">% of energy is still left inside</span><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">. </span>. If the device could have continued to operate at the same rate of power consumption until all the energy was drawn from the battery, the <b>devices could have lasted roughly from 2 times to 14 times longer</b>, based on this study. As can be seen from the actual real life data on batteries that are thrown away, <b><i>Batteroo </i></b>could significantly increase the battery's operating life by tapping into the energy that is thrown away.

</div></div>","The first micro-thin sleeve thatextends the life of your batteries by up to 8x.
Batteroo is the world's first micro-thin sleeve that slips over your batteries and instantly extends their life by up to 8x. The key is that most devices only tap a fraction of a battery's energy. Batteroo taps into the remaining energy that is usually thrown away. 
Batteroo comes in AA, AAA, C, and D variations, and has a micro-thin design to slip over your battery and fit neatly back into your device's battery compartment. The 9V Batteroo will be available next year. 
Here's what the experts are saying! 

 
UL, one of the oldest and most prestigious Labs, has also performed independent Performance testing of a Garmin Golf GPS, side by side, with and without Batteroo. In this test, we can see approximately 6x the battery life with Batteroo. Please visit our website ( https://www.batteroo.com/) to read the full report. 

 
As Seen On: 

  The Technology Behind Batteroo Our proprietary circuitry maintains optimal output voltage.
 

Batteroo is an intelligent voltage management and delivery mechanism device made of thin stainless steel that slips over your battery and fits neatly back into your device's battery compartment.
 
Significant number of batteries thrown away still has a lot of energy left in them. Using proprietary circuitry to maintain an optimal output voltage, Batteroo allows the end device to access the untapped energy in the battery and makes it last longer. 
 

We are happy to announce that Batteroo has successfully completed FCC's (Federal Communications Commission) Compliance testing under the applicable scope of EMC. Please visit our website ( https://www.batteroo.com/ ) to read the full report.

Environmental Impact

Batteroo saves our environment by reducing number of ""Perceived"" dead batteries that are thrown away 

Every year, over 15 billion batteries end up in landfills. If we lined up all the batteries back to back that we use in just one year, it would be 466,000 miles long. 
 

 
 
  

By the time billions of batteries reach a landfill, they have already created a significant carbon footprint. Greenhouse gas emissions from sourcing raw materials and factory production, plus transportation of batteries around the globe results in potentially hazardous implications for our planet. On top of it all, less than 2% of batteries are recycled. 
The solution is simple. Consume less batteries. Use Batteroo. Product Development

Here's a look at where we started and what's to come.  

 
Original sketches of the Batteroo concept. 
The idea actually came to Frankie Roohparvar (Batteroo Chairman), when he was snowed in for the holidays but needed fresh batteries for his children's toys.


 
 

 
 
 
 
  
  
 

Batteroo Prototypes
The challenge was to create a sleeve that was thin enough to fit in a battery compartment, but also strong enough to be reused. 
 
 



 
The Latest Color
The latest sample has a rose-colored non-conductive coating to protect from shorting.


Protective Case Included Batteroo comes with a rugged case to safely store your Batteroo when not in use.

Frequently Asked Questions:

How do I use it? The Batteroo is incredibly simple and user friendly. You simply slip the battery into the sleeve, and leave the sleeve on the battery for the remainder of the time the battery is being used. Once the battery is completely dead, keep the Batteroo and discard the battery. Repeat.
 
Can I reuse my Batteroo? Yes. If handled properly, the battery sleeve is reusable. Please don't intentionally bend or warp the sleeve.
 
Wait a second…how does it work? Good question! Batteroo is designed to boost the remaining voltage of a battery to an optimal level, therefore allowing the device to extract the remaining energy out of the battery.
 
Can I use Batteroo with rechargeable batteries? No, We do not recommend using the current version of Batteroo with rechargeable batteries. We are releasing a Batteroo for rechargeable batteries soon. We will keep you updated!
    
Does the battery need to be ""dead"" before you use the Batteroo? No, you can start using the Batteroo at any time, even a brand new battery, and you will get the benefits of extended battery life.
 
Is the Batteroo available for different types of batteries? Yes, Batteroo will be available for AA, AAA, C, and D batteries. The 9V Batteroo will be available next year.
 
Will the Batteroo fit in my device? Batteroo are designed to be as compatible as possible across multiple devices. We did everything possible to account for design variations of battery compartments and inconsistencies in the batteries themselves. One especially difficult device to account for was the Apple Keyboard, which the Batteroo successfully fits. Take a look here and see for yourself!
 
 Though we have tried our very best, there may be instances where the battery compartment is just too tight to accommodate the Batteroo.
 
You have mentioned the sleeve is made of stainless steel...is there a possibility of the Batteroo shorting? No, the sleeve is covered with a non-conductive coating, which prevents shorting.
 
Is there any concern if a person incorrectly places the battery upside down in the Batteroo sleeve? No, Batteroo has a reverse polarity protection mechanism to prevent any issues.  If the Batteroo is placed incorrectly over the battery, neither the Batteroo nor the device will operate. Simply re-insert Batteroo in the correct position, and watch it start working again.
 
Are there limitations on devices that can use the Batteroo based on the current consumptions? No, the Batteroo sleeve is designed to deliver as much current as a battery is able to supply to the device. 


How much longer will my batteries last with Batteroo? This will vary depending on the device. Batteroo will generally give you the best performance gains with devices that drain your battery life quickly. 
 
What do you mean that we tap into 80% of a battery's unused energy? Where is the up to 8x coming from?With millions of different devices designed by different companies with different specifications for different applications, one number does not fit all. Mileage will vary, and some devices will get more battery life extension from Batteroo than others.Instead of arguing the best design cases vs. the worst, it would make sense to look at ACTUAL data from the field.
Although there have not been a lot of studies on the amount of energy left in batteries as they are thrown away, a very well done study was presented in the International Conference for Battery Recycling by Dr. Rolf Zinniker. He collected ""dead"" batteries from 19 different recycling locations/centers and the resulting experiments and measurements showed the following results:

47%


*Percentage relative to average charge in multiple types of batteries 
This study shows that 10% of the batteries thrown away have roughly enough energy left in them to be considered Unused. 20% of the perceived ""dead"" batteries have, on average, 93% of their energy still left in them. This study further shows that if you take an average of 30% of the ""least Dead"" batteries, 84% of energy is still left inside. . If the device could have continued to operate at the same rate of power consumption until all the energy was drawn from the battery, the devices could have lasted roughly from 2 times to 14 times longer, based on this study. As can be seen from the actual real life data on batteries that are thrown away, Batteroo could significantly increase the battery's operating life by tapping into the energy that is thrown away.

OfficialDuracellUK uploaded a video on youtube that shows how they were able to light up a Duracell Bunny LED light Sculpture using 192 perceived dead batteries. The video states that based on a sample from a UK recycling center, one third of batteries thrown away have up to 67% of usable power left inside. Below is the link to the video uploaded by OfficialDuracellUK. 
Can a bench power supply be used to show the voltage at which a battery stops working on a device? 
Using a power supply to determine the operating voltage of a battery operated device, and then using that voltage to determine the range of voltage for battery is completely wrong. It ignores the internal resistance of the battery. A video as well as a discussion on Batteroo's website addresses the fallacy of this approach. The link is found at:

<br/><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">The Sunflower Revolution </span></b></h2>
<p>     <b>At</b>
Enviro-Design Laboratories, we believe our idea of capturing wasted light
energy is the single most important thing that has happened to the production
of electricity from the sun in sixty years. The idea that eliminates the
weakness of current flat-panel solar systems, the idea that is the first step
in allowing every person on the planet to become energy independent. </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b><span style=""color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"">Thinking Inside the Box</span></b></h3>
<p>    <b> At</b> the
core of our systems are EDL's Sunflower solar panels, which combine our PV
cell technology with a unique reflective material and design to maximize energy efficiency.
But it wasn't enough to improve the panels; we needed to improve the way they
were deployed.  Current flat-panel solar
installations consist of an array of solar panels, all facing the sun to capture
the maximum amount of energy.  The
trouble is, each panel only captures a fraction the total available energy; the
rest is reflected back into the atmosphere. Think how much more efficient solar
installations would be if they could capture and use all that reflected energy.
 </p>
<p>     This insight
led to the creation of the Enviro-Sys Sunflower solar energy system.  Basically, the Enviro-Sys Sunflower consists of a box containing Sunflower solar panels.  Each PV
cell in each panel absorbs the same amount as ordinary PV cells. But the
unabsorbed light, instead of being reflected back into the atmosphere, is
reflected to and captured by cells on the other panels in the box.  </p>

faulty panel, and inserts a replacement panel. This feature eliminates the need
to replace entire solar array systems when one panel fails. Retrofitting an
existing Enviro-Sys Sunflower with new, upgraded panel is also a breeze; the user simply
pulls out the old panels and inserts the new ones.  And because when one panel goes down the
others continue working, users experience no power outages.  <br/></p>

<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""360"" src=""//player.vimeo.com/video/106066753"" width=""620""></iframe></div>
<p>  <b>   The</b> cost
of an installed solar system has significantly decreased over the last 60 years
- but most of that decrease is due to lower unit costs.  Soft costs - that is, non-hardware costs -
are still high, accounting for more than 50 percent of total installed cost.  In 2013, cost of installation was estimated
to be 50 cents per watt, or $750 for a 1.5kw system.</p>
<p>     EDL's Enviro-Sys Sunflower plug-and-play unit 
significantly lowers the soft costs. Users simply place the
unit in a convenient location and plug it into the house electrical panel. Licensed electricians are required only to install the unit’s input plug in the residence’s electrical meter and to validate that the installation meets building codes and government regulations<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">. </span><br/></p>

</tbody></table></strong><p>  <i> <b>  With</b> the information I had gained in hand, I started trying
to make better, more efficient PV cells. I quickly realized, however, that
almost everyone in the solar industry is trying to do the same thing.  Yet despite being backed by millions of
dollars, developers have made little headway in either improving PV cells'
energy efficiency or eliminating the weaknesses of the solar energy systems
based on them. </i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>     So I took another look at what I was doing - and at how PV
cells work.  All solar units
actually absorb very little of the sun's energy - typically about 14 to 18 percent; What this means is most of the potential energy is
bounced back into the sky. ""What a waste,"" I thought.  And I realized that the key to improving the
efficiency of solar energy systems lay not in trying to improve the efficiency
of cells - something that hadn't happened in 60 years of effort - but in
improving how solar panel installations are configured. Why not try to capture that wasted
light energy and bounce it back onto the cell's surface to generate even more
energy? The idea for the Sunflower light chamber was born. </i></p>

a world where everyone on the planet is energy independent.


Where simple
next-generation solar systems generate five times the
power per square foot of today's outdated systems.





Where
you can place your solar system anywhere and take it with you when you move.





Where
we've eliminated the pollution caused by our reliance on electricity generated
using fossil fuel.





Don't
just imagine this world. Help turn it into a reality.

     Your
investment in Enviro-Design Laboratories can help us revolutionize the energy
market by developing and bringing to market the world's smallest, most
powerful, most efficient, most cost-effective, quickest and most easy-to-deploy
solar power system - the Enviro-Sys solar energy producing system, powered by our proprietary Sunflower technology!


The Sunflower Revolution 
     At
Enviro-Design Laboratories, we believe our idea of capturing wasted light
energy is the single most important thing that has happened to the production
of electricity from the sun in sixty years. The idea that eliminates the
weakness of current flat-panel solar systems, the idea that is the first step
in allowing every person on the planet to become energy independent. 
Thinking Inside the Box
     At the
core of our systems are EDL's Sunflower solar panels, which combine our PV
cell technology with a unique reflective material and design to maximize energy efficiency.
But it wasn't enough to improve the panels; we needed to improve the way they
were deployed.  Current flat-panel solar
installations consist of an array of solar panels, all facing the sun to capture
the maximum amount of energy.  The
trouble is, each panel only captures a fraction the total available energy; the
rest is reflected back into the atmosphere. Think how much more efficient solar
installations would be if they could capture and use all that reflected energy.
 
     This insight
led to the creation of the Enviro-Sys Sunflower solar energy system.  Basically, the Enviro-Sys Sunflower consists of a box containing Sunflower solar panels.  Each PV
cell in each panel absorbs the same amount as ordinary PV cells. But the
unabsorbed light, instead of being reflected back into the atmosphere, is
reflected to and captured by cells on the other panels in the box.  
      In addition to maximizing the absorption of the sun's energy, the
Enviro-Sys Sunflower design provides a number of other benefits when compared to
traditional solar systems.


Size 
     Thanks to
the patent-pending design of the Enviro-Sys Sunflower, its footprint is at a minimum 80
percent less than that of conventional solar systems generating the same amount
of power, and it weighs far less.  
Enviro-Sys Sunflower design prototype:
     ·  Dimensions: 80cm x 120cm for total
system
     ·  Footprint:  1m2 for total system
     ·  Installed PV cells: 1.5kw 
Conventional PV panel solar energy system:
     · 
Dimensions: ~ 1m x 1.75m per panel (dependent on manufacturer)
     · 
Footprint:  ~ 8 to 10m2 for total system (dependent on watt per panel) 
     · 
Installed PV cells: 1.5kw 
     · 
Number of solar panels: 5
     The
following video illustrates an Enviro-Sys Sunflower solar energy system for a large
household.  The system consists of two
five-panel ES1.5 units attached to two ES1.0; together, they create a 5kw system
with a total footprint of 3.25 m2. 
In contrast a 5kw system installed with conventional PV panels has a total
footprint of 32.5 m2. 

  



Stability




     Because the Enviro-Sys Sunflower is a cube, it is exceptionally strong
and stable. Flat-panel solar systems, with their large surface area and flimsy
support systems, are far less stable and may be blown off the roof by strong
winds if not properly installed.




Ease of Installation
     Users can
easily install the Enviro-Sys Sunflower in a matter of minutes, simply by placing it on
the ground in any sunny location in a back or side yard, and  plugging it into their home's existing wiring
system. The unit does not have to be positioned toward the sun.  User can even apply custom paint or decals to
the Enviro-Sys Sunflower to suit their personal preferences.
     In
contrast, installing unsightly traditional solar array systems can take
days, as they are typically mounted on the roof. Moreover, the homeowner
must install additional
wiring to connect the system to the house.  
     Both
systems will require a licensed electrician to meet net metering requirements.

Transportability

     For the
first time, consumers have their own personal form of electrical generation
that they can transport with them where and whenever they desire. When Enviro-Sys Sunflower owners move, they can simply unplug the Enviro-Sys Sunflower system and plug it in again
at their new home, where it will start generating electricity instantly.  
     Once a traditional solar array is installed, users cannot economically
move it to a new location. This is a very significant drawback for today’s
highly mobile society, and one that the solar industry, as a whole, has refused
to address. 

Ease of Repair
and Upgrade


     A major
feature of the Enviro-Sys Sunflower is its unique plug-in panel with 'go/no go'
indicators that alert the user if one of the solar panels is not working. When
a faulty 'no go' panel is noted, the user simply opens the lid, removes the
faulty panel, and inserts a replacement panel. This feature eliminates the need
to replace entire solar array systems when one panel fails. Retrofitting an
existing Enviro-Sys Sunflower with new, upgraded panel is also a breeze; the user simply
pulls out the old panels and inserts the new ones.  And because when one panel goes down the
others continue working, users experience no power outages.  

Cost Effectiveness

     The cost
of an installed solar system has significantly decreased over the last 60 years
- but most of that decrease is due to lower unit costs.  Soft costs - that is, non-hardware costs -
are still high, accounting for more than 50 percent of total installed cost.  In 2013, cost of installation was estimated
to be 50 cents per watt, or $750 for a 1.5kw system.
     EDL's Enviro-Sys Sunflower plug-and-play unit 
significantly lowers the soft costs. Users simply place the
unit in a convenient location and plug it into the house electrical panel. Licensed electricians are required only to install the unit’s input plug in the residence’s electrical meter and to validate that the installation meets building codes and government regulations. 



 What Started the Revolution
             I'm Ronald Bracken, founder and chairman of Enviro-Design
Laboratories (EDL) and inventor of the revolutionary, patent-pending.
trapped-light Sunflower technology the heart of our Enviro-Sys Sunflower 1.5kw solar
generator (ES1.5).   

     I didn't set out to create a revolution in solar energy. But
when a friend told me the U.S. was paying the outrageous price of $400 a gallon
for gas and diesel fuel in Afghanistan, and that terrorists were targeting those
who transported fuel,  I thought ""What
a waste of human life and taxpayer dollars. There has to be a better way,
cheaper way to provide energy to the troops.""  

     Solar energy seemed like a potential solution, but as I
started to research the topic, I realized the solar industry was in desperate
need of improvement. A once promising technology - photovoltaic (PV) - had
become old and tired, was stuck in a rut, and hadn't fundamentally changed in
60 years. Was there anything I could do to advance the industry?
 
     I started my process by questioning almost every
knowledgeable person I met, learning about PV solar technology and asking them
what they considered the strengths and the weaknesses of existing solar systems.  




Here's what I Learned:




STRENGTHS


 WEAKNESSES



Users
benefit from lower-cost electricity.


Solar panels
must be installed by a contractor, and installation is expensive.




Solar
energy reduces users' carbon footprint.


Arrays of
panels installed on roofs are flat-out ugly.




Users
are independent of today's energy grid.


The
area covered by arrays is much too large.





Systems
are not easy to repair.





Systems
cannot be upgraded.





Panels
cannot be moved from one location to another.






Homeowners
cannot take their solar systems with them when they move.


     With the information I had gained in hand, I started trying
to make better, more efficient PV cells. I quickly realized, however, that
almost everyone in the solar industry is trying to do the same thing.  Yet despite being backed by millions of
dollars, developers have made little headway in either improving PV cells'
energy efficiency or eliminating the weaknesses of the solar energy systems
based on them. 

     So I took another look at what I was doing - and at how PV
cells work.  All solar units
actually absorb very little of the sun's energy - typically about 14 to 18 percent; What this means is most of the potential energy is
bounced back into the sky. ""What a waste,"" I thought.  And I realized that the key to improving the
efficiency of solar energy systems lay not in trying to improve the efficiency
of cells - something that hadn't happened in 60 years of effort - but in
improving how solar panel installations are configured. Why not try to capture that wasted
light energy and bounce it back onto the cell's surface to generate even more
energy? The idea for the Sunflower light chamber was born. 

Disaster Relief


     The ES1.5
is perfect for disaster relief applications. Combined with a battery pack, the
system can easily be transported anywhere - even air-dropped into disaster
zones - and instantly provide energy around the clock. People can simply plug
in and charge their cell phones, laptops, or other devices.  
     Flat solar-panel
systems are difficult to use for disaster relief as they are large, not easily
transported, require support structures to position the panels towards the sun,
and are not easy to set up. Nor can people easily draw energy directly from
such systems.







Giving Back
     Once
production is up and running, EDL plans to match all Indiegogo donations,
dollar-for-dollar over our campaign goal, with donations of Enviro-Sys Sunflower units to
the American Red Cross and other disaster relief agencies. We feel that this is
the responsible way to give back to the community, as you never know when you
may need their help in the future. 
We wish to extend a very special thank you to the San Diego/Imperial Counties Region chapters for all the help and support they have given us. 


Accomplishments and Near-term Milestones




18vdc Battery Charger - Early Proof of Conceptcompleted 2012/13



     In 
this photograph you will see the last of three proof of concept 
prototypes that were built. Each of the three moved the technology 
forward by solving the objectives in a logical manor. This, the last of 
this series contained all of the features found in the proposed 
production system.  

The ""Big Bloom"" Enviro-Sys Sunflower Proof-of-Concept Model
completed 2013/14

        The
""Big Bloom"" proof-of-concept model is a multifunctional unit that tracks
the output of each PV cell. This model not only proved the mathematical limits
of the output of the Sunflower light chamber but also provided insight and
statistical data proving that the output of the Sunflower is not affected by
how it is positioned with regard to its angle to the sun or to the direction in
which it faces.  
Enviro-Sys Sunflower 640 Watt Solar System
completed 2014/present



     A one-off beta unit designed for harsh environments and
mobile applications, the ES-LC 16-10 is a 640-watt system that employs our
EP-16 solar panels, which will be the backbone of a variety of scalable
Enviro-Sys Sunflower units for residential, mobile, and off-grid use.  

Below is the hourly (8am to 5pm) Volt output measurement of the Enviro-Sys Sunflower 640 Watt Solar System. These measurements were recently conducted in El Cajon, CA. The unit is hand made and 3rd party testing and validation will be conducted in the near future.


ES1.5 attached to ES1.0 unit with a combined output of 2.5KW
                                                         in progress/present

                     
   

This concept illustration represents ES1.5 and the ES 1.0 piggy-backed to form a 2.5 kw system. These are classified as first article production units and will be manufactured utilizing finalized production tooling, assembly components, and processes. Upon completion the first of these units will be distributed to various test sites, including, secondary validation and safety certification agencies.

<h3><b>Mission of YOLK  </b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>After the following success of the Solarade, I established a solar company and named it YOLK. It reflects our desire to supply solar energy to electronic devices as yolk does to the fetuses. Our mission is to bring this wonderful green technology to more people. I wish YOLK can be a bridge between solar energy and people, including not only campers and hikers or early adopters but many others who face battery problems in their everyday lives. I believe that solar technology can relieve the battery problem we face and contribute to making the world greener.</p>

</div></div>","Charge Anywhere Under the Sun For Solar Paper, we’re manufacturing the latest and most efficient solar panel. Because of this, Solar Paper is the world’s smallest solar charger for the amount of potential wattage it can generate.As part of this campaign, we’re offering 5 watt, 7.5 watt and 10 watt, 15W chargers, with 2, 3, 4 or 6 panels, respectively. In bright sunlight, the 5 watt charger can fully charge an iPhone 6 in about 2.5 hours, which is similar to a wall charger. For more powerful devices like tablets or cameras, or for faster charging, you’ll want to opt for one of the higher-wattage versions. (There’s a handy guide further down this page to help you pick the right one. Max power is 15W.6panels in total)Paper thin & ultra lightweight, Solar Paper is just 2mm thin and 2 oz for an individual solar panel.You can slip Solar Paper inside a notebook or plannerHanging Solar Paper on a backpackSolar Paper can recharge any device that charges using a USB cableCompatible DevicesSolar paper can charge almost any device that recharges via USB, including, smartphones, tablets, walkie talkies, flashlights, portable game consoles, cameras, video cameras, and rechargeable batteries. Size & weight comparisonThin, Lightweight and DurableSolar Paper measures just 9 x 19 x 1.1 cm when folded, and each panel weighs only 65~75 (2 oz). Watt-for-watt, it is 70 percent smaller and lighter than our closest competitor. Most importantly, Solar Paper is just 1.1 cm deep, at its thickest point, compared to 3.8 cm for our competitor, easy to carry it!Solar Paper with currencies from several countries.Solar Paper is water resistantEmbedded magnets let you easily add or subtract Solar Paper’s solar panels.Easily Expandible Using MagnetsWe wanted to make Solar Paper as compact as possible and also allow you to expand it in the future if you need to charge larger devices. Our design solution was to create a set of folding solar panels held together using strong magnets with silicon connectors. Only need two panels and want to save some weight? No problem. Just bought a tablet and need more wattage to charge it? Also not a problem. This feature creates unique benefit in economical and environmental aspects. Users don’t have to purchase all different outputs of solar chargers. Thus, it saves resources and money. Furthermore, it solved conventional problem of wire-disconnection caused by repeated folding/unfolding and extend its life span. Clever green design!You can attach Solar Paper on metal surfaces. Auto reset technologySet it and Forget ItUnlike other simple devices with a battery, smart devices like smart-phones and tablets would not accept low current caused by insufficient sunlight. In this case, devices have to be manually reset. That means that users have to unplug and replug the cable every time a cloud passes overhead or you walk through a shadow. This is very inconvenient.We wanted to make Solar Paper as easy as possible for anyone to use, so we have integrated ‘auto-comparison technology’ into the charger, to make it automatically resume powering your devices, after the sun starts soaking it again.Display exact load current so you know the power amount that Solar Paper is generating in real time.Geek Out with Real Time ReadingsBackers from our first solar project, Solarade, suggested that we find a way to show how much solar energy the panel is generating in real time. We thought this was a great idea, because, in addition to being very cool, it would let you see how the panel performs under different weather conditions.For Solar Paper, we’ve included an LCD Amp meter that shows exactly how much current is flowing from the charger to your device at any time. We wouldn’t include this  LCD if we were not absolutely confident about our technology and our product. No false advertising. No false promises.Picking the Right Wattage  

We’re offering Solar Paper in four versions: 

5 Watt      (1 main panel with controller + 1 sub panel)
7.5 Watt  (1 main panel with controller + 2 sub panel)
10 Watt   (1 main panel with controller + 3 sub panel)
15 Watt   (1 main panel with controller + 5 sub panel)
* Each panel is 2.5WQuestion 1: How do I know which is suitable for my device?You can find out how much power your device needs to charge by checking your existing wall charger.The charger that comes with popular smartphones like the iPhone 5, 6 and Galaxy S, are 5 volts, 1 amp.    ( 5V * 1A = 5 Watts )Some larger phones like the iPhone 6+ and Galaxy Note come with a higher powered wall chargers.  10Watt will charge devices quickly and stable.( 5V * 2A = 10 Watts )Charging Tablet like iPad, Galaxy Tab. In this case, you can go with the 10 W+ version of Solar Paper.If you’re charging a device that isn’t “smart”, like a flashlight or Bluetooth speaker, you can use any version of Solar Paper. Lower watts means slower charging.Question 2: How’s the weather?Solar Paper, like all solar panels works best in direct sunlight. If you live somewhere cloudy, (indoor artificial light will generate power, but it isn’t enough to charge devices like smartphones at all), you’ll want a higher wattage version to charge stably and quickly.Many “smart” devices like smartphones and tablets won’t accept low power(250mA for 5W smartphones, 750mA for 10W tablets). This could happen if you’re charging on cloudy days or close to sunset, and your device will display an error message like: “This accessory is not supported.” If you’ll regularly charge in less than full sunlight, consider to choose higher power than your device's wall charger. For an example, I use iPhone 6. Its wall charger is 5W. But Seoul is quite foggy in these days due to pollution. Thus, 7.5 watt or 10 watt Solar Paper is more suitable.Question 3: Am I in a hurry? Higher watts generally means faster charging, and this is especially true when you don’t have direct sunlight. The 10 watt Solar Paper has twice the potential power output of the 5 watt version. (But it doesn't mean that it can charge faster than a wall charger.)

Mission of YOLK  

After the following success of the Solarade, I established a solar company and named it YOLK. It reflects our desire to supply solar energy to electronic devices as yolk does to the fetuses. Our mission is to bring this wonderful green technology to more people. I wish YOLK can be a bridge between solar energy and people, including not only campers and hikers or early adopters but many others who face battery problems in their everyday lives. I believe that solar technology can relieve the battery problem we face and contribute to making the world greener.


YOLK's solar modules. We have technology to customize solar cells.
YOLK is a solar company specialized in high quality solar modules and panels. While we produce our own products like Solarade(2014) and Solar Paper(2015). We also supplied customized solar modules on client’s demands. Solar modules are mainly used for iot & ict devices.


YOLK team 
After graduating from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago with BFA emphasis in design object, I have created nolla design studio to continue doing what I love and do best: making things. After the first solar charger project, Solarade, I was attracted by the synergy of technology and design. So I founded a solar charger company, YOLK. YOLK is a small company for now, but this team has the world's top solar techonology and a vision to spread this wonderful green technology to everyone's daily life. You will find the most innovative and advanced solar products at YOLK.

Food Wrap easily wraps your food items exactly like cling wrap! But, when you're done, you can place it in the dishwasher (or hand wash) and reuse over and over again for years to come! How great is that!?    Not only is Food Wrap the first practical reusable solution to cling warp, but it also solves many cooking issues. Food Wrap can completely replace Baking Paper and Tin Foil as well!Food Wrap is heat resistant to 235 degrees Celsius or 445 degrees Fahrenheit. That means you can use Food Wrap in the oven, on the stove and even in the microwave. You can bake with it, cook with it, steam with and use it for almost any other use you can find for normal Baking Paper and Tin Foil.  Food Wrap does all of this without producing any harmful chemicals or residues. The Food Wrap material is 100% FDA approved! It is a BPA Free, high quality silicone made especially with your health in mind.   So what else can it do? On top of being able to wrap your lunch, fruit and other snacks, Food Wrap can also be used as an all-purpose lid. When stretched over a plate, bowl or container correctly, Food Wrap creates and airtight seal, meaning your food stays fresher in the fridge than when you used cling wrap!    Food Wrap is pretty amazing stuff! It's easy to store as well, just fold it into quarters and stack in a draw or cupboard!   And to top it all off, Food Wrap is super strong and durable. You can pull it to 3 times its size! When used correctly, it will never tear, break or rip!   Why is Food Wrap so amazing? 
Made from 100% BPA free, FDA approved high grade silicone!
Unique Patent-Pending design 
100% plastic FREE packaging! 
Infinitely washable and reusable 
Replaces the need for Cling Wrap, Baking Paper, Tin Foil and buying new container lids!
Keeps your food fresh!
Creates an airtight seal on your plates, bowls and containers to keep your food sealed and fresh for longer! 
Can be placed in the oven, microwave and stove top in temperatures up to 235 degrees Celsius or 445 degrees Fahrenheit.
Freezer friendly!
Stain Resistant 
Comes in the perfect 'wrapping' and 'covering' dimensions, 40cm x 30cm x 1mm (16 inches x 12 inches x 0.04 inches) 
Super strong and durable! Can be stretched to 3x its size! 
Saves the environment! 
    Food Wrap is super easy to use! If you're using Food Wrap to wrap a sandwich, fruit or any other food item, you simply use it just as you would normal cling wrap! Super easy! It’s the same as you're used to, but you can wash it and reuse it over and over again!    How to use Food Wrap on a Plate, Bowl or Container  First, place your Food Wrap evenly over the container, being sure to cover all sides Second, make sure to 'grip' the back side of the container and stretch the Food Wrap over the container, making sure all edges are evenly covered   Then, just make sure all sides are even and that there are no air holes along the side of the container Finally, just release the air by gently pushing down in the middle of the wrap over the container. This will release air and ensure an airtight seal has been achieved.         Food Wrap has unlimited potential uses in the kitchen. From wrapping food items, to being used as a lid or airtight container cover, to being used in your everyday cooking! The uses are endless!   Wrap a Burrito or Wrap Cover a Plate and Food Wrap a Melon Wrap a Sandwich Use Food Wrap to Cook in the Microwave  Store leftovers in the Fridge Use to cook in the oven in replacement of Baking Paper or Tin Foil Wrap and Cover anything! Any size, any shape!  The potential uses for Food Wrap are endless :)    Food Wrap comes in 2 pack types. 4 Pack - Green, Red, Blue and Yellow 3 Pack - All Clear  The PackagingThis here is our first draft of the packaging.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are a group of Transition Year students from Wilsons Hospital School located in Westmeath, Ireland. We are passionate about our environment and want to promote eco-friendly initiatives through better understanding of green energy technologies.</p>
<p>As part of our Transition Year program, we are undertaking a Product Design and Development module aimed at providing training to young people in basic engineering principles. The module requires that we adopt a project-led approach to tackling an engineering design challenge over a defined period.  </p>
<p>We have decided to start with an electric vehicle project, as we believe that with greater knowledge of how electric propulsion systems work, as the engineers and consumers of tomorrow we can make more informed choices about which technologies we employ in transitioning towards a more sustainable and eco-friendly future.</p>
<p>We have procured a donor project 2-seater Utility-Terrain-Vehicle (UTV), formerly powered by a 260cc petrol engine. It is our intention to carry out a ground up restoration of the UTV and specify and fit a suitable electric motor to convert it to an electric UTV (eUTV).</p>
<p>The primary costs related to the project are expected to be associated with purchase of the electric motor, batteries, and battery charger along with materials required as part of the restoration process. We hope to fund these project costs through donations from interested individuals and local businesses by way of either a crowdfunding and/or sponsorship model.  </p>
<p>Your support as project donors will be critical to our success, allowing us to harvest the full scope of learning opportunity available and to perhaps inspire our team to become the young engineers and entrepreneurs of tomorrow.​</p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Funding requirements are broken down as follows:</p>
<p>Electric motor €1000</p>
<p>Batteries @1200</p>
<p>Battery charger €100</p>
<p>Materials (Replacement parts, paint, custom fabrication) €300</p>
<p>TOTAL FUNDING REQUIREMENT = €2600</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are taking on this project as a learning opportunity to enhance our knowledge of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Green Energy Technologies (with particular focus on Electrical Propulsion Systems).</li>
<li>Basic Automotive Engineering. </li>
<li>Introduction to company structures and the roles allocated to different departments (e.g. Engineering, Operations, Sales and Marketing, Finance) as well as the cross functional role of Project Management. </li>
<li>Engineering design constraints requiring tradeoffs between project scope, budget and timeline.</li>
<li>Company financing including choosing the appropriate funding model for a new start-up. </li>
<li>Learning safe and responsible use of Social Media for the purposes of product promotion through sales and marketing initiatives.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>We are also keen to better understand how technology can make a difference in shaping a more eco-friendly world and to use this knowledge to help influence a more sustainable way of life. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is an ambitious project and as such it carries a number of risks and challenges. We have anticipated the main challenges as follows:</p>

<ul><li>Funding does not reach the required target</li></ul>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>We have specified a reasonably sophisticated battery pack and motor, but could scale this back for the initial proof of concept to reduce costs in line with available funding if required.

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We greatly appreciate any contribution, big or small!

<strong>New Wardenclyffe</strong> Tribute<strong> to Tesla</strong>
</h3>
<h3><em>100 Years ago , a genius inventor named Nikola Tesla, wanted to give EVERYONE FREE ENEGRY, FOREVER! Tesla's dreams were crushed by greedy monopolistic giants of the oil industry. Since then, we and our Mother Earth has suffered pollution and destruction of our environment. </em></h3>
<p><em>Nikola Tesla held over 700 patents and over 1400 inventions world wide including AC electricity, inductive brushless motors, neon and fluorecent lights, radio tranmission, remote control, Tesla coils and many, many other fascinating electrical devices! </em></p>
<p>I'm planning to rebuild Tesla's Wardenclyffe tower to provide free WIRELESS energy to everyone!</p>
<p>I, along with my dad, have been studying ""free energy"" concepts and devices for several years now. We have studied much of Tesla's work and patents and have even recreated some of his experiments and work. My dad has degrees in electronics and computers. I'm a creative and resourceful thinker, researcher and developer with a passion to help people. With free wireless energy transmission, it would greatly improve the quality of life for billions of people all around the world! Literally, billions of people don't have access to clean water, lighting, refrigeration or cooking because of lack of power. TOGETHER, we change change this! We can bring in a New Golden Age of peace, happiness and abundance for ALL of humanity!</p>
<p>In the early 1900's, Tesla was building the Wardenclyffe tower in Shoreham, Long Island New York. Greedy millionaire, J.P. Morgan was funding the project which he believed was going to be a radio transmission tower. Tesla discovered that he could wirelessly transmit electrical power with the tower. Excited, Tesla went to J.P. Morgan and told him the ""great news"" that everyone...everywhere could have FREE electricity, Morgan became furious sputtering, ""How can you put a meter on it?!"" Tesla's tower was soon destroyed and Tesla was ridiculed into obscurity destined to die a lonely old man in a hotel room in New York.       </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We need to recreate the Wardenclyffe tower! Tesla's real secret is that the Wardenclyffe was a prototype model for a larger tower! But his biggest secret was that these towers would produce Aetheric/Ether energy and therefore increasing the vibrational frequency of the whole planet allowing us higher states of conciousness physically, emotionally and spiritually!</p>
<p>I have not only studied Tesla's work extensively, but also closely follow the work of other brilliant Electrical Engineers such as Eric Dollard, Peter Lindemann and Thomas Joseph Brown. I am also currently in contact with a gentleman in Croatia, homeland of Nikola Tesla who happens to work at the Tesla museum in Belgrade. He has exclusive access to all of Tesla's personal notes and books and has studied them closely, coming up with a FULL description and plans for how the Wardenclyffe works! I understand how it all works as well, but it would be a great honor to work with him as well.</p>
<p><strong>What we need and what you get!</strong></p>
<p>Initially, we need funding, first and foremost in oder to aquire test equipment and research &amp; development supplies. Also, we would like to secure a piece of property as soon as possible to start building a labaratory for the New Wardenclyffe tower. The lab will be funded by the people who contrubute, so it will be for ""We the People"", which means ALL of humanity! This could be the biggest turning point  in human history, become a part of history in the making! All funding contributors will have exclusive access by permission, to experiment and build in the lab and their name written on a plaque honoring them for their generous contribution. All contributors will be welcome to visit and explore free of charge. All contributors and volunteers will be commended in social networks for their generous contributions!  </p>
<p>The total estimated cost is $4,900,000 to complete the New Wardenclyffe tower. The tower itself is 187 feet and the grounding structure is 420 feet deep! The lab itself needs to be some distance away from the tower because otherwise sparks like to ""play"" in the lab, as Tesla put it. I plan to have a Tesla Science Discovery Center as well for people to learn about Tesla and try some of Tesla's inventions!</p>
<p>This project, New Wardenclyffe could change the world as we know it and make the power grid, nuclear and oil based fuels obsolete and improve the quality of life for everyone! Let's make Tesla's dream OUR reality!</p>
<p>Of course people will ask questions...$50,000 is just Phase 1 of my campaign...$50,000 will help to buy the property to build the Tesla Tech lab. I estimate the lab will cost $150,000-$250,000 all together. <br/><br/>I estimate that it will cost about $4.5 million to build the tower itself. The location is somewhat important as Ley lines are better, but remember, Tesla did his most profound experiments in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Tesla chose this spot to research natural electrical phenomenon...lightening. Tesla literally electrified the ground for 25-31 miles all around!!! And NOBODY has reproduced that kind of experiment...NOBODY!!! Eric Dollard is a super genius and one of my favorite people in EE! Eric has a heart of gold and I love that guy!  I follow his work closely and I am friends with his team! (Eric is kind of a loner, so I try not to contact him directly. I don't want to intrude.) I have watched and read A LOT of Borderlands Science's work. I'm very familiar with Peter Lindemann and learned from Peter's book, ""The Secrets of Cold Electricity""! With the help of his book, my dad and I WIRELESSLY transmitted Cold Electricity about 10 feet across our living room! That was about 5 years ago and I really wish I had a video to prove it! So, you'll have to just take my word for it, I guess... I'm also friends with Thomas Joseph Brown as well. He and I chat about physics and natural archetypes of energies.                                 </p>
<p>Eric Dollard is a great man and I have the utmost love and respect for him! I'm not by any means trying to ""step on his toes"" at all, but Eric Dollard IS very inspiring to me and maybe the reason that I would have any chance of success. Tesla is and always will be my main inspiration of course, but if anyone can build a new Wardenclyffe, it is Eric Dollard! BUT....IF he does NOT succeed, then shall we wait another 100 years??? I say, ""HELL NO!!!"" We need people all over the world trying to do the same!!! I will share ALL the secrets I discover for ALL OF HUMANITY!!! Let's free the world with FREE ELECTRICITY FOR EVERYBODY!!! </p>
<p>If you can't contribute funds, then that's okay! There are other ways that you can help too! ""Share"" with your friends and family! Indiegogo also has ""share"" tools!</p>
<p>I will keep everybody posted on the progress! You can follow New Wardenclyffe Tribute to Tesla on Facebook. There's tons of valuable info on my page!</p>

</div></div>","The Windjoule micro wind machine - WIN 5WINDJOULE is a high output device which has been designed to capture the low average wind speeds which are typical in populated areas. (all over the World)
The WIN 5 is simple and slow revving causing less visual and environmental impact than a traditional turbine.    
It maximises the available local wind resource, taking advantage of the free and sustainable energy contained in the wind which is all around us.The WIN 5 is extremely compact making it possible to cluster machines in small spaces as close as possible to the point of use. ( 15m ht )Future developments include smaller versions which are intended to be mobile for remote temporary deployment and an emergency relief version built into a shipping container. The unique low level and compact nature of the device makes this possible.
WINDJOULE products could be manufactured under licence anywhere in the World. Further helping to reduce the overall environmental impact of the energy produced and creating local manufacturing jobs.

The funds will be used to manufacture and assemble a full-size, fully-functioning Windjoule prototype machine, utilising production quality materials (composites, metals and sailcloth) and high quality components (alternator, gearbox).
The funds will support the associated testing and design optimization activities, in order to ensure that the electricity generating capabilities of the prototype are maximised.
Also covered is the administrative support work and the forward planning for subsequent phases of Windjoule development, including on-site installation, technical certification, partnership working, design rights protection and commercial development under a global manufacturing licensing model.

Why You Should Back Us

Windjoule can be a part of the solution to address the global problem of providing clean energy at a viable cost, to meet an ever-expanding demand.
Due to its compact size, Windjoule has a significantly reduced environmental impact, when compared to other energy solutions.
Windjoule has the potential for quick deployment in a wide range of locations.
The potential for local manufacturing will further reduce the environmental impact of energy production.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p style=""text-align: center;"">*We are not making any specific claims that Eco Gloves will cure, treat, or in itself prevent anyone from being infected with COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

</div></div>","The world is changing, and now more than ever we need to be vigilant about the things we touch and the germs we get exposed to doing everyday activities. That’s why we bring you Eco Gloves, the first individually packed eco-friendly gloves that helps protect you against germs and messes on the go.  
 




 

 



 

 


 
Individually Packed for Convenience
Eco Gloves come individually wrapped so they're convenient to take with you anywhere you go. With 24 pairs packed in these convenient sized packets, you can stash them in your pocket, backpack, purse, and even wallet.   
 


 
Take them Anywhere, Anytime
You can take them anywhere and it takes less effort to put on and clean up than with hand sanitizer. Unlike other solutions, that are bulky and are a hassle to carry around, or ones that can leak and spill in your pocket, Eco Gloves is small, lightweight, hassle-free and mess-free.  


 
Prevent the Spread of Germs 
We know that clean hands save lives and that good hand hygiene is more important now than ever. That's why we created individually packed Eco Gloves so you can take them on the go and protect yourself anywhere you go. 
 

 
They’re the perfect solution to help you avoid direct contact with shared surfaces such as door handles, gas pumps, ticket counter touchscreens, and shopping carts, by providing a physical barrier between you and the things you touch. 
 
Protect your hands
Eco Gloves provide the physical barrier you need to protect your hands from chemicals and harsh cleaning agent during cleaning tasks, keeping your hands in tip top shape.    


 
A Physical Barrier 
While hand sanitizers can clean you hands, Eco Gloves provide a physical barrier between you and the things you touch blocking you from any possible germs.  

 
Better than Other Solutions 
Eco Gloves is the first individually packed eco friendly glove on the market. Regular gloves come in very large big boxes making it a hassle to carry.   

 
Eco-Friendly & Sustainable 
We are changing the glove industry! Did you know that across child care centers, cleaning businesses, medical facilities and food industries as many as 30 pairs of gloves are used per job per day? Now that can add up! What if there was a more eco-friendly alternative that would give the same results but put less strain on the environment and waste production in the world? Now there is with Eco Gloves.  
 
Regular plastic gloves stay in landfills for thousands of years and are harmful to fish and wildlife if they end up in the ocean. Eco Gloves are made from annually renewable plant-based resources that can break down through composting, reducing environmental pollution. Eco Gloves make it convenient for you to stay clean on the go while being environmentally friendly.
 
Strong, Durable & Unpenetrable
Unlike other eco-friendly products out there, Eco Gloves is made with premium plant-based materials and won’t rip, tear or disintegrate before you start using it. In fact, they look and feel just like plastic, but they won’t take decades to decompose, helping to keep our landfills, seas and the entire planet plastic free.

<p>Meet the GRENGINE™, the little engine that can. Here at Growing Greener Innovations, we look to change the world of portable energy with this silent and emission-free solar generator; the only system in the world capable of replacing the standard gasoline operated generators, which are poisoning the world with millions of tons of Greenhouse Gases and Carbon Monoxide every year.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479856555/h1h7eq9jtf4nm7fobqm5.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The GRENGINE’s patent pending system uses stackable and interchangeable batteries to deliver a knockout punch to the gasoline generator. The formula that has made gas generators the long-standing winner in industrial use, has been the ease of topping up fuel, compared with waiting for batteries to recharge.  Until now. With the GRENGINE™ you can switch batteries even easier than refilling a gas tank.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483635006/gbpnhi8x0jjbjahnhwyr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Effective changes are made gradually. Viable and significant improvement takes time, so our mission is to take meaningful steps toward a more sustainable future. We develop and support environmentally conscious technology, with the objective of continually making our planet greener.</p>
<p>The GRENGINE™ is constructed to last more than 2000 cycles.  It is also compartmentalized, allowing us to recycle only the battery when it does see the end of its life, as opposed to trashing the whole unit.  We’ve designed it to be easy to use so that widespread adoption is inevitable; with widespread adoption comes lasting environmental impact.  We can remove millions of tons of greenhouse gases with the GRENGINE™! </p>

<p>Our interchangeable and stackable battery system has changed the game for portable power solutions. Because you can buy and stack as many batteries as you need, you'll always be powered with GRENGINE™.  Charge your backup battery from a wall outlet or a solar panel while you use your GRENGINE™ or stack them up for more watt hours.  Because it is component based, you can recycle only the battery, as opposed to having to replace the whole unit.  We've designed the system for ease of use; simply clip your battery in and go! </p>

</div></div>","Never sit in the dark in silence again!  Use the GRENGINE™ to provide you with your in home backup.  It has zero emissions, making it perfectly safe to store and use indoors!

It's completely silent and emission free; the perfect companion for a weekend camping getaway.

You  can use the GRENGINE™ for a variety of light duty corded tools or keep your cordless tool batteries charged up, whether on the jobsite or as DIY project.

Show a late night movie in the woods! Or simply have silent power available for your next outdoor event, whether it's a wedding, a photo shoot, or your niece's 12th birthday extravaganza.

When you take the GRENGINE™ on the road, you'll never be stranded waiting for a tow.  The built in jumpstarter will keep your trip moving along!

Each battery (which weighs only 12 lbs) is the power equivalent of a 12V 100 Amp hour lead acid battery (which typically weighs 85 lbs). This means that with the appropriate adaptor, the GRENGINE™ batteries can be used to power almost anything currently operating on lead acid. We have plans to extend our GRENGINE™ system to include lawn mowers, water pumps, snow blowers, and so much more. 
 
Take power where you need it.  The GRENGINE™ is totally silent and fume free, so use it when and where you want to.  Need emergency backup?  Going camping?  Need power for a trade show presentation?  Because it produces no noise and no fumes, the GRENGINE™ is both safe to use indoors and its use will not be restricted on any outdoor adventure.


As seen in:
  
   

     
 
Meet the GRENGINE™, the little engine that can. Here at Growing Greener Innovations, we look to change the world of portable energy with this silent and emission-free solar generator; the only system in the world capable of replacing the standard gasoline operated generators, which are poisoning the world with millions of tons of Greenhouse Gases and Carbon Monoxide every year.

The GRENGINE’s patent pending system uses stackable and interchangeable batteries to deliver a knockout punch to the gasoline generator. The formula that has made gas generators the long-standing winner in industrial use, has been the ease of topping up fuel, compared with waiting for batteries to recharge.  Until now. With the GRENGINE™ you can switch batteries even easier than refilling a gas tank.


Effective changes are made gradually. Viable and significant improvement takes time, so our mission is to take meaningful steps toward a more sustainable future. We develop and support environmentally conscious technology, with the objective of continually making our planet greener.
The GRENGINE™ is constructed to last more than 2000 cycles.  It is also compartmentalized, allowing us to recycle only the battery when it does see the end of its life, as opposed to trashing the whole unit.  We’ve designed it to be easy to use so that widespread adoption is inevitable; with widespread adoption comes lasting environmental impact.  We can remove millions of tons of greenhouse gases with the GRENGINE™! 




The GRENGINE™ 1000 is perfect to run or charge a variety of tools or toys.  From cellphones to refrigerators and everything in between, the GRENGINE™ will keep you going no matter where you are.

 
 
 
 

Our interchangeable and stackable battery system has changed the game for portable power solutions. Because you can buy and stack as many batteries as you need, you'll always be powered with GRENGINE™.  Charge your backup battery from a wall outlet or a solar panel while you use your GRENGINE™ or stack them up for more watt hours.  Because it is component based, you can recycle only the battery, as opposed to having to replace the whole unit.  We've designed the system for ease of use; simply clip your battery in and go! 

 
With the ability to stack as many batteries as you need, the possibilities are virtually endless.  Stock up on battery packs and your run times become unlimited.  


 
Why GRENGINE™  1000 vs. Solar Generator Competition? 
•Only generator in its class with expandable battery technology for longer usage 
•More cost efficient: 80% less expensive than industry leader when calculated by cost per use 
•Easier to carry: Approximately 1/4 the weight of industry leader 
•Longer Life: Life cycle 5x greater than your industry leader 
•Can use at subzero temperatures, where as industry leader will shut down near freezing 
•Actual watt hours: Industry leader will shut off well before full battery discharge to avoid damage. 
•No maintenance required:  Must frequently recharge industry leading generator, not required with GRENGINE™ 
 
Why GRENGINE™ 1000 vs. Small Gas Generator? 
•More user friendly – no fuel needed, easy to carry and simple operation 
•No maintenance required 
•Completely safe to use and can be used inside – no harmful emissions. 
•Reduced frequency of theft due to inside use and storage 
•Run anywhere at anytime of day or night 
•Versatile! When not used for camping it is easily used for home backup, or construction, or recreation…… 
 
Waaaaait a minute...
Did you notice a John Deere Gator in the video? Did we run that Gator with our Grengine™ batteries? Yup, we did. 
Each Grengine™ battery (which weighs only 12lbs) is the power equivalent of a 12V 100 Amp hour lead acid battery (which typically weighs 85lbs). Which means with the appropriate adaptor, the Grengine™ batteries can be used to power almost anything currently operating on lead acid.

Tantra (/ˈtʌntrə, ˈtæn-/; Sanskrit: ""text, theory, system, method, instrument, technique or practice""
Researching best practices in agriculture, “Krishitantra” addresses difficulties in the current system of farming with indigenously designed instruments and tools to improve farming outcomes.
If you own a hydroponics or aquaponics farm, then you know its pros and cons. It's very easy to grow using these techniques provided the required fundamentals of water is taken care of, the crucial ones being EC and pH.
EC and pH have to be regularly monitored and has to be controlled on a real-time basis.
DOSEiON, a solution designed for the modern farmer comes with sensors that monitor and regulate the EC, pH, and temperature for the crop.  It can't get easier than this, you can use the DOSEiON app from both your android and iOS devices. 
 





 
LED indicates when the sensor values are in normal range, out of range, setting mode and dosing status.

Any Bike - Most electric bikes look fairly weird, perhaps not your style. UrbaNext let's you convert any bike to fit your taste or riding style. 

Affordability - Most electric bikes are expensive. Don't pay for something you already own and love, upgrade your existing bike at a fraction of the cost. 

Weight - Most electric bikes weigh anywhere from 65 to 90 pounds. UrbaNext is designed to be light weight, only adding an additional 15 pounds to your bike. 

Plug & Play - Most electric bikes are hard to pedal. UrbaNext is designed for the front wheel, not affecting your pedals and easily taken off in seconds if preferred.

Converting your traditional bike into an e-bike is hassle-free.UrbaNext works great on road bikes, mountain bikes, bmx bikes, beach cruisers, etc..Install UrbaNext in under a minute, swap out batteries in one simple click and squeeze the throttle to go electric or stay traditional and pedal as normal.The UrbaNext Electric Wheel requires only a wrench, a screwdriver & one minute until you're pressing the throttle on your new electric bicycle.UrbaNext will fit 99% of bicycles on the market and is installed in 3 simple steps:

Step 1: Swap Out Front Wheel 

Step 2: Secure Throttle To Handlebar

Step 3: Connect Wheel To Throttle Cable
  UrbaNext's one-click removable battery is compact, allowing you to charge your new eBike when and where it's convenient for you. Easily double your range in seconds by tossing an extra fresh battery in your backpack or bike saddle bag then swap the new for the old in a single click.  The choice of riding traditionally, all electric or somewhere in between is up to you. Unlike most eBikes that are hard to pedal and designed for electric only riding, UrbaNext allows you to comfortably pedal as you normally would or easily switch between electric modes: 

Full-Electric Mode - Sit back, relax and press the throttle down on your new eBike and allow the UrbaNext Electric Wheel do all of the work. 

Pedal Assist Mode - Your bike will now sense you pedaling and how fast, activating the any of UrbaNext's 3 levels of assist you've selected. 

Traditional Bike Mode - With our front wheel motor your traditional bike it pedals as it normally would, not affecting your chains, gears or pedals like most eBikes.
Better yet, you can restore your bike to it's traditional, non-electric state in seconds by simply swapping back to your original bike wheel.  UrbaNext is the first and only electric bike wheel with 7 sizes, fitting almost every bicycle.UrbaNext is available in 7 sizes; 20"", 24”, 26”, 27.5”, 29"", 650c & 700c that covers 99% of the global bike market.Unlike most other add-on electric options, UrbaNext also works with both rim and disc brakes and any tire you choose that fits the rim size. No matter if you prefer a beach cruiser, bmx, mountain bike, etc...there's likely an UrbaNext for your bike.The only decision you'll need to make is: What version of UrbaNext do you prefer and how many batteries would you like?In advance of our June 2017 shipping date (just in time for summer!), we'll send a survey asking for your bike’s brake type and wheel size, ensuring you'll get the right size...it's that easy.  Power meets performance in a compact package with an UrbaNext eBike Wheel. With 350w of power, UrbaNext can tackle the toughest terrain. UrbaNext comes in two sizes, a 350W electric motor and a 240W electric motor allowing it to be street legal in nearly every state and/or country.  With an UrbaNext electric bike wheel, your choices are easy and boil down to your location and how fast you want to go... Powerful 350W Electric Motor - USA Street LegalUrbaNext's most powerful 350W motor has a top speed of 20mph with a max range of 30 miles and is street legal in the United States.Standard 240W Electric Motor - USA/EU Street LegalOur 240W motor has a top speed of 15mph with a max range of 30 miles and is street legal in the UK, EU, USA, etc. Benefits of the UrbaNext Plug & Play Front Drive Motor:

Pedaling - With a font drive motor, it is much easier to pedal while riding your bike traditionally, as it does not interfere with the drive train. 

Safer - By mounting the motor on the front wheel of your bike, you eliminate accidental wheelies by pressing the throttle too hard. 

Weight - Aviation aluminum maintains lightweight, only adding about 7kg (15lbs) including the motor, battery, spoke, rim and tire.
  UrbaNext is the first ever electric eBike wheel with a 3 level pedal assist system and is easily changed via our mobile app. Sometimes you can use a little bit of assistance on that long ride...UrbaNext is here to help.With pedal assist mode, UrbaNext senses your pedaling, and the motor kicks in to help you along based on how fast you pedal and your selection of the 3 levels of pedal assistance in the UrbaNext app. Pedal Assist System (PAS) controlled by iOS or Android Smartphone App.The more you choose to pedal and the lower the level of assistance selected, the more range you can expect and you can always take a spare battery with you for longer rides.    The secret to UrbaNext's small size is that it works smarter, not harder by using an algorithm to ensure 100% of motor output is utilized to power your ride.With the UrbaNext eBike battery and motor working smarter, we can minimize size and increase range.By using our patent-pending Sinus Algorithm Controlling System to convert electric energy that's stored in the battery to kinetic energy from the motion of your wheel, UrbaNext is able to minimize energy loss, increase output and ultimately extend the riding range of your battery.  Additionally, the 36V, 3500mAh & 126Wh lithium ion battery pack is rated at 125Wh and meets the International Aviation Transportation Association requirements allowing it onboard flights should you travel.  The fully-electric bike thumb throttle makes it easy to cruise along at up to 20 MPH with the push of a button and no pedaling required.  The handlebar thumb throttle is optional and the only part connecting to your bicycle. If you choose to only want a pedal assist only bicycle and not full electric, you have the option to not instal the throttle.     UrbaNext is intelligently designed so not to affect your bicycles performance by adding a tremendous amount of extra weight.You'll hardly even notice its there...but you'll be glad it is.By using aircraft grade aluminum we can achieve maximum strength and durability while making it the lightest weight eBike option with a total weight of 15lbs which include: motor, battery, spokes, rim & tire.              Top Speed: 15mph (25kmh) for UrbaNext Eco, 20mph (33kmh) for UrbaNext Booster  Motor Power: 240W for UrbaNext Eco, 350W for UrbaNext Booster  Speed Levels: 3 levels  Battery: Lithium Ion Battery (Manufacturer TBD - Panasonic or Sanyo or LG) – 36V, 3500mAH, 126WH  Charge Time: ~1.5Hrs  Battery Life: 1000 Cycles  Range: Up to 30miles (50km)  Supportable Brake Types: Both Rim Brake and Disc Brake  Supportable Rim SIze: 20/24/26/27.5/29"" & 650/700c  Dropout Size: International Standard 100mm  Weight: 15lbs (7kg) Max Load: 300lbs (135kg)  Material: Aviation Aluminium  Connectivity: Bluetooth Low Energy (4.0)  App OS: iOS/Android  Warranty: 1 Year Limited   Early sketches of the UrbaNext  Our founder Eric has 7 years of experience in the traditional Electric Bike Trading and has served customers from all around the world.

You may have seen some news out of the U.S. from Honda Motor Company about a new option available on the <a href=""http://www.autoblog.com/2013/08/29/new-odyssey-ads-feature-honda-vac-star-power-video/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2014 Odyssey Van </a>- the world's first built-in cabin vacuum cleaner system! I am the designer of the electronics and motor controls for this product. However, I have always had the eye and the heart of an inventor, and have questioned the established conventions in my field of design. I do not accept the conventional notion that wasted energy has to be a factor in every electrical machine, and so have developed the concept for the home Quantum Energy Generator (QEG) to disprove this theory (also shown by others in the video).</li></ul>

<p>I have recently resigned from the position I've held for 26 years with an  internationally known motor manufacturer because I am confident in my ability to bring this technology to people and communities that need it. I am not in this for financial gain. Rather, it has become clear to me that this is my purpose on Earth at this time. <em>James M. Robitaille</em></p>

<h2> About the Invention</h2>
<ul><li>The words 'quantum field' sound mysterious, but this is just another way to say 'smaller than atoms.' The energy source for the QEG is the same<br/>force which holds atoms together. In conventional electric current flow, the<br/>movement of electrons is what provides usable energy. With our machine, we also use conventional electron flow, but in addition, we are making use of the many other smaller particles which have been known by some energy pioneers since the early 1900’s - people like Tesla, Moray, Schauberger, Riech and others.</li></ul>

<ul><li><p>In basic terms, our machine reverses the conventions used to build electric motors, i.e., instead of using low voltage/high current construction, which wastes energy, our designs use high voltage/low current construction, which gives us a HUGE surplus of energy.

<p><strong>-</strong> The machines get their input from the quantum field, which is estimated to have in the neighborhood of 200 Megawatts of power available in every cubic foot of space.

<p><strong>-</strong>  Convenient and clean!

<h2>Benefits to humanity</h2>
<p>The potential for these systems to alleviate some of the desperation and human suffering in poor countries is immense!

Electric light (and even satellite internet access) can be provided where people live in darkness and isolation due to lack of access to any source of power, and lack of any means to pay, even if power were available.

About the Inventor
I am a career Electronics Engineer, who has been designing electronic controls for electric motors for 26+ years. I hold 9 patents and am knowledgeable in many different types of electric motor design. My father was a mechanical designer, so I have been immersed in the field of electro-mechanical motion from my youth. A large part of my work has been in designing rugged, efficient and manufacturable motors and electronic controls for consumer and industrial products. You may have seen some news out of the U.S. from Honda Motor Company about a new option available on the 2014 Odyssey Van - the world's first built-in cabin vacuum cleaner system! I am the designer of the electronics and motor controls for this product. However, I have always had the eye and the heart of an inventor, and have questioned the established conventions in my field of design. I do not accept the conventional notion that wasted energy has to be a factor in every electrical machine, and so have developed the concept for the home Quantum Energy Generator (QEG) to disprove this theory (also shown by others in the video).

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This biosensor will consist of two parts: <br/>1. A sensory Nickel Iron class hydrogenase taken from Magnetospirillum magneticum. This will sense H2 and produce cyclic-di-GMP phosphodiesterase. <br/>2. A Cyclic-di-GMP riboswitch which controls the transcription of a fluorophore (eGFP) as the reporter. <br/><br/>During transcription cyclic-di-GMP binds to riboswitch, creating a terminator loop that stops eGFP from being transcribed. In the presence of H2 the NiFe 2c hydrogenase produces cyclic-di-GMP phosphodiesterase, removing the terminator loop from the riboswitch allowing transcription and subsequent translation of eGFP. The riboswitch terminator only forms when cyclic-di-GMP is bound to its aptamer so when combined with the sensory system, hydrogen gas will be detectable and measurable. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impacts of hydrogen biosensors will be diverse and plentiful. These could potentially include: </p>
<p>-Use in alternative fuels and as a result aid in the fight against climate change</p>
<p>-Use in laboratory and other workplace scenarios as an alternative detection method for hydrogen leaks, which is a huge safety concern</p>

<p>Rayton Solar has developed a solar panel manufacturing technology that produces solar energy cheaper than fossil fuels right here in the USA. If our

<p><b>How We Do it</b></p>
<p>We have a patent pending solar panel manufacturing
technology that utilizes 50x-100x less silicon (the most expensive component of
a solar panel) than traditional manufacturing techniques; while increasing our panels’

cheaper than any current company in the world. Right now the cheapest panels are made in China, but with our technology we can beat them in price. </p>

Sleek, smart but most importantly affordable to run. Designed to simply plug and play, with no installation costs. SOLUS+ is designed to be more cost efficient than conventional electric radiators and smarter than your current home heater. You can now control your heating from the comfort of your phone. Cost efficiency that benefits the environment and your wallet.SAVE ON YOUR HEATING BILLSOur unique graphene-based heating technology works by emitting far infrared heat. Infrared technology heats in the same way as the sun. Rather than heating the air around you like traditional heaters, it heats you and the objects in the room directly.  By not relying on convection heat, a 800W SOLUS+ M2 unit can heat a 20sqm space with up to 30% less energy than traditional electric radiators. Read more about infrared heating technology hereThe average UK home* spends approximately £655/€745/$845** on their heating each year. By backing SOLUS+ on Indiegogo, you can transform the way you heat your home. By changing to SOLUS+ infrared heating system, not only will you gain a smarter heating system and transparency on your heating costs, you could also reduce your annual heating bills by up to £196/€223/$253 per year (based on average UK home*), leaving you to enjoy the additional savings each year to spend on things that matter to you the most.*https://www.labc.co.uk/news/what-average-house-size-uk?language_content_entity=en** https://www.providentpersonalcredit.com/is-winter-coming/  THE BENEFITS OF THE SOLUS+ SYSTEMUnlike other heating options, SOLUS+ is a plug and play solution.

<p style=""color:#f7e6dd;"">Going below ground means we're feeding the plants at the root level, where they draw in their nutrients.<br/><br/>Using nothing but worms and microbes, this natural process aerates the soil and adds good bacteria throughout your garden. The unique series of holes beneath the soil allow worms and microbes to freely move to and from the system and the surrounding garden bed.<br/><br/>And the best part is, your herbs and vegetables are being fed in a really natural way, every day - reducing the need for other fertilisers.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Install</p>
<p>Embed the Subpod system into the soil of your veggie garden, with the top vents above ground. Ideally within a raised garden bed so that the top can be used as a seat.</p>
</div>
<div style=""width:49%;display:inline-block;padding:0 30px 30px 0;vertical-align:top;"">

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Fill</p>
<p>Fill the Subpod with healthy worms and castings and starter materials. Leave worms for 6 days to settle in.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Feed &amp; Mix</p>
<p>Feed the Subpod twice a week with food scraps and carbon matter (i.e. leaves, shredded newspaper, dry mulch). Mix the contents with the aerator tool.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Spread</p>
<p>Once the Subpod has filled up, leave it for 10 days to be processed. Then it's time to take out some of the rich compost soil and spread it across your surrounding gardens.</p>

<h4 style=""margin:0 0 15px 0;"">Performance Composting</h4>
<p>We've designed an internal divider which slides in to create sections with the Subpod. This allows you to compost your waste more effectively, allowing one side to be filled with new food waste, whilst the other could be harvested, essentially worm-free. The worms will move to where the food is, or away from something that needs to de-gas, such as onions. It would also suit composting a smaller amount of food waste more efficiently, which would be suitable for an individual, a couple, or those producing less waste.</p>

<h2 style=""font-size:30px;margin:0 0 15px 0;font-weight:300;"">What Can I Compost?</h2>
<p>Organic waste includes much more than just food scraps. Subpod will allow you to compost any organic matter which would usually be discarded in a green bin, including lawn and garden waste, paper, and even natural fibres such as clothing. That means that favourite old cotton shirt doesn’t have to go to landfill when you wear it out!</p>

Join the compost underground! Composting is a good news story that you can be a part of every day.

Divert waste from landfill
Help cool the climate by avoiding methane emissions, a greenhouse gas more than to 18 times more powerful than CO2

Turn food waste into soil food to grow food
Stay connected to the natural systems that sustain life

We’ve taken the mess, smell and hard work out of composting!

 

The efficient, low-maintenance and odour-free composting system powered by worms and microbes.
Composting your food waste has never been this simple
Composting made easy
The Subpod® in-garden compost system that works with nature, using worms and microbes to compost organic waste without the odours, vermin, mess and hard work of traditional composting.

Repair soil, grow food
The Subpod® not only disposes of your organic waste, but is also the ‘growth hub’ for your garden. The movement of worms and microbes between your Subpod® and garden bed builds soil fertility and plant health, allowing you to grow nutrient-dense food at home with ease.

Take a seat
Subpod doubles as a sturdy bench seat. So, once you've fed the worms, have a seat in your garden, and reconnect with your herbs and veggies.

Go Underground
Stable & Effective Composting
Going below ground means we're feeding the plants at the root level, where they draw in their nutrients.Using nothing but worms and microbes, this natural process aerates the soil and adds good bacteria throughout your garden. The unique series of holes beneath the soil allow worms and microbes to freely move to and from the system and the surrounding garden bed.And the best part is, your herbs and vegetables are being fed in a really natural way, every day - reducing the need for other fertilisers.
  
 

How It Works
Simple Install. Simple Maintenance.



 
Step 1: Install
Embed the Subpod system into the soil of your veggie garden, with the top vents above ground. Ideally within a raised garden bed so that the top can be used as a seat.


 
Step 2: Fill
Fill the Subpod with healthy worms and castings and starter materials. Leave worms for 6 days to settle in.


 
Step 3: Feed & Mix
Feed the Subpod twice a week with food scraps and carbon matter (i.e. leaves, shredded newspaper, dry mulch). Mix the contents with the aerator tool.


 
Step 4: Spread
Once the Subpod has filled up, leave it for 10 days to be processed. Then it's time to take out some of the rich compost soil and spread it across your surrounding gardens.

20,000 More People Composting By 2020

We have a massive vision to equip and enable 20,000 more people to start composting by the end of this year! That means 10,000 tonnes of food waste is diverted from landfill and 400+ tonnes of fresh food can be produced with that waste! And we're relying on your support to help make our big vision a reality!
We've received pre-orders and wonderful support from over 26 countries throughout this Indiegogo campaign alone, which tells us one thing - the world is eager to make a change to the way we manage our food waste, for the sake of our soil!

Be your own Green Grocer
Convert Waste to Food
You can finally start composting your own waste and growing your own food at your home or workplace with more ease.As Subpod is embedded right in your growing garden, it helps feed and boost your herbs and vegetables on a daily basis. The worms feed and then transverse out through the soil, excreting natural fertilisers and aerating it, all at the plant root level.

Easy Assembly
Flat Packed Design
The intelligent patented design of Subpod® allows for very simple assembly. In less than 3 minutes, and with no tools or technical know-how, you can be all setup ready to install into your garden. We're making composting easier and more accommodating!

Performance Composting
We've designed an internal divider which slides in to create sections with the Subpod. This allows you to compost your waste more effectively, allowing one side to be filled with new food waste, whilst the other could be harvested, essentially worm-free. The worms will move to where the food is, or away from something that needs to de-gas, such as onions. It would also suit composting a smaller amount of food waste more efficiently, which would be suitable for an individual, a couple, or those producing less waste.

Intelligent Design
Considerate design for effective composting
We're spent many years developing the Subpod design. This system, although quite simple in appearance, has been meticulously tested and continually improved to work as optimally as possible, whilst being affordable and aesthetically pleasing.You can lock the Subpod if it's in a community garden or shared space, and you can collect the worm tea via a built in drain pipe (BYO hose), which has an internal filter and can be plumbed around your garden.


""When we feed the soil we bring the food vitality and nutrient density right up to the maximum. It's the soil ecosystem we’re stimulating. And the Subpod incubates that into action. It starts that catalyst of event right there in your garden. From your waste stream on your kitchen bench, straight to the garden, back to the food - where you are. You can’t do it more efficiently!""
Geoff Lawton
CEO of Permaculture Research InstituteWorld renowned Permaculture consultant, designer and teacher


“Nowadays, Sri Lankans are going for organic farming, organic cultivation and organic food. We are fed up with chemical fertilisers. Our soils are degraded and we have to nourish them again. This could be a very good idea for our future generations and the Sri Lankan community”
S. Rajika Amarasinghe, Ph.D.
Department of Soil Science,Faculty of Agriculture,University of Ruhuna, Sri Lanka



""Subpod is the perfect onsite waste management strategy for restaurants, schools, offices, homes and gardens. I can't wait to get one into my new home currently under construction.""
Martin Anda PhDBSc (Hons), BE (Mech), MIEAust
Academic Chair of Environmental Engineering School of Engineering & Information Technology, Murdoch University


“Subpods would be ideal for small remote island communities. Communities that live in a village lifestyle and can deal with organic waste internally. This is the way islands can sustain themselves and not rely on imported fertilizers.”
Denise Quintal
Executive Director,EcoNorfolk FoundationAdjunct Associate Lecturer,University of Sydney


What Can I Compost?
Organic waste includes much more than just food scraps. Subpod will allow you to compost any organic matter which would usually be discarded in a green bin, including lawn and garden waste, paper, and even natural fibres such as clothing. That means that favourite old cotton shirt doesn’t have to go to landfill when you wear it out!
Even food scraps that are traditionally excluded from other compost systems can be added, including citrus peel, onions, fish, and meat on the bone (in small quantities). Just remember, it is worms and microbes doing the work, so the smaller each piece of waste is, the faster they will break it down.

<p><i>We’ve taken a standard business in Africa, phone charging, and made it profitable, healthy and educational with the power of solar. </i><i>SolarFi</i><i> is positioned to lift a generation out of poverty.</i></p>
<p>We immersed ourselves in Africa and spent two years doing market research to solve pressing problems such as poverty reduction, education, capacity building, technical skills, ENERGY, AND INTERNET. We met with Dr. Kandeh Yumkella, former CEO of UN-Energy, whose job was to reduce poverty through clean energy who educated us on his lessons. </p>
<p>We brought this idea to VVM (Valley Venture Mentors), one of the top startup accelerators/incubators in America. We finished 4th out of 36 companies in a competitive program in Massachusetts. Even in 2018, over one billion people globally lack access to electricity. In Africa alone, 600 million people have no power. This lack of energy has been a barrier to social and economic development. We were awarded $12,500.</p>

We’ve taken a standard business in Africa, phone charging, and made it profitable, healthy and educational with the power of solar. SolarFi is positioned to lift a generation out of poverty.
We immersed ourselves in Africa and spent two years doing market research to solve pressing problems such as poverty reduction, education, capacity building, technical skills, ENERGY, AND INTERNET. We met with Dr. Kandeh Yumkella, former CEO of UN-Energy, whose job was to reduce poverty through clean energy who educated us on his lessons. 
We brought this idea to VVM (Valley Venture Mentors), one of the top startup accelerators/incubators in America. We finished 4th out of 36 companies in a competitive program in Massachusetts. Even in 2018, over one billion people globally lack access to electricity. In Africa alone, 600 million people have no power. This lack of energy has been a barrier to social and economic development. We were awarded $12,500.

 SolarFi will connect people to solar power and WiFi. Educational programs can be accessed on the SolarFi platform. People spend up to two hours every day just to charge their phone. SolarFi can solve this issue.   It is a basic human need to be connected. 

Jerry Shaye was educated at Columbia business school and Dartmouth college. He started his career in the peace corps. I returned to New York where I worked as the Director of International Trade for NY state. I teamed up with Antonio Dixon, who founded SunPowerd, a solar energy company selling solar lanterns and solar generators in Africa, however, most people didn't want just light, they wanted to be able to charge their phones, and around their friends. 

 

We put together an all-star team. The SolarFi team comes from Columbia University, Dartmouth, Oxford, and Princeton and is led by Jerry Shaye, former Director of International Trade Development at the New York State Department of Economic Development, Antonio Dixon, founder of SunPowerd, Dr. Ekwow Spio-Garbrah former Ambassador of Ghana to the USA, Inventor Glenn Butler, and Isha Varshney former manager at KPMG.
SolarFi allows us to educate people, empower people to run their own micro-franchise model. Most people don't know how to run a business, but franchises have a higher chance of success.  
For every $10,000 (every charging station) we can educate 20,000 people, reduce carbon emission exposure, empower four entrepreneurs, social, and environmental benefits.

We were just selected as a top 100 startup change-maker by Harvard, and MIT's hubweek

<h1>These are Pale Blue: The world's best USB rechargeable lithium polymer AA and AAA batteries.</h1>
<div data-id=""25968409""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/025/968/409/3747b4b75961114a9aa4dd3b34f4e80c_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1564455777&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=3ab6074cef5db84aa911b04ee8851343"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p><strong>Save money and sustain a better world.</strong> In America alone, 10 million batteries are thrown away every day. One pack of Pale Blue USB rechargeable LiPo batteries can replace up to 4,000 alkalines. Making the switch can save you $$$$ and keep toxic disposable batteries out of landfills. <strong>Ditch disposables!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Less waste </strong>- One Pale Blue battery can prevent the existence and disposal of 1000 alkalines over its lifetime.</li>
<li>
<strong>Superior Performance </strong>- Better voltage stability, current output, stability, than alkalines and old school NiMh rechargeables.</li>
<li>
<strong>Ultra Fast Charging </strong>- Charges in one fifth the time of a NiMh rechargeable.</li>
<li>
<strong>Unmatched Convenience </strong>- On-board micro-USB charging port (4 end charging cable provided so you can charge 4 batteries at once).</li>
<li>
<strong>Huge Savings Potential </strong>- Recharging Pale Blue batteries means not buying disposables and this means savings for you!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>That's enough to go around the planet 4 1/2 times every year.</strong> That's a 70 pound bucket every 12 seconds!</p>
<p>We're starting by bringing lithium polymer technology to AA and AAA batteries. It's the same type of battery that powers your cell phone allowing Pale Blue to charge faster and last longer. It's so fast it will charge a AA in under 2 hours and a AAA in under 1 hour. Better yet, a single Pale Blue rechargeable will replace 1000+ alkaline disposables.</p>
<p>Let's build a better world by putting an end to tossing disposable batteries into landfills.</p>
<h1>More convenience. Micro USB port means no separate charger so you can power your life anywhere.</h1>
<p>Simply plug your Pale Blue in with any micro USB cable or use our included cable to charge four batteries at once. The LED charge indicator will turn green when you are good to go. Power up quickly when you are on the go, at work, home or traveling. Charging times are surprisingly fast.</p>

These are Pale Blue: The world's best USB rechargeable lithium polymer AA and AAA batteries.

Save money and sustain a better world. In America alone, 10 million batteries are thrown away every day. One pack of Pale Blue USB rechargeable LiPo batteries can replace up to 4,000 alkalines. Making the switch can save you $$$$ and keep toxic disposable batteries out of landfills. Ditch disposables!


Less waste - One Pale Blue battery can prevent the existence and disposal of 1000 alkalines over its lifetime.

Superior Performance - Better voltage stability, current output, stability, than alkalines and old school NiMh rechargeables.

Ultra Fast Charging - Charges in one fifth the time of a NiMh rechargeable.

Unmatched Convenience - On-board micro-USB charging port (4 end charging cable provided so you can charge 4 batteries at once).

Huge Savings Potential - Recharging Pale Blue batteries means not buying disposables and this means savings for you!


 
10 million battery cells thrown away every day? That really starts to add up. . .

That's enough to go around the planet 4 1/2 times every year. That's a 70 pound bucket every 12 seconds!
We're starting by bringing lithium polymer technology to AA and AAA batteries. It's the same type of battery that powers your cell phone allowing Pale Blue to charge faster and last longer. It's so fast it will charge a AA in under 2 hours and a AAA in under 1 hour. Better yet, a single Pale Blue rechargeable will replace 1000+ alkaline disposables.
Let's build a better world by putting an end to tossing disposable batteries into landfills.
More convenience. Micro USB port means no separate charger so you can power your life anywhere.
Simply plug your Pale Blue in with any micro USB cable or use our included cable to charge four batteries at once. The LED charge indicator will turn green when you are good to go. Power up quickly when you are on the go, at work, home or traveling. Charging times are surprisingly fast.

That way you're always charged to power the devices and toys you love.

Save money. Don't throw away cash with disposable batteries.
If you're spending $1 per single-use, disposable battery then one of our batteries can save you $1,000 over its lifetime.


 
How is it better than rechargeable batteries I've used before?
With LiPo technology, Pale Blue charges 5x faster than conventional rechargeable batteries.

LiPo provides higher power and more consistent output through its use cycle.

Pale Blue Smart Batteries will last 2x as many charges as NiMh.

<p><strong>So far, we have used this equipment to make simple products, </strong>like flower pots and keychains. These are a good start, and we hope you like them, <strong>but we also know that plastic waste has great potential</strong>. If we can get to the next level of equipment, we can produce important, useful things for the world, and divert thousands of tons of plastic waste from the waste stream. With a new extrusion machine ($6,000), <strong>we can create beams and boards that we can use to produce furniture, playground equipment, building materials, and much more. </strong>We also need to acquire a small pickup truck ($2,000) in order to move larger amounts of plastic from our partner organizations to our workshop, and some more steel parts ($1,000) for an industrial plastic washing machine. <strong>All this will cost us about $9,000.</strong></p>
<p>These upgrades alone would allow us <strong>to recycle, process, and remanufacture thousands of tons of additional plastic every year.</strong> We're improving upon traditional waste-to-resource methods to make them more efficient and scalable. The process is not easy, but it's simple and uses relatively old technology.</p>
<div>We can turn plastic waste into useful, long-lasting products that regular people actually need. Right now, we're making small objects, <strong>but we're building an even bigger workshop to achieve those bigger goals.</strong>
</div>
<p> </p>
<h2>We plan to</h2>
<p>- collect<strong> tons</strong> of plastic waste from local factories, businesses, and municipal waste management facilities.</p>
<p>- produce useful products such as <strong>construction materials and furniture</strong>, for businesses and retail sales.</p>
<p>- collaborate with local Phoenix artists to make powerful pieces of art out of recycled plastic to be displayed at colleges, art galleries and festivals with all contributors credited.</p>
<p>- collaborate with local high schools and colleges to offer coursework in sustainable plastics manufacturing.</p>

<p>Until we present an alternative, <strong>plastic waste will keep going to incinerators and landfills.</strong> Here are the major reasons why we need an alternative:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Incinerating (and landfilling) waste materials depletes resources, </strong>captures a small amount of energy, and adds pollution to urban and natural environments.</li>
<li>Incinerators always require <strong>large amounts of capital investment, yet they create relatively few jobs</strong> when compared to recycling.</li>
<li>U.S. incinerators are one of the leading contributors to <strong>greenhouse gases such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, volatile organic compounds, and sulfur dioxide</strong> (Source: The Ecology Center - Detroit's Future Without a Trash Incinerator).</li>
<li>When compared to conventional mass incinerators, <strong>staged incinerators such as gasification and pyrolysis emit similar levels of toxins </strong>(Source: The European Commission's Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Reference Document on the Best Available Technologies for Waste Incineration).</li>
<li>
<strong>Recycling and composting are more economically sensible</strong> than incineration and landfilling.</li>
<li>Studies have found that <strong>communities near incinerators experience the following negative health effects:</strong><ol>
<li>
<strong>Increase in</strong> <strong>pre-term babies and babies born with spina bifida or heart defects.</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Increased cancers,</strong> especially larynx, lung, colorectal, liver and stomach cancers, leukemia, and others.</li>

<p>Here are the major reasons <strong>why recycling will be a better solution</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's <i>U.S. Recycling Economic Information Study </i>reports that <strong>recycling industries already provide 1.1 million jobs</strong> in the U.S., an amount similar to that of the U.S. auto and machinery manufacturing industries.</li>
<li>According to a 2007 report by the Detroit City Council, a 50 percent recycling rate would result in the <strong>creation of more than 1,000 jobs </strong>in that city alone.</li>
<li>With a recycling rate of only 34 percent, <strong>recycling industries generate an annual payroll of $37 billion and gross over $236 billion in annual revenue </strong>(U.S. Recycling Economic Information Study)</li>
<li>Per ton of materials, <strong>recycling saves more than seven times the carbon emissions </strong>compared to landfilling, and almost 18 times reduction from incineration.</li>
<li>If materials currently burned in incinerators were recycled, they would <strong>save 3 to 5 times more energy</strong> than incinerators would generate,<strong> because recycling saves on the cost of new material extraction and production.</strong>

The result is a method that makes much more sense for the economy, for the customer, and for our planet. The Old WayFrom resources to waste. People are realizing that the linear model is inherently wasteful. If we transition to a circular model, we can divert waste back into the process, conserves resources, and reduce pollution.We plan to use plastic waste to make large, beautiful, useful things, like furniture and construction materials - and we know how to do it - but first, we need to show the world that we can, and save up for the large machines that we need. So before we start making things like furniture and building materials, we’re starting small, with flower pots and keychains to thank our supporters.History shows that small acts combine to accomplish big things. That means electronic equipment, a larger new workspace, and a few other things that we don’t quite have yet - but we'll get there. The New WayFrom resources to waste, then back into resources.From linear to circular, and from waste to resources. Our project was inspired, in part, by Dave Hakkens' Precious Plastic project. This project was fun, but if we're going to make a big impact on the massive global plastic problem, we need industrial-sized solutions. The PlanWe want to keep plastic waste out of landfills, incinerators, and waterways. We've been thinking for a while about how to locally make an impact on the global plastic problem, and now we need your help. 

 
So far, we have used this equipment to make simple products, like flower pots and keychains. These are a good start, and we hope you like them, but we also know that plastic waste has great potential. If we can get to the next level of equipment, we can produce important, useful things for the world, and divert thousands of tons of plastic waste from the waste stream. With a new extrusion machine ($6,000), we can create beams and boards that we can use to produce furniture, playground equipment, building materials, and much more. We also need to acquire a small pickup truck ($2,000) in order to move larger amounts of plastic from our partner organizations to our workshop, and some more steel parts ($1,000) for an industrial plastic washing machine. All this will cost us about $9,000.
These upgrades alone would allow us to recycle, process, and remanufacture thousands of tons of additional plastic every year. We're improving upon traditional waste-to-resource methods to make them more efficient and scalable. The process is not easy, but it's simple and uses relatively old technology.
We can turn plastic waste into useful, long-lasting products that regular people actually need. Right now, we're making small objects, but we're building an even bigger workshop to achieve those bigger goals.

 
We plan to
- collect tons of plastic waste from local factories, businesses, and municipal waste management facilities.
- produce useful products such as construction materials and furniture, for businesses and retail sales.
- collaborate with local Phoenix artists to make powerful pieces of art out of recycled plastic to be displayed at colleges, art galleries and festivals with all contributors credited.
- collaborate with local high schools and colleges to offer coursework in sustainable plastics manufacturing.

The Pot

Our first production, designed for this project, is inspired by a sense of responsibility to help strengthen others, the economy, and the planet. When you help us grow this project with a contribution of $20 or more, we will help you grow something useful with a little pot that we handmade with 100% locally recycled plastic using home-built equipment. Along with the pot, we'll send some potting soil and your choice of seeds: peppermint, lemon basil, or rosemary.

The Plastic

We divert from local coffee shops, medical schools, and an Arizona goat dairy that otherwise would have to send it to landfills or incinerators. In addition to building these relationships, these crowdfunding products are allowing us to test the market, test our processes, and prove that we indeed can make something beautiful from something that was considered valueless.

 
Why Remanufacturing?
We understand that this project doesn’t make sense to everyone at first glance. It took a lot of research, listening, and learning with experienced industry professionals and academics to figure out how why this is a problem and how we’re going to make an impact.
A Better Alternative Needed
 

Until we present an alternative, plastic waste will keep going to incinerators and landfills. Here are the major reasons why we need an alternative:


Incinerating (and landfilling) waste materials depletes resources, captures a small amount of energy, and adds pollution to urban and natural environments.

Recycling and composting are more economically sensible than incineration and landfilling.
Studies have found that communities near incinerators experience the following negative health effects:

Increase in pre-term babies and babies born with spina bifida or heart defects.


Increased cancers, especially larynx, lung, colorectal, liver and stomach cancers, leukemia, and others.

Increased dioxins in the blood of those who work at incinerators.

<p>3D printing has started a new trend in the technology world, as more and more people enjoy the fun and convenience 3D printing brings to work and leisure time. But most 3D printing filament easily absorbs moisture from the air. And when the moisture content in the filament increases, the print quality decreases, and can even cause prints to fail!</p> <p>In the past three years, SUNLU team has conducted in-depth research efforts to solve this problem. We finally came up with a powerful solution: <strong>Fila Dryer S1</strong>.</p>

3D printing has started a new trend in the technology world, as more and more people enjoy the fun and convenience 3D printing brings to work and leisure time. But most 3D printing filament easily absorbs moisture from the air. And when the moisture content in the filament increases, the print quality decreases, and can even cause prints to fail! In the past three years, SUNLU team has conducted in-depth research efforts to solve this problem. We finally came up with a powerful solution: Fila Dryer S1.

 
 SUNLU Team conducted a print quality comparison, printing the same 3D model with the same filament and printer. The model printed before drying showed poor print quality and rough surface, while the same model printed after drying the filament showed much improved print quality and a smooth surface.

Well-designed 
In order to produce a truly outstanding product, every detail of its design must be carefully considered, and our team has created a device that is both beautiful and practical. The stylish design and the integration of drying and printing of Fila Dryer series make it to be an ideal partner for printing supplies in any workshop or studio.

High Performance
Fila Dryer S1 is perfect for consumers, artists, and designers. It is an integrated solution for drying 3D printing filament and keeping it dry while printing, which can improve print quality and increase the fun of 3D printers.

Work Partner
If you own your own 3D printing studio, the FilaDryer S1 will be your ""personal assistant,"" preserving your investment in filament.
 
 Dustless, neat and remarkable
The appearance of the SUNLU FilaDryer S1 is beautiful from top to bottom. The transparent top lets you see your filament, and prevents dust accumulation.

AND WHAT IS IT FOR?M.E.S., the Mobile Energy System, it’s most efficient way to diffuse energy for mobile devices.Phones, computers, means of transport, appliances, devices of all kinds.All everyday technologies are turning to mobile, but each of them has a common limit: Energy.Waiting stuck for four hours to recharge a laptop, remember to bring along smartphone adapters , chargers, or maybe remember to recharge and carry devices wich power other devices. Thousands of artifices to solve the problem and no solution found.What’s the point of a mobile device without the freedom to use it as such?Here is M.E.S.,Energy made mobile and ubiquitous.Energy everywhere, in any quantity, at any time, for everyone, moving with you and for you, without you doing anything.All the energy you need ready to be taken, brought with you, used and left anywhere you want when you want.

Once the transition is over, the supporter who has sold his subscription will receive the entire sum paid by the new user, and will make money from it. All without the slightest effort. The operation can also be repeated whenever they want, as this exclusive persists for life;5) WHAT IS “REMUNERATION FOR EACH NEW USER INVITED, FOR LIFECODE”?This code allaws users to receive compensation for each new user invited, a percentage of new user subscription fee.

We started this project for our Master's thesis project at TU Delft in the Netherlands, focusing on producing biofuel from pine needles in the Himalayan mountains of northern India, where jobs are scarce, women have few opportunities, and families struggle to stay together. We want to provide income opportunities for locals, especially women, and allow people to stay and build community in the mountains. Join us in impacting lives there!</p><p><strong>What We Need </strong></p><p>We are asking for a total of $17,500 (US), and this will spur us on toward commercialization of our charcoal production enterprise. We have been investing in this project since 2014, and now the biggest hurdle is refining our production process and technology to make the business viable, and to demonstrate our product to the market.</p><p>The first portion of the money raised ($9,500) will go to cover expenses from the Pilot Project we carried out in May of last year, which gave such promising results, but left a lot unfinished. Specifically, the money will go to payback our partner Students4Sustainability who supported us in the project.</p><p>The second portion of the money ($8,000) will fuel our research and development, namely in refining our production process and demonstrating our product to potential customers. We have explored the market substantially already, but now we need to go an show our product and win customers over.</p><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p><p>Imagine with us a life where you have minimal options for income in the place you call home. You have grown up here, your roots are here, your family is here, but it is becoming more and more difficult to pay for basic needs because there simply isn't work to find.</p><p>As the sole bread winner of your family, you are faced with two options: move to the city in search for work, or try to make do in the mountains. The cities are unknown, distant, disconnected from your community, overcrowded, and unsanitary, but might over a meager job. The mountains have  few schools, poor roads and amenities, and dwindling job prospects, but they are home. So what do you do?</p><p>Millions of rural Indians take the leap of faith, and migrate to cities to support their families back at home in underpaying jobs. Those who stay struggle for income and employment opportunities in their hometowns, or families splitting up to survive.  We want to provide economic opportunities in mountain villages, while conserving the environment and preserving the natural beauty.</p><p><strong>Challenges</strong></p><p>As said above, there are hurdles to get past. We need to refine our product and production process to make the business viable. There is promise, but it will take work and your support to get to the point of sustainable charcoal production. Also, we need to work to convince customers that we have a good product. As with anything, proving a new product isn't easy, and we need to go to the customers with our refined product to show them it's value.</p><p>Thankfully, we are in a good spot to handle these obstacles. We are collaborating with pioneers in the field of biofuels, and we are being coached by entrepreneurs who know the region deeply. We already are leveraging our contacts to showcase to some of the most prestigious hotels in India. But we need your help.</p><p><strong>How You Can Be a Part &amp; What you Get</strong></p><p>Join us! Any contribution you can make will push this venture forward. Check out the perks we have put together, to say thanks for being willing to partner with us. We are even featuring some of the finest products from the Kumaon region from some of our awesome partners there. Have a look!</p><p>And if you can't give, we get it.

We started this project for our Master's thesis project at TU Delft in the Netherlands, focusing on producing biofuel from pine needles in the Himalayan mountains of northern India, where jobs are scarce, women have few opportunities, and families struggle to stay together. We want to provide income opportunities for locals, especially women, and allow people to stay and build community in the mountains. Join us in impacting lives there!What We Need We are asking for a total of $17,500 (US), and this will spur us on toward commercialization of our charcoal production enterprise. We have been investing in this project since 2014, and now the biggest hurdle is refining our production process and technology to make the business viable, and to demonstrate our product to the market.The first portion of the money raised ($9,500) will go to cover expenses from the Pilot Project we carried out in May of last year, which gave such promising results, but left a lot unfinished. Specifically, the money will go to payback our partner Students4Sustainability who supported us in the project.The second portion of the money ($8,000) will fuel our research and development, namely in refining our production process and demonstrating our product to potential customers. We have explored the market substantially already, but now we need to go an show our product and win customers over.The ImpactImagine with us a life where you have minimal options for income in the place you call home. You have grown up here, your roots are here, your family is here, but it is becoming more and more difficult to pay for basic needs because there simply isn't work to find.As the sole bread winner of your family, you are faced with two options: move to the city in search for work, or try to make do in the mountains. The cities are unknown, distant, disconnected from your community, overcrowded, and unsanitary, but might over a meager job. The mountains have  few schools, poor roads and amenities, and dwindling job prospects, but they are home. So what do you do?Millions of rural Indians take the leap of faith, and migrate to cities to support their families back at home in underpaying jobs. Those who stay struggle for income and employment opportunities in their hometowns, or families splitting up to survive.  We want to provide economic opportunities in mountain villages, while conserving the environment and preserving the natural beauty.ChallengesAs said above, there are hurdles to get past. We need to refine our product and production process to make the business viable. There is promise, but it will take work and your support to get to the point of sustainable charcoal production. Also, we need to work to convince customers that we have a good product. As with anything, proving a new product isn't easy, and we need to go to the customers with our refined product to show them it's value.Thankfully, we are in a good spot to handle these obstacles. We are collaborating with pioneers in the field of biofuels, and we are being coached by entrepreneurs who know the region deeply. We already are leveraging our contacts to showcase to some of the most prestigious hotels in India. But we need your help.How You Can Be a Part & What you GetJoin us! Any contribution you can make will push this venture forward. Check out the perks we have put together, to say thanks for being willing to partner with us. We are even featuring some of the finest products from the Kumaon region from some of our awesome partners there. Have a look!And if you can't give, we get it. But we still need you to get the word out - pass this on to your friends, family, coworkers, and random strangers! We appreciate your willingness.

<td>The battery management system. It's a ""smart"" system, that allows RIVER to 1) automatically adjust the power output to the Wattage your device needs, 2) regulate temperature so devices don't shut down by starting a fan if too hot, and informing you if it's too cold, and 3) connect individually to each of the 11 output ports so if one were to short circuit or max-out the other 10 would continue charging.</td>

<td>RIVER has one smart DC input port that can automatically adapt to any power source from 10V-22V without an extra adapter. This input is located on the back right-hand side of RIVER. RIVER can be charged via wall charger, car charger, or solar charger. It takes approximately 6 hours to recharge RIVER by AC wall charger, however in only 4 hours, RIVER will be 70% of the way there!</td>

What is RIVER?
RIVER is a portable charging station, back-up generator, and emergency battery. It can be used both indoors and outdoors, and can be recharged via solar charger, car charger or wall charger. (The latter two are included in the purchase of RIVER)


Who created it?
We're EcoFlow Tech, and RIVER is our first product. RIVER was designed entirely in-house by our team.


What are the 11 different ports?
River is equipped with 4 USB ports (2 Quick-Charge 2.0), 2 USB Type-C, 2 DC 6mm outputs, 2 AC outputs, and 1 12V Car Port.


What colors do you offer?
White & Black. 


Which option is best for me?
We recommend selecting the ""RIVER + Case + Solar Charger"" Perk to get RIVER and the 50W Solar Charger, and the Protective Case. This will get you everything you need!


 
 

 Technical

What is the uniqueness of the technology?
The battery management system. It's a ""smart"" system, that allows RIVER to 1) automatically adjust the power output to the Wattage your device needs, 2) regulate temperature so devices don't shut down by starting a fan if too hot, and informing you if it's too cold, and 3) connect individually to each of the 11 output ports so if one were to short circuit or max-out the other 10 would continue charging.


How do I charge my RIVER?
RIVER has one smart DC input port that can automatically adapt to any power source from 10V-22V without an extra adapter. This input is located on the back right-hand side of RIVER. RIVER can be charged via wall charger, car charger, or solar charger. It takes approximately 6 hours to recharge RIVER by AC wall charger, however in only 4 hours, RIVER will be 70% of the way there!


Can RIVER power my devices while it's charging?
Yes, RIVER has state-of-the-art flow-through charging. It can output power while being charged.


How do I store RIVER?
For optimal battery health, store RIVER at room temperature in a dry environment out of direct elements. RIVER will hold its charge for over a year.


What is the battery life?
The battery has a shelf life of 1 year (about 3-4x anything else on the market) this means you can leave in your basement and charge it once a year and it will still keep positive charge.


How does it work?
RIVER is incredibly easy to use. There is an on/off switch in the front, below the screen. To turn RIVER on, press the button for 2 seconds until it beeps. In the back, there is another button to turn on AC power. This is because AC power is quite inefficient, so we regulate its use separately. Hold the button down for 3 seconds in order to turn the AC power on.


How much does it weigh?
11 pounds (5 kilograms)


How many devices can it charge at once?
11 devices


What does auto-sensing mean?
RIVER has an intelligent battery management system. When a device is plugged into RIVER, it will sense the device, automatically turn on, and output the exact wattage your device needs. If RIVER senses nothing is plugged in, it will first turn idle, then turn itself off.

 Safety & Regulation

What is the recommended temperature range?
32-95° F / 0-32° C is optimal for storage. RIVER can operate at up to 140° F / 45° C


Is it waterproof?
While RIVER isn't waterproof, the Protective Case is water resistant up to IP63 standards (rain, dust, sand, etc.). Do not submerge your RIVER under water.


What certifications do you have?
RIVER has FCC, CE, UN38.3, and RoHS certifications. RIVER's chargers also have UL certifications.


How durable is it?
RIVER is very durable and rugged. However, we don't suggest tossing it around, since it's a battery.

 Shipping

When does shipping begin?
The first units will be shipped by June. US & Canada Backers can expect to receive units in July & August. UK, EU, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore will ship by September.


Where does it ship?
We ship to US, Canada, UK, EU, Australia, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Hong Kong. Shipping is free to the US $50 elsewhere.


When is my country's plug version ready?
RIVER will ship with the US-standard 110V AC plugs. Adapters will work just fine. 220-240V 50HZ AC Output Units with Universal Plugs and will be available in September. We'll be evaluating other countries on a case-by-case basis. Send us an email or comment!

 Customer Service

What is the warranty?
For US purchases, EcoFlow warrants RIVER to be free of manufacturing defects. EcoFlow will pay for repair or replacement of parts and labor for 18 months from the date you receive RIVER. Specific terms are shipped with RIVER.

<h3>Some quick numbers:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Of all food purchased by Australians, 20% is thrown away, thats 1 out of every 5 grocery bags simply thrown in the bin.</li>
<li>Every year each Australian household loses over $1000 in food waste, thats enough to pay for half of most households annual electricity bill.</li>
<li>Thats total weight of food thrown out by households each year, making it a total of a whopping 4,000,000 tonnes of food waste Nationally.</li>
<li>Garbage bin analysis of Victorian households found that almost half of all waste discarded by households was perishable food waste.</li>
<li>It takes almost half a million garbage trucks to transport all our food waste, increasing landfill and creating additional costs for our councils.</li>

<p>We made the <strong>EV450 ultra portable</strong> with Li-Polymer battery cells from ATL. Go ahead, look them up. Here's a link to their site: <a href=""https://www.atlbattery.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.atlbattery.com</a> - They're the <strong>4th largest Li-ion</strong> <strong>battery cell manufacturers in the world</strong>; largest supplier for Li-Polymer cells. And <strong>we're the only power station company that they're supplying their Li-Polymer battery cells too</strong>. That says quite a bit about us. It can work from -10°C, below freezing, to 50°C. While being stored, it can withstand -20°C to 60°C. Talk about durability.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Who was the EV450 designed for?</h2>
<p>People who's always on the move, that require power supply constantly. People who are adventurous, always exploring and camping out. People who likes living off the grid for a few days but still requiring the right amount of power for cooking, light entertainment, and staying connected to their devices. People who likes working anywhere.</p>
<h3><strong>People just like you and me, that doesn't want something so heavy to carry around, but not something with so little power either. </strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1548303214/wgz6snhyv6lx9kt3rpqp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We designed the EV450 just to do what it needs to do:</p>
<h3><strong>Supply you with enough power to last for days/weeks at a time and keep it portable for your outdoor adventures. </strong></h3>
<p>No fancy LED screens to bog you down with extra features you don't need. This only adds on weight and more supply cost for you. The only thing we focused on was giving you the best Li-Polymer battery cells to produce the most portable and highest energy capacity power station on the market. This simply means:</p>
<h3><i><strong>You can't find any other power stations on the market <u>LIGHTER</u> than ours, that produces <u>MORE POWER</u> than ours, and <u>COST LESS</u> than ours. Go ahead, try. </strong></i></h3>
<p>We're proud of accomplishing this.</p>
<h3>What if your car battery dies before you get to your destination on your road trip? </h3>

Enough power for 1-2 charges only.  So You look for something stronger - A Portable Power Station. 
But, you feel like you have to be a weightlifter to use those.
 

 
After all, the other brand weighs 16lbs! Producing 400Wh of power.
Have you tried lifting 16lbs? It's not that heavy... until you have to hold onto it for longer than 2 minutes at a time. So, is it still portable? Why would you still get one?
 

 
Maybe because it's still better than those toxic, loud and super heavy electric generators, and that's why they call themselves ""portable"" because they're a bit lighter.
 



 
Don't you deserve the option to use your ""portable"" power stations whenever and wherever you go? To do all the things that it promises while allowing you to just enjoy the moment? Not be such a hassle to load around? Limiting your ability to take it to more places because it's so heavy? We believe that being portable should mean just that, portable - lightweight and easy to carry around, wherever you go.
 

 
So, we present to you our solution of portability

 

Good Things Comes In Two.
 




Which translates to:

But, don't take our words for it. Here's a statement from a photographer in LA who's always shooting outdoors and needed a product like ours to supply him powers - 





You know what we rather be doing instead of that?

You do have friends, right? Just checking.
 
We made the EV450 ultra portable with Li-Polymer battery cells from ATL. Go ahead, look them up. Here's a link to their site: https://www.atlbattery.com - They're the 4th largest Li-ion battery cell manufacturers in the world; largest supplier for Li-Polymer cells. And we're the only power station company that they're supplying their Li-Polymer battery cells too. That says quite a bit about us. It can work from -10°C, below freezing, to 50°C. While being stored, it can withstand -20°C to 60°C. Talk about durability.
 

 
Who was the EV450 designed for?
People who's always on the move, that require power supply constantly. People who are adventurous, always exploring and camping out. People who likes living off the grid for a few days but still requiring the right amount of power for cooking, light entertainment, and staying connected to their devices. People who likes working anywhere.
People just like you and me, that doesn't want something so heavy to carry around, but not something with so little power either. 

We designed the EV450 just to do what it needs to do:
Supply you with enough power to last for days/weeks at a time and keep it portable for your outdoor adventures. 
No fancy LED screens to bog you down with extra features you don't need. This only adds on weight and more supply cost for you. The only thing we focused on was giving you the best Li-Polymer battery cells to produce the most portable and highest energy capacity power station on the market. This simply means:
You can't find any other power stations on the market LIGHTER than ours, that produces MORE POWER than ours, and COST LESS than ours. Go ahead, try. 
We're proud of accomplishing this.
What if your car battery dies before you get to your destination on your road trip? 


 
But, what if you want something a bit lighter and don't need as much power, but still enough for remote work or day-trips? We have a solution for you as well.
 


The EV200 Portable Power Station gives me 2-3 charges on my laptop and my phone at the same time for me to work remotely.
Having the Type-C port also comes in handy as that's the future we're headed towards... right? Here are some of the things it powers.
 



 

 

 

Our EV200 is made from LG Chem, the 2nd largest Li-ion battery manufacturers in the world! Here's a link to their site - http://www.lgchem.com/global/main - working conditions ranges from -10°C, below freezing, to 50°C. While being stored, it can withstand -20°C to 60°C.

<p>The wind, by nature, is unpredictable. It can change in a
blink of an eye, having the potential to be both inconvenient and destructive. </p>
<p>Think about it. Why are we unable to track the sources of
air pollution? Why do you sit on the tarmac for long periods of time or even
experience rough landings when flying? Why do wind farmers struggle to
consistently produce energy? Why does the direction of forest fires change
unpredictably? To put it simply, it’s because of the wind. However, all of these
things could be avoided if we could “see” the wind.</p>

</p><p>Over the last three years we have been working with NASA to
develop a long-range Laser sensor, Windimager™, that can not only “see” the
wind but can measure wind speed and direction out to 16 km (10 miles).
Windimager™, or Windy, solves the problems of Wind Energy inefficiency by
continuously measuring the winds and providing both long-term and instant
information to operators, enabling them to select reliable wind farm sites, optimize
turbine placement and pointing, and warn of a dangerous gust when it is still
20 minutes away. That kind of forewarning gives operators time to fold the
turbine blades, preventing damage.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Windy has a full hemispherical scanner, meaning she can look
at any point that can be seen from horizon to horizon. That allows her to scan
the largest wind farms every two minutes. She can easily be moved around in the
back of a pickup truck, she runs off of a small propane generator, and she can
be up and running in just a few minutes.</p>

<p>
With the help of Windy’s technology, we can
control the otherwise uncontrollable effects of wind. “Seeing” the wind can
give us a handle on its next moves so that we can prepare for what is coming
next. Below are some of the major benefits that Windy gives to being able to
“see” the wind.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/750368/files/20140728173248-talents2.jpg?1406593968"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>

The Problem


The wind, by nature, is unpredictable. It can change in a
blink of an eye, having the potential to be both inconvenient and destructive. 
Think about it. Why are we unable to track the sources of
air pollution? Why do you sit on the tarmac for long periods of time or even
experience rough landings when flying? Why do wind farmers struggle to
consistently produce energy? Why does the direction of forest fires change
unpredictably? To put it simply, it’s because of the wind. However, all of these
things could be avoided if we could “see” the wind.


Meet the Solution: Windy 


Over the last three years we have been working with NASA to
develop a long-range Laser sensor, Windimager™, that can not only “see” the
wind but can measure wind speed and direction out to 16 km (10 miles).
Windimager™, or Windy, solves the problems of Wind Energy inefficiency by
continuously measuring the winds and providing both long-term and instant
information to operators, enabling them to select reliable wind farm sites, optimize
turbine placement and pointing, and warn of a dangerous gust when it is still
20 minutes away. That kind of forewarning gives operators time to fold the
turbine blades, preventing damage.


Windy has a full hemispherical scanner, meaning she can look
at any point that can be seen from horizon to horizon. That allows her to scan
the largest wind farms every two minutes. She can easily be moved around in the
back of a pickup truck, she runs off of a small propane generator, and she can
be up and running in just a few minutes.

Why We Need Her

With the help of Windy’s technology, we can
control the otherwise uncontrollable effects of wind. “Seeing” the wind can
give us a handle on its next moves so that we can prepare for what is coming
next. Below are some of the major benefits that Windy gives to being able to
“see” the wind.
*For more information on what Windy can do, visit our
website at www.windimager.com.
How She Works

Similar to how a radar gun can measure speed by
emitting radar waves reflected between a car and the gun, Windy can measure
wind speed. Laser light reflects off of small, invisible particles that are
suspended in and move with the air. Windy detects the reflected Laser light off
of these particles. Since these small particles move with the wind, the sensor
calculates wind speed and direction.This type of Laser Sensor is called Lidar
(Light Detection and Ranging).
Why She Needs You

It’s been an exciting three years in which we’ve successfully
created a way to measure and predict wind speed and direction. The down side
is: NASA now owns the first WindImager. 
                                    

Now that we have the attention of NASA, major
airports and Wind Farm owners around the world they’d love for us to
demonstrate our system. The problem is, we now have no system. With your help
we can build a second Windy and get her to wind farms, airports, into the hands
of firefighters, meteorologists, and scientists.

Das Internet macht mit seinen Plattformen eine interaktive Kommunikation zwischen Geber und Nehmer möglich.Warum Crowdfunding für NPC?NPC ist jetzt in eine Phase eingetreten, in der sie für Crowdfunder attraktiv wird. Weil das Projekt nach einer mehrjährigen Pilotphase der Forschung und Entwicklung kurz davor ist, das Ziel zu verwirklichen, welches sich die Initiatoren im Jahre 2009 auf die Fahnen geschrieben haben: einen sichtbaren Beitrag zur Wiederverwertung von Plastikmüll zu leisten. Ökologie und Ökonomie ziehen hier am selben Strang: Nur in dem Maße, in dem NPC ökonomisch erfolgreich in den weltweiten Vertrieb ihrer Technologie und Produktionsanlagen geht, wird es ihr gelingen, einen ökologisch wertvollen Beitrag zur Verringerung des Plastikmülls zu leisten. Die Crowdfunder von NPC werden doppelt profitieren: Ökonomisch, indem sie sich bei Interesse später z.B. an der Umsetzung von Anlagen in Deutschland zu Vorzugskonditionen beteiligen können; persönlich, indem sie mit ihrer finanziellen Unterstützung einen Beitrag zur Verbesserung und dem Erhalt der Lebensbedingungen leisten. TransparenzCrowdfunding ist definiert durch Transparenz. Das Finanzierungsziel ist konkret und greifbar ebenso wie das Mittel der Finanzierung und die Gegenleistung. Kein Renditeversprechen,  sondern eine klare Definition des Mehrwerts, der für den Unterstützer im Falle eines erfolgreichen Crowdfundings verbunden sein wird. Ist das Finanzierungsziel erreicht und das Projekt umgesetzt, hat der Unterstützer die Chance zu interessanten Konditionen in das Projekt mit überschaubaren Mitteln einzusteigen. In einer solchen Phase werden „normale“ Anleger nicht mehr aufgenommen, weil die zu erwartende Performance des Unternehmens viele größere Investoren anlockt, deren Verwaltung grundsätzlich einfacher ist. Wo kann man mehr über das Projekt erfahren?http://new-plastic-cycle.com",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<li>Secure order processing from the customer to the machine</li>
<li>Optional payment via Bitcoin (Bitpay); other crypto currencies are being evaluated</li>
<li>Safe maintenance management of the Manyfolds machines</li>
<li>Highly automated supply of consumables</li>
<li>Optimized and automated logistics to minimize the environmental footprint</li>
</ul><p> </p><h3>Why this idea</h3><p>During his many years as an innovation &amp; IT consultant Frank Thomsen held a large number of design thinking workshops, that included the preparation of paper- and cardboard-based workshop material – from the cardboard-smartphone to whole Point-of-Sale mockup designs.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517820331/jqy60uvtti6pp1ealjd2.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>During a preparation for one of the design thinking workshops, Frank thought: What if these preparations could be as automated and standardized as possible, so there would be a device, that prints the patterns on a standard-sized cardboard in one process, makes dents in the cardboard for better bending and then cuts them in the right places? Frank tried a few things in a CAD software, did some research and calculations, and finally designed and protected the Manyfolds machine that became the centerpiece of a completely new cardboard furniture business model.</p><p> </p><h3>Talking about the environment</h3><p>The main driver for founding this company and to develop this new cardboard furniture system is our belief that we should find solutions and opportunities that truly add value to people AND the environment. The consumables used at Manyfolds are light, almost completely biodegradable and the products are only manufactured if the individual customer actually needs them.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517824541/lefal5ni1n53ktwclbo0.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3><strong>A well prepared project – that needs your contribution</strong></h3><p>Since half a year a zillion preparations were made to make this idea a reality. We developed the Manyfolds platform concept, developed a air-tight business plan, secured domains, the name and the core technology, tested out different furniture designs, talked to many potential accessories providers, furniture designers, machine &amp; software developers, CAD providers, carton/cardboard manufacturers &amp; many, many more.</p><p>The good news: Manyfolds is not only technically possible, it definitely could have a huge impact on the furniture market and be very successful.</p><p>But we can’t do it alone. We need your help to make Manyfolds a reality.</p><p>By helping us in this concept stage, you will enable the following next steps:</p><ul>
<li>Moving into a bigger home base for Manyfolds:<br/>Well, it’s actually that simple. We need some space we can work in.</li>
<li>Machine developments: We are already in close talks with some German machine builders (yes, that will be ""Quality Made in Germany""!) that will not only provide the main engineering but also the realization of the machine itself</li>
<li>Software developments: The Manyfolds machine needs a standardized print/dent/cut data input to produce the furniture. This data will come out of a software that still has to be developed. It’s not rocket science, but it has to be done properly.</li>
<li>Shop development: Preparation and opening of our Manyfolds online shop, so that we can establish our general market reach.</li>
<li>PLUS: A successful campaign will help us A LOT to get additional “big” funding --&gt; for going the next steps (production of more machines, international business, etc.)</li>
</ul><p>Within this phase we will let you participate in the “making of Manyfolds”. We will establish our own YouTube Channel where you can see the progress we will make during the company build up + we will show you the ever evolving world of sustainable products &amp; accessories.</p><p> </p><h2><strong>What we need &amp; what you get</strong></h2><p>To make our vision a reality – eco-friendly cardboard furniture in hundreds of shapes &amp; sizes through a new standard technology and via a new cardboard furniture marketplace – will not come cheap. We aim to raise €100,000 through our crowdfunding campaign. With this initial funding we will be able to setup the company and get public funding on a greater scale.</p><p>We believe it can be done, because we thoroughly researched the needed human resources (expertise), the prices for machine development and machine manufacturing, the software development costs and many, many more details. And we calculated in real world scenarios, incl. market-entry costs and a realistic earnings ramp-up.</p><h3>You can be part of this eco-friendly furniture solution.</h3><p>Manyfolds will literally change the world for the better: Less used material, much less weight and therefore less transport-related pollution; a better “fit-to-need”, real recyclability. And be assured: The Manyfolds products will be a whole lot of fun, because they will be as unique, as you can imagine.</p><p>Start backing Manyfolds by ordering one of our perks. In this first Indiegogo Campaign you will find many interesting ways to enable us to start this exciting venture.</p><h2>The Impact</h2><p>Manyfolds could be one important piece of the big picture, to actually have less environmental impact on this beautiful earth. Just figure this: Every year approx. over 120 million tons<a href=""#_ftn1"" name=""_ftnref1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[1]</a> of new furniture is produced worldwide – and more than half of that number is getting dumped again, the majority without being recycled. The whole range of plastics, metals, glue, paint, etc. is left out there.</p><p>So by supporting Manyfolds, you will be an active part of reducing material usage and reducing waste. At the same time you can be part of <strong>a new furniture design paradigm</strong>, that will astound your collogues and friends alike. People will ""think"" furniture differently, when Manyfolds is introduced to the world market.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521490337/qv9isox6hrhywr572ab3.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2><p>Manyfolds is a new, partially disruptive concept in the furniture and furniture accessories industry. There are no direct competitors who have the same business model as Manyfolds. This has resulted in intensive research. Apart from the patent protection, the necessary processes, technologies and markets for this project already exist. They are merely recombined by Manyfolds. BUT: This combination is what Manyfolds is all about!</p><p>As with any company, the potential risks have to be anticipated and appropriate solutions have to be planned:</p><ul>
<li>Machine development could take longer than expected<br/>Solution: Thorough planning, precise specification, working with SCRUM processes, sprint planning</li>
<li>Market reach could be smaller than expected<br/>Solution: Intensive PR and social media coverage, working with Indiegogo campaign boosting tools, establishing a Manyfolds YouTube Channel</li>
<li>Appearance of imitators<br/>Solution: Very early cooperation with the major suppliers of cardboard furniture and pattern designers to minimize this source of imitators. Use of legal protection options. Early development of international partnerships, optional introduction of a franchise model, early cooperation with the most important carton / corrugated board manufacturers</li>
<li>Staffing the company could take longer<br/>Solution: There are many, very talented people who like to take on new challenges. These people will be activated, e.g. at universities, design schools &amp; engineering colleges. In addition, job advertisements are launched via the usual media, even in regions far from Munich. There will also be a cooperation with the employment office.</li>

Highly automated supply of consumables
Optimized and automated logistics to minimize the environmental footprint
 Why this ideaDuring his many years as an innovation & IT consultant Frank Thomsen held a large number of design thinking workshops, that included the preparation of paper- and cardboard-based workshop material – from the cardboard-smartphone to whole Point-of-Sale mockup designs.During a preparation for one of the design thinking workshops, Frank thought: What if these preparations could be as automated and standardized as possible, so there would be a device, that prints the patterns on a standard-sized cardboard in one process, makes dents in the cardboard for better bending and then cuts them in the right places? Frank tried a few things in a CAD software, did some research and calculations, and finally designed and protected the Manyfolds machine that became the centerpiece of a completely new cardboard furniture business model. Talking about the environmentThe main driver for founding this company and to develop this new cardboard furniture system is our belief that we should find solutions and opportunities that truly add value to people AND the environment. The consumables used at Manyfolds are light, almost completely biodegradable and the products are only manufactured if the individual customer actually needs them. A well prepared project – that needs your contributionSince half a year a zillion preparations were made to make this idea a reality. We developed the Manyfolds platform concept, developed a air-tight business plan, secured domains, the name and the core technology, tested out different furniture designs, talked to many potential accessories providers, furniture designers, machine & software developers, CAD providers, carton/cardboard manufacturers & many, many more.The good news: Manyfolds is not only technically possible, it definitely could have a huge impact on the furniture market and be very successful.But we can’t do it alone. We need your help to make Manyfolds a reality.By helping us in this concept stage, you will enable the following next steps:
Moving into a bigger home base for Manyfolds:Well, it’s actually that simple. We need some space we can work in.
Machine developments: We are already in close talks with some German machine builders (yes, that will be ""Quality Made in Germany""!) that will not only provide the main engineering but also the realization of the machine itself
Software developments: The Manyfolds machine needs a standardized print/dent/cut data input to produce the furniture. This data will come out of a software that still has to be developed. It’s not rocket science, but it has to be done properly.
Shop development: Preparation and opening of our Manyfolds online shop, so that we can establish our general market reach.
PLUS: A successful campaign will help us A LOT to get additional “big” funding --> for going the next steps (production of more machines, international business, etc.)
Within this phase we will let you participate in the “making of Manyfolds”. We will establish our own YouTube Channel where you can see the progress we will make during the company build up + we will show you the ever evolving world of sustainable products & accessories. What we need & what you getTo make our vision a reality – eco-friendly cardboard furniture in hundreds of shapes & sizes through a new standard technology and via a new cardboard furniture marketplace – will not come cheap. We aim to raise €100,000 through our crowdfunding campaign. With this initial funding we will be able to setup the company and get public funding on a greater scale.We believe it can be done, because we thoroughly researched the needed human resources (expertise), the prices for machine development and machine manufacturing, the software development costs and many, many more details. And we calculated in real world scenarios, incl. market-entry costs and a realistic earnings ramp-up.You can be part of this eco-friendly furniture solution.Manyfolds will literally change the world for the better: Less used material, much less weight and therefore less transport-related pollution; a better “fit-to-need”, real recyclability. And be assured: The Manyfolds products will be a whole lot of fun, because they will be as unique, as you can imagine.Start backing Manyfolds by ordering one of our perks. In this first Indiegogo Campaign you will find many interesting ways to enable us to start this exciting venture.The ImpactManyfolds could be one important piece of the big picture, to actually have less environmental impact on this beautiful earth. Just figure this: Every year approx. over 120 million tons[1] of new furniture is produced worldwide – and more than half of that number is getting dumped again, the majority without being recycled. The whole range of plastics, metals, glue, paint, etc. is left out there.So by supporting Manyfolds, you will be an active part of reducing material usage and reducing waste. At the same time you can be part of a new furniture design paradigm, that will astound your collogues and friends alike. People will ""think"" furniture differently, when Manyfolds is introduced to the world market. Risks & ChallengesManyfolds is a new, partially disruptive concept in the furniture and furniture accessories industry. There are no direct competitors who have the same business model as Manyfolds. This has resulted in intensive research. Apart from the patent protection, the necessary processes, technologies and markets for this project already exist. They are merely recombined by Manyfolds. BUT: This combination is what Manyfolds is all about!As with any company, the potential risks have to be anticipated and appropriate solutions have to be planned:
Machine development could take longer than expectedSolution: Thorough planning, precise specification, working with SCRUM processes, sprint planning
Market reach could be smaller than expectedSolution: Intensive PR and social media coverage, working with Indiegogo campaign boosting tools, establishing a Manyfolds YouTube Channel
Appearance of imitatorsSolution: Very early cooperation with the major suppliers of cardboard furniture and pattern designers to minimize this source of imitators. Use of legal protection options. Early development of international partnerships, optional introduction of a franchise model, early cooperation with the most important carton / corrugated board manufacturers
Staffing the company could take longerSolution: There are many, very talented people who like to take on new challenges. These people will be activated, e.g. at universities, design schools & engineering colleges. In addition, job advertisements are launched via the usual media, even in regions far from Munich. There will also be a cooperation with the employment office.
Other Ways You Can HelpSpread the word, spread the word, spread the word!Helping spread the word on social media or telling colleagues or friends about our campaign would not only be great but awesome! If you have any suggestions of ways you think you can help, please don't hesitate to reach out to us by email (hello@manyfolds.com) or social media. We would love to hear from you and will answer your inquiries as soon as possible.

0 FOSSIL FUEL CONSUMPTION, 0 EMISSIONS.The power station can work all the time under the supporting of solar energy without creating any wastes. Ares is built to power any devices in your life. Bring Ares to a party or your room to get uninterrupted power for everyone.Charge and recharge at the same timeThe UPS feature makes ARES even more extraordinary. When ARES detects a power failure, it automatically switches from commercial power supply to inverter power supply from the built-in storage battery within 0.01 seconds.Independent charging and discharging circuit modules allow you to power or charge your devices while simultaneously recharging the Ares. 4x 1,000W(2,000W Max) AC OutputsThere are 4 AC outputs rated power up to 1,000W, peak power 2,000W (5S), they can carry multiple household equipment at the same time, such as CPAP, TV, computer, refrigerator, LED lights, etc.    The Astronautic High Density batteries, provides larger capacity with smaller size. The LFP lithium iron phosphate battery (LifePO4) has high thermal stability and excellent safety. It is durable for up to 10 years with the 3,500 times cycle life.112x 14S8P 26,650 Cells The remaining battery power, frequency, charge/discharge status, and error code are displayed on the LCD in an easy to understand way.The USB-C port supports the fastest 60W PD output, you can charge the 13"" MacBook Pro to 80% in 80 minutes and you can fully charge your Ares in 8 hours. The 18W USB ports enable 3x faster charging for all your smart devices, You can charge your iPhone Xs Max to 85% in just 45 minutes. The cigarette lighter socket provides convenient DC output in the car when you're traveling. When using a competitor product, you have a bulky adapter, which converts electricity from alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC). Charging your product requires you to carry a cable with a big brick converter on it and recharges your product very slowly. However, we’ve found a way to charge ARES directly with AC, with only a simple cable and no brick converter.  Solar Charging Input up to 15V-40V(150W Max). Ares is great for camping, hiking, emergencies, or wherever your adventures may take you.Solar Panel SpecsCamping power, RV Trip, Emergency, Medical Power, BEST MATE EVER! For families who rely on medical devices such like a CPAP machine or a medical fridge, a power outage could be a disaster.

</div>
</div></div>","Solar power is the future and at GoSun, we're making it more easy, fun and accessible than ever. Since 2013, our breakthrough solar ovens have reached more than 15,000 happy customers in +60 countries, in large part thanks to the Kickstarter community. (Thanks, everyone!)Listening to feedback from our community, our goal was to make a stove portable and durable enough to take anywhere, with the power to boil water, at a price point accessible to all.        
   
Cooks Most Meals In 20-30 Minutes
14oz /420ml Capacity
Stays Hot for Hours
    
13.5oz / 400ml Capacity

Make Tea and Coffee in 30 Minutes, Reach a Rolling Boil in 45 

Just adjust the Go's base and set vertically to boil. A removable cap detaches from the tray handle to keep the heat in. Perfect for tea, coffee, dehydrated foods and sterilizing water.    
2lbs / .9kg
Shock Absorbing EVA Foam Exterior
Zipping up into a durable compression molded EVA foam clamshell, the Go was designed to absorb impacts. Completely submersible and saltwater tolerant, the Go is ready for adventure on land and sea.     Cooks In Clouds: GoSun's patented solar cooking technology absorbs a broad spectrum of radiation, including ultraviolet light, which can penetrate clouds when visible light can not. This means as long as you have a bit of sun, you're in business. No Weather Too Cold: GoSun's Vacuum Tube is a near-perfect insulator, keeping the cold out and the heat in. Always Cool To Touch: No fire hazard here. Perfect for cooking on boats or during a fire ban.   Our flagship model, the GoSun Sport, in action.   Our Secret: Outer Space Trapped Inside a TubeFirst, sunlight from both direct and diffused sources (ie clouds) is reflected by the Go's compound-parabolic reflectors onto a double-walled tube with a vacuum pulled inside. This tube then converts the light into heat and traps it inside of the vacuum layer, providing extraordinary insulation, keeping the heat in and the cold out. Cool right?      Unparalleled EfficiencyGoSun's solar vacuum tubes are far more efficient than most solar panels at turning sunlight into usable heat. (It's ok, solar panels are still awesome.) This is thanks to the power of the tube's selective absorbing surface which leverages aluminum-nitride to absorb +80% of the radiation it hits. 
 
 
       
 Universal Action Mount - Stay on the Go
  
Connect your GoSun Go to anything using an integrated, universal three-finger mount. Mounting accessories purchased separately enable attachment to: bike, boat, tripod, rail/pole, pack, limb, etc.

 
Silicone Pans - Back and Serve like a Pro
Four re-usable, non-stick silicone pans custom built for your GoSun (two fit at a time). Appetizers are served while another meal is loaded, sweet in one, savory the other. Sauce or dough won’t mix with other foods and your clean-up got even easier.

<h2>Take Climate Solutions Into Your Own Hands</h2>
<p>Even the best of us can’t end all of our carbon emissions. And that sucks. Because the consequences of the climate crisis are all around us.</p>
<p>We created Negative to make it easy for you to take climate solutions into your own hands. By backing our campaign, you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help us become a major customer of direct air capture (DAC), a technology that reverses climate change.<br/> </li>
<li>Pay to remove carbon emissions from the atmosphere, making your bracelet carbon-negative.<br/> </li>
<li>Show investors, corporations, and politicians that we want all products to go Negative.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Oh, and you’ll get this crazy bracelet we made out of thin air.</i></p>
<p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573060121/plnqtpz6fqkfczhf4b0y.jpg"" src=""""/></i></p>
<h2>Wear a Bracelet Made From Thin Air (and other stuff, too)</h2>
<p>Negative is a bracelet made with captured atmospheric carbon emissions. This stuff would be heating up our planet. Now it’s tied up your wrist.</p>
<p>The bracelet’s beads are where the magic happens. Each bead is a blend of atmospheric carbon and naturally-sourced clay. Natural fibers hold the beads together, and the whole thing is secured on your wrist with a magnetic clasp.</p>
<p>These atmospheric ingredients didn’t exist outside the lab until recently, so we’re still learning what’s possible. Our ultimate goal is to make a bracelet that is 100% atmospheric carbon (Air Diamonds, anyone?!), and this bracelet is a first step in that direction.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573060142/hq7l2rwdg2h28hjlngik.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2>Support Cutting-Edge Climate Technology </h2>
<p>To create Negative, we teamed up with two of the world’s leading climate technology startups: Climeworks and Carbon Upcycling Technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Carbon on Your Wrist</strong>: The carbon contained in each Negative bracelet is provided by Carbon Upcycling Technologies (CUT). This team of scientists and engineers invented a way to store concentrated CO2 in solid materials. CUT is a finalist in the Carbon XPRIZE, a global competition to transform CO2 into usable products.</p>
<p><strong>Carbon in the Bank</strong>: To make Negative live up to its name, we needed to do more than put carbon in the bracelet. To reverse the CO2 emitted during manufacturing and shipping each bracelet, we’ve turned to Climeworks. This insanely cool company created the world’s first commercial-scale carbon removal technology. Their innovative machines can capture CO2 from ambient air and then it’s pumped underground and turned into stone. This locks up the carbon for good.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573060183/yij8szsjuezbd8m7ygrb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We think these two companies—and others like them—are doing the most important engineering research in the world. If they can solve this problem affordably and at scale, this technology will literally save our planet (and, you know, all of us who live here).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this technology receives a shockingly small amount of investment. We aim to change that! By backing our campaign, you’ll help us become a major buyer of Direct Air Capture (DAC) carbon. And you’ll help us demonstrate that there is a huge level of consumer demand for products that go negative.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573060205/wvcgxgifdiqlhklbbjnb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2>Set the Standard for Carbon Products</h2>
<p>In the coming months and years, we expect many companies to tout their “climate-friendly” products. (For better or worse, you can put carbon in pretty much anything!)</p>
<p>Ultimately, we think this is a good thing for climate technology. But there is a significant risk that carbon content becomes the new greenwashing.</p>
<p>So we want Negative to set a standard for anyone making climate claims about their products. We will pay for direct air capture (DAC) to physically capture and store more CO2 than our product emits. If a little bracelet company can do it, Fortune 500 companies can, too.</p>
<p>We envision a future where every product we buy is carbon-negative. By supporting our campaign, you’ll help us set the bar high. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573060226/p4ctjc8bvxmpoirvexex.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Choose Your Style and Size</h3>
<p>We feel great about wearing our Negative bracelets, and we know you will too! After experimenting with different materials and styles, we settled on three types of Negative bracelet:</p>
<p><strong>Negative 2X Black</strong>: Our entry-level bracelet is made of natural clay, atmospheric carbon, natural fiber, and a magnetic clasp. Your pledge will also pay to directly capture <strong>2X (200%)</strong> of all CO2 emitted during manufacturing and shipping, making your bracelet carbon-negative. (Just imagine if all products did this!)</p>
<p><strong>Negative 5X Silver</strong>: Our premium bracelet adds a sterling silver bead that will start conversations about climate solutions. Your pledge will also pay to directly <strong>capture 5X (500%) </strong>of the CO2 emitted during manufacturing and shipping.</p>
<p><strong>Negative 10X Gold</strong>: This limited edition bracelet adds a stunning 18k gold bead that will catch everyone's eye. At this reward level, your pledge will pay to directly capture <strong>10X (1,000%)</strong> the CO2 emitted during manufacturing and shipping.</p>
<p>Like any jewelry product, it’s important to get the right fit. After the campaign, we’ll send a survey to get your sizing preferences. Sizes will range from fitting a 5.5” wrist (child size) to an 8.5” wrist.</p>
<h2>Our Production Timeline</h2>
<p>We have already lined up the team and materials necessary to create your Negative bracelet. This timeline shows the remaining steps to get Negative onto your wrist:</p>

<p>Tito is obsessed with climate solutions. He quit his job in the biotech industry to start AirMiners, the world’s largest community of carbon sequestration professionals. At the time, virtually no one was talking about direct air capture (DAC). But today, the community has grown to more than 300 scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs who are hellbent on solving the climate crisis.</p>
<p>Miraculously, the technology these pioneers created actually works. But the one thing they lacked was customers. So Tito decided to start making consumer products out of carbon emissions. He figured that if people could hold a piece of the solution, reversing climate change would suddenly feel possible.</p>
<p>Tito’s first product was a batch of planters...the kind you can put on your desk. They were made from a mix of concrete and captured CO2.</p>
<p>People went bananas. The Air Planter sold out in under an hour.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the planters were financially and environmentally expensive. So Tito set out to make something equally inspiring with a much lighter carbon footprint. And the Negative bracelet was born.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573060374/dmo5hac4t2uf89olmuwb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Like all great entrepreneurs, Tito doesn’t work alone. The Negative team now includes two professional jewelers, a mechanical engineer, a visual designer, a product marketer, and a global network of materials specialists. We’re also lining up craft jewelry-makers to create our bracelets sustainably at scale.</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>Making use of carbon dioxide is a new and important process. The riskiest part of this project is working with these new materials to get them to function excellently and look beautiful.</p>
<p>We've prototyped our bracelets with carbon materials and have learned a lot along the way about functionality and aesthetics. We've also already shipped a first product, our cement planters which are already in people's hands. Our terrific team includes talents in mechanical engineering, design for manufacturing, and experience manufacturing and shipping products around the world.</p>

So we want Negative to set a standard for anyone making climate claims about their products. We will pay for direct air capture (DAC) to physically capture and store more CO2 than our product emits. If a little bracelet company can do it, Fortune 500 companies can, too.
We envision a future where every product we buy is carbon-negative. By supporting our campaign, you’ll help us set the bar high. 

Choose Your Style and Size
We feel great about wearing our Negative bracelets, and we know you will too! After experimenting with different materials and styles, we settled on three types of Negative bracelet:
Negative 2X Black: Our entry-level bracelet is made of natural clay, atmospheric carbon, natural fiber, and a magnetic clasp. Your pledge will also pay to directly capture 2X (200%) of all CO2 emitted during manufacturing and shipping, making your bracelet carbon-negative. (Just imagine if all products did this!)
Negative 5X Silver: Our premium bracelet adds a sterling silver bead that will start conversations about climate solutions. Your pledge will also pay to directly capture 5X (500%) of the CO2 emitted during manufacturing and shipping.
Negative 10X Gold: This limited edition bracelet adds a stunning 18k gold bead that will catch everyone's eye. At this reward level, your pledge will pay to directly capture 10X (1,000%) the CO2 emitted during manufacturing and shipping.
Like any jewelry product, it’s important to get the right fit. After the campaign, we’ll send a survey to get your sizing preferences. Sizes will range from fitting a 5.5” wrist (child size) to an 8.5” wrist.
Our Production Timeline
We have already lined up the team and materials necessary to create your Negative bracelet. This timeline shows the remaining steps to get Negative onto your wrist:
 
Meet the Team
Who the &*$# decides to make jewelry out of carbon emissions?
This guy.

Tito is obsessed with climate solutions. He quit his job in the biotech industry to start AirMiners, the world’s largest community of carbon sequestration professionals. At the time, virtually no one was talking about direct air capture (DAC). But today, the community has grown to more than 300 scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs who are hellbent on solving the climate crisis.
Miraculously, the technology these pioneers created actually works. But the one thing they lacked was customers. So Tito decided to start making consumer products out of carbon emissions. He figured that if people could hold a piece of the solution, reversing climate change would suddenly feel possible.
Tito’s first product was a batch of planters...the kind you can put on your desk. They were made from a mix of concrete and captured CO2.
People went bananas. The Air Planter sold out in under an hour.
Unfortunately, the planters were financially and environmentally expensive. So Tito set out to make something equally inspiring with a much lighter carbon footprint. And the Negative bracelet was born.

Like all great entrepreneurs, Tito doesn’t work alone. The Negative team now includes two professional jewelers, a mechanical engineer, a visual designer, a product marketer, and a global network of materials specialists. We’re also lining up craft jewelry-makers to create our bracelets sustainably at scale.

Join Our Campaign
We believe that everyone has their own part to play in creating climate solutions.
For Climeworks and Carbon Upcycling Technologies, it’s inventing the technology.
For the Negative team, it’s making the solution feel real by putting it in your hands.
Now we need your help. To support direct air capture. To show that consumers demand carbon-negative products. To set the bar high. And to make a bracelet out of thin air!

Risks and challenges
Making use of carbon dioxide is a new and important process. The riskiest part of this project is working with these new materials to get them to function excellently and look beautiful.
We've prototyped our bracelets with carbon materials and have learned a lot along the way about functionality and aesthetics. We've also already shipped a first product, our cement planters which are already in people's hands. Our terrific team includes talents in mechanical engineering, design for manufacturing, and experience manufacturing and shipping products around the world.",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

than forty years. He has handled electronic equipment contracts for airports
and other secured locations throughout the country.</p>
<p>In the energy industry, he has developed more

of the U-Plug for two years. The current production model went through
independent testing in February and March, 2015 at an energy power testing facility in the State of Missouri. 
We are bringing this generator to the public market
to help offset the use of fossil fuels, and to help clean the air for
everyone.  Our generator will save people
money, and provide power in any natural disaster, and is also the 
perfect
system for homes to be totally off-grid.This generator is only 24 inches
 tall, 6 inches in diameter,  produces 115 volts at 17.3 amps of power, 
and weighs only 20 pounds. That is truly a powerful generator in a 
compact size.<br/><br/><p>When you contribute to our campaign you will be
helping to save our natural resources, while cleaning our air, saving our
precious water, and making the world a better place for everyone.</p>
<h3>
</h3>
<h3>How it works <br/>
</h3>
<p>We developed a simplified planetary gear system with multiple shafts that have our magnets in them. Each magnet can pick up over 2500 pounds each. There are several magnets per shaft, and when they are in the proper position they begin to spin. This will cause a push pull type of effect that has  worked quite well for over 2 1/2 years. Then we surround the unit with the field coils to generate the power.</p>
<p>We cannot give to much more info without divulging our secrets, so we have kept this explanation as simple as it is.</p>
<p>The U-Plug Green system will generate between 17.25 amps and 19.25 amps. and is controlled by 2 circuit boards located at the top of the unit. We have set the unit at 2000 watts maximum for reliability.  <br/></p>
<p>The circuit boards control the speed, amperage, and the output wattage so that the coils are not damaged. Other safety devices inside the unit are provided in case water gets inside, and to protect it from overheating.</p>
<p>Maximum operating temp, Fahrenheit,  is 125 degrees and so far we have found that the unit will operate at -60 degrees with no problems.</p>
<p>When you purchase our product it comes with a 3 year warranty.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>We are seeking $250,000 for building space,
raw materials, and additional workers. We know that this only begins our journey
together.  We also know that the U-Plug Green Generator will attract additional interest and additional funding once
you begin to envision how the generator will help you, your friends and
family.  A generator that can sit inside
your home, at your camp site, or work site, while making virtually no noise,
is a generator you will love to own.  In
turn, your friends and family will love to own one for themselves, and will
help us sell many more units.</p>
<p>Should as few as 1500 people choose to buy their own
unit from this campaign, we will have raised all the funds necessary to
complete our factory, order the raw materials, train the workers, and begin
production, without seeking outside funding. From those 1500 people, we would
raise $2,242,500, allowing us to reach full production more quickly than we
have anticipated.  We would then be able
to make decisions that impact the way we can produce more units.  </p>
<p>Should you as a contributor purchase one of these
units and then purchase a grid-tie unit from the internet, you would be able to
use your generator to make your electric meter run backwards. Yes, it will go
backwards at times, and the power company will have to pay you for your power.
As you can see, your unit will pay for itself many times and in many ways, as
you use your U-Plug Green generator.</p>

<br/>We have special pricing of $1,495.00 on the U-Plug
Green generator for those who order during this campaign only.  After this campaign, the price will be
$1,795.00 each. That is an instant savings of $300.00 for everyone who orders
now.
<p>There are also dealership pricing packages for those
who want to help us and grow your business at the same time. <br/></p>

<br/>
<p>Our 10 pack or more generator packages allow our subscribers
to become distributors.  As distributors,
we will work with you to help you be successful in retailing the U-Plug
Green generators. In accordance with that goal, there will be semi-annual reviews to
evaluate the performance of our distributors, making recommendations and
changes as needed.</p>

Should we not reach our goal, we will continue to
build 1 unit for one person, one household, one business, one community at a
time.  We believe in those who see this as
a necessary product which is needed and wanted worldwide, so every dollar we
receive will go to bring this generator to each of you. 
Every person that contributes to this campaign will receive a gift certificate for $100.00 off the MSRP, simply email us your address and we will send you one for future use.<br/><br/><p></p>

<br/><br/><br/><h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You, as one of our contributors, will have peace
of mind knowing you have a generator which can provide clean power in all
situations you will encounter.  You will
also be on the forefront of green energy production, which will lead to cleaner
air and water for our world.  You will
feel comfortable and confident that you will be helping to reduce dangerous and
harmful pollutants.   </p>
<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have been working on the U-Plug Green generator for
several years.  The result, as you can
see in the videos, are generators ready for mass production.  We have achieved a continuous running,
portable generator where all others have failed.  However, this is not perpetual motion; the
generator will eventually slow down and stop producing electricity in about 20 years when there is to much magnetic loss.  </p>
<p>We have assembled a team of business professionals
for every stage of our project, including accountants, attorneys, risk management advisors, electrical
technicians, machinists, state business managers, and skilled laborers.<span>  </span></p>

We developed a simplified planetary gear system with multiple shafts that have our magnets in them. Each magnet can pick up over 2500 pounds each. There are several magnets per shaft, and when they are in the proper position they begin to spin. This will cause a push pull type of effect that has  worked quite well for over 2 1/2 years. Then we surround the unit with the field coils to generate the power.
We cannot give to much more info without divulging our secrets, so we have kept this explanation as simple as it is.
The U-Plug Green system will generate between 17.25 amps and 19.25 amps. and is controlled by 2 circuit boards located at the top of the unit. We have set the unit at 2000 watts maximum for reliability.  
The circuit boards control the speed, amperage, and the output wattage so that the coils are not damaged. Other safety devices inside the unit are provided in case water gets inside, and to protect it from overheating.
Maximum operating temp, Fahrenheit,  is 125 degrees and so far we have found that the unit will operate at -60 degrees with no problems.
When you purchase our product it comes with a 3 year warranty.

Timeline of progress



What We Need & What You Get

We are seeking $250,000 for building space,
raw materials, and additional workers. We know that this only begins our journey
together.  We also know that the U-Plug Green Generator will attract additional interest and additional funding once
you begin to envision how the generator will help you, your friends and
family.  A generator that can sit inside
your home, at your camp site, or work site, while making virtually no noise,
is a generator you will love to own.  In
turn, your friends and family will love to own one for themselves, and will
help us sell many more units.
Should as few as 1500 people choose to buy their own
unit from this campaign, we will have raised all the funds necessary to
complete our factory, order the raw materials, train the workers, and begin
production, without seeking outside funding. From those 1500 people, we would
raise $2,242,500, allowing us to reach full production more quickly than we
have anticipated.  We would then be able
to make decisions that impact the way we can produce more units.  
Should you as a contributor purchase one of these
units and then purchase a grid-tie unit from the internet, you would be able to
use your generator to make your electric meter run backwards. Yes, it will go
backwards at times, and the power company will have to pay you for your power.
As you can see, your unit will pay for itself many times and in many ways, as
you use your U-Plug Green generator.
   
We have special pricing of $1,495.00 on the U-Plug
Green generator for those who order during this campaign only.  After this campaign, the price will be
$1,795.00 each. That is an instant savings of $300.00 for everyone who orders
now.
There are also dealership pricing packages for those
who want to help us and grow your business at the same time. 



Our 10 pack or more generator packages allow our subscribers
to become distributors.  As distributors,
we will work with you to help you be successful in retailing the U-Plug
Green generators. In accordance with that goal, there will be semi-annual reviews to
evaluate the performance of our distributors, making recommendations and
changes as needed.

Should we not reach our goal, we will continue to
build 1 unit for one person, one household, one business, one community at a
time.  We believe in those who see this as
a necessary product which is needed and wanted worldwide, so every dollar we
receive will go to bring this generator to each of you. 
Every person that contributes to this campaign will receive a gift certificate for $100.00 off the MSRP, simply email us your address and we will send you one for future use.

The Impact
You, as one of our contributors, will have peace
of mind knowing you have a generator which can provide clean power in all
situations you will encounter.  You will
also be on the forefront of green energy production, which will lead to cleaner
air and water for our world.  You will
feel comfortable and confident that you will be helping to reduce dangerous and
harmful pollutants.   

  Risks & Challenges
We have been working on the U-Plug Green generator for
several years.  The result, as you can
see in the videos, are generators ready for mass production.  We have achieved a continuous running,
portable generator where all others have failed.  However, this is not perpetual motion; the
generator will eventually slow down and stop producing electricity in about 20 years when there is to much magnetic loss.  
We have assembled a team of business professionals
for every stage of our project, including accountants, attorneys, risk management advisors, electrical
technicians, machinists, state business managers, and skilled laborers.       

 Other Ways You Can Help
Be sure to tell your friends about this clean new 
generator, we are grateful for your help. You can spread the word on 
Facebook or anywhere you may go.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Hydrogen fuel is a ‘zero emission’ fuel capable of providing motive power to vehicles, such as cars, boats, aircrafts, and rockets, as well as electrical power to devices, such as those involved in manufacture. The production of hydrogen fuel requires pure hydrogen, and since this is not naturally available in large quantities, it must be acquired via techniques that are very energy intensive, mostly by burning fossil fuels. As such, the environmental costs involved in hydrogen fuel production negate a large portion of the environmental benefits seen in hydrogen fuel use.</p>

Powerfilm modules have been used for applications ranging from solar tents for the Army, solar bikinis and even powering electronics on a solar yacht to Venus.</p><p>President Frank Jeffrey is one of two founders of PowerFilm, Inc. Frank has been involved in the solar community for over 30 years. With a history of successful business contracts, Jeffrey is excited to take the tested and proven thin-film technology to consumers via the LightSaver Max.</p><p>Ryan Jeffrey, PowerFilm’s Product Development Manager has led the charge in bringing the LightSaver line to fruition. Ryan has been with PowerFilm for 10 years and has been an integral part of the company’s product diversification efforts.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Risks and Challenges</strong></h3><p>This is a prototype and therefore tweaks continue to be done. We haven't had the funding to have a larger quantity of prototypes made for testing or reviews. </p><p>Other solar panels do not have the advantage of an integrated battery and we consider this one of our most important features. However, it does present a challenge in getting all these parts to play well together.</p><p>Another challenge is maximizing the power available from the 12V output. Careful thermal management is critical in a densely packed system like the LightSaver Max, and we have very conservative thermal safeties in place in the system which requires very careful design in the high power 12V output to maximize the amount of time it can run at the full 60W.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>FAQ</strong></h3><p><strong>How long does it take to charge this device?</strong><br/>One full day of good sun or about 2.5 hours from 12-volt input (car charger or wall charger). 4 - 12 hours if using USB.</p><p><strong>What devices can I charge?</strong><br/>Any USB devices (GoPro, cameras, flashlights, cell phones, tablets, Bluetooth speakers), small laptops and some larger laptops (depending on power draw) from 12-volt output.</p><p><strong>Are there any devices I can't charge using the Max?</strong><br/>Anything with either an instantaneous or continuous draw of over 60 watts. Certain power adapters have extremely noisy (electrical noise) draws that can produce brief draws over 60 watts even if they are rated under 60-watts. Devices like these can still charge, but they will cycle on and off intermittently due to current spikes.</p><p><strong>Can I repair or replace cells?</strong><br/>Batteries are not replaceable. Solar cells are essentially non-replaceable, but due to their durability and the minor impact on power when damaged, the panel will continue functioning for a long time despite broken cells.</p><p><strong>Can multiple LightSaver Max units be daisy chained together?</strong><br/>No. Based on the all inclusive design, you could take one of our rollables or folders and plug that into the 12 volt input for additional solar charging/power. </p><p><strong>Why does your technology cost more than other products I've seen?</strong><br/>Each product is manufactured for its purpose vs. other technologies that are produced with economies of scale, often in other countries that use low-cost labor, have government subsidies to back their production and minimal quality standards. With products of similar manufacturing quality, we are competitive in pricing.

Only one and a half pounds and slimmer than a water bottle, you can just throw it in your bag and carry it with you.Our solar technology is also durable and long lasting. If individual cells are damaged, it won't destroy the whole unit, and will have very minimal effect on the overall power or charge time of the Max.Other solar technology will only provide power in full sunlight. Not to fear - the LightSaver Max works even if it's cloudy or you're in a shaded location.Conveniently charge up indoors or with the solar panel stowed, which means you don't have to adjust your lifestyle or location just to power up!Use either of the 2 available USB ports or both simultaneously to charge your devices. Use CasesThe LightSaver Max is useful in so many different scenarios. The solar cells can be collecting sunlight while you are on the move or staying still. Because of the integrated battery, the power you collected can be used later, even if it's indoors or at night!Consider using the Max for any of these activities and more!

 About Amorphous Silicon TechnologyMost solar panels use other solar technologies, such as mono crystalline. Mono crystalline is highly fragile and if one cell is damaged, the entire panel is rendered useless and will need to be replaced. A solar product made with the amorphous silicon (a-Si) technology continues to work, with impact to the usability relative to the breadth of cell damage. Damage to one cell will have minimal impact. Check out this video where we fill our solar panel with bullet holes!A mono crystalline panel will shut down completely when any cell within the panel is covered by an object. Those panels requires full sun coverage to operate, while PowerFilm's panels continue to absorb solar energy.  In addition to these advantages, a-Si is thin, lightweight, relatively inexpensive, and more environmentally friendly because it does not contain toxic heavy metals such as cadmium or lead like some other solar technologies. How Max Stands Up to the Competition There are many mobile charging options out there, but the majority fall short.Most solar panels lack an integrated battery. This means you have to leave your device plugged in and under direct sunlight to be charged. Not only could excessive sun exposure heat and harm your device, but achieving the perfect angle relative to the sun is incredibly tedious.Many solar companies rely on outsourced mono or poly crystalline solar panels that aren't tested before leaving factories. These panels are bulky and will continue to perform under their advertised specifications.One competitive solar charger relies on organic solar technology, which carries incredible degradation making the panel less and less efficient as time passes. Not only that, but organic solar technology only captures energy from the sun at 1-3% efficiency.The Max solves the issue of internal power, shading performance and was designed with efficiency in mind by solar experts. Each step of the process was carefully monitored to ensure the most efficient energy transfer possible. Weighing in at only 1.5 pounds, the Max is far and away the best complete solar solution. Specifications  PerksAll-In BundlePowerFilm has created other great solar products that we want to make available to our supporters during this campaign. If you choose to support our All-In Bundle level, you will receive one LightSaver Max, one original LightSaver and one Pocket LightSaver.PocketOur pocket-sized solar panel has most of the same great features of the Max at an even more portable size. The LightSaver Pocket weighs only 3.5 ounces and stows to 4.5"" x  1.5"". With one 5V USB port, the Pocket can charge most USB powered devices with the exception of tablets. The LightSaver Pocket also has an integrated battery for charging your devices anywhere, anytime.Original LightSaverOur original LightSaver is a little smaller than the Max and a little simpler, with a single 5V USB port. The LightSaver will charge all USB powered devices, including tablets (you will not be able to charge your laptop with this product). The original LightSaver weighs in at just 4.9 oz and stows to 1.5"" x 7.75"".  Development/Timeline *May 2017  Why We're CrowdfundingThese funds will be used to alleviate high upfront production costs and enable us to deliver the LightSaver Max as soon as possible. We will have tooling costs, and will need a large production run to get unit prices down, so getting preorders on Indiegogo is the ideal solution for making this happen.We also hope to learn a lot through the process about interest in our product, reactions to it and suggestions for it. By the time we deliver, we will have a product that will please the masses. About the TeamPowerFilm has been developing and manufacturing its unique flexible solar module technology for nearly three decades, making it one of the few, and maybe the oldest, surviving solar manufacturers in the United States. Powerfilm modules have been used for applications ranging from solar tents for the Army, solar bikinis and even powering electronics on a solar yacht to Venus.President Frank Jeffrey is one of two founders of PowerFilm, Inc. Frank has been involved in the solar community for over 30 years. With a history of successful business contracts, Jeffrey is excited to take the tested and proven thin-film technology to consumers via the LightSaver Max.Ryan Jeffrey, PowerFilm’s Product Development Manager has led the charge in bringing the LightSaver line to fruition. Ryan has been with PowerFilm for 10 years and has been an integral part of the company’s product diversification efforts. Risks and ChallengesThis is a prototype and therefore tweaks continue to be done. We haven't had the funding to have a larger quantity of prototypes made for testing or reviews. Other solar panels do not have the advantage of an integrated battery and we consider this one of our most important features. However, it does present a challenge in getting all these parts to play well together.Another challenge is maximizing the power available from the 12V output. Careful thermal management is critical in a densely packed system like the LightSaver Max, and we have very conservative thermal safeties in place in the system which requires very careful design in the high power 12V output to maximize the amount of time it can run at the full 60W. FAQHow long does it take to charge this device?One full day of good sun or about 2.5 hours from 12-volt input (car charger or wall charger). 4 - 12 hours if using USB.What devices can I charge?Any USB devices (GoPro, cameras, flashlights, cell phones, tablets, Bluetooth speakers), small laptops and some larger laptops (depending on power draw) from 12-volt output.Are there any devices I can't charge using the Max?Anything with either an instantaneous or continuous draw of over 60 watts. Certain power adapters have extremely noisy (electrical noise) draws that can produce brief draws over 60 watts even if they are rated under 60-watts. Devices like these can still charge, but they will cycle on and off intermittently due to current spikes.Can I repair or replace cells?Batteries are not replaceable. Solar cells are essentially non-replaceable, but due to their durability and the minor impact on power when damaged, the panel will continue functioning for a long time despite broken cells.Can multiple LightSaver Max units be daisy chained together?No. Based on the all inclusive design, you could take one of our rollables or folders and plug that into the 12 volt input for additional solar charging/power. Why does your technology cost more than other products I've seen?Each product is manufactured for its purpose vs. other technologies that are produced with economies of scale, often in other countries that use low-cost labor, have government subsidies to back their production and minimal quality standards. With products of similar manufacturing quality, we are competitive in pricing. All of our products are made in the USA!What, if any, warranty exists on this product?PowerFilm, Inc. warrants that this PowerFilm® Solar product is free from defects in materials and workmanship that impact performance for a period of two (2) years. The duration of the Limited Warranty is from the date of initial purchase. The warranty does not apply to any defect, failure or damage caused by improper use, unauthorized modifications, neglect, improper testing, attempt to repair, inadequate maintenance, or damage from accident, fire, abuse or other hazard. PowerFilm`s sole obligation and liability for products failing to comply with this warranty shall be, at PowerFilm's choice, either to repair the products or replace the defective product with a new or re-manufactured equivalent at no charge, provided that the warranty procedures have been followed.",24.0,2,"1 Campaign

Kalisaya's social responsibility:
2041 - THE ANTARCTICA INITIATIVE




Kalisaya has selected 2041.com headed by Robert Swan, as the
non-profit organization to receive KaliPAK donations. Kalisaya and 2041 have announced a joint
effort to promote the preservation of Antarctica by encouraging recycling,
renewable energy and sustainability initiatives to combat the effects of
climate change.
2041 was founded by polar explorer, environmental leader and
public speaker Robert Swan, OBE, who is the first person in history to walk to
both the North and South Poles.





Kalisaya builds on Swan's dedication by informing, engaging
and inspiring the next generation of leaders to take responsibility, to be
sustainable, and to know that now is the time for action in policy development,
business generation and future technologies.
Kalisaya will donate customized KaliPAK systems to Robert Swan’s
Antarctica Energy Challenge 2016. These units will undergo special enhancements
in order to provide
autonomous, solar-based energy under prolonged low temperature conditions.
Additionally,
a percentage of each KaliPAK sold here on Indiegogo will be donated to 2041.com
and the important pursuits of Robert Swan.

Mistbox has developed a custom water treatment system to ensure the fine misting can not damage the AC unit. The patent pending method kills bacteria on contact and treats metal surfaces to make algae or mold growth an impossibility. The method also neutralizes dissolved solids (hardness) in the water so they cannot tightly adhere to the condenser fins. The Mistbox filters have been designed to work with municipal water anywhere in the continental US. </p><p>Take a closer look at our water treatment filter and see for yourself. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://mistboxlaunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/MISTBOX-FILTER-TECH-V6.gif"" src=""""/></p><p><b>The Best Of The Best</b></p><p>Since water treatment is such an important topic, Mistbox enlisted top water treatment expert Owen Boyd to help us get it right. Owen entered the world of environmental remediation in 1988 and developed a patented technology for the removal of carbon dioxide from combined cycle power plants. He later commercialized this technology for Dow Chemical. Owen's journey in water treatment started in 1992, and he has brought several new technologies to market: </p><ul>
<li><i>Developed chelating mercury removal resin to reduce mercury emissions from incinerators and coal burning power plants.</i></li>
<li><i>Developed a mercury removal system for dental waste discharge, which is used internationally by thousands of dental clinics. </i></li>
<li><i><i>In partnership with LeHigh University, developed a regenerable arsenic removable media that is used in many U.S. municipal systems and thousands of U.S. homes.</i></i></li>
<li><i>Developed patent pending system for removal of solids from high TDS water. </i></li>
<li><i>Developed a patent pending process linking ozone with quantum catalyst technology for disinfection of water used in medical applications. </i></li>
</ul><p>Needless to say, he knows his stuff. He was also awarded a Technology Innovator Award from the EPA in 1996, among many other accolades and recognition. So you can feel confident that the Mistbox water treatment system is the best of the best.</p><div> </div><div data-id=""17019835""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1501697331/ris0msyflzyszezl36ah.png"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><div data-id=""17102872""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1501697332/aov0hqz8bmbaworwitaj.png"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><div data-id=""17108607""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504282232/khoqdn30qdoxfl9l136i.png"" src=""""/></p>

</ul></div>","Mistbox delivers more savings for less effort than any other device. Learn how: 
Many connected devices only save energy when their owners are involved. Take a smart learning thermostat for example. You have to continually train it until it knows your preferences and can optimize for savings. That's fine and good, but what happens if you teach it bad habits or don't take the time to teach it at all? Don't we all want to save energy, even if we aren't so efficient ourselves? Enter Mistbox. Mistbox maximizes energy savings with no changes to your daily habits and no sacrificing your personal comfort. The result is proven savings, and you don't have to change a thing. Simply install, track and save - it's that easy. With Mistbox, you can go green and save green... the best of both worlds!Independent study by IntertekMistbox commissioned Intertek, the largest tester of consumer goods in the world, to quantify Mistbox’s impact. Tests were performed in the same way SEER ratings are certified. Identical temperature and humidity conditions were used (with and without Mistbox) on a 3-Ton, 13 SEER Carrier system. Conditions were set and data was captured by an automated computer system. Results are below:   
We want everyone to be able to take advantage of the savings that Mistbox can offer, regardless of your household budget. That's why we designed Mistbox as a subscription service. We like it because:
 

Also there is no cancellation fee should you ever cancel your service. We're doing our best to make your decision a no brainer!

Mistbox is a universally compatible, connected device that attaches to your existing AC unit in minutes. It uses evaporative cooling to pre-cool the intake air, which makes your AC more efficient. 
How Mistbox Works Cartoon

The resulting efficiency boost means savings of 20-38% on your cooling bills.  Savings are due to two factors, 1) decreased power consumption while the AC is running, and 2) increased capacity in hot conditions which brings really long cycles back down into normal time ranges.

 Worried about installation? Don't be. Mistbox attaches to your AC unit in minutes. In just a few steps, you can hook up Mistbox and start saving money. You don't need any special tools, either. A simple screwdriver will do the trick.  Many customers ask us about water treatment. Mistbox has developed a custom water treatment system to ensure the fine misting can not damage the AC unit. The patent pending method kills bacteria on contact and treats metal surfaces to make algae or mold growth an impossibility. The method also neutralizes dissolved solids (hardness) in the water so they cannot tightly adhere to the condenser fins. The Mistbox filters have been designed to work with municipal water anywhere in the continental US. Take a closer look at our water treatment filter and see for yourself. The Best Of The BestSince water treatment is such an important topic, Mistbox enlisted top water treatment expert Owen Boyd to help us get it right. Owen entered the world of environmental remediation in 1988 and developed a patented technology for the removal of carbon dioxide from combined cycle power plants. He later commercialized this technology for Dow Chemical. Owen's journey in water treatment started in 1992, and he has brought several new technologies to market: 
Developed chelating mercury removal resin to reduce mercury emissions from incinerators and coal burning power plants.
Developed a mercury removal system for dental waste discharge, which is used internationally by thousands of dental clinics. 
In partnership with LeHigh University, developed a regenerable arsenic removable media that is used in many U.S. municipal systems and thousands of U.S. homes.
Developed patent pending system for removal of solids from high TDS water. 
Developed a patent pending process linking ozone with quantum catalyst technology for disinfection of water used in medical applications. 
Needless to say, he knows his stuff. He was also awarded a Technology Innovator Award from the EPA in 1996, among many other accolades and recognition. So you can feel confident that the Mistbox water treatment system is the best of the best.   
 
   We want world peace. And clean air. Neither are easy tasks to undertake, but we decided to focus on clean air. Mistbox started its journey in 2013, with a hairy, audacious goal: take expensive evaporative cooling technology that has been around commercially for decades, and cultivate this into technology that is both impactful and affordable for homeowners (and the planet!). There were lots of unknowns along the way, but we were guided by our passion and overwhelming desire to make a difference.The result is a solution that requires little-to-no effort, while delivering even greater savings than many of the category leaders in our space. It’s a win for consumers. It’s a win for the planet. We are proud to be the engineers, designers, developers and dreamers behind it. Meet Mistbox. And our team of awesome advisors:   Below are some photos of our prototyping stage, as well as some recent pictures of our tools and plastics off them.

<h2>Meet the iGEM Amsterdam 2020 team!</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>All great research projects start with a problem, and biotech faces a big one! <strong>Biotechnological systems</strong> that use modified microbes for production often work well in the lab, but fare poorly in the real world. Why? <strong>Production levels dwindle</strong> because microbial populations evolve to conserve resources for their own growth and do not favour energy expenditure on unnecessary product  synthesis. This results in systems that are <strong>not scalable to industrial standards</strong> with production rates that decrease over time.</p>
<p><strong>We have a solution!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1591120076/mnbu4ietg4hi995pijge.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This years team is <strong>a diverse group of masters students</strong> with a variety of skills and interests, spanning bioinformatics, biomedical research, programming, science, writing and more. We’re <strong>self-motivated</strong> students who want to contribute to science. Together, we form an  interdisciplinary team, working towards one goal: <strong>making biotechnological processes more sustainable!</strong> We will work in the Molecular Microbial Physiology lab at the University of  Amsterdam (UvA) and in close connection with the Faculty of Science from the Vrije University Amsterdam (VU) and the Demonstrator Lab in Amsterdam.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1589874429/ndkxqpujzfl5llqamgbp.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The goal of our project is to design microorganisms to produce a variety of <strong>valuable compounds</strong> in a sustainable way, such as biofuels out of CO2. Nowadays, the production of compounds by microorganisms is often not suitable for a large  scale. This is due to the fact that highly producing microorganisms will eventually be outcompeted by faster-growing, but less productive, individuals. While the production of compounds from these microbes can be environmentally friendly and sometimes even CO2 negative, the problem of <strong>unstable production</strong> withholds companies from using them on a large scale. They then prefer using environmentally unsustainable methods of producing these compounds (i.e. based on fossil fuels). Our solution could <strong>have an enormous impact on the biotech sector</strong> and could provide a new tool in combating CO2 emissions. With this goal in mind, each team member will strive towards realizing this project to their best efforts.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3>Our solution:</h3>
<p>We are identifying points in microbial <strong>metabolic networks</strong> that can be used to couple production to microbial growth. This means that<strong> microbes are encouraged to keep producing</strong> products of interest because it is necessary for their own growth.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, we are modifying the existing FRUITS algorithm, which identifies opportunities for growth-coupled production within the metabolic network of an organism. Traditionally, this algorithm has been limited to metabolic products that are already part of the network, but with our introduction of <strong>“Forbidden FRUITS”</strong> we will expand this tool to allow for the production of non-native products, those that are not naturally made by a host microbe, and are therefore ‘<i>forbidden</i>’. This means that we are <strong>expanding the variety of what we can produce</strong>, independent of which microbe is producing it. Salicylic acid made by <i>E. coli</i>? We are on it.</p>

<h2>Why we need your help &amp; What you get</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The expenses of our wet and dry lab research will be covered entirely by <strong>fundraising and sponsorship</strong>. We cannot do this alone and hope you will help us make our project a reality. Your support will contribute to the efforts made in science and academia to <strong>move towards a more sustainable future</strong>.</p>
<p>Reagents and other wet-lab resources can be <strong>very expensive</strong>, especially those used in genetic engineering. We are being supported by our universities to cover the competition's registration fees and use their facilities; however, we still need your help to bring our project to life as some expenses remain uncovered. The money collected from this campaign will be distributed to cover the following:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Wet-lab reagents and other supplies needed to carry out experiments.</li>
<li>Administrative costs for fundraising strategies.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>As you might have noticed, we need to keep as much of our collected funds as we can. For this reason, as a form of expressing our gratitude if you decide to help us, we are offering you some non-material yet <strong>awesome perks</strong> with which we expect to bring you, and maybe those around you, closer to our project and some of which could give you some exposure as a selfless supporter of science and sustainability.</p>
<p>After all, if you support us you will <strong>become a very important part of this project</strong> too.</p>

<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>With the growing world population, <strong>resources</strong> are getting scarcer by the day and <strong>pollution</strong> is becoming a large problem. In order to be able to keep up with the growing economies and welfare, new production methods have to be found. Microorganisms can play an important role in the production of compounds while <strong>consuming waste such as CO2</strong>. Since 1970, more and more attention is given to the field of microbial engineering for production purposes. Especially in the production of compounds such as biofuels and pharmaceuticals, microorganisms already have their share. However, a major problem with this approach is to <strong>sustain microorganisms in an industrial environment</strong>. Faster-growing, but less productive, individuals eventually win over the efficiently producing microbes. A solution to this problem is to couple product formation to microbial growth: highly producing organisms will also become the fastest-growing ones.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><i><strong>We're following the footsteps of inspiring past teams!</strong></i></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><i>iGEM 2015: [Photo]synthetic Romance: </i></strong></p>
<p>The team focused on providing an alternative to oil by developing a biobased fuel, substituting the unsustainable use of oil with renewable energy produced by coupled organisms. They engineered relationships between bacteria to turn CO2 into useful carbon products.</p>
<p><u>Results :</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Models and simulations to engineer a rationally-designed, proof-of-principle consortium in which a phototroph fixates CO2 to drive, in a genetically stable way, product formation by a chemotroph.</li>
<li>An emulsion-based droplet protocol that can be used to continuously select for the co-culture with the most efficient metabolic relationship.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><i>iGEM 2017: Photosynthetic Magic:</i></strong></p>
<p>CO2 has the potential to be a resource instead of a pollutant. The iGEM Amsterdam 2017 team focussed on converting CO2 to Fumerate using cyanobacteria. This team aimed to stably produce, export and detect fumarate under conditions imitating industrial settings. They were guided by metabolic modelling and tailored to address public concerns and regulatory demands.</p>
<p><u>Results:</u></p>
<ul>
<li>First synthetic photoautotrophic organism capable of converting CO2 directly to fumerate, day and night.</li>
<li>A family of fumarate biosensors capable of quantifying its concentration from 1 up to 20 mM with different dynamic ranges.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>As we all know, the COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact all around the world. The development of projects became unpredictable, ours was not the exception. Luckily, <strong>we have already been able to adapt</strong> to some of the limitations that regulations have imposed.</p>
<p>Our project is special because we can still work on it while we are not able to have full access to the labs in our universities. Right now we are focusing in the development of our algorithm, doing literature research and setting up fundraising campaigns. This means we've been spending most of the time programming and researching <strong>from each of our homes</strong>.</p>
<p>Since  every future plan holds some uncertainty during these times, we are aware that the time to test our results in the lab might not match our expectations. However, this does not mean that we will not be putting our greatest efforts into making it work and bringing it to life. Even if we have to wait to be allowed to go to the lab <strong>we'll be there, with your support, ready to go</strong>.</p>
<p>Also, it is true that in science the expected results are not guaranteed. The success of an experiment cannot be predicted, but even then, <strong>""negative"" results are also valuable</strong> since they provide information that can serve as a reference point to future researchers. In that sense, failure is just an opportunity to  acquire new insights and move forward with  more information. That is why, despite the challenges, we keep working on our project knowing that in the end we will be making a contribution to science.</p>

<h3><strong>The Problem</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src=""""/>Globally, food scraps make up 8 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions according to the U.<strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src=""""/></strong>N. Food and Agriculture Organization(1). If it were a country, food scraps would produce the third most emissions behind only the United States and China. We throw away a lot! Upwards of 40% of the food we grow never makes it to a mouth(2). States like Connecticut recognize this disturbing trend and have enacted legislation to curb it, but more than 350,000 tons of compostable material is still burned every year(3).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549922769/yuuqcluvttzpbmlsb2h0.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src=""""/><strong>Our Solution</strong>
</h3>
<p>Reducing food “waste” is one of the most important things we can do to slow climate change and revitalize the soil we depend on for our food. For five years, we at Blue Earth Compost have been tackling this issue by collecting food scraps from homes, apartments, schools, restaurants, hotels, and grocery stores and hauling it to compost and anaerobic digestion facilities in Connecticut.

<h3><strong>The Project</strong></h3>
<p>In February 2019, we’ll be putting our first custom-made food scrap collection dump truck on the road. This truck will be the first of it’s kind in Connecticut. This is a really big deal and pretty great for a company that started in a garage! We’ll double the amount of food scraps we can collect and it will position Blue Earth Compost as an industry leader. It also means that we can do more for our Hartford community by providing good paying jobs. Presently, half of our workforce are “second-chance” employees and we are committed to offering these opportunities to those who need them most.</p>
<p>The costs associated with the new dump truck are unprecedented investments for our business. To this point, we’ve financed all of our needs in house, but we recognize we’ll need an extra push to get us to where we want to be as a business. When you participate in this funding campaign you help to “push” with us as we grow together.</p>
<p>The Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development (DECD) believes in our business and has helped us to finance the truck. We need your support to help fund the additional costs associated with running the truck so that we quickly meet the capacity and capability of our new wheels.</p>
<p>According to a study by Project Drawdown, ending food “waste” would reduce CO2 emissions nearly as much over the next three decades as onshore wind turbines (5).

<h3>Our Residential Service</h3>
<p>At Blue Earth Compost, we know it feels wrong to throw food in the trash. Once you start composting, you won’t be able to imagine another way. We provide you with the best trash can ever - no waste, no mess, cleaned and relined with compostable bags by us as part of the service.</p>
<p>Blue Earth Compost members receive a 4-gallon pail, lined with a compostable bag, that we pick up once a week or twice a month. During every collection, we exchange your full pail with a clean, relined pail - no clean up required. We handle the messy part and you receive finished compost back three times a year: spring, summer, and fall. Don't want the compost back? We'll make sure it finds a good home.</p>
<h3>Service Territory</h3>
<p><u>Residential</u> - We service: Hartford, West Hartford, East Hartford, Manchester, South Windsor, Windsor, Bloomfield, Canton, Simsbury, Avon, Farmington, Wethersfield, New Britain, Middletown, Glastonbury, and Newington.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Blue Earth Compost has been slowly growing our business over the past five years. We've worked out most the kinks of providing the best quality service we can. However, this campaign will represent a sizable increase in our customer base and as such it might take us a little while to catch up with new demand. Because of this perks may be delivered later than expected and we'll be working as expediently as possible to get them to you.</p>
<p>In addition, adding new residential service territories is challenging and has to be done with in consideration with customer density. Some contributors from new towns may have to wait a little extra time for their route to begin.</p>

</div></div>","The Problem
Globally, food scraps make up 8 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization(1). If it were a country, food scraps would produce the third most emissions behind only the United States and China. We throw away a lot! Upwards of 40% of the food we grow never makes it to a mouth(2). States like Connecticut recognize this disturbing trend and have enacted legislation to curb it, but more than 350,000 tons of compostable material is still burned every year(3).


Our Solution

Reducing food “waste” is one of the most important things we can do to slow climate change and revitalize the soil we depend on for our food. For five years, we at Blue Earth Compost have been tackling this issue by collecting food scraps from homes, apartments, schools, restaurants, hotels, and grocery stores and hauling it to compost and anaerobic digestion facilities in Connecticut. In that time, we’ve diverted over 4.4 million pounds of food scraps. That’s environmentally equivalent to mitigating the emissions of 114,285 gallons of gasoline or keeping 1,120 tons of CO2 out of the atmosphere(4).
We take pride in what we have accomplished so far, but we know that we can take it to another level. We have a plan and you can be a part of it by contributing to our crowdfunding campaign. By doing so you can also get discounted rates on our service as well as swag and finished compost!

Our complex air purifying technology allows you to remove air pollutants, allergens, germs, dust, smoke and unpleasant smells from your environment. With AirZen you will always have a clear mind and the ability to breathe easily.




 








AirZen personal air humidifier for your home and office is the best solution to clear the air in your environment and improve your quality of life. Our warm and cool mist humidifier will make your dreams of a more pleasant environment come true and create a healthy breathing space. AirZen humidifier works within a radius that is just enough to turn your personal space into a favourable microclimate.


AirZen personal air humidifier for your home and office is the best solution to clear the air in your environment and improve your quality of life. Our warm and cool mist humidifier will make your dreams of a more pleasant environment come true and create a healthy breathing space. AirZen humidifier works within a radius that is just enough to turn your personal space into a favourable microclimate.



Air purification is one of the fundamental ways that help us to stay positive all day long. In answer to the growing concern about a comfortable and healthy environment in a world full of airborne toxins and pollutants, we have designed a device that incorporates all of the functions necessary to achieve a clean air environment in everyday use. AirZen HEPA filter air purifier is ideal for users with respiratory conditions, allergy sufferers and people living in contaminated urban areas with growing environmental problems.


AirZen is also an aroma diffuser for essential oils. It has a specifically designed slot for organic essential oils. This allows you to experience personal aromatherapy without interfering with other peoples’ breathing space.



During non-working hours, the ionization mode can be turned on to improve the quality of the environment either manually or automatically.  This freshens the air and significantly reduces airborne pollutants as small as 1 micron, such as allergens, pollen, mould, smoke, pet odours, lingering smells, dust, and other airborne irritants.



Multifunctional AirZendevice 5 in 1 is controlled via a mobile application on your phone. Choose the most desirable option from the provided presets and AirZen will begin its work. A variety of fragrances is available in our app shop section. You can check your air quality by tracking such parameters as: CO2 level, temperature and humidity. AirZen is a technologically advanced air and weather station. However you like your environment, with AirZen, you’re in control!


 




Essential oils are recommended for recreational use, and enhance both mood and clarity of mind. Our 6-Pack collection includes 10ml Eucalyptus, Lavender, Lemon grass, Orange, Peppermint, Tea tree, and more! The oil diffuser is the real deal for your personal environment and social gatherings, providing a calming mood and pleasant memories. You can learn more here about our  essential aroma oils.


 


There are 3 filters in the AirZen: the sponge filter, carbon filter and HEPA. Using filters that meets HEPA standards, the device will begin destroying allergens, bacteria, bad odours, toxic gases and viruses, alleviating asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and poor air quality for everyone. Carbon filtration also helps to reduce odours further and absorbs volatile airborne pollutants.

We recommend changing the filter regularly. When using the device for 2-8 hours a day, the filter will last from 3 to 6 months, depending on the severity of the pollution of the room. The mobile application will inform you when the filter needs to be changed.













Our mission is to help people to live healthy life and to be happy. We are working in the field of climate equipment and want each single product to have high standards of quality.

Thank you to our Indiegogo InDemand backers!    Got 30 seconds? Here's how the HomeBiogas 2.0 appliance can benefit you:     
 
 
 
 
 
New to Biogas? Great! Learning how to make your own renewable energy from food waste is a fascinating and truly rewarding journey. We designed HomeBiogas 2.0 to be super simple and easy to use.  Just toss in your organic waste, and the bacteria will do the rest. Here are the basics of how it works: Leftover food or food scraps may not be suitable for eating, but they still have calories that can be used to create energy. So don't throw them out! Put food waste or animal manure into the appliance. The bacteria in the digester will break down the organic matter and convert it into biogas and fertilizer. The gas bag holds 700 liters of biogas at all times, ready for all your cooking needs. It is a 100% off-the-grid and natural process, similar to what happens in your own stomach.WATCH: The fascinating process in 10 seconds!        COOKING WITH YOUR FOOD WASTEFeed your food waste to HomeBiogas 2.0 and get up to 3 hours of cooking gas daily. It looks, smells, and burns just like any traditional gas would, the only difference is that this gas is made from recycling in your own backyard! HIGH-QUALITY LIQUID FERTILIZERThe other outcome is all high-quality liquid fertilizer. No mess or work needed. The fertilizer flows from the user-friendly pouring sleeve straight into your fertilizer can. You will be proud to nourish your plants and food garden with a natural product, free from harmful chemicals and additives!  TEACH THE YOUNG GENERATION TO RECYCLEHomeBiogas 2.0 enables households to embrace recycling and teach sustainable practices to the young generation. Education and leading by example are the most effective ways of creating new and positive habits. Imagine children growing up knowing that food scraps are not waste, they are valuable!    Choose a location in your backyard for HomeBiogas 2.0. It can be up to 20 meters from the kitchen. Then assemble it by connecting a few parts and filling up the digester with water. Assembly is super easy and should only take an hour! After assembly, activate the appliance the old-fashioned way, using animal manure, or using a bacteria kit. Activation only needs to be done one time, and once activation is done, you will be able to feed HomeBiogas 2.0 with your food scraps and produce free, renewable energy on a daily basis!
    Composting is certainly a good step in the right direction, but with HomeBiogas, you can get more out of your waste. Unsure about why HomeBiogas is the future of waste composting? Let us show you:      Appliance Features:        HomeBiogas 2.0 is a powerful tool that can help mitigate climate change! It is an off-the-grid appliance, meaning that it does not depend on the use of any non-renewable power source. There are several ways in which HomeBiogas 2.0 reduces greenhouse gas emissions.DIVERTS WASTE FROM LANDFILLSLocal waste management with HomeBiogas 2.0 diverts food scraps from becoming landfill waste. When food goes to the landfill, the nutrients in the food never return to the soil. Rather, the wasted food rots and produces methane gas which is released into the atmosphere and contributes to global warming. When you use HomeBiogas 2.0 you will be recycling your food scraps in your own backyard and recycling the methane your food produces.   REDUCES DEPENDENCE ON FOSSIL FUELSWhen you choose to cook on biogas that was made from your food waste, you are reducing the demand for fossil fuels, which are non-renewable resources. Mining, processing and transporting fossil fuels take a lot of energy and resources, which is harmful to the environment and is a leading contributor to climate change. SLOWS DOWN DEFORESTATIONNearly 3 billion people around the world burn wood for daily cooking and heating. Burning wood releases emissions that are contributors to global climate change: carbon dioxide, methane and black carbon. Wood harvesting also contributes to loss of biodiversity and forest degradation. The use of biogas slows down this detrimental deforestation and gives an alternative to cooking on wood or charcoal.     HomeBiogas 2.0 is our second model, the first one, HomeBiogas 1.0, was a huge success! Since its retail sales began in 2016, HomeBiogas 1.0 is used in 76 countries worldwide! Although our customers come from diverse cultures, they share similar goals of wanting to reduce food waste and generate renewable energy. HomeBiogas is a socially oriented company that cares about spreading biogas technology to all.

Cosmic Induction Generator</b></p><p></p><p></p><p>My
name is John Polakowski and I went to school at CalPoly for Computer
Engineering but soon realized that my true interest is with the Electrical
Sciences. You might know me as <b><i>jpolakow</i></b> from Energetic Forum. My
main focus there has been researching the work of Eric Dollard who is a world
renown master of Electricity.  He is the only person alive who has
replicated Tesla's real wireless transmission technologies and has even
improved upon them! </p><p></p>
<p><br/></p><p>I'm
honored because Eric Dollard has taken me under his wing as his
“apprentice"". This relationship has resulted in quite a few amazing
experimental devices that demonstrates many electrical phenomena that defy
conventional theory. You can see a great deal of my work that has been freely
shared for the last few years in the Eric Dollard discussions here: <a href=""http://www.energeticforum.com/eric-dollard-official-forum/11855-eric-dollard.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">John Polakowski Cosmic

<p></p><p>When
Eric Dollard was homeless and needed a place to stay, I invited him into my
home and he stayed there off and on for about a year and a half. During his
stay, we grew to be friends and his genius in the electrical sciences was
instantly apparent. It quickly became my mission to help disseminate his
knowledge of Tesla, advance the science of Electrical Engineering, and recreate
the mind-blowing experimental setups he had formerly done that defy
conventional theories. (As seen in the Borderland videos) </p><p>Here's a screenshot in the video of Eric receiving a radio signal out of the ground at the beach, using a copper screen as a ground plane:</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/494680/files/20140408225218-6.png?1397022738"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Receiver connected to ground plane (in the water)</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/494683/files/20140408225301-5.png?1397022781"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">Before
EPD Labs was founded (Eric's non-profit organization), I was helping him by
publishing his work on Energetic Forum. Eric definitely lives up to his world
renown reputation as a Tesla master and I’m very adept at fabricating
experimental devices from his plans. So, our unique skill sets complement each
other. My primary work with Eric at his lab is focused on actually building the
equipment and that has continued since the time of EPD Labs' inception to the
present day. My abilities to recreate the works of Eric Dollard with actual

<p>One
of the most awe inspiring experiments by Eric Dollard was called the Cosmic
Induction Generator (CIG). So named because the CIG produces intense lines of
dielectric induction that cause a plasma to form which takes on the shape and
form of a galaxy in space (the Cosmic aspect). The aspect that is extraordinary
is the plasma doesn’t take on random shapes or motions- it forms a mini universe!

keep in mind that the Cosmic Induction Generator demonstration is only one of

<p>For
the Cosmic Induction Generator project, I have already designed and built the
Tesla coils, a few HV power supplies, and this includes fabricating custom

something on paper and being able to actually build it. Fortunately, I am quite
capable of both! :)</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/494630/files/20140408222836-01.jpg?1397021316"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/486840/files/20140405201532-02.jpg?1396754132"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/494632/files/20140408222903-03.jpg?1397021343"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/494633/files/20140408222926-04.jpg?1397021366"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/494635/files/20140408222951-05.JPG?1397021391"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The

<p>This
campaign is particularly relevant to the home experimenter or hobbyist. A few
years ago I was an average electrical experimenter who had no idea about Eric
Dollard, or Tesla Coils, or alternative science. Through lots of hard work,

a couple things need to be accomplished:</p>
<p>-Equipment

truck is desperately needed to transport all the equipment from where I live in
San Luis Obispo, Ca to the conference in Idaho. </p>
<p>-I need to take some time off from work so I can visit Eric Dollard at the lab and
prepare our presentations for the conference. </p>
<p>The
conference organizers will be covering travel and lodging expenses during my
trip to the conference.</p>
<p>Any
funds received above our goal will help pay for further improvements and
upgrades to the Cosmic Induction Generator.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/550107/files/20140501140335-am.jpg?1398978215"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>We have acquired two large AM 5000 watt transmitters as you can see above. They're quite a bit bigger than the bench top Navy transmitter I'm currently using for my experiments! One is paid for already and the other we need to pay $3500 for it to be free and clear. When we have 3-phase power hooked up, that is 10,000 watts worth of power we will be able to use to power the largest Cosmic Induction Generator known to man! This will be on a scale that Tesla himself would have built in order to demonstrate these principles. You can see the size of my current coils, which are good up to a couple thousand watts total. The coils that will be built for the monster size demonstration you can imagine will be quite a bit bigger! This will be the largest demonstration ever shown that will demonstrate not only the formative forces on a very large scale, it will be the largest demonstration of synthesizing and de-synthesizing energy right from and into counterspace! </p><p>Furthermore, the electrical flames that are emitted from the capacitor rings around the coil are capable of playing the most high fidelity audio that you have ever heard in your life. Some people play music on their Tesla coils, but that is limited to a small frequency range - the CIG used as an electrical flame plasma speaker is something completely different and not many people have ever witnessed this very rare aspect of this technology.</p><p></p>
<p>Because
of my commitment to the success of the Cosmic Induction Generator project, I
have overextended myself financially by spending money on parts, materials, and
tools. Other aspects of my life have been badly neglected so I am living on
scraps! My truck repairs have been neglected because the success of the Cosmic
Induction Generator is more important - but I do still need my truck! Every extra
bit of money and time is spent working on this project because of  its
profound importance to the advancement of Teslian electrical sciences.</p>
<p>Donating
to this campaign, however large or small, will help to keep the momentum of the
CIG replication moving forward. Even a single dollar makes a difference in my
life! Anything you are able to contribute to this project will be very much
appreciated. Regardless of how much money is raised, I am committed to
finishing the Cosmic Induction Generator. </p><p></p><p>
</p><p>In addition to the unit I will be displaying
at the conference, I am also building a 1 kW version that is ten times as
powerful. This is the unit that will make the amazing plasma displays come to
life! I have already started to build it, and it is coming together great. I’ve
made lots of custom parts for this piece of equipment, I have really put my
heart and soul into making sure everything is perfect! It is powered by two 4-250

<p>Completing
the CIG will bring more awareness to some non-conventional aspects of
electricity that have been forgotten or ignored.  Mainstream science has
become too entrenched in their own paradigm to consider new discoveries, like
living electricity. Change must be brought about on a grassroots level;
presenting equipment that shows physical proof of things not explained by
current science. The CIG is the perfect candidate for this- it has already been
done before! We are recreating something that will bring more attention to the
work of Nikola Tesla and Eric Dollard.</p>
<p>Throughout
my build I’ve already been posting pictures of my progress; so everyone will
get to continue to watch things come together and be a part of the reconstruction
of Eric Dollards famous CIG. I’ve already demonstrated my dedication to this
recreation- I’ve been working on the CIG for over a year now! I am fully able,
motivated, and qualified to complete the CIG if I have the funds to do so!</p>
<p>Some
people have a hard time understanding Eric’s complex technical language. One of
the most important reasons for me to give a presentation at the conference is
that I am able to act as an “interpreter” for Eric. I started out as someone
just like you, so I’m more able to explain complex topics to ordinary people
who have a tough time comprehending Eric’s theories. I can help “translate”
Eric’s comprehensive understanding of electricity into terms the average person
can understand.</p>

<p></p></div>","Who I Am & How I Became Involved With The
Cosmic Induction GeneratorMy
name is John Polakowski and I went to school at CalPoly for Computer
Engineering but soon realized that my true interest is with the Electrical
Sciences. You might know me as jpolakow from Energetic Forum. My
main focus there has been researching the work of Eric Dollard who is a world
renown master of Electricity.  He is the only person alive who has
replicated Tesla's real wireless transmission technologies and has even
improved upon them! 
I'm
honored because Eric Dollard has taken me under his wing as his
“apprentice"". This relationship has resulted in quite a few amazing
experimental devices that demonstrates many electrical phenomena that defy
conventional theory. You can see a great deal of my work that has been freely
shared for the last few years in the Eric Dollard discussions here: John Polakowski Cosmic
Induction Generator
When
Eric Dollard was homeless and needed a place to stay, I invited him into my
home and he stayed there off and on for about a year and a half. During his
stay, we grew to be friends and his genius in the electrical sciences was
instantly apparent. It quickly became my mission to help disseminate his
knowledge of Tesla, advance the science of Electrical Engineering, and recreate
the mind-blowing experimental setups he had formerly done that defy
conventional theories. (As seen in the Borderland videos) Here's a screenshot in the video of Eric receiving a radio signal out of the ground at the beach, using a copper screen as a ground plane:Receiver connected to ground plane (in the water)Before
EPD Labs was founded (Eric's non-profit organization), I was helping him by
publishing his work on Energetic Forum. Eric definitely lives up to his world
renown reputation as a Tesla master and I’m very adept at fabricating
experimental devices from his plans. So, our unique skill sets complement each
other. My primary work with Eric at his lab is focused on actually building the
equipment and that has continued since the time of EPD Labs' inception to the
present day. My abilities to recreate the works of Eric Dollard with actual
working experimental models has already been demonstrated over the years in
Energetic Forum. What Is the Cosmic Induction Generator?
above: Eric with one of the original Cosmic Induction Generators
One
of the most awe inspiring experiments by Eric Dollard was called the Cosmic
Induction Generator (CIG). So named because the CIG produces intense lines of
dielectric induction that cause a plasma to form which takes on the shape and
form of a galaxy in space (the Cosmic aspect). The aspect that is extraordinary
is the plasma doesn’t take on random shapes or motions- it forms a mini universe!
Witnesses to the original experiment described the plasma as being “alive”,
“conscious”, and having a “memory”. 
The
goal of the CIG is to emphasize the living aspect of electricity, as part of
the Formative Forces described by Goethe. Read: Cosmic SuperImposition, Wilhelm Reich This display of the galaxy was termed the “galaxy in a
bulb”, because the plasma formed in a burned out incandescent bulb.
Unfortunately, the “galaxy in a bulb” was never caught on film, but some other
pictures were taken that display interesting effects:Dendritic, root like plasma structure in bulb showing the organic nature of electricity:Interesting plasma formation:Beautiful Golden Ratio Discharge:This one is very mysterious. First notice the organic plasma formation, but also notice the ""figure"" that appears towards the bottom of the picture:Is it an image artifact? Or is it an entity that decided to appear when living electricity is present? Amazing!My Replication Of The Cosmic Induction Generator
Currently,
my singular goal is to recreate the former glory of the CIG, prove electricity
is alive, and catch the “galaxy in a bulb” on film for all to see! 
Please
keep in mind that the Cosmic Induction Generator demonstration is only one of
countless experiments that I will be able to do with these exact same coils and
power supplies - so you any funds donated to this campaign are not just for the
Cosmic Induction Generator, it is for a lot of different experiments that will

dedication, studying, and more hard work, I was able to directly work with Eric
Dollard. I am proof that anyone can do it if they set their mind to it!
How You Can Help Advance The Cosmic Induction Generator Project
The
most immediate goal for funding is to be able to make a demonstration and
presentation at the 2014 Energy Science & Technology Conference. To do this
a couple things need to be accomplished:
-Equipment
is needed to be built that will drive the Tesla Coils with more power at the
conference. Parts and Materials need to be bought. Also some additional tools are required.
-Truck
repairs - my truck died in the middle of the desert on a trip to the lab! The
truck is desperately needed to transport all the equipment from where I live in
San Luis Obispo, Ca to the conference in Idaho. 
-I need to take some time off from work so I can visit Eric Dollard at the lab and
prepare our presentations for the conference. 
The
conference organizers will be covering travel and lodging expenses during my
trip to the conference.
Any
funds received above our goal will help pay for further improvements and
upgrades to the Cosmic Induction Generator.We have acquired two large AM 5000 watt transmitters as you can see above. They're quite a bit bigger than the bench top Navy transmitter I'm currently using for my experiments! One is paid for already and the other we need to pay $3500 for it to be free and clear. When we have 3-phase power hooked up, that is 10,000 watts worth of power we will be able to use to power the largest Cosmic Induction Generator known to man! This will be on a scale that Tesla himself would have built in order to demonstrate these principles. You can see the size of my current coils, which are good up to a couple thousand watts total. The coils that will be built for the monster size demonstration you can imagine will be quite a bit bigger! This will be the largest demonstration ever shown that will demonstrate not only the formative forces on a very large scale, it will be the largest demonstration of synthesizing and de-synthesizing energy right from and into counterspace! Furthermore, the electrical flames that are emitted from the capacitor rings around the coil are capable of playing the most high fidelity audio that you have ever heard in your life. Some people play music on their Tesla coils, but that is limited to a small frequency range - the CIG used as an electrical flame plasma speaker is something completely different and not many people have ever witnessed this very rare aspect of this technology.
Because
of my commitment to the success of the Cosmic Induction Generator project, I
have overextended myself financially by spending money on parts, materials, and

Induction Generator is more important - but I do still need my truck! Every extra
bit of money and time is spent working on this project because of  its
profound importance to the advancement of Teslian electrical sciences.

CIG replication moving forward. Even a single dollar makes a difference in my
life! Anything you are able to contribute to this project will be very much

work of Nikola Tesla and Eric Dollard.
Throughout
my build I’ve already been posting pictures of my progress; so everyone will
get to continue to watch things come together and be a part of the reconstruction
of Eric Dollards famous CIG. I’ve already demonstrated my dedication to this
recreation- I’ve been working on the CIG for over a year now! I am fully able,
motivated, and qualified to complete the CIG if I have the funds to do so!
Some
people have a hard time understanding Eric’s complex technical language. One of
the most important reasons for me to give a presentation at the conference is
that I am able to act as an “interpreter” for Eric. I started out as someone
just like you, so I’m more able to explain complex topics to ordinary people
who have a tough time comprehending Eric’s theories. I can help “translate”
Eric’s comprehensive understanding of electricity into terms the average person
can understand.
By
donating to this cause and helping to realize the finished product, it is proof
that anyone who takes the time and energy can do this!You Should Donate If:- You would like to see a demonstration of the Cosmic Induction Generator at the Energy Science Conference. Even if you can't attend the demonstration will be captured on video.-You would like to see the Cosmic Induction Generator finished, and living, organic, plasma forms be demonstrated- You would like to see Eric Dollard's research continue-You would like to see other designs of Eric Dollard replicated-You think there is phenomena not completely investigated by modern science, and you would like to support its investigation-You would enjoy and feel good about being part of something larger than yourself, that aims to vindicate the work of Nikola TeslaOther Ways You Can HelpOf all people I definitely understand if you are not able to contribute financially, I'm broke myself! There are other ways to help and raise awareness :
Let people you know about the recreation in progress of the Cosmic Induction Generator. Spread the word to make this happen!
Know of a resource I should know about? Let me know!
Follow along on the build, I will be providing updates
Share this campaign on Facebook, Twitter!
Make an intention for this project to succeed!
Thank
you for your consideration in supporting my project!

<h2>Why, What, and How Much?</h2>
<p><i>Did you know that wood windows can be made to be energy efficient and to last far longer than vinyl replacement windows, and it's not more expensive?! </i>Two non-profits and a community college teamed up to offer this program so that more people would be trained in the in-demand specialized skills of rehabilitating and weather-proofing these beautiful old windows. </p>
<p>Why me? Well, think about it: Aesthetic beauty, technical skill and knowledge, fine hand work, customer service... It's all the passions and skills that have made me so happy and successful as a hair stylist. Add in my love for historic homes (from neighborhood skylines to the exposed bones in the basement), and <strong>you can see why this plan makes me smile!</strong> </p>
<p>I'm really looking forward to the new skill, new way to contribute to my community, and additional income stream. </p>
<h3>Course Description</h3>
<p><strong>From Hudson V​alley Community College &amp; Historic Albany Foundation:</strong></p>
<p>The course will provide you with hands-on training in the traditional trade of historic window rehabilitation, including the repair of historic sashes, glazing, frames and weights. You will gain an understanding of fenestration systems used on 19th and 20th century buildings, as well as the basics of the field of historic preservation, weatherization techniques, and where to market your skills.</p>
<p>Students will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan and execute a window rehabilitation project</li>
<li>Understand the repair process through lectures, observation and hands-on repair of wood frame windows in a workshop setting</li>
<li>Gain a broad overview of the history and evolution of windows in America, the materials and construction methods used, and an understanding of typical failures, and the methods used in repairs</li>
</ul>
<h3>Costs:</h3>
<p>I have some money saved up from my hair business that I can put toward getting started. The costs add up, though, which is why I need your help. Here's the break-down for what I can anticipate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Course tuition: $775</li>
<li>Text book: $45</li>
<li>Required tools for course: $90</li>
<li>HEPA shop vac: $500</li>

<p>Existing faucets are stuck in the past.  Until now, we’ve accepted that, because there hasn’t been a better way. Ever been in any of these situations?  We have every day! That's the reason for deciding to reinvent the faucet - there had to be a better way. </p>

<p>Thinking differently about how we use water at home is where real change begins. Faucets alone won’t solve our water crises, but we are proud to contribute to a global, water conscious movement. Nasoni is an official Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) WaterSense partner and has joined the Alliance for Water Efficiency, North America's advocate for water-efficient products.</p>
<p>We are working to inspire all generations to take up the water-saving mantle. The average American uses up to 4.4 gallons of water each time they brush when they leave the water running, and they brush at least twice a day. If all 329 million Americans did that they would use more than a billion gallons of water just brushing alone. And the best part is? You don't even notice that you're saving water because it's simply natural to use a water fountain!  </p>

<p>NASONI’s line of innovative faucets combines the convenience of a water fountain with the contemporary charm of a sophisticated sink fixture. Crafted from premium-grade solid brass, each model provides a level of durability that will stand the test of time. Ultra-exclusive PVD coatings prevent tarnish and corrosion and ensure that your faucet will always remain just as lustrous as the day it was installed.   </p>

<p>A revolutionary new concept in the world of sink fixtures, Nasoni Fountain Faucets utilize a dual method of water delivery. For starters, you’ll still be able to get water from the downspout as you would with a traditional faucet.</p>
<p>But with a flip of a switch, the flow can be redirected through a spout at the top of the faucet, bringing you a magnificent arc of pure, clean water whenever you want. It’s like having a water fountain right in the comfort of your home!  And just like that, your mornings begin to sound a whole lot better.  </p>

<p>Nasoni's award-winning, patented fountain faucets were designed and engineered in the US, and manufactured in Asia at our ISO 9001 certified factory that also makes bath products for IKEA, Franke, and other prestigious companies.  We then brought them back to the US to IAPMO R&amp;T in Ontario, California, the leading certification agency in North America, where they were certified to meet or exceed all applicable US and Canadian standards. </p>

<p>PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) uses a state-of-the-art process that molecularly bonds the finish to the faucet, creating a super-hard surface that is by far the most durable available today. Products with a PVD finish will not corrode, discolor, or tarnish. Of all coating processes, PVD is the most environmentally benign. The PVD process does not create any of the hazardous waste associated with other types of coatings (e.g. electroplating or painting). PVD coatings also contribute to the longer life of products, which has positive benefits to many aspects of the environment, such as reduced landfill volume.</p>

A matching PVD finished pop-up drain is included. </p>

<p>Besides our eternal gratitude, we’ll assemble a NASONI Faucet Fountain with great care and send it to you along with an installation manual.  With the centerset faucet you can unbox it, install it, use it right away - it’s as quick and as simple as that. With a widespread faucet, although it can be a DIY project, we recommend a plumber.  </p>

<p>Not all faucet types work with every sink, so it's important to make sure the faucet you choose will fit your sink or basin. The Da Vinci line of fountain faucets by Nasoni is currently both centerset and widespread types. Centerset faucets are made for basins with three holes and have handles that are 4 inches apart. They combine a spout and handles on a single base unit.  The widespread faucet is for three-hole basins. They have three separate pieces — two handles and a spout — and the spacing between the handles is 8 inches.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: Please do not purchase if you have a wall-mounted, single-hole, or taller vessel faucet meant to complement a vessel sink that sits above the countertop, as they will not work with Nasoni Fountain Faucets. </strong></p>

<p>Ever bought a faucet from a big box retail store, only to have it leak within a few years? Faucet manufacturers all sell exclusive models to the big-box stores with plastic internals/drain assemblies. Big-box stores offer low prices in order to attract customers, and in order to hit the low prices these retailers want, suppliers need to cut costs on the product. But you won’t know that until you take them apart. Cheap prices = cheap components and inferior faucets as a result.</p>
<p>Nasoni only manufactures only high-quality faucets with full brass internals, you can feel the difference when you pick it up. Notice the difference below when the downspouts are removed.  </p>

<p>We have been working on perfecting Da Vinci Fountain Faucets for more than 5 years and we have developed numerous iterations, 3D printed models, and production prototypes. Along the way, we adopted existing, proven technologies using certified components in new ways to guarantee performance and to create our Dynamic Fountain Flow™ technology. The result is a patent-pending breakthrough in an industry that has fostered remarkably little innovation in well over a century. NASONI's new faucets are packed full of patented features and meticulously engineered in the US. They are designed from the ground up to be the best faucets on the planet. </p>

<p>Nasoni is committed to being a “green” company, through the nature of our work, the way we pursue it, and our products.</p>
<p>Unlike cheap Big Box retail faucets that are typically made of zinc and plastic parts that fail over a short period of time, Da Vinci Fountain Faucets are made of the highest quality materials and backed by a Limited Lifetime Warranty for the original purchaser.</p>
<p>For our faucets, Nasoni has chosen to use a PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) finish; of all coating processes, it is the most environmentally benign. The PVD process does not create any of the hazardous waste associated with other types of coating such as electroplating or painting. PVD coatings, in and of themselves enhance environmental protection. PVD coatings also contribute to the longer life of products, which has positive benefits to many aspects of the environment, such as reduced landfill volume.</p>

<p>Da Vinci fountain faucets are designed for longevity, as they are made of solid, lead-free brass. Brass is prized for faucets because it is very resistant to corrosion, has a relatively low melting point — making it easy to cast — is soft enough to machine with little effort yet hardy enough to endure the rigors of life as a faucet, takes finishes such as PVD coatings very well, and is easily recycled. About 80% of the brass used in new faucets was previously used to make something else.</p>
<p>The packaging is recyclable, as the packaging is made from recyclable materials, including EPE foam. Expanded polyethylene (EPE) is an environmentally safe, non-toxic foaming material that can be recycled and helps to reduce environmental pollution.</p>

<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s WaterSense program specification for bathroom sink faucets allows a maximum flow rate of no more than 1.5 GPM for bathroom faucets, 32% below the industry standard of 2.2 GPM. Da Vinci faucets are below that, as they are California Energy Commission (CEC) compliant at 1.2gpm for additional water savings. However, when in fountain mode, these faucets become the highest water-saving faucets on the planet, as the flow rate is reduced to .26gpm, yet still providing the perfect flow rate for the many uses a water fountain in the bathroom can provide!</p>

</div></div>","Existing faucets are stuck in the past.  Until now, we’ve accepted that, because there hasn’t been a better way. Ever been in any of these situations?  We have every day! That's the reason for deciding to reinvent the faucet - there had to be a better way. 
 
     
At NASONI, we created a faucet that leaves you feeling clean, refreshed, and ready to meet what’s next.  We promise your first experience with your Da Vinci will be a lasting one.  









 
Our #1 priority here at Nasoni is your happiness. We stand by our faucets 100%, no matter what, no questions asked, no holds barred, no ifs, no ands, no buts. If you are not completely delighted with your Nasoni fountain faucet in the first 30 days, we will resolve any issue.  Refund it. Send a new fountain faucet.  Whatever it takes.  Just contact our Customer Service team. And after these first 30 days, your faucet comes with a Limited Lifetime Warranty. Happiness guaranteed.
 
WHICH FAUCET DO YOU NEED? CENTERSET VS WIDESPREAD

Check your bathroom to determine if you need the 4"" Centerset (left) or 8"" Widespread (right)


PLEASE NOTE: WE ONLY HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF FAUCETS AVAILABLE FOR IMMEDIATE SHIPPING, WHEN THEY SELL OUT THE NEXT BACKERS WILL HAVE TO WAIT 3 MONTHS FOR THE NEXT PRODUCTION RUN.  WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND BACKING NOW AND GET YOURS BY THE DECEMBER HOLIDAYS!




 
 

Thinking differently about how we use water at home is where real change begins. Faucets alone won’t solve our water crises, but we are proud to contribute to a global, water conscious movement. Nasoni is an official Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) WaterSense partner and has joined the Alliance for Water Efficiency, North America's advocate for water-efficient products.
We are working to inspire all generations to take up the water-saving mantle. The average American uses up to 4.4 gallons of water each time they brush when they leave the water running, and they brush at least twice a day. If all 329 million Americans did that they would use more than a billion gallons of water just brushing alone. And the best part is? You don't even notice that you're saving water because it's simply natural to use a water fountain!  

Nasoni is an official WaterSense partner and a member of the Alliance for Water Efficiency. WaterSense and its partners are committed to bringing water-efficient products to market, labeling new homes, and spreading the word about the need for smart water use. 


Stately. Handsome. Inspiring. Terms befitting of a faucet that is unlike any other you’ve ever experienced before. The sleek design and contoured lines complement an extraordinary basin fixture that serves as a testament to great taste and commands attention in any room.
   
NASONI’s line of innovative faucets combines the convenience of a water fountain with the contemporary charm of a sophisticated sink fixture. Crafted from premium-grade solid brass, each model provides a level of durability that will stand the test of time. Ultra-exclusive PVD coatings prevent tarnish and corrosion and ensure that your faucet will always remain just as lustrous as the day it was installed.   

A revolutionary new concept in the world of sink fixtures, Nasoni Fountain Faucets utilize a dual method of water delivery. For starters, you’ll still be able to get water from the downspout as you would with a traditional faucet.
But with a flip of a switch, the flow can be redirected through a spout at the top of the faucet, bringing you a magnificent arc of pure, clean water whenever you want. It’s like having a water fountain right in the comfort of your home!  And just like that, your mornings begin to sound a whole lot better.  
   



 
At Nasoni, we understand that not all city water is equal. That's why we created the Nasoni under-counter filter. It's NSF 42 & 53 certified and made in America. It comes with everything you need for a typical installation in your vanity, including 20"" braided stainless steel cold water connecting lines. And, no more bottled water to buy!  
Simply add $129 to any reward level to add a Nasoni under counter water filter to your reward. 



Nasoni's award-winning, patented fountain faucets were designed and engineered in the US, and manufactured in Asia at our ISO 9001 certified factory that also makes bath products for IKEA, Franke, and other prestigious companies.  We then brought them back to the US to IAPMO R&T in Ontario, California, the leading certification agency in North America, where they were certified to meet or exceed all applicable US and Canadian standards. 

 

Unlike all other Kickstarter projects, our faucets are already designed, engineered, certified, and manufactured and are ready for YOU!  We have removed the risk. We need you, the Kickstarter community, to help us get the word out about how great they are. 
We selected our factory partner with great care. The factory used by Nasoni was selected to ensure safe, responsible working conditions, and the highest quality standards. Our factory meets and exceeds all environmental production standards, and is ISO 9001 certified.  Below are images of YOUR faucets actually being made! You are getting the opportunity to be the very first to own one. 


These are real, lead-free cast brass faucets! They weigh about 6 lbs and are engineered to last a lifetime. Here we show what it's like pouring the lead-free brass into the mold to create our brass casting. 


PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) uses a state-of-the-art process that molecularly bonds the finish to the faucet, creating a super-hard surface that is by far the most durable available today. Products with a PVD finish will not corrode, discolor, or tarnish. Of all coating processes, PVD is the most environmentally benign. The PVD process does not create any of the hazardous waste associated with other types of coatings (e.g. electroplating or painting). PVD coatings also contribute to the longer life of products, which has positive benefits to many aspects of the environment, such as reduced landfill volume.


Each of our faucets is assembled by hand at our ISO-9001 certified factory. Starting with good old-fashioned craftsmanship featuring solid brass construction, we add state-of-the-art ¼ turn ceramic disc valves with limited lifetime warranties and quality controls that meet or exceed government codes, including national and local lead-free and rigorous California water conservation standards. A matching PVD finished pop-up drain is included. 





We are offering Da Vinci Fountain Faucets to the Kickstarter community at discount rates that will never be offered again.  Why?  Because our goal is to get them into the hands of innovators and early adopters like you that will help us spread the word on how awesome these faucets are, which in turn will help us reach a larger market. Win-win!








Want to feel like you have renovated your bathroom but don't have the time nor budget for a major redo? Faucets are the crown jewels of the bathroom, simply replace your old faucet with a Da Vinci Fountain Faucet and it will feel like a full renovation! 


Stately. Handsome. Inspiring. Terms befitting of a faucet that is unlike any other you’ve ever experienced before. The sleek design and contoured lines complement an extraordinary basin fixture that serves as a testament to great taste and commands attention in any room.
NASONI’s line of innovative faucets combines the convenience of a water fountain with the contemporary charm of a sophisticated sink fixture. Crafted from premium-grade solid brass, each model provides a level of durability that will stand the test of time. Ultra-exclusive PVD coatings prevent tarnish and corrosion and ensure that your faucet will always remain just as lustrous as the day it was installed.
Silky-smooth operation and drip-free performance are achieved by the included ceramic disc valve system, heralded for its ability to outperform and outlast other types of faucet mechanisms. Every component used in the manufacturing of our products meets or exceeds industry standards and was selected to provide years of uncompromised service.


The pièce de résistance of the Da Vinci family of premium fountain faucets, this fixture exudes an air of distinction and elegance that one would expect from more expensive models. First glances become lasting impressions for anyone that allows their senses to be pampered by both the streamlined aesthetics and world-class performance of a faucet that is light years ahead of the curve.


Besides our eternal gratitude, we’ll assemble a NASONI Faucet Fountain with great care and send it to you along with an installation manual.  With the centerset faucet you can unbox it, install it, use it right away - it’s as quick and as simple as that. With a widespread faucet, although it can be a DIY project, we recommend a plumber.  


Nasoni's revolutionary, award-winning fountain faucets are Patented and Trademarked in the US and China, the additional US and Foreign patents pending. We're the only ones that can do this! And that's a good thing because we're doing it right.


Not all faucet types work with every sink, so it's important to make sure the faucet you choose will fit your sink or basin. The Da Vinci line of fountain faucets by Nasoni is currently both centerset and widespread types. Centerset faucets are made for basins with three holes and have handles that are 4 inches apart. They combine a spout and handles on a single base unit.  The widespread faucet is for three-hole basins. They have three separate pieces — two handles and a spout — and the spacing between the handles is 8 inches.
NOTE: Please do not purchase if you have a wall-mounted, single-hole, or taller vessel faucet meant to complement a vessel sink that sits above the countertop, as they will not work with Nasoni Fountain Faucets. 

Ever bought a faucet from a big box retail store, only to have it leak within a few years? Faucet manufacturers all sell exclusive models to the big-box stores with plastic internals/drain assemblies. Big-box stores offer low prices in order to attract customers, and in order to hit the low prices these retailers want, suppliers need to cut costs on the product. But you won’t know that until you take them apart. Cheap prices = cheap components and inferior faucets as a result.
Nasoni only manufactures only high-quality faucets with full brass internals, you can feel the difference when you pick it up. Notice the difference below when the downspouts are removed.  




The use of the fountain feature of the fountain faucet is much safer than the use of the non-disposable cup when both are exposed to the aerosol effect.
The fountain feature of the fountain faucet can remove bacteria from tap water caused by the aerosol effect.
The fountain feature of the fountain faucet can remove 88 MPN/100 ml - 866 MPN/100 ml of E.coli after the fountain feature of the fountain faucet was kept open for 10 seconds.
The fountain feature of the fountain faucet has a lower risk of contracting bacteria from bioaerosols as compared with the non-disposable cup due to the smaller size of the fountain nozzle (opening) when compared to the diameter of a cup.



We have been working on perfecting Da Vinci Fountain Faucets for more than 5 years and we have developed numerous iterations, 3D printed models, and production prototypes. Along the way, we adopted existing, proven technologies using certified components in new ways to guarantee performance and to create our Dynamic Fountain Flow™ technology. The result is a patent-pending breakthrough in an industry that has fostered remarkably little innovation in well over a century. NASONI's new faucets are packed full of patented features and meticulously engineered in the US. They are designed from the ground up to be the best faucets on the planet. 


   
    

Lucky for our backers, our fountain faucets are proven already through a production pilot, and the first production order has been delivered to our warehouse and is ready for you!
We first 3D printed our CAD models until we got the design just right, and then we built numerous production quality prototypes and installed them in our homes to test and ensure perfect functionality. And now we're ready for you to help us get them out and in use to show the world how much better life can be with a fountain faucet. 



Nasoni is committed to being a “green” company, through the nature of our work, the way we pursue it, and our products.
Unlike cheap Big Box retail faucets that are typically made of zinc and plastic parts that fail over a short period of time, Da Vinci Fountain Faucets are made of the highest quality materials and backed by a Limited Lifetime Warranty for the original purchaser.
For our faucets, Nasoni has chosen to use a PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) finish; of all coating processes, it is the most environmentally benign. The PVD process does not create any of the hazardous waste associated with other types of coating such as electroplating or painting. PVD coatings, in and of themselves enhance environmental protection. PVD coatings also contribute to the longer life of products, which has positive benefits to many aspects of the environment, such as reduced landfill volume.
Nasoni is committed to environmental stewardship. We recognize the necessity for the highest possible environmental sensitivity in all of our work.


Da Vinci fountain faucets are designed for longevity, as they are made of solid, lead-free brass. Brass is prized for faucets because it is very resistant to corrosion, has a relatively low melting point — making it easy to cast — is soft enough to machine with little effort yet hardy enough to endure the rigors of life as a faucet, takes finishes such as PVD coatings very well, and is easily recycled. About 80% of the brass used in new faucets was previously used to make something else.
The packaging is recyclable, as the packaging is made from recyclable materials, including EPE foam. Expanded polyethylene (EPE) is an environmentally safe, non-toxic foaming material that can be recycled and helps to reduce environmental pollution.


The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s WaterSense program specification for bathroom sink faucets allows a maximum flow rate of no more than 1.5 GPM for bathroom faucets, 32% below the industry standard of 2.2 GPM. Da Vinci faucets are below that, as they are California Energy Commission (CEC) compliant at 1.2gpm for additional water savings. However, when in fountain mode, these faucets become the highest water-saving faucets on the planet, as the flow rate is reduced to .26gpm, yet still providing the perfect flow rate for the many uses a water fountain in the bathroom can provide!


Our factory is ISO 9001 certified and follows green practices in providing products for other companies such as IKEA, Franke, and others.
Our factory specializes in PVD coatings. The PVD process is more environmentally friendly than alternatives such as electroplating and painting. Unlike these there are no gases, water waste and other residue released.


Fulfillment and distribution is handled by our partner, Fulfilltopia out of Norfolk, VA. Fulfilltopia recently switched from bubble wrap to an eco-friendly high-tech honeycomb paper packing product called Geami. Gemini is all-natural, 100% recyclable, renewable and biodegradable, and consists of either entirely or partially recycled content. Geami also helps to reduce packing time and materials, resulting in significant cost savings. Fufilltopia also has numerous other energy savings initiatives underway to reduce energy consumption.


6 GREEN CERTIFICATIONS: Our faucets have achieved 6 green certifications from IAPMO R&T. This is also the greenest faucet ever made in terms of water savings. The reason? When the downward flow of water is shut off and the water fountain created through our patented Dynamic Fountain Flow technology, the flow rate is reduced from 2.2gpm (normal faucet) down to .26gpm, an 88% reduction!",92.0,3,"1 Campaign

Being an Airbnb host is an amazing experience. It allows you to meet incredible people from all over the world, and it’s great fun. But it’s also a business, so I am always looking for ways to improve my service and maximize my revenue. It’s not easy—what most people don't realize is that you have lots of background costs: there are cleaning fees, maintenance costs, mortgage payments, house taxes, water and electricity bills. I left the electricity bill for last but, in reality, it should be the first one, because unlike other costs it can be reduced and is therefore not fixed. But most hosts don't know where to start when it comes to power saving. What compounds the problem is the lack of straightforward resources, targeted towards such hosts, showing them how to do it. <br/><br/>According to a recent US study conducted by energy.gov, heating and cooling contributes to as much as 48% of the total energy consumption for homes. In EU households it is even higher at a whopping 73%. And in many cases, it can reach up to 90% for vacation rentals and hotels—this is because guests are not accountable for electricity usage so they tend to abuse their position and keep ACs running all day long. Most energy-saving techniques employed by commercial air conditioners perform poorly. </p><p>What motivated me to start this project is that in January 2015 one of my apartments received a whopping $1200 electricity bill, cancelling out all my revenue for that particular apartment for the previous 3 months.  I simply couldn’t believe it and I had to do something about it fast or my business would’ve suffered immensely.<br/><br/>That's when the idea for the Xia energy-saving device started. The device is named after my 5 year old daughter and in Greek means ‘showing hospitality to foreigners’. That was perfect for the device, because I wanted it to have no effect on my guests’ comfort while it saved me some money.<br/><br/>So before starting working on the device I set myself two challenges: the device had to show unprecedented levels of power saving without affecting user comfort.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506938727/cevpl0tha1lwjvobzy1j.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/>The device we finally created has two parts: the first is a door sensor that detects when guests leave the apartment and the second is a ceiling-mounted device that senses whether or not there are any guests still inside. If no one is present in the room for 15 minutes, it then sends an IR signal to turn the AC off. This maintains guest comfort in that the AC is only turned off when there is no one inside and it maximizes energy savings by making sure the AC is only turned on when it’s needed!<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506939885/ganxiwzq56q1hfmmnaiu.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The device is also simple to setup and 100% wireless, without the need to connect to mains electricity or even interface with the AC physically. It’s also battery powered and uses advanced battery management features to sleep and wakeup in a calculated manner in order to prolong battery life. It's different from the usual systems present in hotels in that it makes sure guests are outside the room before shutting down and it also cannot be manipulated by guests like key cards can. </p><p>After over two years of prototyping and testing we now have a 100% working version ready for production. This version has been successfully installed in my apartments and I have seen incredible savings of as much as 70% for apartments that have reached the top electricity tier. </p><p>Now we need your help to take it into production and make it a reality for so many people.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p><p>Part of the gathered funds will be put into quality assurance and mass production to allow people to get the Xia energy-saving device at the lowest price possible. The second part is to help us to open an office and hire support and sales personnel in order to expand our business. Extra funds over our target will go towards making Xia smarter by integrating it with mobile phones and researching our next step of making it an all-in-one home security device with smoke and CO2 detectors, intruder alarms, and a security camera.<br/><br/>Our perks vary but we follow one rule: the sooner you pledge, the better the deal you get on your own Xia! The best value perks are only available for a limited time, so check out the rewards bar down the side and grab a great deal while you can.</p><p>Standard enclosures consist of a plastic case similar in style to smoke detectors, which makes them more discreet. If you prefer a more modern, stylish design you can upgrade to the polished aluminum case. Aluminum cases are far more expensive to manufacture and are RoHS compliant so they do come at a premium. We decided to offer two options so as to suit any budget, but functionally they work the same way. The one advantage of the aluminum design, beyond style preferences, is that it has more space for possible future expansions, as we are planning to develop functions like smart phone control and security system upgrades.</p><p>For users of ACs that don’t have IR control (a few don’t but the majority do) we are offering a wireless relay module to help them install Xia easily.</p><p>If we do not reach our goal we will still use the funds to send products to pledgers as they will be enough to micro-produce the devices, but we won't be able to open an office or hire staff and will need to come up with different strategy for that.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529792120/knnmz0xqmezealysz6ki.jpg"" src=""""/><br/> </p><p><strong>The Impact</strong><br/>The device is perfect if you are a vacation rental host, a hotel or home owner, especially if you have kids in the house that carelessly leave the AC on for extended durations. I invented the device to help me save on my electricity bills and it has allowed me to increase my Airbnb hosting revenues overnight. My electricity bill was cut by half most months saving me thousands of dollars a year. </p><p>Hotels systems that rely on key cards can be easily tricked and manipulated by leaving a spare card inserted all day to keep the AC on.</p><p>Other devices need to be physically connected to ACs or HVACs by digging into cabling or even more dangerously tapping into circuit breakers. Other systems also require connections and cabling to the ceiling in order to power the device. The Xia energy-saving device on the other hand uses batteries that last for 1 year but can also be connected to power if connections are already in place.</p><p>Xia was tested successfully on many type of units from various AC manufacturers including but not limited to:<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507018327/zdlenqcd0gjp9wlu0lfi.jpg"" src=""""/><br/> </p><p><strong>Better Than Solar:</strong><br/>Our device is 500% more energy efficient than installing solar panels to lower electricity bills and cost 1/30<sup>th</sup> of the price. As most experts know, the biggest savings come from managing usage more than anything else and solar systems don't take that into consideration.

Being an Airbnb host is an amazing experience. It allows you to meet incredible people from all over the world, and it’s great fun. But it’s also a business, so I am always looking for ways to improve my service and maximize my revenue. It’s not easy—what most people don't realize is that you have lots of background costs: there are cleaning fees, maintenance costs, mortgage payments, house taxes, water and electricity bills. I left the electricity bill for last but, in reality, it should be the first one, because unlike other costs it can be reduced and is therefore not fixed. But most hosts don't know where to start when it comes to power saving. What compounds the problem is the lack of straightforward resources, targeted towards such hosts, showing them how to do it. According to a recent US study conducted by energy.gov, heating and cooling contributes to as much as 48% of the total energy consumption for homes. In EU households it is even higher at a whopping 73%. And in many cases, it can reach up to 90% for vacation rentals and hotels—this is because guests are not accountable for electricity usage so they tend to abuse their position and keep ACs running all day long. Most energy-saving techniques employed by commercial air conditioners perform poorly. What motivated me to start this project is that in January 2015 one of my apartments received a whopping $1200 electricity bill, cancelling out all my revenue for that particular apartment for the previous 3 months.  I simply couldn’t believe it and I had to do something about it fast or my business would’ve suffered immensely.That's when the idea for the Xia energy-saving device started. The device is named after my 5 year old daughter and in Greek means ‘showing hospitality to foreigners’. That was perfect for the device, because I wanted it to have no effect on my guests’ comfort while it saved me some money.So before starting working on the device I set myself two challenges: the device had to show unprecedented levels of power saving without affecting user comfort.The device we finally created has two parts: the first is a door sensor that detects when guests leave the apartment and the second is a ceiling-mounted device that senses whether or not there are any guests still inside. If no one is present in the room for 15 minutes, it then sends an IR signal to turn the AC off. This maintains guest comfort in that the AC is only turned off when there is no one inside and it maximizes energy savings by making sure the AC is only turned on when it’s needed!The device is also simple to setup and 100% wireless, without the need to connect to mains electricity or even interface with the AC physically. It’s also battery powered and uses advanced battery management features to sleep and wakeup in a calculated manner in order to prolong battery life. It's different from the usual systems present in hotels in that it makes sure guests are outside the room before shutting down and it also cannot be manipulated by guests like key cards can. After over two years of prototyping and testing we now have a 100% working version ready for production. This version has been successfully installed in my apartments and I have seen incredible savings of as much as 70% for apartments that have reached the top electricity tier. Now we need your help to take it into production and make it a reality for so many people. What We Need & What You GetPart of the gathered funds will be put into quality assurance and mass production to allow people to get the Xia energy-saving device at the lowest price possible. The second part is to help us to open an office and hire support and sales personnel in order to expand our business. Extra funds over our target will go towards making Xia smarter by integrating it with mobile phones and researching our next step of making it an all-in-one home security device with smoke and CO2 detectors, intruder alarms, and a security camera.Our perks vary but we follow one rule: the sooner you pledge, the better the deal you get on your own Xia! The best value perks are only available for a limited time, so check out the rewards bar down the side and grab a great deal while you can.Standard enclosures consist of a plastic case similar in style to smoke detectors, which makes them more discreet. If you prefer a more modern, stylish design you can upgrade to the polished aluminum case. Aluminum cases are far more expensive to manufacture and are RoHS compliant so they do come at a premium. We decided to offer two options so as to suit any budget, but functionally they work the same way. The one advantage of the aluminum design, beyond style preferences, is that it has more space for possible future expansions, as we are planning to develop functions like smart phone control and security system upgrades.For users of ACs that don’t have IR control (a few don’t but the majority do) we are offering a wireless relay module to help them install Xia easily.If we do not reach our goal we will still use the funds to send products to pledgers as they will be enough to micro-produce the devices, but we won't be able to open an office or hire staff and will need to come up with different strategy for that. The ImpactThe device is perfect if you are a vacation rental host, a hotel or home owner, especially if you have kids in the house that carelessly leave the AC on for extended durations. I invented the device to help me save on my electricity bills and it has allowed me to increase my Airbnb hosting revenues overnight. My electricity bill was cut by half most months saving me thousands of dollars a year. Hotels systems that rely on key cards can be easily tricked and manipulated by leaving a spare card inserted all day to keep the AC on.Other devices need to be physically connected to ACs or HVACs by digging into cabling or even more dangerously tapping into circuit breakers. Other systems also require connections and cabling to the ceiling in order to power the device. The Xia energy-saving device on the other hand uses batteries that last for 1 year but can also be connected to power if connections are already in place.Xia was tested successfully on many type of units from various AC manufacturers including but not limited to: Better Than Solar:Our device is 500% more energy efficient than installing solar panels to lower electricity bills and cost 1/30th of the price. As most experts know, the biggest savings come from managing usage more than anything else and solar systems don't take that into consideration. The best savings come from careful usage and not generating more electricity while wasting just as much. Power generation should always be the second step after energy-saving methods.Device Features:       Save 30-70% on your energy bill       Achieve Return On Investment (ROI) in as little as 1 month       Battery Powered - Lasts for more than a year       100% Wireless - No wiring needed       Easy Configuration & SetupHow It Works:Xia intelligently knows when guests leave the room and only then does it turn the AC off.
