<h3>Hello my name is Cindy and I am a single mom of four children recently diagnosed with lung cancer.</h3>
<p> This past year has been a very hard difficult year for my children and I . It started a year ago when their father, my husband moved us to Florida for a better life, he was offered a job making good money. We left our hometown, our friends, and our home. within three months of being there he up and left us and moved out of state. The children have not seen him since. He was head of the household financially and when he left a lot of devastating things happened to us. We were evicted, stayed in a hotel, stayed in a friends home, we tried renting an apartment but on my salary working full time gone all day and most of the night it didn't make the bills and rent.We didn't know anyone down there and the children were depressed and very angry. I made a decision to move back to NY to be with friends and family, So that my children would feel more secure while I was at work and not at home. They needed to be around people who loved them and would be there for them. We came back four months ago and are staying with an old  friend. in the process we  lost everything we had, including their beds. We could not afford a uhaul to move everything back. The only thing we brought with us was our clothes and keepsakes. Two months into staying with my friend almost a year to the day that their father left I found out I had stage three lung cancer . I was having terrible joint pains, so bad I could not walk, my blood pressure was spiraling out of control, and went to the ER where tests concluded that I had Cancer. I cannot work , and in pain all the time, going through chemo and radiation now and my children are scared, they have lost so much already. I need help to get back on my feet and a place my children can call home. I need to get them beds and make sure they are secure. I want to be able to help my children feel safe again. They are scared and I don't want my Cancer to stop me from doing for them. But I cannot work right now and i need help to raise money to help me get us back on our feet again. Pay off some bills and start fresh. They should not have to pay for what their father did and what I have been diagnosed with. Please find it within your hearts to please help us get back on our feet, It is so hard being a single mom, but so much harder when your sick all the time and fighting for your life. </p>

<p>But I can’t go without your help! </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This unique training program is lead by two inspiring teachers:

Jovinna and Grace, will be guiding me, and 24 other female yoga teachers from
around the world, on an empowering, transformative journey.  Over the course of the month, we will be
diving head first into yogic philosophy, the divine feminine, we will study goddesses from
religions and communities all over the world, experience the nourishment and
strength of daily yoga practice, and learn tools to integrate all that we learn
and channel it into our teaching. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I am currently teaching 12 classes a week, working with a
number of private clients and at two different studios in the Boston area.  Participating in Shakti Initiation will not
only deepen my personal practice but also greatly enhance what I offer my
students, bringing my career as a yoga teacher to the next level.</span></p>
<p><b>YOUR DONATION WILL
MAKE A DIFFERENCE!</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The practice of yoga and meditation is a powerful tool for healing
past trauma, and building inner strength.  Unfortunately, classes in this field are not
widely accessible and are often avoided, seen as a luxury rather than a
necessity.  Upon my return from training,
I will donate 100hrs of my time (and hopefully more!) to the YWCA in Central Square, where I will offer
free weekly yoga and meditation classes for women who have lived, or are currently
living, in domestic abuse environments.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">My hope is that through these classes, I will be able to
offer these women healthy and safe tools to manage stress, cultivate self-love,
shed the weight of the past and step forward into a life of wholeness and
happiness. </span></p>
<p><b>WHERE <i>EXACTLY</i> IS THE MONEY GOING? </b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The tuition for the program is $4,200.  If I reach my goal, the extra $1,000 will go
towards the cost of flights, traveler’s health insurance and a temporary visa. </span></p>

only deepen my personal practice but also greatly enhance what I offer my
students, bringing my career as a yoga teacher to the next level.
YOUR DONATION WILL
MAKE A DIFFERENCE!
The practice of yoga and meditation is a powerful tool for healing
past trauma, and building inner strength.  Unfortunately, classes in this field are not
widely accessible and are often avoided, seen as a luxury rather than a
necessity.  Upon my return from training,
I will donate 100hrs of my time (and hopefully more!) to the YWCA in Central Square, where I will offer
free weekly yoga and meditation classes for women who have lived, or are currently
living, in domestic abuse environments.  
My hope is that through these classes, I will be able to
offer these women healthy and safe tools to manage stress, cultivate self-love,
shed the weight of the past and step forward into a life of wholeness and
happiness. 
WHERE EXACTLY IS THE MONEY GOING? 
The tuition for the program is $4,200.  If I reach my goal, the extra $1,000 will go
towards the cost of flights, traveler’s health insurance and a temporary visa.

<h3>Meet Lane!</h3>
<p>Meet our son, Lane!  He is our earth angel.  Lane was diagnosed with 18p deletion syndrome when he was just 18 months old.  He is an amazing little boy.  We learned early that he wasn't going to follow the rules.  He stayed in the hospital for almost a week after he was born, because he wouldn't eat.  At 4 months old, he had his first brain MRI, when the pediatric ophthalmologist noticed he had a partial paralysis of his eye muscles.  He got his first pair of eye glasses the next week (and he still can be stubborn when it comes to wearing them)!  He has also been in rehabilitative therapy since almost 5 months old.  He was late to crawl, late to talk (he was 3 years old), and still lags behind his typically-developing peers on many levels.  But, he is defying the odds, as he is making waves as he grows stronger and smarter every day!  He is a friend to all, always makes sure to share, and has a happy spirit and pure soul that we all envy. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What Is A Chromosome 18 Diagnosis?</h3>
<p>If you are like us, our friends, many of the doctors we have met, and even Lane's geneticist, you have never heard of this group of diagnoses.  <strong><em>The prevalence is 1 in 50,000 live births!</em></strong> There are several different Chromosome 18 syndromes that may arise due to unexpected developmental events that occur before birth.  A child may be born with a ""duplication"" of part of the 18th chromosome;  that child has ""extra"" DNA.  Or, a child may be born with a ""deletion"" of part of the 18th chromosome;  that child is ""missing"" DNA.  Since Lane is missing part of the p arm of the 18th chromosome, he has a diagnosis of 18p deletion syndrome.</p>
<p>Regardless of the diagnosis, most affected individuals are cognitively challenged, and they often have difficulties with speech and also with gross and fine motor coordination.  Other common findings are growth hormone deficiency, heart defects, thyroid disorders, and difficulties with social interactions with their peers.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How Can You Help?</h3>
<p>My wife, Becky, and I have volunteered to host a 2013 Chromosome 18 Family Conference in Savannah, GA.  It is scheduled for July 28th - 31st.  We hope that this time together will be a great benefit to those children affected by a Chromosome 18 diagnosis, as well as their families.  We have a full schedule of experts that have volunteered their time to help with education at our conference.  Talks are scheduled to be given by an ear/nose/throat physician, a pediatric behavioral physician, a speech therapist, a physical therapist, an occupational therapist, a pediatric play therapist, two lawyers who specialize in special needs planning, a certified special needs financial planner, and a genetic counselor.  Also, the staff from The Chromosome 18 Research Society will be on hand, to continue the research that has benefited so many in our extended Chromosome 18 Family.  The Chromosome 18 Registry and Research Society is a non-profit organization, based at the University of Texas at San Antonio.  Blood work and further developmental screens are scheduled for many of those affected who will be attending.  It is SO important that this research continues, and having many of those affected in the same city will be very helpful. </p>
<p>So far we have between 400 and 500 people who hope to be in Savannah this July.  We're estimating the cost of the conference will be close to $40,000.  In addition to covering research costs at the conference, we will have additional child supervision provided by Corporate Kids, which has certified personnel trained to assist those who are medically fragile or have special needs.  We also hope to provide as many meals for attendees as is possible.  We have reached out to some local sources to assist with funding, and have also applied for special needs grants from several national businesses.  However, we have no idea how successful those options will be.  What we do know is that the importance of our cause is far-reaching, and the power of giving in America and all around the world is humbling!  Please help us make this conference a success for our Chromosome 18 kids and their families.  We think $5,000 through indiegogo is a realistic goal to reach, with the help of our new friends and supporters who have read our story here.  Please also remember that all contributions are tax deductible. </p>

served as a basketball, football, and hockey camp counselor for the University

through his volunteer work with the Black Bear Mentor Program and teaching
field experience in the Kinesiology and Physical Education Program. These
experiences allowed Boone to infer that 1) the prevalence of obese and
low-income youth in central ME was just as severe, if not worse than the
Washington, D.C. metropolitan area where he was raised; and 2) These at risk
and obese youth miss the opportunity to experience the more elite summer
programs do to their parents/guardians inability to afford them, and in return
will result to at-risk behaviors during the summer months where idle time is
more common.</span></p><p></p></span><p></p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: Verdana;"">As a former student
athlete, it is Boone’s belief that for youth to become successful adults, they
must see successful people on a regular basis, which is rarely the case in the
lower socioeconomic neighborhoods SM-SB, Inc. targets participants. For this
reason, we focus on employing student athletes, as they are competent in
physical activity, disciplined students, motivated ambassadors of their
hometowns and universties, and lastly every child's role model!</span></p>

by DHHS. Over the past three summers, SM-SB, Inc. has served over 250 youth from Washington, D.C. and Orono, Maine,
and employed nearly 20 University of Maine students on very limited funding. About 80% of all participnats reported involvement in extracurricular activies during the fall season, improved school attendance, and all express interest in attending college. </p>
<p>Without
sponsorship from supporters like you, this elite program would struggle to
carryout our mission of improving the quality of life for families,
neighborhoods, and communities, which we feel will result in a stronger, more

academic success. All very important to the advancement of the United States,

What We Need & What You Get

for every person and business, at every level in society. Sponsorship levels range from Bronze to Platinum and can be found in the ""perks"" section.  All donations are tax deductible!
The Impact



SM-SB, Inc. offers all of our services free of charge to
youth ages 10-17 coming from households that meet the low-income guidelines set
by DHHS. Over the past three summers, SM-SB, Inc. has served over 250 youth from Washington, D.C. and Orono, Maine,
and employed nearly 20 University of Maine students on very limited funding. About 80% of all participnats reported involvement in extracurricular activies during the fall season, improved school attendance, and all express interest in attending college. 
Without
sponsorship from supporters like you, this elite program would struggle to
carryout our mission of improving the quality of life for families,
neighborhoods, and communities, which we feel will result in a stronger, more
physically fit America!
By sponsoring a participant for a little as $135.13, the Strong
Mind-Strong Body, Inc. Wellness and Nutrition Summer Program can educate a
child coming from a financially deprived home on the benefits of healthy/active
lifestyles, competitive team sport participation, positive decision-making and
academic success. All very important to the advancement of the United States,
as we are the most obese Nation in the world!
Thank you for taking the time to review SM-SB, Inc.’s
proposal. I hope you find our mission worthy of your investment!

<p>     My name is Adam Hynes, and I am trying to raise enough money for my good friend Richard Vanwormer to pay for a surgery he DESPERATELY needs. </p>
<p>     Richard was a surgical assistant in Dallas, Tx in 1997.  One night after his shift in the operating room, he stopped at a convenience store where he was randomly robbed and shot in the chest at point blank range.  He did not have health insurance at the time, and still does not.  The bullet is resting on a crucial nerve, causing him constant severe pain.  He also developed neuropathy as a results of the bullet.  See a description of neuropathy here- <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001784/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001784/</a> .  Over the years since the shooting, the neuropathy has consistantly gotten worse and worse.  He was no longer well enough to work around 2004.  At this point he is almost constantly in extreme pain.  His neuropathy causes his skin to feel like it's on fire on his face and back.  He has extreme nerve pain in his chest near the bullet.  He has extreme pain in his back and neck from muscles that are constanly tense and full of knots.  He is nearing the end of his ability to sustain such a nightmare of a life.  He is bedridden almost all the time.  Getting up to get food, drink, or use the bathroom is difficult enough that he is becoming malnurished and dehydrated.  The photo included with this campaign was taken about a year and a half ago, and he is noticeably thinner now.  Going to his monthly doctor visit is an enormous challenge, and leaves him in extra pain for days.  He has suicidal thoughts as a result of everything he has to endure.</p>
<p>     Richard lives in a 1973 RV, but will run out of money for rent within 2 or 3 months.  Government employees are in the process of trying to get him into an assisted living center, and also trying to get him on medicaid, even though he was denied social security disability and medicaid already.  Should he recieve any help from medicaid, or any other source, I will update this campaign to reflect the situation as it stands.  He is currently trying to recieve financial help from medicaid, and ""texas Crime Victims fund"".  We are also trying to convince our local hospital, Poudre Valley Hospital, to help him with the surgery he needs.   Richard currently recieves only $375 per month in help from all available sources.  We believe it is a real tragedy of justice that he has been denied any kind of medical help from the system that he paid into all the years working before he was no longer able to.  Richard has always impressed his friends with the discipline, tenacity, and drive he has shown in his efforts to help himself.</p>
<p>     As complicated a situation as it is, it really comes down to a simple point.  Richard MUST have the bullet removed from his chest if there is any chance he will live a life worth living.  If he does not have this surgery, I am very worried we will lose him to suicide.  He is already on the very edge of his ability to continue this way.</p>
<p>     We predict that the costs involved in having the surgery and recovering from it to be around $150,000.  There is a very lengthly recovery time involved in a surgery like this.  To remove the bullet, they must cut through nerve tissue.  They say it takes 2 to 5 years for your nerves to heal, assuming they do heal.  This campaign has one simple goal, to get the surgery.  As the campaign moves forward, we will be updating it to reflect numbers more accurate to what Richard needs.  Most likely the amount needed for the surgery will be different than our predicted cost.  The amount needed may be significantly more, or significantly less then $150,000.  If we accidentally raise more money than is needed, I promise to donate ALL of this extra money to a fund meant to help people with their medical bills, surgeries, or medical research.  Where the money is spent will be made public information, along with proof of where it goes.  Richard hopes to use this money to pay for a surgey, and allow him the ability to recover from it as well.  He will not be able to work during his recovery, so he will need very basic living expenses to be covered(rent, food, utilities, doctor visits).  The recovery period may last years, but we will know more once he can afford to see a doctor about the surgery and ask questions like how long the recovery will be.  This campaign will be handled as transparantly as possible, out of respect for those who wish to help Richard.  NONE of the funds raised by this campaign will be used in any other way.</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Who am I?</strong></p>
<p>My name is Jackson, or Jacks for short. I’m a 23 year old transman or female-to-male transgender individual. As an adolescent, I wanted so badly to look like the buff shirtless men I saw on television and in advertisements. I hated myself for not having the body that I wanted, for instead having a body and chest that didn’t even feel like mine. As I grew older, I learned to accept that this was the body I was given and it’s the only one I’m going to get. So no matter what, I’m going to try to make the best of it in any way I can.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>My transition</strong></p>
<p>It’s hard to look in the mirror and not recognize the body that you see. It’s mind-numbing and demoralizing. Thankfully we live in modern times and there are options available for guys like me. I started testosterone treatments 6 months ago and the changes have been fantastic. Little by little each day, I move closer to my ideal. <strong>I can’t describe how wonderful it is to see myself becoming the man I have longed to be.</strong> But each day, I feel my chest, knowing that my body is still wrong in a rush of sadness, alienation, and anxiety. So I bind my chest flat daily and suffer the unfortunate side effects like blisters, sweat rashes, and a variety of other hazardous health effects from binding my chest flat.</p>
<p>My family, while being the wonderfully supportive folks that they are, do not support my decision to get surgery or any kind of medical intervention involving my gender, so I am financially on my own. I would not be able to afford the hormone treatments if it wasn’t for the care of the Mazzoni Center, an LGBT clinic in Philadelphia that provides low-cost or no-cost services to poor transmen like myself. I have also been in therapy for some time and can provide the required letter of recommendation, saying that “<strong>transgender surgery is the next step in the transition process</strong>”, a qualification also provided by the Trans Standards of Care (WPATH).</p>
<p>For me, top surgery represents the biggest happiness I can imagine, starting from when I was a young child. After years of research, advice, and self-reflection, I’ve made the final decision to pursue top surgery. At the end of the procedure, I will have a sculpted male chest. <strong>But the most valuable part of the surgery is that I will finally feel at home in my own body</strong>. All I want is to be happy and this is the key to it. And I will be the happiest bare-chested boy you’ve ever seen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So I am humbly asking for your help and support to make this possible, to make my dream a reality.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>I need your help!</strong></p>
<p>Top surgery is very expensive, especially for a recently graduated young man attempting to make his way in the world. I’m in a professional training program for my dream profession right now, but the pay is dismal and most of it goes to pay for rent, bills, and food, so that I can survive. In this situation, it’s very difficult to find the money to put away for something that will help me thrive.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So this is where you kind folks come in. Here’s the breakdown of surgery costs.</p>
<p>Doctor’s fees: approximately $5,000</p>
<p>Surgery center anesthesia fee: $1300</p>
<p>Additional costs (transportation, blood tests, other hospital fees): $600-$1000</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This seems like an insurmountable cost, but no amount is to small or too great. Every donation is a little piece of joy, a smile just for you, knowing I am one step closer to my dream, my one hope, becoming a reality.</p>
<p>Even if you can’t personally contribute, pass the word along. Signal boost. Send this to your friends and neighbors and allies. Because this surgery will literally change my life. For the first time, I will be able to feel my body and not feel dysphoria and pain; there will only be joy, happiness, and possibility. And that truly is the greatest gift of all.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>EDIT (2/4/13): When I initially set this up, the perks did not save for some reason. I've fixed that and the perks are now up. For those of you who've already donated and would like to claim your perk, feel free to send a pesonal email to me (<a href=""mailto:jacks.a.katz@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">jacks.a.katz@gmail.com</a>).

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>I am an artist (and college student) who just had one of the most painful days in my life (physically and monetarily). I broke a side of my tooth weeks ago while eating and had absolutely no side effects until today. The pain came so sudden my jaw started shaking and I nearly passed out on the street. After going to see a dentist he filled my tooth temporarily but explained I need a root canal and crown (a $5000 dental procedure). I have no insurance and no one in my family to ask for this amount of money (my mother cannot help me we need a roof to sleep under and food to eat and my grandmother is in the hospital).</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I do not want your paycheck I get one every 2 weeks but I don't make enough money to afford this procedure so soon though. If my tooth gets further infected I could be hospitalized or I could get lockjaw which could kill me. Your help will prolong my existence longer.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What I need is $5000 because I do not have insurance. $2000 goes to a root canal and $2000 goes to a crown and $1000 goes to filling in the tooth and fixing the remainder of my tooth. I do not expect that big of a donation but anything helps. I have school loans to pay off but if I do not reach my goal I will have to obtain a third party financing plan with plenty of interest. I do not have any credit so I will not be able to obtain this easily either. Any contribution will help me avoid adding money to my loans. </p>
<p>If you indeed can help me out I've decided to put my artistic talents to use as a thank you if you donate any of these amounts:</p>
<p>- $15 to $24 - you will receive a hand-made original watercolor thank you card.</p>
<p>- $25 and above- you will receive a one of a kind 11""x14"" watercolor painting + thank you card.</p>
<p>- $50 and above - you will receive a one of a kind 16""x20"" watercolor painting + thank you card.</p>
<p>- $100 and above - you will receive a one of a kind 22""x30"" watercolor painting + thank you card.</p>
<p>- above $250 - you will get all three one of a kind artworks and a thank you card.</p>
<p>All works will be made by me after donations are received so that I can keep any cost of supplies to a minimum and most of the supplies I already have so none of my donation money will be going to them, just to my teeth.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand financial situations (since I am having my own as I explain this). Even if you can't help me financially your voice helps too. If you know anyone that could help save my mouth with even a dollar or two please spread my plea. I thank you all for your time, (money) and voice. </p>

I am an artist (and college student) who just had one of the most painful days in my life (physically and monetarily). I broke a side of my tooth weeks ago while eating and had absolutely no side effects until today. The pain came so sudden my jaw started shaking and I nearly passed out on the street. After going to see a dentist he filled my tooth temporarily but explained I need a root canal and crown (a $5000 dental procedure). I have no insurance and no one in my family to ask for this amount of money (my mother cannot help me we need a roof to sleep under and food to eat and my grandmother is in the hospital).

<p>for 12 years i have been working with so many awesome and wonderful kiddos with different abilities in a great variety of capacities; schools, their homes, my home, in the community, etc. i have loved every minute of it...even, and sometimes especially, the many challenges! now i am looking at expanding upon my substantial skill set so i can support these dear little ones from another angle. enter the bodytalk whole healthcare system...</p>

<p>for those of you new to this world...<br/></p>
<p>bodytalk is an integrative, consciousness based holistic healthcare system based on the philosophy that the body has an innate wisdom to know what is wrong and is capable of healing itself at all levels. sometimes this ability is compromised due to communication break downs within the body-mind complex leading to disease. one of the core philosophies of the bodytalk system is that all disease 
found in the body is reflected in the brain at some level. what the bodytalk system provides then, is the right conditions for reestablishing communication. the practitioner, as the observer, acts somewhat like a translator collecting information regarding these breakdowns then, through the bodytalk protocol facilitates a restoration of 
communication between parts of the brain as well as between the brain and all other body systems. Improving this communication can quickly and 
easily address many physical issues, as well as improve brain function overall. <br/></p>

<p>Say you don't have time or motivation to go to the gym every day, but you spend half an hour or more commuting to work. You could use Twicycle as a means of travel to work and at the same time get a great full body workout as a side benefit. <br/>Riding is so much fun that without even realizing you will be doing a much higher intensity workout then you might do indoors for example.</p>

<p><br/>One could use Twicycle arm cranks for short bursts at high intensity, putting max power on the arm cranks, similar to what a sprinter or track cyclist might do. This would also replicate doing sets in the gym.</p>
<p>If above is used with legs at the same time it will result in immediate higher top speed and acceleration.</p>

<p><br/>Cycling for longer periods (endurance cycling) at a prescribed fitness plan (talk to your personal fitness adviser about the best plan for you) is great for weight loss as it burns a lot of energy and stored fats. With a normal bicycle, doing workouts in short succession (let's say on daily basis) starting with Monday, might leave your leg muscles too tired for the next day (Tuesday). But if you used Twicycle with both arms and legs you can burn the same amount of fuel/fat on Monday but be tiring each muscle group much less as the load is spread between them so you'd feel fresher for Tuesday.</p>

If you are a cyclist, you no longer have to pick additional activity to workout your upper body. This bike does it all.
 

 
In addition to legs, you can work out your entire upper body by using the front cranks. Fire up your TRICEPS, CHEST, LATS, BICEPS, BACK and SHOULDERS. Strengthen your CORE. 

 



 
 


 
 


Workout the muscles on your entire body by using a combination of arm and leg cranks.
 
 


Twicycle makes climbing easier and faster as the load is spread over several limbs, resulting in less fatigue and less lactic acid build-up on each individual limb.
 
 


Because you can take over with your arms when your legs get tired, you can continue going when you would normally need a break.
 
 
 

 

 
 


Stay seated in your seat, evenly distributing weight to both wheels when going up steep hills in order to avoid loss of traction.
By pedaling with both arms and legs you can avoid ""wheel spin"" due to slippery road conditions.
 
 


By propelling yourself forward using both legs and arms at the same time, you benefit from increased power needed for sprints.
 
 


Get everything you normally would on a regular road bike + a lot more! 
Use Twicycle like a regular bike by pedaling with your legs only. Take over with your arms to give legs a break.
 
 

 

 


 
Special thanks to all media outlets that were kind to write about us.
 

 

 
 

Say you don't have time or motivation to go to the gym every day, but you spend half an hour or more commuting to work. You could use Twicycle as a means of travel to work and at the same time get a great full body workout as a side benefit. Riding is so much fun that without even realizing you will be doing a much higher intensity workout then you might do indoors for example.
 
 

One could use Twicycle arm cranks for short bursts at high intensity, putting max power on the arm cranks, similar to what a sprinter or track cyclist might do. This would also replicate doing sets in the gym.
If above is used with legs at the same time it will result in immediate higher top speed and acceleration.
 
 

Cycling for longer periods (endurance cycling) at a prescribed fitness plan (talk to your personal fitness adviser about the best plan for you) is great for weight loss as it burns a lot of energy and stored fats. With a normal bicycle, doing workouts in short succession (let's say on daily basis) starting with Monday, might leave your leg muscles too tired for the next day (Tuesday). But if you used Twicycle with both arms and legs you can burn the same amount of fuel/fat on Monday but be tiring each muscle group much less as the load is spread between them so you'd feel fresher for Tuesday.
 

 

 
 

 
 
 


Cast out of carbon fiber, the arm cranks are lightweight and super strong, doubling as steering handles. They can achieve tight maneuvers and allow you to pedal while turning.
 
 


Chest pad provides full upper body support while cycling with arms and prevents a rider from making contact with the chainring.
 
 


Twicycle comes with 8 gears on each drive system allowing you to perfectly adjust the resistance to fit your needs and driving conditions.
 
 


Twicycle utilizes a combination of high strength lightweight aluminium and carbon fiber for reliable, optimum performance.
 
 


Two independently operated drive systems use freewheels, so you can coast with either one to suit your riding style and situation.
 
 


Twicycle is equally suitable for both women and men.
 
 


Brakes are located on the handles.
 
 


An optional chain guard can also be fitted for those who feel the added accessory would benefit them and can be purchased as the extra perk as listed on this platform. Note that the chest pad prevents a rider from reaching the chainring.
 
 

 
The locking mechanism allows the main handlebar/crank to be locked in drop bar position. The handle grips will have some movement but the whole system can not rotate and can not provide drive to front wheel in this position.
 

 

 

 
Please note that these are preliminary specs and are subject to change based on manufacturer availability and prices.

<li>
<b>No Chain, Grease Free, Low Maintenance</b> - Gates Belt Drives are unique because they're made of rubber reinforced with carbon fiber. They last 7x longer than chains, do not rust, do not need grease, and create a wonderfully smooth ride. </li>
<li>
<b>Durable, Light, Strong</b> - Our frames are built of 4130 Chromoly Steel. You won't break it and you can lift the bike with ease. </li>
<li>
<b>3 Speeds</b> - and 3 speeds only! We were bored of decision making paralysis, so we picked the best for you. Having 3 speeds optimizes your range per gear. It's perfect for riding in most conditions. Fun fact: the French used to use 3 speeds for their touring (long distances) gear set.</li>
<li>
<b>Internally Geared Hub</b> - That means all the gears are INSIDE the back wheel! Whaaa! Internally geared hubs are low maintenance, easy to adjust, and use no grease. The majority of bike share programs use this type of hub because of its durability. </li>
<li>
<b>Unique Features + Low Price Point </b>- You'll be hard-pressed to find any belt driven bikes at your local bike shop (except our wonderful partners). In fact, you won't find any other  Gates belt bike at this price point. There's no doubt that this is the ""drive"" you want on your everyday bike.</li>

<p><b>What size is the frame?</b></p>
<p>We have 3 frame sizes built for SMALL (if you're 5'0""-5'4""), MEDIUM (if you're 5'5""- 5'7""), and LARGE (if you're 5'8"" - 6'2"") riders. Pick your size based on your height and, if you fall on a border, size down (it’s better to be able to touch the pedals!). </p>
<p><b>What size are the tires?</b></p>
<p>26"" x 1.5""</p>
<p><b>Is the frame aluminum or steel?</b></p>
<p>4130 Chromoly Steel. Very durable and the frames are average weight for commuter bikes. </p>
<p><b>How much does the THIN weigh?</b></p>
<p>The bike weighs 28 pounds. </p>
<p><b>What are the benefits of the Gates Carbon Drive?</b></p>
<p>They’re low maintenance, you need no grease to keep it running, it lasts 7x than a chain, and works on an internally geared back hub system (so the gears are less likely to get out of whack, and when they do, it’s easy to adjust). </p>

</div></div>","Founded with the RECKLESS OPTIMISM and sincere belief that bikes should be part of everyone's everyday. 

At Bikes ORO, we believe bikes can connect the world through community building, individual empowerment, and access to opportunity. Everyone should have the chance to own and ride a bike. For every ORO bike purchased, we support the donation of a bike to someone in need. 

This campaign is an opportunity to claim one of the first batches of ORO bikes and join us in building a more sustainable world.


Why ORO? Hear it straight from ORO's founder, Chelsea: 


""ORO started as inspiration to find a way to sustainably fund getting bikes to people in need. I spent time living in Uganda and Bolivia and saw how powerful access to a bike could be to change someone's life. I set out to solidly link the profit and the non-profit sides of bikes. Because, in my opinion, bikes enable access to opportunity and that is a beautiful thing that everyone deserves. 
The more I thought about our lifestyle, the more I saw the opportunity ORO could fulfill at home: to make biking accessible to an ever broadening bike ridership. Lots of people work hard to take care of their health, take care of our environment, run races for charity, the list goes on! Those people who CARE seem like people who should be on bikes, some are and some aren't. 





Why are some of these people not riding? It comes down to a lot of things, but at it's core,  it's accessibility. People don't know what to buy, how to discern the quality, or how to care for a bike. With Bikes ORO, we designed the bikes to be simple. They're low maintenance and great for getting around town, commuting or going to the farmers market.



They're for everyday use and suited well for most situations. We're telling you about the bike the way it is, not with advanced terms, but simply by how it can be used. 


So, the question comes down to, why not bike? And we've got a good one for you, so read on for bike details! "" - Chelsea, Founder, Bikes ORO








No Chain, Grease Free, Low Maintenance - Gates Belt Drives are unique because they're made of rubber reinforced with carbon fiber. They last 7x longer than chains, do not rust, do not need grease, and create a wonderfully smooth ride. 

Durable, Light, Strong - Our frames are built of 4130 Chromoly Steel. You won't break it and you can lift the bike with ease. 

3 Speeds - and 3 speeds only! We were bored of decision making paralysis, so we picked the best for you. Having 3 speeds optimizes your range per gear. It's perfect for riding in most conditions. Fun fact: the French used to use 3 speeds for their touring (long distances) gear set.

Internally Geared Hub - That means all the gears are INSIDE the back wheel! Whaaa! Internally geared hubs are low maintenance, easy to adjust, and use no grease. The majority of bike share programs use this type of hub because of its durability. 

Unique Features + Low Price Point - You'll be hard-pressed to find any belt driven bikes at your local bike shop (except our wonderful partners). In fact, you won't find any other  Gates belt bike at this price point. There's no doubt that this is the ""drive"" you want on your everyday bike.





FYI: We are only launching the PORTEUR model through this Indiegogo campaign. That's the bike pictured above with the basket! If you'd prefer one of the other 2 models, email chelsea@bikesoro.com with the subject ""Model request""  and she'll add you to the waiting list. Estimated production is 2017 for those models. 
FYI #2: We removed the fun spoke design (the metal pieces inside the wheels). They're ""standard"" style again. The styling can throw off the calibration of the wheel and make it become distorted. We are putting your safety first! 



The unique ORO design - curved of the top tube, beautifully colored spacers, 26"" tires, delightful front basket and more - comes from the bike design powerhouse, Flying Machine.  FM's Founder and Master Builder, Matthew Andrew, custom designs and hand builds stunning, high-end, bikes for people around the world. 









Bikes are engines of social and economic change for people globally - especially those living in impoverished conditions. Currently, there is no way to sustainably fund bike distribution for people in need, so that is why we created Bikes ORO. Access to mobility is POWERFUL — to enable children to get to school, men & women to access professional opportunities, and anyone to reach quality health clinics. 


Over 15% of the profit from each bike sale goes to support getting people access to these bikes (specific % not available because shipping costs can vary changing the numbers). 


For STUDENTS: Attendance increases up to 28% and grades increase up to 56%




For ENTREPRENEURS: Individuals can travel up to 4x farther, carrying 5x more, leading to up to 50% increases in profits. 





Over 15% of our profits from each bike sale in this campaign go to World Bicycle Relief to help get a student, entrepreneur, or healthcare worker onto a Buffalo bike (pictured below). These bikes are custom designed for carrying large loads, durability, and ease of maintenance. They're also assembled in country -- providing jobs to people in the area -- and distributed in partnership with local nonprofits to individuals.





Check World Bicycle Relief's website for additional information on the specific design of the Buffalo Bike.  











THE PERKS! 


















 
The good news is that we have spent over a year designing, prototyping, and setting up this company to manufacture and fulfill successfully. We pledge to be upfront with you and transparent throughout the entire process, so you can stay updated on any challenges we may face (and help us celebrate success!). 

Not meeting the entire funding goal (flex account): We picked an Indiegogo Flex Campaign, meaning that we will receive the money this campaign generates even if we do not hit our goal number. The reason we picked flex is because we are able to support more payment methods for you. If we do not not hit our goal, our timeline could be delayed while we raise the additional capital to build your bike. We are  working hard to make sure this does not happen! 


Manufacturing: Mass production manufacturing can be risky and unexpected variables can arise. Luckily, we have a great team for manufacturing and they have been working in industry for years. They've been nothing but trustworthy and timely throughout our prototyping process, so we are excited to be working with them for a bigger production round. 


Fulfillment: After we place our order, there are things that can happen to impede our process efficiency. One of the component manufacturers could deliver their product slowly, a shipment could be lost, an important machine could break, import ports could go on strike. This is part of the risk you take with international manufacturing and fulfillment, but again, we fully trust the team we have in place to minimize any unforeseen delays. 








What size is the frame?
We have 3 frame sizes built for SMALL (if you're 5'0""-5'4""), MEDIUM (if you're 5'5""- 5'7""), and LARGE (if you're 5'8"" - 6'2"") riders. Pick your size based on your height and, if you fall on a border, size down (it’s better to be able to touch the pedals!). 
What size are the tires?
26"" x 1.5""
Is the frame aluminum or steel?
4130 Chromoly Steel. Very durable and the frames are average weight for commuter bikes. 
How much does the THIN weigh?
The bike weighs 28 pounds. 
What are the benefits of the Gates Carbon Drive?
They’re low maintenance, you need no grease to keep it running, it lasts 7x than a chain, and works on an internally geared back hub system (so the gears are less likely to get out of whack, and when they do, it’s easy to adjust). 
Is there a way for me to ride one of these bikes? 
We’re throwing launch parties at a few breweries across the country where we’ll have ONE, medium sized frame with us. We’d love for you to come and give it a ride, test it out. Parties in Cape May, NJ; Cincinnati, OH; Denver, CO; Boulder, CO; Philadelphia, PA; and Washington DC. Check out our event locations here. 
What is the gear ratio of the drive systems?
3 speed. Best gear range for most situations — from flat to reasonably hilly. 
Does this bike have quick release on the tires? 
The front tire has quick release.
When will I receive my ORO bike? 
Check out the Timeline above for that information. 
Can I get a refund?
Please read Indiegogo's policy here. 
Who is responsible for any additional taxes, duties or VAT?
The backer is responsible for any additional taxes.

So, here is how we are preparing for risks and challenges.</p><p>MANUFACTURING: YOGGI Ball has a revolutionary design, which means there’s some complex tooling, manufacturing processes and precise engineering needed to create the product. In a large-scale manufacturing project of this kind, there’s the potential for challenges to arise with setting up tooling, sourcing materials and the manufacturing process itself.</p><p>Our design team is highly experienced when it comes to working on complex manufacturing projects like YOGGI Ball.

By working with our established manufacturing partners and being on the ground to monitor and inspect the process, we are putting every effort into ensuring the high standard of product we require and you deserve. We will also perform industry-standard quality control testing to ensure we deliver the highest quality product.</p><p>PRODUCT CHANGES: We’ve spent close to a year designing YOGGI Ball. The product you see is extremely close to the final design. But, as we enter full-scale production, some minor changes may be needed to manufacture at scale. This process is commonly known as Design For Manufacturing, and is a routine part of manufacturing. Any changes made during this stage will only be made to create an even better product. We’ll be sure to let you know of any changes we make. And exactly why we made them.FULFILLMENT: We’ll work with a third-party fulfillment specialist to get you your product as quickly and smoothly as possible. However, delays and unforeseen circumstances can be a part of any delivery process. However, by working with an experienced logistics partner, we’re minimizing the risk of issues.</p></div>","Introducing YOGGI BALL, the most versatile, convenient and compact massage system ever invented. YOGGI BALL features a revolutionary all-in-one Modular Quick-Lock System.

No one likes to pay to ship, and we are committed to doing our best to minimize its impact on everyone.About The YOGGI BALL TeamYOGGI BALL is the creation of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Champion Fernando Junior and Yoga teacher Arvy Chan, in partnership with UUUSH Physio Therapist Centre. Fernando has spent most of his life training and practicing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu at the highest level. While Arvy has dedicated her life to the pursuit of health and wellness through Yoga.After years searching for the perfect recovery tool, the company founders invented YOGGI BALL, designed in conjunction with leading physiotherapist Dickson Lam.Now, they need the generous support of the amazing Kickstarter community to bring their vision to life!Fernando Junior “Having spent decades practicing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, recovering from aches and pains has been the number one thing that slowed my progress and held me back,” “I have tried just about every other kind of massage device but found they fell short of the therapy and healing I needed. So, I set out to create the most versatile and effective recovery tool available – YOGGI BALL.”Arvy Chan“Everyone’s pain and recovery is different. And with YOGGI BALL you can fully customize and personalize your treatment with an amazing variety of attachments and functions.” Alliance for quality assurance of crowdfunding's product developmentHong Kong’s first and only centre of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Capoeira, Yoga and Movement. Uuush Physiotherapy Centre specializes in a wide range of physiotherapy services to get clients feeling healthier than ever before. Dedicated Crowdfunding PR and Marketing AgencyRisks and challengesWith any new product launched on Kickstarter there are potential challenges that exist in design and manufacturing.But, know this, we have assembled a team of highly experienced design, manufacturing and supply-chain specialists to understand and minimize all potential risks. But, as any product developer will tell you, it’s impossible to rule them out completely. We want to be transparent with you. So, here is how we are preparing for risks and challenges.MANUFACTURING: YOGGI Ball has a revolutionary design, which means there’s some complex tooling, manufacturing processes and precise engineering needed to create the product. In a large-scale manufacturing project of this kind, there’s the potential for challenges to arise with setting up tooling, sourcing materials and the manufacturing process itself.Our design team is highly experienced when it comes to working on complex manufacturing projects like YOGGI Ball. And our established relationships with a reliable and reputable manufacturer minimizes manufacturing risks significantly. Plus, YOGGI Ball team members will be on the ground working directly with our manufacturer to oversee every step of the process.QUALITY CONTROL: When manufacturing at scale, it’s common for there to be a variance in quality due to the large number of units being produced. By working with our established manufacturing partners and being on the ground to monitor and inspect the process, we are putting every effort into ensuring the high standard of product we require and you deserve. We will also perform industry-standard quality control testing to ensure we deliver the highest quality product.PRODUCT CHANGES: We’ve spent close to a year designing YOGGI Ball. The product you see is extremely close to the final design. But, as we enter full-scale production, some minor changes may be needed to manufacture at scale. This process is commonly known as Design For Manufacturing, and is a routine part of manufacturing. Any changes made during this stage will only be made to create an even better product. We’ll be sure to let you know of any changes we make. And exactly why we made them.FULFILLMENT: We’ll work with a third-party fulfillment specialist to get you your product as quickly and smoothly as possible. However, delays and unforeseen circumstances can be a part of any delivery process. However, by working with an experienced logistics partner, we’re minimizing the risk of issues.",58.0,4,"1 Campaign

<p>Together we can provide proven technological solutions to
helping the world feed itself and ensure abundant food and pure water for all.  The revolution that cell phones brought to
communications will be dwarfed by the impact nano bubble technology will have
on feeding the world.</p>
<p><b>What we need and what
you get:</b></p>
<p>By this appeal we want to raise $275,000, which we believe
will give us the start we need to bring our nano bubble agriculture, aquaculture
and water purification systems to a stage of development at which they may be
efficiently manufactured and used anyplace in the world.</p>
<p>With these funds we will design, test , and manufacture prototypes of
 nano bubble systems for agriculture, aquaculture and water 
purification. These products will  then be available to be commercialized worldwide.<br/></p>
<p>Speaking of products, we have a range of unique products from artisans across East and West Africa for all contributors who believe in a world free of hunger and abundant pure water.  Please see our perks. Perhaps you would like to have breakfast with an elephant! <br/></p>
<p><b>Impact:</b></p>
<p>Recent scientific studies have declared that the three
serious challenges face the new generation: producing enough nutritious food to
feed the ever growing world population, providing pure clean water for the
health of the world's people and mitigating against the impact of climate
change.</p>
<p>According to Harvard Physicist Dr. Russell Seitz ;</p>
<p><b>"" The low energy cost of micro bubbles suggests a new approach to solar radiation management in water conversation and geo engineering. Don't dim the sun, brighten the water""</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1050847/files/20141127032317-nano_bubbles_and_water_conservation.jpg?1417087397"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>Dr. Seitz suggests that nano bubble injection into a 1 hectare water pan will save 3600 MT of water annually by reducing the evaporation rate.</b><br/></p>
<p>Our project- nano bubbles for food abundance and pure water
- addresses these three issues and offers solutions. </p>
<p>I and many colleagues worldwide have been looking for a way to make a major impact on resolving the food and water security problems of Africa and worldwide.  <br/></p>
<p>This is our biggest step yet and the most important. Rather
than solving problems one at a time, we can now through nanotechnology take a
broad sweep and make that ""game changing"" step that will make the
difference. </p>
<p>We need your help. We honestly believe that nano bubble
technology can make that big difference. <br/></p>
<p><b>                                                Too good to be true? <br/></b></p>
<p><b>That's what they
said about television, the fax machine, the internet and the cell phone. </b></p>
<p>Join with our team and together we can  bring this huge dream of a
hunger free world to reality.</p>
<p></p> <p> </p> <br/>
</div><div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges </h3>
<p>Our biggest challenge will be to overcome the "" skepticism and too good to be true attitude"" that has encompassed many in the international community when we introduce new technologies- much like the cell phone and the internet.</p>
<p>In order to mitigate this challenge we have  made arrangements with the University of the Cape Coast in Ghana to certify the trials for   the aquaculture system; the University of Ghana  and the University of Nairobi for the agriculture systems and with World Vision in northern Kenya for water purification and conservation.<br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can help financially - THANK YOU. But there are many others ways that  we can use your  help.</p>
<p>1) If you believe in a technological solution to severe world problems and have ideas of how technology can be applied- please tell us. We may even retain you to help us develop your idea.<br/></p>
<p>2) Tell you friends and colleagues who might be  able to contribute financially or with great ideas . <br/></p>
<p>3) Help us with this  and other campaigns. What are we doing right ? What are we doing wrong?  Your opinion and advise will help us do better. Thank you.</p>
<p>4) Use your savvy of social network and help us get the word out. Tell us what you are doing or what you think we should be doing and we will work with you. </p>

Nano bubble water  will bring clean water to children at a low cost
Together we can provide proven technological solutions to
helping the world feed itself and ensure abundant food and pure water for all.  The revolution that cell phones brought to
communications will be dwarfed by the impact nano bubble technology will have
on feeding the world.
What we need and what
you get:
By this appeal we want to raise $275,000, which we believe
will give us the start we need to bring our nano bubble agriculture, aquaculture
and water purification systems to a stage of development at which they may be
efficiently manufactured and used anyplace in the world.
With these funds we will design, test , and manufacture prototypes of
 nano bubble systems for agriculture, aquaculture and water 
purification. These products will  then be available to be commercialized worldwide.
Speaking of products, we have a range of unique products from artisans across East and West Africa for all contributors who believe in a world free of hunger and abundant pure water.  Please see our perks. Perhaps you would like to have breakfast with an elephant! 
Impact:
Recent scientific studies have declared that the three
serious challenges face the new generation: producing enough nutritious food to
feed the ever growing world population, providing pure clean water for the
health of the world's people and mitigating against the impact of climate
change.
According to Harvard Physicist Dr. Russell Seitz ;
"" The low energy cost of micro bubbles suggests a new approach to solar radiation management in water conversation and geo engineering. Don't dim the sun, brighten the water""


Dr. Seitz suggests that nano bubble injection into a 1 hectare water pan will save 3600 MT of water annually by reducing the evaporation rate.
Our project- nano bubbles for food abundance and pure water
- addresses these three issues and offers solutions. 
I and many colleagues worldwide have been looking for a way to make a major impact on resolving the food and water security problems of Africa and worldwide.  
This is our biggest step yet and the most important. Rather
than solving problems one at a time, we can now through nanotechnology take a
broad sweep and make that ""game changing"" step that will make the
difference. 
We need your help. We honestly believe that nano bubble
technology can make that big difference. 
                                                Too good to be true? 
That's what they
said about television, the fax machine, the internet and the cell phone. 
Join with our team and together we can  bring this huge dream of a
hunger free world to reality.
   
 Risks & Challenges 
Our biggest challenge will be to overcome the "" skepticism and too good to be true attitude"" that has encompassed many in the international community when we introduce new technologies- much like the cell phone and the internet.
In order to mitigate this challenge we have  made arrangements with the University of the Cape Coast in Ghana to certify the trials for   the aquaculture system; the University of Ghana  and the University of Nairobi for the agriculture systems and with World Vision in northern Kenya for water purification and conservation.
    Other Ways You Can Help
If you can help financially - THANK YOU. But there are many others ways that  we can use your  help.
1) If you believe in a technological solution to severe world problems and have ideas of how technology can be applied- please tell us. We may even retain you to help us develop your idea.
2) Tell you friends and colleagues who might be  able to contribute financially or with great ideas . 
3) Help us with this  and other campaigns. What are we doing right ? What are we doing wrong?  Your opinion and advise will help us do better. Thank you.
4) Use your savvy of social network and help us get the word out. Tell us what you are doing or what you think we should be doing and we will work with you.

<p><b>Making A
Difference! </b></p>
<p>In the United States, the average inpatient stay for a
person with a Spinal Cord Injury is 29 days. The average age of spinal cord
injuries is 16-30 years old. Young people just starting their careers, families,
with their lives in front of them. Most are sent to nursing facilities with no
hope of recovery if family members are not able to care for them around the
clock. Most will never recover to the point they can live independently without
therapy. There are approximately 1.2 million
people living with spinal cord injuries (SCI) in the United States and in the
US, every 48 seconds, a person becomes paralyzed. These are staggering
statistics. Without hope of therapy opportunities, these individuals have little
quality of life. Help me offer the best therapy options available to those with
disabilities in the Tampa Bay area. Nothing like this in our area exists for
the hundreds of Spinal Cord Injured and others with neurological disorders. YOU
can make a difference! </p>
<p>My existing studio is already up and running and I am seeing
clients with disabilities. . My near fatal experience and poor prognosis for recovery gave me
the wisdom to overcome all obstacles and know that the impossible is a state of
mind. My prior work with clients with true disabilities of substantial degrees
has given me the confidence to move forward with my goals knowing that I CAN
help them overcome their injuries and physical limitations. </p>

Three main pieces of FES equipment needed will cost $163,809.00.
Additional equipment Like the NeuroGym Sit to Stand, the Vibration Plate, All
in One Total Gym, Parallel Bars, Adaptive gloves, wedges, mats, occupational
therapy manipulatives and other adaptive pieces will be necessary to convert my
existing gym to a neurorecovery facility and will cost approximately $50,000. I
want to be able to offer scholarship funding to individuals who desperately
need the rehabilitation and cannot afford the therapy and will use $35,000 to fund
initial scholarships.
Making A
Difference! 
In the United States, the average inpatient stay for a
person with a Spinal Cord Injury is 29 days. The average age of spinal cord
injuries is 16-30 years old. Young people just starting their careers, families,
with their lives in front of them. Most are sent to nursing facilities with no
hope of recovery if family members are not able to care for them around the
clock. Most will never recover to the point they can live independently without
therapy. There are approximately 1.2 million
people living with spinal cord injuries (SCI) in the United States and in the
US, every 48 seconds, a person becomes paralyzed. These are staggering
statistics. Without hope of therapy opportunities, these individuals have little
quality of life. Help me offer the best therapy options available to those with
disabilities in the Tampa Bay area. Nothing like this in our area exists for
the hundreds of Spinal Cord Injured and others with neurological disorders. YOU
can make a difference! 
My existing studio is already up and running and I am seeing
clients with disabilities. . My near fatal experience and poor prognosis for recovery gave me
the wisdom to overcome all obstacles and know that the impossible is a state of
mind. My prior work with clients with true disabilities of substantial degrees
has given me the confidence to move forward with my goals knowing that I CAN
help them overcome their injuries and physical limitations.

Cancer Society recommends annual mammograms for women starting at the age of
40. To ensure that all women have access to quality mammography
for the detection of breast cancer in its earliest, most treatable stages the mammography quality standards act
(MQSA) became law in 1992 and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) enforces
its accreditation and certification.<br/></p><p></p><br/><h4><span></span></h4><h3><span><h4>

<p>Quality assurance
testing of mammography systems is currently performed on a daily or weekly basis and according to manufacturer's recommendations using uniform slabs of
tissue-equivalent plastics with necessary test structures embedded in them known as ""phantoms"" in the field. <br/></p><p></p><p>Recently, a quasi-3D form of
mammography known as tomosynthesis has also entered clinical use, which
provides three-dimensional information of the breast and suppresses tissue
overlap. There is currently no proper quality assurance testing devised for tomosynthesis units and committees of manufacturers and
regulatory organizations as well as researchers in the field are commissioned
with tackling this problem worldwide.</p>

significantly underestimating the sophistication of actual detection tasks. Currently,
there is no anthropomorphic 3D physical breast phantom available commercially. The need for an anthropomorphic and anatomically relevant phantom with
three-dimensional structure is even more pronounced in the case of
tomosynthesis quality assurance testing. <b><br/></b></p><blockquote><h3>
<b>We hope to change this!</b><br/>
</h3></blockquote><h4></h4><p>
</p><p>In addition to regular quality assurance testing, physical
breast phantoms are essential for the development, optimization, and clinical
evaluation of new and emerging patient-specific 3D x-ray breast imaging
systems. These phantoms are used for various tests such as system
characterization, reconstruction evaluation, cross-platform comparisons, and
dosimetry to name a few. They should ideally be capable of serving as the ground
truth for purposes such as virtual clinical trials, which are less costly and
time consuming than clinical trials and eliminate the irradiation of the
population.</p>

This campaign is set up to raise funds to support the team's developments through the summer part of the competition. 
                               

 Annual imaging for breast cancer screeningThe American
Cancer Society recommends annual mammograms for women starting at the age of
40. To ensure that all women have access to quality mammography
for the detection of breast cancer in its earliest, most treatable stages the mammography quality standards act
(MQSA) became law in 1992 and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) enforces
its accreditation and certification.
Quality assurance of the imaging systems
Quality assurance
testing of mammography systems is currently performed on a daily or weekly basis and according to manufacturer's recommendations using uniform slabs of
tissue-equivalent plastics with necessary test structures embedded in them known as ""phantoms"" in the field. Recently, a quasi-3D form of
mammography known as tomosynthesis has also entered clinical use, which
provides three-dimensional information of the breast and suppresses tissue
overlap. There is currently no proper quality assurance testing devised for tomosynthesis units and committees of manufacturers and
regulatory organizations as well as researchers in the field are commissioned
with tackling this problem worldwide.

What's missingThe uniform phantoms are far from representing a realistic breast background, hence
significantly underestimating the sophistication of actual detection tasks. Currently,
there is no anthropomorphic 3D physical breast phantom available commercially. The need for an anthropomorphic and anatomically relevant phantom with
three-dimensional structure is even more pronounced in the case of
tomosynthesis quality assurance testing. 
We hope to change this!

In addition to regular quality assurance testing, physical
breast phantoms are essential for the development, optimization, and clinical
evaluation of new and emerging patient-specific 3D x-ray breast imaging
systems. These phantoms are used for various tests such as system
characterization, reconstruction evaluation, cross-platform comparisons, and
dosimetry to name a few. They should ideally be capable of serving as the ground
truth for purposes such as virtual clinical trials, which are less costly and
time consuming than clinical trials and eliminate the irradiation of the
population.

Our solutionOur physical
breast phantoms are generated from the extended cardiac-torso (XCAT) virtual breast
phantoms, which were segmented from human subject dedicated breast computed
tomography data. High-resolution multi-material 3D printing technology is used
to fabricate the physical breast phantoms. Multiple prototype variations are
fabricated and tested.              
The mammographic projections and tomosynthesis
reconstructed images of the fabricated phantoms show great improvement over
available phantoms, presenting a more realistic breast background.                         Our prototype
physical breast phantoms have raised a huge interest in the community. They
have been introduced at several international technical conferences, and are
constantly being examined by regulatory organizations in the US and Europe. 
Why we need your help

In order to further
improve upon our phantoms, we need to develop custom materials that will better represent the x-ray attenuation properties
of tissue.
We also envision creating customizable libraries of phantoms with breast size and density variations, tumors and microcalcifications, and potentially contrast agent absorption. We need capital to make these happen and advance our prototypes to clinical and research application. With your help we can a get jump start, fund our developments through the summer, create necessary partnerships, and advance our market analysis. 
Who we areWe are a team of engineering students at Duke University. Our team has advanced to the second round of Duke Startup Challenge among the top student teams. Our team works with advisers in engineering, science, medicine, and business.

<p><strong>Anithos Greek Organic and Reserve Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil</strong></p>
<p><em>Brought to you by Minghelli Imports </em></p>
<p><strong>The Reason We Started Minghelli Imports and the Anithos Brand </strong></p>
<p>Minghelli Imports and the brand Anithos was formed with the idea of bringing the highest quality authentic Greek olive oil to the United States. This idea came from the reality that there is an incredible number of diluted and mixed olive oils on the market. Whether you are shopping in your local fine foods store, grocery store or enjoying a dish at your favorite restaurant, you will find olive oils that claim to be 100% olive oil but in reality are not.</p>
<p><img alt=""choices"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://minghelliimports.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/1.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""choices""/>                       </p>
<p>Nearly half of all olive oil sold in the United States is ""cut"" with vegetable oils. These deceptions can lead to flavorless, bland and unsafe olive oils. There have even been cases of severe allergic reactions caused by olive oils that contained flower, vegetable or nut oils. Along with these oils, brands are also “cutting” their olive oil with genetically modified canola, soy, cottonseed and corn oils. There are currently no genetically modified olives in production, so customers wishing to avoid those ingredients often look to olive oil as a healthy alternative but may end up unknowingly buying genetically modified products anyway.</p>
<p><img alt=""fats"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://minghelliimports.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/2.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""fats""/> </p>
<p>These less than authentic oils are a pallet and health hazard. They are also being marketed to consumers as premium or even reserve olive oils for a premium and not so reserved price! These olive oils are also being touted as phytonutrient and anti-oxidant rich, heart healthy and cholesterol lowering. Such diluted olive oils may not have these healthy benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Why We Need Anithos Olive Oil</strong></p>
<p>As self-proclaimed foodies and lovers of olive oil, we have gone to so many stores and restaurants and have been underwhelmed by the olive oil we purchased or used. As Mediterranean people, we have had a love for olive oil inherited from thousands of years of cultivation and culture. Now as residents of Tucson, Arizona, we want to bring those traditions with us and better yet, help America experience them too!</p>
<p>As olive oil purists, we always look for authentic Greek olive oil from the regions we know have the best quality, the best production methods and some of the oldest orchards in the world. We were sorry to see that our local stores, and even the farmers markets carried very few if any, single harvest, organic, certified Greek olive oils. The reason for this is because much of Greece’s olive oil is sold to Italy and Spain to be diluted with other olive oils or vegetable oils and sold to the US after more processing and mixing.</p>
<p>With our brand Anithos, we seek to bring 100% single harvest, first cold pressed olive oil, from ancient Koroneiki olive groves, hand-picked by people who take great pride in their orchards and their production methods. The same people who only want to create the very best and who are excited to extend their skills to a market that truly cares about authentic olive oil.</p>

<p>Anithos organic extra virgin olive oil is certified by the USDA to be 100% organic. It is also certified by the European Union and the FDA. It has a much lower acidity level than blended olive oils which typically have a level of 1.5%. Anithos also has a much lower acidity level than most single olive varieties which typically have an acidity level around 0.8%.</p>
<p>Anithos organic extra virgin olive oil has an acidity of 0.35% and the organic reserve extra virgin olive oil has an acidity of less than 0.25%. These low levels of acidity create a unique and excellent flavor. In the international tasting competitions in Italy, olive oils from this orchard have come up as one of the top three organic extra virgin olive oils in the world.</p>
<p><img alt=""olive oil chart"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://minghelliimports.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/5.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""olive oil chart""/> </p>
<p>The prized orchards that produce such pure and flavorful olives are located in southern Greece, in the prefecture or county of Messina in the Kalamata region and are made up of 100 acres with 2.000 olive trees. They have been deemed by the European Union as a‘Protected Designation of Origin’ or a PDO.</p>
<p>A PDO refers to olive oils with ""exceptional properties and quality derived from their place of origin as well as from the way of their production.” The certification of PDO products enables the use of acknowledged special markings, which warranty full compliance with Community and National Legislation requirements.

<p><strong><em>How Do You Know You Have a Quality Olive Oil?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The key factors in dictating whether or not an olive oil is extra virgin are as follows:</em></strong></p>
<p>·Olives should be pressed within 16 hours of being picked.</p>
<p>·Olive oil must have a free acidity level of .8 grams for every 100 grams or less.</p>
<p>·Olive oil must be produced only by mechanical means, no use of solvents or chemicals.</p>
<p>·During production, the oil must not exceed 86°F (30°C)</p>
<p><strong><em>Other factors include:</em></strong></p>
<p>·Knowing where the olive comes from</p>
<p>·If it is from multiple harvests or multiple types of olive</p>
<p>·If it has been mixed with any other kinds of olive oils or vegetable oils</p>
<p>·If it is organically grown and how it is harvested</p>
<p><strong><em>Anithos Premium Reserve Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil</em></strong></p>
<p>Each year, a special crop of olives are harvested for the Reserve Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Reserve olive oil is made from the finest estate Koroneiki olives using a single cold extraction process. It is unique among the premier olive oils of the world due to the microenvironment in which the olives are produced. The estate is located at an elevation of 400 meters, the trees are over 400 years old and the unique soils where these special trees thrive, receive only natural water. This special product of nature produces high polyphenol content in our olive oil. Polyphenols are powerful antioxidants and contain anti-inflammatory nutrients. The result is a source of health and well-being for both nutrition and longevity. In addition, the oil has an exquisite richness with a balanced fruit essence and a hint of wild green almond. The hint of almond flavor is a result of wild almond trees which grow on the estate.</p>

<p><strong>Our Mission and Request</strong></p>
<p>Our mission is to bring this great organic and organic reserve extra virgin olive oil from Greece to the US, at a reasonable price for superior quality and taste. We are seeking the assistance of the Indiegogo community to help us make our dream come true by funding $75k for the bottling, labor, import fees, value added tax, transportation, marketing and nationwide distribution of the first 10 tons of the current stock, to the US.</p>
<p>Ideally, we would love to raise enough funds to bring at least 20 tons of the olive oil at the cost of $150k. To bring the entire stock of 40 tons of organic and 10 tons of the organic reserve to the US, it would cost $314k. This includes all of the bottling, shipping, labor, import fees, value added tax, transportation, marketing and distribution, so any money above the $75k will be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Once the quantity of Anithos olive oil arrives in the US, the first phase and this Indiegogo project will be complete. We will then distribute the products using avenues such as <a href=""http://Amazon.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Amazon.com</a> and direct sales to restaurants and small business food stores. The next phase will include using the profits to fund next season’s harvest and shipping of the olive oil to the US. This year, we will be looking for companies in the US to bottle and label our olive oil.</p>
<p><strong>Risks and challenges </strong></p>
<p>As we all know, every project comes with unexpected delays or problems. We are, of course, hoping to avoid these things but in the event that we have a delay or set-back, we are fully prepared to use all of our available resources to remedy them.</p>
<p>Minghelli Imports has a strong team who will be using their social networks, their family resources and their experience in business and e-commerce to help this project succeed! We also have great connections with our team in Greece, who are prepared to help us in any way they can to bring this wonderful olive oil to the US! We are hoping for a smooth shipment process from Greece to the US and have taken all the necessary steps to insure that the olive oil is certified, FDA approved and ready to pass customs. We have also taken the steps to secure all necessary codes, labels and documents to be able to sell and distribute the olive oil right away.</p>
<p>The rewards for our backers will be delivered first upon a successful project. Then we will concentrate on Amazon.com and other retail areas!

<h3 class=""Heading1"">About Me</h3>
<p>My name is Troy Jungjohann; I’m 45 years old and was diagnosed with Stage IV Colorectal cancer with metastasis to my liver in September of 2009.  I served in the United States Air Force from 1987-2000, where I picked up the nickname of Jungleman, and it has stuck with me ever since.  I currently work as a IT Systems Administrator at St. John’s Hospital in Springfield, IL. </p>
<p>I’ve been married to my soul mate Valerie for the past 24 years and I have three of the most beautiful daughters a guy could ask for, both inside and out!  Elodie is 22 years old and will be completing her nursing degree in December.  Stefani is 17 years old and will be a senior in High School and is a member of the National Honor Society.  Emilie will be 14 in September and has a great sense of humor and I suspect will seek a performing arts major when college rolls around.  She loves the having spotlight on her!</p>
<span style="""">I love to cook, but have not spent alot of time doing it lately because sometimes the smell of food nauseates me. Before being diagnosed, I loved playing volleyball and golf, but haven't been able to play either lately. I've taken up photography in the past 10 years and my favorite photos are of landscape and architecture and prefer night photography.</span>
<h3 class=""Heading1"">Why this campaign is important to me</h3>
<p>The reason I'm putting this campaign together, is to help ensure my wonderful wife Valerie has a small savings account with enough money to bridge the gap between my salary no longer being there and life insurance being paid out.  This includes paying for funeral expenses and any unforeseen medical costs.  Sure, I have medical and life insurance, through my employer, which has been great.  But life insurance is something I never put much thought towards, until I was diagnosed.  At the age of 42 I really thought I’d live forever and have my health.  Who doesn’t at that age!</p>
<p>That horrible day in September 2009, everything came crashing down!  I was told to get my affairs in order because I only had 3-6 months.  I am still here after nearly three years!  I was referred to University of Texas, MD Anderson for a liver resection.  Several trips to the Houston Medical District produced a lot of travel and hotel expenses and two failed surgery attempts.  One because my liver was toxic from the chemotherapy and proceeding with the surgery would have caused liver failure and I would have passed away.  The second surgery was cancelled because the doctors found small spots in my lungs, meaning the cancer was spreading.  My team of Doctors and Nurses have been awesome and have kept me going so I can spend as much time with my family as possible. </p>
<p>Two months ago, I was informed that I had exhausted all federally approved chemotherapy regimens.  I was referred to Jefferson City, MO for an Early Acceptance Program (Post Phase three clinical trial, waiting on the FDA to approve) of the drug Regorefenib.  This has given my family and I Hope once again that we can win the waiting game and the medical community will find a cure.  </p>
<p>I have a lot of fight in me, but I’m non-operational, and therefore terminal.  Obtaining additional life insurance after a diagnosis such as this is impossible.  My wife and three daughters mean the world to me, and I hate to think of how life for them will be without me.  I hate to think they are going to have to grieve all alone, which is unthinkable because I’m usually the calming force. </p>
<p>The VA claims I make too much money for any benefits.  While in the Air Force I made enough money to cover my expenses and bills, but at the end of the month we never seemed to have enough left over to put into a savings or additional life insurance.  That’s why I’m creating this Indiegogo campaign to humbly and graciously ask people for their donations. </p>
<p class=""Body1"">Receiving your donations will allow me opportunity to enjoy the remaining time I have with my family, by having the peace of mind to know that my family will have this nest egg.  The money raised here will definitely help financially, but the fact still remains, I won't be there to help them emotionally or mentally once I leave this earth. </p>
<h3 class=""Heading1"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p class=""Body1"">The funds collected bridge the gap between my salary stopping and life insurance kicking in.  The generously and graciously donated to my campaign will also be used for funeral arrangements.</p>

My name is Troy Jungjohann; I’m 45 years old and was diagnosed with Stage IV Colorectal cancer with metastasis to my liver in September of 2009.  I served in the United States Air Force from 1987-2000, where I picked up the nickname of Jungleman, and it has stuck with me ever since.  I currently work as a IT Systems Administrator at St. John’s Hospital in Springfield, IL. 
I’ve been married to my soul mate Valerie for the past 24 years and I have three of the most beautiful daughters a guy could ask for, both inside and out!  Elodie is 22 years old and will be completing her nursing degree in December.  Stefani is 17 years old and will be a senior in High School and is a member of the National Honor Society.  Emilie will be 14 in September and has a great sense of humor and I suspect will seek a performing arts major when college rolls around.  She loves the having spotlight on her!
I love to cook, but have not spent alot of time doing it lately because sometimes the smell of food nauseates me. Before being diagnosed, I loved playing volleyball and golf, but haven't been able to play either lately. I've taken up photography in the past 10 years and my favorite photos are of landscape and architecture and prefer night photography.

place! That is why we put our hearts and souls into this work.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h2><b>Story:</b></h2><p>Sometimes I would start working out at the gym, and it seemed like once and for all.The first two such attempts were futile, because I didn’t know how to train and track my progress.But the third time I decided to tackle this matter from a different angle.I spent a few months studying nutrition science and body structure and only after that I went to the gym to achieve specific results.After some time I decided to keep track of my diet and exercise.For this purpose I started looking for a suitable application. I downloaded about a dozen applications and even paid for some of them, but every time I ended up with a pencil and paper calculating the results myself.And then an idea struck me: “what if”!I spent a couple of the following months developing this idea. As a result, in the beginning of 2013 I started writing down everything required for such a unique application and also found companions, who helped me create this project.</p><p><br/></p>
<p>
</p><h3><b>What
We Need &amp; What You Get:</b></h3>

<p>The
screen of your mobile device is filled with shortcuts.</p>
<p>You
have to switch back and forth between applications, some of which you
must pay for. All of these manipulations are very confusing and
inconvenient.</p>

“FitTheLand”
is a unique application for your body, which will support and
motivate you step by step, helping you to change and improve
yourself. This stylish and user-friendly application will be your
essential partner and assistant on the way to achieve your goals.  


Application
will help you make a suitable and well-balanced diet plan according
to your objectives. “FitTheLand” will always remind you when to
eat, as well as keep a watchful eye on what you eat!

Track
your physical activity.
“FitTheLand”
conveniently offers you various levels of training programs:
Beginner, Amateur and Professional.
You
can create workouts for various purposes (weight loss, muscle
building and retention) and various places (home, outdoors or gym).
Our library consists of a wide range of exercises for different
muscle groups together with correct and complete information on how
to perform them.

Application
will mark your advancement and achievements with special rewards.

“FitTheLand”
is both your personal trainer and dieting expert. Apart from personal
recommendations this application will suggest the nearest gyms and
sport nutrition stores, wherever you might be.

What contributors will help you achieve:
We
don’t want to make just another fitness app.
Our
goal is to make the application, which would be large-scale, truly
engaging, motivating and giving people self-condidence!
We
want to encourage everyone to live a healthy lifestyle and exercise
regularly.
We
are driven by our desire to develop what we care for.
This
is a very important mission not just for us, but also for the whole
sports community! People have to be strong, healthy, successful and
look into the mirror with pride!
We
are confident that this application will make the world a better
place! That is why we put our hearts and souls into this work.Story:Sometimes I would start working out at the gym, and it seemed like once and for all.The first two such attempts were futile, because I didn’t know how to train and track my progress.But the third time I decided to tackle this matter from a different angle.I spent a few months studying nutrition science and body structure and only after that I went to the gym to achieve specific results.After some time I decided to keep track of my diet and exercise.For this purpose I started looking for a suitable application. I downloaded about a dozen applications and even paid for some of them, but every time I ended up with a pencil and paper calculating the results myself.And then an idea struck me: “what if”!I spent a couple of the following months developing this idea. As a result, in the beginning of 2013 I started writing down everything required for such a unique application and also found companions, who helped me create this project.

What
We Need & What You Get:
Owing
to your contribution to our idea we will be able to hire a
professional mobile application development studio, which will put
all of our ideas into life.
All
donations will go to development, enhancement and initial support of
the application.
Our
goal is $151.500 and we understand that it’s quite a lot of money but
that’s the price we have to pay in order to implement all the
intended functionsPerks:

Сollector’s T-shirt
- The online store will be sold 15 unique design t-shirts with different themes (Cities ""art style"")
Collectible t-shirts that you get for your contribution have a limited series, will be released only once.
A special reward in the trophy room
- The application will present a section where everyone can receive awards for their achievements (For example, if you run 500 miles there will be new achievements in the trophy room)
- All contributors will be given a unique rewards 1 through level 7, depending on the deposit amount




Plan:



Describe
where the funds go if you don't reach your entire goal:
In
case we fail to achieve our target goal, we will work towards a
gradual creation of the app one step at a time
Explain
why your project is valuable to the contributor and to the world:
Currently
you have to download many fitness applications, count calories, set
timers, do exercise, search for recipes, etc.
The
screen of your mobile device is filled with shortcuts.
You
have to switch back and forth between applications, some of which you
must pay for. All of these manipulations are very confusing and
inconvenient.

<p>We treat everyone from infants to the elderly for acute and chronic

invasive, risky medical procedure and recognize the wisdom in exploring 
other options  first. Given that holistic medicine looks “outside the box”
—taking into consideration the entirety of possible influences in a 
person’s illness— we are especially skilled at supporting challenged 
patient populations, such as children with developmental issues. We have a

not have the means (approximately half of our treatment hours are pro

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Hi – thanks for taking the time to read my story.<span style="""">  </span>My name is Emory Moe, although most people simply call me Emo.<span style="""">  </span>I’m a musician from San Diego, California.<span style="""">  </span>I recently underwent open heart surgery to repair a valve in my heart.<span style="""">  </span>The surgery was successful, and I’m very grateful to be alive, however my out-of-pocket expenses have been exorbitant.<span style="""">  </span>This is compounded by the fact that I haven’t been able to perform since mid-December, and as a musician this means I have had no income whatsoever.<span style="""">  </span>Simply put, when musicians don’t show up to play, they don’t get paid.<span style="""">  </span>Going without any source of income is non-sustainable just for normal living expenses, but it’s the medical expenses that have prompted me to ask for your help.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I’ve had to go into debt to pay all these bills, but because I’m not a greedy person, and I’d always prefer to pay my own way in life, I’m only asking for about half of what my medical expenses are.<span style="""">  </span>Whether I exceed my goal or don’t reach it, every penny raised will go towards those outstanding bills.<span style="""">  </span>My surgery took place at the end of December, and my 8-day hospital stay extended into the first week of January.<span style="""">  </span>What that means is that the deductible on my insurance had to be met twice, once for each year.<span style="""">  </span>I’ve had to carry a very high deductible in an effort to make my premiums more affordable.<span style="""">  </span>(“Affordable” and “Medical Insurance Premiums” are definitely conflicting terms!)<span style="""">  </span>It’s been especially difficult not being able to earn any income this year.<span style="""">  </span>In California, unemployment benefits and disability insurance are unavailable to the self-employed.<span style="""">  </span></p>

<p><span class=""notranlsate""></span></p></div>","Hi – thanks for taking the time to read my story.  My name is Emory Moe, although most people simply call me Emo.  I’m a musician from San Diego, California.  I recently underwent open heart surgery to repair a valve in my heart.  The surgery was successful, and I’m very grateful to be alive, however my out-of-pocket expenses have been exorbitant.  This is compounded by the fact that I haven’t been able to perform since mid-December, and as a musician this means I have had no income whatsoever.  Simply put, when musicians don’t show up to play, they don’t get paid.  Going without any source of income is non-sustainable just for normal living expenses, but it’s the medical expenses that have prompted me to ask for your help.
 
I’ve had to go into debt to pay all these bills, but because I’m not a greedy person, and I’d always prefer to pay my own way in life, I’m only asking for about half of what my medical expenses are.  Whether I exceed my goal or don’t reach it, every penny raised will go towards those outstanding bills.  My surgery took place at the end of December, and my 8-day hospital stay extended into the first week of January.  What that means is that the deductible on my insurance had to be met twice, once for each year.  I’ve had to carry a very high deductible in an effort to make my premiums more affordable.  (“Affordable” and “Medical Insurance Premiums” are definitely conflicting terms!)  It’s been especially difficult not being able to earn any income this year.  In California, unemployment benefits and disability insurance are unavailable to the self-employed.  
 
Please check out the perks I’m offering, below.  My offering to the world is my music, and my offering to you as a contributor to my campaign is also my music.  My main gig is as the bass player and vocalist for the classic rock band; The Brokers Band.  (www.thebrokersband.com)  This is a bunch of guys who happen to be great musicians in addition to truly wonderful people.  Throughout my ordeal, including several months of being disabled, they have saved my position in the band.  We’re now making plans for my comeback as soon as I’m able, and we’re all very much looking forward to that day.  In addition to my commitment to The Brokers Band, I play classical guitar for quieter, mellower events.  (www.emotheguitarguy.homestead.com)
 
Besides having a good bunch of guys in my band, I also have some wonderful friends who are organizing a fundraiser for me.  This will be on June 1, 2013 at Larry’s Beach Club in Oceanside, California.  There is sure to be some great entertainment, a silent auction, raffles, etc.  I’m truly honored that among the performers will be Roni Lee, Mojo Nixon, Joey Harris and the Mentals, Samz Jam, Third Degree, and the Decades, in addition to The Brokers Band.  Comedian L.G. Brown is set to MC the event.  If you are able to attend, I will certainly be honored by your presence.
 
If you are able to contribute anything at all, I will be extremely grateful.  Every penny will relieve the mountain of debt I have accrued.  Whether you are able to contribute or not, please consider passing the word along to others using the share buttons below, sending email, word of mouth, or any means at your disposal.  Every effort will be fully appreciated.
 
Thank you so much for your time and effort on my behalf.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions at haveaheartforemo@gmail.com.  Bless you all!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

mission to show the world what Nordic Food is all about so that everyone can make it at home. </i><br/></p><p>Within the last couple
of years, The restaurant NOMA in Copenhagen has three times been awarded the
best restaurant in the world serving only Nordic food, but few people know how to cook
Nordic food in their own homes. We are sure that most people sometimes want to
eat something healthy for dinner, but have too little time to prepare it at
home, buy the groceries and so on. <br/></p><p>If you are anything like we are, there is just not enough
time during a busy week for cooking a decent and healthy meal for you and your
family. But if you did in fact have the time, we are sure you would like to do
it, and that you would feel sooo much better if it was a healthy and delicious
meal that you could even share with your friends and family. </p>
<p>Everybody should have a chance to enjoy life a bit
more and stop stressing about cooking at home. We are here to introduce the
world to the easy and healthy ways of Nordic home cooking with a new exiting
Nordic Internet platform called Karla’s Nordic Kitchen. </p>
<p>Please help us show the world that we are here, so
that we can all eat better food every day and have fun while doing it.</p>
<p><b>Project Information:</b></p>
<p>In august of 2011, Karla won
the National Danish championship of Home Cooking. Shortly afterwards she went
online with her Danish food blog called <a href=""http://www.juliekarla.dk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.juliekarla.dk</a>. Now, Karla has been writing about
Nordic food for almost three years, and collected a lot of knowledge about the
Nordic Kitchen and the best local recipes. She is ready to share this knowledge
with the world on an international food and recipe website, so everyone can try
it out at their homes.</p>
<p>We’re seeking <b>1500</b> dollars to launch the website
internationally, which will give us a chance to introduce the whole world to a
healthier way of life while eating delicious Nordic food. We have spend all our
money making most of the website functional, but people need to know it’s out
there, and we need to make it welcoming for all the visitors for it to really
work. </p>
<p><b>The 1500 dollars we are
seeking will be spend directly on a campaign for the website. Our goal is to
have 100.000 monthly visitors before New Years Eve 2014.</b></p>
<p>The website is called <a href=""http://www.karlasnordickitchen.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.karlasnordickitchen.com</a> and has been under construction for some time now and we are almost
ready to launch it internationally and we really need all the financial helping
hands we can find to let the world know it is out there. We want everybody to have
a chance to eat healthier food and find out why The Nordic Kitchen has become
so popular. </p>
<p><b>Why the Nordic Kitchen?</b> The
best restaurant in the world is called Noma and serves only Nordic food based
on Nordic Ingredients. The Nordic countries are in fact packed with Michelin
restaurants and some of the best chefs in the world are the Nordic chefs. Generally
and all the Nordic countries are doing a great job at serving some of the most
nutritious food in the world. It’s low carb, high protein, organic, and loaded
with vitamins. Most people are not familiar with the Nordic kitchen and have no
chance of cooking all these amazing and simple dishes at home, and we wanna do
something about that.</p>
<p>The Nordic Kitchen may seem
very innovative, but the overall philosophy is actually to use ancient ways of
cooking dating back to the times of the Vikings, to make simple and very tasty
food that everyone can make. And it’s based on organic and very healthy
ingredients such as lamb, salmon, game and fresh berries.</p>
<p><b>The Karla’s Nordic Kitchen
campaign will promote the site all over the Internet and we will upload as many
Nordic recipes as we possible can</b>. <br/></p><p>Our ambition is to create a solid platform
of permanent readers and fans; so that once the site is launched it will stay
online and will become and remain a great place for all to come and visit
online. We will do our best to get the
information out there for all to find. We will fight for healthy organic foods
made from the best ingredients we can find, and we will make Karla’s Nordic
Kitchen the talk of the town. </p>
<p>We will give people a
chance to sign up for the recipes, to share our recipes with their friends, and
we will fill the site with all the best pieces of dining and eating advice we
can find for everyone visiting. <span></span></p>
<p>We will continuously strive
to include every reader we can find in the cooking adventure, and we will try
to make a website, which is accessible for all.</p>
<p><b>We want our visitors to the
website to leave:</b></p>
<p>• Knowing more about the Nordic
Kitchen • being able to apply the recipes in their own home cooking • being
ready try out the best Nordic food when visiting any of the Nordic countries</p>
<p><b>We have several goals for
the campaign:</b></p>
<p>• Introduce the world to
the Nordic Kitchen • Reaching a 100.000 monthly impressions within 5 months • Helping
people cook more healthy food in their busy lives that leaves them with too little time to
try cooking at home • Create a free printable Nordic cooking calendar available
for free download at the site.</p>
<p>We need $1,500 to build and
launch the campaign. <br/></p><p><b>The Website &amp; Launch Budget is:</b></p>
<p>$200: creating a free
Printable calendar and download option coding. $800: Search engine
optimization. $200: Domain and server administration. $100: Hosting. $200:
Facebook advertisements. $100: Enhance website design for traffic <br/></p><p>__________________________________
Total: $1,500 </p>
<p>Your support will help us
begin our journey and provide everyone with a chance to try Nordic food in
their own homes.</p>

a chance to eat healthier food and find out why The Nordic Kitchen has become
so popular. 
Why the Nordic Kitchen? The
best restaurant in the world is called Noma and serves only Nordic food based
on Nordic Ingredients. The Nordic countries are in fact packed with Michelin
restaurants and some of the best chefs in the world are the Nordic chefs. Generally
and all the Nordic countries are doing a great job at serving some of the most
nutritious food in the world. It’s low carb, high protein, organic, and loaded
with vitamins. Most people are not familiar with the Nordic kitchen and have no
chance of cooking all these amazing and simple dishes at home, and we wanna do
something about that.
The Nordic Kitchen may seem
very innovative, but the overall philosophy is actually to use ancient ways of
cooking dating back to the times of the Vikings, to make simple and very tasty
food that everyone can make. And it’s based on organic and very healthy
ingredients such as lamb, salmon, game and fresh berries.
The Karla’s Nordic Kitchen
campaign will promote the site all over the Internet and we will upload as many
Nordic recipes as we possible can. Our ambition is to create a solid platform
of permanent readers and fans; so that once the site is launched it will stay
online and will become and remain a great place for all to come and visit
online. We will do our best to get the
information out there for all to find. We will fight for healthy organic foods
made from the best ingredients we can find, and we will make Karla’s Nordic
Kitchen the talk of the town. 
We will give people a
chance to sign up for the recipes, to share our recipes with their friends, and
we will fill the site with all the best pieces of dining and eating advice we
can find for everyone visiting. 
We will continuously strive
to include every reader we can find in the cooking adventure, and we will try
to make a website, which is accessible for all.
We want our visitors to the
website to leave:
• Knowing more about the Nordic
Kitchen • being able to apply the recipes in their own home cooking • being
ready try out the best Nordic food when visiting any of the Nordic countries
We have several goals for
the campaign:
• Introduce the world to
the Nordic Kitchen • Reaching a 100.000 monthly impressions within 5 months • Helping
people cook more healthy food in their busy lives that leaves them with too little time to
try cooking at home • Create a free printable Nordic cooking calendar available
for free download at the site.
We need $1,500 to build and
launch the campaign. The Website & Launch Budget is:
$200: creating a free
Printable calendar and download option coding. $800: Search engine
optimization. $200: Domain and server administration. $100: Hosting. $200:
Facebook advertisements. $100: Enhance website design for traffic __________________________________
Total: $1,500 
Your support will help us
begin our journey and provide everyone with a chance to try Nordic food in
their own homes.

<p>As many of you know, in the past year, I have been inspired to step more fully into my yoga practice. As a positive result, it has allowed me to stay grounded in my mind, body, and spirit throughout this year and to express myself in a more genuine and compassionate way. As I've watched and experienced my practice evolve, I've seen my entire life evolve and benefit as well. I'm extremely grateful for the opportunity for myself, and for all those that benefit from my practice. From that space of gratitude, I am enrolling in a 200 hour yoga teacher training certification program starting in February 2013 in order to deepen my own practice, as well as offer an avenue so that I can effectively share it with others.</p>
<p>While I'm clear that this training is the right transition for me, I'm also aware that I need financial support in order to make it a reality. After talking it over with a mentor of mine, I was inspired to create this Indiegogo campaign as a way to get support from my entire community so that I can choose this opportunity. This is an invitation to become an active participant in the cycle of energy I am engaged in with my practice and this training. As you support me to establish a deeper life-long yoga practice, I can return that gift by teaching yoga and sharing the compassion, joy, and gratitude it allows me to experience.</p>
<p>And supporting me isn't the only amazing gift you get! Because I believe in the equal exchange of energy, I am offering “perks” in exchange for any financial support you feel called to gift me. You may look over the basics of my funding campaign including a list of perks, my fundraising goal, and my fundraising deadline on this webpage.</p>
<p>The biggest perk I have to offer you is my heartfelt gratitude for any support you have to offer me, whether it be financial, energetic, emotional, spiritual, or any form that feels most genuine. As you read this and hold the reality of me as a certified yoga teacher in your thoughts, please know that I am honored and humbled to be connected to such amazing human beings! And I joyfully continue to engage in the constant flow of energy that unites us all as we continue along our respective paths grounded in love and support for one another.</p>

In the last decade (technically 12 years) that we’ve been building apps we’ve focused on a small number of areas: one of which is building websites.

Typed Logo
We’ve also been working on the design and branding for Typed.com - here’s some of the early logo iterations we’ve been through. We haven’t managed to create the perfect logo just yet, but hopefully with your feedback we can create something that perfectly represents Typed.com.




Why we need your help with funding
We’ve spent many months working on Typed.com to get it into a working prototype. We’ve taken the initial concept and ideas, sketched, built wireframes and now have a working prototype, but it’s still a way off of being finished. Your support and funding helps us take everything we’ve built so far, and bring it to life - the funds raised will help pay for the design, development, testing  and the hosting of Typed.comDevelopment Timeline for Typed.comWe'll have a special beta version of Typed.com for backers to use in April. We'll get feedback from you and implement changes and suggestions and follow up with a full public release in late Summer 2015. All backers will get early access ahead of a public release.Rewards & Perks for Your SupportIn return for you support we’ve put together some great rewards and perks, including huge discount, lifetime membership options, and some limited addition swag like T-shirts and stickers.






Technical Details
Typed.com is a Python application built on top of the powerful and robust Django framework. It’s backed by a PostgreSQL database for reliability and performance. Both the application and database will be hosted with Heroku. Choosing Heroku allows us to focus on building an awesome blogging platform for you rather than managing servers. There are lots of other other moving parts that make up Typed which we’re excited to discuss with you in more detail as development progresses, so watch this space.About The TeamWe’re a small team of designers and developers based in Brighton England with many years’ experience shipping world class apps. In the last decade (technically 12 years) that we’ve been building apps we’ve focused on a small number of areas: one of which is building websites. We’ve built (and continue to develop) the pre-eminent app for the Mac - RapidWeaver - and we’re using this expertise to create the best online writing & publishing service in the world.Risks & ChallengesAs with any project, our biggest challenge is shipping Typed.com on time. Software can be notoriously hard to estimate the amount of work required to get it shipping - however, Dan (the Founder) has been building software for over ten years now. We’re confident that with your help we’ll be able to hit the planned release date. FAQI have questions, how can I reach your team?For questions related to the Indiegogo campaign, feel free to email us at indiegogo@realmacsoftware.com. Otherwise, you can always reach us at support@realmacsoftware.com Forever is a long time, can you really host my content forever?As long as we have paying customers, we’ll keep the servers running and the lights on. We want to build a blogging system people can rely on. We’re in this for the long haul, and will be publishing our own blogs with Typed.Will I be able to publish a blog while Typed.com is in beta?Once you get invited to the beta you'll be able to setup and publish your own public blog.Other than contributing, how can I help?You can spread the word about Typed to your friends, family, enemies and co-workers via Twitter, Facebook, email, or any other means. You can find the share links at the top of this page. With your help we can reach our goal!What's the difference between Typed.com and Typed for Mac?I'm glad you asked. Typed is our distraction free markdown based writing app for the Mac. Typed.com is going to be an online blogging platform. Typed for Mac will eventually be able to publish directly to Typed.com - but first we need to finish Typed.com to enable this to happen :)",15.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Sydney. I am a third year student at UC Santa Cruz. Last year I interned for Trudy Rilling-Collins of Mosquito Lady Consulting (mosquitolady.com) teaching local island communities in the Maldives Islands about Dengue Fever and how to implement mosquito control programs. Mosquito control is the non-chemical water source control that prevents mosquitoes from reaching full maturity as winged adults. Source control corresponds to scheduled weekly in-community visits. Maldivian community members volunteer for the position, and maintain mosquito control by placing fish in wells, covering septic tank vents and water tanks, and discarding unnecessary standing water. </p>
<p>During the twelve island survey of the Baa Atoll (a UNESCO Biosphere reserve), Rilling-Collins and I came face to face with communities who had lost young children to Dengue Hemoragic Fever. This project, entirely sponsored by Landaa Giraavaru of the Four Seasons Resort, was integral to understanding how completely these island communities are affected by the blood borne diseases that mosquitoes vector. </p>

<br/><h3>The Next Step</h3>
<p>This year, we are headed back to the Maldives to finish where we left off. After interviewing numerous applicants, a team of six qualified, dedicated, enthusiastic, and brilliant UCSC volunteers will be flying to the Maldive Islands to teach and empower local Maldivians to implement and maintain mosquito control projects.</p>

<p><em> </em></p>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>While volunteers will be sponsored with food and accomodation from Landaa Giraavaru of the Four Seasons Resort, these student volunteers need help with flight costs and incidentals (such as travel insurance, immunizations, etc). In interest of educating the Santa Cruz community about our project, volunteers are asking for 3/4 of their costs, while hoping to raise the remaining 1/4 in community fundraisers. Once we reach our $10,000 goal, all additional funds will go to community development in the Maldives, such as purchasing tools for shredding plastic bottles and plastic containers that catch water. In this tropical environment, these synthetic containers contribute greatly to the mosquito breeding sites on these islands. These will be important tools to help local islanders successfully implement their mostquito control projects.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contributions will have a serious IMPACT! Each of the volunteers you will be funding will be paired with a Maldivian translator to work with different local island. The efforts and collaboration between these UCSC and Maldivian volunteers will be educational and productive culminating in a complete mosquito control project. While Dengue Fever ramains an incurrable disease, the mosquitoes that vector the disease <strong><em>can be controlled. </em></strong></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""><span style=""font-family: Tahoma,sans-serif;"">I am Jan Peter de Jong and have been working together with Jesus Gamarra on the investigations of his father Alfredo Gamarra. For more information about me, see <a href=""http://www.ancient-mysteries-explained.com/janpeterdejong.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.ancient-mysteries-explained.com/janpeterdejong.html</a></span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""><span style=""font-family: Tahoma,sans-serif;""><strong>The video above is our introduction video for the Pythagoras conference 2012</strong></span></p>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<br/>I am launching this campaign to raise funds for Jesus Gamarra, so he can share with the world, his father’s 60 years of research and dedication in his search for answers.<br/>The Pythagoras Conference is Jesus’ chance to present the findings and investigations of his late father, Alfredo Gamarra. The conference will be held from October 10th -14th 2012 in Louisville, Kentucky, USA. This will also be transmitted via the Internet, Globally. The Conference will present speakers from around the world. The main topic of the conference is to present the following subject  - <strong>Breakthroughs in Future Sciences and Spiritual Consciousness.</strong> <br/>See: <a href=""http://www.pythagorasconferenceglobal.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.pythagorasconferenceglobal.com</a> <br/><br/>Jesus Gamarra and I are featured speakers at this Conference along with many researchers. This is an excellent opportunity for Jesus to finally get the attention placed on the discoveries of his father.  Jesus is the one that should be at this conference so his story and voice can be heard. Jesus needs the funds to get there.</div>
<div>
<br/>He has travel expenses and needs a visa and passport. Jesus is low on funding at this time and also has a debt with a publishing company where his last book was printed. The remainder of this debt obliges him to pay $1000 before the remaining books can be released. <br/><br/>If this fund raising campaign achieves its goal, my ticket from Holland (where I live presently) to the USA would be included. This would be a relief. Due to my own continuing efforts to assist Jesus and ensure the evidence reaches the public, I too find myself out of pocket at this time.<br/><br/>Our documentary has just been released on Amazon and hasn't had the chance to cover production costs, yet.  At this time, my main priority is Jesus Gamarra's expenses, to ensure his presence at the conference. If his travel expenses are forthcoming, we can then start to pay the publishing company for the release of his books.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>This is a huge, once in a lifetime opportunity for Jesus Gamarra.</strong> <br/>The Gamarra's have to date, been working solely in their hometown Cusco, Peru and so, the opportunity to spread their theory would not only fascinate the world, but undoubtedly would shed light on many ancient mysteries.<br/><br/>Together with Jesus' own further discoveries and achievements, there is a world of possibilities for further books, documentaries, websites etc.<br/><br/>So, this fund raising campaign is especially directed at catalyzing his work with the holes in our understanding of a past so deep we have just started scratching the surface. The conference means that he will be heard <strong>globally</strong> and millions more of us will know of the work of Alfredo Gamarra and his son Jesus.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Jesus’ father, Alfredo Gamarra, has left material for some <strong>14 books and several documentaries</strong> that still yet, need to be made. He will be able to get back on track by paying the debt to the publishing company, which will produce more books that he can offer. Also this will give him the chance he needs to bring this valuable information into the light. This Conference will make a difference in the way we look at things and what those things will do to make the picture we see clearer.</div>
<div>
<p> </p>
</div>
<p>Funding is needed for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ticket Jesus Gamarra Cusco - Lima - Lima - Cusco for visa : $ 250</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another round ticket Cusco Lima to continue procedure for the visa, so again: $250</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary

I am Jan Peter de Jong and have been working together with Jesus Gamarra on the investigations of his father Alfredo Gamarra. For more information about me, see http://www.ancient-mysteries-explained.com/janpeterdejong.html
The video above is our introduction video for the Pythagoras conference 2012

 

I am launching this campaign to raise funds for Jesus Gamarra, so he can share with the world, his father’s 60 years of research and dedication in his search for answers.The Pythagoras Conference is Jesus’ chance to present the findings and investigations of his late father, Alfredo Gamarra. The conference will be held from October 10th -14th 2012 in Louisville, Kentucky, USA. This will also be transmitted via the Internet, Globally. The Conference will present speakers from around the world. The main topic of the conference is to present the following subject  - Breakthroughs in Future Sciences and Spiritual Consciousness. See: http://www.pythagorasconferenceglobal.com Jesus Gamarra and I are featured speakers at this Conference along with many researchers. This is an excellent opportunity for Jesus to finally get the attention placed on the discoveries of his father.  Jesus is the one that should be at this conference so his story and voice can be heard. Jesus needs the funds to get there.

He has travel expenses and needs a visa and passport. Jesus is low on funding at this time and also has a debt with a publishing company where his last book was printed. The remainder of this debt obliges him to pay $1000 before the remaining books can be released. If this fund raising campaign achieves its goal, my ticket from Holland (where I live presently) to the USA would be included. This would be a relief. Due to my own continuing efforts to assist Jesus and ensure the evidence reaches the public, I too find myself out of pocket at this time.Our documentary has just been released on Amazon and hasn't had the chance to cover production costs, yet.  At this time, my main priority is Jesus Gamarra's expenses, to ensure his presence at the conference. If his travel expenses are forthcoming, we can then start to pay the publishing company for the release of his books.
 

This is a huge, once in a lifetime opportunity for Jesus Gamarra. The Gamarra's have to date, been working solely in their hometown Cusco, Peru and so, the opportunity to spread their theory would not only fascinate the world, but undoubtedly would shed light on many ancient mysteries.Together with Jesus' own further discoveries and achievements, there is a world of possibilities for further books, documentaries, websites etc.So, this fund raising campaign is especially directed at catalyzing his work with the holes in our understanding of a past so deep we have just started scratching the surface. The conference means that he will be heard globally and millions more of us will know of the work of Alfredo Gamarra and his son Jesus.
 
Jesus’ father, Alfredo Gamarra, has left material for some 14 books and several documentaries that still yet, need to be made. He will be able to get back on track by paying the debt to the publishing company, which will produce more books that he can offer. Also this will give him the chance he needs to bring this valuable information into the light. This Conference will make a difference in the way we look at things and what those things will do to make the picture we see clearer.

 

Funding is needed for the following:


Ticket Jesus Gamarra Cusco - Lima - Lima - Cusco for visa : $ 250


Another round ticket Cusco Lima to continue procedure for the visa, so again: $250


Ticket Jesus Gamarra Cusco Lima- Louisville- Louisville Lima- Cusco: $1250


Expenses for stay in Lima, passport, visa, taxis, hotel: $ 250


Expenses for his stay in USA, apart from hotel and food (which is paid for thanks to the inviatation by the Pythagoras Conference): $250


Paying the debt he has with the editorial where his book was published, total of $1000


ticket for myself from Amsterdam to Louisville and back: $1000


Expenses for stay in USA apart from hotel and food (also paid for, thanks to invitation): $250


Total of: $4500 Us dollar

To know more about the work and Discoveries of Alfredo Gamarra, see the ebook that I have written here:
http://www.ancient-mysteries-explained.com/support-files/discoveriesofalfredogamarra.pdf
Jesus and myself have produced a documentary called 'The Cosmogony of the Three Worlds"". You can check it here:

<p>Firstly, I’d like to thank you for checking out my campaign and hopefully you pass it on to your friends and family! People helping people!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>A brief description:</strong></p>
<p>My name is Jamie and I'm currently preparing to run a 250km, 6 stage, 7 day, self-supported foot race through the Gobi Desert this June to raise money and awareness for Prostate Cancer Canada. With only 7 months total to become a runner and train, I am ready to compete in one of the worlds gnarliest and most grueling endurance races in the world.</p>
<p>With the recent loss of my grandfather and witnessing others very close to me go through the harsh trials of Cancer, being able to raise money and awareness for a cancer foundation so close to home emotionally will be a truly gratifying and humbling experience. I purposely chose this endurance race to be my first ever marathon to relate, on a metaphorical level, to the intense and unexpected battle that cancer victim’s experience.</p>
<p>I'm just your average 24 year old city-boy with a big heart trying to make a difference in this world; but I need your help...</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why you should care:</strong></p>
<p>-Can you think of anyone that has NOT experienced cancer in their lives? Me neither…It’s all around us and what triggered me to take on this challenge was when I reached my limit of experiencing and witnessing way too much heartache. Simply put, this is my way of saying ‘cancer, cut that shit out!’</p>
<p>-For me this isn’t about finding the cure…this is about supporting the fight against cancer and spreading the word on preventative measures.</p>
<p>-I believe that in order to make some sort of an impact one must stand out. This is another reason why I chose to enter an ultra-endurance race over a standard marathon in the city…I’m trying to make an impact and my goal has been to turn some heads with such an epic style of race.</p>
<p>-This campaign is important to me because I’m only one person so by you donating and sharing my cause with others hopefully we can kick cancer in the butt!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Please help me get to the starting line!</strong></p>
<p>Why I need your help and where your funds are going:</p>
<p>With your help I’ll be able to cover the majority of my expenses for the race, which will get me to the starting line! If you would prefer to donate to Prostate Cancer Canada then please go here, read my story and make a donation at the bottom of the page :) <a href=""http://www.EndProstateCancer.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.EndProstateCancer.ca</a></p>
<ul>
<li>All of my training gear (becoming a ‘runner’: $1200).</li>
<li>Training supplements (fueling, hydration and recovery.7 months: $1700).</li>
<li>The massive $4000 list of <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">compulsory</span> gear for the race.</li>
<li>Race entry: $3500</li>
<li>Flight: $3400</li>
<li>Inspiring others: Priceless</li>
</ul><p>As you can see, I have spent <strong>A LOT</strong> of money and I’m hoping with your help I can cut it down a bit. I’m looking to raise around $7000 although my expenses have almost reached double that. If you manage to get me over $10,000 I will donate the surplus to the foundation and if I do not reach my goal of $7000 every cent helps and every bit donated will be put towards my race!</p>

<p><strong>How I’ve been training:</strong></p>
<p>Before I began training on November 1<sup>st</sup>, 2012 I was not a runner…zero running experience. Now almost 6 months in I am running 70k weekends with a 20lb pack that I’ll be carrying in the desert. So, how have I managed to become an ultra-runner in less than half a year? A combination of efficient training (which took countless hours of research), nutrition nutrition nutrition (giving my body exactly what it needs in the healthiest forms) and good recovery techniques (sleeping habits, stretching, meditation and nutrition).</p>
<p>During my first 3 months of training I was dealing with a very painful case of patella tendinitis (which is now non-existent)...so for the first 3 months my focus was on recovering from my injury, building strength and increasing my endurance abilities through low impact exercises. I did this through physio therapy, swimming, cycling and some weight training.</p>
<p>If I had to list the 5 training techniques and exercises that have brought me to my current athletic abilities they would be:</p>
<ol><ol><ol>
<li>Sprints and tabatas! Through my research I discovered the most efficient way to increase my endurance, strength as well as my mechanics are through sprint intervals! You reach your max aerobic state at 30 seconds...Therefore doing 30 second sprint repeats will yield much better results than running at a casual pace for hours at a time.</li>
<li>Weighted squats! I cant tell you how many times I’ve received messages from other runners saying “you lift weights?! What the?! Just run man…don’t build muscle…” Squats are so underrated in the endurance world. Not only do they increase your strength in the muscles around your knee but they trigger every main group of muscles in your body and develop perfect running mechanics. I’m 5’11”, 155lbs and squatting 220lbs, this is about building strength and muscle density, not muscle mass.</li>
<li>Kettlebell swings! These have got to be the gnarliest and most effective technique in any type of training. It uses both your aerobic and anaerobic system while you trigger every main muscle group in your body…amazing.</li>
<li>Nutrition!!! Huge thanks to Fresh Restaurants, Pure Health and 3Fuel for helping me out the best they can with meals, vitamins and supplements. And of course my mom for making me eat veggies when I was a kid! Wouldn’t be here without you!</li>
<li>Wicked support group! Running is such a mind game so it’s been vital for me to have a clear and positive head during my long training days. The support of my friends and family have made a huge difference.</li>
</ol></ol></ol><p>Below is what my current training regiment consists of: (insert table)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Future goals:</strong></p>
<p>Training and fundraising for this race has been such a life altering experience and it has inspired me to not only continue training for ultra-marathons but when I return from Asia after this race I will be working on starting a non-for-profit with the mission of inspiring youth at risk through exercise. I have entered another 250k race through Madagascar in August of 2014 so this is really just the beginning for me!</p>

<li class=""back1"">Approximately 20% of competitors run the entire course, 60% combine running with walking, and 20% walk the entire course.</li>
<li class=""back2"">The fastest time on a Gobi March course was in Kashgar in 2012 by Vicente Garcia Beneito with a time of 23 hours and 12 minutes. The fastest women's finish on any Gobi March course is held by Anne-Marie Flammersfeld of Germany, with a time of 27 hours and 53 minutes, also in 2012.</li>
<li class=""back1"">The fastest completion time is expected to be around 24 hours and the slowest around 70 hours.</li>
<li class=""back2"">The Gobi March 2013 is a self-supported race; competitors must carry everything they need for the seven days on their back. The average backpack weighs 8-9 kilograms / 20 pounds.</li>
<li class=""back1"">Up to 200 competitors from more than 40 countries are expected to compete in the Gobi March 2013 with 1/3 of competitors from North America, 1/3 from Asia and 1/3 from Europe.</li>
<li class=""back2"">Many charities are supported through the Gobi March 2013 by competitors. RacingThePlanet supports again the Esquel YL Yang Foundation that focuses on providing education for local children in Xinjiang province.</li>
<li class=""back1"">The average age of the competitors is 38.</li>
<li class=""back2"">Approximately 20% of the competitors are female and 80% are male.</li>
<li class=""back1"">A full medical team works at each race. In addition to treating competitors, the medical team will also be conducting medical research on hypernatremia.</li>
<li class=""back2"">During the Gobi March 2013, competitors, volunteers and staff are expected to consume more than 16,000 liters of water over the seven days of the event.</li>
<li class=""back1"">More than 30 tents are put up daily at each campsite with the help of the local camp team. These tents have been made locally in Xinjiang province.</li>
<li class=""back2"">Competitors are required to pass through up to 30 checkpoints throughout the seven-day event before crossing the finish line.</li>
<li class=""back1"">Each Camp has a special cybertent at where competitors can send and receive emails and update their blogs. </li>

I purposely chose this endurance race to be my first ever marathon to relate, on a metaphorical level, to the intense and unexpected battle that cancer victim’s experience.
I'm just your average 24 year old city-boy with a big heart trying to make a difference in this world; but I need your help...
 
Why you should care:
-Can you think of anyone that has NOT experienced cancer in their lives? Me neither…It’s all around us and what triggered me to take on this challenge was when I reached my limit of experiencing and witnessing way too much heartache. Simply put, this is my way of saying ‘cancer, cut that shit out!’
-For me this isn’t about finding the cure…this is about supporting the fight against cancer and spreading the word on preventative measures.
-I believe that in order to make some sort of an impact one must stand out. This is another reason why I chose to enter an ultra-endurance race over a standard marathon in the city…I’m trying to make an impact and my goal has been to turn some heads with such an epic style of race.
-This campaign is important to me because I’m only one person so by you donating and sharing my cause with others hopefully we can kick cancer in the butt!
 
Please help me get to the starting line!
Why I need your help and where your funds are going:
With your help I’ll be able to cover the majority of my expenses for the race, which will get me to the starting line! If you would prefer to donate to Prostate Cancer Canada then please go here, read my story and make a donation at the bottom of the page :) www.EndProstateCancer.ca

All of my training gear (becoming a ‘runner’: $1200).
Training supplements (fueling, hydration and recovery.7 months: $1700).
The massive $4000 list of compulsory gear for the race.
Race entry: $3500
Flight: $3400
Inspiring others: Priceless
As you can see, I have spent A LOT of money and I’m hoping with your help I can cut it down a bit. I’m looking to raise around $7000 although my expenses have almost reached double that. If you manage to get me over $10,000 I will donate the surplus to the foundation and if I do not reach my goal of $7000 every cent helps and every bit donated will be put towards my race!

How I’ve been training:
Before I began training on November 1st, 2012 I was not a runner…zero running experience. Now almost 6 months in I am running 70k weekends with a 20lb pack that I’ll be carrying in the desert. So, how have I managed to become an ultra-runner in less than half a year? A combination of efficient training (which took countless hours of research), nutrition nutrition nutrition (giving my body exactly what it needs in the healthiest forms) and good recovery techniques (sleeping habits, stretching, meditation and nutrition).
During my first 3 months of training I was dealing with a very painful case of patella tendinitis (which is now non-existent)...so for the first 3 months my focus was on recovering from my injury, building strength and increasing my endurance abilities through low impact exercises. I did this through physio therapy, swimming, cycling and some weight training.
If I had to list the 5 training techniques and exercises that have brought me to my current athletic abilities they would be:

Sprints and tabatas! Through my research I discovered the most efficient way to increase my endurance, strength as well as my mechanics are through sprint intervals! You reach your max aerobic state at 30 seconds...Therefore doing 30 second sprint repeats will yield much better results than running at a casual pace for hours at a time.
Weighted squats! I cant tell you how many times I’ve received messages from other runners saying “you lift weights?! What the?! Just run man…don’t build muscle…” Squats are so underrated in the endurance world. Not only do they increase your strength in the muscles around your knee but they trigger every main group of muscles in your body and develop perfect running mechanics. I’m 5’11”, 155lbs and squatting 220lbs, this is about building strength and muscle density, not muscle mass.
Kettlebell swings! These have got to be the gnarliest and most effective technique in any type of training. It uses both your aerobic and anaerobic system while you trigger every main muscle group in your body…amazing.
Nutrition!!! Huge thanks to Fresh Restaurants, Pure Health and 3Fuel for helping me out the best they can with meals, vitamins and supplements. And of course my mom for making me eat veggies when I was a kid! Wouldn’t be here without you!
Wicked support group! Running is such a mind game so it’s been vital for me to have a clear and positive head during my long training days. The support of my friends and family have made a huge difference.
Below is what my current training regiment consists of: (insert table)
 
Future goals:
Training and fundraising for this race has been such a life altering experience and it has inspired me to not only continue training for ultra-marathons but when I return from Asia after this race I will be working on starting a non-for-profit with the mission of inspiring youth at risk through exercise. I have entered another 250k race through Madagascar in August of 2014 so this is really just the beginning for me!

QUICK FACTS


In 2013 we celebrate the 10th Anniversary of the Gobi March (China)
This special edition of the Gobi March takes place from 2-8 June.
The inaugural Gobi March was held in 2003 and was the first ever 4 Deserts event.
The Gobi March is part of the 4 Deserts series which was named by TIME magazine as the #1 footrace in the world, and as one of the world’s top 10 endurance events.
The Altai Mountains will be the backdrop for the course which takes competitors through alpine scenery with beautiful green grasslands, pristine mountain lakes, river valleys, and villages of ethnic minorities.
The terrain is a mixture of dry, rocky river-beds, dusty tracks, narrow ridge paths, green pastures and some river crossings.
Bole in the Bortala Mongol Autonomous Prefectures of the Xinjiang Province is the host city for the Gobi March 2013. Bortala, which means ""brown steppe"" in Mongolian, shares an international border with Kazakhstan to the north and west and is known for the colorful culture of its Mongol, Kazakh and Uyghur minorities.
Temperatures during the Gobi March can vary greatly – in 2013 average temperatures are expected to range between 15-30°C / 59-86°F during the day and as low as 0°C / 32°F at night.
Approximately 20% of competitors run the entire course, 60% combine running with walking, and 20% walk the entire course.
The fastest time on a Gobi March course was in Kashgar in 2012 by Vicente Garcia Beneito with a time of 23 hours and 12 minutes. The fastest women's finish on any Gobi March course is held by Anne-Marie Flammersfeld of Germany, with a time of 27 hours and 53 minutes, also in 2012.
The fastest completion time is expected to be around 24 hours and the slowest around 70 hours.
The Gobi March 2013 is a self-supported race; competitors must carry everything they need for the seven days on their back. The average backpack weighs 8-9 kilograms / 20 pounds.
Up to 200 competitors from more than 40 countries are expected to compete in the Gobi March 2013 with 1/3 of competitors from North America, 1/3 from Asia and 1/3 from Europe.
Many charities are supported through the Gobi March 2013 by competitors. RacingThePlanet supports again the Esquel YL Yang Foundation that focuses on providing education for local children in Xinjiang province.
The average age of the competitors is 38.
Approximately 20% of the competitors are female and 80% are male.
A full medical team works at each race. In addition to treating competitors, the medical team will also be conducting medical research on hypernatremia.
During the Gobi March 2013, competitors, volunteers and staff are expected to consume more than 16,000 liters of water over the seven days of the event.
More than 30 tents are put up daily at each campsite with the help of the local camp team. These tents have been made locally in Xinjiang province.
Competitors are required to pass through up to 30 checkpoints throughout the seven-day event before crossing the finish line.
Each Camp has a special cybertent at where competitors can send and receive emails and update their blogs.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Lena...My 9 year old niece Rachel was diagnosed with leukemia this past June at the Childrens Hospital in Boston.  This news has been absolutely devastating to the family.</p>
<p>Rachels parents were self employed running a small business  when  9 year old daughter Rachel was diagnosed with cancer. They have not been able to return to work since our Rachel was diagnosed. </p>
<p> Rachels parents  brought her to the Childrens Hospital in Boston for what they  thought was a fractured growth plate in her elbow. Nothing could have ever prepared them for a cancer diagnosis. My sweet shy 9 year old niece  had cancer. the news was devastating and terrifying. Her mom said  she kept wishing she  could wake up from this nightmare.  Rachel and her mother spent 44 days in the hospital.Her mother would not leave her side.  </p>
<p>Rachel is sick most of the time. The Chemo has taken a toll on her little body. Rachel has had bone marrows, lumbar punctures, blood transfusions, platelet transfusions, all of this in addition to her chemo medicines and  constant blood draws. </p>
<p>Rachel had also suffered a punctured lung during a procedure to have her port inserted. This was very painful. She needed to have surgery to have a chest tube inserted and chest xrays twice daily for 2 weeks.Rachel got an infection and has had numerous delays in her treatment. She  has a sensitivity to one of her chemo meds. making it  take longer for her blood counts to recover. She has had to have numerous blood transfusions and just doesn't feel good most of the time. Rachel has had to have an NG tube inserted for nutriton. Some days Rachel is too tired to even get off the couch.   Rachel is a very sweet and shy little girl who since being diagnosed has become very uneasy about being away from her mother even for a short time.  </p>
<p>When Rachel and her mom got home from the hospital the counter was literally piled  with bills. While she  was in the hospital taking care of my niece the rest of the world had gone on. Reality began to set in. All she wanted to do was take care of Rachel who was weak and nauseas all of the time. Her husband had to go back and forth out of State to check on the business when he could  and with being out of work for months and Rachels mom not being able to return to work there is barely any money coming in.  Their  homeowners policy had been cancelled, they are behind on their  mortgage payments the credit cards had been maxed out, They had a 500.00 cell phone bill from making calls while in the hospital. They  started to have bill collectors call and harrass them. The stresses are overwhelming. They are consumed with worry for Rachel and constantly worry about the bills.</p>
<p>  Rachels mother has to be able to focus on Rachel's health, treatments, nurses and appointments. It is overwhelming trying to concentrate on  taking care of Rachel and worrying about  bills they cannot pay.</p>
<p> Rachel's birthday is coming up this month and they would love to take her to a ball game or get her the laptop that she has been asking for.  </p>
<p> For every contribution made I will send out an orange prayers for Rachel rubber leukemia bracelet. It is not much but I want to be able to give something back no matter how small. I would like to thank you for taking the time to read my story. Any contribution would be greatly appreciated. Rachel still has a long road ahead of her. She has about a year and a half to go as long as there are not many more delays. We are looking forward to the days when Rachel is well again!  Until then any help would be so very appreciated. It would make such an impact in our lives.</p>

<h3>About this campaign</h3>
<p>Ashley Melcher is 24 years young.

</ul>
<p>Ashley has been in and out of hospitals more and more frequently for the past few years. The disease only gets worse with time. She's had two ""ports"" placed due to the great amount of IVs that she requires. During her first port placement, her left lung was knicked which caused it to collapse. She recovered, but it has caused a lot of pain in that lung and has left it weaker than the other. She also had to endure 3 embolisms due to the massive bleeding in both lungs. Currently, Ashley has severe pneumonia and is waiting to be placed on a list for a double lung transplant.</p>
<p><strong>Ashley, as well as all other CF patients, require the antibiotic Pulmazyme. There is no generic brand, and there are no alternatives to this medication. There is a $400 copay for less than a month's worth of the medicine. Ashley's insurance, as well as medical assistance, do not cover Pulmazyme. Due to the high cost, and her pharmacy withholding information reguarding her payments, she was unable to afford the medicine for an entire month, which in turn led to the pneumonia. Your contribution will help her to pay for her medicine, as well as pay off her balance at her pharmacy, and depending on her condition getting better or worse, your contribution will go towards a double lung transplant.</strong></p>
<p>When Ashley's not in the hospital, she works as a receptionist at her local SPCA, and spends most of her time with her family and friends. She enjoys concerts, movies, and going to zoos!</p>

<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My name is Tori, and I am a very close friend of Ashley's. I met her 5 years ago, volunteering at the SPCA where she works. I eventually worked there along side her and we formed a very close friendship, very quickly. Ashley is a very loyal and true friend. She has always been there for me, and now it's my turn to be there for her. She means the world to me, as well as her other  friends, her boyfriend, and of course her family. She's a beautiful person with a huge heart, and she's never had the luxury of knowing how it feels to breathe without pain or difficulty. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation has been making great strides in searching for a cure and we believe they are just a few years away. If you can help us help Ashley to fight just a little bit longer, until they find the cure, it would mean literally everything to her, and everyone she's touched in her life.</p>

<p>Our Story:</p>
<p>My brother is a nurse. Ten years ago he told me of a scenario where a geriatric patient managed to burn herself with hot water while getting into the bathtub resulting in 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> degree burns over 60% of her body. Needless to say, when infection set in... my brother's tough guy deamor was gone.</p>
<p>Ever since hearing of her pain and researching the tens of thousands of infants, children and adults who get burned with hot water in the bathtub each year (despite all of the current devices), I wanted to develop a product to help prevent these painful injuries.</p>
<p>In the last ten years we have finally gotten to the last step to confirm the chemical properties of our product. We need to come up with the last $6,000 dollars to pay the Chemists to finish the research. Whatever we don’t get covered, we will scrape together the remainder of our savings and attempt to cover their cost. If our expectations become a reality, we would go for a patent and go directly into production. We would then need approx. $100,000 to actually purchase the needed tooling and start the mass production to help prevent these burns (at this point we would go for a SBL). Additionally, we want to keep this manufacturing (the jobs) in the US.</p>
<p>If this product becomes a reality we will help prevent burns (worldwide) and create jobs for America. If we become successful we look forward to “paying it forward” and bless others with the success that comes with the generosity from the society in which we live.</p>

<p>Imagine a program that does not give a hand out, but rather, a hand up.</p>
<p>Now, think about the potential in providing these veterans such a place to recover while utilizing the natural healing power of horses. Think 'The Horse Whisperer' or 'Buck' and you will have an understanding of the healing powers of Equine Therapy. </p>

<p>This unique collaboration advocates healthier and productive living for our veterans, homeless veterans, and homeless.</p>
<p>This is a holistic approach that fosters deep healing, healthy living, and opportunities  once unavailable to most veterans or homeless. These programs address many issues simultaneously while providing the basic provisions for those most in need.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>OUR APPROACH</strong></p>
<p>Taking a systemic approach in addressing the complex and diverse needs of our veterans and rising homeless population is at the foundation of our collaborative work. Beginning with our homeless veterans, this collection of organizations and individuals has already begun the work to create an environment for rapid healing and recovery.</p>
<p>The majority of the infrastructure for these programs has been completed through volunteer labor donated by volunteers, RHR staff, veterans and the homeless, themselves. </p>
<p>A solar powered campground for our veterans is currently being built, including a kitchen, holding pond and outdoor showers. Ground has been broken and seeds planted in the 6,500 sq.ft Homeless Garden, and the Veteran Equine Therapy corral is nearly complete. A percentage of the food raised will be donated to the Food Bank of Nevada County.</p>
<p>The most critical items that remain to get these program(s) completed and the Veteran’s Village established are the campground showers, kitchen, swimming pond, porta-a-potties and a few more materials for the equine therapy corral.</p>

<p><strong>ABOUT</strong></p>
<p><strong>Homelessness</strong></p>
<p>Homelessness in America, today, is on the rise. This population includes women, families, children, US veterans, and even our own grandparents.</p>
<p>Homelessness is the one issue that affects every corner of our community, whether we directly know a homeless person or not, and the trend isn’t hopeful.</p>
<p>Did you know that 25% of all homeless US veterans are in California? Or that in Nevada County the homeless student population has nearly doubled in just one year? A recent study on Homelessness in America indicated the odds of a youth emancipated-foster case becoming homeless were 1 in 11 in 2012 compared to 1 in 100 in 1994.</p>
<p>What most Americans don’t know is that by simply “managing” homelessness there are hidden costs that are much higher than we ever realized.  Costs have been calculated at a national annual of $45,000-$55,000 per homeless person. This is taking into consideration the hidden county, emergency, court, education, and social costs, just to name a few.</p>
<p>There’s a cowboy saying for this:</p>
<p align=""center"">“First thing you do when you find yourself in a hole is you stop diggin.”</p>
<p>Being homeless doesn’t cost us just in dollars, but in the toll it has on the wellbeing of our citizens and our chances for a healthy future.</p>
<p>We need to stop digging the same hole.</p>
<p>Homeless programs around the nation have shown that by simply proactively investing $15,000 per homeless person per year, homelessness can come to a near end simply by promoting self-dignity through community involvement and support.</p>
<p>The standard approach in dealing with homelessness is not enough and it isn’t sustainable: every person should have access to healthy food, a home, and job opportunities.</p>
<p>The homeless issue is a symptom of a larger ailment, and the solution must go to the heart and root of the matter: a solution that interlinks all aspects of community at a systemic level. That's why we focus on solutions that involve sustainable economic infrastructure resulting in a better way of living.</p>

<p> </p></div>","Imagine providing for our veterans, including homeless vets, a safe place to sleep, to commune, hone skills, grow food, and learn about healthy living while receiving guidance and resources to rebuild their very lives. 
Imagine a program that does not give a hand out, but rather, a hand up.
Now, think about the potential in providing these veterans such a place to recover while utilizing the natural healing power of horses. Think 'The Horse Whisperer' or 'Buck' and you will have an understanding of the healing powers of Equine Therapy. 
It’s about horses healing heroes and so much more.
This is Common Ground: Homeless Garden, Veteran's Village, and Veteran Equine Therapy, tucked into the rolling hills of Northern California at River Highlands Ranch: championed by Joaquin Jacobs; Equine Therapist at Highland Springs Healing Center 501(c)(3), Major Martha Sheppard; The Salvation Army, and Nevada County non-profit; Sierra Roots.
This unique collaboration advocates healthier and productive living for our veterans, homeless veterans, and homeless.
This is a holistic approach that fosters deep healing, healthy living, and opportunities  once unavailable to most veterans or homeless. These programs address many issues simultaneously while providing the basic provisions for those most in need.
 
OUR APPROACH
Taking a systemic approach in addressing the complex and diverse needs of our veterans and rising homeless population is at the foundation of our collaborative work. Beginning with our homeless veterans, this collection of organizations and individuals has already begun the work to create an environment for rapid healing and recovery.
The majority of the infrastructure for these programs has been completed through volunteer labor donated by volunteers, RHR staff, veterans and the homeless, themselves. 
A solar powered campground for our veterans is currently being built, including a kitchen, holding pond and outdoor showers. Ground has been broken and seeds planted in the 6,500 sq.ft Homeless Garden, and the Veteran Equine Therapy corral is nearly complete. A percentage of the food raised will be donated to the Food Bank of Nevada County.
The most critical items that remain to get these program(s) completed and the Veteran’s Village established are the campground showers, kitchen, swimming pond, porta-a-potties and a few more materials for the equine therapy corral.
This is where you come in. We will need your help to accomplish this and we have a detailed budget for you.

Me &amp; My Horse were riding down the road enjoying a nice afternoon after work that day when A White SUV swerved off the road at us scareing my horse. He jumped out of the way And I fell.. I had to be airlifted by helicopter to Shands At University of Florida Teaching hospital. I was in the Shock Trauma Unit there for 7 days. I have a lacerated liver, A fractured Scapula And 3 fractured ribs.</p>
<p>I Have grown up with horses and have been riding all my life, Never have I been injured this bad. Bruised up here and there yes but never to this extent. It is devastating to say the least.</p>
<p>I work full time as a Server/Bartender and was very comfortable with what I Made each week. All my bills were paid However there was not much left over for savings. And YES I do realize now I should have been more Proactive with that. (Hindsight?)</p>
<p>I Have been married for 28 years to my husband David. We have a 22 YO son named Tanner. And We have been raising 2 granddaughters from one of my husbands daughters for 9 years. Courtney who is 19 yo. just moved out on her own and we still have Mackenzie at home who is 11.</p>
<p>My Husband has Acute Kidney Failure and goes to Dialysis 3 times a week. He is on SSI disability Fixed income.  He pays for our rent everymonth which is 875.00. The rest of the living expences i am responsible for and willing pay each month.</p>

<p>These are my basic expences that i pay each month. (1289.00)</p>
<p>I will not be able to Go back to work for 8 weeks minimum because of the liver injury. My job is safe and waiting and I personally cant wait to get back. i love my job and where I work.</p>
<p>I am asking for help with our living expences for the next 2 months. They are the barebones minimum I can get away with paying. I have no savings and literally a zero balance in my checing account from paying all I could for this month.</p>
<p>This is a Very humbling experience to ask for anything. I have worked and paid my way my whole life never asking for anything. I love helping others and do when ever possible but actually asking for help for myself is very difficult but i realize I have to if I want to survive this.  God Bless You All for any help you can provide! </p>

<h3>the DEO story</h3>
<p>stripped: DEO, inspired by the ‘science’ of lip balms &amp; sunscreens, is a <strong>super-effective</strong> deodorant by means of its serious staying power and the patented porous silver* in it.</p>
<p>This DEO is <strong>stripped of all things that are not necessary</strong>; chemicals, fragrances, alcohol, aluminium, salt, baking soda, essential oils, animal testing, etc. DEO is an all natural, vegan, unisex deodorant formulated to keep your underarms – and the like – odour-free.</p>
<p>It is designed to naturally combat bacteria that causes body odour in the first place, instead of just masking it. It is <strong>effective for 2 to 5 days</strong>, even with showers in between, and the active ingredients are all natural and earth-friendly. We don’t compromise on this, and neither should you.</p>
<p>stripped: DEO adheres <strong>effortlessly</strong> by applying a small pea-size amount to your underarms and rubs into your skin without any residue. DEO stays on your skin, not your clothes.</p>
<p><i>*not to be confused with nano or colloidal silver which both have some dubious connotations.</i></p>

<h3>why DEO chose plastic tubes</h3>
<p>Our plastic tubes &amp; caps can be recycled with normal plastic containers and the packaging it gets shipped in are hard-walled kraft paper tubes which effectively, but sustainably, protects it whilst making its way to you across the world.</p>
<p>stripped DEO thought about using biodegradable plastic, but it turned out it’s not as sustainable as you’d think. Biodegradable plastic is as of now extremely hard to recycle and if it ends up in the regular plastic waste stream, it could possibly cause problems for that whole batch which would usually be recycled without any problem.</p>
<p>Sugarcane tubes was also an option. However, it is not readily accessible in South Africa yet, meaning having to import it would just increase the CO2 emissions that you were saving by using them in the first place. Added to this, they are also not biodegradable, so they have to be recycled with plastic in any event.</p>
<p>And lastly, we also considered glass jars but having to take stripped: DEO out with your fingers would result in bacteria getting in contact with the cream and contaminating it, making it a risk to use. We don’t want to take that risk in a mass market, we have to have everyone’s best interests at heart.</p>
<p>We always keep an eye on the latest developments in the bioplastics field, and as soon as there’s a promising invention or readily accessibility to it in South Africa, we’ll be the first to give it a go!</p>

<h3>What We Need the Funding For  </h3>
<p>We have a fully engineered product, working prototypes, and a 
software back-end that's ready to go.  We need your help to take our 
prototype into mass production.</p>
<p>
For us to be able to have these devices manufactured at a price low 
enough to make them affordable, we have to make them in production runs 
of at least 1,000 units.  This is partly due to how electronic assembly 
factories 
operate; it is incredibly expensive to set up an assembly line and buy 
the initial tooling, but once
 the assembly line is going the units are fairly cheap to make.  
Therefore, the more we make at once, the cheaper the per-unit cost is.</p>
<p>The high costs of starting an assembly line, combined with the 
mandatory up-front FCC and Carrier fees, mean that we need at minimum 
funding level of $220,000 to start this operation.

</p>
<p>
While there are some low-volume production methods that can turn out 
devices in much smaller quantities (such as 3D printing), their per-unit
 cost is so high that they would be completely unaffordable, even by 
comparison to a sport as expensive as skydiving.  (The working
 prototype devices pictured here, and that you may have seen us display 
at Summerfest, cost us over $400/ea just to manufacture!)</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What will the final product cost</h3>
<p>Because the Get It Back is essentially a miniaturized cell phone and communicates via the cellular network, it does require a subscription.  While we are offering very steep discounts to our IndieGoGo backers, and the eventual retail price will be $169 per device, plus a $99/year subscription fee.</p>
<p>Exclusively on IndieGoGo we are offering a Lifetime Subscriptions, which we will NOT be making available after our initial funding campaign.</p>
<h3>Why is there a subscription fee?</h3>Because the combination of GPS and cellular is one of the things that makes the Get it Back so special. It has a cellular transmitter that we have to keep hooked to a provider and pay for every year. It makes it usable almost anywhere in the world that has at least 2G or 3G service. We have agreements with about 130 other countries and there is never a roaming fee. Keep in mind that this considerably cheaper than most GPS trackers on the market now, including the ones for pets, and most of those do not include roaming options. <br/>
<h3>What happens if we don't get funded?</h3>
<div>
<p>I, Taneva Baker, have personally funded all of the R&amp;D myself. I nor the company have any debt whatsoever, so in the unfortunate event that we can get the funds to  go to production, then you will get a full refund through Indiegogo minus %5 for the fees that we loose. You get to keep the awesome swag ;) </p>
<p>Please keep in mind that we are working on some larger contracts, including some military contracts, that won't show up on the Indiegogo page. Just because the Indiegogo page is slow, doesn't mean that we won't get funded. We will keep funders up to date with any exciting news!! </p>
</div>
<h3>What happens if your company closes after we receive our products? Does the Get it Back become obsolete?</h3>
<div>
<p>If we get through manufacturing and get the product out to consumers, it's actually very easy for us to keep the devices connected to the network. So even if we close the doors, as long as you pay the yearly bill we can pay the carriers to keep the device connected from our end. We invested a huge chunk of time and money into a back-end system that would, in the event that we had to stop manufacturing devices, would take care of itself, with minimal input from myself or Brendan. </p>
<p>Yes there is a risk to being an early adapter, but we tried to make it as minimal as possible for the consumers. I feel like it's my personal reputation on the line here with my community and family of skydivers if we let you down. Not just money.</p>
</div>
<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<p>If we can raise more money, we've got some excellent stretch goals that we'd be thrilled to hit:<br/></p>
<h3></h3>
<p><b>$270,000 - Native iOS and Android apps</b></p>
<p>Our current tracking solution utilizes a ""web-app"", a web page that 
acts like an app on your phone.  This is a flexible design, but we'd 
love to raise enough funds for native iOS and Android apps (that would 
be available for free in the iTunes and Google Play stores). 
</p>
<p><b>$1,000,000 - Reduced lifetime subscription costs</b></p>
<b>
</b><p>This would require that we pre-sell almost 5,000<b> </b>Get It Backs, and 
having that many devices to build would give us immense negotiating 
power with our producers for the initial production run to drive costs 
even lower.  We would be able to offer <b>all</b> Indiegogo backers <b>lifetime discounted subscriptions of $69/year</b>.  Please share our campaign with all of your friends (even the wuffos) so we can make this stretch goal a reality!
</p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Development History</h3>
<p>The Get It Back started life the way many hobby electronic projects do; 
with an Arduino and a pile of parts soldered together by hand.  <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<div align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438129040/rrcydyozqfzdlhgsyips.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 339.79px; height: 309px;""/></div>
<p></p>While 
this initial device was far too large to be usable in the skydiving 
world, it was effective in providing a basic test platform to begin 
developing software and testing out ideas.  The lessons learned with 
this initial device were immensely useful and gave us a lot of direction
 when we started down the path of miniaturizing a device ready for 
industrial production.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438129898/v3o0qwgrimvtqpzc6dwc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>While cramming the required electronics into a package small enough to fit on a riser was a complicated enough, the biggest challenge has been in designing an activation method that allows the Get It Back to automatically detect a cutaway with absolutely zero effort required by the user.  We went through dozens of different activation methods before settling on one of the simplest, which makes use of existing skydiving materials and methods.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437980948/pwfaavgnxrdufyotr1d2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>An activation lanyard, made of the exact same cord that your cutaway system uses, is attached to your harness with a traditional C-clip in any location you please, preferably near the base of the 3-ring system.  This lanyard is fed up into a sleeve slid over your front riser that holds the Get It Back device, along with its antenna and battery pack.  <br/></p>
<p>When the cut-away handle is pulled and the three-ring system is released, this lanyard is pulled out of the battery pack, activating the device which begins transmitting it's location long before the canopy has even reached the ground.<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges <br/>
</h3>Our largest risk with this project is that the skydiving market isn't large enough to support the up-front costs of manufacturing a custom-engineered device for an extremely niche application. Help us prove that the skydiving world is big enough, and that everyone is tired enough of losing canopies!<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>How You Can Help</h3>Pre-order a device, and tell your skydiving friends!  Heck, tell your wuffo friends too!  While we've designed this device explicitly for skydivers, we'd love to see what other creative uses people can come up with for such a small, flexible and unique tracking device.<br/>

Yes there is a risk to being an early adapter, but we tried to make it as minimal as possible for the consumers. I feel like it's my personal reputation on the line here with my community and family of skydivers if we let you down. Not just money.

Stretch Goals
If we can raise more money, we've got some excellent stretch goals that we'd be thrilled to hit:

$270,000 - Native iOS and Android apps
Our current tracking solution utilizes a ""web-app"", a web page that 
acts like an app on your phone.  This is a flexible design, but we'd 
love to raise enough funds for native iOS and Android apps (that would 
be available for free in the iTunes and Google Play stores). 

$1,000,000 - Reduced lifetime subscription costs

This would require that we pre-sell almost 5,000 Get It Backs, and 
having that many devices to build would give us immense negotiating 
power with our producers for the initial production run to drive costs 
even lower.  We would be able to offer all Indiegogo backers lifetime discounted subscriptions of $69/year.  Please share our campaign with all of your friends (even the wuffos) so we can make this stretch goal a reality!


Development History
The Get It Back started life the way many hobby electronic projects do; 
with an Arduino and a pile of parts soldered together by hand.  



While 
this initial device was far too large to be usable in the skydiving 
world, it was effective in providing a basic test platform to begin 
developing software and testing out ideas.  The lessons learned with 
this initial device were immensely useful and gave us a lot of direction
 when we started down the path of miniaturizing a device ready for 
industrial production.





While cramming the required electronics into a package small enough to fit on a riser was a complicated enough, the biggest challenge has been in designing an activation method that allows the Get It Back to automatically detect a cutaway with absolutely zero effort required by the user.  We went through dozens of different activation methods before settling on one of the simplest, which makes use of existing skydiving materials and methods.


An activation lanyard, made of the exact same cord that your cutaway system uses, is attached to your harness with a traditional C-clip in any location you please, preferably near the base of the 3-ring system.  This lanyard is fed up into a sleeve slid over your front riser that holds the Get It Back device, along with its antenna and battery pack.  
When the cut-away handle is pulled and the three-ring system is released, this lanyard is pulled out of the battery pack, activating the device which begins transmitting it's location long before the canopy has even reached the ground.

Risks & Challenges 
Our largest risk with this project is that the skydiving market isn't large enough to support the up-front costs of manufacturing a custom-engineered device for an extremely niche application. Help us prove that the skydiving world is big enough, and that everyone is tired enough of losing canopies!
  How You Can HelpPre-order a device, and tell your skydiving friends!  Heck, tell your wuffo friends too!  While we've designed this device explicitly for skydivers, we'd love to see what other creative uses people can come up with for such a small, flexible and unique tracking device.",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2 align=""center""><strong>A shocking Keele University Experiment on Cursing</strong></h2>
<p>To figure out why, psychologists at Britain's Keele University recruited 64 college students and asked them to stick their hands in a bucket of ice water and endure the pain for several minutes.</p>
<p>One group was allowed to repeat a curse word of their choice continuously while their hands were in the water; another group was asked to repeat a non-expletive control word, such as that which might be used to describe a table.</p>
<p>The result was that <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><em>swearing not only allowed students to withstand the discomfort longer, but also reduced their perception of pain intensity</em></span>.</p>
<p><strong>Curse words, the study found, help you cope.</strong></p>
<p>""Swearing increases your pain tolerance,"" says Richard Stephens, a psychologist and lead author of the study, which was published this week in the journal <em>NeuroReport.</em> </p>
<p>Although the experiment's initial hypothesis was inspired by anecdotal evidence from some pain researchers that swearing was actually a maladaptive behavior that served only to make things worse, Stephens' findings showed exactly the opposite.</p>
<h2 align=""center""><strong>Want more proof?</strong></h2>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://72086b8f9325af43e4da-57b9b4b18f06902c4ca8f6f23fa72386.r2.cf1.rackcdn.com/img-oprah-anger.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;""/>""<strong>The No. 1 priority is to make the pain go away. If swearing made the pain worse, that would be illogical</strong>,"" Stephens says, adding that you hardly need a scientific study to bear out the theory.</p>
<p>It was an everyday incident in his backyard that first piqued Stephens' fascination with cursing. While building a shed in his garden, he accidentally hammered his little finger.</p>
<p>""I whacked my hand really, really hard,"" he says, ""and while it was throbbing, I swore a bit."" Being a psychologist, of course that got him thinking, Why did I react in that way?</p>
<p>Later, he witnessed his wife do the same thing while giving birth to their daughter — at moments of intense pain, she would holler expletives. ""She immediately apologized,"" he remembers, ""but the medical staff said, 'Don't apologize! We get this all the time.' ""</p>
<p>That's because humans are <strong>hardwired to swear cathartically</strong>, says <em>Steven Pinker</em>, a <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><em>Harvard psychologist</em></span> and author of <em>The Stuff of Thought</em>, an exploration of the psychology of language.</p>
<p>Pinker distinguishes <strong><em>cathartic cursing</em></strong> from using profanity descriptively, idiomatically, abusively or for emphasis, and points to similar behavior in animals that suggests its evolutionary roots. If you step on a dog or cat's tail, it will let out a sharp yelp of pain, for example.</p>
<p>""Swearing probably comes from a very primitive reflex that evolved in animals,"" Pinker says. ""In humans, our vocal tract has been hijacked by our language skills,"" so instead of barking out a random sound, ""we articulate our yelp with a word colored with emotion.""</p>
<h2 align=""center""><strong>Now you see <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">WHY</span>nothing alleviates pain <br/>more than distilled, multi-faceted “<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Russian Mat</span>” (<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Outperforming Enlgish words 10 to 1)</span>?</strong></h2>
<p>This has to do with phonosemantics, but we won’t bore you to death with this stuff.</p>
<p>As you see, the part of the brain that accounts for the urge to swear — or yelp, in the case of animals — is deep within, suggesting its primitiveness.</p>
<p>Studies of non-human primates show that vocalization is nearly always attributed to subcortical processes in the brain, in those regions that control primal, raw emotions, says <em>Diana Van Lancker Sidtis</em>, a professor of speech language pathology and audiology at <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><em>New York University</em></span>.</p>
<p>In humans too, the urge to swear likely stems from primitive parts, but it is usually overridden by commands from the brain's more complex cortex — the abundant gray matter on which humans rely for language and reason, among other sophisticated abilities.</p>
<p>""We have intact frontal lobes, which inhibit these responses,"" Sidtis explains. But in certain circumstances — either because we don't bother to inhibit them or because the shock of pain or discomfort momentarily surpasses the safeguards — our impulse for obscenity takes over. ""In that way, it's like the dog when you step on his tail,"" Sidtis says.</p>
<h2 align=""center""><strong>A word of caution!</strong></h2>
<p>It may be that swearing serves as an alarm bell, triggering the body's fight-or-flight response, as Stephens postulates in the study.</p>
<p>He and his colleagues found that when study participants used expletives, their heart rates were consistently higher than when they were repeating non-obscene control words — a physiological response that is consistent with fight or flight.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://72086b8f9325af43e4da-57b9b4b18f06902c4ca8f6f23fa72386.r2.cf1.rackcdn.com/img-hammer-swearing.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;""/>But while it is typically fear that triggers the stress response, Stephens suggests the salient emotion in this case is not fear but aggression.</p>
<p>""In swearing, people have an emotional response, and it's the emotional response that actually triggers the reduction of pain,"" says Stephens, whose next step is to research the relationship between induced aggression and reduction of pain.</p>
<p>But before you go yelling “Russian mat” words at every turn, consider this: in Stephens' study, swearing reduced the perception of pain more strongly in women than in men. That may be because in daily life ""men swear more than women,"" says Pinker, which could have the unfortunate side effect of dulling the natural painkiller. ""</p>
<p>“For women I suspect that swearing retains more of an emotional punch because it has not been overused,” he says.</p>
<p>""That's one of the reasons that I think people should not overuse profanity in their speech and writing,"" says Pinker. ""That's not because I'm a prude, but because it blunts swear words of their power when you do need them. You should save them for just the right occasions.""</p>

ISBN-10: 1484121864 
Here’s how YOU can help!
To cover bills for editing, proofreading and translating into English our practical “Russian Mat” guidebook, we need $17,400.
Delivering the book (and accompanying MP3 files) to majority or libraries in the US will take 121,169 * $13.80 = $1,672,132.2
But we have a bit smaller distribution than president Obama’s campaign… and set realistic goal of delivering the book to at least 25% of these libraries, that’s 30,292 of them.
30,292 * $13.80 = $418,030
To start things off,  we’ve lowered the threshold to just 5% of the libraries because I’m certain we’ll have better terms from the publisher once we hit that mark.
5% of the libraries is just 6058, and
6058 * $13.80 = $83,607
$17,400 plus $83,607 gives us $101,007 for making English-speaking world a better place to live for everyone, including YOU.
We won’t stop there and will spread the Russian Mat book to more libraries and to  other countries once we get better terms from the publisher and get media coverage.
With your help, reaching this bold goal will be much more fast…
…and fun for YOU. Here’s how!
This book project will stay in libraries forever.
Your help could put YOUR name in history! So one move towards the big, great, hairy, audacious goal is worth a thousand swear words.
I would appreciate if you help me and the team fund this project.

<h3>The Diaper Drop was born...</h3>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>out of our own family's needs. I grew up  in a home that didn't have a washer or dryer, much food or a father. It was mom and us kids. We struggled just to meet the daily basic needs for our little brothers and sisters. There were 11 siblings plus myself. I know the pain of not having the fundamentals for everyday survival, this wreaks havoc on a family and this was without a <em><strong>hurricane...</strong></em>
</div>
<div><em><strong> </strong></em></div>
<div>We had a ""Love net"" though our church and our neighbors helped us get through tuff times, with donations of food clothing and lots of hugs. I made a promise, when I had the resources I would give back to allieviate some pain of those in need. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>My oldest daughter had her first baby at fifteen and as Hilary Clinton said ""It takes a villiage to raise a child"" 6 more followed fast and furiously. The needs were mostly diapers, obviously. Then I met a man, who created a website (<a href=""http://www.dropopp.com/home/DiaperDrop.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.dropopp.com/home/DiaperDrop.aspx</a>). He had an idea to send my daughter diapers from the site, since we lived out of state. This was easier than sending money and made sure the need was met. It also enabled us to see how the website worked and if others could do the same. History was made and the Diaper Drop was born.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Seeing a greater need, and the devestation that Hurricane Sandy has brought to the East Coast, we bring the Diaper Drop to the people that need a ""Love Net"". Thanks to Indiegogo its easy for everyone to pitch in. One of our basic human needs, is to be a part of something greater than ourselves, and by working together as a community we can create healing and have the collective power to change things.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>How we gonna do this?</strong></div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div>We thought about stuffing a truck with diapers and driving it up to New York from Mississippi, while collecting diapers along the way, but the money and time were big issues. So we decided to use the Indiegogo site as our platfrom. We are asking YOU the community to partner with us by donating the funds. We will purchase the diapers from the closest Walmart's in the heavy struck areas of New York and get them to the families. This will reduce the cost of shipping, moving a truck/gas/food/ lodging and all other expenses, to get more diapers for your buck$$.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>How will your dollars be put to work?</strong></div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div>When we reach our goal, the two of will us fly to New York (on our dime) and rent a truck in the area. Then purchase the diaper and baby needs, fill up the truck and with the help of the local Television &amp; radio news stations get the word out. We will have appointed days, times and locations for distributions so that the people can get to us. If not we will drive to them. ""Come hell or high water we will do this"" </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The whole country is getting involved in helping rebuild the communities that have been devastated by Sandy's fury. It will take a villiage and all of us as neighbors, no matter how many miles apart can help. We start at the bottom (the baby's bottoms) and work our way up!</div>
<h3>You can also help...</h3>
<div>Put together your own campaign and or Diaper Drive. Anyone can do it, it just takes a vison, people who are willing and a need (not lacking here). Also you can Share this campaign on your social networks...Thanks!</div>

You read it right... there are only a few things that are for certain in life... Death, Heaven, Love and TAXES!  We hope to take a small portion of our contributions and use them to subsidize the capital gains tax that we must pay for pre-selling our perks to you!  This may not be the most appealing notion in the world, but we want to be honest about where all of the money is going!

 
Grand Total: $35,000
(NOTE: This total is not reflected in our Indiegogo Campaign Goal.  This is because we wanted to set a more modest goal with the hope and faith that things will go really well!)

<h2><strong>What We Need and What You Get</strong></h2>
</center>
<p>We are raising $10,000 to place our first large order of kik brand soccer balls. The best part is that your not only helping us with our order, but your getting an awesome soccer ball to show off to your friends. You'll also be giving a ball away to a child in need. We at kik soccer call that a win, win, win.</p>
<p>We are offering a full lineup of top quality balls for players on all levels. All of our balls include a full 2 year guarantee. Here's a quick overview of our offering:</p>
<p><strong>Prime Training Ball - Sizes 3, 4, and 5</strong><br/>Prime is a great every day ball for coaches, parents, and players looking for a great training ball for players of all ages.<br/>Hand-Sewn 32 Panel, Leatherite Shine, 4-Layer, Latex Bladder</p>
<p><strong>Strife Match Ball - Size 5</strong><br/>Strife is the ideal match ball. A great ball for players who already know the game and who are looking for a responsive soft-touch ball.<br/>Hand-Sewn 32 Panel, Ducksung PU Leather, 4-Layer, Latex Bladder</p>
<p><strong>Conquer Premier FIFA Ball - Size 5</strong><br/>The Conquer is a professional level ball for play-makers. Only for people who want the best in true-flight and touch. <br/>Hand-Sewn 32 Panel, Cordley, 4-Layer, Latex Bladder, FIFA-Approved Ball</p>
<div> </div>
<div>Because this is our first order, its going to take a little bit to get balls rolling. We have to design the balls, get them manufactured, and finally shipped. From the date of our first order, you should have the ball in hand in 15 weeks. It sounds like a while, but it's only because it's our first order. We'll have stock on hand in the future to fulfill all incoming orders.</div>
<p>In the event we are unable to reach our goal of $10,000, we will only order enough balls for the current demand. For example, say we raise $5,000. We would order all the balls guaranteed with our perks system, including the soccer balls we will give away. We would also still donate money for every ball to the World Food Programme. So it's still a win, win, win for everyone.</p>
<p>If we exceed our goal, we will use the extra money to purchase a larger quantity of soccer balls. This will reduce our cost directly as we get volume discounts. We will also use a portion of any extra money to air frieght our initial order. This will shorten our time to market 4-5 weeks. That's pretty huge.</p>

<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
</center>
<p>By pledging your support and reserving your kik soccer ball today, you are also providing us with balls to give away immediately. This will help us and our partner non-profit organizations, Sport Against Poverty and PeacePassers.Org, be able to start giving balls away immediately to begin making an impact right away.</p>
<p>Soccer is the worlds most popular sport. Millions of children play it everyday, the problem is they play barefoot and with rocks. By giving away soccer balls as a business model, we are giving these kids an opportunity they would not otherwise have. This outreach can be used to encourage team work, confidence, physical condition, and overall well being, with the end result being giving these kids more opportunities on and off the field. </p>
<p>Most of the kids we deal with also have severe poverty issues that do not give them access to the meals they need. By partnering with the World Food Program, we are doing as much as we can to make sure these kids do not go hungry, and can play the game they love for many years to come.</p>

<h3>Please Help Stefphanie Beat Breast Cancer Burden Free!</h3>
On March 12, 2012 Stefphani was diagnosed with Stage 3 Breast Cancer. Only 24 years old and a single mom she endured three months of harsh chemotherapy and since recording this video had both breasts removed. When diagnosed she suddenly had to leave her job to begin 9-10 hour chemo treatments. The loss of income caused an extreme financial burden which resulted in her exhausting all her savings. Our goal is to help relieve her of the financial burden and stress that could hender her healing process and full recovery. </div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Your suport will help cover her basic living expenses over the next six months while she recovers from the bilateral mastectomy, breast reconstruction, and multiple post operative procedures to come (Radiation included). It will be used to pay her rent, utlities, balances on medical bills, and give her the peace of mind of not having to uproot her daughter from their home while she is healing. Overall her modest lifestye only requires funds specifically for the following expenses:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Rent</li>
<li>Utilities</li>
<li>Phone</li>
<li>Dr. Visit &amp; Prescription Co-Pays / Existing Medical Bills </li>
<li>Clothing and School Supplies for her daughter</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>For such a young woman having little to no family financial support Stefphanie has shown tremendous strength and courage throughout her ordeal. She is a true survivor and is looking forward to using her experience to help:    </p>
<ul>
<li>young women with breast cancer understand the challenges they may face strictly because of their age</li>
<li>young mothers identify sources of support they may not realize exist</li>
<li>spanish speaking women navigate through the confusing medical maze </li>
<li>english speaking physicians better relate to spanish speaking patients. </li>
</ul>
<p>We are friends of Stefph's and we appreciate any amount you can give. I am a two time breast cancer survivor myself and have mentored Stefph and many other women through their diagnosis. I know there is life after breast cancer and your help will give Stefph the hand up she needs to get well and live her life to the fullest!</p>

<p><span><strong>Our objective:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>     To create an outdoor space that will function as a nurturing environment for the community. The park will offer various activities for people of every age in a space that is beautiful, accessible and demonstrates that communities, like Newtown, can efficiently and responsibly produce their own resources. Most importantly, the Park will provide a unique and inspiring space for Newtown’s children as they grow older and advance through the school system.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Site-Planning and Process:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>     Newtown’s five public schools are assembled in a rough circle. There are potential sites--which would be accessible to each school--around the middle. We are currently</span><span> waiting for the State , with assistance from Newtown's Land Use Agency, to approve potential agricultural land for this project. Before the tragedy, we had made significant progress on this process, however, it must be understood that at this time, nearly every town department is overwhelmed with other duties. Land Use is one department that is getting back into operation... We have continued to advance by preparing the first version of our landscape plan for the Department of Agriculture. At the time the land is approved, the community will be invited to review our designs and add their own ideas. Specifically, there will be viewings held in the town hall/library, and all students will be sent home a summary of the park, with space to add their sketches and ideas. These sketches will be collected and used to inform the plan. Volunteers will be involved in installation and management following a final design process.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span><strong>What does a Sustainable Community Park look like?</strong></span></p>
<p><span>First, imagine a beautiful outdoor park, then replace the ornamental plants with species that grow delicious fruit throughout the year. Families are welcome to pick-nick, or harvest apples and chestnuts in the fall. Also, because of its proximity to Newtown’s Public schools, it will be a safe place for students to meet and hang out—one that trumps the typical home basement which so often become the predominant hangout-spots for Newtown’s youth. Instead, they may enjoy ripe berries along paths that connect each school, while passing signage, plaques and a map that explains how to identify and incorporate useful plants into daily life. Park users can play together in clearings, on the playground, or they may be quiet with themselves or a friend on a swing, or lounge in the shade on a hot day. The park is a place to gain skills and discover new hobbies; It is a safe community oriented space where the whole family can find something to do while being surrounded by nature.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span><strong>How does this benefit the community?</strong> </span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>The sustainable community park will contain a few dynamic aspects. Most importantly, the park will include an <strong>organically managed vegetable field</strong>. Teachers would be welcome at the park and encouraged to bring their students and show them how the produce is grown. The produce will be given directly back to the community, specifically to the school cafeterias. The provision of local organics in school meals will encourage greater physical health by replacing some parts of currently mundane, low-nutrient ""Chartwells"" meals. The process of planning, growing, and providing this food will make our community mentally healthier—as those who choose to volunteer on the farm develop meaningful relationships with students and professionals within the educational system. </span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>The park will also contain a <strong>Mixed-Organic Orchard</strong> made up of hardy fruit trees that have been specifically selected for Connecticut's climate, and will be managed with cutting-edge, holistic management practices. The motivation behind creating a holistic, ecologically sound system is that we consider sustainable practices to be essential to the long-term future of any young person in our community. Exposure to sound ecological practices which function on a community scale is a crucial and necessary step towards insuring that this future exists. Beyond education and good fruit, the orchard will provide a pleasant walking and lounging space throughout the summer, and it will draw out the community to gather during harvest. Fruit can be picked on the spot; you can imagine kids sitting down in the shade of a persimmon tree to read a book, lounging in the shade with their friends, all while munching on a freshly picked apple.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Around and in between each element will be various <strong>recreation and leisure spaces </strong>which will be connected by walking paths. For example, gazebos will be artistically scattered throughout the park. These will provide all members of the community with quiet places of contemplation and observation, even a possible place to do homework or have a small meeting. For Newtown's youth, it might also provide the well-needed space for a budding romance—something which many of us who have grown up in Newtown, can attest to sorely needing. There will also be a green where children and teenagers alike can play Frisbee, soccer, or whatever strikes their desire at that moment—simply a safe place to play.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>More than just a farm, the park will contain a <strong>playground</strong> and other 'low carbon' ways to have fun. The specifics of the playground--how it looks, its format and layout--will depend on input from the children themselves. Whether there are tunnels, mazes, things to climb, bounce or balance on is up to them. The playground will be tailored to fulfill the dreams of the children in our community, and is only constrained by their imagination and our financial boundaries.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Each part of the park will be <strong>accessible by paths</strong>, which connect to the existing hiking trails in town, and each school. After school, the park will serve as a safe place for <em>the walkers</em>* (see footnote) to meet and enjoy the delicious ripe berries and fragrant plants that line the sides of the trails. Many of these plants will be labeled as part of an effort to educate those who visit the park on how to identify and use various plants in their own lives. </span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Creating a positive, natural environment for Newtown's youth will help the town recover from the horrific tragedy which occurred on December 14, 2012. Creating this sustainable community park will not only symbolically acknowledge this tragedy, it will also help the youth of our community move forward in an nurturing and educational manner while creating new experiences and new memories. </span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span> </span><span><strong>How to Help:</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>1:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The easiest way to help is by donating right on this fund page! </span></p>
<p><span><strong>2:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Whether you represent yourself, a business, or if you are interested in helping but do not have any spare cash, you can still make a donation to this project and deduct this donation as a charitable contribution on your federal taxes—it’s a win-win situation that doesn’t need to dig a hole in your pocket. A majority of your tax money is already used for federal government procurements given to various defense and security contractors, as well as defense-research grants. By making a charitable donation you are essentially taking funds that would have been taxed and used for military purposes and redirecting them to a sustainable development in a community in dire need of healing and purpose. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Tax Deduction:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>A donation to a local government qualifies as an itemized charitable deduction if the donation is made for a charitable purpose. <strong>Send a check for '<em>sustainable community park</em>' to the mailing address below and</strong> <strong>request a receipt to deduct your donation for your federal income tax</strong>. </span></p>

<p><span><strong>Footnote</strong></span></p>
<p><span>* 'The walkers' is an interesting phenomenon in our town, which was one of the original inspirations for a sustainable community park. Every weekday after school, hordes of young kids, grades 7 - 8, cross the streets from the Middle School, toward the center of town. They have come to be known as <em>‘the walkers</em>’. They might get ice cream or a soda, and always mill about with their close friends and crushes. This lasts until they are told to leave. Often times, ‘walkers’ are escorted out of grocery stores when they clammer about without making a purchase. They are tossed back to the parking lot, eventually to confront a police officer who tries to break up the scene.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>‘The walkers’ is certainly a fond memory for a lot of young people, but it is also a source of friction between shop owners, people in cars, parents, and the police who try to keep balance. It is not totally safe either. Secure paths to a growing oasis is a systematic solution to our young walkers.</span></p>

The playground will be tailored to fulfill the dreams of the children in our community, and is only constrained by their imagination and our financial boundaries.
 
Each part of the park will be accessible by paths, which connect to the existing hiking trails in town, and each school. After school, the park will serve as a safe place for the walkers* (see footnote) to meet and enjoy the delicious ripe berries and fragrant plants that line the sides of the trails. Many of these plants will be labeled as part of an effort to educate those who visit the park on how to identify and use various plants in their own lives. 
 
Creating a positive, natural environment for Newtown's youth will help the town recover from the horrific tragedy which occurred on December 14, 2012. Creating this sustainable community park will not only symbolically acknowledge this tragedy, it will also help the youth of our community move forward in an nurturing and educational manner while creating new experiences and new memories. 
 
 How to Help:
1:
The easiest way to help is by donating right on this fund page! 
2:
Whether you represent yourself, a business, or if you are interested in helping but do not have any spare cash, you can still make a donation to this project and deduct this donation as a charitable contribution on your federal taxes—it’s a win-win situation that doesn’t need to dig a hole in your pocket. A majority of your tax money is already used for federal government procurements given to various defense and security contractors, as well as defense-research grants. By making a charitable donation you are essentially taking funds that would have been taxed and used for military purposes and redirecting them to a sustainable development in a community in dire need of healing and purpose. 
Tax Deduction:
A donation to a local government qualifies as an itemized charitable deduction if the donation is made for a charitable purpose. Send a check for 'sustainable community park' to the mailing address below and request a receipt to deduct your donation for your federal income tax.

Footnote
* 'The walkers' is an interesting phenomenon in our town, which was one of the original inspirations for a sustainable community park. Every weekday after school, hordes of young kids, grades 7 - 8, cross the streets from the Middle School, toward the center of town. They have come to be known as ‘the walkers’. They might get ice cream or a soda, and always mill about with their close friends and crushes. This lasts until they are told to leave. Often times, ‘walkers’ are escorted out of grocery stores when they clammer about without making a purchase. They are tossed back to the parking lot, eventually to confront a police officer who tries to break up the scene.
 
‘The walkers’ is certainly a fond memory for a lot of young people, but it is also a source of friction between shop owners, people in cars, parents, and the police who try to keep balance. It is not totally safe either. Secure paths to a growing oasis is a systematic solution to our young walkers.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We first would like to thank our chocoholic dudes and dudettes, corporate clients, and employees for contributing to our success so far.  When we launched this venture three years ago with no investors or creditors, we knew that staying small and efficient would be our best hope for survival.  The approach has served us well so far.  Thanks to those above, we have been able to stay afloat, create over 20 jobs in our community, and win D Magazine's and Dallas Observer's Best Chocolatier in Dallas awards every year since we opened; not bad for 850 square feet of space.</p>
<p>However, the time has come to spread the love and increase our presence accross the metroplex.  We recently opened our new chocolate factory to relieve the building pressures on our small kitchen, and are planning new stores for exploring, sampling, and devouring.  The Catch-22 here is that any cash needed to expand for the holidays won't be here until after the holidays.  Before taking the traditional bank lending approach, we figured we'd offer our fans a chance to help us along, and save some serious money at the same time (money that would be paid as interest on loans in the alternative scenario).</p>
<p>If you haven't tasted or been exposed to our chocolate and friends, we always have lots of samples waiting at our store in the Bishop Arts District in North Oak Cliff - we'd love for you to swing by and taste it all.  Also, below is a little more information about who we are, and what we aim to be.  Many thanks in advance to those who can contribute and help keep hard-earned dollars circulating in our community, and not padding the banks' bottom lines.</p>
<h3><strong>Dude, Sweet Chocolate...</strong></h3>
<p>At Dude, Sweet Chocolate we concoct, manufacture, distribute, and retail dark chocolate inspired creations.  Our product line is very fluid and seasonal, but usually contains fudges, truffles, toffees, nuts, artisan chocolates, and basically anything else our chef decides to improve by introducing it to cacao.</p>
<p>We strive to differentiate ourselves by maintaining intense focus on the quality of the culinary product itself, and not getting lost in the rest of the product design process.  You will not find a single bow, ribbon, or shiny box in our stores.  Kraft paper packaging, brown labeling, and simple, clean design shift attention to the chocolate, which stands on its own.</p>
<p>Another differentiating factor is the spectrum of unique flavor profiles we cover - savory to sweet, and everything in between.  As an example, a couple of our best sellers are our Albatross blue cheese and sea salt fudge, and our Fungus Amongus porcini and pumpkin seed toffee.  These kinds of collaborations, done well, are the products of incredible culinary experience and vision - Katherine somehow makes it look easy.</p>
<h3>The Dudette - Chef Katherine Clapner</h3>
<p>Katherine is the visionary of the entire Dude, Sweet Chocolate concept, as well as co-founder, co-owner, and Chef of the company itself.  Having over twenty years of experience as a pastry chef, Katherine is a force to be reckoned with in the kitchen.  Prior to founding Dude, Sweet, she served for many years as Executive Pastry Chef at Stephan Pyles restaurant, working directly with Chef/Owner Stephan Pyles, a pioneer of New American Cuisine and legendary founding father of Southwestern Cuisine.  The rest of Katherine’s story is no less impressive.</p>
<p>Coming out of the Culinary Institute of America in New York with an associate’s degree in baking and pastry, Katherine headed overseas and got to work.  Her first stop in Europe was the Savoy in London, followed a few years later by Hotel Cipriani in Venice.  Once back stateside, she worked under the instruction of recognized names such as Chef Charlie Trotter and Chef Kevin Graham.  She trained and held Pastry Chef positions at Charlie Trotter's (Chicago), The Windsor Court Hotel (New Orleans), and many other renowned restaurants.</p>
<p>Before and while with Dude, Sweet Chocolate, Katherine has acted as consulting chef for several restaurant and grocery organizations and projects, including Central Market, PF Chang’s, Blue Mesa, Brookshire’s Grocery, and many other local and national chains.</p>
<h3><strong>Dude, Sweet and the Community</strong></h3>
<p>Dude, Sweet Chocolate is part of the community around us in various ways.  One of the most important is our dedication to partnering with local farmers, beekeepers, and other suppliers of everything we need to keep the place rolling (labels, t-shirts, delivery, banking, etc.).  Many seasonal product runs are specifically focused on local produce, and selected based purely on quality, which shifts seasonally and year-to-year.</p>
<p>The success of Dude, Sweet Chocolate to date has enabled us to create over 20 jobs since opening less than three years ago, and we have a strong preference for hiring from the community surrounding the workplace.  Dude, Sweet also regularly participates in local events and campaigns supporting various organizations, including schools, communities, nonprofits, and the like.</p>
<p>A more subtle, but very important impact we have on the community is the product line itself.  The incredibly well-executed combinations, interesting ingredients, and playful nature of our offerings brings something special to the neighborhood, and also expands our customers’ awareness of, and interest in, new and different culinary approaches and ideas.  Our customers seem to agree that we make a difference; editors of the two largest local weekly/monthly publications (Dallas Observer and D Magazine) have named us the Best Chocolatier in Dallas for the last three years, and when the readers voted they agreed.</p>
<h3>Why We Do What We Do</h3>
<p>At Dude, Sweet Chocolate, our goal is not to be a global mass manufacturer of chocolate products, but to introduce new and unique culinary ideas to the world around us.  While we will continue to grow, our artisan roots will always remind us that the focus belongs on the product, as well as our people who make it all possible.  Our founders make it a personal goal to ensure that every member of the team has an opportunity to participate in our continued success.</p></div>","How You Can Help

<p><br/> </p></span></div>","Dear Friends and Family,
On October 18, 2013, I went to the ER with blood in my urine.  The ER visit was followed by blood tests, a CT scan, and an MRI.  I was diagnosed with both prostate cancer and a urinary tract infection (UTI).  I have a chemical imbalance from brain to prostate as well as sharp pains in the head (10 times pain of a migraine). 
This all started in 2003, when I was first diagnosed with diabetes. Since then I lost weight and was borderline diabetic since 2008. In 2009, I had benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and took medications for this. Basically BPH is an enlarged prostate and everything I drank would go through my kidneys and out of my system so rapidly that I was never able to keep the fluids in.  The BPH was curable and after about 18 months it was better. 
In 2012 I was diagnosed with kidney disease and underwent dialysis through my urinary tract. Between medications, dialysis, and roughly 18 months of hell my kidneys came back to life, and a transplant was no longer needed. The tissues healed and recovered, and I was healing quicker than expected. 
But, from everything that I've gone through and maybe injuries sustained overseas while serving with the International Red Cross, I've been diagnosed with having cancer in the prostate.  Fortunately, it's contained and curable which is great news.  From the dialysis and the wastes through the kidneys and urinary tract, I sustained multiple infections hence the UTI.  It's just a long, painful process before everything is said and done.  I will be taking the chemo pill daily, getting injections for the infections and imbalance weekly and biweekly, and taking other medications for the pain. 
Since 1996, I've been an active member with the Red Cross starting with disaster services on a national level supporting our military and also our fellow Americans helping them in crisis situations and helping them get back to a lifestyle within their means.  From 2001 to current, I have been with the International Red Cross division and have traveled all over the world, mainly to war zones, helping those less fortunate and also bringing our military men and women home safely to their families.  I've implemented many programs for under-privileged women and children as well as fundraisers on a global level.  I've helped millions over my tenure in different capacities and continue to serve my country when we are in need.  I belong to other charitable organizations in my area as that is what I love and enjoy doing.  I am a huge believer in the phrase ""what goes around comes around"", not just because of what I'm going through but what I have seen over the past 17 years.  Helping others is a way of life for me, and that makes it even more difficult for me to ask for help now.
As some of you know, I have been a contract recruiter for almost 8 years.  I have decent insurance and pay 50% of everything with $500 deductibles, $20 co-pays at doctor visits, $25 for generic medicines, but for non generic, I pay 3/4 of amount and that is usually $90-120/month. This process I'm undergoing is expected to take up to 2 years between handling the infection to removal of the prostate and recovery.  The treatments will be expensive over an extended period of time.  This has already started to have a serious impact on me physically, mentally, and financially. 
This indiegogo website has been created to help me get on my feet and hopefully not have to worry about paying the bills to live and survive and be the guy/friend/family member you know.  
All donations are appreciated.  I seriously hope you will consider even a small donation and forward this on to friends and family members who may be able to help.  We are working on a bowling fundraiser and other ways to raise not just funds but awareness as well.  Please reach out to me if you are able to help with fundraising and awareness.
In advance, I just wanted to say thank you for your love, friendship, and support.

<div>In 2010, Karl was diagnosed with a rare form of testicular cancer.  Since then, he has endured two rounds of chemotherapy, bone marrow transplants, and blood transfusions.  This included very expensive treatments in Indiana in 2011.  After many months of recovery, we were happy to see him back in San Francisco teaching again. Then the cancer came back.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>On July 9th of this year, Karl had deep abdominal surgery to slow the spread of the cancer.  It will be followed by another round of chemo and uncertain timeframe for recovery, it depends on whether it works or not, during which he cannot work.  While Karl does have insurance, and family is helping, the load for deductible, out of pocket and not covered medical expenses, as well as living expenses is not totally covered. Current sources and what income he does have will not pay his bills by far.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We need all the help we can get to raise funds.  His family has been wonderful, dedicating much time and care-taking.  And even with the tremendous fatigue that comes with cancer treatment, Karl has done his best to continue working to pay his bills.</div>

<p>For some of you who may not know us, my name is Thanh and my wife’s name is Jennifer. We’ve been happily married for over 9 years and we would like to ask for your help. 3 years ago Jennifer developed an illness called IgA nephropathy <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001500/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001500/</a>. This illness attacked Jennifer’s kidneys and now she needs a kidney transplant. While waiting for over 2 years for a kidney, Jennifer has had over 20 surgeries ranging from minor procedures putting in a dialysis catheter to heart surgery to remove a tumor. I do hemo-dialysis (filtering blood) for Jennifer 6 days a week for the last 2 years. Jennifer was a hygienist but due to her illness her work place released her last year before Christmas. So she has been unemployed for a year now. Because of this I work somewhere between 10-12 hours a day to pay the bills and sometimes this isn’t enough.</p>
<p>On New Years day of this year, Jennifer and I got a phone call from KU Medical Center and our prayers were answered when they told us there was a kidney for her. UNFORTUNATELY, the day before, Jennifer had a fever of 101.7 degrees. Because of this, they gave the kidney to someone else who was not sick. Due to her immune system being weakened from medicines related to the surgery, she could die if she proceeded with the transplant while being ill. Currently Jennifer is taking medicines to get better so when they call us again, we’ll be ready to go to Kansas City, MO. Jennifer could get a kidney this weekend coming up or next month; it’s hard to tell. When she does get a kidney though, our journey will have just began. We will have to take a 3 hour drive to Kansas City, MO where Jennifer will be in the hospital for 7 days for pre and post surgery. Then we are required to live in Kansas City (be close to KU Medical Center) for another 7 days just in case there is any rejection of the new kidney. After the 14 days, we will need to come back to Kansas City once every week for one month, and then every 6 months for the next couple of years.</p>
<p>Jennifer and I need your help. I will need to take off of work for a significant time, the cost of the previous trips to KU (for testing), the cost of this trip, future trip for her new kidney, and the initial cost of immune-suppressant drugs and I don’t think we will be able to make ends meet. Even though I have a good job, that pays better than average, good insurance, and we have been saving a little bit of money but we’re still going to come up short.</p>
<p>Overall, we need over $4,000 but Indego charges 9% if you don’t meet your goal so we’re hoping to ask for $4,000. Just so you guys have an idea of what your contribution will be helping us with here is a list of SOME of the cost we’ll need to pay for.</p>
<p>Money needed to pay for bills for the month due to me not working. $2,300.00<br/> 7 days in a motel/hotel near the Hospital. $600.00<br/> Transportation cost for all the trips to Kansas City, 6 trips. $475.00 <br/> Meals while in Kansas City for 14 days. $500.00<br/> Initial Immuno-suppressant drugs. $250.00</p>
<p>When Jennifer gets a kidney it would mean so much to us if you could help us out, we understand that money is tight for everyone but even if you could give $5 it can go along way with as many friends that we have. If you can also please get our story out there and help us as much as you can. We love you all and thank you so much for helping us.  </p>

<div>Rayn Josephine Marie Nigro was born on October 1, 1994.  She has lived in Johnsonville NY for her entire life.  She has attended Hoosic Valley schooling, where she has participated in many clubs and activities.  She partakes in Foreign Language club, SADD, and she is part of the Yearbook staff.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Where Rayn's time was mostly spent, however, was being part of a sports team.  Regardless of the season Rayn participated in a sport.  During the fall it was Volleyball, where she would frequently be high scorer, and had the most kills.  During the winter Rayn was part of the basketball team.  During her junior year, her team worked hard and became the New York State Champions.  Her free time during the Spring was occupied by the Hoosic Valley track and field team and field team.  She was Wasaren League Champion for High Jump, but she also did Long Jump, Pole Vault, and Triple Jump.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This is Rayn's senior year of high school and the time to make decisions as to which school she will attend next fall was swiftly approaching.  Upon the end of the Volleyball season, where Rayn's team lost in the semi-finals of the Sectional games, she was offered an athletic scholarship to SUNY Canton. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Rayn was unfamiliar with this college so she and her friend Tiffany scheduled a tour of the college.  They skipped school and left for the college visit on November 28th planning to return on the next day, November 29th. During the visit she attended several Criminal Justice classes, got the tour of the campus, and played with the Girls Volley ball team. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>When she awoke in the morning she and Tiffany packed up and got on the road to make it home in time for basketball practice that afternoon. On the way back Rayn got tired and allowed Tiffany to drive.  She proceeded to nap while Tiffany continued to drive them home.  When Rayn woke up she told Tiffany that she was alright to drive again, so she told Tiffany to get off at the next exit.  As they were pulling off the exit ramp, they lost control of the vehicle and the car rolled onto its side, the car hit a guardrail and proceeded to roll down a hill, completing 8 rotations of the vehicle.  A car driving the other direction saw the car rolling down the hill and immediately called the police while pulling a U-turn.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The first sheriff on the scene instantly knew that Rayn would need helicopter assistance to Albany Medical Center.  She was rushed into the ER for an emergency CT Scan.  It showed the Doctors that she had small amounts of bleeding on the brain.  This is what made Rayn remain unconscious.  She also had a break in the Right Clavicle, and a small fracture on the tip of her tail bone.  Rayn spent the first night in the Neurological Observation unit.  The next afternoon she was transported to the Trauma unit. After one or two good days the hospital wanted to release Rayn home.  Several people, including Nurses (who will remain Nameless), did not think that Rayn was ready to be Discharged.  Her brother Gage called the Brain Injury Association Of New York and hassled the people there to get Rayn into a Rehabilitation Center.  That is where Rayn is now, at the SunnyView Rehabilitation Center.</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
Seeing as the driver of the vehicle was Unlicensed and not covered by Rayn's insurance, the car insurance company is only willing to pay for up to $100,000. The break down that our family received of the pricing is as follows:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Helicopter Ride: $150,000</li>
<li>One night in the Neurological Obsevation Unit: $50,000</li>
<li>Six days in Trauma @ $30,000 a day: $180,000</li>
<li>Six shots of Morphine @$2,500 per shot: $15,000</li>
</ul>
<p>This brings the total to $395,000, subtract the $100,000 from the insurance company and that $295,000.  This doesn't include the transportation to the Rehab Center, the multiple X-rays and MRI's she received, the medications for nausea and pain on top of morphine, the rehabilitation center costs, or the months of therapy in the near future.</p>
<p>So as you can see this is a huge financial burden our family has taken on, and we are asking for help from friends, family, community members, anyone really.  We are setting our goal to $50,000 for now, this is to avoid the fee's from this site, but in all reality we need much much more.  Anything you or your families can do will help our family and it will be greatly appreciated.  Please share this link to all social media sites and anywhere else you can think to post it.  Our family appreciates anything you can do.  Thanks</p>

<b>WE HAVE HOPE FOR TAVISH'S FUTURE BUT WE NEED YOUR HELP! </b><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Tavish Kliewer is an amazing 12 year old boy who is severely affected by autism. Right now, Tav is going through one of the hardest times of his life and needs help.</span></p>
<p>Over the past few months, there has been a significant increase in self-injurious and aggressive behaviours that are getting dangerous; both to himself and to those around him. As a result, Tav's Mom and Dad have sought out help in the form of intensive behavioural therapy designed to address these types of issues.<br/><br/>The problem is that intensive, targeted, proven ABA based interventions are very, very expensive and funding is almost impossible to access. So, that's where you come in! This page will serve to help facilitate the process of raising the funds required to give this incredible little boy a chance at a better quality of life. <br/><br/>How the money will be used:<br/><br/>Two qualified and experienced therapists (experts in the field) have been retained to deliver the therapy. Their services will be paid with funds raised.<br/><br/>Tav's parents and therapy team will need to purchase equipment and supplies to use in the course of treatment. These will be paid for with funds raised. <br/><br/>Tav will need follow-up sessions and his school and centre staff will have to be trained to maintain his gains and ensure that he continues to be successful. This will be paid for with funds raised. <br/><br/>And finally, as Tavish is non-verbal, learning a new and comprehensive communication system will be of utmost importance to ensure success. He will need access to augmentative communication software, potentially new hardware and people trained around him to continue to help him learn to better communicate. This will be paid for with funds raised. <br/><br/>Our eventual goal is to raise $20,000 to offset the costs. However, we are starting smaller so that we can get started as soon as possible. And rest assured that every cent raised will be spent on Tavish's treatment and accounted for, should you be interested in seeing a break down. <br/><br/>Please help us achieve this goal.

<h3>The idea and how it began</h3>
<p>I, a 20 years old Software Engineering student from Germany, am sports and social media interested for quite a few years.</p>
<p>At one day (end of 2012) the idea to build a new platform to combine these interests came up in my head (must have been in the shower or other places where you get great ideas). I liked it and started to plan this project on my own first. </p>
<p>But I didn't just like it because it combines my interests! It was more the feeling of creating something that could help many ambitious, dedicated and focussed athletes all over the world.
Do you remember the time where you just started lifting weights, eating healthy and working your ass of to reach your dream body?</p>

<p></p>
<p>If you do so, think of the load of different information you got from the internet, books, friends, ominous trainers and other people. That was not always right, was it?

While planning ShapeLoggers I always thought about making things easier. I took the main components of successful fitness and bodybuilding (training, nutrition and recovery) and designed tools to track, log, plan and document them. So you always see where you are for example at your training at the moment, how much calories you eat and how your body reacts on what you are doing!</p>
<p>It took a while to do a bit of research, plan and implement the planned functions. I worked whole nights (yeah... sleeping is important for fitness), before university, during university, after university, on holiday and finally on 19th July 2013 the first stable BETA of ShapeLoggers was released under a ""de""-domain.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>From then I worked on spreading ShapeLoggers to the German athletes and implementing new features and functions daily. But the big problem that I had to face, and always do, is that I am alone, have no money for advertising and spreading ShapeLoggers and do not even earn something from it (quite the opposite).</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>The turning point</h3>
<p>I want to change that now with this Crowdfunding project and I need YOUR help to go on with ShapeLoggers. I don't want it to be just another unimportant portal on the web because I designed it to help people and combine every possible tool for fitness, bodybuilding and other sports where you lift weights.</p>
<p>This thinking leads me to the following points which are not doable if there is no money for them, and for which I need your support:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Offering more than one language (which is currently only German) (350€ for new law-required texts per language)</li>
<li>Buying more domains (70 €/year)</li>
<li>Hire more webspace, bigger databases and stronger server in general (150 €/year)</li>
<li>Advertising on the Internet and, if possible, in huge gym-companies (2000€ once)</li>
<li>A lawyer to advocate me in legal aspects (one time: 349€ + 480€/year)</li>
<li>External &amp; feed-required programming libraries and programms for some new functions (about 80-120€ once) </li>
<li>For new functions in general</li>
<li>ShapeLoggers' internal awards where you can compete with other athletes and win prices (120€/year for prices)</li>
<li>One very big thing: an Android and iOS-App (Apple Dev-License: 80€/year)</li>
<li>Launch a shop with merchandise (1500€ seed capital)</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, the main point is ""getting bigger"" to reach more people, not only in Germany like it's the case now, but in THE WHOLE WORLD.</p>
<p>4100€ fixed costs and 900€ per year, so this can survive about 4 years until the shop will hopefully cover all yearly costs. </p>

This campaign has been created to help raise funds his family so desperately needs in order to make their home handicap accessible. There are two immediate needs: </p><p>-A remodel of the front doorway</p><p>- A remodel of the bathroom in order to fit a handicap accessible shower</p><p>This disorder typically causes servere weakness requiring the use of a wheelchair. As much as Garrett has fought using a wheelchair full-time, he does have to use it for mobility at school and most daily activities. He now needs upgrades to his home to improve his quality of life.</p><p>Garrett is a great kid with such a huge heart and his extended family is trying to raise some money to help off-set the costs of the immediate need to upgrade his home for a little sense of ease in his day to day life. The current bathroom is too dangerous and he risks falling and seriously injuring himself and his parents have a difficult time lifting him in and out of the tub.  Also, Garrett cannot enter his house with his wheelchair, so the front of his house needs to be remodeled with a wheelchair ramp.</p><p>Despite this debilitating disease, through extreme strength and determination, Garrett has managed to start high school even though he was told early on that he would likely be wheelchair bound by eight years old - but school is very tough for him because of his disability. He was often bullied and still cannot participate in many activities his classmates may take for granted. The staff of Cartersville School System has stepped up at any time the family has voiced concerns in order to make his school experience more positive. In particular, Stephanie Ericks, Nick Bridges and Jessica Bunce (his teachers) have been very helpful.</p><p>The emotional pain is hard, but Garrett has never known a day in his life without excruciating physical pain.  His doctors report that his pain level has always been off the charts. His family is asking the community to band together so they can do whatever they can to make his life more comfortable. </p><p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p><p>We need to raise $20,000 to renovate the front of Garrett's home to make it wheelchair accessible as well as building a shower that can accommodate his wheelchair. These changes will offer Garrett the freedom and independence any teenage boy deserves. However, we are setting the goal at $10,000 to ensure we meet it and can get at least one project completed.</p><p>We have lots of great perks to donating such as jewelry, Braves tickets, a signed football from Mark Richt and much more. So please take a look and give what you can!</p><p></p><h3>National Muscular Dystrophy Awareness Month</h3><p>Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy prevents the production of dystrophin which is the normal protein in muscle and typically appears between the age of two and six affecting 1 out of 3500 boys.  Because of this, muscle weakness can begin as early as age three, first affecting the muscles of the hips, pelvic area, thighs and shoulders, and later the skeletal (voluntary) muscles in the arms, legs and trunk. The weakness typically causes clumsiness, frequent falling, an unusual gait and general weakness. Most patients with Duchennes require a wheelchair.</p><p>By the early teens, the heart and respiratory muscles also are affected. Sadly most do not make it past their early 20s because the muscles in the heart and lungs are no longer capable of functioning to support life.</p><p>There is currently no cure for DMD.  It is a terminal condition. </p><p>With this month being Muscular Dystrophy awareness month, in addition to fundraising, Garrett's family hopes to raise awareness and understanding about this disease. </p><p>""My son and our family hopes that if more people are aware of this diagnosis, these kids will be treated kinder or more normal,"" Garrett's mom explains. ""Go up and speak with children in wheelchairs.  Most kids just love some kind of positive contact.  It may be a little different in some instances due to some children just do not get the socialization they need.  So please take time to share a few minutes with special needs children.  It will make a huge difference in their lives.""</p><p></p><h3>More About Garrett</h3><p>Garrett loves hunting and fishing which is typical for kids in Cartersville and North Georgia. His family is comprised of fisherman and hunters, so he has been surrounded by this his whole life. He loves Country Music and enjoys video games.  He doesn't have a lot of strength in his hands, so video games can be a bit tricky. </p><p>As he has recently turned fifteen, seeing his classmates and cousins all learning to drive and getting their permits, he would like to be able to drive as well.  Even if he could get a learner's license, his family - even if they all pooled our money together - could not afford a vehicle outfitted for his disabilities.  </p><p>A friend of the family, Russell, realized how much Garrett enjoyed the outdoors and driving.  Russell located a second hand golf cart which the owner donated. Garrett really enjoys driving it around.  It allows him freedom around the yard, coming and going to his grandparents next door and most of all to and from the lake to fish.  The camouflage golf cart helps him get around without feeling disabled.</p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>If you can not contribute financially, please share Garrett's story! Please help get the word out and allow others the opportunity to band together as a community to help this family in need. Most importantly, please remember Garrett and his family in your prayers. Thank you for any consideration you may offer to this very worthy cause.</p><p></p></div>","Short SummaryGarrett Andrews is a 15 year-old living in Cartersville, GA who was born with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.

She founded the Cancer Schmancer Movement so that what happened to her won't happen to other people. That's why she's sounding the alarm about carcinogens in our food, cosmetics, and home cleaning products.</p>
<p>Perhaps if Fran had known what she'd been exposing herself to when she was a teenager, she wouldn't have had the cancer and the radical hysterectomy that saved her life. At the time, she was in love with a man and planning on having children with him. But you don't get to choose the cards life deals you. You only get to choose how to play them. Fran decided to turn her pain into purpose. She may not have been able to have children with the man she loved, but she can help you protect <b>your</b> kids. That's why this program means so much to her.</p>
<p>So much so that Fran is putting her money where her famous voice is. She'll match donations up to $25,000. Donate $1, and she'll make it $2. She's doing half the lifting.

<p>Before we go to the entire country, we need to develop the pilot program. The $10,000 we're raising will go toward the pilot launch on Earth Day 2015 at two schools  in the Los Angeles area. Following the in-school presentation, students are encouraged to learn more on their own with takeaway projects that they can do both at school and at home with their parents.</p><p>We will then make revisions based on the pilot schools' feedback before we expand the program to other schools across the United States. The program may be led by any adult or group of adults -- school administrator, teacher or parent. We will also make the curriculum available to parents who home school.  <br/></p>
<p>Funds that exceed our goal will be used for this expansion and go toward developing our online community and a mobile app that children can use when out shopping or at a restaurant to identify toxins in food and products they're considering purchasing.</p>

<h3>Thank You So Much! xo-F</h3></div>","UPDATE: Thank you for helping us reach our initial goal. We can now move onto raising money to develop our online community.
Childhood illness and obesity has more than tripled over the past few decades. Our children are exposed to more and more chemicals. Many of them toxic, the large majority of them untested. While we don't know all of the long-term effects, we do know that it's making them sick and cutting their life expectancy.Cancer Schmancer's Detox Your Home in-school program hopes to reverse that trend. The steps a child takes to reduce cancer risk are the same as those to reduce a host of childhood illnesses like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. And here's a shocking fact. Only 10% of cancers are caused by genetics. You have 90% control over whether you get sick or not. We plan on bringing this message to every school in the nation, teaching kids how to avoid harmful toxins IN their food, what they put ON their skin, and AROUND their homes. We will also teach strategies for healthy eating, exercise, and stress-reduction. The habits we develop when we're young last a lifetime. Kids who follow Cancer Schmancer's guidelines will be less likely to develop cancer and other chronic disease. We want to give children longer lives of higher quality.Healthy kids grow into healthy parents who raise even healthier kids and so on. Imagine the impact. Our hope is to wipe out cancer in the next generation. It may sound like an impossible dream, but who got anywhere dreaming small?Our Leader: Fran Drescher
You may know Fran Drescher as the star of The Nanny, but you may not know that she is a uterine cancer survivor. She founded the Cancer Schmancer Movement so that what happened to her won't happen to other people. That's why she's sounding the alarm about carcinogens in our food, cosmetics, and home cleaning products.
Perhaps if Fran had known what she'd been exposing herself to when she was a teenager, she wouldn't have had the cancer and the radical hysterectomy that saved her life. At the time, she was in love with a man and planning on having children with him. But you don't get to choose the cards life deals you. You only get to choose how to play them. Fran decided to turn her pain into purpose. She may not have been able to have children with the man she loved, but she can help you protect your kids. That's why this program means so much to her.
So much so that Fran is putting her money where her famous voice is. She'll match donations up to $25,000. Donate $1, and she'll make it $2. She's doing half the lifting. Will you lift the other half? 
What We Need & Why
Before we go to the entire country, we need to develop the pilot program. The $10,000 we're raising will go toward the pilot launch on Earth Day 2015 at two schools  in the Los Angeles area. Following the in-school presentation, students are encouraged to learn more on their own with takeaway projects that they can do both at school and at home with their parents.We will then make revisions based on the pilot schools' feedback before we expand the program to other schools across the United States. The program may be led by any adult or group of adults -- school administrator, teacher or parent. We will also make the curriculum available to parents who home school.  
Funds that exceed our goal will be used for this expansion and go toward developing our online community and a mobile app that children can use when out shopping or at a restaurant to identify toxins in food and products they're considering purchasing.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>After many decades and life-times of struggle in exile, I have found a place to call home in the beautiful landscapes of South West Bohemia. Here, nested among nature and trees, on a hill of solid rock, I bought an old small farmhouse with a deep well built like a temple of large granite blocks.</p>
<p>It is a place for me to reclaim roots and spread my wings. A place for rest and remembering.</p>
<p>With my background in healing and soul work, I would like to open this home to like-minded community, to whom is in need of a retreat within and open-hearted mutual support, play, and healing.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477840132/vhqdbubidjmdecrfspq4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order for the property to serve as a sanctuary not just for me, but also for the wider community there are two rooms that need to be reconstructed before I can host guests. The wall between those particular rooms has been affected by damp and requires professional treatment which is beyond my means.</p>
<p>In addition, I plan to turn the barn which has beautiful granite walling into a workshop space perfect to hold <a href=""http://www.goddessinanna.com/sacred-soulbody-transmission/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sacred Soul*Body Transmissions.</a></p>
<p>If the goal isn't reached I will continue working towards this vision with whatever means will be available to me.</p>
<p>It feels most natural to me to work from home, to share my home for healing and nourishment. I feel that this option is central to what I am able to offer to the world, and I have a lot to offer...</p>
<p>Here's what you will help to make possible. These are two core offerings that I consider to be the crux of my life's work. There are the <a href=""http://www.goddessinanna.com/personalized-retreats/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Personalized Retreats for Individuals</a> and <a href=""http://www.goddessinanna.com/sacred-soulbody-transmission/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sacred Soul*Body Transmissions</a> which will be held in small groups but can be also incorporated into an Individual Retreat. Please check these out and see if it resonates. These are highly unique offerings essential for human kind's evolution.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p>This project is valuable to the world because you won't find any other place to offer exactly this. The deeper message is crucial to a new way of being we are all learning as we enter a whole different age. It's intended to heal the wounds inflicted in the thousands of years of our past of non-respecting what's natural and restore what's true and authentic. The scale of this project isn't important, the strength is in the ripples...</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Challenges, challenges... I've overcome so many challenges to get to this point that I could write a novel, and in fact, I am writing one. The way I see it is that this is important for my evolution. It's important to pioneer this way of being for mankind's evolution. If there will be challenges, we'll deal with them, and we'll know how to deal with them when they come.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand that sometimes we simply aren't in any position to help financially, god knows I've been there often enough, so if you resonate with my mission, it would mean the world to me if you could share it with your circle and with whom ever you think this might be a match for. And if you say a little bit about me or this project in your own words, it would have an even bigger impact. You can use the sharing buttons on this page or just copy and paste the URL.

<p><br/>And now I've come to a place where I'm just very very tired... I've been lifetimes on the run, persecuted from all sides, yet taking no side myself. Now I just want to rest, to lie down in bed, cuddle with my animal companions, care for my life gently, do a little bit of what I love.<br/><br/>All I want is to take care of my home and watch animals, to have friends around who understand me. To dig in and inhale nature. To always have moss under my feet and pine scent in the air surrounding me. To touch soft grass and brass tree bark, to smell burning wood from life preserving fire. To drink clean water, and eat healthy food... To enjoy a bit of art's &amp; crafts. To place my healing hands on those seeking touch. To share my experience with those who don't know where they are. To land home, a home which becomes a light within me.<br/>With everything so soft and nurturing, where there is no need to be anyone or to defend anything.<br/>A place from which there is nowhere else to go, where one can plant roots and spread wings. A grounded space, a supported space, a form that supports no form. A place where I can fall in love with life again. Where I no longer be a hermit but where I'll return to the place of belonging and say: Welcome, wanderer. Come in, rest. You will be fed. You have found your home here.<br/><br/>Healing is simple in nature's embrace where we remember how to embrace ourselves.<br/><br/>Modern world and modern spirituality would have you chase success, chase healing, chase happiness... but all of that leads in the wrong direction – away from yourself, getting further and further lost, deeper and deeper disconnected...<br/>Here you will only rest. And in that simplicity, you will wait in a space to meet yourself.</p>

<p><i>Fascinating</i><i> woman that one.</i></p>
<p><i>She was born 'Zahradka',</i></p>
<p><i>married 'Zahradka',</i></p>
<p><i>and lived in a place called 'Zahradka',</i></p>
<p><i>all total coincidence of course.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>That I almost bought the house</i></p>
<p><i>she was born in,</i></p>
<p><i>before I bought the one,</i></p>
<p><i>where she died,</i></p>
<p><i>also a total coincidence,</i></p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Respectfully</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>I didn't choose this place.</i></p>
<p><i>This place has chosen me,</i></p>
<p><i>and one by one it's uncovering</i></p>

<p> </p>
<p><i>The Beauty that lives here</i></p>

<p><i>Somehow, I look prettier,</i></p>

<p>I have created such beautiful healing space for myself that, paradoxically, I'm more aware of how ill the world outside of it is.</p>
<p>So besides bringing the healing space with me wherever I go, which is part of my own ongoing journey, I'd like to open its doors, the doors to a place where I found my home, to the world.</p>
<p>This place is mine, to create my own rules in, but I don't own it. It's a partner to me, and I belong to it just as it belongs to me, and it wants to be filled with my healing work just as it heals me, and open this healing to flow out into the world.</p>
<p>The water, the trees, the bees, the clouds and the wind, everything here is attuned to a very specific vibration – a tad witchy and shamanic – it invites to a feminine flowering, to an opening to the brilliance of the light that is found in the dark within. The darkness which everything springs from is almost palpable here. You can touch upon the pulse of divine creation and blessing. You will identify this pulse as your own. The dark womb of your Soul calls through the beauty of the world to return to your source.</p>
<p>It calls you to rest and unravel. To remember innocence. To trade the falsities of the busy world for a true belonging. It calls to a journey within, where the greatest treasures are excavated to be brought into the world without.</p>

Short Summary
After many decades and life-times of struggle in exile, I have found a place to call home in the beautiful landscapes of South West Bohemia. Here, nested among nature and trees, on a hill of solid rock, I bought an old small farmhouse with a deep well built like a temple of large granite blocks.
It is a place for me to reclaim roots and spread my wings. A place for rest and remembering.
With my background in healing and soul work, I would like to open this home to like-minded community, to whom is in need of a retreat within and open-hearted mutual support, play, and healing.


What We Need & What You Get
In order for the property to serve as a sanctuary not just for me, but also for the wider community there are two rooms that need to be reconstructed before I can host guests. The wall between those particular rooms has been affected by damp and requires professional treatment which is beyond my means.
In addition, I plan to turn the barn which has beautiful granite walling into a workshop space perfect to hold Sacred Soul*Body Transmissions.
If the goal isn't reached I will continue working towards this vision with whatever means will be available to me.
It feels most natural to me to work from home, to share my home for healing and nourishment. I feel that this option is central to what I am able to offer to the world, and I have a lot to offer...
Here's what you will help to make possible. These are two core offerings that I consider to be the crux of my life's work. There are the Personalized Retreats for Individuals and Sacred Soul*Body Transmissions which will be held in small groups but can be also incorporated into an Individual Retreat. Please check these out and see if it resonates. These are highly unique offerings essential for human kind's evolution.
AND NOW FOR YOUR REWARDS!
My first new book – *Soulspeak*, focused entirely on pointing you back to who you are.  Learn more about it here.
1-0-1 Soulcraft Mentoring with me – more here.
A Quickie Session – Mini Guidance Session
Both can be held via Skype or Google Hangout. 
Oracular Transmission – details here
The PDF rewards will be delivered as soon as possible. The sessions will be scheduled for whenever suits us both. If there is anything that's urgent, let me know and I'll see what can be done.
Or you would be very welcome to stay with me in The Zahra Centre. Learn more about it here. This can be scheduled between May and September of 2017 and beyond.
If you have any questions related to these rewards please contact me.

The Impact

This project is valuable to the world because you won't find any other place to offer exactly this. The deeper message is crucial to a new way of being we are all learning as we enter a whole different age. It's intended to heal the wounds inflicted in the thousands of years of our past of non-respecting what's natural and restore what's true and authentic. The scale of this project isn't important, the strength is in the ripples...


Risks & Challenges
Challenges, challenges... I've overcome so many challenges to get to this point that I could write a novel, and in fact, I am writing one. The way I see it is that this is important for my evolution. It's important to pioneer this way of being for mankind's evolution. If there will be challenges, we'll deal with them, and we'll know how to deal with them when they come.


Other Ways You Can Help
I understand that sometimes we simply aren't in any position to help financially, god knows I've been there often enough, so if you resonate with my mission, it would mean the world to me if you could share it with your circle and with whom ever you think this might be a match for. And if you say a little bit about me or this project in your own words, it would have an even bigger impact. You can use the sharing buttons on this page or just copy and paste the URL. Thank you!
 
HEALING IS WHERE HOME IS

And now I've come to a place where I'm just very very tired... I've been lifetimes on the run, persecuted from all sides, yet taking no side myself. Now I just want to rest, to lie down in bed, cuddle with my animal companions, care for my life gently, do a little bit of what I love.All I want is to take care of my home and watch animals, to have friends around who understand me. To dig in and inhale nature. To always have moss under my feet and pine scent in the air surrounding me. To touch soft grass and brass tree bark, to smell burning wood from life preserving fire. To drink clean water, and eat healthy food... To enjoy a bit of art's & crafts. To place my healing hands on those seeking touch. To share my experience with those who don't know where they are. To land home, a home which becomes a light within me.With everything so soft and nurturing, where there is no need to be anyone or to defend anything.A place from which there is nowhere else to go, where one can plant roots and spread wings. A grounded space, a supported space, a form that supports no form. A place where I can fall in love with life again. Where I no longer be a hermit but where I'll return to the place of belonging and say: Welcome, wanderer. Come in, rest. You will be fed. You have found your home here.Healing is simple in nature's embrace where we remember how to embrace ourselves.Modern world and modern spirituality would have you chase success, chase healing, chase happiness... but all of that leads in the wrong direction – away from yourself, getting further and further lost, deeper and deeper disconnected...Here you will only rest. And in that simplicity, you will wait in a space to meet yourself.

 
 
I don't know where life is taking me,
and haven't yet decided
whether it feels scary
or free.
 
Perhaps I should be scared,
since I am yet to meet a person
who wouldn't ask
'Aren't you afraid?'
 
And I'm thinking,
the previous inhabitant
of this house
has lived here by herself since 1968,
till she was 96.
 
Fascinating woman that one.
She was born 'Zahradka',
married 'Zahradka',
and lived in a place called 'Zahradka',
all total coincidence of course.
 
That I almost bought the house
she was born in,
before I bought the one,
where she died,
also a total coincidence,
of course.
 
 
Respectfully
 
 
I didn't choose this place.
This place has chosen me,
and one by one it's uncovering
its ancient mysteries
 
The Beauty that lives here
is seeping into me.
Somehow, I look prettier,
when I'm here
 
I dropped right in
into its bio-system
Tuned in into the hum
of insects and birds
 
The elementals
of water, plants, and wind
are no longer
outside of me
 
I let it guide me
in what my hands shall build,
and it guides my Soul
how to grow roots
and butterfly wings
 
The beauty and overwhelm
that makes me drop my chin,
makes my heart quietly sing –
this place,
this here,
just this place,
this time,
right
now,
right
here...

I have created such beautiful healing space for myself that, paradoxically, I'm more aware of how ill the world outside of it is.
So besides bringing the healing space with me wherever I go, which is part of my own ongoing journey, I'd like to open its doors, the doors to a place where I found my home, to the world.
This place is mine, to create my own rules in, but I don't own it. It's a partner to me, and I belong to it just as it belongs to me, and it wants to be filled with my healing work just as it heals me, and open this healing to flow out into the world.
The water, the trees, the bees, the clouds and the wind, everything here is attuned to a very specific vibration – a tad witchy and shamanic – it invites to a feminine flowering, to an opening to the brilliance of the light that is found in the dark within. The darkness which everything springs from is almost palpable here. You can touch upon the pulse of divine creation and blessing. You will identify this pulse as your own. The dark womb of your Soul calls through the beauty of the world to return to your source.
It calls you to rest and unravel. To remember innocence. To trade the falsities of the busy world for a true belonging. It calls to a journey within, where the greatest treasures are excavated to be brought into the world without.

 
 
I heard 'Zahra' in a dream
in a place
like a temple built
from granite rock
its building blocks
 
I didn't know why
or what it means,
I looked it up
and saw 'the brilliance
of feminine flowering'
 
Whether Egyptian or Arabic
means little to me,
what matters is
the homecoming
and opening
 
A new grounding
for my ancient roots
that allow the buds
of my Self
to drink
from the deep well
on the hill
of solid rock
upon which
my house
is built
in The Silver Mountains
who like an old friend
are beckoning
me home
to myself
where I can feel
safe and
cared for
nourished by the land,
and to the land belonging,
like everyone, and any,
like the many
generations before me.

Like old rusty iron
Nature is reclaiming me
I've got twigs in my hair,
stars behind my ears,
and spiders on my shirt
 
Slowly
I am becoming
a part of the webs
that She weaves
 
I am the crisp sparkling morning,
and the pink twilight eve's
 
I am the honoring
of nature's beckoning
to grow with spring,
sleep by winter,
and in the autumn
to fall like the leafs
 
I am the knowing
that the winds that be blowing,
waters flowing,
are none other than me
 
I am the understanding
of the language
that the birds are singing,
lilac trees whispering,
that the ants are building,
bees are buzzing,
the deer are calling,
rain is drumming,
fire crackling
 
The grace that everything
is bringing
like festive bells is ringing
in my heart
in my lungs
in my ears.
 
This grace
that rings
like festive bells
in the heart of this place
and the glow of my face.

<p>I have joint-related disabilities which challenge my ability my to exercize (it hurts to move, but I am better off if I move). I am diabetic, asthmatic, and have other stupid health issues. I benefit from exercise. At War, people walk everywhere they go, on grass paths and dirt roads. This is an ideal workout for me!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>I also have a trauma-related anxiety disorder and PTSD. In the past decade, these conditions got so bad that I was no longer able to work or play in the SCA. I am now under excellent treatment, and making exceptional progress. My treatment team tailors treatment to my needs, and are creative in there approach.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>My therapist has been encoraging me to get out and socialize again; the SCA has been a good place to start. A good friend generously brought me to a few local events this winter. I am happy to report that I am starting to make new friends and feel less afraid around them! As a result, my therapist has encouraged me to return to Pennsic War as a form of therapy! How cool is that? Pennsic War is the natural next step. </p>

<p>As two-week vacations go, Pennsic is relatively cheap because it is camping. Participnts bring everything they need with them, including shelter. This is far more doable than going on a cruise, or checking into a spa...and it is friendlier!</p>
<p>I am on a fixed income, and can cover <i>some</i> of my expenses. I am making my own garb (because we dress in period clothes the whole two weeks!) from fabric I already had. I am borrowing much of the equipment, such as a tent, cooler, and a rainfly. Friends and strangers have gifted me with garb accessories. Some items I am making from scratch (a woolen camp quilt) or repurposing from everyday use (plant stand becomes camp stool/table! Woolen blanket becomes cloak!).</p>

I am really, really excited to be going to Pennsic War in a few weeks. I know I will be able to fully relax for a change, knowing my needs have been covered!

I will post updates from the event, here on on the Facebook page, when possible. It is a bit tricky, as both wifi and electric outlets are scarce. I will do my best.



Please, everyone, send me your mailing address, so I can send you your perks! Indiegogo does NOT supply me with that information, nor does Paypal.

Please be sure to read my updates for the latest information about this campaign.


••••
I am Lady Aoife í Dalasýsla, also known as Siací Ross. I am an active participant in the Society for Creative Anachronism, an organization dedicated to learning about the medieval past through living and doing. I have been ""playing,"" as we call it, with the SCA for about 28 years. The Pennsic War is the SCA's largest camping event, with over 10,000 people gathering in western Pennsylvania for two weeks every year. This is the 44th year of this event, and the 49th year of the SCA in general.

I have joint-related disabilities which challenge my ability my to exercize (it hurts to move, but I am better off if I move). I am diabetic, asthmatic, and have other stupid health issues. I benefit from exercise. At War, people walk everywhere they go, on grass paths and dirt roads. This is an ideal workout for me!


I also have a trauma-related anxiety disorder and PTSD. In the past decade, these conditions got so bad that I was no longer able to work or play in the SCA. I am now under excellent treatment, and making exceptional progress. My treatment team tailors treatment to my needs, and are creative in there approach.

My therapist has been encoraging me to get out and socialize again; the SCA has been a good place to start. A good friend generously brought me to a few local events this winter. I am happy to report that I am starting to make new friends and feel less afraid around them! As a result, my therapist has encouraged me to return to Pennsic War as a form of therapy! How cool is that? Pennsic War is the natural next step. 
I really want to go! Your donation will get me there!

     



Going to Pennsic War gives me an opportunity to slow down and heal. I will, unplug from all electronics while I was there. My sleep will be guided by the rising and setting sun, highly benficial as I have had chronic insomnia for decades!  I will exchange city streets for footpaths and fresh air, eat when I am hungry, rest when I need to, and I will slow down in general.


This is the part of SCA life that makes this plan possible: SCAdiens themselves. ❤️

The SCA has a culture I am familiar with, one that expects — insists — that people to behave with courtesy and respect. If I drop something, someone will return it. If I feel ill, immediately people will help if they can (there is medical staff & EMTs on hand as well). If someone messes with me, several burly men and strapping lasses will appear and ask, ""Is this gentle bothering you, m'lady?"" And security makes the miscreant go away! People walk each other home at night as a matter of routine. People make sure their companions, and strangers, stay hydrated and fed. It is a very supportive place to be.

<h3>The Cause:</h3>
<p>We want to get Littmann Cardiology III Stethoscopes for the Handa Emergency Hospital in Battambang Cambodia.</p>
<p>The Handa Emergency Hospital was originally founded as a surgical trauma center for landmine victims. Its surgeons and nurses provide high quality care for those who are poor and disadvantaged in northwestern Cambodia, an area still littered with mines.</p>
<p>The Handa Foundation also has a mission to increase the human capital of the Cambodian medical sector. They are training the next generation of Cambodian doctors, nurses and surgeons.</p>
<p>See a video from the Handa Foundation<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=336247373106519&amp;set=vb.317971951600728&amp;type=2&amp;theater"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> HERE.</a></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need:</h3>
<p>The staff of the hospital work very hard to provide a high level of care with very few resources. They are training a new set of internal medicine students, but these students <strong>don't even have stethoscopes</strong>. They only need <strong>10</strong>, and it is very difficult to get high quality stethoscopes in Cambodia. We are trying to get them as many as we can. We have set our goal as $600 so that we can hopefully purchase <strong>4 </strong>of those stethoscopes.</p>
<p>The stethoscopes we are purchasing cost about <strong>$145</strong> each if bought as a set. They will be coming from Medisave.net, and a link to the product is below.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.medisave.net/littmann-stethoscopes/littmann-cardiology-iii-stethoscope/littmann-cardiology.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.medisave.net/littmann-stethoscopes/littmann-cardiology-iii-stethoscope/littmann-cardiology.html</a></p>
<p><strong>We only need 10</strong> of these stethoscopes and we are hoping to raise <strong>$600</strong> at a minimum, ideally we would like the full <strong>$1,450</strong>. Every cent of this fundraiser that we raise will help us get more stethoscopes to these doctors and students. If we get less than $1,450, we will buy as many scopes as we can.</p>
<p><strong>If we exceed the amount needed</strong>, all the extra money will be donated directly to the hospital to provide for their poor patients fund. Here is a story about the poor patients fund as told by the Nursing Director of the hospital, Chiara Gifford:</p>
<p>""Two weeks ago a woman came into the medical clinic in a coma.  She is 37 years old with three children.  She was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism that caused her to go into atrial fibrillation that caused her to have a stroke that caused her to go into a diabetic coma.   We straightened out the blood sugar and thyroid and gave her anticoagulation and after two weeks she went home even being able to move her right leg and arm, though still needing rehab.  Her entire visit cost $309.00 but the poor patients’ fund had only $14.00 left in it.  She is a rice farmer’s wife and they have no money to pay.  They will spend several years trying to pay us the $295.00.""</p>
<p>Regardless of how much money we raise, all of it will go towards strengthening this hospital and providing for the poor and disadvantaged of Cambodia.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact:</h3>
<p>The Handa Hospital is the only high level trauma care center in northwestern Cambodia. If this facility didn't exist, the closest comparable facility is 5 hours away in Phnom Penh. The addition of these stethoscopes will help this hospital better serve the people of Cambodia, and save many lives.</p>
<p>Your contribution will make a substantial difference in this community. You will be providing a doctor with a basic tool for treating patients, allowing them to save lives in a country still afflicted by the memories of war.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't give, we understand. Regardless, we would really appreciate it if you would spread the word to all your friends and family. Please help us make this spread!</p>
<p><br/>Thanks!</p>

<p>For my undergraduate thesis, I created a course using flying trapeze as a form of experiential therapy. As soon as I learned to fly, I started to feel the healing effects that trapeze has to offer. When I started teaching flying trapeze, I saw how it healed others as well. Throughout the past year, I have researched how the healing processes work and how flying through the air might be therapeutic.  As a culmination of my thesis, I am going to build a flying trapeze on the Hampshire College campus the weekend of May 11th, to offer free classes and single swings to students, as well as staff and faculty. My hope is that this project will help me continue my research as well as help students de-stress after finals, have fun and try something they have never done before. You can help by donating anything from $1 to $100 dollars. Truly, anything helps. I have an amazing team helping me put this together, but we still need some money to get it going. With your help, I hope to be able to pay everyone who has put so much hard work and time into making this happen. I believe that flying trapeze can help people overcome their fears and take a leap into the unknown, which can lead to finding the courage to pursue other things in life.  </p>
<p>If you donate, you will have priority in taking a swing or a full class during the weekend we will have the rig up. I want to give everyone a try, but there is limited space in each class. If you can’t donate, please tell others about my campaign and get the word out! Anything helps!</p>

There is no other tricycle like the eChariot on the market today.  The extreme comfort of the seat, size and power of the wheels, strong motor and sleek design, truly allows you to ""ride like an emperor.""  The eChariot is very utilitarian and includes a stylish and spacious basket for trips to the grocery store, transporting your pet or carrying a cooler for a fun day at the beach.  The tricycle can travel a distance of 15 to 20 miles at speeds up to 20 MPH before needing to be recharged.  There is no other tricycle like the eChariot and we are offering it for the extremely low price of $699. 


The Current Specifications for the eCariot are:




500 watt motor with capability of speeds up to 20 mph, but ""governed"" at time of sale to max out at 12 mph for safety. Can be adjusted. 


36 volt, 22 amp motor controller


Variable speed throttle with single speed pedaling


LiFePO4 lithium ion 36 volt, 10ah battery. 


26""x4"" wheels


Front hub direct drive motor


Front and rear disc brakes

<p>I’m Bevin Branlandingham, the Femmecee and Founder of Fat Kid Dance Party aerobics (For All Sizes to Heal from Body Oppression). It’s a safe(r) space in LA for people of all sizes to feel good about their bodies, boost their joy, and rip up the dance floor. Now, I want to take the same message to everyone, regardless of location!</p>
<p>I created the class in response to bullying and other traumatic experiences I had growing up and living fat in the world. I internalized the messages that being fat is bad, and that I should be ashamed of what I looked like. Whenever I would try to dance or move in any way in public, I felt a lot of judgement that made me want to stop moving altogether. Most people who have been fat know that shame doesn’t create weight loss. (In this fatphobic society, if shame worked <i>everyone</i> would be thin!)</p>
<p>After serving as a thought leader in the body positive movement for over a decade, I’ve decided to create the kind of dance class I wish I had when I was a kid, and throughout my life. Something that wasn’t about weight loss or making our bodies look like those in a magazine, but <strong>focused on radically affirming all bodies</strong>. Something that helps to build not just self esteem but self love. And most importantly something that at its core helps to spark that deep fire of joy that lives in all bodies—but perhaps has been dormant in some of us for far too long. </p>
<p>PopSugar did a video about my class this summer and the response has been overwhelming. Almost 4 million people have seen the video and the number one response has been: “How can I get this class where I live?” Now, I want to bring it to everyone who needs a cheerleader worldwide! But I need your help to do it… </p>
<p>I am creating <strong>a Fat Kid Dance Party workout series</strong> that people can download and dance along with right in their living room. Production costs are particularly high for these types of videos, especially licensing for awesome music, which I believe is a key element of sparking joy. I’ve bought hundred dollar workouts with only one recognizable song and felt so let down by that - so the more money we raise the more fab music we can license, the higher the production value for the videos and the more I can move towards creating a body affirming movement series!</p>
<p>If you’re interested in affirming joyful movement class or learning some hot new moves to tear up the dance floor…</p>
<p>Support this project by pre-ordering now and sharing with your friends!!!</p>
<p>I can’t wait to party with you!</p>
<p>One more thing: I call this class Fat Kid Dance Party (For All Sizes to Heal from Body Oppression) because <strong>body negativity affects everyone</strong>. I want to be your cheerleader for resilience no matter what size you are because all bodies are worthy of love exactly as they are right now!</p>
