It’s rewarding to know that beyond the initial film festival runs and broadcasts, that the French, Portuguese and English versions of this film will be used by organisations across the world to effect change and save lives for years to come.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479204083/yqn4kthk9e9tquealmru.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h2><strong>THE TEAM</strong></h2><p><strong>Yaba Badoe - Film Director</strong></p><p>Yaba Badoe is an award-winning Ghanaian-British documentary film maker and writer with many years’ experience in broadcast television. She trained with the BBC and has made arts and culture based documentaries for the main terrestrial channels in the UK.  </p><p>In 2003 she directed a one hour documentary about the life and work of Nobel Laureate, Toni Morrison, for BBC4.  In 2010, Yaba set up Fadoa Films, through which she’s made The Witches of Gambaga, winner of the Best Documentary Award 2010 at the Black International Film Festival in Britain, and 2nd Prize, Documentaries 2011 at FESPACO. In 2014 she completed The Art of Ama Ata Aidoo about the life and work of iconic, African feminist writer, Ama Ata Aidoo and was nominated for a Distinguished Woman of African Cinema Award by the Women Filmmakers of Zimbabwe.</p><p>She acknowledges that her recent documentaries could not have been made without the support of the women’s movement in Ghana and internationally. Netright, an association of women’s organisations in Ghana uses The Witches of Gambaga to campaign to prevent violence against women believed to be witches. The film is shown to every student at the University of Ghana in the hope that they will question age-old religious beliefs that associate women’s sexuality with the dark arts. In Western Kenya, where there is a high incidence of witch burning, Amnesty International uses the film to raise awareness of human rights.</p><p>Her passion is to tell women’s stories in a way that allows them to speak for themselves. At the same time, she thinks it’s crucial to situate her subjects in a social and economic context, so that everyone watching her films begins to understand the gender regimes that shape and constrain women’s lives in Africa. Her aim is to inform, educate and generate empathy to change a status quo that often sensationalises and patronises women from non-Western cultures.</p><p><strong>Sharon Farr - Film Producer</strong> </p><p>Sharon has produced, directed, researched and scripted hundreds of hours of factual programming across the actuality genres over the past 23 years. She has worked extensively in Africa and runs South African company Shoot the Breeze Productions with Lee Otten.</p><p>Her work has received numerous local and international awards including World Awards at the Asia Media Summit for the Best Documentary Promoting Religious Understanding and Tolerance with <i>Good Vibrations</i> and Best Documentary on HIV for <i>Masindy’s Story</i> as well as a SAFTA for Best Magazine Show with the mind body spirit series <i>Free Spirit</i>.</p><p>A career highlight was making the documentary feature <i>Love, Communism, Revolution &amp; Rivonia: Bram Fischer’s Story </i>that was voted Best South African Documentary at the Encounters Festival in 2007.</p><p>She has a passion for human rights issues and telling positive and inspiring African stories that effect change. She loves the collaborative nature of filmmaking and it’s the creative interplay between content and visuals when shooting and editing that excites her most.</p><p><strong>Melania Chiponda, Regional Campaign Coordinator, WoMin</strong></p><p>Melania has expertise in movement building, action oriented research and development of advocacy strategies. She has vast experience working with grassroots women affected by mineral resource extraction and has worked with a leading grassroots movement in Zimbabwe which represents women and communities impacted by mining induced involuntary displacements.</p><p>Her research and advocacy work engages with global extractive industries from the perspective of grassroots women that are directly affected by mining, and is embedded in a participatory action research approach. An overarching theme of her research involves women’s land rights, environmental and climate justice. Melania has vast experience supporting grassroots women’s efforts to take creative advocacy actions, and she took a leading role in raising the profile of violence against women in the extractives industry through diverse strategies. Melania holds an MSc in Development Studies from Women’s University in Africa.</p><p><strong>Samantha Hargreaves - Regional Director, WoMin</strong></p><p>Samantha Hargreaves is a land, agrarian and extractive industry specialist, promoting analysis and organising by women in South Africa and the rest of the continent.

Our work will also feature in the film with our staff providing the overarching commentary, context and eco-feminist political analysis for the experiential stories and realities of the women’s lives and struggles for justice. HOW THE FILM WILL BE USEDNo Good Comes from the Mine will be produced in English, French and Portuguese and WoMin and our alliance partners will use it for training, political education, lobbying and advocacy.It will cultivate greater awareness of the costs of extractives-oriented development, and it’s particularly gendered costs, amongst civil society organisations and the wider public and will be used to advocate and campaign for the needed alternatives to governments and multilateral bodies, like the African Union and the United Nations.The film plugs into global issues and conversations so we will also reach broader audiences via film festivals, licensed broadcast and social media. THEMES & APPROACHProduced with an eco-feminist framing, our film explores thematic issues around food and land rights, consent, militarisation, violence against women and access to water. The overarching theme is fossil fuel extraction and its immediate and long-term impacts: climate change.Our production process is participatory and feminist Ghanaian Director, Yaba Badoe, believes in character’s telling their own stories intimately and frankly.

At night we can’t sleep with the sound of the machines.” And beyond the torment of the machine noise, the blasting cracks their houses.Despite the fact that the area has been declared a disaster zone due to the prevailing drought, in March 2016 the mine announced that it would start to exploit underground water aquifers to maintain its operations. The mine uses vast water resources to wash their coal in preparation for export whilst women walk up to 25 kilometres to access drinking water. “They arrived and blocked our rivers so we can’t fetch water. Right now we don’t have water. We buy water.” says Smangele Nkosi of Somkhele.In nearby Fuleni, Ibutho Coal wants to open a new mine so women from Fuleni visit Somkhele on a fact finding mission. Khipile Msweli of Somkhele tells them that ""nothing good has come from the mine"". Smangele Nkosi warns the women of Fuleni to resist the development of the mine at all costs saying that at first the mine will promise you beautiful things so that you agree but won’t honour any of their promises.

So it is in this context that there is growing urgency for women’s voices to be heard and amplified in oil debates and for the support of demonstration gardens and indigenous seed exchange and sharing programmes spearheaded by women.The main characters in No Good Comes from the Mine will be women from the Buliisa oil area, Kigaga Oil Refinery Affected Association, and Kwataniza Women Farmer's Group led by dynamic rights activists Beatrice Rukanyanga, Kagole Margaret, Jessica Buteraba and Alice Musimenta.The film will also focus on the Rwamutonga community where an estimated 500 families of over 2000 people have been dispossessed of their land and access to forests and water bodies by oil drilling and are now located in resettlement camps.The women will tell their stories about the challenges they face and how they manage them, revealing how they are mobilizing to counter the drilling companies, government structures, patriarchal leaders and men in their communities who are violating their rights. They will also express their vision of a ‘good life’ and what they expect from their government.WoMin and the film’s director, Yaba Badoe, will make the Uganda part of the film in collaboration with The National Association of Professional Environmentalists (NAPE). It will show how these two organisations and the National Association for Women's Action in Development, Kakindo Orphans Care and the Gaia Foundation work with the women to help them survive, resist and effect change.Their work with local and national organisations conducting research, supporting local alternatives around food, water and energy, and building a broad coalition to advance macro-economic development alternatives to the dominant extractives driven plan will also feature in the film where it is relevant to the women’s stories.​The existing fundraising trailer focusing on the South African part of the film will be updated to include the Uganda story. FUTURE FILMING IN DRC & POST-PRODUCTIONAny additional funds raised in this campaign will go towards crew, equipment and travel costs for our third and final stage of filming in the DRC where the Inga mega hydropower scheme is threatening the lives and livelihoods of thousands of people.Filming in DRC is planned for June/July 2017. We will be raising the production budget of $36 000 for filming in DRC and the post-production budget of $40 000 via traditional organisational fundraising channels and film funds. If necessary, we will run two additional Indiegogo campaigns to complete fundraising for the production budget for the final stage of filming in DRC and to cover post-production costs. Post-production is scheduled to start in August 2017 with transcriptions, translations and edit preparation of footage from the final phase of filming in DRC and editing in October and November 2017. HOW TO SUPPORT USWe really need help to get this film made, and anything you can do to support it is great.Contribute whatever you can.

Big mining companies are exploiting natural resources at the expense of local communities East and West, North and South with impunity. It can be stopped but only if we work together to help women in exploited communities to rise up and change their situation.  Your contribution will make a very real difference in helping thousands of women in communities across Africa and the world mobilise against exploitative extractives and the effects of climate change.From our experience, the best thing about making a documentary that will be used for training and advocacy is the ongoing usage. It’s rewarding to know that beyond the initial film festival runs and broadcasts, that the French, Portuguese and English versions of this film will be used by organisations across the world to effect change and save lives for years to come.THE TEAMYaba Badoe - Film DirectorYaba Badoe is an award-winning Ghanaian-British documentary film maker and writer with many years’ experience in broadcast television. She trained with the BBC and has made arts and culture based documentaries for the main terrestrial channels in the UK.  In 2003 she directed a one hour documentary about the life and work of Nobel Laureate, Toni Morrison, for BBC4.  In 2010, Yaba set up Fadoa Films, through which she’s made The Witches of Gambaga, winner of the Best Documentary Award 2010 at the Black International Film Festival in Britain, and 2nd Prize, Documentaries 2011 at FESPACO. In 2014 she completed The Art of Ama Ata Aidoo about the life and work of iconic, African feminist writer, Ama Ata Aidoo and was nominated for a Distinguished Woman of African Cinema Award by the Women Filmmakers of Zimbabwe.She acknowledges that her recent documentaries could not have been made without the support of the women’s movement in Ghana and internationally. Netright, an association of women’s organisations in Ghana uses The Witches of Gambaga to campaign to prevent violence against women believed to be witches. The film is shown to every student at the University of Ghana in the hope that they will question age-old religious beliefs that associate women’s sexuality with the dark arts. In Western Kenya, where there is a high incidence of witch burning, Amnesty International uses the film to raise awareness of human rights.Her passion is to tell women’s stories in a way that allows them to speak for themselves. At the same time, she thinks it’s crucial to situate her subjects in a social and economic context, so that everyone watching her films begins to understand the gender regimes that shape and constrain women’s lives in Africa. Her aim is to inform, educate and generate empathy to change a status quo that often sensationalises and patronises women from non-Western cultures.Sharon Farr - Film Producer Sharon has produced, directed, researched and scripted hundreds of hours of factual programming across the actuality genres over the past 23 years. She has worked extensively in Africa and runs South African company Shoot the Breeze Productions with Lee Otten.Her work has received numerous local and international awards including World Awards at the Asia Media Summit for the Best Documentary Promoting Religious Understanding and Tolerance with Good Vibrations and Best Documentary on HIV for Masindy’s Story as well as a SAFTA for Best Magazine Show with the mind body spirit series Free Spirit.A career highlight was making the documentary feature Love, Communism, Revolution & Rivonia: Bram Fischer’s Story that was voted Best South African Documentary at the Encounters Festival in 2007.She has a passion for human rights issues and telling positive and inspiring African stories that effect change. She loves the collaborative nature of filmmaking and it’s the creative interplay between content and visuals when shooting and editing that excites her most.Melania Chiponda, Regional Campaign Coordinator, WoMinMelania has expertise in movement building, action oriented research and development of advocacy strategies. She has vast experience working with grassroots women affected by mineral resource extraction and has worked with a leading grassroots movement in Zimbabwe which represents women and communities impacted by mining induced involuntary displacements.Her research and advocacy work engages with global extractive industries from the perspective of grassroots women that are directly affected by mining, and is embedded in a participatory action research approach. An overarching theme of her research involves women’s land rights, environmental and climate justice. Melania has vast experience supporting grassroots women’s efforts to take creative advocacy actions, and she took a leading role in raising the profile of violence against women in the extractives industry through diverse strategies. Melania holds an MSc in Development Studies from Women’s University in Africa.Samantha Hargreaves - Regional Director, WoMinSamantha Hargreaves is a land, agrarian and extractive industry specialist, promoting analysis and organising by women in South Africa and the rest of the continent.

<p>We've all had dreams of becoming a Ghostbuster; I know I have personally since childhood.

<p><strong>Background of the movie</strong></p>
<p>The original idea of ​​this film emerged from a true story where a group of young people wanted to pursue their dream by emigrating to the United States. Unfortunately, only one person survived.</p>
<p>Caught by this story, the main actor and his production team wanted to produce a movie to honor all people who are trying to get ahead and follow their dreams no matter what the sacrifice is.</p>
<p>A paradise can turn into flames. This phrase describes the genre of the film. Despite being a fiction movie, it is based on three true stories and is best described as a comedy, action and martial arts film.<br/>The film exposes the culture and the beauty of the cities of the Caribbean countries such as Cuba, Curacao and Aruba. In addition, some parts of the movie take place in United States and The Netherlands.   </p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Ricardo, a Cuban native and martial artist feels the need to emigrate to the United States to pursue his dreams to achieve a better life for himself and his family. During this journey to the United States, he loses five friends at sea. Ricardo is the only survivor and has been picked up by a yacht heading to Curacao, The Dutch Antilles.</p>
<p>Upon his arrival at the island, Ricardo searches for a job in which he can earn enough money to help support his family in Cuba. In his desperate need and naive choice of making easy money, he gets involved with a gang of extortionists who wrongly accuse him of stealing from them. This forces him to immediately flee to Cuba. His pursuers follow him and try to not only extort him, but also his family. <br/>Ricardo wants to know who is responsible for those actions. He returns to Curacao to take revenge on the real culprit. Only the strong, like Ricardo, can sufficiently overcome all these setbacks. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Actor: Abelardo Destrade Mora</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485391409/ysipkdv29xo6ffksh3o2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The main character Ricardo is played by Abelardo Destrade Mora, who was born and raised in Cuba. He is an engineer in computer science and a master in three different martial arts styles. He also has a black belt in karate, taekwondo, judo, military art and wing chun.

</div></div>","Background of the movie
The original idea of ​​this film emerged from a true story where a group of young people wanted to pursue their dream by emigrating to the United States. Unfortunately, only one person survived.
Caught by this story, the main actor and his production team wanted to produce a movie to honor all people who are trying to get ahead and follow their dreams no matter what the sacrifice is.
A paradise can turn into flames. This phrase describes the genre of the film. Despite being a fiction movie, it is based on three true stories and is best described as a comedy, action and martial arts film.The film exposes the culture and the beauty of the cities of the Caribbean countries such as Cuba, Curacao and Aruba. In addition, some parts of the movie take place in United States and The Netherlands.   
Short Summary
Ricardo, a Cuban native and martial artist feels the need to emigrate to the United States to pursue his dreams to achieve a better life for himself and his family. During this journey to the United States, he loses five friends at sea. Ricardo is the only survivor and has been picked up by a yacht heading to Curacao, The Dutch Antilles.
Upon his arrival at the island, Ricardo searches for a job in which he can earn enough money to help support his family in Cuba. In his desperate need and naive choice of making easy money, he gets involved with a gang of extortionists who wrongly accuse him of stealing from them. This forces him to immediately flee to Cuba. His pursuers follow him and try to not only extort him, but also his family. Ricardo wants to know who is responsible for those actions. He returns to Curacao to take revenge on the real culprit. Only the strong, like Ricardo, can sufficiently overcome all these setbacks. 
 
Actor: Abelardo Destrade Mora

The main character Ricardo is played by Abelardo Destrade Mora, who was born and raised in Cuba. He is an engineer in computer science and a master in three different martial arts styles. He also has a black belt in karate, taekwondo, judo, military art and wing chun. In Cuba, he fought in 27 fights, as a military arts specialist, without any defeat.Abelardo is one of the first in the world in the specialty of Wing Chun and the first one of introducing this Chinese martial arts style in Curacao. Besides this, he is also the first person that introduced exercises with two knives for the wooden dummy.

<h3>What This Is</h3>
<p>""The Back Room"" is an undergraduate thesis film at Boston University about a man with an addiction to pornography, and how this addiction affects his life. We're taking the skills we've learned over the past three years at BU and combining them into one larger production.</p>
<p>Our project will be filmed at the end of November, with a rough cut assembled mid-December to present to the Film Department faculty. We'll then spend the next semester polishing the film in post-production, and will present to the BU community in May.</p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>In order to make this film happen, we need to raise $1,500. Here's where that money is going:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Locations</strong>: we need to rent a suburban ranch-style house for Harold's home, and get back and forth from Boston to the set.</li>
<li>
<strong>Production Design</strong>: we need to dress the set to look like Harold lives there, and doesn't take good care of his home. We also need tons of other props, such as a chicken to burn and some toys to play with.</li>
<li>
<strong>Craft Services</strong>: a full crew is a happy crew! Because we're filming in a distant location, we need to feed and house our cast and crew during the weekend of shooting.</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>""All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."" –Tolstoy</p>
<p>We are making this film for the unhappy families - to raise awareness about addiction and family issues in general. Too often in films, these topics pushed aside in favor of others that may be more entertaining or easy to watch. We want to bring attention to these issues and–although it is true that no unhappy family is alike–maybe create something that a few of those unhappy families will be able to identify with.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any film project, we expect there will be twists and turns in the process. Here're some of the challenges we might see:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>One weekend of shooting:</strong> because of academic and cast schedules, we are trying to shoot our entire 12-page film in one weekend. To make that weekend as smooth as possible, we're planning out each shooting day as efficiently as possible, so that when the time comes we can spend as little time as possible on logistics, and maximize our filming time.</li>
<li>
<strong>Location booking:</strong> our film takes place in a small suburban home, which are few and expensive in the Boston area. So, we're looking for locations outside of Boston that will be cheaper and allow our cast and crew to stay overnight, so we can create the setting we're looking for.</li>
<li>
<strong>Raising enough money</strong>: thesis films are expensive! The amount of money that we raise will affect how much we can spend on production design and special equipment, as well as how many festivals we're be able to submit to.</li>

Siira's documentaries include THE COLOUR OF LOVE, MEET + EAST and ON THE LINE.HOW THE FUNDS WILL BE USEDFat Kid Films have raised a minimal amount of the budget independently though private investment or donation, sponsorships, goods and services services.   We are seeking $3,500 to ensure that the film will be realised. We understand how difficult it is in these times to ask people to part with there hard earned money which is why you can donate as little as $10 to be part of the film and feel pleased that you support and ensure this uniquely drawn film be realised. As you will see our limited budget of $3,500 is extremely low for a short film, and every cent is accounted for.  Where we are stretched on the budget is the catering. A well fed crew is a happy crew and we very much need to cater for these people, who will be working long hours for very little reward. Without the support of Film Victoria and Screen Australia, independent films run the risk of collapsing without some philanthropic assistance from generous organisations and companies interested in supporting the film industry.It is very valuable for the film if you share our film's journey with your friends, family, colleagues and through other social media platforms.   Please share this crowd funding page and spread the word using Indiegogo's sharing tools.Like Page: https://www.facebook.com/hiddenwellmovie/Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/hiddenwell2016/With much gratitude.",5.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</p><p><b>THE FILM:
'SEMPRE':</b></p>
<p>My short
film is called 'Sempre' -  it's an Italian word that's used as a musical
direction meaning ""always"" or ""throughout"". </p>
<p>What would
happen if one day you get struck by a lightning bolt, you wake up from your
coma to find that the traumatic injury you sustained in one part of the brain
has unlocked hidden talents in another part? Do you remain the same person, or
does the new re-wiring of your brain alter you to a person you’ve never known
before? 'Sempre' is a short film dramatizing a case of Acquired
Savant Syndrome, in which a mild-mannered, middle-aged businessman transforms
into an obsessive musical genius.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469284000/13701178_10154207945230605_897791471228789128_o_csmc4l.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p><br/>
<p>We follow
the story of a bland, harmless, middle-aged Russell Gray who seems to have it all:
a flourishing business, a loving wife, Karen and a talented daughter, Fiona.
After sustaining brain damage that initially passes unnoticed, he develops a
rare neurological disorder which enables his brain
to unleash incredible musical abilities and relentless auditory hallucinations.
As he refuses treatment, he slowly grows obsessive with his ""gifts""
and morphs into a person very different to who we met in the beginning of the
film, alienating his family, losing his business, and ultimately himself. 
It's a story about how fickle we human beings are and how the slightest
re-wiring in our brains could alter the core of what makes us who we are so
drastically. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469283934/Capture03_jb5xbh.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p><b>What am I
about, exactly?</b><br/>
Not a whole lot. I chose journalism as my major in undergraduate school partly
because I had a thing or two for writing, but mostly because it was the major
that offered its students the most electives. What could go wrong?  I
studied news writing but also philosophy and history. I took up an astronomy
module, a film analysis seminar, and in my senior year, I got graded on my
singing. I could even spare a study abroad year in Japan that counted towards
my credits. By the time I graduated, I was ready for what Egypt had in stock
for its population of prospective journalists: turbulence, uncertainty, death
tolls, a landscape constantly changing beyond recognition and a bottomless hat
of stories about human beings trying to come to terms with it all. Having
worked two years in news reporting for print and radio, I realized that there's
got to be a better way to tell all these stories, a way that doesn't reduce
their subjects to a number in a headline or a source at the tail of a quote. I
just found myself gravitating towards film. An application season later, I got
myself a scholarship to go study Digital Film and TV Production in the
University of York. <br/></p><p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Learning
Filmmaking</b></p>
<p>I've spent
the last few months on a roller coaster of a self-discovery experience. I
started out as a film fan, and by now I have learned how to dismantle a
£65,000 industry-standard camera, how to light a set and not kill myself
or burn my hair in the process of doing it, how Alfred Hitchcock could have
pulled his other-worldly works of genius off, how I can write my own film
script, and down the line, direct it. Most of all, I've learnt the sheer
capacity of hard labour that creating a film entails, the logistical mountains
that stand in the way, the masses of people shooting a scene involves, and how
absolutely rejuvenating it must feel to see the fruit of your work communicated
to people you've never met, and in ideal world, move them. </p>
<p>The learning
curve has been so steep it's a miracle I haven't broken my neck (yet). Now it's
time to put it all to test. I've written my first short twenty-minute film as
part of my course, and now is the time to turn the words on the page into
pictures on the screen. In order to make this film, I need a crew (people who
help me on set but don't appear on the screen), a cast (those who do appear on
the screen), shooting locations and to be able to move the crew, cast,
equipment and myself to these locations. Each single component of these
requires money. Money I don't have much of, being an Egyptian student in the UK
surviving off of a scholarship bursary and all. In order to graduate, I don't
get to write a dissertation about film, I get to make one. </p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>My university is providing about 15%
of the funds I need for the film, I'm cutting down my own living costs to chip
in with something. I do realize GBP 1500 might seem like a massive sum, but
here's the breakdown of where the costs will go:</p>
<p></p>
<p><span>·<span>  </span></span>Equipment
transportation: £ 200</p>
<p><span>·<span>  </span></span>Crew and Cast
expenses: £ 500</p>
<p><span>·<span>  </span></span>Location
expenses: £ 200</p>
<p><span>·<span>  </span></span>Catering: £ 300</p>
<p><span>·<span>  </span></span>Production
design: £ 300</p>
<p><b>Why £ 1500?</b></p>

<br/></div>","THE FILM:
'SEMPRE':
My short
film is called 'Sempre' -  it's an Italian word that's used as a musical
direction meaning ""always"" or ""throughout"". 
What would
happen if one day you get struck by a lightning bolt, you wake up from your
coma to find that the traumatic injury you sustained in one part of the brain
has unlocked hidden talents in another part? Do you remain the same person, or
does the new re-wiring of your brain alter you to a person you’ve never known
before? 'Sempre' is a short film dramatizing a case of Acquired
Savant Syndrome, in which a mild-mannered, middle-aged businessman transforms
into an obsessive musical genius.
We follow
the story of a bland, harmless, middle-aged Russell Gray who seems to have it all:
a flourishing business, a loving wife, Karen and a talented daughter, Fiona.
After sustaining brain damage that initially passes unnoticed, he develops a
rare neurological disorder which enables his brain
to unleash incredible musical abilities and relentless auditory hallucinations.
As he refuses treatment, he slowly grows obsessive with his ""gifts""
and morphs into a person very different to who we met in the beginning of the
film, alienating his family, losing his business, and ultimately himself. 
It's a story about how fickle we human beings are and how the slightest
re-wiring in our brains could alter the core of what makes us who we are so
drastically. 
What am I
about, exactly?
Not a whole lot. I chose journalism as my major in undergraduate school partly
because I had a thing or two for writing, but mostly because it was the major
that offered its students the most electives. What could go wrong?  I
studied news writing but also philosophy and history. I took up an astronomy
module, a film analysis seminar, and in my senior year, I got graded on my
singing. I could even spare a study abroad year in Japan that counted towards
my credits. By the time I graduated, I was ready for what Egypt had in stock
for its population of prospective journalists: turbulence, uncertainty, death
tolls, a landscape constantly changing beyond recognition and a bottomless hat
of stories about human beings trying to come to terms with it all. Having
worked two years in news reporting for print and radio, I realized that there's
got to be a better way to tell all these stories, a way that doesn't reduce
their subjects to a number in a headline or a source at the tail of a quote. I
just found myself gravitating towards film. An application season later, I got
myself a scholarship to go study Digital Film and TV Production in the
University of York. 

Learning
Filmmaking
I've spent
the last few months on a roller coaster of a self-discovery experience. I
started out as a film fan, and by now I have learned how to dismantle a
£65,000 industry-standard camera, how to light a set and not kill myself
or burn my hair in the process of doing it, how Alfred Hitchcock could have
pulled his other-worldly works of genius off, how I can write my own film
script, and down the line, direct it. Most of all, I've learnt the sheer
capacity of hard labour that creating a film entails, the logistical mountains
that stand in the way, the masses of people shooting a scene involves, and how
absolutely rejuvenating it must feel to see the fruit of your work communicated
to people you've never met, and in ideal world, move them. 
The learning
curve has been so steep it's a miracle I haven't broken my neck (yet). Now it's
time to put it all to test. I've written my first short twenty-minute film as
part of my course, and now is the time to turn the words on the page into
pictures on the screen. In order to make this film, I need a crew (people who
help me on set but don't appear on the screen), a cast (those who do appear on
the screen), shooting locations and to be able to move the crew, cast,
equipment and myself to these locations. Each single component of these
requires money. Money I don't have much of, being an Egyptian student in the UK
surviving off of a scholarship bursary and all. In order to graduate, I don't
get to write a dissertation about film, I get to make one. 
What We Need & What You Get
My university is providing about 15%
of the funds I need for the film, I'm cutting down my own living costs to chip
in with something. I do realize GBP 1500 might seem like a massive sum, but
here's the breakdown of where the costs will go:

·  Equipment
transportation: £ 200
·  Crew and Cast
expenses: £ 500
·  Location
expenses: £ 200
·  Catering: £ 300
·  Production
design: £ 300
Why £ 1500?
I have been so lucky in that so many
talented filmmaking enthusiasts have approached me and expressed their will to
be part of my crew, totally free of charge. It’s a non-paid job, but I have to
reimburse everybody's transportation and lodging expenses, as well as provide
them with enough food to keep them going. I happen to have several crew members
coming from different parts of the UK into York. In addition, because my
casting requirements are quite particular (in addition to acting skills, I need
from three of my actors to have had piano playing experience as well), I
haven't been able to find local actors, and have had to reach out to ones in major
(and, unfortunately, further) cities like London and Manchester. 
If, by way
of a miracle, we surpass our goal, we will use the additional finds to submit
the film into different film festivals in and outside of the UK. 
What you get in Return?
Donors make the film. It's as simple
as that. With your help I would be able to create this film and use it as a
launching pad to future projects. While I almost have the talent donors nailed, now
I am in desperate need for the help of financial donors. 
Your
donations will be matched with varieties of rewards, from a digital copy of the
film, to an ""Associate Producer"" credit, depending on the amount you
decide to pledge. 
The Impact
What I love about our story in
'Sempre' is that, in theory, it could happen to any of us - we all have brains;
mysterious, powerful brains, which we know too little about.
It's my
first ever filmmaking experience, but I certainly hope it won't be my last. I
will do my best to make the best film I can, with the limited resources and
short experience I have, and turn it into a launching pad to other projects I
already have brewing in my head for when I go back to Egypt.

He approaches Abigail, and through a mix of wit and flirtation, and a bit of charming quirkiness, laments to Abigail on the sorry state of modern mainstream films.

<h3>Greater Danbury, CT Filmmakers To Produce Homegrown Horror Film</h3>As I was saying, my name is Angel Rosa and I'm a native of Western Connecticut, having been born and raised in the great 'Hat City' of Danbury; which runs smack-dab against the border with New York State. That gives us Hat City citizens a unique sensibility, mixing New England charm with a kind of New York wit and hipness. We tend to be introspective and witty, neighborly and gritty all at once. Artistically this produces a distinct creative style unique to the Greater Danbury region.  You can hear it in our music, see it in our art, and feel it in our poetry and storytelling. <br/><br/>Danbury has a rich history of movers and shakers from a variety of disciplines, themselves all products of that one-of-a-kind Hat City culture. From people like Charles Ives, son of a former marching band leader, who went on to become a world renowned composer, to folks like Jerry Nadeau, son of a former Danbury Race Arena modified car racer, who went from racing go-karts all the way to NASCAR.    <br/><br/>Then there's the story of me, Angel Rosa, a single father who still finds himself occasionally going to the Coinstar, or to the bottle redemption area at Stop &amp; Shop for gas money to get back and forth to work everyday. (You want to talk about humility?) Nevertheless, I am an incredibly proud parent, which in itself makes me profoundly rich in so many ways that money cannot. I'm the son of a U.S. Navy veteran, former police officer, and musician father currently retired from Yankee Gas/Connecticut Light &amp; Power after three decades of employment. I am also the son of an equally hard-working mother currently retired  from Pitney Bowes after almost two decades of employment. </div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div><div>

<h3><b>So why the heck should you trust <i>me</i>?</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Great question. Well, for starters, because I'm a parent. But not just a parent, I'm a single parent. In fact, I'm a single dad to an amazing young lady, who's 12 going on 21. She's not disrespectful, but she certainly isn't a pushover either. And she's been that way her entire life. I've raised my daughter alone since she was six, and I will tell you all, there are none more tender and understanding when it's appropriate to be, or more brutally honest when it's appropriate to be. (Even sometimes when it's maybe not so appropriate to be.) <br/><br/>Bottom line: She'd never let me get away with anything other than 100% commitment. And she never allows me to look down on myself. Trust me, I'm human, and every single one of us, especially us artists, flirt with self-consciousness from time to time, and we can often be our very own worst critics. With this little one in my life, there's no time for any of that bull. She picks me up the moment I start slipping. And, in reality, I just know better now. It's not all or nothing, it's ""Everything; absolutely and uncompromisingly so!""<br/><br/>This film is just as much for the audience, as it is for her, and for <b>all</b> the families of every single member of our team, which in itself is a creative family. I would be most honored if you could be a part of that family. <br/><br/>I ask you with the greatest humility: Please help us spread the word from sidewalk to rooftop.

My legacy, and that of so many others on this team, has yet to be written. But YOU can be a part of those legacies, by helping us in any way you can to make this film a reality. 
You can also be a part of adding to the rich cinematic history of Greater Danbury, a place where legendary filmmakers have come to make movies. People like Alfred Hitchcock, Paul Newman, Frank Oz, Norman Jewison, Bob Balaban, Rebecca Miller, Wes Craven, and so many others. 
Here's What We Need, and What You'll Get

We need to reach an absolute minimum goal of $10,000 to complete, The Tutor, the first module of the feature, with an ideal goal of $50,000 overall to get all of the modules produced and complete this entire film.  We will use every penny of the funds for pre-production planning, production, and post-production. Your contributions will go toward paying our lead actors, providing a modest stipend to crew, hiring production specialists like cinematographers, sound engineers, gaffers, special effects makeup artists, visual effects artists (all practical effects, by the way---NO CGI), logistics costs, production design, editing, color correction, and of course, catering to feed the cast and crew; probably the most important part! 


We have some amazing perks to offer our contributors; from having your name listed in the ""Special Thanks"" section of the closing credits, to earning yourself a SMOKING HOT Hat City Pictures t-shirts; from Contrived mini-posters, to dinner with the cast and crew. There are even spots available for 'Executive Producers', where'll you'll get to visit the set of the film, get full Executive Producer credit, and hang out with us while we make movie magic, and more!!!!
   It All Depends On YOU! The film promises to be a unique, fascinating, and entertaining examination of the current state of Hollywood. It's intended as a respectful nod to the great Hollywood of old, and a not-so-subtle indictment of the lack of originality currently evident in mainstream American cinema. 
With your financial support, we can put out something original and fresh. Something thought-provoking, genuinely unnerving, and ultimately loads of fun. 
If I may be allowed to do some moderate self back-patting, I'm very proud of my accomplishments as a published writer and filmmaker whose films have toured film festivals throughout Connecticut and New York. And I'm especially proud of my entire team, collectively boasting 30 years of Award Winning experience working on stage, television, and film. 
  Making movies, especially feature length movies, and especially feature length movies with original, creative content is NOT easy. And it's certainly NOT cheap. Frankly, and I will just be blunt here: without you, we're finished before we can even begin. This is a team building exercise, and very much one rooted in community support. Without you having our backs, well, it's going to make it next to impossible to get it done. We need your support, your solidarity, your commitment, your loyalty, and your love!

So why the heck should you trust me?

Great question. Well, for starters, because I'm a parent. But not just a parent, I'm a single parent. In fact, I'm a single dad to an amazing young lady, who's 12 going on 21. She's not disrespectful, but she certainly isn't a pushover either. And she's been that way her entire life. I've raised my daughter alone since she was six, and I will tell you all, there are none more tender and understanding when it's appropriate to be, or more brutally honest when it's appropriate to be. (Even sometimes when it's maybe not so appropriate to be.) Bottom line: She'd never let me get away with anything other than 100% commitment. And she never allows me to look down on myself. Trust me, I'm human, and every single one of us, especially us artists, flirt with self-consciousness from time to time, and we can often be our very own worst critics. With this little one in my life, there's no time for any of that bull. She picks me up the moment I start slipping. And, in reality, I just know better now. It's not all or nothing, it's ""Everything; absolutely and uncompromisingly so!""This film is just as much for the audience, as it is for her, and for all the families of every single member of our team, which in itself is a creative family. I would be most honored if you could be a part of that family. I ask you with the greatest humility: Please help us spread the word from sidewalk to rooftop. Please, help us and join Team Contrived!!!With the warmest regards, Angel Rosa Writer, Producer, Director, Contrived",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<h3><i>Beat of the drums unite Africa and First Nations</i></h3>
<p>My name is Valerie Hill, founder and executive director of the non-profit, Dream for Uganda. Our mandate is to support Cambridge Secondary School, located in the slums of Kampala, in a place so raw and disrupted, most Westerners cringe. But at the heart of this school is a remarkable group of performing arts student, Suubi Fusion Troupe, the subject of Dream for Uganda's first documentary: Suubi: Dance, Drum, Dream. The film was screened in Nov. 2015 at the opening gala of the Grand River Film Festival, to a sold out house in Cambridge, Ontario.</p>
<p>The success of that film led to the filmmakers asking ""do you have any other ideas?""</p>
<p>You bet we did and so the idea for <strong><i>Two Drums, Many Dreamers </i></strong>was born.</p>
<p><i><strong>The Project: </strong></i>In March 2017, three filmmakers, crew and eight members of the First Nations performance troupe, White Pine Dancers, will travel to Uganda where they will collaborate with Suubi and other Ugandan singers, dancers, drummers and traditional storytellers.</p>
<p>It's important to us that these two groups drive the story, with no outside interference. They will embrace commonalities and share differences with mutual respect.</p>
<p>This story has never been told before. Imagine being part of it? Imagine being at the film screening and meeting Suubi and the White Pine Dancers? Imagine having your name on the film as a supporter. Without you, this stunning film might not happen.</p>
<p>We have support from Ugandan Tourism which will help with the air and ground transportation, but there are all the production and post productions costs and that is where we need your help.</p>
<p>As part of our funding team YOU will have your name attached to the project. We have even included one big perk: an adventure in Uganda, with a personal safari guide, three nights in a national park and a private performance by Suubi  plus your own copy of the film.</p>
<p>The funds raised will be part of our overall project budget of $200,000. Everyone has been busy applying for government grants, private foundation funding and anything else we can think of, but we really need YOU.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In an age when our First Nations are finally being recognized for all they have suffered at the hands of colonizers, from being driven off their lands to being forced into residential schools, this film will show a side of their culture few get to experience. It is a celebration and exploration of all that makes the First Nations a justifiably proud and remarkable people.</p>
<p>Juno award winning Inuk singer, <i>Susan Aglukark</i> believes in this project and has agreed to narrate the film.</p>
<p><i><i>World class photographer</i>, Sherry Prenevost</i>, believes in the project. She will be shooting stills as well as video. Her photos are part of collections around the world including Queen Elizabeth's and David Suzuki's, among other high profile dignitaries.</p>
<p><i>Michael Summers</i>, a full member of the Oneida Nations of the Thames, believes in this project. He will be one of the three filmmakers on the project.</p>
<p><i>MetaMedia filmmakers</i>, Paul Francescutti and Paul Campsall, believe in the project despite the uncertain funding. Both are experienced filmmakers who have worked for major charities in Africa and South America.</p>
<p><i>Maise Sum, PhD</i>, asst. music professor at the University of Waterloo, believes in this project and is on board as our academic advisor. Her specialty is music of Morocco and the sub-Saharan diaspora and the impact of global forces on musical traditions and identity,</p>
<p>The <i>Kitchener-Waterloo Symphony</i> believes in this project. The first combined performance of the White Pine Dancers and Suubi Fusion Troupe will be with the symphony in the 2,000 seat performance hall, Centre in the Square, Kitchener.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Past successes and future challenges:</h3>
<p>In less than three years since Dream for Uganda became a registered non-profit we have accomplished more than most organizations do in a decade including installing a 3,500-title library complete with full-time librarian and a modern computer cataloguing system. We also installed a music room and one of our team members has painted just about the whole darned school. We also purchased new equipment and desks, fixed broken concrete floors and replaced old furniture and we've launched a entrepreneur program, providing kids with skills useful beyond high school. There are members of the Dream for Uganda team on the ground working hard at the school on a regular basis. This is our lifelong commitment.</p>
<p> In May 2013, Dream for Uganda brought the first group of 10 Suubi performers to Ontario for a two-week tour.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2015 we brought 14 members of Suubi  (a Luganda word for 'Hope') for their second Canadian tour. The month-long tour coincided with the screening of the documentary film <i>Suubi: Dance, Drum, Dream</i> at the Grand River Film Festival's opening gala at the Dunfield Theatre, Cambridge. It was a sold out house.</p>
<p>Everywhere the film screened, Suubi performed and audiences were emotionally charged, often to the point of tears. </p>
<p>We have faced a few hurdles throughout this experience, including dealing with bureaucrats who took their time processing Suubi's travel visas (we had everything finalized only hours before their flight left for Canada). We also had a private benefactor come forward at the last minute to pay for airfares after or fundraising efforts hadn't been successful.</p>
<p>In this new film, the scope will be bigger and we will have no control over how everything turns out, unlike the Suubi film. There will be no script, no professional actors: we are letting the Ugandans and White Pine Dancers tell the story through their collaboration. It's risky, but we feel it's necessary to give the film authenticity, that rawness that makes for great storytelling.</p>
<p>This is a big project and need you but if you can't help financially, please consider holding fundraisers even if it's just inviting people to your home for a card game or dinner or dessert or all three. Several small fundraisers will add up.</p>
<p>And pass the word on about this campaign, take ownership and be proud that you are part of something that has never been done before, something that could change how the world views First Nations and African music, culture and history.</p>

<p><u><strong>Defender: A Groundbreaking New Film on the Criminal Justice System in America</strong></u></p>
<p>Hi. I'm Jeff Adachi, the writer and producer of two award winning PBS feature documentary films  asking for your help to bring a new project to life: </p>
<p><i>""Defender"" is a feature length film about the critical role that public defenders play in fighting for racial and social justice in America.  The film takes viewers on a personal and intense tour through the underbelly of the criminal injustice system, seen through the eyes of SF Public Defender Jeff Adachi, who is one of the nation’s few elected public defenders.  Adachi tells the story of how public defenders came to be, and why they play a critical role as the watchdogs of a system that over-incarcerates people of color and has long been out of control .  Adachi also exposes the racism within the system.  </i></p>
<p><i>Adachi represents a young African American man who is charged with assaulting police officers after being falsely accused of a crime in a case with racial overtones. In this era of mass incarceration and police shootings of young African American men, how do we, as a society, grapple with the issues of racism and implicit bias in policing and its consequences for those who question police authority?  The film also follows Adachi's public battle to allow his office to represent immigrants in deportation proceedings in post-Trump America.</i></p>

</div></div>","Defender: A Groundbreaking New Film on the Criminal Justice System in America
Hi. I'm Jeff Adachi, the writer and producer of two award winning PBS feature documentary films  asking for your help to bring a new project to life: 
""Defender"" is a feature length film about the critical role that public defenders play in fighting for racial and social justice in America.  The film takes viewers on a personal and intense tour through the underbelly of the criminal injustice system, seen through the eyes of SF Public Defender Jeff Adachi, who is one of the nation’s few elected public defenders.  Adachi tells the story of how public defenders came to be, and why they play a critical role as the watchdogs of a system that over-incarcerates people of color and has long been out of control .  Adachi also exposes the racism within the system.  
Adachi represents a young African American man who is charged with assaulting police officers after being falsely accused of a crime in a case with racial overtones. In this era of mass incarceration and police shootings of young African American men, how do we, as a society, grapple with the issues of racism and implicit bias in policing and its consequences for those who question police authority?  The film also follows Adachi's public battle to allow his office to represent immigrants in deportation proceedings in post-Trump America.
The film is co-directed by Jim Choi, who has made several award winning films including ""Chasing Seasons"" and ""The People's Hospital,"" and edited by Chihiro Wimbush (""Dogtown Redemption"").

</div></div>","NEW PERK!!! New perk at the $500 level where you get to choose an item that goes into the film. This can include a branded shirt, mug, hat, anything else you can think of! Talk about brand exposure! It could also be a random item that you own that you want to see in the movie (within reason of course). Let's do it!

Extended Director's Cut of the Campaign Video


 

 


 
The Promise follows the newly engaged Carl and Jillian as they embark on a romantic picnic in the wilderness. When the couple is kidnapped, perspective becomes everything. 
 
The Promise is an intense, dark comedy/thriller that is inspired by true events. We love combining comedy with other genres to make the audience feel the urge to laugh even when they feel scared, nervous or tense. This film will have you on the edge of your seat, laughing, and then immediately back on the edge of your seat. 
We are going to be running a very fun and interactive campaign because we want YOU to be part of our team. We will be running contests, promotions and even give you the chance to vote on key decisions throughout the various perk levels. These include casting decisions, choosing the mask of the kidnappers, and many more. We'll be adding new perks and contests throughout the campaign so be sure to check back. 
 

Tunnel Light Pictures is a new film production company based out of Los Angeles, CA focused on making bold and daring cross-genre feature films. 
Hollywood is filled with production companies, both big and small, producing very similar content with large teams and even larger budgets. We are doing things differently. There are a lot of voices in this town but not enough willing to stand out and be weird. That's where we come in.
 


Tyler Cole co-founded Tunnel Light Pictures two years ago and has since directed several short films, music videos and commercials. The Promise will be Tyler's feature film directorial debut. 
 


Aaron Burt has starred in five feature films and has been studying acting in LA for 15 years at The American Academy of Dramatic Arts and Brad Henke Studio. Aaron also co-founded Tunnel Light Pictures 2 years ago.
 


Tina Carbone is credited as a producer on over 20 short films, three of which (Fragile Storm, Comrade Crunch, and Killer Friends) have showcased at numerous festivals and won multiple awards. ""Killer Friends"" is also an Oscar qualifying film this year. 
 


Jarrod Burt has been editing feature films and post-producing at Bunim/Murray for 12 years. His credits include ""Keeping up with the Kardashians"", ""Real World Challenge"", and ""Born This Way"" for which his work has won him an Emmy.
 


E.K. Wimmer is an artist and musician. Under the name Veduta, he released two L.P.s, three E.P.s and was included on six compilations. Under his own name, he has released two solo records.
Wimmer has also scored several short films including ""Philophobia"" and ""The Uber of Killing"" for Tunnel Light Pictures. His first feature, ""In the Company of Strangers"", premiered in Los Angeles, CA on March 11, 2015.

<h3>What's the scenario?<br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p>3, places an in-depth focus on Polyamorous Relationships and
how it directly and indirectly affects all traditional and nontraditional
relationships anywhere near it. </p>
<p>Caleb “Cal” Gore, Maya Fields, and Brittany Kendall are in a
3 person polyamorous relationship. They live together and there’s never a dull
moment. Their relationship is the talk of the town, good and bad. </p>
<p>Caleb’s good friend, Andrew “Drew” Sparks is in a
dysfunctional relationship with Maya’s best friend, April May Gilliam. April
and Andrew are coasting along, doing all the wrong things at the right time.

What's the scenario?
 
3, places an in-depth focus on Polyamorous Relationships and
how it directly and indirectly affects all traditional and nontraditional
relationships anywhere near it. 
Caleb “Cal” Gore, Maya Fields, and Brittany Kendall are in a
3 person polyamorous relationship. They live together and there’s never a dull
moment. Their relationship is the talk of the town, good and bad. 
Caleb’s good friend, Andrew “Drew” Sparks is in a
dysfunctional relationship with Maya’s best friend, April May Gilliam. April
and Andrew are coasting along, doing all the wrong things at the right time.
They’d be an amazing couple if they could just get out of their own way.
The wildcard of the crew is Phillip Ward. He’s single, and
unprepared to mingle. For years, he stood by Cal’s side and told him lie after
lie about his sexual prowess. Phil finally admits it to Cal and becomes his
protégé.

<h3>'The Story of Airlander' Documentary series</h3>
<p><i>'The Story of Airlander' is a three year documentary project, telling the</i><i> </i><i>incredible story of the Airlander hybrid airship.<br/><br/><b>PLEASE NOTE: All presales have now transferred to </b><a href=""http://deanarnett.com/index3/?page_id=1331"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.airlander.deanarnett.com</a></i></p>
<p>UPDATE (APRIL 2017) - Now Airlander 10 is back out of the shed, we expect delivery of all discs to be in Sept / Oct 2017. Many thanks again for all your patience but we felt it importnat to capture the whole story.</p>
<p><br/>Airships have captivated the public for decades. These majestic, giant ships, that 'hang' in the air, seem to defy physics. They are the graceful, silent, creation of big dreamers. They are the symbols of big dreams. They are the epitome of man's deep rooted desire to create machines many times bigger than themselves that tame nature.<br/><br/>Hybrid Air Vehicles have spent years developing the airship idea, taking it to the next level by creating not only the world's largest Hybrid Aircraft, but the world's largest flying aircraft, Airlander!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463217379/Final_Shot_04_Edit_ncigop.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>Several other companies around the world are developing giant airships for a number of roles;<br/>- airships that carry cargo,<br/>- airships that provide low cost communications,<br/>- airships carrying security surveillance equipment<br/>- and airships that provide an environmentally friendly alternative to conventional aircraft.<br/><br/>But the giant Airlander airship, has got there first.<br/> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461620456/story_2_zee0d9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>However, the Airlander, built by Hybrid Air Vehicles at the famous old Cardington airship hangars (where the R101 airship was built), has not had an easy journey. In its original form, as a surveillance ship for the US Army, budget cuts meant she was soon cancelled, scrapped and cut up. Against all the odds, she was saved and what came next can only be descibed as an inspirational story of incredible achievement. It's a story of a small group of men battling against the odds, taking on some of the biggest companies in the world by realising the dream of the original designer, who died just two months before their first order.<br/><br/><i>With unique, behind the scenes access from the last two and a half years (already filmed), leading up to and including the first flight, this amazing story can be told for the first time.</i><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461620501/story_3_drnygm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What this campaign will fund</h3>
<p>This funding will unlock nearly three years of unfunded filming behind the scenes, following the story of Airlander. With official, unique, behind the scenes access to design and building work, technical, strategic, financial and managment challenges and meetings - this is a story like no other.<br/><br/>Ultimately your contribution will pay for the post production process of the mini series, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Editing costs</li>
<li>Music costs</li>
<li>Archive costs</li>
<li>Computer animation costs</li>
<li>Sound mixing and picture grading costs</li>
<li>DVD and Blu-Ray mastering costs</li>
<li>Completion costs to produce a broadcast master for possible transmission on a major global broadcaster</li>
</ul>

'The Story of Airlander' is a three year documentary project, telling the incredible story of the Airlander hybrid airship.PLEASE NOTE: All presales have now transferred to www.airlander.deanarnett.com
UPDATE (APRIL 2017) - Now Airlander 10 is back out of the shed, we expect delivery of all discs to be in Sept / Oct 2017. Many thanks again for all your patience but we felt it importnat to capture the whole story.
Airships have captivated the public for decades. These majestic, giant ships, that 'hang' in the air, seem to defy physics. They are the graceful, silent, creation of big dreamers. They are the symbols of big dreams. They are the epitome of man's deep rooted desire to create machines many times bigger than themselves that tame nature.Hybrid Air Vehicles have spent years developing the airship idea, taking it to the next level by creating not only the world's largest Hybrid Aircraft, but the world's largest flying aircraft, Airlander!

Several other companies around the world are developing giant airships for a number of roles;- airships that carry cargo,- airships that provide low cost communications,- airships carrying security surveillance equipment- and airships that provide an environmentally friendly alternative to conventional aircraft.But the giant Airlander airship, has got there first. 
However, the Airlander, built by Hybrid Air Vehicles at the famous old Cardington airship hangars (where the R101 airship was built), has not had an easy journey. In its original form, as a surveillance ship for the US Army, budget cuts meant she was soon cancelled, scrapped and cut up. Against all the odds, she was saved and what came next can only be descibed as an inspirational story of incredible achievement. It's a story of a small group of men battling against the odds, taking on some of the biggest companies in the world by realising the dream of the original designer, who died just two months before their first order.With unique, behind the scenes access from the last two and a half years (already filmed), leading up to and including the first flight, this amazing story can be told for the first time.
 

What this campaign will fund
This funding will unlock nearly three years of unfunded filming behind the scenes, following the story of Airlander. With official, unique, behind the scenes access to design and building work, technical, strategic, financial and managment challenges and meetings - this is a story like no other.Ultimately your contribution will pay for the post production process of the mini series, including:

Editing costs
Music costs
Archive costs
Computer animation costs
Sound mixing and picture grading costs
DVD and Blu-Ray mastering costs
Completion costs to produce a broadcast master for possible transmission on a major global broadcaster

 
 

Who is making it?Internationally award winning documentary filmmaker, Dean Arnett is making 'The Story of Airlander', along with two other major airship documentaries (not part of this campaign but coming out later in 2016) through the production company, Dean Media Ltd.Dean has been in the industry for nearly thirty years and now splits his time between documentary making and delivering training on production and filmmaking for major broadcasters around the world such as the BBC.You can find out more about Dean and the background of 'The Story of Airlander' at his website - www.airlander.deanarnett.com

Risks & Challenges
Nearly three years of unfunded filming has taken place so far, so we will make sure this series is completed no matter what.
You WILL see 'The Story of Airlander' in 2016 on your TV!
 
 
 

So what do I get?
 
We want you to be as excited about this story and project as we are. So we want to share as much with you as we possibly can. From regular news updates to credits at the end of films to executive producer status to special edition Blu-Ray discs of the series and limited edition posters, we want to reward your help.The Story of Airlander is an independent production.

dialogue about the heroin and opioid problem. Groups of resilient kids, each drawing on their own inner superhero,
will go a long way toward fighting the heroin epidemic.</p>

<h3>What are MOGU sleeves and how to use them?</h3>MOGU sleeves are very long pieces of <strong>colorful</strong>, soft and light fabric sewn to form sleeves which tie together to be worn. They are really <strong>simple to use</strong> and make the <strong>play free and open</strong>. When you put them on, the whole new world opens up for you to explore! They <strong>simply</strong> <strong>urge the motion</strong>, make you <strong>spin</strong>, make you<strong> run</strong>, and they just <strong>fly</strong> behind you. They make you reach further and enable to touch and connect beyond the expected.<br/> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475007819/_W4A9452_wmcmwi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>MOGU sleeves can become the <strong>wings of a dragon</strong> or a <strong>dress of a princess</strong>, the magic rays of a powerful wizard or a fearsome typhoon. It all depends on you and your imagination. There are <strong>no instructions or guidelines</strong> – so be prepared to be surprised!</p>
<p>They are suitable both <strong>for children and for adults</strong>. Get silly with your kids. Set yourself free!</p>
<p>MOGU sleeves are <strong>easy to pack and carry</strong> with you.</p>
<p>Material used is high quality, soft, lite and very pleasant to the <strong>sense of touch</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476180565/axaprmsqqrdkeud9govs.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Where the inspiration came from?</h3>Inspiration for MOGU sleeves comes from a<strong> form of dance</strong> – the traditional Chinese dancing with long-sleeves. You might have seen it in the “House of Flying Daggers” movie.<br/> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475008089/51_ad897h.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The creator of MOGU sleeves has personally been practicing the <a href=""http://www.5rhythms.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">5 Rhythms dance</a> for years:</p>
<p><i>“5 Rhythms dance has benefited me in many different ways. It liberated me. It helped me find my freedom both in movement and in spirit and made me realize how these two are connected. I started out as someone who was more comfortable staying at the corner of the dance hall. I hardly moved my arms while dancing. But now, I find the Lyrical rhythm, the one of 5 with the emphasis on arms, joy and ease of being, closest to my true nature. <strong>When my movements are wide and when I take A LOT of space, it feels great! </strong>I feel great – and that amazing feeling transfers further to all other aspects of life, and I am truly grateful for it. MOGU sleeves are the manifestation of this energy, this joy of life!”</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475008215/_W4A9863_k2yoxt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why are they valuable?</h3>
<p>MOGU sleeves <strong>set you free!</strong> This simple, yet amazing plaything <strong>inspires movement</strong>. It creates a situation which is different than usual, and the <strong>sense of wonder</strong> is awakened. The <strong>exploration</strong> starts. You can’t be sure what you will find. You need to move and find out. Move your arms, move your feet, move closer to your play-mate, move away, spin, run, jump, wave, stop, chase, ketch, pull, rest, <strong>breathe</strong>, get tangled, untangle, move gracefully, move fast or move slow, even slower... This exploration of movement <strong>ignites the imaginative play</strong>. Move slow as a snail with the sleeve being a slimy trail, or move strongly like a wind! Remember – how does a king move in his robe? A gymnast with a ribbon? A wave in the ocean? A fish with exotic colorful fins? A bird? A lizard?</p>
<p><strong>Physical activity</strong> is very important for healthy development of children and maintaining the health of adults. But if the physical activity is also <strong>fun</strong>, it can be elevated into something more. It can move the entire being by awaking the <strong>sense of wonder, creativity, imagination, emotions, interactions, the freedom itself.</strong></p>

<p>Creating toys and playthings is a passion that people involved in MOGU sleeves share and would love to keep <strong>sharing it with others!</strong> Croudfunding is a great way to reach a greater audience, connect with people, get feedback, and <strong>develop new toys through play</strong>.

<p>Reaching the goal would enable us <strong>to produce a series</strong> of MOGU sleeves for new playmates out there and help the rest of MOGU toys become more than an idea, but a real playmate on a real playground.

<h2>Rewards</h2>
<p>For all rewards you will be able to choose from 5 available colors, and 3 sleeve lengths. Longest sleeves are 2m long (size L) and are suitable for parents as well as for kids above 6 years old. Middle size is 1.6m (size M) and suits kids from 3 to 6 yeas old. The smallest sleeves are 1.2m (size S). MOGU sleeves are not recommended for children under the age of 3 - if you use them you need to be careful so kids do not trip over them, since they will drag on the ground. These recommendations are approximate. You can decide what is best for your kids based on their height. Consider that 40cm goes to tie them and the rest of the length will hang from the shoulder.</p>

</div></div>","What are MOGU sleeves and how to use them?MOGU sleeves are very long pieces of colorful, soft and light fabric sewn to form sleeves which tie together to be worn. They are really simple to use and make the play free and open. When you put them on, the whole new world opens up for you to explore! They simply urge the motion, make you spin, make you run, and they just fly behind you. They make you reach further and enable to touch and connect beyond the expected. 
MOGU sleeves can become the wings of a dragon or a dress of a princess, the magic rays of a powerful wizard or a fearsome typhoon. It all depends on you and your imagination. There are no instructions or guidelines – so be prepared to be surprised!
They are suitable both for children and for adults. Get silly with your kids. Set yourself free!
MOGU sleeves are easy to pack and carry with you.
Material used is high quality, soft, lite and very pleasant to the sense of touch.
 

 
Where the inspiration came from?Inspiration for MOGU sleeves comes from a form of dance – the traditional Chinese dancing with long-sleeves. You might have seen it in the “House of Flying Daggers” movie. 
The creator of MOGU sleeves has personally been practicing the 5 Rhythms dance for years:
“5 Rhythms dance has benefited me in many different ways. It liberated me. It helped me find my freedom both in movement and in spirit and made me realize how these two are connected. I started out as someone who was more comfortable staying at the corner of the dance hall. I hardly moved my arms while dancing. But now, I find the Lyrical rhythm, the one of 5 with the emphasis on arms, joy and ease of being, closest to my true nature. When my movements are wide and when I take A LOT of space, it feels great! I feel great – and that amazing feeling transfers further to all other aspects of life, and I am truly grateful for it. MOGU sleeves are the manifestation of this energy, this joy of life!”
 

 

Why are they valuable?
MOGU sleeves set you free! This simple, yet amazing plaything inspires movement. It creates a situation which is different than usual, and the sense of wonder is awakened. The exploration starts. You can’t be sure what you will find. You need to move and find out. Move your arms, move your feet, move closer to your play-mate, move away, spin, run, jump, wave, stop, chase, ketch, pull, rest, breathe, get tangled, untangle, move gracefully, move fast or move slow, even slower... This exploration of movement ignites the imaginative play. Move slow as a snail with the sleeve being a slimy trail, or move strongly like a wind! Remember – how does a king move in his robe? A gymnast with a ribbon? A wave in the ocean? A fish with exotic colorful fins? A bird? A lizard?
Physical activity is very important for healthy development of children and maintaining the health of adults. But if the physical activity is also fun, it can be elevated into something more. It can move the entire being by awaking the sense of wonder, creativity, imagination, emotions, interactions, the freedom itself.
 

 

Why crowdfunding
Creating toys and playthings is a passion that people involved in MOGU sleeves share and would love to keep sharing it with others! Croudfunding is a great way to reach a greater audience, connect with people, get feedback, and develop new toys through play. The more people play the better.
Reaching the goal would enable us to produce a series of MOGU sleeves for new playmates out there and help the rest of MOGU toys become more than an idea, but a real playmate on a real playground. That means being able to buy materials, hire 2 people to help us sew, organize marketing and start selling!

My experience with this story began at St. Elizabeth Elementary School in Bronzeville on the south side of Chicago three decades ago when a theatre company performed a stage play of the story for the students. I am an alumnus and former 5th Grade teacher at St. Elizabeth School, so my history with this educational institution runs deep. Unfortunately, today the doors of the school are closed, but the church still stands as a beacon light of hope in the Bronzeville community. My journey as a storyteller and filmmaker began at St. ""E."" Although the school wasn't operating, I felt that somehow it wasn't done with me yet. </p><p>As I began the search for one of the critical locations for “Pale Blue Eye,” St. Elizabeth immediately came to mind.  I called the church office and set a meeting with the board of trustees. We discussed my plans for the film and their plans to possibly reopen in the future. Later, they unanimously voted for us to shoot our film in the basement of the former church building. The old church was where I experienced ""Tell-Tale Heart"" for the first time. So, it felt surreal to return to my old stomping ground with the cast and crew of my new movie inspired by ""Tell-Tale Heart."" The church's basement turned out to be the perfect location. It was a massive unfinished space and had the eerie look we needed to help compellingly tell the story. </p><p>So, what is this movie about? I can better answer that question by explaining what my movie is not about. “Pale Blue Eye” is not a regurgitation of “Tell-Tale Heart.” Many filmmakers have taken the literal approach when adapting this narrative. However, I wanted to do something different. My mission became retelling the story in a familiar but different way while adding a twist of diversity.</p><p>The logline for my film is as follows: ""Pale Blue Eye"" by Keith A. Nixon is the story of a black woman named Norma Redmond, who is a schizophrenic surgical assistant for a crooked doctor who becomes haunted by the sound of her employer’s heartbeat after she murders him.</p><p>During our previous campaign for “Pale Blue Eye,” we raised over 3,000 dollars in 13 days to shoot our movie. We began principal photography on July 17th, 2017 at 5 AM and we wrapped production on July 21st, 2017 at 11:57 PM. This amounted to an intense five-day shooting schedule. The cosmetic conditions of the space made it a tough shoot, (lots of dust, limited electrical power, no working restrooms on site). We worked well as a team under pressure and found solutions to the problems that challenged us.  The result of our sacrifice and hard work was capturing beautiful footage that made it all worth the extra effort.</p><p>Now that production is complete we are ready to move the film forward into the Post-Production process. Our post-production process is broken down into two parts: Assembly and Finishing.</p><p>During the assembly phase, our editors work on building the film, piecing together all the shots, scenes, sequences, and sound bites until the picture is locked and ready for the second step, finishing.</p><p>When we enter the finishing phase, we will deliver the editor's assembly of the film to Periscope Post &amp; Sound, one of the leading post-production houses in Chicago, IL. They have completed post-production on feature films, documentaries, commercials, and network television shows. The experts at Periscope will help take ""Pale Blue Eye"" to the next level by refining the assembly edits, professional color grading, and the final mix of sound &amp; music.

<p><strong>Dave Heeley has decided that he wants to follow in the footsteps of renowned explorer and adventurer Sir Ranulph Fiennes and complete one of the toughest marathons in the world, the “Sevens” -  seven marathons on seven continents in seven days. The only problem is that Dave is completely blind.</strong></p>
<p>Through the use of flashbacks, 7 DAYS will tell the incredible story of how after being diagnosed at the age of ten with a condition that would eventually rob him of his sight, Dave would go on to become an inspiration to thousands all around the world.</p>
<p>As filmmakers, we are drawn to true stories that are both inspiring and incredible. Not only is Dave’s story one of the most amazing stories of overcoming adversity that we have come across, he also happens to be from the Midlands and as a Midland based filmmakers ourselves, it’s great to be making a film about a local hero!</p>
<p>However, we do believe that Dave shouldn't be just a local hero, but one that is better known around the world and it's our aim to make that happen. We truly believe that this film will have the power to inspire others who are facing disadvantages in life to pursue their dreams and never give up.</p>
<p>The film is already gathering a lot of interest, and on our last shoot (in January), we had  BBC Midlands visiting our set! Check out their piece on the film below!</p>

<p>We have already managed to secure enough funding to push the film through development and into production - but to enable us to create the film that we envisage, we still need to raise more money in order to cover the costs of recreating certain locations, hiring costumes and props, and of course, paying our hard working crew and cast.</p>
<p>It's a cliche, but every penny really will help us to make this film. Be a part of our journey as we make this film a reality!</p>

</div></div>","Synopsis

Dave Heeley has decided that he wants to follow in the footsteps of renowned explorer and adventurer Sir Ranulph Fiennes and complete one of the toughest marathons in the world, the “Sevens” -  seven marathons on seven continents in seven days. The only problem is that Dave is completely blind.
Through the use of flashbacks, 7 DAYS will tell the incredible story of how after being diagnosed at the age of ten with a condition that would eventually rob him of his sight, Dave would go on to become an inspiration to thousands all around the world.
As filmmakers, we are drawn to true stories that are both inspiring and incredible. Not only is Dave’s story one of the most amazing stories of overcoming adversity that we have come across, he also happens to be from the Midlands and as a Midland based filmmakers ourselves, it’s great to be making a film about a local hero!
However, we do believe that Dave shouldn't be just a local hero, but one that is better known around the world and it's our aim to make that happen. We truly believe that this film will have the power to inspire others who are facing disadvantages in life to pursue their dreams and never give up.
The film is already gathering a lot of interest, and on our last shoot (in January), we had  BBC Midlands visiting our set! Check out their piece on the film below!


 

We have already managed to secure enough funding to push the film through development and into production - but to enable us to create the film that we envisage, we still need to raise more money in order to cover the costs of recreating certain locations, hiring costumes and props, and of course, paying our hard working crew and cast.
It's a cliche, but every penny really will help us to make this film. Be a part of our journey as we make this film a reality!


 

 

The word is already getting out!



“The West Bromwich Albion Football club and the Albion Foundation is absolutely delighted that a film is being made about Dave”.

The Impact
In his book, FROM LIGHT TO DARK, Dave mentions a moment just after completing the “Sevens”, when he overheard a blind boy in the crowd saying to his friend, “If he can do this, what can I do?” This sums up exactly the reason we want to make this film.
Dave’s story is incredibly inspiring and with your help, our film can take Dave’s story to an even wider audience. No other medium has the emotional power of film to inspire and make a difference.
You'll also be helping a new generation of film-makers. As mentioned above, we will be working in partnership with Birmingham South and City College to ensure their film students get the valuable experience they need when starting out in this competitive industry. 

Risks & Challenges

Of course, every film is a challenge, especially one that is set in seven different countries and includes scenes set in the 1960s and 1970s. But challenges are something we thrive on as a team.
Our most recent feature film, All That Remains was filmed in Birmingham and set in 1940’s Japan. By employing green-screen technology and CGI we were able to convince a Japanese audience that it was filmed on location in Japan.
As George Lucas once said, the secret to film is that it’s an illusion and a quick look at our previous work will show you that we’ve become pretty adept at the art of illusion.

<p>Hello! My name is Jenny. I am an actor in Los Angeles, CA and need your help, so please continue reading :)  I am currently putting together a new acting demo reel. A demo reel is a video collaboration of your past acting roles to show your type/talent. However, most of my past roles are from short films/student films and don't provide me with enough footage or good quality footage. SO instead ofjust waiting to be cast in roles, hoping the footage is usable and spending years trying to collect enough good quality clips of my material for a reel, I've decided I'll just write the roles myself. Because in this industry if you're not CREATING, than you're just WAITING.The acting reel I currently have is 99% from a webseries I co-wrote and funded myself last year. (You can watch that at the end of the video on this page.) However it is not nearly enough footage for a reel, so I am currently working on filming a few NEW scenes to add. Even with help from my family, I am short on budget. I've hired a crew that consists of sound, lighting, camera and director, and have reached my maximum amount of spending. BUT I STILL NEED A LOCATION TO FILM! What good is a crew and a script, if you have no where to make the magic happen! In order to make these scenes the best quality possible, I plan on filming at a sound stage with actual sets. I've spent hours researching places and now I need your help! This reel could really help advance my career and I'd love any amount you could help out with!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>I'm a senior in the film and television program at NYU Tisch. I've written and directed a number of short films. I've also interned at Red Hour Films and Penguin Random House.</li>
<li>This poetic, loosely narrative short film aims to explore humanity's relationship with nature, and our responsibility to the Earth. While this film is about the end of the world, it is ultimately full of hope and appreciation for our planet. </li>
<li>Your support and contributions are vital to this production, and will mean so much to the entire team behind this film.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need $3,800 in total to make this film. We've been awarded an allotment of $800 from NYU. The remaining $3,000 in donations will go towards crucial aspects of production, including location, transportation, food, equipment rentals and production design.</li>
<li>Contributors will receive exclusive merchandise, credit in the film, and more!</li>
<li>Since this film focuses so heavily on nature and the environment, location is the priority! So, if we don't reach our entire goal, funds will be allocated to location first.</li>
</ul>

</div></div>","Short Summary

I'm a senior in the film and television program at NYU Tisch. I've written and directed a number of short films. I've also interned at Red Hour Films and Penguin Random House.
This poetic, loosely narrative short film aims to explore humanity's relationship with nature, and our responsibility to the Earth. While this film is about the end of the world, it is ultimately full of hope and appreciation for our planet. 
Your support and contributions are vital to this production, and will mean so much to the entire team behind this film.


What We Need & What You Get

We need $3,800 in total to make this film. We've been awarded an allotment of $800 from NYU. The remaining $3,000 in donations will go towards crucial aspects of production, including location, transportation, food, equipment rentals and production design.
Contributors will receive exclusive merchandise, credit in the film, and more!
Since this film focuses so heavily on nature and the environment, location is the priority! So, if we don't reach our entire goal, funds will be allocated to location first.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Story</h3>
<p>Drag queens. Hit men. Drug deals. Romance. We’re not talking about the newest season of NCIS: New Orleans, but a new short film out of Boston University’s film production program: <i>Honey and Jerome Forever!</i></p>
<p>Borne from a love for the campy works of John Waters, the melodrama of classic “bad movies” like <i>Showgirls</i>, and the artistry of drag, writer and director Annalise Lamberty began writing <i>Honey and Jerome Forever!</i> almost a year ago in an attempt to bring some color to the average student film repertoire. Centering around Honey Velvet, a young drag queen, and her boyfriend Jerome, this film asks the audience: how do you pick between love and livelihood?<br/><br/>With cult cinema subject matter and super stylized visuals, the <i>Honey and Jerome Forever!</i> team hopes to create a film that can only be described as “meaningfully campy” - fun and over-the-top, but still impactful and politically significant. We believe that a step towards equal representation of people of color and the LGBT community in film and TV starts with us, a diverse cast and crew, telling a fun story that everyone can get into.</p>

<p><strong>Set Dressing/Makeup and Wardrobe:</strong> These two categories make up almost half of our budget because they're important to creating a believable, lived-in world.

<p><strong>Locations:</strong> Because we wanted to have as much control as possible over the setting we're shooting in, we're shooting in a studio space and building our set from the ground-up. This section of our budget is dedicated to the rental costs for the studio we'll be filming in.</p>
<p><strong>Food/On-Set Costs:</strong> With an estimated 6 days of shooting, we need to keep our cast and crew fed (and thus, happy).

Everyone who donates will benefit from different perks to say ""Thank You!"" for supporting the project from the beginning.
If we don't make the goal of $5,000, the project will still go on with a few cut corners to make up for the difference. Every size donation helps a ton and is appreciated by the whole crew.

Wanting to make sure everyone in the crew and cast are taken care of and that any supplies that would be needed to make a smoother workflow are available to the production. 

Everyone who donates will be included in the credits of the film under ""Special Thanks"" with your full name.
Since 2014, I have made one film each year with increasing skill in each new film, applying what I have learned in film school, leading all the way up to my biggest project yet, this one!

<p>Autumn Leaves born in <i>August 2016</i>  by a Gian Marco Castro and Ludovica Ingallina's idea.</p>
<p>The project includes a short film's production where the theme is death caused by cancer. We chose this sensitive theme because in Sicily, expecially in Augusta, Priolo and Melilli (<i>Triangle of death</i>), every year there is a high rate of mortality caused by industries.</p>

<p>You will ever happen when you finish to see a film that you start to think how the actors, director, screenplay and costumers were amazing... And what about the <i>Soundtrack</i>? That's what usually happen in many film.</p>
<p>They have a lot of potential, but they're poorly in the music. We are taking care of every single particular of our short film. We decide to start from the soundtrack because one of the most important things for us is the impact of the music in the scenes.</p>
<p> The scenes and the music are strongly connected to each other in this movie. The music will be the background to the scenes, it will be sweet and melancholic accompaniment which will make the emotional scenes unforgettable in the eyes of those who look.</p>

<p>Official Poster of<i> Autumn Leaves </i></p>
</div></div>","Autumn Leaves born in August 2016  by a Gian Marco Castro and Ludovica Ingallina's idea.
The project includes a short film's production where the theme is death caused by cancer. We chose this sensitive theme because in Sicily, expecially in Augusta, Priolo and Melilli (Triangle of death), every year there is a high rate of mortality caused by industries.
 

 

You will ever happen when you finish to see a film that you start to think how the actors, director, screenplay and costumers were amazing... And what about the Soundtrack? That's what usually happen in many film.
They have a lot of potential, but they're poorly in the music. We are taking care of every single particular of our short film. We decide to start from the soundtrack because one of the most important things for us is the impact of the music in the scenes.
 The scenes and the music are strongly connected to each other in this movie. The music will be the background to the scenes, it will be sweet and melancholic accompaniment which will make the emotional scenes unforgettable in the eyes of those who look.
Another particularity of our short film is that is mute, what means mute? Without word and dialogs between the characters. We will take attention in the gesture and the expression of the look.
-We decide to create a mute short film too because we would like to break down the barriers between the languages, in this way the short film will be understandable for everyone-.

First sheet music page

 
Autumn Leaves is a story about love, life and pain.
It's inspired by real events, the story recalls, in a short time, some important phases of main characters's life: a man and woman with her baby, they are dragged inside a vortex of memories unleashing some important moments in them, these moments will understand them the life's deep religious sense.
 

 

 
Autumn Leaves is the english translation of ""Foglie d'autunno"".
The autumn in this story is a symbolic figure, it represents the season where everything dies but at the same time it represent the grape harvest's season but despite decadence that happens, autumn represents something of positive.

A man, after killing his wife, experiences a dilemma: what to do of the seven-year-old son knocking at the door of his study?
DOVE SI VA DA QUI racconta come la famiglia, nucleo di unione, crescita e formazione, diventa uno spazio di dolore e fallimento. Un uomo, dopo aver ucciso la moglie, vive un dilemma: che fare del figlio di sette anni che bussa alla porta del suo studio?
 WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE is a short film that develops the drama of male violence against women and children, focusing on the violent man's story. The script deepens newspaper crimes tragedies. I’ve asked myself: “what was it like when they were happy? How did they feel before they behave in so extreme and violent way? How did they face the eyes of those who once loved them?” WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE comes from the purpose to tell if something healthy and positive remains in family relationships, when anger and loneliness have prevailed.DOVE SI VA DA QUI è un cortometraggio che si sviluppa intorno al dramma della violenza maschile sulle donne e sui bambini, con la peculiarità di mettere al centro della storia l'uomo violento. Il soggetto approfondisce le tragedie che riempiono la cronaca nera dei quotidiani. Mi sono chiesto: “com’era la vita di queste persone quando erano felici? Come si sono sentite prime di commettere gesti così estremi e violenti? Come hanno affrontato lo sguardo di chi un tempo li amava?”.  DOVE SI VA DA QUI nasce dal desiderio di indagare se rimane qualcosa di sano e positivo nelle relazioni familiari, quando rabbia e solitudine hanno avuto il sopravvento.WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE allows me to bring to the screen ordinary people dark side, a path started with Il Gatto del Maine, best short film at Roma International Film Festival in 2012. If in the previously short film I tried to explore “the banality of evil” with negative and avoid of any ethical conflict characters, in WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE the main character is haunted by a deep inner conflict, a family man who becomes executioner. The stylistic choices will be focused on keep the audience both in and out of the characters because what happens is so intimate and complicate that you can’t explain it all the way. While I was writing the script, I tailed the two characters to imagine what could go through their own heart and head, to deeply understand while this story has to be told.Con DOVE SI VA DA QUI proseguo il percorso iniziato con Il Gatto del Maine, miglior cortometraggio al Festival Internazionale del Film di Roma nel 2012, ovvero portare sullo schermo il lato oscuro delle persone “comuni”. Se nel corto precedente ho tentato di esplorare “la banalità del male” con personaggi negativi e privi di qualunque conflitto etico, il protagonista di DOVE SI VA DA QUI è al contrario tormentato da un profondo conflitto interiore, poichè da padre di famiglia diventa carnefice. Le scelte stilistiche avranno l'obiettivo di tenere lo spettatore in bilico nei confronti dei personaggi lasciandolo al tempo stesso dentro e fuori da essi: ciò che accade dentro di loro è così intimo e complesso da non poter essere spiegato. Nello scrivere la sceneggiatura ho immaginato di pedinare i due protagonisti per cercare di capire cosa possa passar loro nel cuore e nella testa, per comprendere a fondo perché questa storia debba essere raccontata. WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE will develop two different points of view: father-son emotional relationship on the one hand and the killer and his potential victim affair on the other. The fatal and social nature of the storytelling will develop also a tension aspect: will the child be able to save himself? Will the father find the clarity to understand his insane direction?DOVE SI VA DA QUI porterà lo spettatore ad assumere un doppio punto di vista narrativo: da una parte l’emotiva relazione padre-figlio, dall’altra la vicenda di un assassino e della sua potenziale vittima. La natura tragica e sociale della narrazione svilupperà anche una dimensione tensiva: riuscirà il bambino a salvarsi? Ritroverà il padre la lucidità per comprendere il folle percorso che ha intrapreso?It wasn’t easy to find an experienced and talented actor for a so delicate and risky role: Peppino Mazzotta was chosen for his ability to play with personality and experience the murder father role, an ordinary face man full of nuances and contradictions. Peppino Mazzotta - movie, theater and tv actor - has shown ease and versatility playing  naturally both positive and comforting role like Inspector Fazio once in Il Commissario Montalbano (an talian famous tv series for Rai Uno), both controversial and murky criminal with respectable face role like the main character of Anime Nere by Francesco Munzi (2014), winner of 9 Donatello David and 3 Silver Ribbon award.Non è stato semplice trovare un attore esperto e di talento per un ruolo così delicato e rischioso: Peppino Mazzotta è stato scelto per la capacità di interpretare con personalità ed equilibrio il ruolo del padre assassino, un uomo dal volto comune ricco di sfumature e contraddizioni. Attore cinematografico, teatrale e televisivo, Peppino Mazzotta ha mostrato negli ultimi anni grande versatilità nell'interpretare sia ruoli positivi come quello dell’ispettore Fazio nella serie tv Il Commissario Montalbano (Rai Uno), sia ruoli controversi e oscuri come quello del criminale con la faccia perbene, protagonista del film Anime Nere di Francesco Munzi (2014), vincitore di 9 David di Donatello e 3 Nastri d’Argento. The young co-star was chosen after we've met many kids. Even if he’s only 8 years old, Riccardo shown great professionalism and talent, he immersed himself in an emotional condition able to return the character’s fragility. After several experiences in commercials (including Mulino Bianco one's with Antonio Banderas) for the first time he contends with a dramatic role in a film.Il piccolo coprotagonista è stato scelto dopo aver incontrato numerosi bambini. Nonostante abbia solo 8 anni, Riccardo ha dimostrato grande professionalità e attitudine nel calarsi in una condizione emotiva capace di restituire la fragilità del personaggio. Dopo varie esperienze in pubblicità (tra cui Mulino Bianco con Antonio Banderas) si misura per la prima volta con un ruolo cinematografico e drammatico.The production company Oki Doki Film was immediately interested in WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE screenplay. We chosen together cast and crew, we shot a teaser video and we launched a Facebook page where you can be updated on project development. The film production and distribution company ZEN MOVIE has become partner of the project, as co-producer of the short film, for the distribution of WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE in the national and international festival circuit. We’ve also started a partnership with some important organizations that daily work to help violent men and theirs victims, like NoiNo.org community and LVD Centre (free ourselves from violence)and the ARES Centre.La casa di produzione Oki Doki Film fin da subito ha dimostrato interesse per la sceneggiatura di DOVE SI VA DA QUI.

Please become a part of our effort. Why We Feel Our Project is Important""Our people have been misunderstood for centuries. The word “Indian” symbolizes a lot of our nation’s history. Even today many Americans assume our culture comprises one unified group of people. But Native Americans were and will always be a nation of many tribes with different traditions, different alliances and different beliefs. Our way of life and the way of our ancestors has attracted the minds of the masses because balance, love and an understanding for the Earth are what we all must share in this modern day and age.""""The history of our people before the early times may not have been written. But the stories passed on from generation to generation will always paint a picture of what life was like.""""Hollywood has made billions exploiting and lying about our people. But today we the people have the ability to rise above to tell our own stories. Narrative films have the ability to create jobs in a way that no documentary film can. Movies are the storytelling medium of the modern age. With entertainment, viewers can experience the past in a way that’s truthful to the time. This story is a work of fiction, but all depictions are historically correct.""""Help us promote the history and culture of Native Americans by supporting us and talented crew of local artists. With your donations, we may have a chance to produce a film that will educate, entertain, employ and inspire.""Thank You... (Gene) Our IncentivesAs tokens of our appreciation we present our backers with genuine Native American handmade creations and varies digital assets from our production. Please keep in mind, that all hand made creations are one of a kind and take time.

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>ABOUT THE TEAM: </u></strong></p>
<p>My name is Jayde Williams and I am here to help tell just one story of someone's struggle. Someone's struggle with their addiction to alcohol, their relationship falling apart and becoming less confident each day in their work and career.  I am passionate about helping people - bringing them up, reassuring them that no matter what is going on in their life, it can be overcome. </p>
<p>I am not the only one here to tell the story though, I have an amazing team that works right beside me bringing this story to life. Dan Felska, our Producer, gives tireless efforts day and night on promoting this film, bringing new, fresh ideas to each meeting we have and... also keeping the teams' ass in line.  Our Editor, Melvin Deer, has been studying non-linear editing for the past two years, is Avid certified and won the best editor award at the Scottsdale Community College film festival last year. He is ready to bring his skills yet again this year with adding his unique visions and flow of the film together in his edit. Kyle Larson and Nina Nandin, our Art Director and Production Designer, are the best pair to have on your side. Joined at the hip since high school these two have clear visions and true artist eyes. They know exactly how to bring a set to life and will be giving each character in Central Office, their own unique touch. James Fatica, our Director of Photography, knows how to really work those camera angles ;) Studying Cinematography for the past few years and will be shooting this picture on the one and only, Red.  Together, this team will bring Central Office to life! </p>
<p><u><strong>ABOUT THE MAIN CHARACTER:</strong></u></p>
<p>William Benson is an independent contractor who installs equipment for what is called a Central Office. A Central Office is a building that operates all business and home phone lines. Will's line of work is dying due to new technology, his alcoholism is causing his pregnant wife to re-think being with him and all the while he has no clue that he will end up being one person's only chance of survival. What would you do if your job meant overhearing a conversation you weren't supposed to? </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>OUR GOAL AND IMPACT:</u></strong></p>
<p>Our goal for this is to not only bring an inspiring film to Arizona, but to hopefully help anyone going through the same problem's as Will. Knowing that you are not alone in what you are going through is important, and by contributing to this film, you are helping show that anyone can get through his or her hardships as well. Together, we can inspire someone to make a different choice in THEIR life through this film. If we've helped just one person in the world to make the choice of overcoming their alcohol addiction, or to repair a broken relationship, or finally sign up for that class that jump starts their career... then we've achieved our goal. </p>

<p>If you are unable to contribute toward the funding, but are still passionate about one of the subjects the film touches, you can help us in many other ways. Simply spread the word! Tell us YOUR story. We would love to hear from you about what you or a loved one are going through and how a film helped inspire you to make a different choice in life.  What film was it?

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><u>So I Have This Friend</u> is a documentary film series that promotes dialogue as a pathway to peace. Developed from the belief that well-crafted, creative storytelling cultivates a more compassionate world, this project will follow singer/songwriter Timothy Palmer, filmmaker Nathan Driskell, and Behavior Analyst Julia Smith from Germany to Jordan, the West Bank and Israel as we explore individual stories of resistance and resilience, conflict and compassion, and the forces that bind us all together.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Thanks to a generous donor, <a href=""http://www.rebuildrestorerenew.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">RE:</a>, the non-profit that I (Timothy) founded and direct, received $30,000 in initial funding for this series! So, I'm teaming up with long-time creative collaborator, Nathan Driskell, who will direct the first batch of stories we're working on. Even though we have the lion's share of funding for this project, we have until May 18 to raise an additional $2,500 to help cover the cost of film equipment and insurance. So, we thought we would reach out to each of you with an invitation to join us on this journey.  If 100 people support this project with just $25, you help ensure that we're able to capture and produce the stories of those we encounter at the quality of which we're capable, and with the care each individual story deserves. Besides the supporter perks we've included for this project, all backers will have access to behind the scenes experiences as we craft our first batch of stories. Thanks again for your support.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you're not able to support this project financially, we hope you'll consider sharing this page with your friends, family, and other folks you know. We can't wait to share these stories with you all, and we are incredibly grateful that you're willing to take these steps with us!</p>

Developed from the belief that well-crafted, creative storytelling cultivates a more compassionate world, this project will follow singer/songwriter Timothy Palmer, filmmaker Nathan Driskell, and Behavior Analyst Julia Smith from Germany to Jordan, the West Bank and Israel as we explore individual stories of resistance and resilience, conflict and compassion, and the forces that bind us all together.

What We Need & What You Get
Thanks to a generous donor, RE:, the non-profit that I (Timothy) founded and direct, received $30,000 in initial funding for this series! So, I'm teaming up with long-time creative collaborator, Nathan Driskell, who will direct the first batch of stories we're working on. Even though we have the lion's share of funding for this project, we have until May 18 to raise an additional $2,500 to help cover the cost of film equipment and insurance. So, we thought we would reach out to each of you with an invitation to join us on this journey.  If 100 people support this project with just $25, you help ensure that we're able to capture and produce the stories of those we encounter at the quality of which we're capable, and with the care each individual story deserves. Besides the supporter perks we've included for this project, all backers will have access to behind the scenes experiences as we craft our first batch of stories. Thanks again for your support.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you're not able to support this project financially, we hope you'll consider sharing this page with your friends, family, and other folks you know. We can't wait to share these stories with you all, and we are incredibly grateful that you're willing to take these steps with us!
 
Your friends.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>THE ESCORT - A Feature Film about Love, Romance, and Relationships for Today's Generation </strong> </p>
<p>‘The Escort’ is a drama with a simple concept – a young man has 60 minutes to convince an escort to leave her line of work – but despite the premise of featuring only one location and two characters the story evolves into something more, examining the state of relationships today in a digitally-obsessed world where sex is easily available at our fingertips and the idea of love has been greatly distorted. </p>
<p>Written over the course of 6 months after interviewing both current and former escorts, the film provides both an indictment of the exploitation of women in this industry while examining the wider socio-political structure of our society which has led to a segment of women feeling they have been put in a position where they have no choice but to enter this line of work. It asks the question of whether true love can be found in a profession that sells a false version of it while opening our eyes to the destruction caused for those who sell their body and those who purchase the use of one. </p>
<p>Yet at its core ‘The Escort’ is a film about two deeply flawed individuals – a woman who is no damsel in distress and a young man who is no saint – drowning in pain who over the course of their journey come to realize that they may have found their savior in each other. It is ‘Chasing Amy’ for a new generation, a film featuring two refreshingly friendly, relatable characters who engage in a frank and honest discussion about sex in a verbal battle akin to a tennis match as both try to fight for their beliefs and peel away the layers revealing who they really are. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489231490/jeoidwzxavarlsdg7kse.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>​Chasing Amy</i></p>
<p>Every generation has a film that reflects the state of relationships for themselves and for me that movie was ‘Chasing Amy’, and while we have had films both before and since from ‘Sex, Lies and Videotape’ to ‘Closer’ and ‘Shame’ no film has spoken to me more than Kevin Smith’s deeply personal story. ‘The Escort’ intends to do just that for a new generation of filmgoers as we examine the impact the social media age has played on society, relationships, and sex in general with a story that while fictional has become deeply personal as a result of the interviews held with real escorts whose stories I intend to tell.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The Goal </strong></p>
<p>With a passion to make this film I have spent the past 2 years scraping together a small budget to accomplish this goal, with a similarly passionate cast and crew coming onboard to bring the story of 'The Escort' to life.</p>
<p>And we shot the film with principal photography having completed in February with a first cut created last week. Yet with funds having been exhausted and the need to make that final stretch crucial in the post-production stage I am in need of your help to finish this project and bring ‘The Escort’ to our screens. </p>
<p>While the editors are continuing to shape the film funds will be necessary for certain requirements including grading, ADR, film festival entry fees, and ensuring costs for rewards shipping are met. In addition we are looking to reshoot one scene and for this reason I am seeking <strong>£4,000</strong> to take the final steps, although anything extra that is raised will go directly towards the film itself.</p>
<p>My intent has always been to prove that features can still be made effectively for low budgets as reflected by the works of Chris Nolan ('Following'), Robert Rodriguez ('El Mariachi'), and Kevin Smith ('Clerks'), but any extra funding would help enhance it and achieve additional goals, from post-production to submitting to a wider number of film festivals so that we may have the chance to raise awareness by reaching a wider audience through festival submissions. Any amount raised will go directly into the completion of ‘The Escort’ and I am appreciative of any support you can give. </p>
<p>With your help I believe ‘The Escort’ will be a film that not only acts as a pleasant date movie like ‘Chasing Amy’ and ‘Before Sunrise’ with food for thought but also serves to stimulate the conversation about relationships today, and lead to a wider discussion around issues which have yet to be tackled, such as the exploitation of workers and the misappropriation of talent which prevent them from achieving their dreams despite their skillsets. And ultimately to shed light on the escort industry in its current state. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Before Sunrise</i></p>
<p>If for any reason you can’t pledge funds towards this film but would like to support please share this project and spread the word to friends, family, neighbours, strangers, social media, and anyone who comes to mind for if even 1 person pledges as a result of your actions that is one step closer towards the completion of this film, so each and every person who supports this project will be the deciding factor in the completion of this film.</p>

In addition the support of Laura De Casto who was the former MD of Tartan Films aids us in navigating around any unexpected challenges which may occur, and the biggest challenges now are to reshoot one scene while improving audio via ADR and completing all other elements including grading and FX so that the film which is released will be a reflection of what was originally envisaged.
I have set a delivery date of October 2017 in order to ensure the digital downloads are sent by that time. I will also provide frequent updates via Facebook, Twitter, and this page so that you may follow and interact with us throughout the journey as the film is created and released within this timeframe.",10.0,0,"5 Campaigns

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>My name is Charlie Brant, and i'm originally from a small town in the west midlands, called Wolverhampton! I'm currently living and studying in Norwich, attending Norwich University of the Arts in my third and final year of studying Film and moving image production. </p>
<p>For my Graduation film i'm making a short documentary on the subject of myself and my dad, our relationship together and how alcoholism, addiction and tattoos have played a part in both of our lives. <br/>I wanted to document how alcoholism can have an effect on a relationship between father and daughter, and how is has been a challenge over the years when I was growing up, but now more than anything else it has brought us closer in so many ways.<br/>My documentary tells the story of my dad Darren Brant and how over the span of his life he has been through a lot, suffering with alcoholism and addiction, having to raise a daughter single handedly from a young age and going through rehab and recovery, with the light at the end of the tunnel being an unconventional method of tattoos.</p>
<p>I'm launching this campaign because this is a very personal and intimate story to both myself and my dad, one that I wanted the world to see.<br/>In the UK alcohol addiction is something that is not often spoken about. Let alone in a  positive or uplifting light, it's something that is often easily ignored or brushed off. However, alcohol dependancy occurs in 4% of Women and around 9% of Men. It's something that is a lot more common that we think, and I wanted to show mine and my dads experience with it and how our lives have both been effected by it, and that there are always options and help to those who need it, sometimes in the least obvious of places. A tattoo studio! </p>
<p>Why I need your help!</p>
<p>Films unfortunately cost a lot of money, your contributions will be going towards funding travel for myself, my subjects and crew from Norwich to Wolverhampton and  back (which happens to be an expensive train journey!) You will be also helping with cost of general production, catering and other expenses. <br/>Another thing your donations will be helping me with is funding for me to be able to enter my film into film festivals, so that I can share my film further and do some more work that I care about in the future!<br/>But there are some really cool perks for helping out with my film! So look out for those! </p>
<p>So the reason for this campaign is not only to get some contributions to my project but also to  help spread the word and to make as many people aware of what i'm doing as possible! So please share it if you can! <br/>This is a project that I care about, something that I have involved myself in and it is a story that I truly want everyone to see. </p>
<p>Overall helping me with this campaign will help me to fund not only my film, but it will allow me to take it further, it will ensure that i'm able to use my film after university, enter it into film festivals and help me to use it entering into my career in film and documentary in the future. </p>

<h3>A Still Sunrise</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Hello there!</p>
<p>We are a talented team of up and coming international filmmakers that would like to present to you an exciting project. “A Still Sunrise” is a short zombie film like no other. We are extremely passionate about this project and are seeking all the help we can to make our story a reality.</p>
<p>A very ambitious short film, “A Still Sunrise” is set in a world ravaged by a zombie outbreak. Told from the perspective of a couple still in the grip of mourning over the loss of their son; the film follows the characters of Janice, a grieving mother and her abusive husband Ben, as they try to survive in a world where the dead walk. The film deals with the complex emotions of loss, blame and abuse; a theme, unfortunately, which is still all too familiar in our society.</p>
<p>Combining the elements of a zombie horror and a family drama, “A Still Sunrise” will be a unique and powerful film that tackles difficult subjects with tension, tenderness and terror. We are very excited about this project and believe, with the right funding, can create something that will have a lasting impact on anyone who watches it.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

Geoff is co-founder, co-songwriter and plays lead guitar in a traditional rock and roll /powerpop band called The Connection. Steven Van Zandt (of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band and tv show The Sopranos) has named six Connection songs as ""Coolest Song in the World”. Putting each in heavy rotation on his Sirius XM radio show. Giving the band continual nationwide exposure. Geoff has toured Europe, Japan, Canada and America with his bands. Other notable acts, where Geoff played & is a singer-songwriter are The Guts, The New Trocaderos, Kurt Baker Band, The Queers, The Nobodys and The Useless Fucks. Clyde WardPlayed in Rock bands since school. Thin Lizzy fanatic (own everything they ever did till Phil popped his clogs - R.i.P.) Loved early Ska and also 2-tone. Punk and Oi stopped me in my tracks. The aggression and the visceral nature of it. I wanted to be part of that. Signed to EMI and then Warners before I was 20, did the Rockstar bit and have the scars. Met Gal (so far back I can’t remember) and The Gonads became a labour of love for me. We wrote and recorded a ton of stuff and it just worked, there was some kind of magic there. I now produce everything from Rock to Ska/Reggae/Street Punk to Indie Metal. I also (of course) play Bass for The Gonads.Jay LetendreRaised on classic rock, grown up on punk rock.  I strummed my way from Mid Step Crisis, to The Uprisers with Todd Radict and former Bruiser drummer Rodger Shosa all the way to 2,000 Tons of TNT with The Gonads.  A family man, a care giver, a shit giver, a Tripod; I’m punk rock till I die!Rodger ShosaI Started banging drums at the ripe ol’ age of 10, largely because I wasn’t smart enough to do anything else.  In ’84 I helped start 5 Balls of Power which lasted 3 years before the band moved to NYC and became the Radicts.   I stayed behind out of my taste for beer and lack of taste for living in NY. I then helped start a little known local Oi! band named the Bruisers with a couple old long time friends. Through the 90’s and 00’s I found myself in many different bands including the world famous Jupiter 2, the Queers, Thee Monkey Butlers and the ever so not gigging American Werewolf. A brief hiatus from drumming brought me dangerously close to getting my shit together so, with a former 5 Balls singer Todd, long time friend and cohort Adam, and the massive presence of J Tippy, we started The Uprisers.  As the song goes, punk rock ruined my life, but I wouldn’t change a thing.Corrupted YouthFrom East Los! Angeles. Nacho has been a fan of the ""Oi"" scene that Garry Bushell created since he was 15 bearing a tattoo on his arm.  Corrupted Youth created the East L.A. backyard scene as seen on the film Los Punks.  A rare punk-rock duet, they're led by old school East L.A. drunk punk singers Louie and Nacho, the crowd loves them. Their best sing along song? ""The Beer for Breakfast. MatamoskaMatamoska Straight outta Montebello, California, Ska-punk charged, english-spanish, two tone, 3rd wave & too much energy drink angst.

<p>I've researched and met so many talented and creative people in the film industry, from Actors, Directors, Cinematographers, Editors, Technicians , Production Studios etc...etc...and the FINAL team will be in place when we know our final budget.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>""Elly"" was not created overnight.  We went through several drafts before the final script was ready to shoot.  Our crew was chosen carefully, and everyone worked hard - for free - to turn this film into a reality.</p>
<p>We spent only 139 dollars to create the short film, because we did it for each other.  We know how to be thrifty, but you wouldn't know it from the final product.  It looks and sounds beautiful, and we've proven that it does not take millions of dollars to create a quality movie.</p>
<p>I'm Jeff Seemann, and this film is my creation.  I've spent countless hours perfecting ""Elly"", and I have a passionate team behind me ready to continue this project.  We are graduates (or soon-to-be graduates) from the University Of Cincinnati, and our careers are in film (and music, for our score department).  This is what we do, and we take great pride in our work.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're setting a goal of 50,000 dollars, but we think we can film the full-length version for even less.  That may sound like a lot of money, but in the film industry, it's a very small amount.</p>
<p>No massive salaries will be paid on this film.  Crew and cast will be paid a small amount for their work, and LRB Productions will use donations to feed lunch to the cast and crew on long days.  But the majority of your donations will go towards renting equipment for the shoot.  Camera, lighting, sound, locations - all of this costs money, but we know that we can do it all for a cheap rate and still deliver quality.  Just look at what we did the first time around - we can do it again!</p>
<p>We are also offering perks for your donations!  </p>
<ul>
<li>Every donation, no matter what the size, will get you an invitation to be an extra in the film.  The script takes place on a college campus, so we will need background actors of all ages - some will play students, some will be professors and faculty, and one of those people will be YOU!</li>
<li>Donations of 50 dollars or more will get your name in the credits of this film (as a contributor).  It may sound silly, but the feeling of seeing your name on the big screen....well, nothing really compares to that.</li>
<li>If you really want to get involved, I have a special treat.  One of the characters in the film will be named after you (first and last name) if you donate 1,000 or more dollars.  The name will either be spoken or shown on screen (such as a name plate on a desk, etc).  We can't promise that your character will survive, though....it is a horror film, after all.  Maybe for 5,000.......lol</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The majority of people involved in this project are college-aged filmmakers.  They've done short films and independent projects and have experience.  But for a number of them, this could be their first budgeted film with high visibility.</p>
<p>Your donation could actually help launch a film career for many people.  Trust me, that's a big deal.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that you might not be able to donate to our project.  You can still help.  Just ask me how, there are many many ways to get involved with ""Elly"", be a part of a great film, and yes....get your name in the credits!</p>

<h3>My Life Story</h3>
<p>Again, my name is Adrian Morales. And it has taken me 35 years to bring my story to life. I have worked and saved every penny to raise enough funds to produce, direct, and hire professional actors (Mexican actors) to tell my story to the world. I took a leap of faith and have spent over $110,000 dollars.  My goal and passion is to share with the world what really happened to thousands of innocent lives that were lost, massacred, or disappeared during this conflict. To date, no one has really brought any films or documentaries to life regarding this bloody conflict.  </p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I was at my house, my dad told me to go pick-up some credentials to nearest city named Jutiapa, Guatemala, this was a military zone. I had an awful feeling that things were not going to go well, and I hesitated but my father insisted I go along.  I traveled and took a bus to Juatiapa.  When I arrived, I asked for Colonel Fuentes who was in charged of the military command. </p>
<p>As time passed, Col. Fuentes never arrived and I was handcuffed and put in jail and this is where my story begins.  Tortured, beaten, and hungry I managed to escape from death.</p>
<p>Conflicts do occur throughout the world but this story really shows how the indigenous populations were targeted by the military and the right wing government. If you can feel the pain, and sorrow that I have gone through in my life, by making a donation we can be able to complete post-production of the movie. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

</div></div>","My Life Story
Again, my name is Adrian Morales. And it has taken me 35 years to bring my story to life. I have worked and saved every penny to raise enough funds to produce, direct, and hire professional actors (Mexican actors) to tell my story to the world. I took a leap of faith and have spent over $110,000 dollars.  My goal and passion is to share with the world what really happened to thousands of innocent lives that were lost, massacred, or disappeared during this conflict. To date, no one has really brought any films or documentaries to life regarding this bloody conflict.  
Short Summary
I was at my house, my dad told me to go pick-up some credentials to nearest city named Jutiapa, Guatemala, this was a military zone. I had an awful feeling that things were not going to go well, and I hesitated but my father insisted I go along.  I traveled and took a bus to Juatiapa.  When I arrived, I asked for Colonel Fuentes who was in charged of the military command. 
As time passed, Col. Fuentes never arrived and I was handcuffed and put in jail and this is where my story begins.  Tortured, beaten, and hungry I managed to escape from death.
Conflicts do occur throughout the world but this story really shows how the indigenous populations were targeted by the military and the right wing government. If you can feel the pain, and sorrow that I have gone through in my life, by making a donation we can be able to complete post-production of the movie.

The Impact
During the 1980's, there were many conflicts in Central America and covert projects in the region with the support of the Reagan administration and the CIA. El Salvador had a full-blown civil war supported by the US government, and Nicaragua had become a communist nation controlled by the Sandinistas. In the mean time, a civil war was taking place in Guatemala but this war never got the media coverage or support from other nations.  The right-wing government had a campaign of indigenous cleansing, whereby the government military wanted to completely eliminate and destroy the indigenous Maya population.
My story is one of survival. However, I was the lucky one. Thousands, upon thousands were disappeared never to be heard from again. By supporting this film, we can bring more light and exposure to what happened during this period.
This is our first project, we are new with regards to making an independent film. Nonetheless, many of the actors listed here are professionals.
 

Risks & Challenges
I have run out of funds. I have no US based contacts in the film industry. There are risks involved in not getting enough funds to complete the entire project. So far, I have spent everything I have but I never give up, and I am certain someone will help me to complete this project.

Other Ways You Can Help
Yes, we need to get a professional film editor who can help us. Film score, I still don't music in the film. I need a publicist, and a press agent. Please help me share my story and make noise about it.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Set four days after D-Day, our story follows the events of a British 2nd Special Air Service soldier that was dropped into German-occupied Normandy as part of Operation Titanic.</p>
<p>In the early hours of 6th June 1944, a small group of SAS soldiers along with hundreds of dummy paratroopers known as Ruperts were dropped by the RAF to give the illusion of a large scale parachute landing and to cause diversion, confusion and havoc before the impending Allied invasion of France later that day. Deep behind enemy lines the soldiers were left alone to fight and survive.</p>
<p>The total running time of a short submitted to the Cannes short film corner can not exceed 35 minutes, and we aim for No Glory to have a running time of around 30 minutes.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496424643/ueppt03vhw8ek1ubbms8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>NO GLORY is a tribute to all the brave men and women of the Allied Forces and I wish to dedicate the film to the bravest man I know - that handsome chap resting against the wheel of the Austin Champ in 1957, my Dad. His whole life has been a battle, he was born in 1937 and was never evacuated, spending his childhood living in London through the Blitz, and playing in the rubble of bombed houses and streets in Lambeth.

</div></div>","Summary
Set four days after D-Day, our story follows the events of a British 2nd Special Air Service soldier that was dropped into German-occupied Normandy as part of Operation Titanic.
In the early hours of 6th June 1944, a small group of SAS soldiers along with hundreds of dummy paratroopers known as Ruperts were dropped by the RAF to give the illusion of a large scale parachute landing and to cause diversion, confusion and havoc before the impending Allied invasion of France later that day. Deep behind enemy lines the soldiers were left alone to fight and survive.
The total running time of a short submitted to the Cannes short film corner can not exceed 35 minutes, and we aim for No Glory to have a running time of around 30 minutes.

NO GLORY is a tribute to all the brave men and women of the Allied Forces and I wish to dedicate the film to the bravest man I know - that handsome chap resting against the wheel of the Austin Champ in 1957, my Dad. His whole life has been a battle, he was born in 1937 and was never evacuated, spending his childhood living in London through the Blitz, and playing in the rubble of bombed houses and streets in Lambeth. He didn't see his dad (my Grandfather) for nine years as he was fighting for king and country overseas. Dad served his country as a soldier in the British Army and Ministry of Defence Police for nearly 30 years. Now in his later years in a retirement  he should be enjoying he is instead battling with prostate and bone cancer, 

My dad is a huge fan of WW2 movies, not because of the horrors of war, but for him and so many others I believe it gives some understanding as to the reason he didn't see his Dad for so many years.
World War Two was a truly horrible conflict that effects everyone of us. We all had family that played their part whether it was growing crops or working in ammunition factories at home, or serving on the front line, everyone did their bit, and it is so important we remember everyone of them and keep their memory alive, for us and future generations.

<h3><strong>Welcome to the Ancestors Rise documentary</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>KINSHIP A New Way Dreaming </strong></h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p><strong> What is Ancestors Rise? </strong></p>
<p>Ancestors Rise<strong> </strong>is a multi-media project dedicated to preserving the wisdom of our earth’s original cultures to strengthen the inter-generational link between youth and elders and create a series of film campaigns and multi-media projects that ignite humanity's collective awakening around our common origin and sacred purpose within the natural order of life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ancestors Rise asks the question: <strong><i>""How can we unlock the blessing of our planetary healing </i><i>crisis<span style=""display: none;""> </span>is by </i>reclaiming the wisdom of our ancestors to create a just, fulfilling and sustainable way of life on Earth? </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our film campaigns and media projects take you on a magnificent journey of intimate encounter with cultural custodians and revered elders that represent our earth's oldest ancestral cultures. <strong>You will learn</strong> about their prophetic messages for the current time of planetary change, and be able to apply<strong> their wisdom</strong>, to live a purposeful and spiritually connected life and activate your intended role as an Earth Steward- <strong>whilst giving back and supporting</strong> the cultural custodians and their community by choosing to sponsor our media campaigns.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why the Ancestors Rise Media Project? </strong></p>
<p>The prophetic teachings of our Earth’s original people tell us that<strong> we have chosen to be alive</strong> at a time of tremendous planetary change.This current evolutionary cycle is called Kali Yuga in India, the great Pachakuti in South America and signifies a transformation in time and a change in human consciousness, triggering a global healing crisis that is forcing us to redefine our purpose as a human beings.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>This journey of awakening </strong>leads us through a very personal and collective process of re-remembering a long-lost memory revealing to us <strong>who we are, where we come from and how we can live in harmony </strong>with each other, the earth and all living species. The original people of Peru call the age we live in Taripaypacha, the age of re-encounter, in which we are all destined to unify as one people and re-remember our Original Nature.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><i>""Ancestors Rise Media Projects intend to accelerate humanity’s awakening and support the global remembrance process of reclaiming our Original Nature"". Founder of AR, Christiane Pedros</i></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>In order to unlock the blessing of our planetary healing crisis </strong>and embark upon the journey to reclaim our Original Nature, we are advised to return to our roots and reclaim the wisdom of our ancestors, far back in time, who lived in alignment with the Life-Originating Principles, known as the Original Seeds.</p>

<h3><strong>How Your Support of the Film Campaign Will Help toward a Much Greater Cause and the Ancestor Rise Mission: </strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>• Bring Hope and Support the Global Unification Proces</strong></p>
<p>Ancestors Ris is a message of love, unity and hope from the first ancestors to all future generations and a call for humanity to return to its original purpose within the natural order of life. Let‘s remember we are one earth, one people and come from one origin.</p>
<p><br/><strong>• Preserve and Share Ancestral Wisdom</strong></p>
<p>The Ancestors Rise film series is intended to provide a direct transmission of light of the planet’s ancestors by sharing the seeds of wisdom preserved by our earth’s original people, some of whom pass on their wisdom down 70.000 years in unbroken tradition through song, sacred storytelling, ceremony, and prayer.</p>
<p><strong>• Strengthen the Intergenerational Bond</strong></p>
<p>The Original Peoples of our planet lead us back home and play an essential role in the age of re-encounter as humanity’s midwife, birthing us into the new age of unity consciousness.To preserve the wisdom for all future generations we unite elders and youth in the process of filming and reciprocate by sharing our production skills empowering a new generation of storytellers to take the light of the ancestors into the future.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>• Working with the Youth to Support the Preservation of Original Cultures</strong></p>
<p>We will provide the youth of the original community we work with a free training in media production skills and bring them on board with the development of the film series.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>• Support the Communities of our Film Messengers</strong></p>
<p>We will donate 10% of all profits made from online sales or community screenings to the community of the ancestral messengers. We will build a campaign platform to leverage the earth and community outreach initiatives of our ancestral messengers and their community.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><strong>The Ancestors Rise Promise </strong></li></ul>
<p>We strive to unite all Original Cultures and Humanity with our message, advocacy and community youth programme. By coming together, by a common vision and mission to restore people’s hearts and minds and our beloved Planet Earth. By producing the film series to bring every single human being into the healing experience of receiving a wisdom transmission of our planet’s original cultures and enable them to re-remember their Original Nature.</p>

KINSHIP A New Way Dreaming 
 
 What is Ancestors Rise? 
Ancestors Rise is a multi-media project dedicated to preserving the wisdom of our earth’s original cultures to strengthen the inter-generational link between youth and elders and create a series of film campaigns and multi-media projects that ignite humanity's collective awakening around our common origin and sacred purpose within the natural order of life.
 
Ancestors Rise asks the question: ""How can we unlock the blessing of our planetary healing crisis is by reclaiming the wisdom of our ancestors to create a just, fulfilling and sustainable way of life on Earth? 
 
Our film campaigns and media projects take you on a magnificent journey of intimate encounter with cultural custodians and revered elders that represent our earth's oldest ancestral cultures. You will learn about their prophetic messages for the current time of planetary change, and be able to apply their wisdom, to live a purposeful and spiritually connected life and activate your intended role as an Earth Steward- whilst giving back and supporting the cultural custodians and their community by choosing to sponsor our media campaigns.
 
Why the Ancestors Rise Media Project? 
The prophetic teachings of our Earth’s original people tell us that we have chosen to be alive at a time of tremendous planetary change.This current evolutionary cycle is called Kali Yuga in India, the great Pachakuti in South America and signifies a transformation in time and a change in human consciousness, triggering a global healing crisis that is forcing us to redefine our purpose as a human beings.
 
This journey of awakening leads us through a very personal and collective process of re-remembering a long-lost memory revealing to us who we are, where we come from and how we can live in harmony with each other, the earth and all living species. The original people of Peru call the age we live in Taripaypacha, the age of re-encounter, in which we are all destined to unify as one people and re-remember our Original Nature.
 
""Ancestors Rise Media Projects intend to accelerate humanity’s awakening and support the global remembrance process of reclaiming our Original Nature"". Founder of AR, Christiane Pedros
 
In order to unlock the blessing of our planetary healing crisis and embark upon the journey to reclaim our Original Nature, we are advised to return to our roots and reclaim the wisdom of our ancestors, far back in time, who lived in alignment with the Life-Originating Principles, known as the Original Seeds.
 

What is KINSHIP A New Way Dreaming Film Campaign?

 

 
Our first Ancestors Rise film campaign is dedicated to the Original People of the Great Southern Land of Burra, Australia. 
Meet with Jingki Woonganu, Chief Navigator and Guiding Light of the New Way Dreaming Movement, Award Winning Singer, Songwriter and Storyteller and the Grandmothers of the Star Skin Law of Creation.
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Film Campaign MESSAGE: 
""We gather at this point in time as part of an agreement to deliver Humanity a New Way forward from the most Easterly Point of First Light. As sovereign human beings, we participate in the sacred circle of life and by doing so take full responsibility as custodians of our land and uphold the divine and natural law. This is our Sacred Agreement that will guarantee a healthy environment and peace for all beings"".
Join us on the ""New Way Dreaming"" journey and support Jingki and the 13 Grandmothers of Star Skin Law of Creation to share their important message for humanity as we build a global film campaign to support their important community-based work in Australia.
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Throughout human history, there has been a splintering, which is leading to our disconnection and obliteration of all life. There is no room for questions only that you remember who you are, you know the way home.  As your first star family of first light, we welcome you home to join us and walk with us out of slavery.
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is a time of transformation and integration.  It is time to come into authentic wholeness.  It is the embodiment of the physical, psychological and spiritual self. Together we come sharing our gifts, wisdom and the sacred.  We acknowledge our ancestors and put the ghost of history to rest as we enter the sacred circle of life.
By healing ourselves we have the opportunity return home to the earth.  The earth holds the frequency through the lei lines (song lines – we are all of one origin – we are indigenous – we are the Blue Flame Dreaming – it is our birthright – humanities blueprint – our DNA)"". Jingki.
 

 
Your support will help produce KINSHIP A New Way Dreaming Film Campaign and allow us to create a series of multi-media offerings based on the wisdom shared by our ancestral messengers to finance the development of our organizational platform whilst paying forward a percentage to support the community projects, such as the Bush University in Australia.

How Your Support of the Film Campaign Will Help toward a Much Greater Cause and the Ancestor Rise Mission: 
 
• Bring Hope and Support the Global Unification Proces
Ancestors Ris is a message of love, unity and hope from the first ancestors to all future generations and a call for humanity to return to its original purpose within the natural order of life. Let‘s remember we are one earth, one people and come from one origin.
• Preserve and Share Ancestral Wisdom
The Ancestors Rise film series is intended to provide a direct transmission of light of the planet’s ancestors by sharing the seeds of wisdom preserved by our earth’s original people, some of whom pass on their wisdom down 70.000 years in unbroken tradition through song, sacred storytelling, ceremony, and prayer.
• Strengthen the Intergenerational Bond
The Original Peoples of our planet lead us back home and play an essential role in the age of re-encounter as humanity’s midwife, birthing us into the new age of unity consciousness.To preserve the wisdom for all future generations we unite elders and youth in the process of filming and reciprocate by sharing our production skills empowering a new generation of storytellers to take the light of the ancestors into the future.
 
• Working with the Youth to Support the Preservation of Original Cultures
We will provide the youth of the original community we work with a free training in media production skills and bring them on board with the development of the film series.
 
• Support the Communities of our Film Messengers
We will donate 10% of all profits made from online sales or community screenings to the community of the ancestral messengers. We will build a campaign platform to leverage the earth and community outreach initiatives of our ancestral messengers and their community.
 
The Ancestors Rise Promise 
We strive to unite all Original Cultures and Humanity with our message, advocacy and community youth programme. By coming together, by a common vision and mission to restore people’s hearts and minds and our beloved Planet Earth.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h3><strong><u>Premise:</u></strong></h3><p>This documentary takes us on a rollercoaster journey of getting to know Farwa, a young Muslim woman and an ambitious activist, who wants to bring change in her community. From the outside, Farwa can come across as a person who is trying to enforce her own beliefs onto others because she wears hijab. However, that isn’t the case. She is actually a soccer player by heart. She likes to participate in extreme sports. She likes watching movies, going out with friends, and listening to different genres of music. And most importantly, she has an open mind for understanding and respecting others. In other words, she is a liberal.</p><p>When you look into a religious human being, what do you think of them?</p><p>There is this presumption that religious people are conservative. That they are some how connected to terrorists. That they are immigrants. That they bring violence to the community. All these presumptions happen because they are religious, they dress a certain way or they look like they are from a certain part of the world. Presumption also exists towards culture. For example, Indian people must have a heavy accent. If you are light skin, you must be Hispanic not Indian. Everyone from Asia is either from China, Japan, or Korea.</p><p>However, that’s not true. There are many other countries that exist in Asia. In fact, India is part of Asia. The same way many religious people aren’t conservative, there are liberals who are also religious. As well as not every person who wears certain clothing, like the hijab, is a housewife. There are women out there, we now know of, that wear a hijab and are a ballerina, an athlete, and even a politician. All it took was to get to know them.</p><p>We will capture Farwa’s experience in extreme sports, throughout 5 different countries. To observe whether these presumptions exist only in the States or whether these presumptions exist throughout the world. How will human beings from other parts of the world treat her? Will they treat her differently than they will treat me; who just looks like an average woman? How will people behave when she will participate? How will she reciprocate?</p><p> </p><h3><strong><u>Why Through Extreme Sports?</u></strong></h3><p>When I think of extreme sports, I imagine a Caucasian or an African American participating. Yet, I know, people of all kinds are into the extreme sports. I’m into extreme sports. Sport in general, is a platform where it teaches us to be active and disciplined. Extreme sport is a space where we not only learn these principles but at the same time we face our fears. Fear of heights, water, speed, and gravity.</p><p>So when Farwa expressed her interest in extreme sports I was surprised. I didn’t expect her to say, “yes, I am into extreme sports as well.” I knew she is a big sports person. Still, I was so surprised. I had to take a step back and think for a while, why was I surprised? I still didn’t have an answer. Until, I came across an article about France banning burkini. The article created a positive buzz in social media. It made many furious, confused and wondered why banning burkini was necessary. Around the same time there was another article about a hijabi girl’s dream to become a professional ballerina. This article however received a mixed response from within and outside of the Muslim community. Many weren’t celebrating the idea of a hijabi girl being a Ballerina.

From the outside, Farwa can come across as a person who is trying to enforce her own beliefs onto others because she wears hijab. However, that isn’t the case. She is actually a soccer player by heart. She likes to participate in extreme sports. She likes watching movies, going out with friends, and listening to different genres of music. And most importantly, she has an open mind for understanding and respecting others. In other words, she is a liberal.When you look into a religious human being, what do you think of them?There is this presumption that religious people are conservative. That they are some how connected to terrorists. That they are immigrants. That they bring violence to the community. All these presumptions happen because they are religious, they dress a certain way or they look like they are from a certain part of the world. Presumption also exists towards culture. For example, Indian people must have a heavy accent. If you are light skin, you must be Hispanic not Indian. Everyone from Asia is either from China, Japan, or Korea.However, that’s not true. There are many other countries that exist in Asia. In fact, India is part of Asia. The same way many religious people aren’t conservative, there are liberals who are also religious. As well as not every person who wears certain clothing, like the hijab, is a housewife. There are women out there, we now know of, that wear a hijab and are a ballerina, an athlete, and even a politician. All it took was to get to know them.We will capture Farwa’s experience in extreme sports, throughout 5 different countries. To observe whether these presumptions exist only in the States or whether these presumptions exist throughout the world. How will human beings from other parts of the world treat her? Will they treat her differently than they will treat me; who just looks like an average woman? How will people behave when she will participate? How will she reciprocate? Why Through Extreme Sports?When I think of extreme sports, I imagine a Caucasian or an African American participating. Yet, I know, people of all kinds are into the extreme sports. I’m into extreme sports. Sport in general, is a platform where it teaches us to be active and disciplined. Extreme sport is a space where we not only learn these principles but at the same time we face our fears. Fear of heights, water, speed, and gravity.So when Farwa expressed her interest in extreme sports I was surprised. I didn’t expect her to say, “yes, I am into extreme sports as well.” I knew she is a big sports person. Still, I was so surprised. I had to take a step back and think for a while, why was I surprised? I still didn’t have an answer. Until, I came across an article about France banning burkini. The article created a positive buzz in social media. It made many furious, confused and wondered why banning burkini was necessary. Around the same time there was another article about a hijabi girl’s dream to become a professional ballerina. This article however received a mixed response from within and outside of the Muslim community. Many weren’t celebrating the idea of a hijabi girl being a Ballerina. This is when I realized why I was surprised when one of my best friend Farwa, whom I know for a decade, who also wears hijab expressed her interest in extreme sports.I was surprised because despite being liberal and open minded towards religion in general; there were still certain perceptions that the society taught me. A hijabi woman, not only represents her beliefs but also represents a particular lifestyle. Unfortunately most of us are raised in a society where we automatically associate certain religious attire with conservative ideology. So we get surprised, shocked and some get defensive when a hijabi girl wants to be a ballerina or play extreme sports. Our society teaches us to judge a book by its cover. In this case hijab is that cover we are taught to judge. So, despite how liberal and open-minded I thought I was; despite being a Muslim, I still judged my best friend by her cover.I jumped on the opportunity to record Farwa’s experiences into the world of extreme sports and to find out, if I’m right. If I was surprised learning about her experience, how will others react? I am curious to see if only in the states people will be surprised and react differently or do most of us judge a book by its cover, despite where we are from? About Nash (Filmmaker)I come from a conservative middle class family.

<h2>The MESSAGE</h2>
<p>Before going into detail about what this film is about, I would like to share the overall message of the story. </p>
<p>Throughout Portland's history and widespread turbulence in it's current political climate, my friends and I have soaked up information like a sponge in order to gather ideas to create a film that will cause discussion and spark a realistic flame on the Pacific Northwest film scene. Many events in this film are inspired by actions that take place every day. The sentiment of this film cements what it means to have an unbreakable group of friends through the thick and thin of domestic dispute. Considering that we have a story beyond epic, why not help us create a film worth watching?</p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>In a climate that can only be described as psychological-grunge-paradise, five friends take it upon themselves to conjure up a plan and rob their local drug trafficker in the hopes of escaping the talons of lower class despair. </p>
<h3>Visual Treatment</h3>
<p>Here are a series of pictures depicting the look of the film we plan to achieve.</p>

Before going into detail about what this film is about, I would like to share the overall message of the story. 
Throughout Portland's history and widespread turbulence in it's current political climate, my friends and I have soaked up information like a sponge in order to gather ideas to create a film that will cause discussion and spark a realistic flame on the Pacific Northwest film scene. Many events in this film are inspired by actions that take place every day. The sentiment of this film cements what it means to have an unbreakable group of friends through the thick and thin of domestic dispute. Considering that we have a story beyond epic, why not help us create a film worth watching?
Short Summary
In a climate that can only be described as psychological-grunge-paradise, five friends take it upon themselves to conjure up a plan and rob their local drug trafficker in the hopes of escaping the talons of lower class despair. 
Visual Treatment
Here are a series of pictures depicting the look of the film we plan to achieve.

What We Need & What You Get

Compared to our previous films, this has been the only one with a budget. The money will be used to make the filmmaking process exceptional.
Budget Overview
Keep in mind, our set budget reads ""$1000"" at the top of our campaign. However, we are striving for $1500!


We need money for the following: Props, set dressing, wardrobe, hair & make-up, electrical, rigging, sound, transportation, and food. Roughly a third of our project is for food and gas due to the extensive travel time for each location. Fake blood will be used in the film for death scenes (spoiler alert) as well as other various wounds. A tattoo artist has even offered to donate his services to the project (we need to provide the temporary ink). Cop outfits, rented sound equipment, witch doctor/gas masks (for a drug party masquerade), lighting gels...the list goes on. 
We have a ton of perks available. Look on the side!

The Impact
We the cast and crew of this significant body of artistic measure on all fronts, have a strong message that we feel must be known through the collaborative effort this work has undertaken. That true friendship has no color, no limits, no restrictions...even in the most detrimental of situations. By completing this project, we want to achieve recognition for a new wave of filmmaking. We will shed new light on an alternative kind of story. With mega-hollywood blockbusters filling your screens each day, wouldn't it be nice to see something true to the heart?

Risks & Challenges
Throughout this project, we hope to maintain a relatively tenacious attitude towards organization and punctuality on such a low budget. Locations can pose a threat due to the lack of weather control and studio space. 
As a director of over 13 short films and one year of film school under my belt, my goal is to maintain a consistently positive filmmaking environment. As far as weather goes, we will need to plan accordingly far enough in advance in order to get the most out of each scene we shoot.

<h3>About Us:</h3>
<p>We are a group of successful independent filmmakers in the San Francisco Bay area who have been making award winning content and producing feature films now distributed across the country. We are tackling our next feature film, an exciting psychological thriller with elements of horror, about a student with a sinister past. </p>
<p>As Bay area indie filmmakers, many films are a result of passion projects with a limited budget, and even small contributions can make a huge difference in the quality of what is produced. By producing 'Look Into The Fire' as an independent film, free of studio overheads and large star salaries, we are able to keep production costs low and that means a bigger bottom line. The film will be shot on a RED camera with Prime lenses and the filmmakers will use their vast experience, networks and resources within the community to give the film a high quality look and feel, despite the independently ""low cost"" budget.</p>
<p><strong>The Team:</strong></p>
<p>The film will be produced by Eduardo Castrillo, executive director of ‘Uncia Films, LLC’ a local independent filmmaking company based out of Fremont, CA and to date they have produced, filmed, marketed and successfully distributed five feature length films with notable name talent, such as Tom Sizemore, Eric Roberts, Clifton Powell, Miguel A. Nunez Jr, Tiny Lister Jr, Tony Todd and more! They are working in association with Bo Campbell of ‘Burnout Pictures’, who have a reputation of consistently producing award winning short films that gain lots of critical acclaim in the film festival circuits. Bringing these two powerhouses together, we hope to have another successful film for 2018!</p>
<p>Tim Morrill is the writer and director for this long-awaited project that he's been working on since 2015. He has directed / produced five short films and several commercial projects, as well formed his own production company, Full 88. </p>
<p>Jackie Dallas is an actress, best known for her role as Jen on Stranger Things and will be coming on as a producer for this film, having worked closely with both Eduardo of Uncia Films LLC, and Bo of Burnout Pictures for several years on several different projects. She has an organized and analytical background with a previous career as a medical physician and clinical research department coordinator, possesses the skills to be adept for the demands of being a film producer. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</h3>
</div><div>
<p>For 'Look Into The Fire' we will follow the blueprint of Uncia Films' previously successful films such as 'Hunting Season' and pursue funds in a multi-phase manner.</p>
<p>Our overall budget for the film will be $50,000, but in this initial phase, we are looking to raise the reasonable amount of $5000 to get the ball rolling with pre-production costs. This initial phase will serve to begin creating publicity and buzz for the upcoming film, while raising money to cover costs such as storyboarder, location scouting, location and equipment rental deposits, website hosting, casting, and crew retainers. </p>
<p>From there, we will simultaneously be approaching accredited investors and lenders for the actual filming portion of the budget, which will be phase 2 of our financing plan. A third phase will be negotiated upon distribution for backend and any differed payments.</p>
<p>As perks, we will offer the usual signed memorabilia, presale DVDs and concept art, but at higher tiers, we will also offer signed copies of the scripts used that are annotated with notes and scribbles from director and various cast and crew. Additionally, the highest contributors will get producer credit in the film, as well as an invitation to be a part of the movie and meet the actors!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our film is the most ambitious yet with the collaboration of Uncia Films and Burnout Pictures. This feature film deals with subjects such as memory loss, depression, domestic violence and suicide.  These are difficult topics that many people struggle with and have very few outlets for discussion or help. We hope to bring the conversation to the table after people watch our film. </p>
<p>Additionally, diversity and women in Hollywood is becoming a hot topic and we have a balanced cast of male and female roles, including three lead-supporting female characters. There are also two roles that are envisioned as LGBQ, and we are welcoming any and all types to submit for all roles. We hope that this will broaden opportunities for female, minority and LGBQ actors and broaden the audience's perceptions of who Hollywood should be.</p>
</div><div>
<p>Given the successful track record of Uncia Films in distributions and DVD-sales, and Burnout Pictures with award winning pictures and festival accolades, we feel that we are in a great position to impact the social setting of these topics.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>By the very nature of filmmaking, these ventures have their set of inherent risks. There always lies the chance that a film will be unable to be completed due to unforseeable circumstances, however, as this comes with a devastating effect on an independent film's production company, this will be avoided at all costs once production begins. A second risk is that the film will fail to find distribution for marketing after completion, however, as our track record suggests and with an established professional relationship with  CINEDIGM, a leading distributor of independent content to over 60,000 physical and digital retailers, including Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Target, iTunes, Netflix and Amazon, we feel confident that this will not happen. Furthermore, recent box office success of low-budget productions (‘Moonlight’, ‘Get Out’, ‘Manchester by the Sea’) have confirmed a strong, developing market for human interest, low-budget films. Strong character driven stories, rather than just star driven vehicles are in demand.</p>

<li>Food is a massively important element of filmmaking and the surest way to keep a cast and crew happy making for a better film!

<li>Location scouting: This film is looking to take place in a university classroom setting, hospital setting, CT scanning room, a house that looks like it's in the deep woods, a cabin and a gas station. If you have the perfect location for us to film and would like to get a shout out for your business or location, let us know!</li>

<h3><u>The Adventure of Jake &amp; Rusty Rogers:</u></h3>
<p>Is a short film that takes us on a young scout boy's immersive journey into the woods. He runs away from a dismantled household with his dog and a walkie-talkie, in search of Rusty Rogers, a fictional character from a film he is obsessed with. In the wilderness of the woods the only companion this boy has is Rusty Rogers guiding him through the dense forest. Soon when the sun sinks to the sky and darkness take over, it breaks his little fantasy. The dense black blanket the night forms over the forest leaves the young boy and his dog anticipating Rusty Rogers arrival.</p>

<p>The film explores the balance between Fantasy vs Reality and Good vs Evil. It plays with themes like adventure, suspense, danger, love, reality, and regret. The Adventure of Jake and Rusty Rogers truly is not only the adventure of the young kid but his father who looses him into the woods. It is definitely an adventure, either for the father or the son, whether that be good or bad. This film is being created by a highly talented and creative group of young student film makers studying at University of the Arts London.</p>
<h3><u>Plot:</u></h3>
<p>In present day England, Richard Abbott, a boy too young for his imagination, makes the decision to run away from his abusive father and to find a new life in a forest wilderness. He dreams of searching for his idol, Rusty Rogers, a handsome brash adventurer, and the hero of his favourite movie, The Adventure of Jake and Rusty Rogers. He creates a role play situation, where he pretends to talk to Rusty Rogers through his radio, while trying to find him. As time in the woods goes on, the real world catches up with Richard, and he realises that the woods is no place for a young child. Meanwhile Scott Abbott, Richard’s father, calls the police once he discovers his young son is missing. The police reassure him that they will find the child, and take him to safety. However safety may not be guaranteed for Scott, as he is now a suspect. The story ends with Richard sat up against a tree, unfound. He is truly on his last legs. In this time of despair he is finally discovered, and rescued by the one person he always wanted to find. Rusty Rogers.</p>

In partnership with YAP!, we gathered a team of talented team of artists to write and record the anthem itself, but now we're raising money to film an impactful music video that we hope will be the anthem for the women's rights movement.</p>
<p>Through a semblance of creative filmmaking and live performance, the video will highlight the issues that women across America face everyday from inequity to sexual harassment, and unrealistic body image expectations. We have filmed at several locations thus far including the Harriet Tubman National Historical Park and the Women's Rights National Historical Park in Central, New York. The project is directed by Ben Gilbarg and Angel Diaz.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our fundraising goal is $10,000. We need funding for post-production, marketing, and to hold apremiere event.</p>
<p>By donating to this project, you'll receive some cool perks, such as being in the credits as a producer, autographed posters by the cast, or receive some of our new Big Picture Anthems apparel! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With all of the inequalities facing women today both inside and outside of the workplace, we need this music video to reach the masses and give some momentum to the Women's Rights Movement.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>We are aiming for $2,500.  Even the smallest donations will go a long way. Funding will go into catering for our large cast and crew of 12+, as well as paying for hiring locations such as historical old buildings and covering the cost of our casts' fuel and parking fees. </p>

<h3>The Story </h3>
<p><strong>Curl</strong> is a fictional short about Jade, a black high school freshman, who is growing up in a predominately white environment.  When it hits national news that black kid was killed by a police officer, it seems to be all everyone can talk about. When her white friends say some racially insensitive comments, Jade is made to feel ostracized in a place she used to feel so safe. She then has to comes to terms with what it really means to be black.  </p>
<p>My name is <strong>Ayanna Smith</strong> and I'm a senior Digital Filmmaking Major at Stephens College. Curl is my senior capstone project. Growing up in a predominately white environment myself, I know how much of  an ""other"" you can feel. I wish I had a film that showed what I was feeling and validated my existence. I hope this film does this for other girls out there in similar situations.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where are the Funds Going?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Art Direction</li>
<li> Food for Crew and Cast</li>
<li> Film Festival Applications and Fees </li>
</ul>
<p>The funds are truly going to make the film come to life. We want viewers to be fully immersed in Jade's world, and this can only be done if we accurately portray her world.  </p>
<p>By donating money, you will have exclusive access to the film and merch! Make sure to check out the perks area for more details. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Curl?</h3>
<p>It's no secret that representation in media is a major issue that entertainment is facing right now. And although it is getting better, there is still a long way to go. In fact, in 2016, 78.1% of roles in films where portrayed as white actors.  (<a href=""https://socialsciences.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/UCLA-Hollywood-Diversity-Report-2018-2-27-18.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://socialsciences.ucla.edu/wp-content/uplo...</a>). </p>
<p>I've always been interested in hearing new experiences and voices that highlight everyday struggles that many people aren't aware of.  I believe Curl does just that. There are so many stories out there that have yet to be shared, and this is my little piece to give.</p>

Art Direction
 Food for Crew and Cast
 Film Festival Applications and Fees 

The funds are truly going to make the film come to life. We want viewers to be fully immersed in Jade's world, and this can only be done if we accurately portray her world.  
By donating money, you will have exclusive access to the film and merch! Make sure to check out the perks area for more details. 

Why Curl?
It's no secret that representation in media is a major issue that entertainment is facing right now. And although it is getting better, there is still a long way to go. In fact, in 2016, 78.1% of roles in films where portrayed as white actors.  (https://socialsciences.ucla.edu/wp-content/uplo...). 
I've always been interested in hearing new experiences and voices that highlight everyday struggles that many people aren't aware of.  I believe Curl does just that. There are so many stories out there that have yet to be shared, and this is my little piece to give.

Other Ways!
If you can't contribute, no big deal! You can share this with other people who might be interested! Also,  like and follow us on our social media pages and follow us along on this journey!

<h3>More About The Movie</h3>
<p><i>Nothing But the Blood</i> revolves around two characters, Jessica and Thomas. Both are drawn together by their disillusionment with religion,  and the fact that Thomas has a leadership role within the church only complicates that. When Thomas chooses to leave the church to pursue a relationship with Jessica, the other leaders within the church refuse to sit idly by.</p>
<p>When harm and hate are carried out in the name of religion, how do you respond? Do you fight fire with fire? Do you turn the other cheek? Can such hate ever be truly extinguished? <i>Nothing But the Blood</i>  examines that dilemma. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Level Up! will be SkullDuggery Theatre Film's 6th film, not counting the 2 season web series, Stuck.  We have been a Midwest mainstay, filming in Nebraska and Iowa.  We have done comedy, drama, absurdist, and Horror.  Now we want to tackle the  Action/Martial Art genre.</p>
<p>Level Up! has its main characters battling baddies from all kinds of martial arts disciplines. Our lead fight choreographer, Dean Traux,  is a certified Instructor under Dan Inosanto (Bruce Lee's protege.)  </p>
<p>We have a cast and crew of 30 people dedicated to make this a must see action ride!  Reaching our financial goal would allow us to do just that.  We will be filming in unique locations including Beercade, an arcade bar.</p>
<p>Our cast is made up of people not only trained in multiple fighting diciplines, but also are trained and seasoned actors! </p>
<p>All of SkullDuggery Theatre's films get at least one screening and in some cases have screened across the United States and have won awards.  This short will  be entered into film festivals to expand our reach.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Having 30 people, at multiple locations, filming long days, with special effects level ups the expenses.  We want to bring you the most creative fights captured by alluring cinematography that will keep you wanting more!  It takes time to prepare all of this, and as you know time is money.  Your donations will allow us to put all that we need together and deliver you a pulse pounding, eye opening experience.</p>
<p>We want you to be part of the experience for us, so your donation will allow you access to videos of behind the scenes footage, interviews, bloopers and more.  Some donations open up access to actually be on set with us, be in the movie and private screenings with cast and crew.</p>

<h3>What's it About?</h3>
<p>“Elite One” is based on the Award Winning Short Film, ""The Norwalk Witness."" It follows the story of Will Riley who is part of a classified Black Ops team, ""The Elite 12."" When he arrives home from a mission his whole world changes when his home is brutally attacked. When he tracks down those responsible and brings his own justice, he vows to fall off the grid and leave the life he once knew behind. But when he gets pulled back into the world he tried to forget, he relies on his former training to survive and bring an end to an underground organized crime ring.</p>
<h3>What Makes this Film Special and Possible?</h3>
<p>Many independent films fail due to a combination of the following factors: low-quality “look”, simple sets, bad lighting, slow-paced plots, pretentious subject matter, and lack of marketability. This film understands those shortcomings and has adapted this project to overcome them.</p>
<p>The visual quality of a movie is the first aspect of the film that people notice, whether or not one is aware of it.  To make a movie look professional depends on two very important things: the Cinematographer and the lighting.  </p>
<p>Therefore, one key aspect of the budget for this film is the equipment and hiring our cinematographer . Thankfully, we will be bringing Stephen Ling back on board for this project. Stephen’s work on  “The Norwalk Witness was incredible and gave our project a quality cinematic look.  Check out Stephen’s demo reel, by clicking this link <a href=""https://vimeo.com/189479949"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://vimeo.com/189479949</a></p>
<p>By hiring Stephen we also get full use of the “Black Magic” Mini Ursa Cinema Camera.   Although the footage recorded on a Black Magic Camera is high-definition digital imagery, it is not “video,” and the look is indistinguishable from film. Recent big-budget movies that have used this camera are Ben Hur (2016) (with Morgan Freeman), The Infiltrator (2016) (starring Bryan Cranston and John Luguizamo), and Jason Bourne (2009) (staring Matt Damon and Tommy Lee Jones).</p>
<p>This film will not have any constructed sets, but it will utilize a variety of interior locations to keep the story visually interesting. As previously mentioned, to give the film a high-budget look, beautiful, vast, desolate locations around or in the Los Angeles area will serve as a character and a marketing tool for the film.</p>
<p>Many action and suspense scenes staggered throughout the film will give both a visual interest to the story. This story, while including poignant and moving scenes, will be balanced with both a strong depth of story and very strong action sequences. These are the marketing elements necessary to this film to help it find its audience.</p>
<p>We are also fortunate to have a strong cast.  One cast member, in particular, is Hakeemshady Mohamed. Hakeem has quite an amazing backstory. He came to the U.S. as a refugee from war-torn Somalia, so his road to success in Hollywood has not been easy.  </p>
<p>He most recently co-starred in “Submergence” opposite Academy Award Winner, Alicia Vikaner (Tombraider), and James McAvoy (X-Men).  He is also currently in Production on “Triple Frontier,” Starring Ben Affleck.</p>
<p>Hakeem’s career is on the rise and having someone like him in our film gives us a very strong chance of securing distribution.  Please visit our website at <a href=""http://www.eliteonemovie.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.eliteonemovie.com</a> <span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>to </span><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>see other key cast members.  </span></p>
<h3>Why Help These Filmmakers?</h3>
</div><div>
<p>These filmmakers do not like to “sell” themselves but will answer this question numerically.</p>
<p>1. You want to support those who are following their dreams and isn’t letting reality get in the way like it does for so many people.</p>
<p>2. You (like all of us) live for good movies and powerful movie moments.</p>
<p>3. You want to donate or invest your money and see a tangible product as a result.</p>
<p>4. You believe in a filmmaker’s talent and want to give both them and the crew a chance.</p>
<p>5. You recognize that these filmmakers are not the “producer types” with an inflated ego and</p>
<p>empty promises, and you see that these filmmakers are completely straight forward from the</p>
<p>get-go.</p>
<p>6. You want to support moviemaking and you recognize that movies would not exist</p>
<p>without donors and investors like yourself.</p>
<p>7. You are interested in the story and want to see it reach fruition.</p>
<p>8. You want to be the reason that a single film (and hopefully the following films by the</p>
<p>filmmaker) exists.</p>
<p>9. You know that these filmmakers take extreme pride and dedication in their work and will</p>
<p>work endlessly until a feature film that satisfies their high standards is created.</p>
<h3>Why we need you?</h3>
<p>We need help with funding certain requirements from SAG (Screen Actors Guild).  This will be our first Feature Film that we are seeking SAG approval on.  Becoming a SAG approved project opens the door for us to be able to work with top talent, and become SAG Signatory Producers.  However, before we can become a SAG approved project there are certain requirements that we must meet, such as:  </p>
<p>1.  Required Production/Workers Compensation Insurance, and</p>
<p>2. Required pay rates for certain cast members, such as Stunt Coordinators.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you can't contribute financially, get the word out and make some noise about our campaign.</li>
<li>And please use the Indiegogo share tools for immediate posts to your social media.</li>

9. You know that these filmmakers take extreme pride and dedication in their work and will
work endlessly until a feature film that satisfies their high standards is created.
Why we need you?
We need help with funding certain requirements from SAG (Screen Actors Guild).  This will be our first Feature Film that we are seeking SAG approval on.  Becoming a SAG approved project opens the door for us to be able to work with top talent, and become SAG Signatory Producers.  However, before we can become a SAG approved project there are certain requirements that we must meet, such as:  
1.  Required Production/Workers Compensation Insurance, and
2. Required pay rates for certain cast members, such as Stunt Coordinators.

<li>focuses on ideas rather than showcasing a director,</li>
<li>fascinates its audience rather than scares or condemns them, and</li>
<li>emotionally moves them through education and entertainment rather than through only sensational amusement and distractions.</li>
</ul><p>Therefore, cinema should touch our hearts and not divide us but unite us all.</p><p>With these firm beliefs, I return to the movie scene with my new film:</p><p><strong>“THE SATYRICAL DRAMA OF ATHENS”*</strong></p><p>Preparation has been completed and I seek your support in order to be able to start shooting the film to be eligible on time for competitions at upcoming international film festivals.</p><p><strong>(*)</strong> The Satyrical Drama, which gave the inspiration for the title of this film, goes back to the third distinct genre of Ancient Drama, following Tragedy and Comedy. It combines dreamlike and playful aspects, with unpredictable transitions from drama to comedy.</p><h3><strong>About the movie</strong></h3><p>In a carefree state, where Karaghiozis lives, a Dragon suddenly occupies the city's only Aqueduct, and demands to eat as many people as he wants every day, in order to continue supplying water to his inhabitants.</p><p>Veziris, the Supreme Lord of the City, decides, with the approval of the Dragon, that everyday Dragon’s victim will be determined by a fair and indisputable draw. He gives his trusted messenger Chatziavatis the assignment to secretly inform the victims of their fate before the dawn, so that by the first light of day the inhabitants can make use of the Aqueduct without the social peace and order disturbed.</p><p>One day the draw falls on Veziri’s only daughter, the divinely beautiful Rigopoula…..</p><p>----------------</p><p>The film is a “dream-like” drama with comedic elements that addresses the current economic issues and social crisis plaguing the world, especially Greece.</p><p>The main characters are historical figures of the Greek shadow puppet theatre: Karaghiozis, Chatziavatis, Velighekas and others, who are now portrayed by human actors.</p><p>Similarly, heroic and past figures of European tradition and literature also appear: the Little Prince, the Tin Soldier and Don Quixote with Sancho Pancha, all to show how the global crisis intertwines with the Greek domestic crisis.</p><p>The aesthetics and dialogues inspired by the unique style of the Shadow Theatre ensure exciting scenes throughout the entire movie, which culminates in the battle of little Alexander with the Dragon.</p><p>All these elements make for an original film, suited for all ages, regardless of their nationality and educational background.</p><p><strong>THE MAIN CHARACTERS</strong></p><p>KARAGHIOZIS is the modern man, hungry and thirsty, who tries to survive in any way he can, seeing his problems as fate as well as an impetus for new adventures. He adapts reality to his own perceptions of truth, attempting anything to reach his goals regardless of practicality.</p><p>ALEXANDER THE GREAT is the pure, childlike soul who is full of love, with no room for fear. He is impulsive, restless, and proud and acts instantly without thinking.</p><p>CHATZIAVATIS is hypersensitive and protective of others, afraid to live for himself. Thus, his love for Rigopoula becomes platonic, replacing the possibility of consummation with the suffering of endless romantic loneliness.</p><p>RIGOPOULA is the idol of Freedom and Joy, who acquires human form through the aspirations and visions of others. She also represents the Greek concept of Gaea, or Mother Earth, endangered by irresponsible resource management, improper treatment of drastic changes in the ecosystem, and uncoordinated humanitarian efforts towards a common future.</p><p>VELIGKEKAS is the compulsive authoritarian, perceiving power as validation of his uniqueness and personal accomplishments.</p><p>BARBAGIORGOS is the innocent, self-confident man who lives impulsively, unable to comprehend the impact of his spontaneous choices.</p><h3><strong><u>ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΑ:</u></strong></h3><p><i>""Ο Δήμος Αβδελιώδης, ένας από τους σημαντικότερους  σύγχρονους Έλληνες δημιουργούς του θεάτρου και του κινηματογράφου, έχει συνδέσει το όνομά του με πρωτοποριακές παραστάσεις και ταινίες, που άνοιξαν νέους δημιουργικούς δρόμους στην Τέχνη, </i><i>με διεθνή αναγνώριση. </i>""</p><p>Μας λέει για την καινούργια του ταινία:</p><p>Η Tέχνη έχει προορισμό να εμπνέει και να δημιουργεί στους ανθρώπους ενθουσιασμό και πίστη για τη ζωή.</p><p>Το αίσθημα που κυριαρχεί σε μια περίοδο κρίσης είναι η ανασφάλεια  που δημιουργεί φόβο, αμφιβολία και αρνητικά αισθήματα.</p><p>Το αντίθετο του φόβου δεν είναι το θάρρος, αλλά η δημιουργία κι η αγάπη, γιατί δεν αφήνουν ούτε χρόνο, ούτε χώρο στον φόβο.</p><p>Πιστεύω σ’ έναν κινηματογράφο που δεν πρέπει ν’ αμφιβάλει, να καταγγέλλει και να φοβίζει τους θεατές, αλλά να τους ενθουσιάζει.</p><p>Πιστεύω σ’ έναν κινηματογράφο που γίνεται όχι για ν’ αναδειχθεί ο σκηνοθέτης, αλλά οι ιδέες που υπερασπίζεται το έργο του.</p><p>Πιστεύω σ’ έναν κινηματογράφο που δεν γίνεται για να εντυπωσιάσει τους θεατές, αλλά για να τους συγκινήσει.

He says about his new film:Art is intended to inspire and create enthusiasm to people and faith in life.The feeling that dominates in a period of crisis is insecurity, which creates fear, doubt and negative feelings.The opposite of fear is not courage but creation and love,  because they do not leave neither time nor space to fear.I believe in a cinema that
focuses on ideas rather than showcasing a director,
fascinates its audience rather than scares or condemns them, and
emotionally moves them through education and entertainment rather than through only sensational amusement and distractions.
Therefore, cinema should touch our hearts and not divide us but unite us all.With these firm beliefs, I return to the movie scene with my new film:“THE SATYRICAL DRAMA OF ATHENS”*Preparation has been completed and I seek your support in order to be able to start shooting the film to be eligible on time for competitions at upcoming international film festivals.(*) The Satyrical Drama, which gave the inspiration for the title of this film, goes back to the third distinct genre of Ancient Drama, following Tragedy and Comedy. It combines dreamlike and playful aspects, with unpredictable transitions from drama to comedy.About the movieIn a carefree state, where Karaghiozis lives, a Dragon suddenly occupies the city's only Aqueduct, and demands to eat as many people as he wants every day, in order to continue supplying water to his inhabitants.Veziris, the Supreme Lord of the City, decides, with the approval of the Dragon, that everyday Dragon’s victim will be determined by a fair and indisputable draw. He gives his trusted messenger Chatziavatis the assignment to secretly inform the victims of their fate before the dawn, so that by the first light of day the inhabitants can make use of the Aqueduct without the social peace and order disturbed.One day the draw falls on Veziri’s only daughter, the divinely beautiful Rigopoula…..----------------The film is a “dream-like” drama with comedic elements that addresses the current economic issues and social crisis plaguing the world, especially Greece.The main characters are historical figures of the Greek shadow puppet theatre: Karaghiozis, Chatziavatis, Velighekas and others, who are now portrayed by human actors.Similarly, heroic and past figures of European tradition and literature also appear: the Little Prince, the Tin Soldier and Don Quixote with Sancho Pancha, all to show how the global crisis intertwines with the Greek domestic crisis.The aesthetics and dialogues inspired by the unique style of the Shadow Theatre ensure exciting scenes throughout the entire movie, which culminates in the battle of little Alexander with the Dragon.All these elements make for an original film, suited for all ages, regardless of their nationality and educational background.THE MAIN CHARACTERSKARAGHIOZIS is the modern man, hungry and thirsty, who tries to survive in any way he can, seeing his problems as fate as well as an impetus for new adventures. He adapts reality to his own perceptions of truth, attempting anything to reach his goals regardless of practicality.ALEXANDER THE GREAT is the pure, childlike soul who is full of love, with no room for fear. He is impulsive, restless, and proud and acts instantly without thinking.CHATZIAVATIS is hypersensitive and protective of others, afraid to live for himself. Thus, his love for Rigopoula becomes platonic, replacing the possibility of consummation with the suffering of endless romantic loneliness.RIGOPOULA is the idol of Freedom and Joy, who acquires human form through the aspirations and visions of others. She also represents the Greek concept of Gaea, or Mother Earth, endangered by irresponsible resource management, improper treatment of drastic changes in the ecosystem, and uncoordinated humanitarian efforts towards a common future.VELIGKEKAS is the compulsive authoritarian, perceiving power as validation of his uniqueness and personal accomplishments.BARBAGIORGOS is the innocent, self-confident man who lives impulsively, unable to comprehend the impact of his spontaneous choices.ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΑ:""Ο Δήμος Αβδελιώδης, ένας από τους σημαντικότερους  σύγχρονους Έλληνες δημιουργούς του θεάτρου και του κινηματογράφου, έχει συνδέσει το όνομά του με πρωτοποριακές παραστάσεις και ταινίες, που άνοιξαν νέους δημιουργικούς δρόμους στην Τέχνη, με διεθνή αναγνώριση. ""Μας λέει για την καινούργια του ταινία:Η Tέχνη έχει προορισμό να εμπνέει και να δημιουργεί στους ανθρώπους ενθουσιασμό και πίστη για τη ζωή.Το αίσθημα που κυριαρχεί σε μια περίοδο κρίσης είναι η ανασφάλεια  που δημιουργεί φόβο, αμφιβολία και αρνητικά αισθήματα.Το αντίθετο του φόβου δεν είναι το θάρρος, αλλά η δημιουργία κι η αγάπη, γιατί δεν αφήνουν ούτε χρόνο, ούτε χώρο στον φόβο.Πιστεύω σ’ έναν κινηματογράφο που δεν πρέπει ν’ αμφιβάλει, να καταγγέλλει και να φοβίζει τους θεατές, αλλά να τους ενθουσιάζει.Πιστεύω σ’ έναν κινηματογράφο που γίνεται όχι για ν’ αναδειχθεί ο σκηνοθέτης, αλλά οι ιδέες που υπερασπίζεται το έργο του.Πιστεύω σ’ έναν κινηματογράφο που δεν γίνεται για να εντυπωσιάσει τους θεατές, αλλά για να τους συγκινήσει. Εφόσον συγκίνηση δεν είναι μόνον η διασκέδαση αλλά κι η ψυχαγωγία.Να συ(ν) κινείται δηλαδή και να πάλλεται συντονισμένη η ψυχή όλων μας έτσι που να μην μας χωρίζει, αλλά να μας Ενώνει.Με τα ίδια πιστεύω επανέρχομαι στον κινηματογράφο με τη νέα ταινία:                     «ΤΟ ΣΑΤΥΡΙΚΟ ΔΡΑΜΑ ΤΩΝ ΑΘΗΝΩΝ» * Με τη δική σας βοήθεια θα μπορέσω να την πραγματοποιήσω.(*)Το Σατυρικό Δράμα, που ενέπνευσε και τον τίτλο της ταινίας, ανάγεται στο τρίτο διακριτό είδος του Αρχαίου Δράματος μετά την Τραγωδία και την Κωμωδία κι έχει χαρακτήρα ονειρικό και παιγνιώδη, με διαρκείς ανατροπές από το δραματικό στο κωμικό.ΛΙΓΑ ΛΟΓΙΑ ΓΙΑ ΤΗΝ ΤΑΙΝΙΑΣε μια ξέγνοιαστη Πολιτεία που ζούσε  ο Καραγκιόζης,  ένας  Δράκος καταλαμβάνει ξαφνικά το μοναδικό Υδραγωγείο της Πόλης, και απαιτεί να τρώει κάθε μέρα όσους ανθρώπους θέλει, για να εξακολουθεί να παρέχει νερό στους κατοίκους της.Ο Βεζύρης, ο Ανώτατος Άρχων της Πόλης, με την έγκριση του Δράκου, αποφασίζει να γίνεται αδέκαστη και αδιάβλητη κλήρωση, για το ποιά θα είναι καθημερινά τα θύματα του Δράκου. Αναθέτει στον έμπιστό του αγγελιοφόρο Χατζηαβάτη, να τους ανακοινώνει το μαντάτο μυστικά πριν το χάραμα, ώστε με το πρώτο φως της μέρας να μπορούν οι κάτοικοι να παίρνουν νερό χωρίς να διαταράσσεται η  κοινωνική γαλήνη και τάξη. Μια μέρα ο κλήρος πέφτει στη μοναχοκόρη του ίδιου του Βεζύρη, την θεϊκής ομορφιάς Ρηγοπούλα…---------------Πρόκειται για ένα ονειρόδραμα με κωμικά και δραματικά στοιχεία, που αντιμετωπίζουν με ξεχωριστή ματιά το θέμα της οικονομικής και κοινωνικής κρίσης που υπάρχει σήμερα παγκόσμια και ιδιαίτερα στην Ελλάδα.Ήρωες της ταινίας είναι οι γνωστές φιγούρες του ελληνικού θεάτρου Σκιών, Καραγκιόζης, Μεγαλέξανδρος, Χατζηαβάτης, Βεληγκέκας κ.α, που παίζονται από ηθοποιούς.Εμφανίζονται επίσης κατά τον ίδιο τρόπο, ήρωες από την ευρωπαϊκή παράδοση και τη λογοτεχνία, όπως ο Μικρός Πρίγκιπας, ο Μολυβένιος στρατιώτης και ο Δον Κιχώτης με τον Σάντσο Πάντσα.Η αισθητική κι οι διάλογοι, που εμπνέονται απ’ το μοναδικό ύφος του θεάτρου Σκιών, κάνουν όλες τις σκηνές συναρπαστικές, με αποκορύφωμα την μάχη του μικρού Αλέξανδρου απέναντι στον Δράκο.Μ’ αυτά τα δεδομένα χτίζεται μια ταινία πρωτότυπη που απευθύνεται σε όλες τις ηλικίες,  ανεξαρτήτως της εθνικότητας και της παιδείας τους.ΟΙ ΚΥΡΙΟΙ ΧΑΡΑΚΤΗΡΕΣΚΑΡΑΓΚΙΟΖΗΣ: Ο σύγχρονος πλανητικός άνθρωπος που πεινάει και διψάει, προσπαθώντας να επιβιώσει με κάθε τρόπο. Προσαρμόζει την πραγματικότητα σε μια δική του εκδοχή, την οποία πιστεύει και κάνει τα πάντα για να πετύχει τον σκοπό του, ακόμα κι αν είναι ανέφικτος.ΜΕΓΑΛΕΞΑΝΔΡΟΣ: Έχει αγνή, παιδική ψυχή γεμάτη αγάπη, που δεν αφήνει κανένα απολύτως χώρο στον φόβο. Είναι παρορμητικός, αεικίνητος, περήφανος και δρα ακαριαία χωρίς να το σκεφτεί.ΧΑΤΖΗΑΒΑΤΗΣ: Υπερευαίσθητος και προστατευτικός για τους άλλους, φοβάται να ζήσει ο ίδιος πραγματικά. Έτσι ο έρωτάς του για την Ρηγοπούλα γίνεται πλατωνικός, αυτοαποκλείοντας την πιθανότητα να τον πραγματοποιήσει, βάζοντας στη θέση του τον πόνο της ατέρμονης ρομαντικής μοναχικότητας.ΡΗΓΟΠΟΥΛΑ: Το ίνδαλμα της Ελευθερίας και της Χαράς,  που αποκτά  Μορφή, μέσα από τις εκάστοτε προσδοκίες και τους οραματισμούς των ανθρώπων. Στο συγκεκριμένο έργο, ο ρόλος αυτός υπαινίσσεται και την έννοια της Γαίας(Γης), του πλανήτη που κινδυνεύει από την έλλειψη σωστής οικολογικής διαχείρισης της ενέργειας, των πόρων και την έλλειψη συνειδητών και υπεύθυνων ενεργειών για τη εφικτή λύση του προβλήματος, που έχει δημουργηθεί στο οικοσυστήμα.ΒΕΛΗΓΚΕΚΑΣ: Η αυταρχική και ψυχαναγκαστική εκδοχή του οργάνου εξουσίας, που την εκλαμβάνει ως αυτοεπιβεβαίωση της μοναδικότητάς του και της προσωπικής του καταξίωσης.ΜΠΑΡΜΠΑΓΙΩΡΓΟΣ: Ο αθώος, γεμάτος αυτοπεποίθηση άνθρωπος  που ζει παρορμητικά την κάθε στιγμή χωρίς να μπορεί να προβλέψει τ’ αποτελέσματα των αυθόρμητων επιλογών του.What We Need & What You GetThe pilot shooting is finished, not only the quality of the final result is ensured, but also the enthusiasm and the consistency of all who are involved in the project.We are asking for your participation and support to raise at least €50000 for the:1) rent of the plateau.2) rent of the equipment (camera and sound packages, electric/lighting, etc).3) construction of sceneries.so that we can start shooting by March 2019 at the latest, in order for the film to be screened in November 2019.Any additional amount will cover other necessary expenses.We believe that we can make it WITH YOUR HELP! That is why we tried to develop attractive incentives for you at every level.

</div></div>","Carter Ciaran is an experienced local theatre actor, whose dreams and ambitions minimize everything else in his personal life. His intense preparation of method acting that includes never breaking character alienates him from local productions intimidated by him and from his family who are estranged from him. However, when Carter is preparing for a new lead role as a clown, he receives news that his sister is on her deathbed. The choice Carter ultimately needs to make is to either follow his artistic aspirations or be there for his loved ones in the greatest time of need.

<h3>THE FILM</h3>
<p>Two detectives, the hardboiled misanthrope John and the idealistic recruit Mark, puzzle over the extremely violent death of Bill in his penthouse. The only suspect is Bill's wife who, splattered with blood, claims they were cooking when she left to the bathroom and came back five minutes later to find Bill already dead.</p>
<p>We follow the detectives’ imagined scenarios to get to the truth but each has his own agenda, and the truth soon becomes irrelevant, and the consequences are disastrous.</p>

<p>We exist to tell simple, emotional and provocative stories. Be they stories for brands or narrative-based drama, this is what we live for. Commercial work is our main bread and butter but the main objective is to keep making our original films with a deep focus on drama. <i>Dinner for One</i> is one of the building blocks in this endeavour and we need your help to make it happen.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>WHY MAKE THIS FILM?</h3>
<p>We are well aware that this is not a classic ""festival film"", i.e. one telling the story of a cancerous grandmother whose aids-driven transgender grandson rescues her pet and then realises a profound truth about the universe. Our film doesn't achieve any of that.</p>
<p>What we want is to offer entertainment and to tell a story which will excite, beguile and challenge you, our audience. We believe that this is what filmmaking is all about. As David Mamet wrote, ""people have tried for centuries to use drama to change people's lives, to influence, to comment, to express themselves. It doesn't work. It might be nice if it worked for those things, but it doesn't. The only thing the dramatic form is good for is telling a story."" Help us tell this one and become a part of it!</p>
<p>We are confident that <i>Dinner for One</i> will have a life of its own unrelated to its success in the festival game, but will, of course, send the film to the biggest festivals, including Cannes, Toronto, Berlinale and Telluride. We're sure there will be viewers out there who share our love for black comedy and our take on storytelling. So, viewers' votes... here we come!</p>

<p><u>Writer - Sam Jacob</u></p>
<p>Born in Ireland, Sam Jacob showed promise as a young child, his teachers not believing his creative writing homework could have possibly been conceived by a five-year-old. We’d like to think his gift has improved since he was five, through life experiences such as living on a boat in the South Pacific as a teenager, where he crashed into the Great Barrier Reef, and met (friendly) cannibals. Making short films from the age of eight, Sam returned to Ireland where he continued to hone his skills as a storyteller. Sam started working as a freelance filmmaker at the age of seventeen and went on to study screenwriting at Prague Film School. He returned to Ireland where he worked as an editor and assistant cameraman for several years, before doing a Masters in Screenwriting at Met Film School in London, completed in 2016. Sam is currently working on a TV series set in Georgia (the country not the state).</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>It's a short story but a bloody hard one to film. Bill's violent death is visualised in a series of scenarios which means a continuity nightmare and a big challenge for our art director. We're also shooting on film, which means fewer takes and more rehearsals. But we like a challenge.</p>

We exist to tell simple, emotional and provocative stories. Be they stories for brands or narrative-based drama, this is what we live for. Commercial work is our main bread and butter but the main objective is to keep making our original films with a deep focus on drama. Dinner for One is one of the building blocks in this endeavour and we need your help to make it happen.
 
WHY MAKE THIS FILM?
We are well aware that this is not a classic ""festival film"", i.e. one telling the story of a cancerous grandmother whose aids-driven transgender grandson rescues her pet and then realises a profound truth about the universe. Our film doesn't achieve any of that.
What we want is to offer entertainment and to tell a story which will excite, beguile and challenge you, our audience. We believe that this is what filmmaking is all about. As David Mamet wrote, ""people have tried for centuries to use drama to change people's lives, to influence, to comment, to express themselves. It doesn't work. It might be nice if it worked for those things, but it doesn't. The only thing the dramatic form is good for is telling a story."" Help us tell this one and become a part of it!
We are confident that Dinner for One will have a life of its own unrelated to its success in the festival game, but will, of course, send the film to the biggest festivals, including Cannes, Toronto, Berlinale and Telluride. We're sure there will be viewers out there who share our love for black comedy and our take on storytelling. So, viewers' votes... here we come!
 
THE CREATIVE CREW
 

DOP – Karol Jurga
      
For five years Karol Jurga was one of the head Directors of Photography at Sony Music. Now in freelance, Karol is a genius of visual storytelling with award-winning work in drama and commercial projects under his belt, including films for Nao, Balenciaga and Steinway.
Dinner for One is to be shot on 35mm film in a homage to film noir which is where the story has its roots.

Writer - Sam Jacob
Born in Ireland, Sam Jacob showed promise as a young child, his teachers not believing his creative writing homework could have possibly been conceived by a five-year-old. We’d like to think his gift has improved since he was five, through life experiences such as living on a boat in the South Pacific as a teenager, where he crashed into the Great Barrier Reef, and met (friendly) cannibals. Making short films from the age of eight, Sam returned to Ireland where he continued to hone his skills as a storyteller. Sam started working as a freelance filmmaker at the age of seventeen and went on to study screenwriting at Prague Film School. He returned to Ireland where he worked as an editor and assistant cameraman for several years, before doing a Masters in Screenwriting at Met Film School in London, completed in 2016. Sam is currently working on a TV series set in Georgia (the country not the state).

Costume Design - Simon Ekrelius
    
Born in Stockholm / Sweden and since 2002 based in London, Ekrelius received the Swedish Fashion Talent 2015 award after many years of actively working in the fashion industry, showing his work in Paris and London. His work featured in British Vogue, Elle Japan, Dazed and many more. Ekrelius was educated at Stockholm's Tailoring Academy and at F.I.T Florence. His portfolio includes stylist and costume design work for commercials with Channel 4, Arla, Wella, Fashion Cares, British American Tobacco and Tesco, and music artists including The Catherine Wheel, The Plasticines, Love Inc, Lucie Barât & The Au Revoirs.Illustrator & Storyboardist - Ben Barter
Ben Barter is our extremely talented illustrator in charge of all the artwork for the film. Based in the Heart of England, Ben has developed a range of innovative projects for clients such as Santander, Macmillian Education, NHS, IAAF, SEGA and many more. Ben has a unique style which he brings to bear across the many mediums he works in, from animation and graphic design to character design and book illustration.
 
CAST 
 

 
WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP


We already have c.a. 20% of the overall budget (£5000) and rely on your help to get the rest. It's a three-day shoot so everything we rent is times three, hence the weighty budget.
The money you invest will go towards paying our award-winning cast (£2600), special effects & stunts (£1000), location (£4500), kit & crew (£12000), grading and OST composition (£600). We believe in paying professionals for their work and getting the job done well, despite having done some tough negotiating to bring every cost to its minimum.
For your money, you will get a range of cool perks, including actual film props, signed script and poster, an invitation to a London-based premiere, day on set and original artworks and storyboards for the film, not to mention a chance of being the Executive Producer with an IMDb credit. 
We need to reach the minimum of £21,000 for the project to take off but ideally, want to raise £23,000 for festival fees and marketing.
 
LOCATION


This is where the murder happens... One of our inspirations for the aesthetic of the location was Edward Hopper whose works are striking with their eerie and sinister tone, ideal for a noir mystery.


 
Risks & Challenges
It's a short story but a bloody hard one to film. Bill's violent death is visualised in a series of scenarios which means a continuity nightmare and a big challenge for our art director. We're also shooting on film, which means fewer takes and more rehearsals. But we like a challenge.

<p><strong>What are we aiming to do?</strong></p>
<p><i>25 years on from Brian Lara’s world-record breaking innings for Warwickshire at Edgbaston, ‘501 not out’ tells the story of cricket’s first global superstar. It is hoped that the film will feature interviews with Lara and his close friend Dwight Yorke. It will also feature his former international and county team-mates from the historic treble winning season, Bears fans who witnessed the marathon knock first-hand and current legends of the game inspired by his heroics. Featuring rarely seen archive footage and stills, the film also examines the wider impact of the innings – coming so soon after the test record 375 - on Lara’s life and the world of cricket – including the sponsorship deals and the popular video game series - and how it helped to shape the careers of current icons Ian Bell, AB De Villiers, Chris Gayle and the ‘Burnley Lara’ James Anderson. </i></p>

<h3>The Woman Behind the Curtain</h3>
<p>The Magician's Assistant is a story almost 10 years in the making. It started off as a simple idea that I came up with at 15 years old in my sophomore year of high school, and the first script was born in an hour the moment I got home from school. </p>
<p>My name is Caledonia Hanson and I'm the proud director and writer of The Magician's Assistant. I'm a lifelong learner and born storyteller with a deep love for history and a good story. I'm a graduate of the Orange County School of the Arts for Film and Television and soon to be graduate of the Los Angeles Film School with a focus in Production Design. </p>
<p>Between not knowing how to create a project like this, not having the right resources, or simply it just not being the right time; The Magician's Assistant was a project put on the back burner, not knowing if it'll ever be made. Until now. The stars have aligned for the first time in nearly 10 years with the right time and resources and we can finally tell a tale of love the world didn't know it needed. </p>
<p>- Caledonia Hanson, Director </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Historically accurate clothing, props, and sets are needed to breathe life into this story. Everything we earn goes towards making The Magician's Assistant as visually appealing and historically accurate as possible to make this story not only something to enjoy, but connect with.  It's a story nearly 10 years in the making, and it's about time we tell it.</p>
<p>Every dollar you donate allows you to glimpse into the forgotten world of France before the 1950s. The more you give, the more you will be able to step into the past to see how a pre and post Nazi France looked.  Explore a grand theatre from the 40s, a bakery from the 30s, and a family's home from the 20s. Don't just watch the Magician's Assistant, become one with history and be a fly on the wall as you watch the story unfold. </p>
<p>Every penny will go towards the film, even if we don't meet our entire goal. Every last cent counts.</p>

<h3>What to Expect After Curtains Come Down    </h3>

<p><i>IBEX Puppetry</i>:<i> </i></p>
<p>I was animating my fourth film when Heather Henson asked me  if I would be interested in making a short puppet film about my Taíno culture.  Soon after that conversation, on September 17th 2017 hurricane María hit Puerto Rico and her winds were between category 4 and 5 which is extremely dangerous. It was  a shock to us all. Hurricane María destroyed homes, plantations and it is estimated that 4,645 people died. I was devastated for my Puerto Rico, the land were I grew up,  and the land I love.</p>

<p>Suddenly, it dawn on me that Puerto Rico wasn't getting enough attention, that food and other necessities  weren't arriving to remote areas.  I knew then that something was very wrong.  I saw that must of the help we weren't getting was due greatly because of our colonial status and old laws that keep Puerto Rico subdued. The film aims to reveal our Taíno culture but at the same time it creates awareness of the colonialism structure we were put in. I am hoping to inspire our mi gente, my Puerto Rican brothers and sisters to come up with solutions and shape our own destiny and give the new generations the tools to keep moving Puerto Rico forward.</p>

I'm excited to work with  Executive Producer Heather Henson of IBEX Puppetry. I am proud to announce that our film  Dak' Toká Taíno  will be part of the Handmade Puppet Dreams series.  

IBEX Puppetry:

The Impact
Our story needs to be told especially now because our people are dying and some remote areas  still don't have water or power. A new hurricane  season started and  my Puerto Rico still in crisis. There are about 14 projected storms for this season alone and with the possibility of 7 of those to transform into a major hurricanes.

Story
A grand-daughter (Marabelí) 10 years old visits her grandma (Yaya) after Hurricane María. The little girl expresses her fears, Abuela Yaya comforts her and reminds her how their ancestors Tainos survived. This is a sweet and warm film that will help us reflect in our future as Boricuas (Puerto Ricans).
Experts and leaders on Taíno Community
I am working closely with Antropologist Dr. Yarey Melendez founder of the Naguake schools in Puerto Rico, she currently teaches a restored  version of the Taíno language in the school curriculum, and Luis Ramos a Taíno Community leader, a Bohike (Taíno Healer) and Activist of Naguake community.
Also more leaders of our Taíno community have been interested and gave us advise, here they are: Bert Correa, Bobby Gonzalez, and Ramon Rivera. I thank you all for your input and kindness.

While on their robbing spree through Dennis’ house they discover more than they expected searching for their worldly items. The story is a comedy but touches on a layer of romanticism of an elderly couple whose fever for each other and characteristics are an embodiment of what true love should be. Their ability to be best friends and trust one and another is a highlight that will be raised through the aesthetic style of the film as well as the comedic portrayal.The Story is based on a true story and the film was first conceived as a collaborative project at University. Recently Gerald and Lexy worked together to rewrite the script and our talented Writer Lexy then put pen to paper to create the film we now love and believe in. Stealth is a fun, beautiful love story showing the lengths we would go for a loved one. MadgieOur heroine of the story she captures the camera fiercely with the fire that still burns in her eyes, but from a distance looks an ordinary lady. Leader of the operation, clever and witty she must never be underestimated. RupertThe comedy Clyde in this adventure whose clumsy nature and forgetful memory is shown in his ageing appearance. Devoted husband deaf as a bat but always masked with a smile on his face, Rupert is Madgie first and only true love and he will do anything for her.DennisA dashing silver haired fox who has been in his prime for almost half a century, he has the demeaner of a young boy in the playground who likes to hoard all his classmates’ toys however an appearance that could match any bond villain. Our team of dedicated professionals are made up of a close-knit group who happened to attend the same University, each with their very own talented skills and specialisations! Overall the production will have over twenty committed members working on the film!Director – Gerald ZibengwaGraduated in 2016, Gerald has spent the last two years working in different aspects of production from Runner, AD and Camera Assistant in a freelance capacity, Working with a variety of ormats from music to film, was able to shadow talented directors and learn from them building up to directing again. Spearheading the recruitment of the crew and getting to this stage. Very excited about the prospect of making this project as it has been in the works for a long time. Producer – Ryan Calland-Scoble Ryan a graduate of UCA and specialist in producing, has a diverse background which is a reflection in his creative style and logistical strategies. While working on shorts or documentaries he has a background of work involving advertisement and corporate video, a keen rom-com lover and festival goer! Writer – Lexy AndersonLexy whose past involvement with Raindance festival has seen her work on numerous creative shorts whether it involves writing or directing she has embarked on a creative visionary journey to tell the stories she is passionate about!Director of Photography – Matias Gaggiotti Since graduating from UCA with the crew, Matias has built a body of experience working across all visual formats, from art films to shinny commercials - passing through shorts, features and music videos. For over the past two years he has been working on British documentary and factual television programmes for the main terrestrial broadcasters. Stealth marks his return to scripted/drama/comedy of which he is very excited about!Some of the teams past work can be seen below! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmp6eScMa5s&amp...https://youtu.be/tIdG_v_aw24https://vimeo.com/114880479https://vimeo.com/220471988https://vimeo.com/kimberleycouplandWhile we have saved on costs in some areas of the film such as crew costs and equipment hire through sourcing and working for free we are portioning what we have saved to help us in other areas such as paying for quality actors as well as expanding our set design to meet the creative demands of the script.Our major costs will be significant to cover even with the money we save on these areas, which is why we need your help to achieve the creative abilities that we have set out. With your initial funding we will garner enough funds to cover our exploited areas.Take a look at our budget breakdown to see which areas of production we need to finance most.While the story is short and sweet, most logistical issues will arrive at our house location which will be shot in East London. The most challenges issues we face when dealing with this production are scheduling and our end scene. Our budget doesn't allow for comfortable shooting schedule, hopefully with the help we recieve we would be able to add another day to our schedule in our location. Getting everyone together at the same time can be an issue but through structured schedules an openness to changing with the flow we will overcome these barriers with significant results. Our other main issue will be shooting the final chase scene, which we have worked on run through for. In accomplishing this we will utilise everything from licensing and shooting rights, traffic signal block offs, road safety tests, vehicle safety tests as well as cinematic angling to fully capture our pivotal end. If you are unable to financially invest in this production, don't worry there is still plenty that you are able to achieve, you can always share, endorse and create some buzz on our social media pages, tweet us or hit us up on our Facebook page or maybe even drop us a line or give us some feedback on our email!

<p>During a creative block, I challenged my FB peeps to send a one-liner that I could turn into a short story.  A former co-worker mentioned driving past a bus stop and Christmas tree stand in the middle of nowhere.  I was intrigued.  And just like that, GREG AND THE TREE came to life. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Angelo (27) suddenly awakens from an incapacitating heroin high and is immediately thrust into the freezing waters of withdrawal. It is evident from his surroundings that his use has been habitual for a very long time. In this moment it has reached an extremity. He is scraping along rock-bottom.</p>
<p>Drenched in sweat, with a needle still sticking out of his arm, he forces his body to cooperate as he tries to open the drawer next to his bed, looking for another fix. Riddled with foil, burnt spoons, and empty syringe wrappers, the drawer does not contain what he is desperately looking for. His attempt to get out of bed results in him hitting the floor as his legs refuse to hold his weight.</p>
<p>Angelo exits his run-down flat and enters the stairwell of his building. His objective is the top floor, where his dealer resides. <strong>From this moment on, he is faced with an existential struggle as nature begins to fight back and everything is not what it seems.</strong></p>
<p>As the story progresses, Angelo is dragged through the darkest corners of his psyche, painfully exorcising the demons of his past through confrontation and agonizing self-sacrifice. He is led to his own personal hell before he can finally stand on his own two feet once again. </p>
<p>O Superman seeks to peel back the defensive layers of the pathological psyche in a thrilling and literal way so as to <strong>show the dangers of compulsive conflict avoidance with one’s own shadow and the disorders that can arise as a result</strong> (serious substance addiction in the case of Angelo). Furthermore, it seeks to <strong>demonstrate the function of pain in the healing process, as well as the necessity and difficulty of self-sacrifice</strong> in the interest of exorcising the demons of one’s past.</p>

<h3>The Funding Challenge</h3>
<p>Let's not beat around the bush. <i>We're a bunch of minimal-wage aspiring filmmakers</i>, who are doing everything possible to create impactful pieces of cinema, that will better people's lives and not be forgotten in a hurry. Since our family background somewhat prohibits us from asking our folks for a <i>small loan of a million dollars</i>, we need the help of backers like you, who believe in the potential of our project. <strong>We are no nonsense, serious creatives,</strong> and believe that with the appropriate resources, this film will undoubtedly be worthy of international festival submissions. </p>
<p>We are raising money to <strong>shoot this film in the beginning of November. </strong></p>
<p>The money that we raise through this crowdfunding campaign will be spent on: </p>
<p>- Paying actors/the crew</p>
<p>- Equipment Rental </p>
<p>- Set Design </p>
<p>- Paying for rights to the music </p>
<p>- Catering? </p>
<p>- Festival submissions</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><i>We have all met people with varying degrees of Angelo in them.</i> Even I, myself, have certainly created plenty of elaborate mental mechanisms to shield me from the painful reality of my own inadequacies and destructive tendencies. </p>
<p>We are enthusiastic about the creation of this project as we believe it carries an important message to those who view it and not only <i><strong>promotes empathy towards people who experience mental illness but also represents an opportunity for introspection.</strong></i> While the surrealistic approach helps to make the final product engaging to watch, it also provides a literal basis for interpretation, where complex ideas can be effectively communicated in an understandable way.</p>
<p>O Superman is the director's most ambitious project to date and we believe that with the appropriate resources it can truly become an impactful short film, which will remain in the minds of people for years to come.

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Welcome To Team Supreme!</h3>
<p>I am Joshua Leonard and I'm a 2D frame-by-frame animator.. I love art and storytelling. I've been drawing for over 20 years and animating for 4 years. I have a successful track record in animation including credits with the short film Mila. I am an emphatic advocate of inclusion and diversity which is why I want to create the animated short film ""Team Supreme"". I truly want to share the a message of openness and acceptance while the audience gains more perspective  on the strengths of all members of our community. Although I have seen cartoon heroes with a special need, I've never seen characters  that are young kids who all have special needs and are portrayed positively and as superheroes.  I researched  and sought out knowledgeable friends and family members to provide me with the marvelous flip side and insights about their special needs children. These children have amazing skills. I was able to feel a story of  the beauty and purpose in the lives of these children that we don't often see. I  thought how  fun it would be to have a cartoon that built around the celebration and  respect for differences  in an animated format for children and adults. Team Supreme  is a story about  adventure resilience, hope, family and fun that needs to be told  this way ,really, for all of us!</p>
<p>I have been both deeply honored and  encouraged by the outpouring of support of Team Supreme.Team Supreme has been featured in  many magazines and media outlets such as  Attn:, Aplus, Be Modern Man 100 Men of Distinction 2018, Mashable, Vibe Magazine, CBS 46, Black Enterprise, AMB Magazine, SundayTimes (Johannesburg, Africa), and VoyageATL. With the help of  our contributors, we will be able to make an industry standard animated film  that is the  new  baseline for how inclusion and diversity is presented to the next generation! I am humbled and grateful to be among those who will stand up this film.</p>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>To fly,Team Supreme will need your help securing production costs such as animators, writers, equipment,legal support, licensing costs, voice talent and insurance. You are the secret  weapon that will make these kids soar!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529670568/s9yblzsyvbcj35n0qchm.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>If we are lucky enough to exceed our initial goal of $100,000, we will still need to pursue our STRETCH GOALS of $150,000 which will allow us to secure premier voice talent, offer additional perks, cover submission fees  and travel costs to film festivals, and raise awareness through inclusive pop-ups events for the community and Team Supreme Street Team. </p> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help </h3>
<p>I understand that some of you cannot make a financial contribution at this time. But you can still  be of tremendous help!</p>
<p><u><strong>SHARE</strong></u>: You can share this page on your social media page and email contacts. This is truly important and invaluable to the success of the campaign.</p>
<p><u><strong>WORD OF MOUTH</strong></u>: PLEASE tell your friends and family about Team Supreme and how they can help make a movie that inspires, affirms and celebrates the perfection of imperfection. Please tell everyone you know how important it is to be a part of  this campaign. We truly appreciate word of mouth  endorsement from our supporters. Your personal endorsement means you stand with us and we are grateful to have  you spread the message of Team Supreme. Please use our Indiegogo share tools everywhere you can! Thank you!</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Joining this campaign means that you are a part of moving all our children and those that care for them to a table where there is a seat for everyone. There has never been a project developed around this topic in this medium of this creative and social magnitude before.  I know that these bright soaring images are needed and will inspire! Imagine how many lives we will touch by taking Team Supreme to a larger platform. </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risks and challenges relate to  the time it takes to produce an animated film. We need animators to  join the team and to be able to secure their participation to the end of the project. We need adequate funding to give the project the look and sound that is due to the subject matter and our fans.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Characters</h3>
<p>When a group of kids is born with a special need, they're Superheroes! </p>

Welcome To Team Supreme!
I am Joshua Leonard and I'm a 2D frame-by-frame animator.. I love art and storytelling. I've been drawing for over 20 years and animating for 4 years. I have a successful track record in animation including credits with the short film Mila. I am an emphatic advocate of inclusion and diversity which is why I want to create the animated short film ""Team Supreme"". I truly want to share the a message of openness and acceptance while the audience gains more perspective  on the strengths of all members of our community. Although I have seen cartoon heroes with a special need, I've never seen characters  that are young kids who all have special needs and are portrayed positively and as superheroes.  I researched  and sought out knowledgeable friends and family members to provide me with the marvelous flip side and insights about their special needs children. These children have amazing skills. I was able to feel a story of  the beauty and purpose in the lives of these children that we don't often see. I  thought how  fun it would be to have a cartoon that built around the celebration and  respect for differences  in an animated format for children and adults. Team Supreme  is a story about  adventure resilience, hope, family and fun that needs to be told  this way ,really, for all of us!
I have been both deeply honored and  encouraged by the outpouring of support of Team Supreme.Team Supreme has been featured in  many magazines and media outlets such as  Attn:, Aplus, Be Modern Man 100 Men of Distinction 2018, Mashable, Vibe Magazine, CBS 46, Black Enterprise, AMB Magazine, SundayTimes (Johannesburg, Africa), and VoyageATL. With the help of  our contributors, we will be able to make an industry standard animated film  that is the  new  baseline for how inclusion and diversity is presented to the next generation! I am humbled and grateful to be among those who will stand up this film.
What We Need 
To fly,Team Supreme will need your help securing production costs such as animators, writers, equipment,legal support, licensing costs, voice talent and insurance. You are the secret  weapon that will make these kids soar!

If we are lucky enough to exceed our initial goal of $100,000, we will still need to pursue our STRETCH GOALS of $150,000 which will allow us to secure premier voice talent, offer additional perks, cover submission fees  and travel costs to film festivals, and raise awareness through inclusive pop-ups events for the community and Team Supreme Street Team.  Other Ways You Can Help 
I understand that some of you cannot make a financial contribution at this time. But you can still  be of tremendous help!
SHARE: You can share this page on your social media page and email contacts. This is truly important and invaluable to the success of the campaign.
WORD OF MOUTH: PLEASE tell your friends and family about Team Supreme and how they can help make a movie that inspires, affirms and celebrates the perfection of imperfection. Please tell everyone you know how important it is to be a part of  this campaign. We truly appreciate word of mouth  endorsement from our supporters. Your personal endorsement means you stand with us and we are grateful to have  you spread the message of Team Supreme. Please use our Indiegogo share tools everywhere you can! Thank you!
The Impact
Joining this campaign means that you are a part of moving all our children and those that care for them to a table where there is a seat for everyone. There has never been a project developed around this topic in this medium of this creative and social magnitude before.  I know that these bright soaring images are needed and will inspire! Imagine how many lives we will touch by taking Team Supreme to a larger platform. 
Risks & Challenges
The risks and challenges relate to  the time it takes to produce an animated film. We need animators to  join the team and to be able to secure their participation to the end of the project. We need adequate funding to give the project the look and sound that is due to the subject matter and our fans.  
 
Characters
When a group of kids is born with a special need, they're Superheroes!
