<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hi! My name is Vedika and I am 17 years old- a rising senior. I was born in New Zealand and raised in Australia before moving to the United States at 12 years old. Music has been a staple in my life throughout, and I am glad you are here to see it!</li>
<li>This campaign is for my EP, my first ever independently released one as well! Doing an independent release allowed me to have so much input on my creative process, and this EP is more personal than ever. It truly encompasses my teenage years. This project is so important to me because of that. </li>
<li>If you choose to support me, you will have no idea how much you will help. You will assist me in production, mixing and mastering, PR, and marketing. Everything counts: following me on social media, streaming my music, sharing this campaign, or making a donation are all included.</li>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>I am so grateful for your support! Here is exactly what your money is going towards: $600 for mixing and mastering, $1600 for production, and $1099 for marketing.</li>
<li>I have chosen a flexible goal, so even if the funding goal is not achieved by the end of the campaign, I will still be able to use however much money was donated! I am very grateful for this opportunity.</li>

<p><i>""We didn't really consider it a serious record, which really helped because you can get bogged down in those things. We just took an approach of 'we don't know what this is, and we don't know if we're going to-put it out or what.' So for that reason, I think that it maintained a little life, and a little individuality that it probably wouldn't have had if we got too serious about the whole thing and tried to make it into an album. ~ Mark Heard""  Luckily for Heard fans, Dry Bones Dance did eventually find its way into album format and the result is nothing short of a Heard classic. Leaving behind the old ""Ideola"" sound, Heard has found what seems to be a much more comfortable niche (and perhaps a hearkening back to the old days) with some striking blues, bluegrass and folk rock music. And the lyrics...well, as expected, are second to none. Most Heard devotees would agree. Even if he didn't sound good (no chance), the lyric sheet would be worth the price of the album. Mark Heard has truly earned a place among contemporary poets.  Roberta Croteau ( Release, Fall 1990 ) © 1990 Release</i></p>
<p>Lo-Fidelity and Fingerprint Records are pleased to announce the long awaited reissue campaign for Mark Heard's ""Dry Bones Dance"".

To be able to expand and offer these albums again to the public, starting with ""Dry Bones Dance"" is an honor not taken lightly. We hope you'll join us in this journey.  </p>

Mark Heard Desert Painting - The pledge levels containing ""EVERYTHING"" will also receive a 12""x12"" high quality print of Mark's desert landscape painting, suitable for framing. All other vinyl levels can add a print of the painting to their order in the ""Add On"" section of their order during check-out. 

If we meet the goal, how long will it be before you get your pledge perks? ~ July 2021 is the projected shipping date we have listed on this campaign. This could change based on manufacturing times, unforeseen delays, etc. It will hopefully ship much sooner. July 2021 is simply a projected release month - not carved in stone. If waiting is something you're not wild about, crowdfunding might not be for you... (Just sayin')",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Farah Alvin and I'm incredibly excited to announce that I'm going into the studio to record an album. On Vinyl, my solo show homage to the very best decade of pop and rock music - the 1970's - will soon be a studio album. With arrangements by my brilliant musical collaborator, Michael Holland and help from my director Marc Tumminelli, I hope the record of On Vinyl will be a musical gift that keeps on giving for years to come. Michael and I are eager to get started on recording a studio album of On Vinyl, featuring our favorite songs with his incredible arrangements as well as songs from my follow up companion show, B-Side. Songs like: At Seventeen, Easy, Don't Cry Out Loud, As, Poetry Man, Dream On, Life On Mars and more!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What is On Vinyl?</h3>
<p>On Vinyl will be a recorded studio album based off the sold out solo shows ""On Vinyl"" and ""B-side"", featuring our favorite 70's songs with Michael Holland's incredible arrangements of songs including: At Seventeen, Easy, Don't Cry Out Loud, As, Poetry Man, Dream On, Life On Mars and more! We are seeking your help in reaching our funding goal. Every little bit helps!</p>

<h2><strong>Who are you? </strong></h2> <p>Hi all! I’m Wryn, a musician based on the Central Coast of California. My work investigates transmutation, reflection, and absorption of the self.  I pull inspiration from the many facets of my life as an artist, single parent, and non-binary human. For me, creation and performance are spiritual experiences, forms of processing, and intrinsic parts of who I am. </p>
<p>In the past I have taken my music to venues such as Webster Hall in New York City, The Hi-Hat in Los Angeles, and overseas for indie music festivals. My demos have been played on ‘Morning Becomes Eclectic’ on KCRW and recently I was featured for a second time on NPR’s All Songs Considered for my 2021 Tiny Desk Contest Entry “Patterns”.</p>
<p>Now you may ask, “How is this your debut?” This is my first time releasing under the name Wryn. I’ve taken a giant leap as an artist/person to grow and transform into my most authentic self. These songs have grown with me and are a direct result of that surrender. </p>

<p>I am excited to say that I will be working with engineer, mixer, producer, and musician Bella Blasko. She has worked on Grammy nominated/winning tracks and with some amazing artists including; The National, Bonnie Light Horseman, and Taylor Swift. </p> <p>Check out  this interview with Bella about her recent  work: </p>

<h3>What I Need  to Make This Happen</h3>
<h3>&amp; What You Get For Helping!</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Breakdown:  </strong></p>

<li>Production and Mixing: $3,000</li>
<li>Mastering: $1,000</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>       $5,800:  covers studio time</strong></p>
<p><strong>Goal 2: </strong>Hiring other artists: musicians, photographers, graphic designers. I priced this VERY low and will most likely pay out of pocket if I want to work with more than one or two people. </p>

<li>Musician/s: $500</li>
<li>Photographer/Artist/Graphic Designer/s: $500</li>
</ul>
<p>       <strong> $6,800: covers hiring artists</strong></p>
<p><strong>Goal 3:</strong> Manufacturing a physical copy of this album.  While we live in a digital age I love having a physical representation of my work. Plus, I need things to bring to gigs, sell, and spread the word! I decided to go with cassettes (don’t worry there will be a download card). I can’t tell you how many cd’s I’ve scratched up and ruined over the years. There is something tried and true about the little package of a tape that really does it for me. Of course Vinyl is always desired but I have more to say about that later…</p>

<p><strong>        $7,800:  covers the first run of tapes + download cards</strong></p> <p><strong>Goal 4: </strong>Hiring a P.R. person/firm. The unfortunate reality is that no matter how amazing someone’s work is (unless they are Beyonce status) major publications will not write about it unless it’s handed to them by a Public Relations person they know. Pitchfork, NPR (I was lucky), Stereogum etc. all receive countless submissions.  And while artists (like me) would like to keep the illusion alive that it is just hard work and musical excellence, it is really the only chance to even get heard.

<ul><li>Hiring someone for a short time for P/R: $1,200</li></ul>
<p><strong>         $9,000: Goals 1-4 Funded </strong></p>
<p>The rest of my goals are stretch goals. Meaning these are things I would LOVE but didn’t want to make the original budget any higher. </p>
<p><strong>Stretch Goal 1: <i>2 more songs!</i></strong><i> </i>It was so hard for me to cut some of my really cherished songs from the original recordings but another day of recording, studio time, producing, mixing + mastering fees seemed out of reach.

<p><strong>     $10,000: covers an additional two songs </strong></p>
<p><br/><strong>Stretch Goal 2: <i>Music Video</i></strong> - While I dabble in making videos with my ipad I would just be head over heels if I could hire someone to help me breathe one of these songs come into life.

<p><strong>Stretch Goal 3: <i>Limited Vinyl Pressing</i></strong><i>.</i> You know it, you love it -  the warm and alive tones of a record spinning, there’s really nothing that tops it. I have always dreamed of having a vinyl of my very own - with lyrics sheets, beautiful art, and lush sound. Unfortunately it is VERY expensive to create. This would be the perfect cherry on top. While I can’t guarantee they will get made (thus they aren’t a perk) I will 100% send out an email to all who donate to the cause if I make this goal. </p>
<ul><li>Limited Vinyl Pressing: $2,000</li></ul>
<p><strong>        $13,000: ALL GOALS FUNDED!!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Perks/Thank You Gifts</strong></p>
<p>For donating to this project I have some special thank you gifts. I decided not to do this in a traditional tiered fashion but there are some bundles available. These are just different ways I can show my appreciation. You can imagine it as a kind of pre-order if you’d like but really it’s about helping me birth these songs into the world. Take a peak: there are zines, concerts, demos, cassettes, commissioned songs + more. </p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The main risk of having a flexible goal is that I may not get the project funded as much as is needed. I guarantee you this album will be made eventually but it will take much more time to complete without making it past the first few goals. </p>

Our friendship was immediate and easy, and before long we were singing together. Finding our voices in harmony was like slipping on the most well-worn, comfortable, best fitting pair of jeans- as natural as if we’d been doing it forever. We share a love of many of the same genres of music and artists; mostly folk, plenty of old stuff and some new, from the well-known classics to our lesser known favorites. And so began one of our most treasured pastimes: Singing cover songs. We sang with no purpose but the joy of it and to find our voices in that delicious dance of harmony that is so healing all in itself. </p><p>When Covid hit about a year later our singing practice took on an even deeper meaning for us. It became a lifeline, an anchor, a place to renew ourselves and rest. We began to meet two and often three times a week, singing in the grass in Molly’s backyard, singing on the porch, singing by the river. We sang through hard days and better days, we sang to the neighbors and we sang to the birds. Mostly we sang to our own hearts, to help ourselves through the hardest year.</p><p>From time to time we’d share a song on social media and hear feedback from friends near and far that our harmonies and songs were helpful to them too. Seems there is just something about harmony that soothes the ragged edges of life. Recently we figured, well…why be stingy? Let’s record some of these songs and get them out there so folks can hear them whenever they'd like. And this is where you come in... We need your help. We need the miracle of crowd-funding!</p><p>We are scheduled to begin recording in two weeks at the recently opened Citizen Vinyl in downtown Asheville, NC with sound engineer and multi-instrumentalist Daniel Shearin (River Whyless). The amount we are able to raise through this fundraising campaign will determine how many songs we can record. Our dream is to record 8-10 songs which would cost around $7,000,  the amount we’ve set as our goal. If we raise half of that we can record 4-5 songs. We will truly be grateful for whatever number of songs we are able to raise the funds for, and every donation, large or small, helps us to get into that studio. <strong>We are both songwriters as well and each have a song of our own that we'd like to record if we reach our funding goal.</strong> Help us get there and you can look forward to a single from both Molly and Laura!<br/><br/>This project will help support grassroots musicians and recording engineers who have, like so many others, fallen upon hard times this past year.

<p>Just before The Pandemic locked down The Bay Area, California, I had been desperately applying for desk jobs in the tech industry -- an industry I'm familiar with and one that caused my soul to burn out when I quit tech in 2016.

What future do I want to leave for my son? How I can use my gifts to accomplish that vision? <u>Just as I was about to hang up my cello, the universe put it back into my hands. </u> </p>

<p>As with any project, there are always some inherent risks involved.

And, even if I knew all the lexicon, I’m sure I would still face the this problem. This is exactly what Wittgenstein meant when he once said that ""the limits of my language mean the limits of my world.” Words are such an amazing Human invention and, since they are born after a certain need, they can convey so much about civilizations. I’ve met many people from other cultures who’ve taught me amazing and unique words. Unique in the sense that they are <strong>untranslatable</strong>. </p><p><strong>Examples</strong>: <i>Karelu</i> (the Tulu word for the mark left on the skin by wearing something tight) or <i>Mångata</i> (the Swedish word for the road like reflection of the moon in the water).</p><p>After reflecting on the importance and beauty of these untranslatable pearls, I felt an inner urge to compose a new cycle titled “Lost in Translation”. <strong>I believe that by learning words, our conscience becomes more sensitive to others, we become more empathetic and our world becomes richer. </strong> The same happens as we are in contact with unfamiliar music. That’s why, “Lost in Translation” embraces the unknown, by having a very strong improvisational and spontaneous component, making each performance its own distinct version of the piece.</p><p> </p><p><i>Por mais fascinante que a língua Portuguesa seja, sempre tive dificuldade em expressar certas ideias usando apenas uma palavra. E, mesmo que soubesse todo o léxico, tenho a certeza que teria exactamente o mesmo problema. Isto é exatamente o que Wittgenstein quis dizer com “os limites da minha língua significam os limites do meu mundo”.  As palavras são uma incrível invenção Humana e, uma vez que surgem de uma necessidade, podem dizer muito sobre dada civilização. Ao longo da minha vida, conheci muitas pessoas de outras culturas que me ensinaram palavras incríveis e únicas. Únicas por serem <strong>intraduzíveis</strong>.</i></p><p>Karelu<i> (palavra Tulu para a marca deixada na pele por usar algo que está apertado) ou </i>Mångata<i> (palavra Sueca para o reflexo da lua na água, quando este fica como uma estrada de luz) são dois excelentes exemplos. </i></p><p><i>Após refletir sobre a importância e a beleza destas pérolas intraduzíveis, senti uma necessidade em compor um novo ciclo de música que intitulei “Lost in Translation”. <strong>Acredito que ao aprendermos palavras, a nossa consciência torna-se mais sensível aos outros, tornamo-nos mais empáticos e o mundo torna-se mais rico.</strong> O mesmo acontece quando ouvimos música que não conhecemos. É por isso que, “Lost in Translation” abraça o desconhecido, tendo uma forte componente improvisacional, tornando cada performance única.</i></p><div>

Sometimes it’s on the tip of your tongue, but sometimes there’s simply no word for that... or, at least in your language.Planned to be released in 2021, “Lost in Translation” is my new cycle of music inspired by untranslatable words from more than 10 different languages. It’s an exploration of the connections between experience, terms, and music. Discovering untranslatable words expands your sense of reality, your lexicon and spices up your curiosity for cultures. The intrepid explorers include André Matos (guitar) and José Soares (saxophone). João Almeida (trumpet) joins the group in a few tunes.I’m excited to invite you to be part of this project and I’d love to expand our collective vocabularies. Donating now will give you access to the album before its official release, to exclusives and updates. Alguma vez quiseram dizer algo mas não encontraram a palavra certa?

<br/>What is CHILD?</h3><p>On a creativity-pilgrimage to uncover my own musical expression—I discovered a sound.

This sound became an artist-persona, known as CHILD: an indie/experimental-pop hybrid, even described as a cross between Kanye West's ""Yeezy"", Bon Iver and The Weeknd. I'm not saying it's going to ""change the game""—but I feel pretty confident when I say... you've have not heard much else like it.$10,000These are funds for the cinema-grade videography, world-class mixing & mastering, top-of-the-line equipment, and the one-of-a-kind venue. If a record label saw what we're accomplishing for this amount, well... let's just say they'd start asking questions! One thing is certain, this process has revealed the effectual power of Friendship ... along with the synergy that can spark from a mutual-vision.Mixing/Mastering: Nicolas Balachandran (he's produced artists in some of your playlists)Video: Josh Etheridge (Vogue, NorthFace, he even co-shot Nick Jonas' wedding) Why This Campaign Is Unique: ""Lights, Camera, Action! Hi mom!""I wonder how many albums are live on IndieGoGo right now? Hundreds, at least.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are The Common View, an emerging indie-rock band based  between Manchester and Leeds. We have been gigging regularly for the last 2 years and we have released home-made EPs, and now we're launching this campaign to raise funds for our first studio album.  We're extremely passionate and hard working, and it's our dream to make a living from the music that we make, and to get to that level we need to record our songs in a high quality environment.    </p>
<p>The band is made up of 5 students, so you can imagine we have a pretty tight budget, which we primarily use to travel around the UK when we have gigs and for rehearsals. That's why we're looking for a bit of external help because we think that to make significant progress we need to record our next release professionally.   </p>
<p><strong>Funds are going towards:</strong></p>
<p>1. Studio and personnel hire. If we don't achieve the goal, we are going to use savings to try to complete the budget we need for a 10 song album. We estimate that the cost of the project would be between £3500 and £4000. </p>
<p><strong>Contributors can expect: </strong></p>
<p>1. Their names to be featured in the album credits. </p>
<p>2. Exclusive behind the scenes content from recording sessions. </p>
<p>3. A cover from one of the members of The Common View (just name it).</p>
<p>4. A personal video saying thanks for your contribution. </p>
<p>5. A private video lesson for guitar, bass, or drums. </p>
<p>6. Recording tips for recording your own demos (check our Spotify to check the quality). </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>1. These days production is essential to make your music stands out, so a high quality release would mean more radio airplay and more exposure. </p>
<p>2. With our latest single ""Early Grey"" we ran a fundraiser for Leeds Mind, and exceeded both initial and secondary targets.  </p>
<p>3. We're currently in conversations with a couple of studios, which have given us quotes for the recording sessions, so we are fully aware of how much we'll need to spend for this project.   </p>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><div>
<p>1. You can stream our songs because we receive royalties from streaming services, which are now the only source of income we have from music.</p>

<p>Short Summary</p>
<p>Hi everybody! I'm Kaddy Kobain and I'm super pumped to be able to, with your help, complete my first full length original album ""Black Bleach"". As we all know, 2020 has been a trying time for musicians, but I think also music is needed more than ever right now as it is the only way we can connect in these days of social distancing. For those of you that don't know me, I am a producer, singer, songwriter and entrepreneur. Originally from Indiana, I took a chance 3 years ago and moved to Atlanta to build my entrepreneurial music business and work on my artistry.</p>
<p>I have been making music since I was a teenager - the love for music was passed down to me from my parents. Sometimes people don’t understand what it means to be an entrepreneur in the music industry, and I’ll be the first to admit it is HARD. The music industry is filled with politics and superficiality, but I am here to change that and also show others that it can be done. I self funded my last album ""Nevermind The Trap: A Tribute"" which was truly worth every penny. Being that it was a cover album of the grunge rock band Nirvana, people didn't get to see my songwriting vocal abilities the way they will with this project.</p>
<p>This project is packed with songs dealing with emotions, politics, freedom, and fun, this project will be my best work yet. I believe this project will give me the momentum I need to fully break through to the masses and be the star and influence that I have worked to become. With your support, I will be able to plan and execute my next musical project and actually have a proper timeline and plan. With your help, I will make a solo album (I will produce it all on my own) and have the ability to properly market it. This album, ""Black Bleach"" will be a movie that you can watch through your ears. </p>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
<p>My team and I calculated that the budget for this album will come to $5,000. This budget will cover expenses such as studio time, production, marketing, promotion, mixing/mastering, as well as physical copies (CDs, vinyl, cassette), and merchandise. The entire album will be recorded in Atlanta, Georgia at the great Castle Hill Studios and will be mixed and mastered  by legendary Producer/engineer Justin Padron. </p>
<p>In supporting this masterpieces full formation, you are really investing. With cool perks such exclusive signed polaroids from the the recording sessions, handwritten lyrics from the album, ""Black Bleach"" on vinyl, even an actual private concert at your very home! </p>
<p>Due to the fact that this is an all or nothing campaign, if I do not reach the goal of $5,000, I will receive none of the proceeds and they will be returned, meaning the album will never get made. I have spent a lot of time creating this collection of songs and there is nothing I love more than to be able to share my voice and thoughts to the world. </p>
<p>The Impact</p>
<p>During this pandemic, I released and self funded my first album ""Nevermind The Trap: A Tribute"" which was a compilation of Nirvana songs that I recreated in a Hip-Hop meets grunge fashion. This project was all produced and sang by me and though I basically went broke to see it in full formation, I have to say it was worth every penny. Seeing the impact that it made has truly been overwhelming in the best of ways. Hearing people thanking me for making the album and gaining fans from all over the world has melted  my heart time and time again.</p>
<p>I know that consistency is a big part of making it in the music industry, and that why this fund is so vital to my team and I. This will be the first album that people will be able to see the artist that I truly am. I have made many sacrifices to get this far and I know I will have to sacrifice much more to get to the top of the mountain, but I know this is the only thing I will ever be. I was born with a gift and I know I'll never be truly happy unless I share it with the world. I didn't grow up with many options. Grew up mostly by myself and had to become an adult super early. I have a son and want to  give him more options than I had at his age. I want to show him dreams can be reality.</p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
<p>For those who can't donate, no worries. I know these times are hard for everyone, so if you would like to help in any way possible, share my music and my story, watch my videos, follow my journey, and tell people about me!!!!! Thank You!!!!!!!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>For a long time, music has been the biggest part of who I am. I’m a shy guy, words tend to escape me, but songwriting and performance have always been the easiest ways for me to express myself and let my real self shine out.</p>
<p>After a rocky road coming out of college five years ago, I immersed myself fully in the music scene around Boston, growing tremendously as a person, writer and musician. I poured all of myself into creating a record that showcased my strengths as a songwriter and was ready to take on the world. It felt like a new beginning, and as such I named the EP “Starting Over.” It felt like a fresh start, like my real musical journey was just starting. And then life happened.</p>
<p>My mental health took a nosedive and after the worst summer of my life, I decided to pack up and move to Burlington, Vermont for a very different fresh start than I had planned for. Years of constant gigging suddenly ceased as I began working full-time in the “real world” and my grand plans for the record and my musical career were put on pause. I am still insanely proud of the EP, but my world had been thrown into disarray and I was never able to give it the promotional push it deserved.</p>
<p>Fast forward almost three years since the move and life has changed quite a bit. After slowly building up a performance schedule again, I am back into performing regularly, and while there have been gaps in inspiration, I have taken the curveballs life has thrown and crafted several songs which I cannot wait to bring to life and get out into the world. The biggest part of who I am has been largely missing for a while, and I could not be more excited to be taking that dive back into it.</p>
<p>In August I will be headed into the studio to begin working with Christopher Hawthorn, who has worked on some pretty remarkable projects with local artists. My last record could not have been made without the generous support of so many wonderful people, and I hope you are as excited as I am to be a part of this new journey!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>There are many stages of this project that your pledges will be crucial to! In addition to paying for production and engineering, other costs throughout the making of the album will also include studio time, mixing, mastering, session musicians, and anything else that could possibly come our way. But the journey doesn’t end once the songs are ready to go. There's the actual making of the CDs and jackets still to go, design of artwork, and a whole host of promotional costs including advertising and submission fees. If we are able to raise enough, I also hope to make a music video! Any extra will be used promotionally.</p>
<p>Along the side of this page, you will find a number of perks to reward you for your generosity! Different pledging levels will qualify for different rewards. On the lower end, you could receive an early download of the single, a physical album, some autographed stuff; in the upper echelon, I’ll travel to you for a private show (I can play for a long time and know a lot of covers as well. My standard gig is about 3 hours)! There are a lot of things in between as well, so check it out!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By helping me make this EP a reality, you’ll be helping me achieve an important step in my musical journey.  With this release, I hope to be able to expand my fanbase, my visibility, my performing opportunities, and I strive to bring you the best possible listening experience. Music is a beautiful thing. These songs were born from a very transitional time in my life with a lot of loss, change and eventually acceptance. A singer’s songs mean a lot to him or her, but they can mean something just as important or something entirely different to a listener, and I hope to put out an experience for those who hear the record. </p>
<p>So why give me money to fund the project? Say you were going to buy the EP anyway. This just lets you purchase it a little earlier in the process rather than wait until the distribution date. You can be a part of the writing of this chapter rather than just read the finished product! And without earlier assistance from you, this release may not get to exist at all!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Unintended costs tend to arise when working on these kinds of projects, but I am doing my best to budget for this. Aside from that, the main issue is likely the timeline. Last time I recorded, music was my full-time gig so scheduling was not overly difficult. Working a day job now while trying to book recording time will be a challenge, so this project is not going to get done overnight. It will likely be months before the recording is finished, and the final product likely won't be ready for release until spring at the earliest. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Get the word out! Tell your friends, family, co-workers and others about the campaign and my music. Use sharing tools from IndieGogo to get the best results. I sincerely appreciate any amount that you are able to help this project, large, small or in between. Your support is what makes my music possible!</p>

These songs were born from a very transitional time in my life with a lot of loss, change and eventually acceptance. A singer’s songs mean a lot to him or her, but they can mean something just as important or something entirely different to a listener, and I hope to put out an experience for those who hear the record. 
So why give me money to fund the project? Say you were going to buy the EP anyway. This just lets you purchase it a little earlier in the process rather than wait until the distribution date. You can be a part of the writing of this chapter rather than just read the finished product! And without earlier assistance from you, this release may not get to exist at all!

Risks & Challenges
Unintended costs tend to arise when working on these kinds of projects, but I am doing my best to budget for this. Aside from that, the main issue is likely the timeline. Last time I recorded, music was my full-time gig so scheduling was not overly difficult. Working a day job now while trying to book recording time will be a challenge, so this project is not going to get done overnight. It will likely be months before the recording is finished, and the final product likely won't be ready for release until spring at the earliest. 

Other Ways You Can Help
Get the word out! Tell your friends, family, co-workers and others about the campaign and my music. Use sharing tools from IndieGogo to get the best results. I sincerely appreciate any amount that you are able to help this project, large, small or in between. Your support is what makes my music possible!

<p>A
short time ago, I felt a calling and burning desire to create again and explore
musical and lyrical ideas around <b>Jazz </b>and
<b>Hip-Hop</b>.  As a child of the 70s
and 80s in New York City, my musical vocabulary was informed primarily by
Hip-Hop, but also included Afro-Latin and Jazz.  And in these days of
mindless disposable music I feel obligated to put this important project
together and continue the movement of creative honest music.</p>
<p> I remember how artists like <b>Run-DMC</b>, <b>Sugar
Hill Gang</b>, <b>MC Lyte</b>, and <b>Rakim</b>, affected my life and gave me hope when I felt
hopeless during times difficulty while growing up in Bushwick (very different
from the Bushwick you may know today).  I also remember when I picked up a
cassette of <b>Miles Davis</b> at Newport where I was introduced to <b>John Coltrane</b>.
 As a student of music I am still trying to understand what I heard and
experienced. Other inspiring musical forces schooled me included <b>A Tribe Called
Quest</b>, <b>Public Enemy</b>, <b>Gangstarr</b>, <b>Jay Dilla</b>, <b>Steve Coleman</b> and so many more.  Each of these talents has uniquely colored
the landscape of my musical journey. And I would like to continue this journey
with your help.</p>

the spirit of community and collaboration I invited some of the illest legends
and up and coming artist in this hemisphere to bless us with their gifts.  We have already recorded incredible songs
with <b>Georgia Anne Muldrow, Marcus

<br/>
<br/><p>With a true desire for integrity, we
want to insure that we are continuing to pay musicians for their work and not
just asking for favors.  Know that they
have been incrediblily generous because they are just as passionate about
getting this project to you as I am. To fully round out this project we are
adding a symphonic element to the production with a live string section and
arrangements.  Your contribution will be
used for this purpose as well as for mixing and mastering.  By the way, we
are working at <b>Brooklyn Recording </b>which has hosted some of the top musicians on the planet including <b>Keith Richards,
Robert Glasper, Norah Jones, </b>and <b>Meshell Ndegeocello </b>and beyond<b>.  </b>Brooklyn Recordings is one of the
top studios in New York and are thrilled to have the one and only <b>Andrew Taub</b> engineering this project. </p>
<p>The only thing that can make this any
sweeter is the incredible packages I have put together as a special thank you
for joining the team and movement.</p>
<p>We need $10,000 to cover the recording,
mixing, musicians and mastering.  If we do not reach the entire goal, the
funds raised will still go to cover these costs and we will have to ask for a
few favors, do some bartering, use synth strings (yuck), but we will get it
done.  Our last campaign was for the Casamena Radio Hour Compilation CD
that was fully funded in less than two weeks!  I know we can do this!</p>
<p>Please check out the unique perks we have

</div><p></p></div>","James Baldwin once said in an
interview,  ""...if you can
examine and face your life you can discover the terms with which you are
connected to other lives, and they can discover too, the terms with which they
are connected to other people.""  The cultural and social
importance of Jazz and Hip-Hop and how these genres shaped their generation's
consciousness, must continue to be documented and articulated.
‘Articulated Language’ is the name of
this incredible collaborative album.  As I mentioned in the video not only am I
excited about producing this project but I am excited for you to join our team.
 I am Carlos Mena, an artist and music
producer. I have  produced music for, and
collaborated with, Grammy Winning
and Multi-Platinum selling artists
such as, Arrested Development, Tre from Pharcyde, and Jody Watley to name a few.  My
last album ""Hip-Hop Meditations"" which was described as ""...Common
and Wyclef sitting down with a book from occultist Sylvia Browne and a
bag of somethin' somethin'.""  Was very well received by critics
and fans and led to me touring around the world in support of the project.
 I have opened for everyone from Counting
Crows to The Roots, to Parliament Funkadelic to The Fugees and Black Eyed Peas.  After years of touring, remixing songs for
dance labels and began running my own label ‘Ocha Records’.




A
short time ago, I felt a calling and burning desire to create again and explore
musical and lyrical ideas around Jazz and
Hip-Hop.  As a child of the 70s
and 80s in New York City, my musical vocabulary was informed primarily by
Hip-Hop, but also included Afro-Latin and Jazz.  And in these days of
mindless disposable music I feel obligated to put this important project
together and continue the movement of creative honest music.
 I remember how artists like Run-DMC, Sugar
Hill Gang, MC Lyte, and Rakim, affected my life and gave me hope when I felt
hopeless during times difficulty while growing up in Bushwick (very different
from the Bushwick you may know today).  I also remember when I picked up a
cassette of Miles Davis at Newport where I was introduced to John Coltrane.
 As a student of music I am still trying to understand what I heard and
experienced. Other inspiring musical forces schooled me included A Tribe Called
Quest, Public Enemy, Gangstarr, Jay Dilla, Steve Coleman and so many more.  Each of these talents has uniquely colored
the landscape of my musical journey. And I would like to continue this journey
with your help.






In
the spirit of community and collaboration I invited some of the illest legends
and up and coming artist in this hemisphere to bless us with their gifts.  We have already recorded incredible songs
with Georgia Anne Muldrow, Marcus
Gilmore (Flying Lotus, Chick Correa), Lazaro Galaragga (Herbie Hancock, Cachao,
Paquito D'Rivera), Vinia Mojica (De La Soul, Mos Def, ATCQ), Victoria Theodore
(Stevie Wonder, Arsenio Hall Show) Burniss Earl Travis (Robert Glasper), Marcus
Machado (Rolling Stones Magazine Next Young Gun), Farnell Newton (Jill Scott), my
brothers Osunlade and Ezel, and producers like Kokayi, Jazzmattik, and Navi Beats.
We are adding other talents as we speak and as a part of the team you will be
the first to know. 





With a true desire for integrity, we
want to insure that we are continuing to pay musicians for their work and not
just asking for favors.  Know that they
have been incrediblily generous because they are just as passionate about
getting this project to you as I am. To fully round out this project we are
adding a symphonic element to the production with a live string section and
arrangements.  Your contribution will be
used for this purpose as well as for mixing and mastering.  By the way, we
are working at Brooklyn Recording which has hosted some of the top musicians on the planet including Keith Richards,
Robert Glasper, Norah Jones, and Meshell Ndegeocello and beyond.  Brooklyn Recordings is one of the
top studios in New York and are thrilled to have the one and only Andrew Taub engineering this project. 
The only thing that can make this any
sweeter is the incredible packages I have put together as a special thank you
for joining the team and movement.
We need $10,000 to cover the recording,
mixing, musicians and mastering.  If we do not reach the entire goal, the
funds raised will still go to cover these costs and we will have to ask for a
few favors, do some bartering, use synth strings (yuck), but we will get it
done.  Our last campaign was for the Casamena Radio Hour Compilation CD
that was fully funded in less than two weeks!  I know we can do this!
Please check out the unique perks we have
available.  Some even include exclusive gear, vinyl, and you can even join
us in the studio!
I know that for some of you even $5 can be a lot to ask.  Please support us however you can.  You can use the Indiegogo share tools to help spread the word on on Facebook and Twitter.  Thank you soooo much!",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Songs for the Breakdown is almost here!</h3>
<p>Friends, I made an album that I can't wait to share with you. It feels like a personal departure from anything I've done before, exploring peaks and valleys of my own experience, and touching on some of the bigger themes that keep us all connected, while exploring new musical edges, and pushing myself both in the lyrical content and compositional arrangement. </p>
<p>The album feature's my band, who I like to call ""The Good Dream"" and the good news is that you too can be a part of ""Maya Elise &amp; The Good Dream"". </p>
<p>The tracks are recorded, mixed, mastered, and sitting in a dropbox file, but I need your support in order to get them to your ears! </p>
</div><div>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Goal:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>If I've learned anything about this process, is that if you want to do it sustainably, it isn't quite the cheapest endeavor. Sustainable, to me, means choosing eco-friendly printers for the vinyl &amp; merch, recording as much as we can in one go to avoid multiple trips, and fairly paying artists and designers, so that they can live a more sustainable life as an artist. The total cost of making this album is about $9,000. I have invested all funds from my Patreon into the production, and I am left with about $7,500 to make back up - so that is where you come in!</li>
<li>There is so much here to snag while you can, including a limited edition vinyl, a *naturally-dyed* shirt (hand-dyed by me), a digital-illustrated songbook of all the original songs on the album, and more (all delivered August 2021)!</li>
<li>In order to receive all of the funds, I need to reach my goal! Will you help me get there? </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">How This Works &amp; Why Support?</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Choose a ""perk"" level. Each level contains different items that I will ship to you, but don't worry, if you want an extra vinyl or CD or shirt, you can add that on at the checkout. </li>
<li>A successful pre-order campaign leads to a successful launch, which leads to all sorts of growth for me and my band down the line, allowing for a sustainable music career for all of us.</li>
<li>And here is some honesty: most people who listen to this album will probably stream it on Spotify or Apple music (yay!). With the amount of money streaming services pay the artists, my songs would need to be streamed for over 12 years straight in order to make it to my goal of $7,500. Yikes! </li>

H. E. is many things, but let me begin by sharing a few of its components. S.H.E. is...       ✧  A 3-Song E.P.      ✧   My Artistic Debut as LADY MU.      ✧   3 Music Videos that weave together as a seem-less cinematic journey of song, dance, and ceremonial storytelling. The Heart of S.H.E. is composed of 3 powerful songs that came through me whole and complete from a source I honor as the Feminine Aspect of Creation. Each of these songs is connected to an Archetype of the Feminine... THE MAIDEN - THE MOTHER - THE WISE WOMAN...and each of these potent songs will be accompanied by Music videos that weave together as a cinematic Muse-ical that brings the viewer through a timeless tale of initiation into the Mysteries of the Goddess. LADY MU & THE MU MISSION Some of you may know me as a Healer, some of you may know me as a singer/songwriter, some of you may know me as an Actress, some of you may know me as a Director & Visionary...and in essence, LADY MU is all parts of me woven into an integrated expression of my lifetime dedication to the Art of being a Muse.My Mission as LADY MU is to give a Powerful Voice to the Feminine Creator through the Ancient-Feminine Arts of Song, Dance, and Ceremonial Storytelling. As a channel for our Cosmic Mother - I aim to create exquisite entertainment that is rooted in service to the healing, evolution, and reverence of all Life on this planet. SUPPORTING S.H.E. & THE MU MEDICINE EXCHANGE As many of you may know, bringing Music and Film into the world in a professional quality takes funding beyond what any independent artist can typically shoulder.  While I am wholeheartedly investing my own savings and taking out a small business loan for this project, it will not be enough to cover all of the necessary costs of creating S.H.E.Though it’s never easy to ask for help, I know it is time to humbly ask for support from my commUnity and Allies who can bring this vision into the world with their love and backing. There is such power in numbers, and with a little bit of financial support from many I will be able to give life to this creation!And in Sacred reciprocity for all those who generously support S.H.E. I have an array of Mu Medicine Offerings…Everything from my recorded Sound Ceremonies, Mu Medicine Bags & Handcrafted goodies, One-on One Sessions, 3 Month Metamorphosis Mentorship, a Private Medicine Immersion with yours truly…and infinitely more!To give you an idea of what your generous offerings will be going towards, I have broken down the budget for this project below…[listed in order of funding prioritization] RECORDING - $7,000

For in the coming times, I believe S.H.E. is the one who will teach us to live in harmony with ALL LIFE and lead us home to our Hearts. ARTISTIC RISKS & REWARDS Making independent art always requires immense courage and a deep trust in the creation you are bringing into the world. This project will take 100's of hours, love, resilience, leadership, commitment, financial risk, and unwavering certainty ~ but I have never been more willing to offer myself so fully for a project (materially, emotionally, & spiritually).The truth is whether I receive $1 or all $16,600 – I will find a way to bring this vision into the world, because it is what I am here to do!However, without financial support, it will take far longer and require that I put myself in greater debt, which is never ideal as an independent artist.

<p>Greetings, I’m <a href=""http://www.danwestinc.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dan West</a>, pianist/composer/arranger/producer coming to you from scenic Shadow Hills, California. Big band music is near and dear to my heart. From the first time my parents played big band vinyl in our living room when I was a tyke, I knew I was listening to something special. As I absorbed music composed by Duke Ellington, Billy Strayhorn, Nelson Riddle, Clare Fischer and others, I poured over the record covers, reading the liner notes, enthralled by the imagery of the band immaculately dressed to the nines. The nuanced layers of ensemble compositions truly swing, and constitute a rich, sophisticated musical dynamic like no other.</p>
<p>It's no wonder that this genre took hold of the jazz world and music fans for decades, captivating live audiences, rapt listeners on the radio, and dancers in ballrooms the world over. Long before Elvis, Big Band swing was the genre that raised the morale for troops on the war front which made band leaders to me feel larger than life.</p>
<p>These composers were true storytellers, creating wondrous works of art that have stood the test of time, becoming the memorable standards of the modern day and going forward. For many years now, I have been composing and arranging my own works for Big Band. Many of these pieces have been performed by accomplished musicians here in Los Angeles and none of them have ever been properly recorded.</p>
<p>When the quarantine hit in March of 2020, I figured I would take advantage of the extra down time and begin the process of finally realizing the dream of getting these arrangements recorded. Much of the passion I feel in recording my Big Band album revolves around keeping this timeless genre alive.</p>
<p>In my career, I have worked with a wide array of artists producing and arranging in the Pop and Jazz fields. Some of my collaborations include arranging for seasoned jazz artists such as <a href=""http://www.garyherbig.com/html/home.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gary Herbig</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ralphdudleymusic/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ralph Dudley</a>, <a href=""https://jeffpifher.com/socrates-trial"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Socrates Trial</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/This-Aint-Your-Daddys-Big-Band-192796248599/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">This Ain’t Your Daddy’s Big Band</a>, and <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/artist/0JpZ2oPUpSXwDHkH3JQiSH"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Speakeasy Spies</a>.

<p>So far, we have recorded three arrangements. My goal is to continue this process which includes tracking a dozen original arrangements including my big band tributes to Nirvana, Jimi Hendrix and Herbie Hancock. In order to do this, I will need to raise money to complete the project. The musicians involved need to be compensated as well as the arranger.</p>
<p>Therefore, I have launched this campaign where my dear friends, associates and devoted lovers of the arts can contribute whatever they can to help fully realize this vision. As a thank you, we're offering exciting perks ranging from autographed copies of the forthcoming recording on vinyl, to a piano or arranging lesson, one of my original paintings, a personalized arrangement of your favorite song and a thank you on the album credits.</p>
<p>One final point that is important to me. As a producer of, and teacher and mentor to young students and musicians today, I'm delighted to see how they embrace Big Band music. I'm hoping this project inspires the next great generation of musicians to honor and continue this elevated art form in their own way. Any contribution you make to this project also serves as a tool and an incentive for upcoming young talent to achieve that dream.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time. I hope you all will share this campaign with friends and family, and, to music lovers, art lovers and historians with whom I have no doubt, this project will resonate. My heartfelt thanks to all of you for hearing my story. In my eyes, each and every one of you are true Kings and Queens of Swing.</p>

<h3>Wilfy Williams Brand New Album 2021!</h3>
<p>After Wilfy's first Album The Pledge was crowdfunded in 2014, Wilfy went on to play live on BBC Radio 1. It's been a long 6 years since Wilfy has released any new songs so why now?</p>
<p><strong>The Return of the Wilfy</strong></p>
<p>After the success of the first album Wilfy was inspired to return to education to master his craft and was determined to reward his fans with something we could all be proud of.  So Wilfy returned to University and graduated with a degree in Music in 2018 and then graduated with a Masters degree in Music Performance in 2019. Just a few months later Wilfy went viral when busking in London. Putting his crowd-pleasing musical skills to good use he incited joy on the London Underground and made the national news, receiving over 6 million social media views and shares in a day. The pandemic has stopped Wilfy entertaining the crowds, but this time has enabled him to craft and complete the most inspiring album of new songs - and he's now excited to get into the groove in the studio.</p>
<p><strong>A New Hope</strong></p>
<p>Wilfy has teamed up with producer Rob Toulson (Talvin Singh, Mediaeval Babes, Daisy and the Dark) and they are already creating magic in the studio. So its that time again to gather round, get your face on the album artwork, get ready to conga away and contribute to Wilfy's first release since 2014! We are aiming to raise 1k to fund the album, which will cover the remaining production costs and the time of many wonderful musicians Wilfy has met along his journey.</p>
<p>Here is how you will help;</p>
<ul>
<li>Wilfy is offering you the first download of the album as soon as it arrives back from being mastered and that could be months before the public will hear it.</li>
<li>There is also the chance to have your face on the album artwork! If you pledge a contribution you can have you or a loved ones face in a beautifully designed mosaic, which worked really well on the first album and is a thank you from Wilfy to you for supporting him.</li>
<li>You can participate in a live performance gig which is planned for a live venue in 2021 (Covid permitting). Wilfy is also offering the chance to book an intimate zoom gig with him.</li>
<li>Companies looking for some creative visibility can also sponsor the album. Wilfy will share sponsor logos and weblink's throughout his social media campaign. Private online gigs are also amongst the perks for album sponsors. </li>
</ul>
<p>So you've read this far and we can say you are already a part of the Wilfy family. With his charismatic charm and energy, you can look forward to sharing this amazing journey with Wilfy which is sure to be full of star studded opportunities and exploits.</p>
<p><i>""Thank you so much for all your support, my supporters have always supported me with the same passion I put into my music. This album has taken me 6 years to write because I wanted to produce for you something world class to say thank you for sticking with me. Was so much fun playing Live on Radio 1, and being seen by millions online performing music. Please continue your magical support and I am excited to let you hear something I feel we will all be so proud of. Oh and I want to see your face on the artwork again! Just a way for us all to be involved. Lots of love. Wilfy Feb 2021.""</i></p>

<h3>Highways and Rocketships: Florence's Story</h3>
<p>I am a Nashville-born, North Carolina-based independent musical artist making a new record, <i>Highways and Rocketships</i>. Some of you will already know that there have been all kinds of twists and turns on the road from my first record <i>Perfect City </i>(Slewfoot 2001) to <i>Highways and Rocketships. </i>I spent a lot of time between then and now riding around on Steve Earle’s tour bus, catching up with my Dukes-drumming husband Will Rigby, and getting tenure at UNC. I wrote a book on rock and roll and put on a conference at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, eventually taking a seat on the board at the Bob Dylan Institute as well. Somewhere along the way Will and I had a baby girl and have been raising her too. In my travels I have had the opportunity to interview masters of the trade (the late great John Prine, Richard Thompson, Lucinda Williams, and Steve Earle, to name a few) and am working on a new book now that compiles these. It dawned on me at some point that I was ready to write songs again and start touring. So I did. I assembled a great band (you know these guys: they play with Steve Earle, Bruce Springsteen, and Son Volt) and began to tour. And then the world shut down. </p>
<h3>Recording in Quarantine</h3>
<p>As soon as the pandemic hit, we experimented with a social-distancing version of recording to keep the wheels turning, each of us playing our instruments in our own living rooms-- Don Dixon producing from his home studio.  We now have a version of Marshall Crenshaw's beautiful song ""Somewhere Down the Line"" that became the inspiration for a charting record to benefit Cat's Cradle called <i>Cover Charge.</i> You can hear how it came out for yourself at <a href=""http://coverchargemusic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://coverchargemusic.com</a> and read about it in various media outlets, including Pitchfork: <a href=""https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-cover-charge-nc-artists-go-under-cover-to-benefit-cats-cradle/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-cover-charge-nc-artists-go-under-cover-to-benefit-cats-cradle/</a></p>
<p>The quarantine recording method worked so well that I am going to finish <i>Highways and Rocketships</i> the same way, with the same musicians, and with Don Dixon producing. Pandemic or no pandemic, <i>Highways and Rocketships</i> is coming, and now we know that we can make it sound beautiful for you. Contributors can expect a lot of fun perks. I am very excited to announce that Ken Stringfellow (of the Posies) and I have recorded as a duo. He's been covering my song ""Christmas"" for years and we do it together for a single available to my supporters.  So you'll have access to that through this campaign, to some beautiful t-shirts designed by the inimitable Jon Langford, and a lot more goodies. Then, in Spring 2021, you'll receive the finished EP, <i>Highways and Rocketships</i>, available digitally, on CD, and a limited run of vinyl.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funds raised here will pay for recording costs--production, mixing, musicians, mastering, and video--as well as CD and vinyl pressing.  In addition to supporting music when it has become harder to make, contributors are helping employ folks who work in the original gig economy. </p>
<p><u>Perks for you (be sure to click on them, to see all that comes with each)</u>: </p>
<p>* Exclusive track, duo of ""Christmas,"" by Florence Dore &amp; Ken Stringfellow (available here only)</p>
<p><i>* Highways and Rocketships,</i> CD &amp; vinyl</p>
<p>* Jon Langford designed t-shirts &amp; other merch</p>
<p>* VIP tickets to safe, outdoor record release party following social distance rules  </p>
<p>* Autographed copies of my book on rock and southern fiction, <i>Novel Sounds</i></p>
<p>* Autographed copies of my first record, <i>Perfect City  </i></p>
<p><i>All items aside from physical copies of Highways and Rocketships will ship early 2021.</i></p>
<p>If the campaign makes more than we need for expenses related to this record, we'll roll it over to the next record.</p>

<h3>A Place Tells a Story... </h3>
<p>As an artist, I strive to tell authentic, vulnerable and compelling stories that truly move people. </p>
<p>Hi, I’m Taylor Dahl, and I’m a singer-songwriter from Los Angeles. </p>
<p>I was born in Berkeley, CA and was raised by parents who loved Joni Mitchell, The Beatles and CSN&amp;Y.  I have always loved music and performing.  I began songwriting 7 years ago, after a major life change, and released my first album in the Spring of 2020.  <i>Spinnaker Street  (available on Spotify, iTunes, Bandcamp, YouTube etc.) </i>was very well-received.  This strange year of pandemic isolation and introspection has inspired me to continue with some creative momentum. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Plan</h3>
<p>I’m starting this campaign to raise the funds to record my 2nd album.  </p>
<p>The place?  San Felix, Colombia.... A quiet countryside, located an hour outside of Medellin. </p>
<p>The story?  The journey of an artist who travels to a foreign land to endeavor an immersive experience of recording an entire album in 2 weeks. </p>
<p>The songs?  Well, those will tell a story in and of themselves. (6 new songs)</p>
<p>The timeline?  November 15th-27th … over the course of 2 weeks. </p>
<p>My buddy Rob LaFond suggested I come to Colombia for 2 weeks to record my next album and I thought, ""That’s crazy… Or genius..."" </p>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need to raise $6000 to fund the project</li>
<li>This budget will cover the costs of the recording studio, mixing/mastering, videographer, hiring local musicians, distribution, travel accommodations, and $500 to directly fund Medellin AV Club's project <i>Legends of Medellin</i>.</li>
<li>I'm offering some awesome perks for your generous donations including... a copy of the new album, a copy of both albums (Spinnaker Street and the new album), t-shirts, signed copies of the album, a collection of special limited edition Taylor Dahl Music merch (designed and made in Colombia just for this project), behind the scenes video footage, and a personalized video from Taylor.</li>
<li>If we don't reach our entire goal, the funds will still go to the making of my next album.  There will still be awesome new music, it just may take a little longer to produce. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contributions will help make this project happen.  So much goes into the making of an album and ANY donations are greatly appreciated.  Production is much more affordable in Colombia and your contributions will also help support local Colombian musicians and videographers.  Additionally, your donations will directly support Rob’s amazing project, <i>Legends of Medellin</i>, a documentary series highlighting the different neighborhoods and culture of Colombia.  </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Obstacles</h3>
<p>You might be thinking, ""How is Taylor going to record an entire album in 2 weeks? This seems unrealistic"".   You can rest assured that my entire reason for this trip will be to record the acoustic album.  Life in Los Angeles is busy, and it always seems that I am juggling a dozen projects at the same time.  I feel confident that focusing and immersing myself into this singleness of purpose for 2 weeks will yield great results.  </p>
<p>You might also be thinking, ""Is this a good time to go to Colombia with all that is going on in the world?""  Sadly, the news paints a negative and fear driven portrayal of Colombia.  I've spoken to Rob, who lives in Medellin, and he has confirmed that it is relatively safe if you make good choices.  I'm fully vaccinated and Rob also confirmed that people in Colombia are still following Covid-19 safety protocols.  Of course, there is always the chance that this could change... in which case I would delay my trip until it is safe to travel or make a new plan for recording.  Regardless, the new album will be made.  It is dying to come out!</p>
<h3>Other ways you can help</h3>
<p>If you're unable to donate for any reason, don't fret.  There are other ways you can help. </p>
<p>Please consider sharing this campaign link with friends, colleagues and/or on social media.  Helping to get the word out is amazingly helpful!!  This is easy to do using the IndieGoGo share tools.  Let's make some noise!!</p>

We’re Alan and Stacey Schulman also known as  ""As Is” (<strong>A</strong>lan &amp; <strong>S</strong>tacey <strong>Is</strong>…) – a couple of dreamers who started out as one Guitarist,  and one Vocalist,  who accidentally met over the chord changes of ‘Somewhere Over the Rainbow’ back in 2005.  When the song ended,  we went… “OMG that was soooo musical.

With the right resources, we will be able to create a beautiful album and continue on our journey to connect with the heart of the world through music. </p><p>We thank you in advance for your support and for helping Heart to Heart from As Is become a reality.</p></div>","We’re As IsHi!

<h2>20 Years!</h2>
<p>Please join me for a very special project for 2020 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of my first album, Not The Tremblin' Kind. I have material ready to make an album, but I've been puzzling over how to properly celebrate this anniversary. Instead of a traditional album, I thought it would be exciting to record two songs with different producers and release them as virtual singles roughly every two months.  Basically, rather than putting out a 10- or 12-song album at one time, I’d like to offer a 5 to 6 ""singles"" over the course of the next few months to celebrate my 20-year career. We will then compile all the recordings at the end of the process into a full length album that will be available on CD. </p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The money I raise through this project will help pay for recording costs - studio time, producer fees and musicians. These funds will also cover the production of physical copies of the new album once all of the music is recorded.</p>
<p>Through your support, I will be able to record with several different producers and musicians in key music cities.</p>
<p>Everyone who supports the project will get immediate access to each ""two-sided"" single as they are finished.</p>
<p>If I can raise enough funds then we can press vinyl of the collected singles.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>For those of you who can't contribute, you can still help to get the word out and make some noise about my campaign. That would be a huge help! </p>
<p>Thanks, Laura </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Thank you for checking out our EP fundraising page! In the last year and a half we have recorded 3 singles, 2 of which charted at #2 on the Canadian iTunes inspirational charts. But it's time to dream bigger. We are so excited to have this opportunity to travel to Nashville, Tennessee and record our all new original EP with a Billboard charting producer. The songs on this EP will include Holy, The Reason, Power In The Name and more. These songs have had a huge impact on the local church here in Chilliwack, British Columbia, but these songs were never meant to be contained within the four walls of the church. They were meant to have a global impact, and that's what we are planning to do with the recording and networking opportunities we have in Nashville. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funds raised in this campaign will help fund travel expenses, studio rental fees, recording and engineering fees, producer fees as well as graphic design and marketing expenses. Any money raised beyond our goal will go towards videography projects and music videos to help promote the songs. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Upon completion, this EP will be marketed and made available for other churches to use as well as pitched to record labels and radio stations globally. The EP will range in variety and will include both praise and worship songs designed to bring hope to people and glory to God.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our biggest challenge will be travelling with some of the restrictions still in effect, but we believe God has a plan and are believing that everything will go smoothly.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>PRAY. Pray that God's will be done in the making and distribution of this EP, that the whole process would go smoothly from the beginning to the end and that the name of Jesus would be lifted all over the world through these songs.</p>

<h3><u><strong>My Story</strong></u></h3>
<p>Hello - I’m singer songwriter, Malachi Jaggers. A year ago I made a decision to go on this journey as an Americana musician. My wife and I experienced some devastating years before 2020. And borne out of those experiences, new songs, new hearts, and new outlooks emerged about us, about the world, and about our place in it. Armed with these songs aimed to heal, encourage, and entertain I made the decision to go on this journey as an Americana musician. The beginning of 2020 brought much excitement and renewed hope of good things to come. I booked the studio time, worked on pre-production with Producer and friend Matt Coles, and refined the songs. Then came February and the time at the studio with musicians and not just any musicians. Studio and touring musicians that I have long admired for their talents. It was a great day. A few more days doing vocal overdubs.. And then before we knew it we were heading home talking about how amazing it all was and how amazing it all will be. And then came shutdowns, lockdowns, isolation. It sounds depressing and devastating and indeed it was and is for many still. But how in awe we are that the recording was done just under the wire. And that soon, with your help these songs of encouragement and healing from devastation and heartbreak will be available for a world healing from just that- devastation and heartbreak. It seems to be perfectly timed for hearts that need the message. And we hope that is exactly where it lands- in open hearts ready for a new season, a new message, and a new song. And all it takes is is you. I can’t make this happen without your financial support. </p>

<h2>A Little About Me</h2>
<p>Hey! Thank you for coming to check out my Indiegogo Campaign! Like many professional touring musicians, this past year has given me an opportunity to take a breath, and to focus on writing new music and learning some new skills. With the songs written and recorded, I am here for my second time on Indiegogo to ask for your support in completing this album, and helping to promote it!</p>
<p>If you are new to my story and my music, here is a little more about me: <br/><br/>I was born in upstate New York, but raised in Northern California with parents who were big time believers in the Columbia House 20 CDs for $1 deals, so my musical background is a motley mess of everything from Joe Public to Diane Schuur. I started playing guitar at age 14, when I fell in love with Nirvana, the Doors, and Aerosmith. I picked up a paper route, and earned enough money for my first dream guitar, a Gibson SG.<br/><br/>I played in bands through high school and college (Good Question, 24/7, Harvest Red) and had a blast. It wasn't until I met a group of fellas in Chicago that I really saw what opportunities music could open up for me. Vintage Blue was our band. We played some big festivals, opened for some awesome artists, and threw ourselves into trying to ""make it"" as a working band in Chicago. In 2015, our band had the opportunity to meet music fans from around the world on The Rock Boat, a music-themed cruise, after winning a battle of the bands. Not long after that, the band split, and I tried to find a way to play music and also keep working 100 hour weeks as a lawyer. That did not last long. I decided to leave law when I released my first solo album, ""These Dreams"".<br/><br/>Since that release in 2016, I opened my life to an experience of performing on the road, and trying to make a living from my music. In a few short years I have played over 600 shows in 44 of the U.S. states, and 7 different countries. I have driven over 500,000 miles. I have opened for international superstars, and I have belted out songs to a lone bartender. </p>
<p>As all of us know, 2020 was a year unlike any that we have lived through. It was a time when the music truly stopped, along with many sports, spending time with friends, and a host of other things that used to be completely normal. 2020 also meant a financial strain on independent artists like myself. At times it made me wonder if I would still be able to pursue this journey. Luckily I was able to find my way through, thanks to support from many of you.</p>
<p>Now I am back, asking for you to come to my aid again, and help me bring a brand new batch of songs into the world!</p>
<h2>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>In 2018 I created my first Indiegogo Campaign. With your help, I was able to raise enough money to hire producers Kit Karlson, and Chip Johnson to help me craft six entirely new songs, and make them ready for radio and international distribution. During that last project I asked you to help me raise $15,000 and you all came through in a HUGE way. You all put me over that amount, and made my dream record a REALITY! I was able to complete the project on time, and the album received coverage from all over the world in print and digital magazines, and on terrestrial radio.</p>
<p>This time around, I am looking to raise $9,000.  The reason for the different goal amount from my previous record, is because I have done most of the studio engineering and mixing on my own. That saves a significant amount from the cost of making an album.</p>
<p>The funds will be used in the following way:</p>
<ul>

<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>As many of you know, I have a difficult time asking for help.

I will always admire the way he was able to do that.

<p>Your contribution allows me to bring new, thoughtful, and introspective songs into the world. If you know my songwriting, you know that I base my songs in real life experiences, and their impacts on people. These songs are no different.</p>
<p>If you know me and my merchandise, you also know that I will make sure you get high quality goods, that are comfortable and good lookin.</p>
<p>As a bonus, your support on this album, will likely mean more music in the future, since the cost of producing tunes myself is much less expensive.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The best part about this particular project, is that the risks regarding the music are minimal. 90% of the work is complete. Therefore, with the exception of some final mix advice, and mastering work, the music is ready ... unless more songs might be coming (HINT HINT .... )</p>
<ul><li>The biggest challenge may be production. 2020 has seen delays in production and delivery of nearly every good you can think of from hot tubs to time machines!

And either way, you will get the music on time!</li></ul>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I have made as many levels of contribution that I can feasibly make, but some of you may still not feel comfortable contributing at this point. That is OKAY! Here are some other ways that you can help me out!</p>
<ul>
<li>Share this campaign! Not just share the link, but tag a friend or let someone know why you follow me, and what you appreciate about my music.</li>

</div><p>And that's all there is to it.</p></div>","A Little About Me
Hey! Thank you for coming to check out my Indiegogo Campaign! Like many professional touring musicians, this past year has given me an opportunity to take a breath, and to focus on writing new music and learning some new skills. With the songs written and recorded, I am here for my second time on Indiegogo to ask for your support in completing this album, and helping to promote it!
If you are new to my story and my music, here is a little more about me: I was born in upstate New York, but raised in Northern California with parents who were big time believers in the Columbia House 20 CDs for $1 deals, so my musical background is a motley mess of everything from Joe Public to Diane Schuur. I started playing guitar at age 14, when I fell in love with Nirvana, the Doors, and Aerosmith. I picked up a paper route, and earned enough money for my first dream guitar, a Gibson SG.I played in bands through high school and college (Good Question, 24/7, Harvest Red) and had a blast. It wasn't until I met a group of fellas in Chicago that I really saw what opportunities music could open up for me. Vintage Blue was our band. We played some big festivals, opened for some awesome artists, and threw ourselves into trying to ""make it"" as a working band in Chicago. In 2015, our band had the opportunity to meet music fans from around the world on The Rock Boat, a music-themed cruise, after winning a battle of the bands. Not long after that, the band split, and I tried to find a way to play music and also keep working 100 hour weeks as a lawyer. That did not last long. I decided to leave law when I released my first solo album, ""These Dreams"".Since that release in 2016, I opened my life to an experience of performing on the road, and trying to make a living from my music. In a few short years I have played over 600 shows in 44 of the U.S. states, and 7 different countries. I have driven over 500,000 miles. I have opened for international superstars, and I have belted out songs to a lone bartender. 
As all of us know, 2020 was a year unlike any that we have lived through. It was a time when the music truly stopped, along with many sports, spending time with friends, and a host of other things that used to be completely normal. 2020 also meant a financial strain on independent artists like myself. At times it made me wonder if I would still be able to pursue this journey. Luckily I was able to find my way through, thanks to support from many of you.
Now I am back, asking for you to come to my aid again, and help me bring a brand new batch of songs into the world!
What I Need & What You Get
In 2018 I created my first Indiegogo Campaign. With your help, I was able to raise enough money to hire producers Kit Karlson, and Chip Johnson to help me craft six entirely new songs, and make them ready for radio and international distribution. During that last project I asked you to help me raise $15,000 and you all came through in a HUGE way. You all put me over that amount, and made my dream record a REALITY! I was able to complete the project on time, and the album received coverage from all over the world in print and digital magazines, and on terrestrial radio.
This time around, I am looking to raise $9,000.  The reason for the different goal amount from my previous record, is because I have done most of the studio engineering and mixing on my own. That saves a significant amount from the cost of making an album.
The funds will be used in the following way:

$2,500 for Album Completion, Artwork, & Mastering
$2,500 for Press, Promotion, Playlisting, and Advertising Fees
$1,250 for Physical Album Production
$2,000 for Merchandise Production & Shipping
$750 Fees collected by Indiegogo & CC Fees

In return for your contribution I have a collection of goods ready for you to grab up! I have entirely brand new and EXCLUSIVE goods for Indiegogo backers, including sweatshirts, long sleeve tees, t-shirts, a mug, pint glasses, shot glasses, sunglasses, and all sorts of other goodies! I am really REALLY stoked about the new logo, and my first full color designs on all these goods!

<h3>Dawn? Tell us more...</h3>
<p>Can you believe it?...our 6th CD! And once again, it'll be a full-length album! This time though it's not just a compilation of random songs that we've pulled together. This time the songs tell a story, a timeline, an album about experiences / challenges / successes that have led Betsy along her musical journey and the tremendous impact each experience had on her life. From the tragedy of losing her mother (Dawn) from cancer when Betsy was just 9 years old to the amazing person she is today.</p>
<p>Instead of releasing a full album all at once, we're releasing each single individually and then ultimately compiling them all on a single album when the 9th single is set to be released. Starting August 27th, we'll be releasing the first single ""Forever"" followed by another single every 4 - 5 weeks. Each song will guide you along this courageous and exciting journey of Betsy's.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Reality of Producing an Album</h3>
<p>As all of you undoubtedly know, creating music that can stream on platforms like iTunes, Spotify, YouTube, and many other streaming sites, costs a tremendous amount of money. The costs associated with recording, editing, publishing, marketing, artwork, physical albums, merchandise, subscriptions, licenses, professional assistance, social media, and more, can cost tens of thousands of dollars. For the world's most well-known artists...even millions. We truly need your help to reach our goal of raising $30,000 for the creation of this album, and in return we want to share along the way. </p>
<p>We have created a number of 'perks' (listed to the right) that require a certain level of financial contribution, HOWEVER, will in return give you a gift, or many gifts, helping us to ultimately reach our financial goal. How will the $30,000 be spent? </p>
<ul>
<li>$16,000 - Recording, Editing, Mixing &amp; Mastering</li>
<li>$6500 - Merchandise</li>
<li>$4000 - Videos and Multi-Media Needs</li>
<li>$2500 - Promotional Efforts</li>
<li>$550 - Various Licenses and Subscriptions</li>
<li>$450 - Artwork and Photography</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other miscellaneous expenses, but your generosity will help us cover the amounts listed above. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Creative Team</h3>
<p>While the following is a list of individuals directly involved with the creation of this album, there are SO many others (too many to list) that make this all possible. We can never fully express our gratitude with simple words. Those directly involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>Betsy Ade:  Vocals, Ukulele, Songwriter, Lyricist, Co-Producer, Artwork, Story</li>
<li>Joe Adamek:  Guitars, Piano, Keyboards, Percussion, Songwriter, Producer, Artwork, Campaign Manager</li>
<li>Cameron Fair:  Cello, Piano, Keyboards, Songwriter, Arrangement</li>
<li>John Kulas:  Bass Guitar, Arrangement</li>

<h3>Other Ways to Help</h3>
<p>We understand that some of our fans simply can't afford to contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help! Here's ways to help us get this story out to others:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make noise about this campaign! Share the link! (Use the Indiegogo share tools!)</li>
<li>Get the word out on this album! As our singles are released, point others to the songs!</li>
<li>Tell music magazines/websites/blogs/other relevant avenues about this project.</li>
<li>Post info about this project on social media! </li>
<li>Email your friends and family around the world (this system works the best)</li>
<li>Tell your friends directly (old school style.... offline).</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>A Few Challenges</h3>
<p>Since we're releasing each single individually, one after the other, the final singles (9th and 10th songs and the full album), won't come out until April 8, 2022. This means that while financial contributions will be needed now, some of the gifts may not come until 2nd quarter of 2022. Other gifts, like the digital download of each single, will be delivered ahead of each single release. </p>
<p>Also, please know that regardless of the amount that the fundraising campaign will generate, we are fully committed to using all the amount raised for this album. If we exceed our target goal, we'll be armed with additional funds to do more with things like promotion, video, and social media. If we don't reach the funding goal, we will still get the album out, but we would have to adjust the amount of money spent on various elements.</p>

<h3>What Moxie are all about </h3>
<p>Hi! We are Moxie, an Alt Folk band from Ireland.  We released our debut album 'Planted' in 2014 and toured our music in Australia, Vietnam and countries across Europe. Our travels and performances have allowed us to share our culture and enable us to learn about the music of the world we live in today. Since then we have grown as professional musicians and released two EP's. Learning new instruments and skills has enabled us to shape our current sound. We're excited for you to hear it.  </p>
<p>This new record will convey the progression of our sound through our travels and experiences with different cultures and people. It features a blend of electric and acoustic instruments with the music showcasing a variety of genres. Our compositions are also influenced by the musicians from the past and present who inspire us, enabling the band to maintain a distinct and original sound.</p>
<p>Meeting and collaborating with singer/songwriter Julia Spanu has allowed us to explore the power of song.  Julia, who has roots in Tunisia, France, Italy and Vietnam will feature on this record. She has a vast understanding of traditional folk songs. This, mixed with our innovative take on Irish music has created a unique style that we are super excited to share with you.</p>
<p>We hope that you will join us on this journey to producing and recording our new record!</p>
<p>Moxie includes Sligo brothers Jos Kelly (button accordion/keyboards/bass-synth) &amp; Ted Kelly (tenor banjo/electric tenor guitar/sampler), Limerick natives Darren Roche (button accordion/glockenspiel/bodhrán), &amp; Cillian Doheny (tenor banjo/guitar/electric guitar) as well as Cork native Josh Sampson (drums/percussion).</p>
<p>This record will also feature guest musicians such as French violinist Jean-Christophe Morel and Irish guitarist Richie Delahunty.</p>
<p>We've had the pleasure to work on this new album with recording engineer, Alex Borwick in Camden Studios, Dublin. </p>
<p>We are also delighted that Jake Birch will be producing the album. We've worked with Jake in the past and found his approach to our music to be meticulously innovative. </p>

I grew up in Lagos, Nigeria and even though I wasn't born into a musical family, I was born into a musical culture.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Welcome to our campaign! We are Brasuka:  6 musicians, representing 5 different cultures, singing in 3 languages (Portuguese, English, and Spanish), all sharing a love of Brazilian music. Reminiscent of artists like Sergio Mendes and Ivan Lins, we enjoy big productions with lots of percussion, beautiful harmonies, and a variety of grooves and emotions. We write and arrange our music together in a way that represents our cultural diversity as well as our Brazilian inspiration. We are excited to finally be releasing our debut album. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Album</h3>
<p>The album is titled <i>A Vida Com Paixão</i>, which means A Life with Passion, and it includes almost all original music.  There's a little something for everyone: from exciting rhythms like Brazilian samba and frevo, to groovy beats like samba reggae and maracatu to tender ballads. It is diverse world music influenced heavily by Brazilian percussion and American jazz.  We have worked hard to create something joyful, welcoming, and beautiful, telling lots of different stories. We hope to share this music far and wide, and we would deeply appreciate your support. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Campaign</h3>
<p>To help us achieve our goals, which include CD manufacturing, video production, publicity, radio promotion, album artwork and website design, we have launched this fundraising campaign. We are offering several fun donation perks, or you could simply click the ""back it"" button and donate without receiving a perk. We are hoping to raise $15,000 through this endeavor. </p>
<p>We have many items and experiences available as perks. Choose from things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Digital download or signed CD</li>
<li>Entry to our online Brazilian percussion workshop</li>
<li>Leadsheets for all 10 songs on the album</li>
<li>Custom-made auxiliary percussion instrument </li>
<li>Private lesson, clinic, or masterclass</li>
<li>House concert</li>
<li>Executive producer and ""the works"" package</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>It helps us greatly when you share this campaign and help us get the word out.  These campaigns can be very successful and can make a huge difference to what is possible for this music and this band. Thank you so much for your support!</p>

</div></div>","Overview
Welcome to our campaign! We are Brasuka:  6 musicians, representing 5 different cultures, singing in 3 languages (Portuguese, English, and Spanish), all sharing a love of Brazilian music. Reminiscent of artists like Sergio Mendes and Ivan Lins, we enjoy big productions with lots of percussion, beautiful harmonies, and a variety of grooves and emotions. We write and arrange our music together in a way that represents our cultural diversity as well as our Brazilian inspiration. We are excited to finally be releasing our debut album. 
 
The Album
The album is titled A Vida Com Paixão, which means A Life with Passion, and it includes almost all original music.  There's a little something for everyone: from exciting rhythms like Brazilian samba and frevo, to groovy beats like samba reggae and maracatu to tender ballads. It is diverse world music influenced heavily by Brazilian percussion and American jazz.  We have worked hard to create something joyful, welcoming, and beautiful, telling lots of different stories. We hope to share this music far and wide, and we would deeply appreciate your support. 
 

The Campaign
To help us achieve our goals, which include CD manufacturing, video production, publicity, radio promotion, album artwork and website design, we have launched this fundraising campaign. We are offering several fun donation perks, or you could simply click the ""back it"" button and donate without receiving a perk. We are hoping to raise $15,000 through this endeavor. 
We have many items and experiences available as perks. Choose from things like:

Digital download or signed CD
Entry to our online Brazilian percussion workshop
Leadsheets for all 10 songs on the album
Custom-made auxiliary percussion instrument 
Private lesson, clinic, or masterclass
House concert
Executive producer and ""the works"" package

 

Other Ways You Can Help
It helps us greatly when you share this campaign and help us get the word out.  These campaigns can be very successful and can make a huge difference to what is possible for this music and this band. Thank you so much for your support!

<h2>Funding the Recording of ""Buzz of Bees""</h2>
<h3>Let's Make an Amazing New Album Together!</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Hello!  This is Stephen Evans of <a href=""http://stephenevanmusic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Stephen Evans &amp; the True Grits</strong></a>, and I would like to invite you to help us record our new album ""<strong>Buzz of Bees</strong>"".</p>
<p>Me &amp; the True Grits (Brian Shoemaker - guitar, bass, and vocals, Sam Hess - drums, and Woodstock - mandolin) hail from Asheville, NC and have been together for about 7 years now playing shows and releasing a couple records along the way.  Our debut LP<strong> <a href=""https://stephenevans.bandcamp.com/album/something-to-bleed"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Something to Bleed""</a></strong>, funded through Kickstarter, was released in 2015 to much praise and radio play locally.  And our EP<strong> <a href=""https://stephenevans.bandcamp.com/album/under-the-bridge"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Under the Bridge""</a></strong> came out in 2017 to some wonderful local attention as well.  Both of those records were recorded on our on a small Tascam Portable Digital Recorder that we dubbed ""The Precious"", so we have only recorded and mixed on our own before. </p>
<p>But with this new album, which I have named ""<strong>Buzz of Bees</strong>"" after one of the tracks, we are looking to step it way up by getting it professionally recorded, produced, mixed, mastered and manufactured before sending it out to the world.  This is a group of songs that the band and I are very excited and proud to share; so we really want to make this the best quality possible to do these songs justice.  And with that strong desire comes an elevated budget unfortunately.  That's where our supporters come in to help us make it a reality to make something beautiful that can bring a whole lot of listeners some joy.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So this is what we need from our supporters to reach our budget goal for this project:</p>
<p>The recording studio time cost - $2000</p>
<p>Studio musicians cost - $1000</p>
<p>Producer - $3,000</p>
<p>Mixing &amp; Mastering - $4000</p>

<p><u>Manufacturing 200 Vinyl &amp; 100 CDs - $2500</u></p>
<p><u>Subtotal = $13,000</u></p>
<p>Minus what I will be raising on my own - $5000</p>
<p><strong>Total goal is $8000</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here are some <strong>unique perks</strong> that are available for supporters:</p>
<p>- Your name listed on the album credits!!  Every contributor of $10 or more will be listed on the album credits with the larger contributors getting the larger name size printed.  </p>
<p>- Home shows!  I will come or the whole band will come to your house at your invitation to play a 2-hour show for you!</p>
<p>- Online shows!  I will play a personal online show for you and your friends!</p>
<p>- A signed vinyl or CD copy of the new album!</p>
<p>-  True Grits T-shirts &amp; stickers!</p>
<p>- Signed vinyl &amp; CDs of the past 2 records!</p>
<p>- and much more!</p>
<p>If for some reason we don't reach our goal, the funds will still be put toward the new record, but the budget will be reduced to match what we have received.  Hopefully that will not be the case, and we will be able to make the stellar album we want to make!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution, no matter the amount, will be so very important to the success of getting the new album made well and delivered to the masses.  If you love melodic folk rock with lyrics that are creative and meaningful, as well as tunes that are fun and make you bounce in your seat, you will be helping bring that style of music to life.</p>
<p>Like I said before, our debut album ""Something to Bleed"" was brought to life with the help of a Kickstarter campaign back in 2015.  With that success, a music career was reborn with the band, Stephen Evans &amp; the True Grits.  Because it was pretty well done with the help of supporters, songs from it were played on a few radio stations, sold to fans of the music and successfully delivered to wanting ears.</p>
<p>You too can help bring ""Buzz of Bees"" to life as our greatest project yet!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I've always been someone that survives and overcomes challenges, and things always do come up.  But I've already released two records, so I am prepared to take on anything that may occur.  </p>
<p>- If the budget somehow has to be lowered due to a lower contribution total, I will do my best to adjust to that change so we can get the album out to the people who want it.</p>
<p>- If there is a delay in release for any reason, I will communicate with everyone and share the adjusted timeline as soon as I know.</p>
<p>- If certain musicians become unavailable to record for some reason, with the connections I have developed over the years in the music scene in Asheville, I should be able to find a suitable and timely replacement</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>A great way to help is to spread the word about the project any way you can either by word of mouth, social media, email forwarding, directing people to the past music releases, etc.  </div><p>And that's all there is to it.</p></div>","Funding the Recording of ""Buzz of Bees""

<h3>Where it all started...</h3>
<p>My journey in music began as a two year old watching my father rehearse with his singing group in our living room. I remember the way the harmonies sounded and can still faintly smell the scent of the different colognes the guys wore. I never saw any band not even my own years later that would be so well dressed for practice. LOL! Nevertheless, before I knew it I was bitten by the bug and wanted to become a singer like my dad. I eventually taught myself how to play multiple instruments, write songs, arrange and produce them.  Hard to believe its been 30 years since I started recording. </p>
<p>In 2007, I released my first album ""Love &amp; Faith: Volume 1"" which did really well and in 2013 released my sophomore project ""A Wonderful Love: Love &amp; Faith Volume 2"". Both projects were regarded as being one of the best R&amp;B / Soul albums in Japan which helped establish me internationally as an independent recording artist. My second album even made it to #2 on the UK Soul Chart! Music has allowed me to play around the world and share stages with many of my musical heroes. There's no greater feeling than sharing your gift and bringing joy to people along the way.</p>
<p>This summer I will be releasing my third album titled ""RIVER"" which is a collection of songs I've written over the past 6 years. I am a lover and student of classic R&amp;B music and this project is full of songs reminiscent of what I love about the genre. Great stories and strong melodies have always been a hallmark of my tunes and this project is no exception. My first 2 projects were funded out of pocket with little to no outside investment. A labor of love indeed but this time around I felt it would be a great opportunity to include you all, the music lovers into the process.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Funding &amp; Incentives</h3>
<p>I've completed all the recording and production work so the songs are ready to go. This final phase is where you come in.

My journey in music began as a two year old watching my father rehearse with his singing group in our living room. I remember the way the harmonies sounded and can still faintly smell the scent of the different colognes the guys wore. I never saw any band not even my own years later that would be so well dressed for practice. LOL! Nevertheless, before I knew it I was bitten by the bug and wanted to become a singer like my dad. I eventually taught myself how to play multiple instruments, write songs, arrange and produce them.  Hard to believe its been 30 years since I started recording. 
In 2007, I released my first album ""Love & Faith: Volume 1"" which did really well and in 2013 released my sophomore project ""A Wonderful Love: Love & Faith Volume 2"". Both projects were regarded as being one of the best R&B / Soul albums in Japan which helped establish me internationally as an independent recording artist. My second album even made it to #2 on the UK Soul Chart! Music has allowed me to play around the world and share stages with many of my musical heroes. There's no greater feeling than sharing your gift and bringing joy to people along the way.
This summer I will be releasing my third album titled ""RIVER"" which is a collection of songs I've written over the past 6 years. I am a lover and student of classic R&B music and this project is full of songs reminiscent of what I love about the genre. Great stories and strong melodies have always been a hallmark of my tunes and this project is no exception. My first 2 projects were funded out of pocket with little to no outside investment. A labor of love indeed but this time around I felt it would be a great opportunity to include you all, the music lovers into the process.  

Funding & Incentives
I've completed all the recording and production work so the songs are ready to go. This final phase is where you come in. I am hoping to raise funds to replicate the album for CD format,  vinyl pressing as well as for marketing and radio promotion. It has been a lifelong dream of mine to have my music pressed onto a record and with your help I will finally be able to achieve it. 
My goal is to raise $6,000.00 which will cover the costs towards getting the album ready for retail and to promote it. I anticipate this to be my biggest release yet and I want to give it the best launch possible. Rest assured that every penny will go towards doing just that.

<p><font><span style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;"">I have been writing and recording music for over 10 years, and I am entering my fourth year making songs with Rich Boy Junkie. As RBJ, I have digitally released three full-length albums and two EPs, but have never had the chance to release any of these songs through a physical medium. Printing vinyl records (along with other costs associated with proper promotion of a music release) is a costly process and usually requires large production quantities, making it challenging for independent artists like myself to bank roll a project like this with no financial support or guaranteed sales. As a result, I'm asking my supporters to help me fund this next step with my upcoming release.</span></font></p>

<h3>What Exactly Am I Asking For (and What Do You Get in Return)?</h3>
</div><div>
<p>My intent is to provide as much as I can in return for your contribution. I don't want people to think of this as me just asking for your money, but instead as a pre-order, a credited contribution, or an investment in one of the most significant creative projects I feel I've worked on.</p>
<p>As noted above, the majority of the money raised through this campaign will go towards production costs of the first physical Rich Boy Junkie release. The album will be pressed on vinyl through Furnace Record Pressing, an industry leader that has a long history of high quality products and independent ownership. The costs associated can fluctuate, but a minimum order will cost around $3,000. Any additional funds raised give me the potential for wiggle room to press more records or increase the quality (like pressing more durable records, including inserts, etc.) </p>
<p>Anyone who contributes $10 or more to this campaign gets a record shipped to them after the album is released. If you're on the fence, this is the cheapest this album will be available for. Again, I want to do my best to make sure you feel there is a legitimate incentive for a small contribution. If you contribute $1 or more, you get it digitally on the release date. Every donation helps, and therefore will be rewarded. One buck for a digital album? What a steal!</p>
<p>Obviously, the more you contribute the more you can get. Consult the perks section for a full list. And please understand, I am not perfect and sometimes I can miss out on a million dollar idea.

<h3>What is <i>Have Fun in the Sky</i>?</h3>
<p>The simple answer is that <i>Have Fun in the Sky</i> is the upcoming fourth album by Rich Boy Junkie. The medium answer is that it's a piece of work I've become incredibly invested in and proud of, and one that I'm confident enough to say is some of my favorite and best work. People who know me know that I don't take calling something I've worked on 'good' very lightly. But, damn, I think this record is pretty friggin good.</p>
<p>Long answer? As did most creatives, I took the start of the Covid-19 lockdowns as an opportunity to work on something new. I'm lucky enough to have a network of loved ones that have become close creative partners since March, and those people have helped me turn this into one of the most collaborative projects I've ever worked on. Through a network of home studios and professional facilities, we've been able to come together virtually (thank you, Google Drive) and safely to fine tune this project. It's something I am proud to call ours and excited to make yours. It's something that Rich Boy Junkie has never sounded like, but hopefully an opening to usher in a new process and potential for this project.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>It always feels kind of silly to harp on, but following Rich Boy Junkie on your favorite social media sites and streaming services is always helpful. Seriously, clicking that little follow button on Spotify makes a gigantic difference for artists and is free to do. Even more helpful is sharing your favorite songs with your friends, sharing this campaign, and spreading the word about what this project means for you. I've always viewed music as a spiritual difference maker, and I would be honored to know if I can offer that impact to others.</p>

Any money we raise beyond this goal will go either to this album or to support future Rising Song artists in making new Jewish music.

<p> </p>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Who am I // Where I come from</span></h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Aly Halpert. I’m a Jewish musician, educator, and activist. I’m a lover of endless harmonies, writing songs about serious and seriously silly things, and being in life with people. I grew up in Ann Arbor, MI and live now on Schaghticoke/Mohican land in rural Millerton, NY. </p>
<p>I am who I am as a person and young adult musician because of many of you. My songs have grown out of grief, closeness, hope, and love, but always in relationship to community -- Jewish leftist community, Jewish song and camp community, queer community, local organizing-against-power-plants community, and the family and friends I call home. </p>
<p>Over the last few years I’ve found myself surprised and thrilled to be supported to do what makes me feel most alive, which is to create. I’ve been deepening into my music practice and taking more risks (yikes!). This includes the project of bringing these songs to life in the form of an album -- so you can have them, and so they can reach more people who could use them.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Why this album?</span></h3>
<p>This music draws from Jewish traditions, liturgy, and practice, and is grounded in visions of social justice. Most fundamentally, the songs on this album are about healing, imagining the world to come, or both. How do we transform a society that destroys life to one that cherishes life? How do we hold our personal healing amidst so much collective grief? How do we continue to celebrate all that we are and the resilient life around us? We matter so much and we know it so little. This music is about that -- our humanity, and what is possible when we can tell we have each other. </p>
<p>Music has always been at the forefront of social movements. Song breaks us open, heals us, helps us to dream and to be ourselves. This album is for you, in service of us winning the world we want together. They are for singing in movement spaces, song circles, synagogues, in nature, or quietly to yourself when you need it.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where you come in!</h3>
<p>Making this album is a years-long dream come true. I am beyond honored to do this with a team of brilliant, clear-eyed, and good people, and this project will take a lot of work and care. It feels scary to ask for collective support for music, especially in the form of $18,000! This number is actually an attempt to value the time, energy, and gifts of a number of musicians, artists, and engineers. In this way, fundraising accomplishes more than just making this album -- it supports artists to continue doing the cultural work we so deeply need.</p>
<p> </p>

This album could be regarded as the answer to a person, who would claim that they are free from religion, by saying that in our modern lives we’re not at all free from religion; our dependence is only disguised. Let me explain: I have observed so many things in life that have vast religious aspects, that somewhat connect to ancient gods. For example the excessive fitness trend has somewhat transcending promises, requires a regular attendance at the gym (like a temple), dietary restrictions (like plenty of religions do), incorporates somewhat clerical instructions by fitness coaches, and there’s even very preachy sounding motivational speakers and podcasters pushing you to your limits. People are somewhat still worshipping “Adonis”, the greek god of bodily beauty. And so the album follows eight different phenomena/gods in eight different songs.</p><p>Besides writing a theological paper on the concept behind the album, and incorporating the songwriting process in a graded project at my university, I also got really good feeback from fellow musicians early on. I believe that this record, even more than the last one, will have an impact on the listeners and will be more than just another piece of music in people's libraries, but rather a cherished meaningful narrative experience in musical form. It will not be a hit-worthy, short-lived, trendy ablum, but an aged, complex, and deep record. I'd like to compare it to a good whiskey. Rough, tough, and really freakin good.</p><p><strong>The sounds</strong>: As I stick to my roots of incorporating exotic sounds, I'll go another step further and refine the musical vision of Theoptia. It will be more harmonically dense, have multiple guitars, less synths, and a good amount of odd-meters whilst providing groove like not yet before. I wish and hope to have some sort of small scale success with this album. I would like to gain more recognition as an artist and be able to be found on the map of today's metal more easily. This time I really think this record will take me a considerable step forward as an artist. I would be so glad to have you support me in that!</p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>The biggest challenge for me is probably to deliver on time. The process so far has been very time consuming; more than I could have anticipated. Right now I'm thinking that we'll be done with the project and releasing the music by March 2021, but I'm hesitant saying that, knowing a dozen things could delay it. I'm studying in my last year of my Bachelors, which means a whole set of expectations to meet that might take my attention, energy, and time away from this project. But don't worry, I will make this happen! The question is only how quickly...</p><p>Then there's another risk that I might have underbudgeted a little with it. I hope that there's not too many unforeseen expenses that affect the project. Bear in mind that most of the budget layed out above are estimates; that might change.</p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Some people just can't contribute, and that is totally ok!

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Music for sinners who</h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">need a little soul</h2>
<p>I'm Caleb Lawson (recording as Brother John &amp; The Lonely Roads), and this was my first music recording project. It's just a few of the songs I’ve written over the past ten years since leaving home and losing my faith. These songs are me at my most vulnerable: they’re songs about me as a queer man, songs about love and fear, songs about hope and faith, and how sometimes they all feel the same. This little record is called <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/album/68uzbuhh27R223KxfUtSD7?si=ZnJUK92HTO-WECaqnMEi0A"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A Different Gospel</a>, and it’s for people like me (and maybe like you) who’ve had to go their own way and find their own gospel.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><i>What I Need &amp; What You Get</i></h3>
<p>I’ve worked with some outstanding talent on this project: the artist who painted the album cover, the bluegrass banjo player whose skill far outshines mine, the guitar player that make these songs rock, the pedal steel player whose twang makes the songs sound country as hell, the background vocalists who added depth and power to my songs, the audio engineers who made this sound like a real damn record, and so many others.</p>
<p><strong>I want to make you a part of this record, too. I'm asking you to contribute to this campaign to pay for CD duplication, so we can all have a real thing to hold and listen to.</strong></p>
<p>My base goal is $300 dollars for just the cost of CD duplication, with stretch goals that would help me put more of my music into the world. Indiegogo requires a minimum of $500 listed as the goal, but this campaign is set to Flexible Goal, so I will receive everything you contribute even if that required minimum isn't met.</p>
<h3><i><strong>Campaign Goals:</strong></i></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Base Goal:</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<strong>$300</strong>: CD duplication through DiscMakers.</li></ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Stretch Goals:</strong></p>

<li><p><strong>$500</strong>: Starter camera and basic lighting setup for cover songs and other social media content (brand and model to be determined).</p></li>

<h3><i>The Impact</i></h3>
<p>This record is important to me because I love music, because I love telling stories, and because sometimes, a song can save your soul.  Additionally, 40% of all streaming and album sales revenue will be donated to the Color Me Country Artist Grand Fund, so just by streaming my music you'll be contributing! This campaign is so that I can have physical CDs to offer when I play out, for social media giveaways, to send out to indie radio stations to shoot for some radio time, and, most of all, so we all can have something to have and to hold.</p>

<h3><i>Risks &amp; Challenges</i></h3>
<p>There's no risk to you in donating.

<h2>MY STORY</h2>
<p>A wise man once said, “There are only two great days in a person’s life -- the day we are born and the day we find out why”. Firmly convinced in my early twenties that I had found the “Why” of my birth as a film producer, I co-founded SRO Entertainment in Germany, the creative supplier for a German film fund. As a result, my company financed and helped produce films directed by Academy Award winners such as Robert Altman (”Company”), Barbara Kopple (”Havoc”), and Robert Towne (”Ask The Dust”), featuring stars the likes of Debra Winger, Donald Sutherland, Zooey Deschanel, Anne Hathaway, Colin Farrell and Selma Hayek.</p>
<p>By 2004, solidly on the path to a successful career in the movie industry, my future plans took an abrupt turn during the shooting of “Ask The Dust” in South Africa, when I went into labor with my first child. A blessed event — eye witnessed no less by Colin Farrell -- one of the stars of the film, which I co-produced with Tom Cruise.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_640/v1602607731/v2zwmm0eyi0eexatfkhi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As a consequence, my early years of motherhood left little time for traveling the world in film production.  Especially  after my daughter's arrival was followed by the birth of my eldest son, and  then his identical twin brothers.  One and all the loves of my life, and the inspiration for my song, ""Children To Raise"", my launch as a singer/songwriter.  An homage to all women struggling between motherhood, and achieving their personal dreams — triggered by my first born's less than subtle suggestion that I forsake my song writing aspirations and ""get a real job!""  One that makes money!""</p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/FWxY9Z9tesM?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>For me, being able to compose, perform, and make a video of ""Children to Raise"" — while actually doing exactly that — was validation that even when the day comes that the role of a woman's womb is over in this lifetime, her ability to create will still be able to bear\other gifts.  Not just as a musician, or in the arts, but in whatever dream they wish to pursue.  A lesson that no amount of money can buy; an example to pass on to her children and hopefully another nail in the coffin that dictates that women must choose between motherhood and a career.  A daunting task that once chosen, will not only make women stronger, but imbue them with a gift of sight that can only be seen <i>through the maternal lens</i>.  A superpower open to all women, and the title of my new Album.  </p>
<p><strong>A journey to find the connection between personal development of the soul and the concrete results we hope to achieve in this lifetime. The stories and dreams -- the struggles and rewards -- in hindsight and foresight, as I now see them, through the maternal lens.</strong></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Through The Maternal Lens</h3>
<p>The Album I am now asking for your help to produce, at a time when I believe the universe is calling for me to create something meaningful -- not just from the heart, but through the gift of sight I now see the world through. A vision that inspired and empowered me to write over 25 songs this past July. A quest I was only able to achieve by digging deep into my soul to find the authenticity within myself.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Use Of Funds</h3>
<p>The money contributed will be used to produce the highest quality full length Album, with a minimum of 11 songs -- at a price far below what would be considered an industry norm.  The funds will be allocated towards the studio costs, recording, mastering, producer's fees, engineering, back up vocals, and hiring musicians. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Making &amp; Exceeding My Goals</h3>
<p>If I can reach my goal, I’ll be able to produce, master, and release the album “Through The Maternal Lens!” And you will get it before anyone else.  In addition, because of my relationships in the film industry, I will be able to make a music video of one of the songs at no additional costs.</p>
<p>If we exceed the goal, I’ll not only be able to do more with the marketing and promotion of the album, but I will make more music videos. The choice of the first video to make I will decide after getting feedback from all of the donors who made it possible.</p>
<p>Most important of all, I just want others to be able to hear these songs, and these recordings. My goal is to inspire, as much as it is to create and produce.</p>
<h3>Risks And Challenges</h3>
<p>The lyrics and melodies for most of the songs are already in my head. The first of the songs has already been recorded. As for the remaining elements, I have relationships with seasoned professionals, such as Adam Peri, a brilliant producer/musician with a proven track record for delivering the highest quality results. </p>
<p>Of course any delays that might be caused by COVID-19, will only effect delivery date, not completion of the album.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I'm totally aware that this is not the best of times to ask anyone for financial help.  The strains that COVID has placed on us all makes survival the order of the day.  So I totally understand if you can't chip in for the cost of the album.  That said, if you still feel an urge to help, just make some noise about my campaign.  Spread the word on Indiegogo, Facebook, Twitter, by mouth, e-mail or carrier pigeon.  Anything you can do to help me get this album out, will be greatly appreciated.</p>

As a consequence, my early years of motherhood left little time for traveling the world in film production.  Especially  after my daughter's arrival was followed by the birth of my eldest son, and  then his identical twin brothers.  One and all the loves of my life, and the inspiration for my song, ""Children To Raise"", my launch as a singer/songwriter.  An homage to all women struggling between motherhood, and achieving their personal dreams — triggered by my first born's less than subtle suggestion that I forsake my song writing aspirations and ""get a real job!""  One that makes money!""

For me, being able to compose, perform, and make a video of ""Children to Raise"" — while actually doing exactly that — was validation that even when the day comes that the role of a woman's womb is over in this lifetime, her ability to create will still be able to bear\other gifts.  Not just as a musician, or in the arts, but in whatever dream they wish to pursue.  A lesson that no amount of money can buy; an example to pass on to her children and hopefully another nail in the coffin that dictates that women must choose between motherhood and a career.  A daunting task that once chosen, will not only make women stronger, but imbue them with a gift of sight that can only be seen through the maternal lens.  A superpower open to all women, and the title of my new Album.  
A journey to find the connection between personal development of the soul and the concrete results we hope to achieve in this lifetime. The stories and dreams -- the struggles and rewards -- in hindsight and foresight, as I now see them, through the maternal lens.
 
Through The Maternal Lens
The Album I am now asking for your help to produce, at a time when I believe the universe is calling for me to create something meaningful -- not just from the heart, but through the gift of sight I now see the world through. A vision that inspired and empowered me to write over 25 songs this past July. A quest I was only able to achieve by digging deep into my soul to find the authenticity within myself.
 
Use Of Funds
The money contributed will be used to produce the highest quality full length Album, with a minimum of 11 songs -- at a price far below what would be considered an industry norm.  The funds will be allocated towards the studio costs, recording, mastering, producer's fees, engineering, back up vocals, and hiring musicians. 
 
Making & Exceeding My Goals
If I can reach my goal, I’ll be able to produce, master, and release the album “Through The Maternal Lens!” And you will get it before anyone else.  In addition, because of my relationships in the film industry, I will be able to make a music video of one of the songs at no additional costs.
If we exceed the goal, I’ll not only be able to do more with the marketing and promotion of the album, but I will make more music videos. The choice of the first video to make I will decide after getting feedback from all of the donors who made it possible.
Most important of all, I just want others to be able to hear these songs, and these recordings. My goal is to inspire, as much as it is to create and produce.
Risks And Challenges
The lyrics and melodies for most of the songs are already in my head. The first of the songs has already been recorded. As for the remaining elements, I have relationships with seasoned professionals, such as Adam Peri, a brilliant producer/musician with a proven track record for delivering the highest quality results. 
Of course any delays that might be caused by COVID-19, will only effect delivery date, not completion of the album.
Other Ways You Can Help
I'm totally aware that this is not the best of times to ask anyone for financial help.  The strains that COVID has placed on us all makes survival the order of the day.  So I totally understand if you can't chip in for the cost of the album.  That said, if you still feel an urge to help, just make some noise about my campaign.  Spread the word on Indiegogo, Facebook, Twitter, by mouth, e-mail or carrier pigeon.  Anything you can do to help me get this album out, will be greatly appreciated.",1.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>My debut album, Halcyon, is on its way! Help me bring it to life.</strong></p>
<p><i>I want to record my very first album of original music. Excited to share it with you!</i></p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong></p>
<p>My name is Ana Dubyk, I am a musician born in Petroșani, a small town in Romania. Given the uncertainty of the past few months, I want to end this year by working on something that would turn it into a good one. Therefore, I’ve started to plan the recording of my first album – Halcyon. Each song in this album is based on stories about people I have met, about places I have been to and experiences I have had. For example, the first track on this future album, Silence in Petrila. The song also happens to be my first composition and it refers to this mining town, Petrila, that had fallen into serious disrepair. Where most people would have seen nothing but an eyesore, some other people glimpsed the possibility of something brilliant: a cultural center that could turn into a great post-industrial tourist attraction while also bringing residents together. Those few resilient people have so far managed to give birth to a documentary, “Planeta Petrila” (directed by Andrei Dăscălescu), and are struggling to cultivate that sense of community that spans generations. I am one of them - and my debut song, which is part of the documentary soundtrack, tells this story.</p>
<p>I have always known I wanted to be a musician and help my community develop. I studied jazz-pop music composition at the Music University of Bucharest, then I went on to study at The Prince Claus Conservatoire of the Hanze University of Applied Sciences in Groningen, with one semester in New York. I shared the stage with some of the musicians who inspired me and helped me explore the depth and richness of music: Mircea Tiberian, John Betsch, George Dumitriu, Toma Dimitriu, Andrea Caruso, Daniele Nasi, Aleksander Skoric, and many others.</p>
<p>From here, all I need to get my own album off the ground and show Silence in Petrila to the world is a little capital. I believe that change happens when inspiration is shared with everyone - therefore, <strong>I turn to you for help.</strong></p>
<p><strong>WHAT I NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET</strong></p>
<p>Halcyon will have 8 songs (and 2 bonus tracks) that are the embodiment of my experiences as an artist. Every bit of happiness, anger, joy, pain goes into their story, they are deeply powerful and personal. They will be presented in chronological order, from Silence in Petrila to Magic Moon. Rise. All compositions give the musicians the freedom to make their mark and highlight their traits while playing them. Thus, I am happy and thankful that I will be joined in this endeavor by two great musicians and friends: George Dumitriu on guitar and viola, and Andrea Caruso on double-bass. I know they will create the perfect context so that the songs take the best shape possible.</p>
<p>I know that executing this album will come with extra costs for things such as production, mastering, recording, editing, mixing, venue space, marketing, guest artists and more. It all adds up. I am absolutely prepared to invest my money in this beloved project, but I also need some extra help to pull this off in the best way possible – thus, I’ve started an Indiegogo to offset the initial costs of my first album. I am anticipating expenses of about 3000 EUR, so I am setting a goal to raise this exact amount to help bring this special idea to life. </p>
<p>Here's a general breakdown of the costs:</p>
<p><i>Recording (</i>Amsterdam)<i>:</i> 1200 euro</p>
<p><i>Traveling costs: </i>230 euro</p>
<p><i>Accommodation:</i> 400 euro</p>
<p><i>Promotion/Perks: 300 euro</i></p>
<p><i>CDs: 745 euro</i></p>
<p><i>10% unforeseen: 287 euro</i></p>
<p><strong>Total:</strong> 3.162 euro</p>
<p>Of course, there are also some perks lined up for my supporters. EVERYONE who funds the album can take part in a livestream concert I plan to host soon. The following are available for the minimum of these amounts, but if you are willing to offer more, it is much appreciated!</p>
<p>5 EUR – Livestream concert</p>
<p>15 EUR – Halcyon digital download</p>
<p>20 EUR – Halcyon digital download + sticker + postcard + paper bookmark</p>
<p>35 EUR – Halcyon on CD + digital download + postcard + sticker + paper bookmark</p>
<p>50 EUR – CD + bag with artwork by artist Paul Mureșan + postcard + sticker + copper bookmark by Mădălina Luca</p>
<p>100 EUR – Private Vocal Lesson + CD + bag with artwork by artist Paul Mureșan + postcard + sticker + copper bookmark by Mădălina Luca</p>
<p>300 EUR – Private online concert</p>
<p><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></p>
<p><strong>Music can save us in times of crisis. </strong></p>
<p>These past months have been a whirlwind, to say the least. Artists, as so many other categories, have been heavily struck by 2020. I, for one, will remember this year as many things. The year I spent indoors. The year I spent singing online. The year of so many deaths. The year of depression. The year of not knowing.</p>
<p>But we could also remember it as the year of new beginnings. As cities all over the world have shut down to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, videos of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NySV_U_voc&amp;t=7s"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Italians</a> singing from their balconies, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEpkUawiLKA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">policemen in Spain playing guitar</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcjO_cETMUI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">New Yorkers</a> singing along to “Yellow Submarine” from their windows emerged on the internet. People across the globe started making music together and I need to sing along.</p>
<p>I want people who are donating to realize that they have this huge power to impact someone’s life. There’s a part of every one of us that dreams of a better world. Mine is a world where places such as Petrila are saved through creativity and music can be heard even in the most remote corners of the world.</p>
<p><strong>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</strong></p>
<p>The biggest risk I face by not meeting my funding goals is not being able to pay my collaborators, at a time when musicians are struggling to find work and survive. A large part of this campaign will go toward paying them, as they agreed to work on this album with no guarantee of when I would be able to pay them.</p>
<p>If I don't meet my funding goals, l will continue to fund this record slowly, with your help and with the generosity and patience of my collaborators.</p>
<p>If the case, any extra money will be donated to I.D. Sîrbu Memorial House in Petrila, the place where I had my first concert almost 10 years ago.</p>
<p><strong>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</strong></p>
<p>Even if you cannot donate to this campaign<strong>, </strong>that doesn't mean you can't help!</p>
<p>Spread the word about Halcyon to the people you know who you think would like the album! It's thoughtful for them, and meaningful for me.</p>
<p>Follow, enjoy, and share my posts on Instagram and Facebook: </p>
<p>Thank you heaps! Sing on!</p>
<p>Love and light,</p>

I shared the stage with some of the musicians who inspired me and helped me explore the depth and richness of music: Mircea Tiberian, John Betsch, George Dumitriu, Toma Dimitriu, Andrea Caruso, Daniele Nasi, Aleksander Skoric, and many others.
From here, all I need to get my own album off the ground and show Silence in Petrila to the world is a little capital. I believe that change happens when inspiration is shared with everyone - therefore, I turn to you for help.
WHAT I NEED & WHAT YOU GET
Halcyon will have 8 songs (and 2 bonus tracks) that are the embodiment of my experiences as an artist. Every bit of happiness, anger, joy, pain goes into their story, they are deeply powerful and personal. They will be presented in chronological order, from Silence in Petrila to Magic Moon. Rise. All compositions give the musicians the freedom to make their mark and highlight their traits while playing them. Thus, I am happy and thankful that I will be joined in this endeavor by two great musicians and friends: George Dumitriu on guitar and viola, and Andrea Caruso on double-bass. I know they will create the perfect context so that the songs take the best shape possible.
I know that executing this album will come with extra costs for things such as production, mastering, recording, editing, mixing, venue space, marketing, guest artists and more. It all adds up. I am absolutely prepared to invest my money in this beloved project, but I also need some extra help to pull this off in the best way possible – thus, I’ve started an Indiegogo to offset the initial costs of my first album. I am anticipating expenses of about 3000 EUR, so I am setting a goal to raise this exact amount to help bring this special idea to life. 
Here's a general breakdown of the costs:
Recording (Amsterdam): 1200 euro
Traveling costs: 230 euro
Accommodation: 400 euro
Promotion/Perks: 300 euro
CDs: 745 euro
10% unforeseen: 287 euro
Total: 3.162 euro
Of course, there are also some perks lined up for my supporters. EVERYONE who funds the album can take part in a livestream concert I plan to host soon. The following are available for the minimum of these amounts, but if you are willing to offer more, it is much appreciated!
5 EUR – Livestream concert
15 EUR – Halcyon digital download
20 EUR – Halcyon digital download + sticker + postcard + paper bookmark
35 EUR – Halcyon on CD + digital download + postcard + sticker + paper bookmark
50 EUR – CD + bag with artwork by artist Paul Mureșan + postcard + sticker + copper bookmark by Mădălina Luca
100 EUR – Private Vocal Lesson + CD + bag with artwork by artist Paul Mureșan + postcard + sticker + copper bookmark by Mădălina Luca
300 EUR – Private online concert
THE IMPACT
Music can save us in times of crisis. 
These past months have been a whirlwind, to say the least. Artists, as so many other categories, have been heavily struck by 2020. I, for one, will remember this year as many things. The year I spent indoors. The year I spent singing online. The year of so many deaths. The year of depression. The year of not knowing.
But we could also remember it as the year of new beginnings. As cities all over the world have shut down to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, videos of Italians singing from their balconies, policemen in Spain playing guitar and New Yorkers singing along to “Yellow Submarine” from their windows emerged on the internet. People across the globe started making music together and I need to sing along.
I want people who are donating to realize that they have this huge power to impact someone’s life. There’s a part of every one of us that dreams of a better world. Mine is a world where places such as Petrila are saved through creativity and music can be heard even in the most remote corners of the world.
RISKS & CHALLENGES
The biggest risk I face by not meeting my funding goals is not being able to pay my collaborators, at a time when musicians are struggling to find work and survive. A large part of this campaign will go toward paying them, as they agreed to work on this album with no guarantee of when I would be able to pay them.
If I don't meet my funding goals, l will continue to fund this record slowly, with your help and with the generosity and patience of my collaborators.
If the case, any extra money will be donated to I.D. Sîrbu Memorial House in Petrila, the place where I had my first concert almost 10 years ago.
OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP
Even if you cannot donate to this campaign, that doesn't mean you can't help!
Spread the word about Halcyon to the people you know who you think would like the album! It's thoughtful for them, and meaningful for me.
Follow, enjoy, and share my posts on Instagram and Facebook: 
Thank you heaps! Sing on!
Love and light,

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi!  I'm Scott Whitley - thanks for dropping by.  If we haven't met before, I'm mostly known for my work as a bassist (currently working with 80s band Big Country), YouTube content creator, photographer, bass instructor and audio engineer.</p>
<p>Throughout my career I've been lucky enough to have worked alongside some incredible names including The Animals, Jon Walmsley, Big Country, Richard Jobson, Lind Gail Lewis, Bobby Ball, Steve Cropper, The Casuals and many more. The journey so far, though bumpy at times, has moulded me into the artist I am today - the value of which is immeasurable.</p>
<p>2020 stopped musicians all around the world in our tracks and life on the road was no more.  Although for a while all seemed hopeless, the situation offered me the opportunity to work on finally completing my own solo project - something that'd been on the back burner for around 10 years!</p>
<p>Fast Forward to Feb 2021 and after many months, work is now all but complete on the four recordings for my first ever solo release EP, ""In My Shoes"". </p>
<p>The EP features several guest musicians including Christian Madden on keys, Joe Crabtree on drums, Joe Martin &amp; Adam Bidgood on trumpets, Paddy Higginson on sax, Liz Nightingale on baritone sax, Janet Whitley on backing vocals, Chris Lewis on drums, Paul Williams on guitar and of course lil' old me on lead vocals, backing vocals, electric bass, piccolo bass, percussion and additional drums.</p>
<p>I've engineered, mixed and produced the whole thing in house too!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Now that the recordings are nearly ready, I'm raising funds to make this so much more than a mere digital download, with some very special unique perks for those helping fund the project.</p>
<p>The funds raised will be used for pressing of the physical CD, artwork/design costs for the CD cover, T-shirts/Hats and other merch and for the literature that comes with some of the perks.</p>
<p>Some of the perks will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A very limited number of exclusive autographed 7"" coulored vinyl single pressings</li>
<li>Exclusive  autographed Merch including T-Shirts, caps and more</li>
<li>Signed copies of the physical CD</li>
<li>FLAC file downloads</li>
<li>Access to behind the scenes/making-of footage and interviews</li>
<li>Your name printed in the CD sleeve</li>
<li>Tab/Scores for the bass parts</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I hope 1st and foremost that you'll really enjoy and cherish your purchase of my EP and of course that's my primary goal.  But the reality is you'll be helping support my family and I throughout these incredibly challenging times and for that I'd like to thank anyone who gets behind this project in whatever way you can - it'll be appreciated more than you could imagine.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>With this being my first ever solo release, I've no way of gauging how many people will get behind the campaign.  The huge advantage I have is that I've already self-funded all the recording costs so content already exists.  This means that my target can be set much lower than if I were starting from scratch and having to hire studio time, engineers etc.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't or don't want to purchase the EP but you'd still like to help, please share this page with friends and on your social media - the more people know about it, the more change we have of reaching our goal.<br/><br/>Be sure to use the various share tools here on INDIEGOGO! </p>

Es un honor ser testigo de su artesanía, de la integridad con la que camina su rezo y su canto al servicio de la vida. Agradezco su voz en mi vida. La siento delicada y enraizada, femenina, tierra. Me trasmite cuido, belleza y coherencia. Su vibración abre tiempo y espacio sagrado con el que resueno y habito. Todas las bendiciones y apoyo para tu nueva creación, Mariana.” ~ Paloma Todd , Luna de Abril ARAMARA((ENGLISH))This Album is a Water Prayer in the form of Songs.  A journey through the dimensions of Water, and the subtleness of the Voice.The Water of Life, that inspires us and gives us songs,is the main character, the power spirt in command here in our Blue Planet and in this work too.This work is focused on the Voice as an Instrument and its layers.Some songs are simple and you can add your voice too.So that together, we sing to the Water.Songs that you can carry with you, to your favorite Water places, as an offering.“AraMarA” is a tool to support and guide the connection with the Spirt of the Water, giver of life, from which the Water that lives within us is part of.“AraMarA” is also fruit of this time, in which we had to slow down, that is making us look within, focus on the present and on simplicity. In which our daily practices, our relationship with what is sacred, and creativity are very grounding.“AraMarA ~ Voz d’Água”* is a light dot in the starry blanket, a guide in this new era that is arriving, the new dawn. I’ve been carrying some of these songs for a while, and in February of last year, right after “Shakti Sound”**, I recorded the main vocals of some songs in studio, when Tina Malia proposed to help co-produce this dream of a 3rd Album. Then, during the rest of the year 2020 several new songs came down and joined this boat. Now, almost a solar year after, and after a lot of care, watering, international collaborations, “AraMara” is almost ready… for the final mixes, to be mastered, to be printed, and then to go out in to the World, to sail into the 4 winds.This Crowdfunding is a way of calling in for the support,for this Independent Production.To help pay the costs:~the studio hours,~the hardware and software, ~the co-production and the final mixes,~the master, ~the printing, ~to give thanks to the musicians, ~the graphic work ~and more… The elders say the Creator feeds from our Creativity.Let us keep supporting each other.So that we can keep going, growing, believing, creating, breathing fresh air without barriers, gather around the Sacred Fire, drinking alive+clean+free Water, so we can take care of this Earth that holds space for us, able to walk in beauty, in freedom.Grateful,Blessings in your way,Mariana Cortesão Guests healers ~ musicians :  Ivan Looking Horse, Heather Christie, Katari, Diego Peres de Nation Ekeko, Lautaro Zambala, Prem Jitrendra, Gillem Oms, Nataniel Melo, Vir Macoy and Evan Frazer.With the loving help of co-producer, muse, and supporter Tina Malia.To be mastered with Jordi Navarro in “The Room BCN”.Artwork in process :  Rocco Tyndale (Subtempo), Mariana Serra  & Mariana CortesãoCF launch support  : Gabriela Gonçalves, Chechu Garcia + Jaime Abascal. About me, Mariana Cortesão : agualume.commy music : FB , BANDCAMP , SOUND CLOUD , SPOTIFY , YouTube , ...About the name of the Album:I heard it being whispered to me:  AraMara ~Voz d’Água *To the Wixarika people Tatei Haramara “our Mother, the Ocean” is the source of all life, and also the origin of all the waters in the world.

<p><strong>WHO WE ARE</strong></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/funkeetung"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Funkee Tung</a> started out in late 2019, initially as a cover band playing funk and soul classics. Over time, the transient nature of Hong Kong meant that the lineup changed regularly, but by September 2020 we had a tight core group and made a promise to ourselves to devote more attention to our originals. Since then, we’ve played Hong Kong harbour twice, released a single and music video, appeared on RTHK radio and performed at Rula Live, The Wanch, Rio and The Aftermath Bar, as well as live streaming gigs for Music Hotpot and Innonation.</p>
<p>We’re a group of seven including Alan Francis (vocals, guitar), Alec Anderson (guitar), Daniel Cabane (alto sax), Vojta Havrda (tenor sax), Noriko Watanabe (bass), Sean Gu (keys) and William Chapman (percussion). Our influences include funk, soul, britpop, swing jazz and hard rock to name just a few genres.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED</strong></p>
<p>We are looking for HKD20,000 to record our song ""<a href=""https://soundcloud.com/funkeetung/roaring-20s?in=funkeetung/sets/live-at-the-grounds"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Roaring 20s</a>"" with legendary Hong Kong producer John Laudon, who has done work with Hong Kong superstars such as Alan Tam, Eason Chen and Jacky Cheung. He even has a <a href=""https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8A%89%E8%AB%BE%E7%94%9F"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Wikipedia</a> page! The all-inclusive fee covers unlimited time recording, mixing, mastering, producing and arranging the song, which we feel deserves special treatment by a truly established pro. If we are able to exceed this amount, we will look to fund a music video which will cost approximately HKD10,000.</p>
<p>We may not be a cantopop act (though who knows the future), but John Laudon’s personal interest in the funk, soul and rock n roll that makes us tick is why we chose him. The song below that Laudon produced in particular won us over. Our live shows have been a hit, but we’re missing that expertise in the studio that will help us to truly realise our vision for the song. </p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/_irOXwbppgM?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p><br/>We’ll be funding the artwork, marketing and launch party ourselves for the single, so we’re definitely doing our part too. Earlier in the year we self funded a single and music video for “(Let’s Do) The Lockdown”, so let it not be said that we don’t get things done. That video has racked up over 1000 views by now.</p>

</div><div>
<p><strong>THE SONG</strong></p>
<p>Roaring 20s is a fusion of rock and 1920s swing with infectious descending bass lines and saucy sax from our very own Daniel Cabane. The lyrics speak of making the most of your 20s and a nostalgic reflection of the past, with a chorus that could be belted by a large group of drunks at Oktoberfest. Every band member contributes to the arrangement, adding a level of complexity that is interesting, worth multiple listens and delicate to manage in the studio.</p>
<p><br/>You can listen to a live version of the track when we performed it at The Grounds by Hong Kong habour here - <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/funkeetung/roaring-20s?in=funkeetung/sets/live-at-the-grounds"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://soundcloud.com/funkeetung/roaring-20s?in=funkeetung/sets/live-at-the-grounds</a></p>

<p><strong>TESTIMONIALS</strong></p>
<p>“Too perfect” - Cyril Ma</p>
<p>“Swing rock troupe Funkee Tung kicked Funk Ska Nation off with a hell of a bang” - Jasmine Gould-Wilson</p>
<p>""Roaring 20s is a catchy song that sticks in your head and creates nostalgia whilst still sounding new and fresh"" - Mark Francis</p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>IMPACT</strong></p>
<p>We really believe in the potential of this song and feel it has broad appeal. This isn’t just because it’s a catchy tune with a cool groove, but because it fuses rock and swing in a unique way and covers themes which are relatable to anyone. Whether you are just getting older or excited for the decade ahead, the song is both nostalgic and a zeitgeist for the coming decade. The sax lines are really at the core of Roaring 20s and it's an instrument that everyone loves, but rarely gets to shine as it does here. Should the single gain some traction, we hope to follow it up with a gatsby-esque music video and to use it to get high profile local gigs like the Rugby 7s / Clockenflap, as well as getting into regional music festivals.</p>
<p><strong>DEADLINES &amp; COMPLETION</strong></p>
<p>We want to close the funding round by the end of August so we can immediately plan the production with Laudon and get the rhythm section laid down in early September. Vojta will be overseas, but he’ll be back at the end of September to record his parts, which come towards the end, so that we can have the song fully recorded, mixed and mastered by early-mid October. After that, it’s about planning the single for a November / December release with a launch party to reward everyone for their contributions</p>
<p><strong>RISK &amp; CHALLENGES</strong></p>
<p>We need to get this song really tight as the arrangement requires it more than other tracks, so we will need to have many practice sessions to ensure we can play it to a metronome. Luckily, our rhythm section has had some time to gel, so we will nail it with practice. There are also unforeseen delays to recording but we have tried to factor this into the timeline, and Laudon’s experience will ensure this is well managed. </p>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","WHO WE ARE
Funkee Tung started out in late 2019, initially as a cover band playing funk and soul classics. Over time, the transient nature of Hong Kong meant that the lineup changed regularly, but by September 2020 we had a tight core group and made a promise to ourselves to devote more attention to our originals. Since then, we’ve played Hong Kong harbour twice, released a single and music video, appeared on RTHK radio and performed at Rula Live, The Wanch, Rio and The Aftermath Bar, as well as live streaming gigs for Music Hotpot and Innonation.
We’re a group of seven including Alan Francis (vocals, guitar), Alec Anderson (guitar), Daniel Cabane (alto sax), Vojta Havrda (tenor sax), Noriko Watanabe (bass), Sean Gu (keys) and William Chapman (percussion). Our influences include funk, soul, britpop, swing jazz and hard rock to name just a few genres.
WHAT WE NEED
We are looking for HKD20,000 to record our song ""Roaring 20s"" with legendary Hong Kong producer John Laudon, who has done work with Hong Kong superstars such as Alan Tam, Eason Chen and Jacky Cheung. He even has a Wikipedia page! The all-inclusive fee covers unlimited time recording, mixing, mastering, producing and arranging the song, which we feel deserves special treatment by a truly established pro. If we are able to exceed this amount, we will look to fund a music video which will cost approximately HKD10,000.
We may not be a cantopop act (though who knows the future), but John Laudon’s personal interest in the funk, soul and rock n roll that makes us tick is why we chose him. The song below that Laudon produced in particular won us over. Our live shows have been a hit, but we’re missing that expertise in the studio that will help us to truly realise our vision for the song. 

We’ll be funding the artwork, marketing and launch party ourselves for the single, so we’re definitely doing our part too. Earlier in the year we self funded a single and music video for “(Let’s Do) The Lockdown”, so let it not be said that we don’t get things done. That video has racked up over 1000 views by now.

 

THE SONG
Roaring 20s is a fusion of rock and 1920s swing with infectious descending bass lines and saucy sax from our very own Daniel Cabane. The lyrics speak of making the most of your 20s and a nostalgic reflection of the past, with a chorus that could be belted by a large group of drunks at Oktoberfest. Every band member contributes to the arrangement, adding a level of complexity that is interesting, worth multiple listens and delicate to manage in the studio.
You can listen to a live version of the track when we performed it at The Grounds by Hong Kong habour here - https://soundcloud.com/funkeetung/roaring-20s?in=funkeetung/sets/live-at-the-grounds
WHAT YOU GET
HKD100 - You get to hear the finished song before it's released
HKD250 - Guaranteed entry to our launch party
HKD500 - Personalized video for friends and family a la Cameo
HKD750 - Signed limited edition Funkee Tung tote bag
HKD1000- Appearance in our MV and name credited in the single notes
TESTIMONIALS
“Too perfect” - Cyril Ma
“Swing rock troupe Funkee Tung kicked Funk Ska Nation off with a hell of a bang” - Jasmine Gould-Wilson
""Roaring 20s is a catchy song that sticks in your head and creates nostalgia whilst still sounding new and fresh"" - Mark Francis

IMPACT
We really believe in the potential of this song and feel it has broad appeal. This isn’t just because it’s a catchy tune with a cool groove, but because it fuses rock and swing in a unique way and covers themes which are relatable to anyone. Whether you are just getting older or excited for the decade ahead, the song is both nostalgic and a zeitgeist for the coming decade. The sax lines are really at the core of Roaring 20s and it's an instrument that everyone loves, but rarely gets to shine as it does here. Should the single gain some traction, we hope to follow it up with a gatsby-esque music video and to use it to get high profile local gigs like the Rugby 7s / Clockenflap, as well as getting into regional music festivals.
DEADLINES & COMPLETION
We want to close the funding round by the end of August so we can immediately plan the production with Laudon and get the rhythm section laid down in early September. Vojta will be overseas, but he’ll be back at the end of September to record his parts, which come towards the end, so that we can have the song fully recorded, mixed and mastered by early-mid October. After that, it’s about planning the single for a November / December release with a launch party to reward everyone for their contributions
RISK & CHALLENGES
We need to get this song really tight as the arrangement requires it more than other tracks, so we will need to have many practice sessions to ensure we can play it to a metronome. Luckily, our rhythm section has had some time to gel, so we will nail it with practice. There are also unforeseen delays to recording but we have tried to factor this into the timeline, and Laudon’s experience will ensure this is well managed.

<h1>Introducing Neville Jacobs</h1>
<p><strong>A tour de force of veteran musicians collaborating to create an original sound that appeals to ears from all of life's callings.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Fronted by Ivan Neville and Cris Jacobs</strong> and backed by one of the
most sought-after rhythm dream teams, Tony Hall and Brady Blade, Neville Jacobs is a special collaboration that defies musical boundaries to organically produce some of the most notable new music 2015 has to offer.</p>
<p>Both fate and instincts led  Cris Jacobs to collaborate with Ivan Neville. Aside from Jacobs listening to The Neville Brothers growing up and nearly a decade of causal sit ins with one another, Cris Jacobs and Ivan Neville truly connected at the poker table. Playing cards allowed them to relate on a different level away from the hustle and bustle of working musician life. </p>
<p>In the poker room and off the suggestion from producer and fellow card player, Joe Michaels, Neville and Cris Jacobs hit it off, took the prospect of collaborating to heart, and hit the studio in late 2012.</p>
<p>Neville notes that the end product of Neville Jacobs has no preconceived sound because it limits the possibilities. Both Neville and Jacobs brought songs to the table and more often than not, one would start making noise, another would riff off of it, and songs would be born.

<h3>Ivan Neville</h3>
<p>Very few people have the musical clout of Ivan Neville. Born into one of the most-recognized and visionary musical families in history, Neville took to keyboards, bass, and guitar at an early age performing with his father (Aaron) and uncles (Art, Charles, and Cyrill) in The Neville Brothers during his teens. </p>
<p>This no-nonsense musical upbringing led him to move to Los Angeles and apply his demanding musical dexterity to writing, performing, and recording music with powerhouses such as Bonnie Raitt, The Rolling Stones, Keith Richards, Rufus, Spin Doctors and countless others. Since 2003, Neville has been entrenched with his musical brainchild, Dumpstaphunk, whose down and dirty New Orleans funk has become a staple in the national festival circuit and features the heavy rhythm section of Tony Hall and Nick Daniels III (basses); his cousin, Ian Neville (guitar), and Alvin Ford Jr. (formerly Nikki Glaspie) on drums. The group has been hailed as “The best funk band from New Orleans right now” by the New York Times.</p>

<h3>Cris Jacobs</h3>
<p>If there’s one thing to note about Cris Jacobs, it’s that he is not afraid to roll with the punches, see where life leads him and take a gamble on what he believes in. After a successful run with award-winning road warriors, The Bridge, Jacobs decided his next course of action would be to delve into a solo career. Since 2012, he has been on support tours with the likes of Steve Winwood and Sturgill Simpson as well as recorded a full-length album (Songs for Cats and Dogs) with another one on the way.</p>

<h3>Tony Hall</h3>
<p>When it comes to a bassist who can do it all, Tony Hall is the
man for the job. </p>
<p>Hall’s insatiable groove and confidence make bass lines and harmonic interpretation an
“automatic” act for him. Rather than succinctly explain what he is doing or trying to break it down and analyze it, Hall just gets down to business and does what comes most naturally to him. It’s this approach that’s landed him work with Dave Matthews, Trey Anastasio, Harry Connick Jr., Jewel, Emmy Lou Harris and beyond.</p>
<p>His album credits are anthologies within themselves and his diverse body of his
work is unparalleled.</p>
<p>When it comes to Neville Jacobs, the addition of Hall was another element that was “automatic.” Aside from a long-standing relationship with Neville in Dumpstaphunk and beyond, Hall and drummer, Brady Blade, have a long history and are the epitome of a magnum opus rhythm section.</p>

<h3>Brady Blade</h3>
<p>Time and time again, you hear the phrase, “you can’t do it all.” In Brady Blade’s case, he shatters that notion and is a jack of all trades as both a performer and in many facets of the music industry.</p>
<p>Blade, alongside Neville Jacobs rhythmic counterpart, Tony Hall, is known for his work with top artists such as Dave Matthews &amp; Friends, Emmy Lou Harris and Jewel. </p>
<p>Blade founded Blade Studios along side partner Scott Crompton and engineer Chris Bell in 2009 and is also the founder of record label, Brick Top Recordings LLC. Much of his work in recent years includes writing and production and he has a natural craft for developing song-writing and producing, which was one of his key roles in Neville Jacobs.</p>

</div></div>","Introducing Neville Jacobs
A tour de force of veteran musicians collaborating to create an original sound that appeals to ears from all of life's callings. 
Fronted by Ivan Neville and Cris Jacobs and backed by one of the
most sought-after rhythm dream teams, Tony Hall and Brady Blade, Neville Jacobs is a special collaboration that defies musical boundaries to organically produce some of the most notable new music 2015 has to offer.
Both fate and instincts led  Cris Jacobs to collaborate with Ivan Neville. Aside from Jacobs listening to The Neville Brothers growing up and nearly a decade of causal sit ins with one another, Cris Jacobs and Ivan Neville truly connected at the poker table. Playing cards allowed them to relate on a different level away from the hustle and bustle of working musician life. 
In the poker room and off the suggestion from producer and fellow card player, Joe Michaels, Neville and Cris Jacobs hit it off, took the prospect of collaborating to heart, and hit the studio in late 2012.
Neville notes that the end product of Neville Jacobs has no preconceived sound because it limits the possibilities. Both Neville and Jacobs brought songs to the table and more often than not, one would start making noise, another would riff off of it, and songs would be born. Both artists took to the studio with a “let’s see what happens” mentality and thusly created “not a solid project, but a  f*cking great project!” according to Neville.
Prestige and prowess aside, the music of Neville Jacobs speaks for itself. The group is eager to see where the project takes them and to get the music heard by as many people as possible. Neville Jacobs has become a truly organic collaboration with the music taking form out of what feels natural and evolving into an honest, feel-good collection of songs. 
Meet The Band

Very few people have the musical clout of Ivan Neville. Born into one of the most-recognized and visionary musical families in history, Neville took to keyboards, bass, and guitar at an early age performing with his father (Aaron) and uncles (Art, Charles, and Cyrill) in The Neville Brothers during his teens.

Time and time again, you hear the phrase, “you can’t do it all.” In Brady Blade’s case, he shatters that notion and is a jack of all trades as both a performer and in many facets of the music industry.

<p><span><b>While serving faithfully for six years World Prayr has seen a lot of pain and hurt. The main reason is that most are disconnected from local bodies of believers.

<h3><b>Background</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>Vision and Mission</b></p>
<p>World Prayr will aggressively evangelize the web providing online resources of encouragement, support, and prayer. It will also develop a network of believers in Christ that will reconnect hurting people to local ministries and local bodies of believers to offer fellowship, support, and real answers; and treat them as family ought to be treated - nothing more nothing less.</p>
<p><b>Who and what is World Prayr?</b></p>
<p>World Prayr is a global  ministry team seeking out those who need mentoring, prayer and counselling coupled with foundational Biblical teachings; then reconnecting them to an offline local church and/or to a body of fellow believers.  </p>
<p>What started as a little Twitter account has now grown into a global ministry and mission team that is serving as a support for other ministries, authors and changing the culture of churches, while reaching those who have been disconnected from community to help them get reconnected. They do this by offering encouragement, support, prayer and working to connect them to local bodies of believers. With a focus of inspiring others to follow the example of the one who gave the only perfect performance and to live in the freedom that comes from believing “It Is Finished.”</p>
<p>World Prayr is working to be difference makers by establishing greater commonality by being ""Big Kingdom Minded"" in building the kingdom. While working hard to ""Reconnect a Broken World"".</p>
<p>Below are some of those who serve faithfully in the World Prayr Ministry, perhaps you might recognize a face or two.</p>

Being eager to do just that, they got on their cell phones, computers, wherever and whatever, to tell you what being part of the World Prayr ohana means to them. Now, it is easier to say than do, because as you are about to find out, while this video does indeed show the global reach of World Prayr, it is not the best quality. Nonetheless, the responses are heartfelt and genuine. We thank our video team for working hard on taking this rough collection of recording and making something of them.</span><br/></p>

Read More About Our Campaign

Background

Vision and Mission
World Prayr will aggressively evangelize the web providing online resources of encouragement, support, and prayer. It will also develop a network of believers in Christ that will reconnect hurting people to local ministries and local bodies of believers to offer fellowship, support, and real answers; and treat them as family ought to be treated - nothing more nothing less.
Who and what is World Prayr?
World Prayr is a global  ministry team seeking out those who need mentoring, prayer and counselling coupled with foundational Biblical teachings; then reconnecting them to an offline local church and/or to a body of fellow believers.  
What started as a little Twitter account has now grown into a global ministry and mission team that is serving as a support for other ministries, authors and changing the culture of churches, while reaching those who have been disconnected from community to help them get reconnected. They do this by offering encouragement, support, prayer and working to connect them to local bodies of believers. With a focus of inspiring others to follow the example of the one who gave the only perfect performance and to live in the freedom that comes from believing “It Is Finished.”
World Prayr is working to be difference makers by establishing greater commonality by being ""Big Kingdom Minded"" in building the kingdom. While working hard to ""Reconnect a Broken World"".
Below are some of those who serve faithfully in the World Prayr Ministry, perhaps you might recognize a face or two.



We asked our team members to describe in one word what World Prayr means to them. Being eager to do just that, they got on their cell phones, computers, wherever and whatever, to tell you what being part of the World Prayr ohana means to them. Now, it is easier to say than do, because as you are about to find out, while this video does indeed show the global reach of World Prayr, it is not the best quality. Nonetheless, the responses are heartfelt and genuine. We thank our video team for working hard on taking this rough collection of recording and making something of them.

Why are we crowd funding?
World Prayr has been self-funded since our launch in 2009.
We are a lean organization making every cent stretch as far as possible.
We have developed a wonderful community around the globe.
We have seen people rescued, reconnected, and reborn. We know World Prayr works. We want to reach out even further.
For this to happen, we need to grow, develop, and establish our full-time team. We need to underpin World Prayr with sound financing - that is where you can help. By supporting this Indiegogo campaign you can enable World Prayr to take the next step - and above all help to grow the Kingdom of God.

Our goal We are seeking to raise $100,000
We are raising funds to invest in the following key activities:


Faith Factr Store - bringing over 10,000 products from 300 vendors into new store and giving 100% of the profits to the Christian ministries we support around the globe
World Prayr Reconnection App - connecting people with churches and ministries, discipling, guiding prayer life and devotionals and giving 100% of profits to Christian ministries we support around the globe
World Prayr publishing - building on our first book ""Walking in God's Grace"" and giving 100% of profits to the Christian ministries we support around the globe
Strengthening the Local - delivering support to churches and ministries to help reach out to people in their area.

The allocation in the chart below will be applied to any and all the funds we raise with your help.

</h3><p><b>My name is Danny O'Callaghan. I'm a passionate singer, songwriter, and worship leader. This year, with your help, I'm going to be making my first record! </b></p>
<p>It's been a dream of mine for many years to record my own music and my hope for 2015 is that this dream can finally become a reality. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This project began with an invitation for me to travel to the US and record with reputable producer Elijah Mosely (John Mark McMillan, Jonathan &amp; Melissa Helser)  at The Threshing Floor in Asheville,  North Carolina. This is an incredible opportunity for a worship artist like me to be able to work with one of the top producers in the field at a world class studio and I would absolutely love it if you can help me make it happen!</p>
<p>All I need to do to make it happen is your help in raising £10,000. This amount will cover all the costs from start to finish (i.e. studio time, equipment, producer, musician fees and mixing/mastering). Raising these funds would allow me to make professional quality recordings of the songs I've had burning in my heart over all these years. (Anything raised above the target will go towards making videos, building a website and CD production.)</p>
<p>This project is so incredibly valuable to me because it is my life; I live and breathe worship and love to express it through my music. I have the privilege of being involved in a worship movement that brings people together and I continually see the power that worship has to awaken the human heart to love. We were created to love and to be loved. It is in the moments when the music and message of God's love collide that our vision is expanded and the world around is is transformed through an encounter with His presence. This is what this project is all about and I hope to be able to record something that will be able to invite others into those moments. The prospect of recording is one of the most exciting and scary things I've done. I've featured on and made a few music projects before but these songs and this record is something that has been birthed entirely out of my own walk with the Lord. </p>
<p>Partnering in this dream of mine also has its perks (not to mention the satisfaction of making a man's dream come true!). Check out all the options on the page to see what things are on offer - I would feel so honoured if you would join with me by sowing into this record. Every little helps!</p>
<p>If you're not able to give financially, you can help in other ways. Please help me to get the word out to people who would want to invest in this! </p>

<p>From the start is has been LEAF's intention to reconnect people back to nature, their history and to each other. The new album will be a continuation of this journey.</p>
<p>On the new LEAF album we will breathe life back into the cultural heritage and folklore of the Nordic and Scandinavian countries. By revocalizing authentic, almost forgotten languages and intwining these voices of the past with the melodies coming from within. LEAF will create an album that treasures and guards the images and wisdom of our ancestors, bringing it back to the ears and hearts of the people LEAF's new full Album will be it's second release, following up on the successfully received debut EP 'Leaf' from 2011.</p>

<p>All recordings for the new album will be done by Fieke van den Hurk at the ORCHVS studio in the Netherlands. Known from recordings for OMNIA, Cesair, Jyoti Verhoeff and many more music projects. Vocal recordings will be done by Christoffer Juul of LAVA studio (Of euzen, valravn, heilung and many more) </p><p>Fieke has been involved with LEAF from the start and will contribute her energy and talent to the new album.

<h4>Why we need your help to raise funds</h4>
<p>This fundraising project via INDIEGOGO is set up to connect our collective energy of our listeners, to help us birth the first full length album of LEAF. We simply cannot do it without that help and whatever you have to spare for our production.</p>
<p>The funds will make it possible able to record the songs further and complete the mixing and mastering in the studio. Also, we will be able to bring it from written songs and
concepts to something concrete and materialized in your hands.</p>
<p>For this all to happen we do need YOUR help, our supportive audience and that of our old and new listeners. This means we will need your
excitement, your trust and your donation upfront before you can acquire the full
CD.</p>

reality.</span></p>
<h4>The release</h4>
<p>The release date itself cannot be set to a concrete date at this part of the production stage. This is also because we aim to make an album CD that will stand the test of time and will remain a joy to listen to. To really capture what we want to bring out to world.  We strife for perfection, not a rush job.</p>
<p>However, we do promise you this</p>
<ul>
<li>We will start right away, recording more of the new songs and continue the production until it is finished. People who we work with often, know our passion and  drive in creating. So we will not stand still. When the funds arive, we will dive in at the deep end with the whole team</li>
<li>We will keep you updated. Every step along the way we will communicate via all the channels available to us. You will know the status of the album as it develops.</li>
<li>We strife to have the album done in the SUMMER of 2015, now this is not a promise but a intended production goal. A goal that we will work very hard for to achieve with all the producers who are at work.</li>
</ul>

This fundraising project via INDIEGOGO is set up to connect our collective energy of our listeners, to help us birth the first full length album of LEAF. We simply cannot do it without that help and whatever you have to spare for our production.
The funds will make it possible able to record the songs further and complete the mixing and mastering in the studio. Also, we will be able to bring it from written songs and
concepts to something concrete and materialized in your hands.
For this all to happen we do need YOUR help, our supportive audience and that of our old and new listeners. This means we will need your
excitement, your trust and your donation upfront before you can acquire the full
CD.
In helping us raise these funds you will, of course, get the music. And hopefully the realisation and satisfaction that by helping us out you are a significant part of making this LEAF CD a 
reality.
The release
The release date itself cannot be set to a concrete date at this part of the production stage. This is also because we aim to make an album CD that will stand the test of time and will remain a joy to listen to. To really capture what we want to bring out to world.  We strife for perfection, not a rush job.
However, we do promise you this

We will start right away, recording more of the new songs and continue the production until it is finished. People who we work with often, know our passion and  drive in creating. So we will not stand still. When the funds arive, we will dive in at the deep end with the whole team
We will keep you updated. Every step along the way we will communicate via all the channels available to us. You will know the status of the album as it develops.
We strife to have the album done in the SUMMER of 2015, now this is not a promise but a intended production goal. A goal that we will work very hard for to achieve with all the producers who are at work.

Other ways you can help
Help us get the word out! Share it everywhere you can, facebook, twitter, blogs, websites, anywhere online. Tell your brothers, sisters, parents, classmates, friends and lovers. Anyone who might be interested in this very exciting, spiritual music project.
Also, do not forget the Indiegogo share tool on this very website.

 About The Songs
Two songs deal with specific issues of the chemically
sensitive “Home Song” and ""I'm Too Tired"" 
Several songs deal with isolation, a painful part of living with chronic illness. Susan tackles the subject with a sense of humor in “What’s Not Wrong?” and sweet
compassion “In the Stillness” and “Joanie’s Song”. These themes are universal as well. 
Other tunes focus on the joys of life by writing about the things that Susan loves: “Ella” “Under Santa Fe Skies” “For
You”, “Tender Moments” and “Caffiene” (by Patty Larkin). Instrumental music from the film e.g. ""Lullabye"", will also be included.

MiC programs have a proven track record for success in bringing youth of all walks to the table of peace:


94% of MiC program participants said Music in Common helped them develop skills for communicating and working with others   


88% of MiC program participants said they learned things about the faiths and cultures of other program participants that they did not know beforehand and 75% said this experience changed their perceptions of people from those faiths and cultures


88% of MiC program participants said they had grown as a person from their experience in the program


On a scale of 1-5 with 5 being the best, MiC programs received a cumulative score of 4.5 or higher from program participants


Simply by virtue of what we do, MiC faces challenges on a daily basis.  Time and again, we have prevailed even in the face of the most trying of odds - including active conflict during programming - a testament of our commitment to our work.

<h3><b>About the World Air Guitar Championships:</b></h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>The World Air Guitar Championships were started in 1996 with a dream of encouraging world peace and love. Every year since thousands of people flock to the northern city of Oulu, Finland to see people jump around playing an invisible guitar with the shared goal of becoming the next World Champion. This is the 20th year of the championships. Since it’s incarnation it has grown to include over 20 countries spanning many different languages and religions with more joining the cause every year. The idea is that anybody anywhere can be a world champion. Air Guitar doesn’t judge people based on gender, religion, ethnicity, social status, or any thing else. Air Guitar is completely inclusive. The Air Guitar World Championships were started as a way to promote world peace and bring people together in solidarity. The Ancient Air Guitar proverb goes <b>“When you are holding an Air Guitar, you can’t be holding a gun.”</b> To this day that same sentiment is echoed by every Air Guitarist as we shred our way to peace. In the beginning it was thought to be a completely ridiculous idea but has proved that sometimes it takes something ridiculous to bring change!</p>

<h3><b>RULES:</b></h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Air Guitar Alberta runs events with the rules established and set fourth by the Air Guitar World Championship in Oulu, Finland. </p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>performances are limited to 60 seconds each</li>
<li>This can be any part of a song or any number of mashed songs.</li>
<li>Back up bands are not allowed (real or Air)</li>
<li>Air Roadies are permitted but must vacate the stage before competitor starts</li>

</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><b>Judging Criteria:</b></h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Panels are made up of 3-5 independent judges. All performances are scored on a scale of 4.0 - 6.0 with 6.0 being the highest (just like figure skating). If there are 5 Judges the highest and lowest scores are eliminated to prevent bias. Each Air Guitarist is given a single score for each round, the competitor with the highest combined score at the end is the winner. If there is a tie for first place a sudden victory round will be implemented. Judging criteria can be is based on 6 key categories:</p>
<p>
</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Originality</b></li>
<li><b>The Ability To Be Taken Over By The Music</b></li>
<li>
<b>Stage Charisma </b>- How engaging are they? Are they pulling off any rock moves like the power slide, Windmill, throwing the guitar in the Air, Pre tuning, jumps or flips. This is where a performers personality shows through. </li>
<li>
<b>Technical Merit </b>- They don’t have to hit every note perfectly, but they should have a working understanding of how a guitar works. The more they work the fret board the better. Flips and tricks are great, but it doesn't mean a thing if they aren't rocking the guitar just as hard.</li>
<li><b>Artistic Impression</b></li>
<li>
<b>“Airness” </b>- Many definitions exist for this incredibly vague yet important criteria. It is often the most difficult to explain and usually the most decisive element to any Air Guitar performance. Officially it is when an Air Guitarists performance transcends the limitation of a real guitar and becomes an art form in itself. It is that little bit of crazy that every Air Guitarist knows, it’s that special something that sets the performer apart. It is the ability to make the observers forget they are watching someone jump around with an imaginary guitar and believe in the power of Air.</li>

</div><p></p><p>This project is the first
of its kind for both James Montgomery and I in our over 35 years each in the
music business. Though both well versed in music performance and doing benefit
work for others we have taken it upon ourselves to create our own organization
and control the way we raise funds and overs their distribution.</p>
<p>James has been one of New
England’s top performers over the last 5 decades, preceding many of Boston’s
best known acts to the top. He has continued to be one of the hardest workers
in the movement of assisting veterans. As you can see, from the attached video,
he did not become a proponent of support as a recent cause but goes back to the
70’s in his support of it.</p>
<p>He has done events of all
sorts to support the cause ranging from large concert events to performing in
the lobby and rooms at VA hospitals to a handful of vets during their morning
coffee. He does not seek any rewards for these efforts but rather looks the
pleasures he brings to these veterans.</p>
<p>Myself, over the last 35
years have had the pleasure of working with and touring with many great
performers here and abroad as a tour manager and producer, learning every facet
of how an event like this must be done if it is to be done properly.

</p><p><span>On the other hand I come to
it as a veteran. I served at the tail end of Vietnam and was fortunate not to
have been deployed there. My luck came in the fact as I was finishing basic
training the US ceased sending fresh troops to Vietnam. Though if ordered I
would have gone; I am thankful it did not come to that.</span></p>
<p>We both have disagreed with
the Government over the battles we have waged overseas during our lives; even
enough to attend protests and write to politicians to show our displeasure with
them. The one thing that has never wavered though, is our support for the men
and women who have been willing to make that ultimate sacrifice so that the
rest of us are able to enjoy the freedoms they help afford us. Though these
veterans may have felt as I did when enlisting, not willing to enter the fray
but realizing someone must answer the call. We feel this is one way we can help
repay those who did not return home the same as they left.</p>
<p>This project is important
to us because in a small way we will be able to help fund several of the
Veteran’s Assistance Organizations we have worked with over the years, through
sales of the CD that will be produced from this live event. We also feel from
discussions with patients and outpatients at the VA Hospitals we have been to
that those people would enjoy the ability to get out for the day and attend an
event that is centered on them and not on others. Their small reward.</p>
<p>The contributions to this
campaign will allow us to put in the concert and record the CD to help further
our assistance with these programs. The number of programs we can assist is
limitless and we realize we cannot help all of them, but feel if we can even
help one of them our efforts will not be wasted.</p>
<p>We need your assistance and
are reaching out for your help in funding this project. The funding campaign
will be used to underwrite the cost of the tickets we will be distributing to
Veterans Hospitals for those out-patient vets who have expressed a desire to
attend and to pay for the cost of the actual recording. The actual event is
limited to only 100 general admission tickets, not nearly enough to help cover
the costs of what we are seeking to do. But enough to provide the seed money to
begin the project. Were we to sell the remaining 450 tickets we would not need
to fund this; but we would not be able to do this in the way we envision
honoring those who sacrificed for us.</p>
<p>We have created a set of
perks, that we hope people will find creative and there are more to be added.
The attempt is to raise funds for the event itself and the actual recording of
it and give people things that specifically as music fans they may appreciate.
We are very thankful to the musicians who have donated of their time to make
these contributions at no expense to themselves.</p>
<p>Should we fall short of our
goal we will not be deterred in moving forward, rather we will need to reduce
the number of tickets we can donate to the Veterans and delay the release of
the resulting CD while exploring alternative funding sources reducing what we
can ultimately provide to the Veterans. Under no circumstance will we cancel
the event because we feel these people have already sacrificed enough for us
and we will find a sacrifice to make for them.</p>
<p>In closing please let me
express to you the importance this project means to us. We will not give up on
it as it is to important to us to not complete it. We have not been asked to
sacrifice nearly as much as these heroes have, but they have asked us for
nothing in return. As they did, I learned in the service that an obstacle must
be overcome and there is nothing you can’t overcome with persistence and drive.</p>
<p>With this as our plea to
you we hope you feel this is a worthy cause. Worthy of your help in helping
those who ask nothing in return from us for their sacrifices. We hope you feel
the same way and if so are willing to take advantage of the perks we are
offering. Some which will benefit you and most which will benefit the veterans.</p>
<p>And please, if you like our
goal please feel free to share it with your friends because no contribution
will be deemed as to small of insignificant for this cause.</p>

The contributions to this
campaign will allow us to put in the concert and record the CD to help further
our assistance with these programs. The number of programs we can assist is
limitless and we realize we cannot help all of them, but feel if we can even
help one of them our efforts will not be wasted.
We need your assistance and
are reaching out for your help in funding this project. The funding campaign
will be used to underwrite the cost of the tickets we will be distributing to
Veterans Hospitals for those out-patient vets who have expressed a desire to
attend and to pay for the cost of the actual recording. The actual event is
limited to only 100 general admission tickets, not nearly enough to help cover
the costs of what we are seeking to do. But enough to provide the seed money to
begin the project. Were we to sell the remaining 450 tickets we would not need
to fund this; but we would not be able to do this in the way we envision
honoring those who sacrificed for us.
We have created a set of
perks, that we hope people will find creative and there are more to be added.
The attempt is to raise funds for the event itself and the actual recording of
it and give people things that specifically as music fans they may appreciate.
We are very thankful to the musicians who have donated of their time to make
these contributions at no expense to themselves.
Should we fall short of our
goal we will not be deterred in moving forward, rather we will need to reduce
the number of tickets we can donate to the Veterans and delay the release of
the resulting CD while exploring alternative funding sources reducing what we
can ultimately provide to the Veterans. Under no circumstance will we cancel
the event because we feel these people have already sacrificed enough for us
and we will find a sacrifice to make for them.
In closing please let me
express to you the importance this project means to us. We will not give up on
it as it is to important to us to not complete it. We have not been asked to
sacrifice nearly as much as these heroes have, but they have asked us for
nothing in return. As they did, I learned in the service that an obstacle must
be overcome and there is nothing you can’t overcome with persistence and drive.
With this as our plea to
you we hope you feel this is a worthy cause. Worthy of your help in helping
those who ask nothing in return from us for their sacrifices. We hope you feel
the same way and if so are willing to take advantage of the perks we are
offering. Some which will benefit you and most which will benefit the veterans.
And please, if you like our
goal please feel free to share it with your friends because no contribution
will be deemed as to small of insignificant for this cause.

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>THE STORY   A celebration of melody, rhythm and soul, ORIENTE was formed in the early ‘90's by Cuban guitarist and songwriter, Eddy Balzola, at a time when Cuban roots music in South Florida was still taking a back seat to Latin pop and cookie-cutter Salsa. Eddy's deep respect for his roots plus Jazz and Blues and a lifelong love affair with early '70's Soul music, were the major influences on his new musical adventure and ultimately distinguished ORIENTE from other great Latin Jazz groups.  </i></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>With only a rough cassette recording and the word of a respected New Orleans' musician, the band's official debut was at that city's premier jazz club, Snug Harbor. Snug's audiences were accustomed to very funky and progressive music and, with raw energy, ORIENTE delivered that and more. Over the years the band's evolution has seen some changes in instrumentation and personnel but the heart and soul of the music remains organic and fresh. </i></p>

ORIENTE has made four recordings to date, all great but all on a shoestring.  Tracks for the newest release, titled ""Soul eNclave"", have been recorded live in the studio as well as the vocal parts, and now it's time to add some amazing guest instrumentalists. The additional recording along with mixing, mastering, artwork, disc production and promotion lay ahead, which beckons this humbling request for donations from friends, fans and believers.   </span></i></p>

Over the years the band's evolution has seen some changes in instrumentation and personnel but the heart and soul of the music remains organic and fresh. 

THE CHALLENGE   In spite of the band's reputation and consistent performances, the myriad of costs involved in producing a recording, not to mention touring in support of the new music, is almost unaffordable. ORIENTE has made four recordings to date, all great but all on a shoestring.  Tracks for the newest release, titled ""Soul eNclave"", have been recorded live in the studio as well as the vocal parts, and now it's time to add some amazing guest instrumentalists. The additional recording along with mixing, mastering, artwork, disc production and promotion lay ahead, which beckons this humbling request for donations from friends, fans and believers.   
THE MUSIC  This new CD features some of the finest musicians in the land alongside Balzola's melodic guitar riffs and poetic lyrics - band mates Yoel Del Sol (congas and multi-percussion), William Paredes (trombone), Dony Felix (bass), and Orlando Machado and Rey Monroig alternating on trap drums. Guests will include Stuart King on trumpet, alto saxophonist Jesse Jones, Jr., tenor saxophonist Felipe Lamoglia, percussionist Raymer Olalde and harmonica virtuoso Randy Singer. Most of the songs are composed and arranged by Balzola including EARTH TONES (an uptempo Latin Jazz number with flavors of Eddie Palmieri and Mardi Gras Indians) and OVERTOWN REDEMPTION (Southern Gospel meets cha cha cha). ECHOES OF TRANE TRACKS brings together Coltrane classics, Naima and Equinox with  guaguanco' and features Balzola's eloquent spoken word tribute to JC in a style reminiscent of the Nuyorican Poets and Gil Scott-Heron, and IBIANO - dedicated to the band's late bassist Pepe Aparicio, a beloved friend and mentor, who had adopted the arrangement from his time playing with Mongo Santamaria.
THE TRUTH   At a time when live music, performed by live and dedicated musicians, is in danger of being totally replaced by tracks and gimmicks, ORIENTE stands alongside those who believe there is nothing more powerful and beautiful than a story told through the poetry, melodies, rhythms and sounds of a well crafted song. ORIENTE's musicians are full-time players and some also teach music. They are fabulous cats who dedicate their lives to music and art, and any amount of donation will be appreciated and put toward the final production costs of this beautiful new recording. You can follow the band, listen to the music, view videos, calendar etc. at  http://orienteband.com/ or https://www.facebook.com/Orienteworldmusic . William Paredes    Eddy Balzola     Yoel Del Sol        Dony Felix     Raymer Olalde",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Summary</h3>My name is <b>Innosanto Nagara</b>, and I'm the author and illustrator of two successful children's books, <i>A is for Activist</i> and <i>Counting on Community</i>. I wrote these books to fulfill my desire to have books that reflected my family's values to read to my two year old. Little did I know that they would eventually be in independent bookstores across the US and around the world.<br/><br/>But there has always been another thing that I've missed. You see, I grew up in Indonesia, and when my son was born, I went looking for recordings of some of the Indonesian songs that I grew up on. Unfortunately, despite finding some good individual recordings, I have not been able to find an album of the most well known Indonesian songs from our youth that is not so heavily produced that it feels better suited for a TV show than my child's bedroom. <br/><br/>To make a long story short, after commiserating with my brother <b>Biko Nagara</b>, who happens to be an awesome musician, and my friend <b>Suzi Herawati (Ujie)</b>, who happens to be an amazing singer—we decided to record our own.

<div>As I shared in the video, I've been writing music and singing for quite some time.

As we were writing the songs, my heart was inspired to make music that's <i>accessible</i> to the listener/worshiper--no matter the season, walk of life, or circumstances. The songs come from a personal place in my own walk with Him, but they were written for <i><b>us</b></i>. My prayer is that these songs will become a collective prayer, celebration, and declaration of truth, and ultimately, lift your eyes to Jesus. </div>

<br/><b>CLUBBERS DIE YOUNGER </b>chystá pořádnou párty a potřebuje vaši
pomoc! Pokud jste narazili na tuto kampaň, možná nás už znáte, ale pro ty
z vás, kteří se s námi setkávají poprvé: CLUBBERS DIE YOUNGER je
pravidelná hudební akce, zaměřená na alternativní scénu, která se pokouší vnést
do Brna trochu té méně tradiční hudby (o tu se starají nejrůznější kapely a
goth/industrial/cyber/electro DJové) a ještě méně tradiční zábavy (body-mod a
BDSM představení, gothic belly dance, pole dance…) <br/>Momentálně se připravujeme na
naši zatím největší akci – oslavu <b>2. narozenin CDY 16.5. 2015</b> se čtyřmi
kapelami, z nichž tři jsou zahraniční (včetně úžasné Tying Tiffany). Chceme dělat i nadále co nejlepší
akce, ale co si budeme povídat, bez peněz to v dnešní době není lehké! Jsme
jen dvě, a nemáme žádné sponzory ani jiné zdroje financování pro naši akci. Momentálně
jsme tedy na všechno samy, včetně pokrývání nemalých nákladů, které se na této
scéně zkrátka nevrací. Zároveň nechceme zvyšovat cenu lístků, která zatím nikdy
nepřekročila 180,- , protože si přejeme, aby naše akce byly dostupné opravdu
pro každého, včetně studentů, kteří nevydělávají. <br/>Proto se obracíme na vás
s prosbou o pomoc! <b>Mrkněte se na naši kampaň a chcete-li, aby to
v Brně žilo, podpořte nás – každá koruna se počítá!</b> Těm, kteří přispějí
trošku více, rádi pošleme některou z cen od nás samotných, nebo od kapel,
které se Clubbers Die Younger účastní. Informace o cenách jsou k dispozici
v angličtině i v češtině, takže vám nic nebrání, vybrat si tu svou! <b>Pokud
patříte k jedincům, kterým paypal a indiegogo nic neříká, ale přesto nám
chcete pomoci, můžete poslat příspěvek i jednoduchým bankovním převodem na účet
<a href=""https://www.servis24.cz/ebanking-s24/ib/base/inf/productlist/accounts?execution=e4s1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">1251624023</a> </b>– stačí
přidat variabilní symbol 160515 (datum naší příští akce). <br/>Cíl, kterého bychom
rády dosáhly, by měl v kombinaci s penězi, které získáme prodejem
lístků, pokrýt veškeré náklady. Pokud onu částku nevybereme, akce stejně
proběhne, jen to pro nás bude náročnější. Pokud získáme víc peněz, než je
cílová částka, vše poctivě uschováme na další koncert! Jestli chcete o nás a
naší kampani vědět víc, následují vyčerpávající informace v angličtině.<br/>

<h3>AND NOW IN ENGLISH!</h3>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>WHO WE ARE</b></p>
<p><b>Clubbers Die Younger (CDY) </b>is a regular club event, mainly focused
on goth/industrial/cyber/electronic/alternative genres. It takes place in various venues
around Brno, Czech Republic, and provides the alternative scene with  a semi-monthly dose of music, dance and other
interesting program. CDY was created 2
years ago by two girls that weren´t happy with the declining state of local
subculture - one of them had plenty of experience with organizing events, the
other brought in lots of youthful enthusiasm. We wanted to fill the gap left on the goth
scene and offer both seasoned and new people a place to meet like-minded
individulas, have fun and dance their heart out. And we also wanted them to be
able to see bands they love in their hometown, not only at summer festivals in
Poland or Germany!</p>
<p><b>WHAT WE DO</b></p>
<p>Through better and worse, we have stuck with this party for
two years already, and have no intention of stopping! During this time, we have
invited various DJs from Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Poland and
Australia, and organized a number of concerts, from popular electronic bands,
such as H.Exe, to unique concerts, such as Gothic Prince Ken from
Australia/Japan. We also support new bands on the scene – last year, two young
and promising cyberpunk bands had their first show at CDY. Furthermore, we
attempt to form a connection between underground music scene and the BDSM scene
by incorporating thematic body-modification and BDSM performances into our
events. We also feature gothic belly dance and tribal fusion dancers and a
variety of other performers to provide our visitors with a broad range of
amusement. </p>

</p>
<p>In the future, we would love to make our events even bigger
and better, and most importantly, bring well-known bands to Brno. Our town is
strategically placed within 2 hours of 3 capital cities: Prague, Vienna and
Bratislava. In the distant past, it used to be frequented by people travelling
between these cities, and nowadays, it´s still an awesome place to be included
in band tours! And trust me, bands LOVE to come here – they like the Czech
Republic, the enthusiasm of our audience, and last but not least, our pretty
girls and cheap beer. There is a problem, though: we can´t really afford them. </p>
<p>CLUBBERS DIE YOUNGER has no sponsors whatsoever, no grants
from the city/country, virtually no source of funding. One of us is a
self-employed translator, the other is still a student, and we pay EVERYTHING
by ourselves. If there is a financial loss, we have to bear it – and when
organizing an underground concert in our town, the chance of a huge financial
loss is very, very high. There is no chance to get back what we invested solely
through the income generated by ticket sales, even if attendance is high,
because our tickets are generally priced around 5 Eur. While it seems the
logical decision would be rising their price, we do not want to do that,
because our goal is for everyone to be able to afford attending our events. The
financial situation of most people here, be it due to crisis or general low
incomes, frequently doesn´t allow for spending 20 or 30 Eur on a concert.
Moreover, Brno is a student town, which means that the biggest part of our
audience is composed of young people, who hardly have any income at all. </p>
<p><b>WHAT WE NEED</b></p>
<p>Currently, we are planning a 2nd birthday party of CLUBBERS
DIE YOUNGER on 16.5. 2015 – our largest event so far, with 4 bands, 3 of them from
abroads, several Djs, pole dance performance and other surprises. (Check out
the poster and event link below!) It´s success or failure could mark the future
of CDY.  </p>
<p>Please, help us make this event huge! To cover most (not
all!) expenses, we need to raise 1000 Eur. This amout of money together with
what we gain from ticket sales, will assure that we will not have to reach into
our own pockets to cover for losses, and that everything, including small
things like refreshments for our bands, will be safely provided for. What we
aim for is for everyone to be able to afford attending our party, and we hope
that those of you who can, will not mind spending a little bit more to support
our campaign, so that we wouldn´t have to bear the expenses alone. <br/></p>
<p>Any help
from our friends, subculture folks and like-minded people from abroads will be
greatly appreciated too! For you, 5 Eur is the price for a subway ticket. For
us, it is how much we get for one person attending the show! Please, consider
spending a few Eur to support our case and enable the subculture in a smaller
country to thrive. Even the tiniest amount of money makes a huge difference! To
make this sweeter, we have prepared a few perks for you - in collaboration with
some of the bands performing at our birthday event (Bart Cathedral/Splendor,
LateXJesus and Der Himmel über Berlin). Please, check them out, perhaps you´ll
discover something you fancy! </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: All the money raised
through this campaign will be used to cover the expenses of Clubbers Die
Younger Birthday Party. In case that more money than the necessary amount is
raised, we will not keep any of it for ourselves. Instead, we will invest it in
future events, which take place every month! In case the goal is not met, the
birthday party will, of course, still take place, we will still be thankful for
whatever money we have raised, and cover the rest of the expenses from our
pocket! All the perks purchased will be signed on 16.5. 2015 and sent out
within a week after the event (or handed to you personally, in case you attend
the event). </p>

CLUBBERS DIE YOUNGER chystá pořádnou párty a potřebuje vaši
pomoc! Pokud jste narazili na tuto kampaň, možná nás už znáte, ale pro ty
z vás, kteří se s námi setkávají poprvé: CLUBBERS DIE YOUNGER je
pravidelná hudební akce, zaměřená na alternativní scénu, která se pokouší vnést
do Brna trochu té méně tradiční hudby (o tu se starají nejrůznější kapely a
goth/industrial/cyber/electro DJové) a ještě méně tradiční zábavy (body-mod a
BDSM představení, gothic belly dance, pole dance…) Momentálně se připravujeme na
naši zatím největší akci – oslavu 2. narozenin CDY 16.5. 2015 se čtyřmi
kapelami, z nichž tři jsou zahraniční (včetně úžasné Tying Tiffany). Chceme dělat i nadále co nejlepší
akce, ale co si budeme povídat, bez peněz to v dnešní době není lehké! Jsme
jen dvě, a nemáme žádné sponzory ani jiné zdroje financování pro naši akci. Momentálně
jsme tedy na všechno samy, včetně pokrývání nemalých nákladů, které se na této
scéně zkrátka nevrací. Zároveň nechceme zvyšovat cenu lístků, která zatím nikdy
nepřekročila 180,- , protože si přejeme, aby naše akce byly dostupné opravdu
pro každého, včetně studentů, kteří nevydělávají. Proto se obracíme na vás
s prosbou o pomoc! Mrkněte se na naši kampaň a chcete-li, aby to
v Brně žilo, podpořte nás – každá koruna se počítá! Těm, kteří přispějí
trošku více, rádi pošleme některou z cen od nás samotných, nebo od kapel,
které se Clubbers Die Younger účastní. Informace o cenách jsou k dispozici
v angličtině i v češtině, takže vám nic nebrání, vybrat si tu svou! Pokud
patříte k jedincům, kterým paypal a indiegogo nic neříká, ale přesto nám
chcete pomoci, můžete poslat příspěvek i jednoduchým bankovním převodem na účet
1251624023 – stačí
přidat variabilní symbol 160515 (datum naší příští akce). Cíl, kterého bychom
rády dosáhly, by měl v kombinaci s penězi, které získáme prodejem
lístků, pokrýt veškeré náklady. Pokud onu částku nevybereme, akce stejně
proběhne, jen to pro nás bude náročnější. Pokud získáme víc peněz, než je
cílová částka, vše poctivě uschováme na další koncert! Jestli chcete o nás a
naší kampani vědět víc, následují vyčerpávající informace v angličtině.

AND NOW IN ENGLISH!

WHO WE ARE
Clubbers Die Younger (CDY) is a regular club event, mainly focused
on goth/industrial/cyber/electronic/alternative genres. It takes place in various venues
around Brno, Czech Republic, and provides the alternative scene with  a semi-monthly dose of music, dance and other
interesting program. CDY was created 2
years ago by two girls that weren´t happy with the declining state of local
subculture - one of them had plenty of experience with organizing events, the
other brought in lots of youthful enthusiasm. We wanted to fill the gap left on the goth
scene and offer both seasoned and new people a place to meet like-minded
individulas, have fun and dance their heart out. And we also wanted them to be
able to see bands they love in their hometown, not only at summer festivals in
Poland or Germany!
WHAT WE DO
Through better and worse, we have stuck with this party for
two years already, and have no intention of stopping! During this time, we have
invited various DJs from Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Poland and
Australia, and organized a number of concerts, from popular electronic bands,
such as H.Exe, to unique concerts, such as Gothic Prince Ken from
Australia/Japan. We also support new bands on the scene – last year, two young
and promising cyberpunk bands had their first show at CDY. Furthermore, we
attempt to form a connection between underground music scene and the BDSM scene
by incorporating thematic body-modification and BDSM performances into our

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></h3>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Why Plant THIS Seed??!!</span></h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">My name is Kenny Ray Horton. I am an R.I.A.A. certified gold record awarded songwriter and country/bluegrass singer needing your help in the funding of my new record! With your support, recording will start in January 2016. The goal is to release the record by July of 2016. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I have great musicians and music industry professionals ready to record, promote and market this record. The only thing stopping me right now is $25,000 to get this album recorded, packaged and marketed.</span><br/></p>
<p><b><i>Clearing the Land!</i></b> </p>
<p>I am and have been serving in the United States Navy for 15 years. I am a singer and guitar player for the Navy's Premier Country and Bluegrass group, ""Country Current"", in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>After retirement from the Navy in 5 years, I will be able to focus full time on my music career. This gives me 5 years to prepare for that transition! Because of my opportunities and experiences in the Navy, I am a stronger writer, singer and performer and am more confident than ever!</p>
<p><b><i><br/></i></b></p>
<p><b><i>I Had A Farm Before This!</i></b></p>
<p>Prior to the Navy, I was a staff songwriter in Nashville, TN and have had music recorded by Kenny Rogers and Donnie Osmond! Check out Kenny Rogers' album 'The Gift' - look for the track called ""A Soldier's King""! You'll see my name next to it!<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p>
<p>I have had the opportunity to record with some AMAZING musicians, such as <b>Adam Steffey</b> on mandolin (The Boxcars and Allison Krause &amp; Union Station), <b>Barry Bales</b> on upright bass (Allison Krause &amp; Union Station) and the incredible songwriter, <b>Verlon Thompson </b>(Guitar Player for Guy Clark and Writer of 'Boats To Build' by Jimmy Buffett and 'You Say You Will' by Trisha Yearwood), helping me write songs!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b><i>Planting the Crop! </i></b> </p>
<p>I'm humbled by the fact that there are many super talented folks involved with this project! To have folks willing to help an artist like me is amazing! To add YOU to that list would make it even more so!</p>
<p><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Joining me by fully funding this campaign doesn't just get a record released and out there for sale, it launches my career!</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">  I'm excited  for a new adventure and the successful funding of this record! I know the next 5 years will be filled with a lot of hard work towards a future career in music, but my experiences in Nashville and the Navy have prepared me for it and I'm ready to dive in!</span></p>
<br/> </div> <div> <h3>Harvest is $25,000 - Why??!!</h3>
<ul> </ul>
<div>Why do we need $25,000? Major record labels will spend millions to make and promote a record. Indie artists have learned that this can be done for a fraction of the cost. How can we do this? Because we don't spend money frivilously. </div>
<div>Just getting a record out to the folks is a daunting task, even for an established artist! I will need a team to help me execute my marketing plan to get this record to you! MOST IMPORTANTLY, I need your <b><i>FAITH IN ME!</i></b>  The FAITH being the money you put towards this endeavour! I want you to know the breakdown and understand it, so here it is followed by a more detailed explaination.</div>

<div>Damn straight! I have plowed these fields before! In 2009 I released my first bluegrass record called <i>""A Canary's Song""</i>. I received great reviews, got airplay on SiriuXM Radio as well as celestial stations and a lot of support from the bluegrass community.</div>
</div><div>

<div>
<h3>The Fruit For YOU!</h3>
</div>
<div>I have put together what I hope will be enticing and exciting rewards for all of you to get for your support! I want you to not only come away from this experience with a sense that you have helped start a successful career, but I want you to feel value in what you get as your initial rewards as well!

Now, let's MAKE it grow!

Why Plant THIS Seed??!!
My name is Kenny Ray Horton. I am an R.I.A.A. certified gold record awarded songwriter and country/bluegrass singer needing your help in the funding of my new record! With your support, recording will start in January 2016. The goal is to release the record by July of 2016. 
I have great musicians and music industry professionals ready to record, promote and market this record. The only thing stopping me right now is $25,000 to get this album recorded, packaged and marketed.
Clearing the Land! 
I am and have been serving in the United States Navy for 15 years. I am a singer and guitar player for the Navy's Premier Country and Bluegrass group, ""Country Current"", in Washington, DC.
After retirement from the Navy in 5 years, I will be able to focus full time on my music career. This gives me 5 years to prepare for that transition! Because of my opportunities and experiences in the Navy, I am a stronger writer, singer and performer and am more confident than ever!

I Had A Farm Before This!
Prior to the Navy, I was a staff songwriter in Nashville, TN and have had music recorded by Kenny Rogers and Donnie Osmond! Check out Kenny Rogers' album 'The Gift' - look for the track called ""A Soldier's King""! You'll see my name next to it! 
I have had the opportunity to record with some AMAZING musicians, such as Adam Steffey on mandolin (The Boxcars and Allison Krause & Union Station), Barry Bales on upright bass (Allison Krause & Union Station) and the incredible songwriter, Verlon Thompson (Guitar Player for Guy Clark and Writer of 'Boats To Build' by Jimmy Buffett and 'You Say You Will' by Trisha Yearwood), helping me write songs!

Planting the Crop!  
I'm humbled by the fact that there are many super talented folks involved with this project! To have folks willing to help an artist like me is amazing! To add YOU to that list would make it even more so!
Joining me by fully funding this campaign doesn't just get a record released and out there for sale, it launches my career!  I'm excited  for a new adventure and the successful funding of this record! I know the next 5 years will be filled with a lot of hard work towards a future career in music, but my experiences in Nashville and the Navy have prepared me for it and I'm ready to dive in!
   Harvest is $25,000 - Why??!!
 
Why do we need $25,000? Major record labels will spend millions to make and promote a record. Indie artists have learned that this can be done for a fraction of the cost. How can we do this? Because we don't spend money frivilously. 
Just getting a record out to the folks is a daunting task, even for an established artist! I will need a team to help me execute my marketing plan to get this record to you! MOST IMPORTANTLY, I need your FAITH IN ME!  The FAITH being the money you put towards this endeavour! I want you to know the breakdown and understand it, so here it is followed by a more detailed explaination.

***Studio, musicians, mixing and mastering - $12,000
***Photography and Album Artwork - $2000
***Duplication for single release - $1000
***Primary Album Duplication - $2000
***Promotional Materials and Social Media Marketing - $3000
***Video Production - $2000
***Record Release Event and Promotion - $1000

***Trade Magazine Ads, Live Event Booth Merch - $2000 
   Are You Sure I Can Grow A Crop!?
 
Damn straight! I have plowed these fields before! In 2009 I released my first bluegrass record called ""A Canary's Song"". I received great reviews, got airplay on SiriuXM Radio as well as celestial stations and a lot of support from the bluegrass community.



The Fruit For YOU!

I have put together what I hope will be enticing and exciting rewards for all of you to get for your support! I want you to not only come away from this experience with a sense that you have helped start a successful career, but I want you to feel value in what you get as your initial rewards as well! Please, take a look at them and see where you can fit into the successful funding of this campaign!

<p>Hi everyone!  My name is Abby Ward.  Although I'm only 14, I am a passionate and determined singer/songwriter.  I have loved and gravitated towards music as long as I can remember.  I feel like I started out singing rather than talking... probably not, but it feels that way!  My life has been challenging for a few different reasons.  I was born with congenital nystagmus (eye disorder) as well as DVM (delayed visual maturation) This condition created social challenges for me growing up and I was teased about my ""funny eyes""  Although hard, these experiences have helped me create the music that is constantly in my head.  LIfe is constantly revealing things to me,  which then comes out in the music I write.   I want to take part in being a voice for anti bullying, and I hope this campaign will allow me to do that.<br/></p>
<p>This campaign will also allow for me to finish my album, increase my chances for music marketing in film/T.V., tour with other musicians short term, and co-write with people in Nashville who have expressed interest.  All these things require funds that are not accessible right now, however,  music opportunities are available now, and I want to go after it.  I have so much inside of me, now I just want to share :)  Thanks for reading this and taking the time to check out my campaign.  I hope you can be an integral part of this musical journey! <br/>

We have worked hard, running the local circuit in Denver for the last 5 years. We have played with local bands as well as traveling nationals in Denver. We finally have our first album recorded so now it is time to go to the next level which would be touring it, and hopefully be able to make this band our lives.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>What we need s roughly 1500 dollars to rent a half way decent trailer, put gas in our van, and keep food in our stomachs. Essentially the money we are asking for isn't to put us on the tour because we are going regardless, it is to keep us alive and moving while we take this risk. A donation of $20 or more can get you a copy of our debut album ""To Live and Die in your Suit and Tie."" or a shirt or both or signed PDA swag, or an mention in the 2nd album we decide to record! (We will give you guys something cool if you donate less than $20)</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The honest truth as to why we need this, is because, like i have said before, this is our first time ever touring, it is a dream of ours to finally do it. You guys helping us achieve our goal gets us closer to becoming what we have always dreamed, a national act. In addition, your donations will also be greatly appreciated in the sense it will be keeping us fed, moving, and giving us a reliable trailer for our gear.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Our risks I have made pretty obvious. This our first ever tour opportunity we will have with it coms a lot of of risks. The biggest risk is that we play a dead show and not a lot of people show up to buy our merchandise and that will hinder our food and gas budget. With these donations we will stay moving and come home to Denver safely with our cars where we left them and a roof over our heads when we return. Another risk we are facing is staying fed and moving, with these donations it ensures we can survive our tour comfortably, $1500 seems low but it would be what we need because it is only a 2 week long trip, but the mileage is the only thing missing on our press kit, with the mileage we have a completed press kit that would be ready to submit to labels.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Husky Riders is the pet project of Record Producer/Audio Engineer/Musician Alexandre Moreira, from Portugal, and Safety in Numbers is the debut album. It was written during Alex's college years and it fuses all of his influences from classic Prog Rock to Electronic Music, from Rock to Metal, from Björk to Meshuggah. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This campaign is a home made solution to the need for a physical edition of this record. It took a long time and a lot of perseverance to complete this record and it seems fitting to have a small printing of it to commemorate this first step! With your help this can become a reality. Each donation above 15€ (20€ outside Europe) equates a copy of the record printed! This means that, although there is a goal in mind, there is no actual limit for the amount of money we raise since everyone is paying for their own copy of the record! On the other hand, any donation at all is a huge help and an investment in publicity and future records.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This is a very exciting age where virtually anyone who can get their hands on a computer and some gear can make a great sounding record. What enables that is the internet. It's YOU! Every single person who takes the time to support their local bands directly. You're empowering a whole generation of musicians and song-writers and we're very thankful for that!</p>
<p><br/></p>As previously stated, all the money made from this crowdfunding, however much or little, will: 1) print out however many copies, 2) help fund future records and fuel the success of this project!<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Why crowdfunding?</h3>
<div>As stated previously, crowdfunding is an immensely powerful tool. As some of you may know, the music industry used to revolve around record companies and managers and record producers, and the bands seemed to be incidental, a product to be marketed, just like any other. Bands had little or no control on the money they made, how it was invested back, where it was spent and who earned most of it. With the advent of the internet things changed for the better and now bands can finally dictate how best to approach their fans, how much money they actually need to put out records and how to earn that money! </div>
<div>This is very important for projects like this one: studio-driven, focused mostly on song-writing and special guest appearances. A project of this nature has a harder time finding concerts and other money-earning gigs, so crowdfunding means we get some money back for our countless hours of work and (in some cases) hundreds of dollars spent on musician fees, studio time and such. </div>
<div>Thanks for everyday Joes like you and I, we get to do what we love and (hopefully) get paid for it!</div>

take care of our artists without whom all of our enjoyment in this blissful thing we call trance music simply wouldn't be possible. But when of our most known artist doesn't
produce anything for 2+ years and when we ask him what is the reason? We would
always get a response: “Too tired to do anything”. It means something is wrong.Couple weeks ago, Raytheon got fired from his job on his birthday,
and this is when we knew we had to help this guy somehow. A guy that is totally
down to earth, with this God given talent which is getting wasted due to long
working hours, and a pile of stress day after day, wondering if he will be able
to feed his family.This is why we have decided to help
