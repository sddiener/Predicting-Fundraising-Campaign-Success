<h3>Summary</h3>
<p><strong>""Bloody Holiday""</strong> is a photography project about the refugee crisis. We are asking for your support to <strong>pre-finance</strong> a<strong> </strong>photography exhibition and a photobook to raise funds and awareness for <strong>OXFAM ""Stand Together"" </strong>campaign for the refugees. The profits from the sale of the photos and books will go to providing water for displaced families in Syria and in the refugee camps of Lebanon and Jordan : </p>
<ul>
<li>I'm Francois Marmion, I have done a <strong>photo-reportage</strong> last year about the <strong>refugees </strong>arriving in the Greek Islands from Syria, Irak and other countries and war zones, </li>
<li>I met and interviewed many refugees and shared their personal stories. I have travelled a lot around the world but, from a human standpoint, this was the <strong>toughest </strong>experience in my life, </li>
<li>I also investigated the role of social media in the crisis, particularly with regards to on-line smuggling. Refugees themselves encouraged me to talk about this situation,</li>
<li>The refugees were landing in the middle of highly touristy islands but never really met the tourists. This is why I chose to describe the situation of the refugees <strong>with the words of tourism</strong> and on-line bookings... A powerful way to understand what their daily life was and to think about our own standards in life and our perception of the refugees, </li>
<li>With Leonore Saintville and Olivier Bertin at Balthaz'Art, we dedided to organize an exhibition on this topic in order to raise awareness and funds for <strong>OXFAM </strong>and their campaign for the refugees, ""Stand together"" (the money will go to providing clean water for the refugees),</li>
<li>However, this is very costly to publish a book and to produce the framed pictures and we do not have the budget for that, </li>
<li>This is where we need <strong>your help to pre-finance the production </strong>of the art pieces and the printing of the book,</li>
<li>The <strong>profits </strong>from the sale of the book and the pictures will go to OXFAM for the refugees.<br/> </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We need at least £6,500 to be able to organise the exhibition and to publish the book. This might sound a lot but this is the buget to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>image printing, framing and mounting (the major cost involved here),</li>
<li>posters and postcards printing,</li>
<li>book publishing (the second higher cost)</li>
<li>and venue costs. </li>
</ul>
<p>Once we have produced all these materials, we will be able to sell them with all the profits going to Oxfam's campaign for the refugees <strong>""Stand together""</strong>.<br/> </p>
<h3>What You Get - Perks</h3>
<p>We have a wide range of <strong>perks for all budgets</strong>, from a simple set of postcards to large picture prints and private visit. One of the key items that you can buy is the book of the reportage, Bloody Holiday. </p>
<p>We truly need your help to pre-finance the exhibition and the publishing of the book. Without your support, we won't be able to help Oxfam and the refugees will miss your contribution, particularly children in need for clean water, shelter and school.</p>
<p><strong>A precision about delivery of the perks:</strong> when you buy the perks you can receive them by post, then you have to give your adress and pay shipping fees. If you want to collect your perks on the opening night of the exhibition, please put Aaland Island as shipping location and then your normal address - we use this little trick since Indiegogo does not do optional shipping.<br/><br/>Here are the various perks that you can get:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Signed photographies:</strong></li></ul>
<p>Pictures come in three sizes: 20x30cm, 40x60cm and 56x84cm.</p>
<p>To order your picture:</p>
<ol>
<li>Chose the perk according to the size you want (see column on the right)</li>
<li>Pay for the perk</li>
<li>Then, you can have any of the pictures in the photo gallery below the video that has a sale number # (look at the title underneath the pictures) </li>
<li>Write me an e-mail at frmarmion@gmail.com mentioning your name, the size and the sale number of the picture that you have chosen, so that we can print the exact picture that you want</li>
</ol>
<p>For the Christmas Special signed photographies (format 20x30 cm), the two pictures that you can get are the two on the right below. The picture with the wall, name ""Laundry Service"" shows a wall where the refugee dry up their wet jeans in the sun after crossing from Turkey to Greece. But it isn't any wall. It is the wall of the Caste of the Knights of St-John in Kos, a castle built at the time of the crusades, showing us that history strikes back and back again in these eastern mediterranean places. The other picture ""No one is illegal"" is a graffiti in the streets of Kos, at a time where there was a deep divide in the Greek population about what to do about the refugees.</p>

Not even including the life jacket... <br/><br/>For this amount you get: the private visit + 5 photobooks Bloody Holidays signed by the author + a signed photography 40x60cm framed.</li>

<p>Please note that:</p>
<ul><li>If we don't reach the entire goal, donators will get their perks (books, photos, postcards). For the books though, we will need at least ten backers to be able to print them, if not, backers will be reimbursed. If we don't raise enough money, we might not be able to organise the exhibition and we will miss our goal to help Oxfam. This is why we need your help !!!! However, the profits on the perks, whatever they will be, will go to Oxfam. <br/> </li></ul>

<p>Our contribution to the OXFAM's Stand together campaign for the refugees will go to OXFAM's <strong>projects in Syria and in the neighbouring countries such a Lebanon and Jordan</strong>, where millions of Syrians have found shelter.</p>
<p>Oxfam has had an office <strong>inside Syria</strong> since July 2013, responding alongside other agencies to the urgent need for clean water. An estimated 35% of water treatment plants in Syria have been damaged during the conflict and there are concerns over water contamination.</p>
<p>Since 2013 Oxfam has helped ensure 2.8 million people <strong>have access to clean, safe water</strong>, by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making sure the local water systems run,</li>
<li>Installing water tanks in schools and teaching the children good hygiene,</li>
<li>Improving sewage systems.</li>

<p><i>65 tons of water and sanitation equipment sent to Syria </i></p>
<p>Oxfam is working primarily to make sure people have enough clean water, and are able to keep themselves clean and healthy:</p>
<ul>
<li>in <strong>Damascus </strong>- OXFAM has brought two water treatment plants back on-line using multiple truck-sized generators, capable of continuously pumping more than 700,000 extra litres of water per hour - enough to deliver safe water to around 500,000 people in Damascus city and the surrounding province<br/> </li>
<li>in <strong>Aleppo </strong>- the Suleiman Al-Halabi water pumping station is the main water source for Aleppo city, and Oxfam is committed to keeping the generator, which they previously installed, operational. Water pumped from here reaches beneficiaries across conflict lines. Oxfam  has had a second huge generator manufactured and, depending on security and access, plan to install it to increase the capacity of water delivered to the Aleppo population of perhaps 1.5 million people.<br/> </li>
<li>in <strong>Hama</strong>, the equipping of the Lwebde pumping station has been completed, facilitating the supply of clean water to 133,000 conflict affected people. The security situation continues to make operations very challenging.</li>
</ul>
<div>I am particularly happy that the money would go to water for Syrians because one of the refugees I met in Kos and with whom I am still in touch is a Syrian water treatment engineer. He was made prisoner by the so-called Islamic State because he worked for the government and he manage to get away. He is now in Germany but I am sure he would appreciate to know that thanks to my pictures, we might get some improvement for the water systems and the Syrian people. <br/> </div>
<p>Oxfam is also active with the Syrian refugees in the neighbouring countries:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>in <strong>Jordan </strong>- Oxfam work in Za'atari refugee camp, where about 80,000 Syrian refugees are housed, and in Jordanian communities where Syrian refugees are hosted. Oxfam  helps provide water to Za'atari's 12 districts, constructs toilets, and manages waste and the cleaning and maintenance of wash blocks. They also help teach good hygiene in the camp. They have constructed more than 300 septic tanks for better waste management, installed 75 private toilets for vulnerable families and built a water tank at the Syrian border to give 45,000 people there access to water<br/> </p>

<li><p>in <strong>Lebanon </strong>- Oxfam has reached more than 250,000 vulnerable people in Lebanon. They have provided 3,200 hygiene kits, along with lessons on good hygiene, and toilet cleaning kits, built or repaired over 1,100 toilets, ensuring that each is shared by no more than 20 people and delivered 10 million litres of water through water trucking - meaning people can get clean water for drinking, cooking and washing.</p></li>

</div></div>","Summary
""Bloody Holiday"" is a photography project about the refugee crisis. We are asking for your support to pre-finance a photography exhibition and a photobook to raise funds and awareness for OXFAM ""Stand Together"" campaign for the refugees. The profits from the sale of the photos and books will go to providing water for displaced families in Syria and in the refugee camps of Lebanon and Jordan : 

I'm Francois Marmion, I have done a photo-reportage last year about the refugees arriving in the Greek Islands from Syria, Irak and other countries and war zones, 
I met and interviewed many refugees and shared their personal stories. I have travelled a lot around the world but, from a human standpoint, this was the toughest experience in my life, 
I also investigated the role of social media in the crisis, particularly with regards to on-line smuggling. Refugees themselves encouraged me to talk about this situation,
The refugees were landing in the middle of highly touristy islands but never really met the tourists. This is why I chose to describe the situation of the refugees with the words of tourism and on-line bookings... A powerful way to understand what their daily life was and to think about our own standards in life and our perception of the refugees, 
With Leonore Saintville and Olivier Bertin at Balthaz'Art, we dedided to organize an exhibition on this topic in order to raise awareness and funds for OXFAM and their campaign for the refugees, ""Stand together"" (the money will go to providing clean water for the refugees),
However, this is very costly to publish a book and to produce the framed pictures and we do not have the budget for that, 
This is where we need your help to pre-finance the production of the art pieces and the printing of the book,
The profits from the sale of the book and the pictures will go to OXFAM for the refugees. 


What We Need
We need at least £6,500 to be able to organise the exhibition and to publish the book. This might sound a lot but this is the buget to cover:

image printing, framing and mounting (the major cost involved here),
posters and postcards printing,
book publishing (the second higher cost)
and venue costs. 

Once we have produced all these materials, we will be able to sell them with all the profits going to Oxfam's campaign for the refugees ""Stand together"". 
What You Get - Perks
We have a wide range of perks for all budgets, from a simple set of postcards to large picture prints and private visit. One of the key items that you can buy is the book of the reportage, Bloody Holiday. 
We truly need your help to pre-finance the exhibition and the publishing of the book. Without your support, we won't be able to help Oxfam and the refugees will miss your contribution, particularly children in need for clean water, shelter and school.
A precision about delivery of the perks: when you buy the perks you can receive them by post, then you have to give your adress and pay shipping fees. If you want to collect your perks on the opening night of the exhibition, please put Aaland Island as shipping location and then your normal address - we use this little trick since Indiegogo does not do optional shipping.Here are the various perks that you can get:
Signed photographies:
Pictures come in three sizes: 20x30cm, 40x60cm and 56x84cm.
To order your picture:

Chose the perk according to the size you want (see column on the right)
Pay for the perk
Then, you can have any of the pictures in the photo gallery below the video that has a sale number # (look at the title underneath the pictures) 
Write me an e-mail at frmarmion@gmail.com mentioning your name, the size and the sale number of the picture that you have chosen, so that we can print the exact picture that you want

For the Christmas Special signed photographies (format 20x30 cm), the two pictures that you can get are the two on the right below. The picture with the wall, name ""Laundry Service"" shows a wall where the refugee dry up their wet jeans in the sun after crossing from Turkey to Greece. But it isn't any wall. It is the wall of the Caste of the Knights of St-John in Kos, a castle built at the time of the crusades, showing us that history strikes back and back again in these eastern mediterranean places. The other picture ""No one is illegal"" is a graffiti in the streets of Kos, at a time where there was a deep divide in the Greek population about what to do about the refugees.

Fine art pictures by Francois Marmion:
We are conscious that you might not want to buy of picture of the refugee crisis for your home or for a gift. Therefore, we sell fine art pictures from Francois Marmion to finance the exhibition about the refugees. The market value of these 40x60cm pictures is usually around £300-350. They are heavily discouted here to help with the project.

Chose an image in that gallery 
Write me an e-mail at frmarmion@gmail.com mentioning your name and  the picture that you have chosen, so that we can print the exact picture that you want 

A set of five postcards (with messages from refugees on the back) for £20: 

 
an A3 poster of the photo exhibition ""Bloody Holiday"" - A3 for £25:

 
The photobook ""Bloody Holiday"", 100 pages with photographies and illustrations, that you can get for £35. The book was shortlisted at the Kassel photo book dummy festival in June 2016 in Germany. This book is graphically design as a parody of a tourist brochure to make us think about what is it to live the life of a refugee.

 
 
More complete than the photobook alone, the whole ""Bloody Holiday"" package (below) is the original way the author wanted to present his work, the concept being a parody of the packages provided by tour operators. It does includes the book, a set of 5 postcards messages from refugees, a map of Kos with the index of all the pictures in the book and 3 ""excursions"" flyers explaining the money made by the smugglers, all this for £55. 

 


Private visit with the authorWe will plan with you for a private 1h30mn visit for a group of 5 persons - within the opening hours of the gallery - with personal comments and discussion with the photographer, followed by a drink at the gallery.  In addition to the visit, ou will get 1 whole Bloody Holiday package including: the photobook ""Bloody Holiday"" signed by the author, a set of 5 refugee postcards, a set of 3 flyers explaining the money made by the smugglers, and a map with an index of all the pictures, given to you during the private visit. 

For the price of a lifeIf you really want to support OXFAM strongly this is the one! £1,100 is a very symbolic amount.This is on average what adult refugees had to pay during the summer of 2015 to cross the sea from Turkey to Greece on an inflatable boat. Not even including the life jacket... For this amount you get: the private visit + 5 photobooks Bloody Holidays signed by the author + a signed photography 40x60cm framed.

Please note that:
If we don't reach the entire goal, donators will get their perks (books, photos, postcards). For the books though, we will need at least ten backers to be able to print them, if not, backers will be reimbursed. If we don't raise enough money, we might not be able to organise the exhibition and we will miss our goal to help Oxfam. This is why we need your help !!!! However, the profits on the perks, whatever they will be, will go to Oxfam.  

A direct impact thanks to your donation

promotional costs of <i>The Great Mother
Bible</i>, a book that <i>Gaia/Earth Mother</i> specifically asked me in November
2013, to write with her (and the Great Divine Mother). <br/></p>
<p><b><i></i></b></p><p><b><i></i></b>
</p><p><b><i>What is </i>The Great Mother Bible<i>
About?</i></b></p>
<p>The Great Mother Bible
is a series of conversations between Mother and myself, similar to Neal Donald
Walsch’s Conversations with God
series. This profound and unique <i>Bible</i> offers Earth Mother's story on how Western society went
 off course several thousand years ago in denying the Sacred Feminine, 
and offers spiritual wisdom to help usher in the New World being born 
presently.<br/></p><p>In the course of writing this book the Great Divine Mother came
through to communicate with me initially, which was quite humbling. She introduced
herself and then passed it over to Earth Mother, explaining that she would be
speaking through Earth Mother part of the time. I could discern the difference
between the two of them. </p>
<p>Mother speaks about the Quantum Divine Love that surrounds
us all the time, and how we exist in a multi-verse of energy and
consciousnesses. Our cultural conditioning has led us astray from the balance
and harmony we’re supposed to be experiencing here on Earth. She discusses the
role of aliens on our culture and dominant religions. She also laments how few
people seek to connect with her and is rather opinionated about many of our
actions here on her in these ‘interesting’ times. </p>
<p>Mother encourages us to shed the fear-based illusions of our society and open our hearts up to the Christ
Consciousness and deep compassion. More than anything though, she repeatedly
talks about how much love she has for us. She wants
us to remember who she is as Earth Mother. She is hard-wired to heal and we
need to help her. There is so much more beyond that. This is truly a book to
complement the “Great Father” Bible
that we all grew up with. Some excerpts can be found <a href=""http://messagesfrommother.org/the-great-mother-bible-excerpts/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a> along with the

about the spiritual listening and writing I do. I have been gifted with the
capability to communicate directly with Earth Mother, the ancient consciousness
who is our planetary caretaker. I have recently been called “The Voice of Earth
Mother” by a rather gifted Native elder. <br/><br/><p>In addition, I’m a multi-award-winning author and nature mystic with an
environmental background. My spiritual studies include more than 18 years with Native
American teachers along with authoring two books prior to this one: <a href=""http://www.tocallgod.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i></i></a><i><a href=""http://www.tocallgod.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">If I gave you God’s phone number....

<p></p>
<p><b></b>
</p><p><b><i>About Earth Mother</i></b></p>
Yes, Earth Mother does exist. She is very ancient, more
ancient than our planet. As a powerful spiritual being, she was assigned to
Earth to coordinate evolution co-creatively with Creation and all the other
spiritual beings here on this planet. Her work far extends that also. Just
because our Western culture has denied her existence for thousands of years
does not mean she does not exist. Medicine people all over the world have been
communicating with her for thousands of years.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1249655/files/20150225171041-302707_425958834124458_1969867430_n-1.jpg?1424913041"" src="""" style=""width: 265.894px; height: 249px;""/></p><br/><p><b><i>Surrendering to Mother</i></b></p>
<p>In June, 2012, just days after being diagnosed with
lymphoma, I was asked to participate in a small and powerful ceremony for Earth
Mother with a gifted Algonquin medicine man. She specifically requested that we
do this ceremony together and told him that it would help her with her healing.
<br/></p><p>Shortly after the ceremony for Earth Mother in early
June, 2012, I started to communicate very clearly with her and agreed to surrender to her. This was how <i><a href=""http://messagesfrommother.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a></i><a href=""http://messagesfrommother.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Messages from Mother.... Earth Mother </a>was written in only five
weeks during the summer of 2012. Several gifted Native elders have confirmed I am closely
connected with Earth Mother. <br/>
</p><p>Then in November 2013, Mother woke me up at 5 AM and told me
that I was not to move out to Washington State. Instead she wanted me to stay
in the house I was renting (and about to go into foreclosure) and write <i>The Great Mother Bible</i>. This book has been her idea from the inception. </p><p><b><i>Early Praise for </i>The

<p></p><br/><p><b><i>My Campaign Goals</i></b></p>
<p>For the past three and a half years, I have been living
primarily off my savings which has shrunk by more than two-thirds, to focus on
writing for Mother and heal from lymphoma. <br/></p>
<p>Publishing a book independently isn't cheap. It cost me
$6500 in 2012 to produce <i>Messages from
Mother.... Earth Mother</i>. This does not include any of the extensive
promotional expenses. After giving retailers, wholesalers and distributors
their cut (and paying for printing costs), I earn about $4.47 per
paperback sold. That means I have to sell a lot of books just to break even.
Your pledge will reduce the financial risk I'm taking to publish <i>The Great Mother Bible</i>.</p>
<p>As of late February, 2015. I have completed the manuscript, published the ebook (<a href=""http://amzn.to/16HxcEd"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kindle</a> and other formats available), and the hard copy book is in the final design stages. To date, I’ve put more than $6200
into book production expenses (which includes editors, graphic designers, and hiring a gifted
artist to do the painting on the front cover, per Mother’s instructions). <br/></p>
<p><i>I’m about to expend an
additional $3425 for printing 1000 books, and seek your support in this. </i></p>
<p>Then there are the book promotion expenses, which are not
insignificant. Mother wants me to take the book as an official Autographing
Author to the premier publishing event in the nation - the Book Expo of America,
in New York City in late May. The autographing slot fee is $795, and that does not
include traveling, lodging, meals or the cost of the books themselves, as I’ll
be giving away 150 copies (approx $750). She also wants me to take the book to the International New Age Trade Show in Denver, June 2015.<br/></p>
<p>This book has the potential to influence readers’ spiritual lives in
the same way as Neale Donald Walsch’s <i>Conversations
with God</i> series, <b><i>yet in a way that embraces the Divine
Feminine and helps us heal our relationship with our planet.</i> </b></p>
<p>Also, this book is a launching platform for the “Great
Mother Wisdom Gathering” that was first held in fall of 2014 and will continue
annually.</p>
<p>In addition, Earth Mother has given me the vision of
creating a <i>Great Mother Center for Love and Healing</i>. This seed funding will
help manifest this greater vision to create a healing center built on
sustainability principles and the great healing love of the Mother in all her
myriad archetypes.</p>

<br/></div>","You are invited to support the printing and initial
promotional costs of The Great Mother
Bible, a book that Gaia/Earth Mother specifically asked me in November
2013, to write with her (and the Great Divine Mother). 

What is The Great Mother Bible
About?
The Great Mother Bible
is a series of conversations between Mother and myself, similar to Neal Donald
Walsch’s Conversations with God
series. This profound and unique Bible offers Earth Mother's story on how Western society went
 off course several thousand years ago in denying the Sacred Feminine, 
and offers spiritual wisdom to help usher in the New World being born 
presently.In the course of writing this book the Great Divine Mother came
through to communicate with me initially, which was quite humbling. She introduced
herself and then passed it over to Earth Mother, explaining that she would be
speaking through Earth Mother part of the time. I could discern the difference
between the two of them. 
Mother speaks about the Quantum Divine Love that surrounds
us all the time, and how we exist in a multi-verse of energy and
consciousnesses. Our cultural conditioning has led us astray from the balance
and harmony we’re supposed to be experiencing here on Earth. She discusses the
role of aliens on our culture and dominant religions. She also laments how few
people seek to connect with her and is rather opinionated about many of our
actions here on her in these ‘interesting’ times. 
Mother encourages us to shed the fear-based illusions of our society and open our hearts up to the Christ
Consciousness and deep compassion. More than anything though, she repeatedly
talks about how much love she has for us. She wants
us to remember who she is as Earth Mother. She is hard-wired to heal and we
need to help her. There is so much more beyond that. This is truly a book to
complement the “Great Father” Bible
that we all grew up with. Some excerpts can be found here along with the
full “Table of Contents”. About MareIt has taken me several years to feel comfortable being open
about the spiritual listening and writing I do. I have been gifted with the
capability to communicate directly with Earth Mother, the ancient consciousness
who is our planetary caretaker. I have recently been called “The Voice of Earth
Mother” by a rather gifted Native elder. In addition, I’m a multi-award-winning author and nature mystic with an
environmental background. My spiritual studies include more than 18 years with Native
American teachers along with authoring two books prior to this one: If I gave you God’s phone number.... Searching for Spirituality in America and Messages from Mother.... Earth Mother.


About Earth Mother
Yes, Earth Mother does exist. She is very ancient, more
ancient than our planet. As a powerful spiritual being, she was assigned to
Earth to coordinate evolution co-creatively with Creation and all the other
spiritual beings here on this planet. Her work far extends that also. Just
because our Western culture has denied her existence for thousands of years
does not mean she does not exist. Medicine people all over the world have been
communicating with her for thousands of years.Surrendering to Mother
In June, 2012, just days after being diagnosed with
lymphoma, I was asked to participate in a small and powerful ceremony for Earth
Mother with a gifted Algonquin medicine man. She specifically requested that we
do this ceremony together and told him that it would help her with her healing.
Shortly after the ceremony for Earth Mother in early
June, 2012, I started to communicate very clearly with her and agreed to surrender to her. This was how Messages from Mother.... Earth Mother was written in only five
weeks during the summer of 2012. Several gifted Native elders have confirmed I am closely
connected with Earth Mother. 
Then in November 2013, Mother woke me up at 5 AM and told me
that I was not to move out to Washington State. Instead she wanted me to stay
in the house I was renting (and about to go into foreclosure) and write The Great Mother Bible. This book has been her idea from the inception. Early Praise for The
Great Mother Bible
“Mare Cromwell has
been given a gift. The gift of wisdom, words, and the ability to hear the Great
Mother. For spiritual seekers everywhere, I predict The Great Mother Bible will become a fixture in your library.”               — Nancy Mills, Founder - TheSpiritedWoman.com
“This book will

relationship with the Great Mother offers a dialogue that is witty, wise and
comical. Mare writes about ""unseen forces"" but her luminous accounts
bring a lucidity and reality to their insights that are uplifting, intriguing,
and wondrous.”

encourage humanity to awaken their hearts and find peace in these struggling
times. The world will find these sacred writings most brilliant.”

Mops’s journey began nearly 10 years ago and we are asking YOU to be a part of the story to help us publish and share Mops (and la vie en rose) throughout the world!WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN FOR MOPS TO REIGN THE WORLD?It's our DREAM to see Mops published and ready for purchase at your local bookstore or online marketplace!  We just need a little help to get there and this is where YOU come in...Our crowdfunding campaign has three stretch goals, each which will get us closer to putting a physical book into your or your child’s hands! You can either ""back"" or ""make a contribution"" to our campaign with any amount of your choosing or select a ""perk"" to receive a signed illustration  or chance to be drawn into the story!Our first goal is to make $8,000! This will help us complete a “dummy"" (mock-up) that we can send off to agents and publishers.  This will consist of 32 sketches in black and white, as well as the graphics and text placed into the pages.Our second goal is a big one, but the ultimate DREAM to achieve... it’s $35,000!  This will help us complete the final book, cover to cover. That’s with 32 fully illustrated pages, graphics, text, the works! Hitting this target will allow any publisher or ourselves to send the book off to the printers!Our final goal is any amount over $35k, which will help us self-publish in case we’re not signed by a publisher. For example, $45,000 will allow us to have 1000 hardback copies printed!HOW TO GET INVOLVED AND HAVE A CHANCE OF BEING IN THE BOOK!Gaining your support, whether it’s $2, $20, or even an IG repost would mean the world to us (and Mops!) We have some amazing opportunities for you... such as the chance for yourself or your pet to be drawn right into Mops and The Royal Rulebook! That's right! We have several ""perk"" options available to choose from and start at $150 which gives you an ""extra"" role in Mops (think royal staff or town goer) A $300 contribution is a ""supporting role"" where you'll stand out a bit more from the crowd (like a party guest!) For $500 you or your pet will be a ""guest star"" and considered a part of Mops and Marie's in-crowd (tea or hide-and-seek, anyone?) And finally, for a contribution of $800 you or your pet will be a ""leading star"" in Mops! You'll get one-on-one time with Mops and Marie, and an entire page to yourselves!We're also giving you the chance to donate for a signed Nathanna Erica illustration which will be sent to you in the post, while EVERY SINGLE BACKER will receive a digital sticker pack for iMessage or WhatsApp as a special thanks for your contribution!THIS SOUNDS AWESOME! CAN I READ THE BOOK? Absolument! Watch the video below to hear the entire story of Mops and The Royal Rulebook!WHEN YOU REACH YOUR GOAL, HOW WILL MOPS TAKE ON THE WORLD?Getting a physical book in your hands is only the beginning!  Nathanna Erica is often busy with a certain mouse and while illustrations will not resume until the end of 2021, the graphics and calligraphy will be completed beforehand in the Fall. Depending on the goal we reach, we anticipate the ""dummy"" to be complete by mid-2022, or the final book ready to print in 2023.We have all kinds of ideas for merchandise (stuffed animals, stationary, clothing) and epic launch parties like the good ole' Harry Potter days (but instead of wizards, there will be pugs!) We also dream of an animated tv series, and even have sequels for the book already in mind!Please read our FAQ’s if you have any more questions or concerns.  If you don’t see your question addressed, or if you’re a literary agent or publisher who wants a piece of the cake (believe us, you want a piece of the cake) then email us at MopsAndTheRoyalRulebook@gmail.comMERCI x",9.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Away Away is A.E. (April) Spiller's first book. It's an adventure about teenage twins Abbie and Lane who discover a plot to take over Galveston while their parents are out of town. With the routes off of the island being taken out one by one, they are faced with an impossible decision- stay and risk imprisonment, or steal a boat and head out into the Gulf of Mexico. They ultimately decide to battle the elements in an attempt to make it to safety in time to warn their parents.</p>
<p>As an engineer and then a high school teacher, April Spiller has been sailing the waters of Galveston and the Gulf of Mexico since college. In her first book, she wanted to create an adventure that the whole family could enjoy, while hopefully inspiring our next generation to get out there and explore.</p>
<p>As a teacher, April has witnessed the attachment kids these days have with their phones. With the entire world literally at their fingertips, most of her students still preferred using their phones to chat with people in their same school rather than looking to the world around them. She decided that she wanted to write stories that open their eyes to the fact that they can do more and really get out there instead of staying focused on the 5 inch screen in front of them. </p>
<p>It wasn't much of a stretch for her to imagine two teens adventuring on the high seas, since sailing has been one of her obsessions since college. Adventures on the high seas have been common for many many years, what is new about this book is that it is centered around two teenagers with only a little sailing experience, alone on a sailboat. It follows their exploits through winter storms at sea as well as the threat of piracy and the trouble they get into when they accidentally find themselves in Cuban waters.</p>
<p>Away Away is a fun read for anyone who has ever thought about sailing off into the sunset and for anyone who dreams of adventure. It's an exciting look at how two kids escape military capture and the monotony of high school.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This campaign is to help cover the costs of getting Away Away released and in bookstores. Spiller previously self-published Away Away on Amazon, but with very little marketing experience, she wasn't very successful in getting the book to her target audience. The book is being pulled from Amazon and published by Sistership Publishing.</p>
<p>Here are some of the costs we are hoping to get covered through crowd-funding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Editing, Cover Design and Formatting ($950)</li>
<li>Printing- 200 copies for review and initial release ($1002)</li>
<li>Launch ($1500)</li>
<li>Promotional items for crowdfunding, launch and advertising ($1000)</li>
<li>Imprinted sea beans as give-away items ($250)</li>
<li>GoPro for YouTube and blog videos- for Away Away and future books in the series ($400)</li>
</ul>
<p>We estimate that all together, we will need $5102 for the launch of Away Away. If we don't make our entire goal, the money will go toward the most necessary items first, like editing and cover design, and will then be stretched as far as we can stretch it to get as much covered as we can.</p>
<p>If we exceed our goal, the funds will be put toward future books in the Away Away series and in our other projects and toward beefing up our marketing programs so that we can build a better company and help more authors.</p>
<p>To make our campaign interesting, we are putting together really exciting perks. Of course we will have the standard free books, and ebooks, but we will also have other, more unique perks, like mugs, printed sea beans, handmade reading quilts, and more.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Sistership Publishing is a different kind of publishing company. As authors ourselves, we know how much of their time and emotions authors invest in their books. Authors spend countless hours getting attached to their books, only to have them taken away as soon as a contract is signed, with publishers changing story lines, characters, even names without any input from the authors at all. What's worse is that authors receive advances, but those advances have to be paid back. They are like the payday loans of the artistic world. </p>
<p>At Sistership, we want authors to be involved every step of the way and for them to retain creative control of their books and characters. We don't want them to do all the work only to end up with a measly 15% of the profits- as is the current industry standard. </p>
<p>Contributing to this campaign will let us get our first of many books out onto the literary market and will permit us to begin expanding our publishing services to more authors. You are not just funding a really fun adventure book. You are funding something bigger.</p>
<p>Who knows, you may be funding your own future creative endeavors by helping us get off the ground.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>At this point you may be asking yourself why you should bother funding someone's first book or a publishing company's first efforts to break into a stale market.</p>
<p>Sistership Publishing was started by April Spiller (yes, the same April Spiller who wrote Away Away), her sister, Pam Spiller, and their friend, Diane McCloskey, who is already an established author. As three highly motivated women, we each bring unique skill sets to the table, and we are all committed to bringing Sistership Publishing onto the world stage. We all have vested interests in making the company a success and know what other authors are going through while trying to navigate the shark infested waters of traditional publishing.</p>
<p>We understand that there are challenges, but with our experience and stubborn unwillingness to quit, we are confident that together, we can make this work.</p>

<p>After fifteen years working in food and beverage I'm hitting the road! For those of you that know me well, working in bars and restaurants has been my life. Over that time I have developed some incredible relationships on both sides of the industry. Whether it was working with our staff and customers or running the beverage program(s) and meeting the suppliers and actual people making the products we all enjoy. I've been fortunate to share some great experiences locally in New York at breweries, distilleries and the like and now want to share these experiences with everyone across the country. Next time you plan a trip, let Boozy Excursions add something fun and different to your itinerary. </p>

<h3>Boozy Budget</h3>
<p>I could probably just Google search everything, do some online questionnaire and find out generic information about each location along the route. That wouldn't be much for anyone here. Instead I am packing up and driving thousands of miles to meet the people who make it all possible. This campaign is to help create awareness for the book and help cover the costs of printing, editing, promotion, and other expenses along the way. More funding equals better content and coverage for the reader. </p>

<p>Not everyone will be able to contribute financially, and that's perfectly alright. I'll be out on the road for a few months, often traveling solo. Send along some messages of encouragement.

<p>Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia (the country, not the US state!) is a perfect chaos! Only here you will find the surreal mixture of megalomaniac futuristic architecture, soviet brutalism, buildings from the times of Russian empire, Ottoman style baths, Persian carpets hanging on the walls of the dining halls, centuries old churches, bizarre bazaars, racing taxi drivers, elderly street players of backgammon... The hipsters and ravers mingle on the streets with the orthodox priests and their conservative followers.

<h3>Who are we? </h3>
<p>We are a creative collective based in Tbilisi, Georgia. We have published our first <a href=""https://www.use-it-tbilisi.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">USE-IT Tbilisi</a> map in November 2015 and it was a huge success. We couldn’t even respond all the messages of our fans writing us how many awesome places they could enjoy thanks to our map and and how they loved our playful design. (but we indeed tried) :) Today, the first map is outdated, because Tbilisi changes so fast that a place that was a total hype one season, sinks into oblivion a year later. That’s why we are working hard to publish a new map and save the travellers from awkward situations, tourist traps and confused crowds of organised tours. </p>
<p>We cooperate with a Georgian non-governmental organisation called Youth Association DRONI, which works with and for young people, mainly those with fewer opportunities (refugees, young people from marginalised areas and communities), helps them to learn new skills, develop and get experiences that they cannot learn in educational institutions. The young people are involved in creating the content, design and promoting this map. We have loads of ideas and energy, only thing we lack is enough funding to print 30 thousand copies of the maps, which will make so many travellers happy!</p>

<h3>Our project: USE-IT Tbilisi</h3>
<p>We want to promote smart and sustainable way of exploring our city! In recent years Tbilisi has developed into a buzzing touristic destination where people from East and West, South and North meet and mingle. But still, there are many who have never heard of us or are afraid to visit! Based on our experience with our 2015 map and positive feedback from some of the travellers who were encouraged to explore Georgia on their own after finding Tbilisi on the network’s website, we decided that for the biggest impact of our map and promotion of the city, we want to stay a member of international USE-IT.travel family. </p>
<p>We simply love the concept of free, noncommercial, no non-sense maps targeting mainly young travellers and backpackers, but also anyone who has a bit adventurous soul and wants to move around the city by public transportation, understand the rules of traditional Georgian supra and know the inside stories and urban legends. We need your help to achieve our goal! And if you decide to visit us yourself and try our map on your own, you will see that this was not a wasted investment. </p>

<h2>THE STORY</h2>
<p><i>Same Sins Separate Path,</i> a 98,000-word fiction novel is the story of Titus Wilcox, the countrified brother from Beaufort South Carolina who enters wondrously into the corrupt world of Wilfred Grimes (CArJAk), the brash, jive talking, city slicker from Baltimore Maryland.</p>
<p>When Paps flees the backwoods of the Low Country, the only recourse for the remaining Wilcox clan is a journey to higher ground. A gig in Baltimore finally comes through for Aretha Wilcox, inciting the family's new beginning. Once on scene, Titus learns just how far behind the curve he really is when he crosses the path of CArJAk, a foolhardy ""Merliner"" whose life is plummeting toward an inevitably bad conclusion. Owed to some imperceptible force, out of some indiscernible need, the two are unified into a friendship bond that requires costly sacrifices. As the bare essence of CArJAk's hard luck existence unravels, Titus, who is still licking fresh and painful wounds of his own, is duty-bound to set his homie on a straight and narrow path. Amassing all efforts to stave off the inevitable devastation that follows CArJAk like death s dark shadow, Titus finds himself dangerously caught up into his friends vacuum of despair.</p>
<h2>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</h2>
<p>The bulk of the work involved in producing Same Sins Separate Paths, has already been completed. The story has been written, formatting and cover design has been completed, and a publisher has been identified. I am choosing to work with Ingram Spark, an established, well-known, and reputable print-on-demand-publisher with extensive industry experience and ties.</p>
<p>The next hurdle is in marketing and promotion. While future plans are to launch the novel in as many locations as possible, the two (2) primary settings, Beaufort SC and Baltimore MD have been targeted for initial launch. Devoting an equal amount of time in both venues may present a scheduling challenge but not one that is insurmountable when approached with great coordination, key contacts, and established resources on the ground.</p>
<h2>USE OF FUNDS</h2>
<p>If we are successful in reaching our targeted funding goal, the funds will be used for the following critical components necessary for making Same Sins Separate Paths a total success:</p>
<p>-Email pitch and press release creation<br/>-Press release distribution<br/>-TV and radio appearances<br/>-Digital Marketing<br/>-Scouting, filtering and selection of local bookstores, festivals and events for book signing/book talk<br/>-Schedule guaranteed book signings depending on author availability and store schedule<br/>-Callbacks and follow-ups using phone and emails<br/>-Creation and maintenance of Facebook fan page, Twitter, LinkedIn and Pinterest accounts<br/>-Locating targeted book reviewers</p>

<h3>What is this?</h3>
<p><i>Fterota Logia </i>is an online literary journal focused on <strong>young adult literature</strong>. About a year ago, the website launched in response to a lack of YA literary journals. Throughout the last year, our journal has had the opportunity to publish, and get to know, so many amazing authors in the young adult literature world. Halfway through the year, the journal expanded to include <strong>book reviews</strong> and <strong>author interviews</strong>. </p>
<p>Take a minute and explore <a href=""http://fterotalogia.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>our website</strong></a> -- we promise, you won't be disappointed! </p>
<h3>Why Should You Contribute?</h3>
<p>Alright, so here’s what you’re looking at. If we reach our goal, <i>Fterota Logia</i> will be able to print <strong>one whole issue</strong> commemorating our first year in existence. We’re talking a beautiful journal <strong>with over a hundred pages of fiction, essays, interviews, reviews, and artwork, </strong>featuring our wildly exciting and varied list of contributors.</p>
<p>BUT WAIT, THERE’S MORE.</p>
<p>Your contribution will also help us begin <strong>paying our contributors</strong>. This is something that we’ve unfortunately been unable to do in our first year, but something that we hope to remedy ASAP.<br/> </p>
<h3>
<i>Fterota Logia</i>'s Mission Statement</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Fterota Logia, or 'winged words', is a translation of the classical Greek expression 'epea pteroenta' used most famously by Homer. For Homer, the expression was used to either signify the importance of the words (the passion), to signify spontaneity in language or to connote 'unusual truths'. This feels very in tune with how young adult literature works for its intended audience. Additionally, it reminds us of the connection between YA literature and folklore/myths.</p>
<p>Fterota Logia aims to encapsulate the essence of young adult literature, while also providing a space for open discussion and theorizing of the genre.</p>
<p>Our mission is to create a forum where new works of young adult fiction will be celebrated.</p>
<p>Our mission is to cultivate intellectual discussion and a deeper understanding of the importance of young adult literature.</p>
<p>We are dedicated to working with authors to help them reach their full potential. We want every author, every child who puts pen to paper or adult who wants to indulge their creativity, to learn and grow.</p>
<p>We will scout out new authors and voices, those who love YA and those who hate it, those who are young – in body or in spirit – and those who have an intimate connection and understanding of young adult literature. We aim to fill our journal with insightful interviews, feature columns, and more.</p>

According, to Jane Ellen Stevens' Ace Study May 13, 2013, “Nearly 35 million U.S children have experienced one or more types of childhood trauma and the numbers are growing.” Unfortunately, childhood abuse is a topic most find hard to discuss.

<h3>C. L. Murray's Story</h3>
<p>I started coughing up blood every day last October. It began as just an annoying dry cough right after I’d slightly choked on a wasabi-slathered dumpling. I was sure my little culinary mishap had caused some kind of inflammation that led to bronchitis, and, having no insurance, I tried to just tough it out even as regular fevers accompanied the problem. The knifing pains that grew worse in my lower abdomen and back were just a result of the strain the cough was putting on my muscles, I kept telling myself.</p>
<p>Finally, after three weeks of wishing this would clear up on its own, I went to Urgent Care on Nov 1 and was swiftly diagnosed with testicular cancer that had spread to my liver and lungs. The doctor was quick to reassure me that this type of cancer is very treatable with an extremely high survival rate, and I drove home accepting the completed puzzle whose little pieces I’d been ignoring since long before that cough had set in.</p>
<p>I spent the next few days discovering my luck was so much better than I’d realized, getting insurance through Covered California and persuading the fine people who work for San Diego County to expedite my coverage so I wouldn’t have to wait till the New Year to start treatment. Turns out their timing was excellent as my left leg started feeling like it had a 30-pound weight strapped to it when I walked, then quickly became sore, swollen, purplish, and barely able to get me around the house.</p>
<p>One week after my diagnosis, I was finally able to see the oncologist I’d been referred to, who sent me for an ultrasound that revealed the cancer had caused a major blood clot extending through my leg into my abdomen. While seeing few alternatives to weeks of waiting for various scans before treatment could begin, I was again super fortunate to be seen by a urologist who took all of two minutes to assess my situation and have me admitted to the hospital.</p>
<p>During a week when I would have otherwise been twiddling my thumbs waiting for one minor step toward treatment, the hospital staff wasted no time knocking out every barrier between me and the lifesaving care I needed. An MRI showed that my brain was clear of tumors, and other procedures found that the blood clot had traveled through my heart and set up shop in my lungs with the cancer.</p>
<p>After five cycles of chemo, and five months of giving myself two shots in the stomach per day to keep my blood from turning to cottage cheese, my cancer and blood clots are on the run, but there's still a long road ahead. Chemo and related complications have gotten tougher, and I'm looking at seven weeks in the hospital for more intense treatment with a few breaks in between. The bad days are largely outnumbered by the good, though, and there won't be a trace left of this disease after a few more months.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I'll be spending seven weeks in the hospital over the next few months getting high-dose chemo and other therapies, but I'll still be able to conduct my book marketing and deliver your e-books with just a few keystrokes on my laptop. I should be out of the hospital when it's time to sign and mail your paperbacks, which will provide me some much-needed fresh air and exercise.</p>

<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>My name is Daniel Ayerzon.  I spent the last year following Andrew Yang around the country and was able to witness a phenomenon that is very much unprecedented.  He changed the country for the better.  He did this in the most specific way by activating a mass amount of people that were waiting for a leader of his caliber to energize us all to get up and do something to create the kind of America we can be proud of.  This is my journey and what the campaign meant to me and so many others.   Contributions are not needed to be made just click on perk to preorder the book only.   If you want to contribute more it is appreciated. </p>
<p>This project is important because many more people that were not paying attention need to be reached out to and find out about what happened to start the spark that will change our country. As I gain more funding I will be able to promote the book at a greater level and will be able to provide more content that has not been released to the public, as of yet.  Also, there is a movie based on the book that is in the works and this initial campaign is the start of this incredible movement to get the word out.  It all starts here so give much and give more so we can again create an America we can be proud of. </p>
<p>I am raising ten thousand dollars for the initial campaign.  This is for the pre-sale of the book that you will receive via email digital download.  You will also receive a discount code for a signed copy of the physical book that will be out shortly after the initial digital delivery.  You will also receive full access to the Yang Gang website that will be launched on the day of the digital-book release.  That website will have extra video clips and content for those that pre-purchased the book.  You will also be listed on the website as a contributor.  If the goal is not met then you will not receive anything but a refund.  You will also have to wait an extended amount of time to receive the book.  You will be able to order instead off my Website with a donation. </p>
<p>I do not have the resources to get the book published without your help.  If it is truly to be done then I need the Yang Gang to come together and help.   Let's get more information out there about our movement and the good word of Yang. </p>
<p>I have been traveling around the United States and like many of you, I expected Andrew to get elected as our new president.  Because that didn't happen we need to prepare for our next opportunity.  Having a book is a step in that direction.  If you can't buy an advanced copy, you can share this campaign with others and use the Indiegogo share tool.   Let's get this done with the hashtag #YangLeaders and #YangwasRight</p>

<h3>Hi, I'm Eleanor, I am mum to three children; Maya, Oscar &amp; Ava.</h3>
<p>I used to be a secondary school teacher until recently, when I realised I could make more of an impact on children's futures away from the classroom. I am massively passionate about wanting to help children reach their true potential in life. My vision is to empower children to enable them to be successful in life.</p>
<p>Last year I launched my first two children's books, named after my two oldest children, to help encourage children everywhere to believe in themselves and dream big. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552083527/sqdoj4xcrcysztmlqget.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>This campaign will help to launch my third, and arguably most important, book so far. Ava was born in May 2018, we had a post natal diagnosis of Down's Syndrome quickly followed by finding out she had a hole in her heart. Ava is an absolute blessing to our family and everyone she meets. We all feel so incredibly lucky to have her in our lives. Since her birth and open heart surgery we regularly find ways to support the charities and community groups that have helped us and will continue to do so throughout Ava's life. Once I make a profit with any of my books some of the money will be donated to these fantastic causes.</p>

<p>I started to look for books to help my own children, and others who may meet Ava, to understand that differences in people are good and help them to understand that sometimes people might need a little more help to be able to join in. It appeared such books were few and far between. That became my inspiration and motivation for Ava The Mermaid.</p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign you will be helping to spread the message of acceptance, inclusion and understanding to children everywhere.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funding I am asking for will be enough to have the book illustrated by an amazing local artist and get 300 copies printed ready to distribute.</p>
<p>Once the books physically exist I will be using them to work with children in schools, community groups, libraries, hospitals, etc.</p>
<p>Even if I do not reach the full amount requested it will be a start in the process.</p>
<p>As a contributor, you could be one of the first people to receive a signed copy of Ava The Mermaid to share with any little (or big!) people who are important to you. </p>
<p>An acknowledgement to all contributors will be made in the book.</p>
<p>There are other perks available depending on what you are able to contribute.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey everyone!!</p>
<p>My name is Tyia Lashe! I am a self-published children’s author from Kansas City, MO. My books are catered to little black girls! To me, it’s important for little black girls to see themselves in a positive light at all times. It’s important that little black girls see themselves being creative, loving themselves, being bold, embracing their gifts, being kind to others...and every other positive way!</p>
<p> I am on a mission to self-publish 3 books in 3 months! Why 3 books in 3 months? Let me tell you! Urgency! I have self-published 5 children’s books over the course of 3 years! That’s a long time! I have so many poems &amp; stories that are already written just waiting to get published! There is  a little girl who needs my books today at this point in their life! Not next year!</p>
<p>Well you’ve self-published before Tyia, why do you need my contribution this time? I’m glad you asked! Self-publishing can get expensive, especially when it comes to paying an illustrator out of my own pocket! Many self-published authors utilize sites to connect with artists around the world to create illustrations for the low! However, I  have realized that there are talented black female artists in Kansas City who can do the same job, if not better!! I want to support the artists in my city and pay them decently!</p>
<p>Your contribution will also help with maintaining my self-publishing software during the 3 months and ordering inventory once the books are completed!</p>
<p>Y’all...</p>
<p>I write to empower little black girls. I write to uplift little black girls. I write to inspire little black girls because I was once a little black girl who didn’t know her worth. </p>

<h3> </h3>
<p><i>I Hope This Makes You Feel Less Alone</i> is a book of poetry that welcomes you into my personal experiences, my losses and victories, my pains and joys, and many of the things which I’ve learned along the way. It represents the ways in which I’ve been impacted by others and the way in which our stories are woven together beautifully, though we may not notice it in the moment. It is a book about grief and loss yet finding hope in the midst of it.</p>
<p>My name is Jordin West and I penned <i>I Hope This Makes You Feel Less Alone.</i> I hope these pages leave you with a resounding echo of hope, strength, and communion. For there is brilliance and beauty in our journeys, especially when they get to encounter one another. I hope that from reading this book, that you’ll realize the impact that art can have in one’s life and that you can acquire a sense of gratitude for all that is around you. Most importantly, I wrote this book in hopes that every single reader is able to recognize two things: first, that you are less alone than you think. And secondly, that you are more loved than you think.</p>
<h3>The Book:</h3>
<p>The book begins with my acknowledgments of people who have helped me get to where I am. Then, there is a poem that opens up the idea of who I hope this book is able to reach and encourage (disclaimer: it’s everyone), regardless of current or past situations, pains, or regrets.</p>
<p>After the initial opening, the book is separated into two parts.</p>
<p>The first part is titled Sorrow and Pain. It walks through circumstances in my life that have left me feeling like I was sucker-punched, fighting and gasping for breath. It is a collection of some of my greatest pains and holds the depths of many of my sorrows. It is honest, raw, and unfiltered.</p>
<p>The second part is titled Hope Beyond What’s Seen. It is an assortment of lessons I’ve come to realize through my losses and phrases that have gotten me through to the other side. And I hope they can do the same for you: remind you of greater things ahead, pain left behind, and hope on the horizon.</p>
<h3> </h3>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Receive:</h3>
<p>I am publishing this book through Author Solutions. I have set-up tiers to help cover the cost that is in place to publish my work. The money raised in support will go towards editing, design and layout, launching and promoting, as well the production. </p>
<p>There are perks included such as copies of the book, hand-written cards, personalized poems, and thank you videos! I'm excited to thank you guys individually.</p>
<p>If I don't reach the entire goal, I plan on keeping what was raised and finding another source to finish the publication of my book.</p>
<h3>About the Author:</h3>
<p>I am a current, soon to be graduated, senior at Geneva College. I will be receiving my bachelor’s in student ministries. I have never taken a writing class, except for one in high school. Writing wasn’t something that came naturally to me, but rather something that I picked up on my journey of attempting to process through difficult situations and emotions.</p>
<p>For an example of my writing, you can check out this spoken word I got the opportunity to write and be featured on a friend’s release! (<a href=""https://youtu.be/bnWHFAak8_k"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://youtu.be/bnWHFAak8_k</a>)</p>
<p>Apart from writing and leading at church, I love to simply be in nature and experience the goodness of the created world. Creation encourages, inspires, and humbles me every single time I explore it.</p>
<p>I’m a firm believer that every encounter we have with one another, whether in passing, or through reading, or person, every encounter is priceless and holds potential. I believe that we are far more capable of great, brilliant, and stunning things together than we ever would be capable of on our own. The other has the ability to better us and help us become who we are intended to be. And that’s why I wrote this. Hoping that my words can remind you of your beautiful potential and help you fight another day, because you’re worth it.</p>
<p>I have walked through many losses, as well as anxiety at times and depression more so. I have felt more alone than I’d care to admit. And I would never want anyone else to feel alone in their pain, because there’s nothing worse. And so, if nothing else, I hope I am able to remind you of the beauty that is in the potential of tomorrow and of the hope that can be found in today. You are not alone, and never will you be.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges:</h3>
<p>As with anything, challenges arise. The main challenge with publishing a book is being able to distribute the finished product to each supporter. Because of that, I have taken the precaution of ensuring that this will not be an issue by incorporating the costs of shipping and mailing of the copies within each tier.</p>

<h3>My Memoir</h3>
<p>This book is my memoir—a memoir that for several years now, I have known I would one day write. But let’s set the record straight right here. Part, but only part, of the impetus for writing my memoir at this time, is the publishing of our daughter’s book, Educated.</p>
<p>I want to tell the story of my life as I really lived it.  I want my grandchildren to know who their grandmother is and was, and I want to be a force for good in their lives. Also, I feel a compelling desire to shine a light of accuracy on homeschooling, herbal medicine, and the living of a conservative and Christian way of life.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Self Publishing</h3>
<p>There are significant differences between self-publishing a book and submitting a manuscript to a publisher. One important difference is that when an author signs with a publisher, the author may be relinquishing at least some control over the content of their book. Final editorial decisions often rest with the publisher, even if those decisions are contrary to the author’s wishes. The motivations of the author and publisher may not always be aligned.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>My Dream</h3>
<p>The educational changes being implemented as a result of Covid-19 are changing perspectives about education. Parents everywhere are now carrying more of the responsibility of educating their children, and they are discovering how challenging— and how rewarding—it is to interact with your children in this way day in and day out. I see parents having the same desires for their children’s educations that we had in our day.</p>
<p>I also see a great deal of frustration as families try to ascertain what will work best for them. I tell these harried parents that filling in for the teacher temporarily is not the same as settling into homeschooling as a way of life and that it will get easier as they proceed. I feel a great deal of admiration for them as they take it on, adjusting and making the best of challenging situations.</p>
<p>I hope that this book in some small way will be encouraging to those struggling to pioneer a new way of educating their children.</p>
<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>LaRee Westover was born in southeastern Idaho and attended public schools and Brigham Young University. She was blessed with an inquisitive mind, and stories about her early childhood often end with her having said, “I can do it myself!” She and her husband, Val, are the parents of two girls and five boys, all of whom were homeschooled. Six went on to receive more formal education, and three earned PhD degrees. Her family, which now includes 36 grandchildren, is the joy of her life LaRee prepared extensively and worked as a midwife for several years. She has published four books on homeopathic remedies, herbal remedies, and essential oils for the multimillion-dollar business, Butterfly Express.

<p>For the last year or so, I have been creating a little journal of stories and poetry using the power of crowdfunding, through Patreon. Latchkey Tales started out as an experiment in subscription-based crowd-funding, but has turned into something a lot more: it is now a labour of love for me - kind of my urchin child.

<p>In the time since then, Solarwyrm has produced a number of books, and we've had the opportunity to work with a wealth of incredibly talented people, and to connect with readers and fans all over the world.

<p>Latchkey Tales is, in many ways, the epitome of this. Many of the people who have created stories, poems and art for Latchkey have become more than just work colleagues - they've become community, friends. There is no way Latchkey could exist without the willingness of the artists and writers to put their hearts into it with me. And there is no way it could exist without the subscribers who buy and read these stories month after month. It can't exist without you.

internet is all about websites, and websites are about valuable contents for
visitors. And websites contents are mainly articles. You’ll visit a website
because you want certain information; and over 90 percent of information on
websites is usually in form of articles.</p>
<p>So, it means that for website owners to draw and satisfy their visitors,
they need to have valuable articles on their websites, lots of websites owners
can’t write article themselves because their busy schedules. And this where the
opportunity has opened up for article writers who could write articles and make
great income right from their homes, at their set time. The book $700 - $5,000
For 1,000 Words contains an immediate access to the job, specifically for U.S

My
names are Cornelius David, an African-American. An Amazon author with many

·The
internet is all about websites, and websites are about valuable contents for
visitors. And websites contents are mainly articles. You’ll visit a website
because you want certain information; and over 90 percent of information on
websites is usually in form of articles.
So, it means that for website owners to draw and satisfy their visitors,
they need to have valuable articles on their websites, lots of websites owners
can’t write article themselves because their busy schedules. And this where the
opportunity has opened up for article writers who could write articles and make
great income right from their homes, at their set time. The book $700 - $5,000

favorite city visit
2.  Party location in your city.

<h3>Who Are You Exactly?</h3>
<p>We're UNTUCKED, your friendly neighborhood arts magazine. We gather local writers, musicians, and artists and get them together so young, passionate, creative minds like yourself can enjoy the fruits of their labors. Most importantly, we put an honest to goodness real live magazine in your hands, because we understand how important it is, in this ephemeral age of information, to hold a solid page in your hands and drag your eyes across some good art. The printed issue is the center of everything we do at UNTUCKED, and it’s where you and your donation come in.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>So What's My Money Get Me?</h3>
<p>Let’s face it: books don't grow on trees. Well, technically they start as trees, but we don't have time to get into that here. Eventually, once the trees have reached the point of being paper, the paper needs to be printed, bound, finished, and delivered. And that costs money. Though a portion of your donation does go to various other things like overhead, funding this campaign, donor perks, etc, the bulk of the money goes directly to the production of the physical magazine.</p>
<p>We've priced out the minimum amount of money we need to publish Volume I, Issue II. In the graph below you can see exactly how much money will go where if we meet our $7,500 goal.</p>

We promise to never use the money for anything other than progressing the magazine. Your money will not get the Editors a trip to Hawaii, nor will it pay for a brand new car. Every penny raised from this campaign will support our dream of producing a magazine that we (and you) can be proud of.</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>So Why Should I Trust You?</h3>
<p>We've got experience. This is the second issue of UNTUCKED and we've worked out the kinks, kicked the tires, and taken it around the block. The Staff of UNTUCKED have combined years of experience in the production and distribution of periodicals, from the high school to the university levels and beyond, and we have connections to outlets capable of getting UNTUCKED into the hands and minds of the community. So, as much as its always a bad sign when a fictional character says it: trust us, we've done this before.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Ok, But What Are The Risks? Didn't I Read That Print Was Dead? Can I Be Charged With Grave Robbing? </h3>
<p>Print is a proven technology. We're not designing, prototyping or doing anything with hypotheticals. It’s simple, we've got the writing, we've got the art, we've got the design. All we need is you, and your donation, and we can push the button that gets the magazine rolling off the presses. Really, the only risk in this day and age is that no one reads it. And you wouldn't not read a magazine you funded, would you?</p>
<p>So join us. Help us give a platform to the voices of young writers and artists who have important things to say about their experiences and our world. Help us do something that brings communities together. Help us do something we can all be proud of.  Help us do something that you can honestly say is good. Join us. Let your hair down, loosen that tie, stop censoring yourself. Be unscripted, unbuttoned, UNTUCKED.</p>

<p><span>Publishing Winter in Paris will help me tell stories that resonate with single women and men around the world, inspiring them to act. Who does not want to find love? How far would you go?

<p><span>I have never self-published, and so I may be oblivious to certain details. But I have taken workshops and read about successful paths to self-publication. </span></p>
<p>Like anyone, I have self-doubt at times. English is not my first language. Vocabulary may be a roadblock at certain moments, to convey exactly what I mean. But when I think about the voices of millions who call North America home, I feel confident that we need to be heard and our stories told and published.</p>Most importantly, I am a communicator and an aspiring writer. Good storytelling comes from the heart and the spirit. I will find support in a good editor. <p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p></p>

My name is Lupita Peimbert. As professional journalist, I have been telling stories on traditional media for as long as I can remember. I currently blog, post, tweet, and pin often - with the intention to somehow inspire others to do what they have always wanted.  I aspire to become a published author.

A few years ago, I crossed the ocean from North America to France, in an imperfectly planned relocation, alone. I trusted that if I stayed forever or even just for a few months, it would be transformational, and Paris was worth the risk. Divorced, single, and more or less stuck in matters of the heart, I was hoping to find love once and for all.

I’ll meet and talk about writing or publishing your own book ($200)  
You’ll be in the guest list for an unforgettable cocktail party in Paris, shall I ever become wealthy enough to host it. I mean it. ($500 or more) 



If we surpass our goal, I could apply to distributing the book or go on a book tour, or make postcards out of some of the amazing pictures I took, and pursue publishing houses. Shoot, I could even translate the book to other languages. (I’d better stop here!) 
If we don't reach our goal, I would apply the collected funds to self publishing as possible, with priority given to editor, graphic designer, and whatever other publishing needs are pressing from there.    The Impact
Publishing Winter in Paris will help me tell stories that resonate with single women and men around the world, inspiring them to act. Who does not want to find love? How far would you go? How important is it to take a leap of faith, and trust the outcome? How about moving to the city of your dreams? What if you move and end up not finding love? What happens when you go home? My stories are your stories, too, or they could be.   Risks & Challenges 
I have never self-published, and so I may be oblivious to certain details. But I have taken workshops and read about successful paths to self-publication. 
Like anyone, I have self-doubt at times. English is not my first language. Vocabulary may be a roadblock at certain moments, to convey exactly what I mean. But when I think about the voices of millions who call North America home, I feel confident that we need to be heard and our stories told and published.Most importantly, I am a communicator and an aspiring writer. Good storytelling comes from the heart and the spirit. I will find support in a good editor.    Other Ways You Can Help

<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p>Sometimes we find ourselves sliding down a slippery slope. Everything is fine until one day, we find ourselves at the bottom of the slope and we can't climb back up. We can't climb back up because it's too slippery and we are tired and have no energy or motivation to do so. </p>
<p><b>We need to find a way to learn ""The Art of Uphill Skiing""</b></p>
<p>The Art of Uphill Skiing will be an easy to read workbook, written as a result of my own personal journey back up that slippery slope. It will explain the 15 steps I use every day (see below)  when I need to feel <b>happier</b>, <b>healthier </b>and more in <b>control</b></p>
<p>If you too are feeling a little lost, frustrated or unsatisfied with your life. If you, or anyone you know, are looking for a light-hearted, easy to follow solution that will help you find a way to be happier, healthier and more in control of your life every day. This book is the perfect place for you to start.</p>
<p>I'm looking for people to support me getting this project completed by pre-purchasing my book, to help me fund the publishing process and of course to let me know that you believe it is a worthy cause!</p>
<p>If you want to know more about me, my story and why I am writing this book, then read on....</p>
<h2><b>My Story</b></h2> <p></p>
<p>I have been thinking about writing this book for over a year now, but in reality it's been a project that's been in the making for about 10 years and it's finally time to make it real, so that I can help others who are struggling just like I was.</p>
<p>It was January 2012 and I was curled up on my living room floor, crying uncontrollably. I was squinting at my mobile phone through floods of tears and trying to figure out how to could call for an ambulance. I could barely breathe, let alone talk to anyone and who could I call anyway?</p>
<p>I had run out of money, I felt like I had no friends and my life was in tatters.</p>
<p>I didn't know it at the time, but I was suffering from an anxiety attack. After struggling with depression for several years before, my body had finally had enough and it had decided that it needed me to deal with my situation.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I did find a friend to text and even though he was in Birmingham at the time, Mark helped me get my breathing under control and I managed to get an appointment to see a doctor.</p>
<p>My doctor prescribed anti-depressants. Having been on the pills before, I did not want to be stuck on them again and I wondered if maybe there was a better way to deal with the depression. My doctor got me to start claiming benefits to sort out my immediate money worries and suggested exercise, mindfulness and counselling. Some of this worked, but not consistently. So I started working on finding other ways to understand and overcome the depression and anxiety and finding ways to make it easier and longer lasting.</p>
<p>What I found was a set of tools that can be used by anyone to make them feel happier every day and to stay that way more often. These things can help us all and if you are a happy person most of the time, you will find that you are already doing many of them anyway, I know that I certainly was before I started to run into difficulties.</p>
<p><b><i>The Art of Uphill Skiing</i></b> is the result of my personal journey and the solutions I found along the way. It will lay out the 15 steps I now use (almost) every day to help me feel happier and to live my life on my terms rather than just letting life happen to me. It's based on a lot of personal development books, audios and courses that I used (and continue to use) to help me recover and stay out of that deep hole of depression!</p>
<h2><b>The 15 steps</b></h2>
<p>The book will summarise everything I have learned, and signpost you to other books for further reading. It will be an easy to read, practical book, with exercises and tasks included to help you get into new, more beneficial habits. I will break down why each of these things is beneficial, how to do them and how to stick at them, and why sometimes we don't stick to our beneficial habits!</p>

working with horror writers. <br/>
<br/>
That's why I'm hosting this second writers retreat at the historic and
haunted birthplace of Stephen King's <i>The Shining</i>, <b>The Stanley Hotel</b>
in Estes Park, Colorado. <br/>
<br/>
If you want to join us, simply register by choosing a package here on this campaign and I'll send you the code to receive
the group discount rate when you make your hotel reservations. <br/>
<br/>
*Editing Packages and Event Registration does not include your hotel room or
transportation fees. Hotel room rates are listed at the bottom of the page.* <br/>
<br/>
But your registration <i>does </i>include all our group discount perks, select
editing packages, inclusion on any outings/trips over the weekend, and a
guaranteed tour of Room 217. <br/>
<br/>
Join us on our Facebook group page and help us plan the trip together for 2015: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/stanleyretreat"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/stanleyretreat</a><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/stanleyretreat"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><br/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1119694/files/20141227232030-1.jpg?1419751230"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><br/><br/>We don't want to set a rigid
schedule or any programming that would take away from your writing time, since
this is a retreat and not a convention or conference. So no dealers room, and
very limited programming. Instead we're offering a unique experience with a great
group of authors and publishing professionals, in a fantastic hotel with a
history steeped in horror (fiction?) <br/>
<br/>
Each package includes different perks that should fit the need of all authors,
whether you're looking for some feedback and a polishing of your work...or
you're just needing a great place to write and get away. Let us host your
once-in-a-lifetime writing escape, and we'll promise you a great time in a
scenic and spooky locale. <br/>
<br/>
For the last few years I've served as the pitch session coordinator for three horror writers conventions, two of which I was also a co-chair. So I've had
some solid experience seeing how hosting events operates from the inside. And
with the first Stanley Hotel Writers Retreat being a successful event, we've decided to return in 2015 for a weekend we'll all
remember for years to come. I hope you find this idea as exciting as I do, and
I truly hope you'll join us for this unique and haunting writing experience! The Stanley Hotel is truly amazing...<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1119696/files/20141227232650-2.jpg?1419751610"" src="""" style=""""/><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1119698/files/20141227232720-3.jpg?1419751640"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1119702/files/20141227232759-4.jpg?1419751679"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1119705/files/20141227232837-5.jpg?1419751717"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Advance tickets will be available through the hotel

Cavender and I love
working with horror writers. 

That's why I'm hosting this second writers retreat at the historic and
haunted birthplace of Stephen King's The Shining, The Stanley Hotel
in Estes Park, Colorado. 

If you want to join us, simply register by choosing a package here on this campaign and I'll send you the code to receive
the group discount rate when you make your hotel reservations. 

*Editing Packages and Event Registration does not include your hotel room or
transportation fees. Hotel room rates are listed at the bottom of the page.* 

But your registration does include all our group discount perks, select
editing packages, inclusion on any outings/trips over the weekend, and a
guaranteed tour of Room 217. 

Join us on our Facebook group page and help us plan the trip together for 2015: https://www.facebook.com/stanleyretreatWe don't want to set a rigid
schedule or any programming that would take away from your writing time, since
this is a retreat and not a convention or conference. So no dealers room, and
very limited programming. Instead we're offering a unique experience with a great
group of authors and publishing professionals, in a fantastic hotel with a
history steeped in horror (fiction?) 

Each package includes different perks that should fit the need of all authors,
whether you're looking for some feedback and a polishing of your work...or
you're just needing a great place to write and get away. Let us host your
once-in-a-lifetime writing escape, and we'll promise you a great time in a
scenic and spooky locale. 

For the last few years I've served as the pitch session coordinator for three horror writers conventions, two of which I was also a co-chair. So I've had
some solid experience seeing how hosting events operates from the inside. And
with the first Stanley Hotel Writers Retreat being a successful event, we've decided to return in 2015 for a weekend we'll all
remember for years to come. I hope you find this idea as exciting as I do, and
I truly hope you'll join us for this unique and haunting writing experience! The Stanley Hotel is truly amazing...Advance tickets will be available through the hotel
for the Friday night Murder Mystery Dinner at The Stanley Hotel and the annual
Shining Masquerade Ball on Saturday night, as well! Group rates are also
available for ghost tours of the hotel and paranormal investigations.
Event registrations/packages for The Stanley Hotel Writers Retreat are transferable, but non-refundable.
If you're not entirely sure if you can make it, please don't register.
Funds for this event will be spent as they come in, securing rooms, vehicles,
and other event expenses. Cancellations will create problems, so commit to this
now...don't flake out...and we'll see you then! 

Fees for cancellation with the hotel and every last detail to reserve rooms are
listed below. Confirmation of perk/package redemption will be within 24-hours,
with instructions on how to redeem your room discounts at The Stanley Hotel
once you've registered. 

We hope to see you in October!+Guest of Honor Authors+ appearing @ Stanley Hotel Writers Retreat 2015:JACK KETCHUMhttp://www.jackketchum.net/JOSH MALERMANhttp://www.harpercollins.com/cr-107479/josh-mal...RICHARD CHIZMARhttps://www.facebook.com/richardchizmarTRENT ZELAZNYhttps://www.facebook.com/trentzelaznyKEALAN PATRICK BURKE(Due to impending deadlines, Kealan Patrick Burke has had to cancel.)DANIEL KNAUFhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm0460567/And don't forget about out pre-event party in Denver!

<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The
Drunken Odyssey offers a great value to the literary community. Its interviews
are remarkable. The breadth of its scope is impressive; where else can you
listen to novelists, short story writers, poets, journalists, screenwriters,
scholars, and artists discuss their process and life’s work? Plus, it’s like an
uncensored NPR, so the host and guests can curse when necessary, or admit when
the world happens to be fucking far from a civilized place.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The
main risk of my podcast, as I see it, is stagnation. I don’t want the show to
seem like an exercise asking the same questions and fielding a predictable
range of answers. I happen to be fiercely curious, hence my unwillingness to
limit the show to a genre. I have genuinely enjoyed every interview, whether
the writer is experiencing her first book publication, or the author was an
inaugural poet, like Richard Blanco. But I do want to keep exploring with this
show, and to keep expanding the media it produces. In 2014, TDO released its
first documentary, on the mermaids of <a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Weeki
Wachee Springs</a>. There are many plans in the works for the future of TDO,
both for the audio podcast and its youtube content.

</p>
<p>The
challenge is expanding without losing the high quality you’ve come to expect on
the show. Generally speaking, TDO sounds great. The interviews sound sharp, and
are memorable. If the economics of running the show were taken care of for the
next year, which $1,500 would take care of, then I should be able to focus on
these new adventures.</p>

The Drunken Odyssey with John King is a weekly podcast
about the writing life. Since June of 2012,  I’ve released a new episode ranging from about an hour to 2
hours, with the occasional epic-length podcast. All 164+ episodes are free to
download. I’ve interviewed many famous writers on this show, including David Sedaris, Cheryl Strayed, Chuck Klosterman, John Waters, Nikki Giovanni, Rick Moody, Tony Hoagland, Greg Proops, Sharon Olds, Irvine Welsh, Martin Amis,
Walter Mosley, and many, many others. Besides interviewing writers, I bring in
other writers for roundtable discussions related to literature, as well as
respond to listener mail with David James Poissant and review books about the craft of writing with Vanessa Blakeslee. 

The experience of putting on and releasing this show has
been an extraordinary pleasure for me, but I do need some help making the show
sustainable in the future. There are regular expenses of producing the show,
travel expenses, and upgrades that would really help The Drunken Odyssey be able to keep releasing great content. I am asking
m y listeners, new and old, to donate to the show towards these goals.


 
 
 
What We Need & What You Get


This
year, I’m trying to raise $1,500. Any progress toward this ultimate goal will
help us to achieve a number of incremental goals:





Administrative
     costs: hosting on Wordpress and
     file hosting on Libsyn.



Equipment upgrades: TDO really needs more microphones, digital
     recorders, and a good camera to build up our youtube content.



Travel: Miami Book Fair International is a
     significant cost, despite how frugal your podcast host tends to be.


Any cash left over will be
     saved towards future administrative costs. 


The perks are fab! 



If I reach my goal of
     $1,500, I'll record a bonus episode for donors.

It originally began as a little poem to help comfort the child, but I eventually decided to make it something bigger to try and help other kids get through their nightmares. It's also a kind of tool for parents to help diffuse the fear that their kids experience when faced with unpleasant sleeps.""     -Crash LaResh

        

                                                    
The book is about  a little boy named Vex who has violent night terrors riddled with ""Spookies"". The night terrors are so bad that the Spookies invade his waking world. On top of being taunted by the foul creatures, everyone refuses to believe Vex- even his Mum and little sister Twink think he's crazy...poor kid. 


Enter Bob Macabre- infamous Spookie Wrangler and head of the Nightmare World. Bob teaches Vex how to conquer his fears and defeat the Spookies through a series of adventures.

                         
Tricia Martin- ""I'm illustrating the world Crash has formed in his head based on Jax's descriptions of his night terrors...at least I try to ;) Each drawing has to receive the stamp of approval from Jax before they're made a permanent part of the book. I cower in fear each time I submit a drawing (kidding- we all actually get along quite well.)  
We've been working on the book together since 2007, and we wanna' finally be able to share it with the world and maybe help some kids...and their parental units, sleep a little better. ""
        
                                           What We Need & Your Prizes For Helping Us 
We need to raise at least $8,000 to help us out with the artwork, IndieGoGo and Paypal fees, editing, layout and design of the book, creation of an e-book version, printing of hard copies, and the creation of the awesome perks we have for you over there on the right side of your screen. 
Perks include spooktacular t-shirts, signed posters, handwritten postcards, signed prints (You can see the poster/print designs that fans voted for in our Gallery), signed copies of the book, personalized greetings written for you or your kid by Crash LaResh himself, custom doodles by me- Tricia, and many, many more! Even our $5 donors get a prize! Yay! The perks won't bite, so scroll through and have a look. No worries, it's safe...very, very safe. 

                 

If we don't make our goal, that's also safe- all donors will still receive their perks and our gratitudes...TENS of gratitudes! Of course the book perks would take much longer to get to donors because we'd have to find an alternate way of funding the production of them, but yes- we guarantee to honor all perks in as timely of a manner as possible.
If we exceed our goal by $1,000, there will be an initial stretch goal to create a Midnight, Me & Bob Macabre coloring book! Yay!  And YOU will be a part of deciding what that looks like! We'll be giving everyone a chance to vote on which of Tricia's drawRings are included in the coloring book- neat!
FUTURE STRETCH GOALS! If there is enough interest, we'd love to see this story animated! We've been in touch with Tony Todd (who played ""Candyman"") and have spoken with his agent about Mr. Todd doing the narration for a full-length animated version of the story. You can let us know if you'd like to see this happen by posting on FaceBook or Twitter using the hashtag #AnimateBobMacabre. We'll of course include new and more awesome perks :) More information to come if we reach our first two goals. Animation AND more perks! Yay moreperks! (yes all one word) 
    The Impact You Have 
ANY CONTRIBUTION has a HUGE impact on helping us bring this book to the world! I mean, yes we do need dollars to help make this book a reality, but sharing and spreading the word is just as important to us and just as much appreciated. You will be an integral part of making eight years of hard work and love for this book a reality and no words can express how awesome that is. 
We're working insanely hard to make this book as amazingly epic as possible for everyone. This is our first time doing anything like this, but every nano-second of work we put into it is more than worth the effort...a true labor of love. We sincerely hope you guys love it as much as we do.

Hi, I am Joji Yamaguchi, inventor of INUPATHY.
</p>

</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">
I am a software hardware engineer living in Japan.<br/>
I am a father of a dog (was two), and two human children.
</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;margin-bottom:30px;"">
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457398370/boyyqe71a2phewhdcgbo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">
I was a biology researcher before I started my career as an engineer.<br/>
My main interest was in animal behavior. When I was 27, I got married. My wife brought her dog, Midori, with her, and I became a father of a dog.
</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;margin-bottom:30px;"">
Soon after our marriage, we invited a second dog to our family.<br/>
His name is Akane, and he is the very reason why I invented INUPATHY.<br/>
When he was young, Akane seemed to be always afraid of something.
</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;margin-bottom:30px;"">
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457398861/s6javs6tz09tjcq4mvq8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">
I wanted to know him better. I wanted to know what made him stressed, <br/>and how I can make him more relaxed.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">
When I touch his chest, I could feel his little heart beating, sometimes fast, and some times slow. I wanted to be able to sense this any time. And so, I came up with the idea of visualizing dogs heart rate.
</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">
To do this, I had to invent a sensor that can sense heart beat over thick fur, gently, with no pain.
</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;margin-bottom:30px;"">
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457400513/dsfybm4sn4uj0iplt37b.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
</p>
<div>
<p style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;margin-bottom:30px;"">
I stepped in further to analyze heart rate. I modified HRV analysis,<br/> which analyzes the fluctuation of heart beat rhythm,<br/>so that it becomes suitable for dogs.<br/>After carefully observing dogs' behavior and the HRV pattern,<br/>I found patterns that appears typically when the dog is happy, and when the dog is concentrated.</p>

INUPATHY gave me many insight about Akane.<br/>
For example, when he is afraid,<br/>
 he can't be calm by talking to him gently. <br/>
I have to give him a gentle touch. <br/>

My belief is, that technology is not for human only.<br/>
Since our technology uses resource on earth,<br/>
we have to share it with other members on earth.<br/>

<p style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;margin-bottom:30px;"">
INUPATHY is also my first step to make a better<br/>
relationship with other species on Earth.<br/>

During our user test, we have tried INUPATHY on more than 40 dogs.<br/>
It seemed to be working well,<br/>
but we must admit that there can be exceptions.<br/>
We also still have a lot to do to optimize our design,<br/>
to make it as comfortable for dogs as possible.<br/>
Therefore, please note that there could be design changes.<br/>
</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;margin-bottom:30px;"">
We aim to be certified for FCC, CE, and TELEC.<br/>
When shipping to areas where our wireless module is not certified,<br/> 
we may have to disable the wireless connectivity of INUPATHY<br/> 
(Heart rate analysis and LED display will be supported,<br/>
but will not be able to connect to other devices, such as iOS devices).<br/>
</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;margin-bottom:30px;"">
When we fail to meet our $30,000 goal,<br/>
we will give up making steel mold,<br/>
but will produce and ship the product,<br/>
with 3D print. In this case, <br/>
the device will not be flexible, and will not be drip-proof.<br/>
</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;margin-bottom:30px;"">
Battery life is currently approximately 5 hours<br/>
(this depends on the average heart rate).<br/>
We will try our best to make it last longer.<br/>

How to use Indiegogo
















There is a lot to learn from your dog, but a dogs life is short.
INUPATHY is your chance to learn more from your dog, in depth.


How can we learn more from our dogs?The idea is to LOOK INSIDE DOGS BODY.
INUPATHY senses the small changes in your dogsheart rate, and visualize it in real time.






INUPATHY is the worlds first attempt to
visualize dogs mental condition, from heart rate analysis.




















The INUPATHY cloud service will take care of dogs heart rate data.
Long term analysis of the dogs condition will be done at the cloud service.






The INUPATHY system consits of three components.
Hardware, application, and cloud service.



As our future vision, we will implement device connectivity.
Via smartphones or other relay device,
INUPATHY will be able to send emotion
data to various devices. Imagine what will happen!


A toy reacting to your dogs' attention!
A camera that catches your dogs' happiest moment!
A food bowl that can tell you how much you dog likes his meal!






*Some of the App features shown above are stretch goals.




INUPATHY is designed like a harness.
Sensor will be attached to the chest belt.
The broad white area of the device is the LED display.






INUPATHY will be a perfect gift for your families dog, 
or your friends dog!





Hi, I am Joji Yamaguchi, inventor of INUPATHY.





I am a software hardware engineer living in Japan.
I am a father of a dog (was two), and two human children.





I was a biology researcher before I started my career as an engineer.
My main interest was in animal behavior. When I was 27, I got married. My wife brought her dog, Midori, with her, and I became a father of a dog.


Soon after our marriage, we invited a second dog to our family.
His name is Akane, and he is the very reason why I invented INUPATHY.
When he was young, Akane seemed to be always afraid of something.





I wanted to know him better. I wanted to know what made him stressed, and how I can make him more relaxed.

When I touch his chest, I could feel his little heart beating, sometimes fast, and some times slow. I wanted to be able to sense this any time. And so, I came up with the idea of visualizing dogs heart rate.


To do this, I had to invent a sensor that can sense heart beat over thick fur, gently, with no pain.






I stepped in further to analyze heart rate. I modified HRV analysis, which analyzes the fluctuation of heart beat rhythm,so that it becomes suitable for dogs.After carefully observing dogs' behavior and the HRV pattern,I found patterns that appears typically when the dog is happy, and when the dog is concentrated.





INUPATHY gave me many insight about Akane.
For example, when he is afraid,
 he can't be calm by talking to him gently. 
I have to give him a gentle touch. 





My belief is, that technology is not for human only.
Since our technology uses resource on earth,
we have to share it with other members on earth.


INUPATHY is also my first step to make a better
relationship with other species on Earth.
This is a dream far too big for one man. Please help me.
Become a part of the change we need to make.





During our user test, we have tried INUPATHY on more than 40 dogs.
It seemed to be working well,
but we must admit that there can be exceptions.
We also still have a lot to do to optimize our design,
to make it as comfortable for dogs as possible.
Therefore, please note that there could be design changes.


We aim to be certified for FCC, CE, and TELEC.
When shipping to areas where our wireless module is not certified, 
we may have to disable the wireless connectivity of INUPATHY 
(Heart rate analysis and LED display will be supported,
but will not be able to connect to other devices, such as iOS devices).


When we fail to meet our $30,000 goal,
we will give up making steel mold,
but will produce and ship the product,
with 3D print. In this case, 
the device will not be flexible, and will not be drip-proof.


Battery life is currently approximately 5 hours
(this depends on the average heart rate).
We will try our best to make it last longer.





When we meet our $30,000 the majority of the money 
will be spent on steel mold.
 Remaining will be used on safety tests and authentications
 (FCC, CE, TELEC).

<p>I'm a writer, accredited coach and London-based entrepreneur. I've written a non-fiction book called <i>What Went Wrong with Walter White?</i> based on the lead character of the classic TV drama, <i>Breaking Bad</i>. </p>
<p>Like many viewers, I was bowled over by the journey of Walter's character. For me, how it all started was as fascinating as how it went on to develop.  My work as a coach involves helping people deal with themes that the TV series explores. I decided to look at Walter's struggle as a lens for our own real-life challenges, hopes, dreams, and insecurities -- and what we can do about them. As I did this, I discovered a lot about Walter, but surprisingly even more about myself and the millions like me making sense of a fast-changing world.</p>
<p><i>What Went Wrong...</i> is about how we value ourselves and create value for others against this landscape. It's focused on Walter and navigates <i>Breaking Bad</i> as a story, but it also takes a fresh look at how topics of identity, behaviour, creativity and freedom apply to all of us.</p>
<p>There was a lot of support for the book in a previous Kickstarter campaign earlier this month. We raised almost 70% of the funding goal, and wanted to give backers another opportunity to support on a more flexible platform. i.e. one that allows us to use what we do raise towards the book's production (as opposed to Kickstarter's all or nothing model, which it turns out wasn't the right fit.).<br/></p>
<h3>Who is Walter?</h3>
<p>If you haven't seen the <i>Breaking Bad</i> TV series yet, here's a quick run-down on Walter: He's a struggling high school chemistry teacher, diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer. In a bid to secure his family's financial future before he dies, Walter turns to a life of crime, producing crystallized meth from an old RV, and selling it via his accomplice and former student, Jesse Pinkman.</p>
<p></p>

<h3>Why this book?</h3>
<p>There's a reason <i>Breaking Bad</i> is the highest rated drama in TV history: We all experience some degree of Walter’s circumstances. His problems are likely to confront each of us, if they haven't already: <b>scarcity of money, health, time, control and meaning</b>. On the flip side, the massive opportunities he couldn't see for himself are not always clear to us, in our own stories, either. That's why I've written this book. Not just to rehash a cautionary tale, but to explore what's possible in terms of career, lifestyle and enterprise for ourselves and for our families.</p>
<h3>What Went Wrong with... Richard?</h3>
<p>I love to write. Probably about as much as Walter loves Chemistry. Writing has always been central to adding value in my career. <br/><br/>So, years ago, when I found myself stuck in a cubicle, unhappy, and not writing at all, “What went wrong?’ was a question I asked… a lot (and a lot less politely). Like Walter, without meaning to, I wound up in the place following a path that appeared to be safe-- sensible even, but mediocre. The results were telling: it showed up in my levels of happiness, satisfaction, and my general health. </p>
<p>As one of my friends used to say,<b> it's either choice or crisis that gets us out of these places</b>. Like Walter, mine was the latter. The pragmatic career path I had tried to hold together, began to break apart. It wasn't dramatic, or even sudden like Walter’s earth-shattering news, but it led to a listless stagnation that stopped me performing at my best. </p>
<p>So, I too purchased an RV and headed for the boonies… just kidding. One thing that was clear though: I had to find a vehicle and start experimenting with the thing that weren't working. it was definitely an “I am awake” season of life for me. I decided I wanted a better life for me and the people around me. Using insight and approaches I discuss in the book, I’ve...</p>

<p>Today, my life is <i>far</i> from perfect, but I’m grateful it's also far from what it used to be. </p>
<h3>How you can help</h3>
<p>Walter was right about one thing: ""You and I will not make garbage"", not if you can help it, and you can! Here's how:</p>
<p>By backing this book, you’re helping to lead the charge on an important mission: <b>getting more from the staggering amounts of media we consume</b>. I love entertainment, but I also love progress.  If it's true that we occupy an unprecedented place in history, then we all need to start experimenting: in career, in business, in relationships, and in our art. I've written this book to help people do just that.</p>

Campaign Summary</b></p>
<p>First
and foremost, thanks for stopping by!</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>A
little personal background…</b></p>
<p>My
name is Jason Kucharik, the creator of Authors For Change (or AFC), and I’m the author of VOK or Variable Operations Knowledge<span>.  Before I explain what AFC or VOK is all about, I’d like to take
a minute to tell you about myself.  Three years ago I found my passion in
writing and have been working to develop my craft ever since.  My first book was part of a fantasy trilogy I
created titled Fear Your Fate.  After
that started to get some attention on Wattpad, I co-authored a science fiction
book called Project Aspire with three other authors, one of whom was Taran
Matharu, the first male author to receive a publishing deal from his success on
Wattpad.  Shortly after that I started
writing VOK, my first military science fiction book.  A few months ago, Fledging, my first try at a
short story was published as part of an anthology called Brave New Girls which
centers around strong, young, female protagonists. The purpose of this
anthology is to raise money for a scholarship fund through the Society of Women
Engineers.  </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>What’s
is Authors For Change? </b></p>
<p>Authors
For Change is an organization that’s very dear to my heart.  Author For Change will use traditional media,
social media, and good old fashioned word of mouth to spread the work of
self-published authors who want to create change in the world.  Everyone
wants to make money doing what they love, but Authors For Change is about more
than just padding your pocket; it's about creating real change.  The initial wave of authors who are participating in Authors For Change have picked the following non-profits/charities for their book's proceeds... </p><p>To Write Love On Her Arms  <a href=""https://twloha.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://twloha.com/</a></p><p>It Gets Better Project​ <a href=""http://www.itgetsbetter.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.itgetsbetter.org/</a> </p><p>Society of Women Engineers​  <a href=""http://societyofwomenengineers.swe.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://societyofwomenengineers.swe.org/</a></p><p> Feeding America​  <a href=""http://www.feedingamerica.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.feedingamerica.org/</a></p><p>Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)​  <a href=""https://www.eff.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.eff.org/</a></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>The
Impact</b></p>
<p>The
AFC campaign is about myself and others using our talents to create an
organization that will impact the world.  Brainstorming ways to market VOK
is how I came up with the idea of Authors For Change.  I want to take my
talents and use them for positive change instead of just furthering my own
career.  With your support, we can make that happen.  With your
support, other authors can contribute to the Authors For Change campaign and we
can raise a hell of a lot of money to support charities that fight depression,
feed the hungry, fight for equality, help veterans in need, fight against the
cruelty of animals, support research against terminal conditions, and many,
many, more.  With your support, Authors For Change can be the start of
something great and help create real change in the world. </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>How
does it work?</b></p>
<p>Authors
For Change is still in the very early stages, and this Indie GoGo campaign is
being done to raise money to get it off the ground.  The first campaign will be done with some
authors that I personally know, to see if the program will not only work, but
to iron out any kinks that will arise. 
After the first campaign is done, we will move on to a secondary campaign
with more authors, then a third, and so on. 
The general idea is this...</p>
<p>Authors
who wish to work with Authors For Change will submit a portion of their work,
and a short explanation as to what charity they'd like to support and why for
review.  If picked, participating authors will sign a publishing contract with Authors For Change for the duration of the program.  Authors For Change will work with the
charities that the authors have picked to make them aware of who we are and
have them spread the word about the books in our program.  For spreading the word about our work, each
author participating in the program will donate 100% of the proceeds from the first
thousand copies of their work to the charity of their choice.  After the
initial thousand copies, authors are required to continue donating at least 20%
of their proceeds to the charity of their choice for one whole year.  They
may choose to donate more, or continue donating past the one year mark if they
so choose.  A small percentage of sales is goes into Authors For
Change to help cover operating costs and the continuation of the program.
 The remaining amount of the sales go to the author.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>We
only work with people who are committed to change</b></p>
<p>Authors
For Change is creating a movement where people can use their passions to help
those in need.  If making a quick buck is your goal, then Authors For
Change is not for you.  Our organization will allow authors to pool their
networks and utilize the charity's networks to get exposure and thus create a
much larger fan base for their work than would be possible on their own, but
that is secondary to our primary goal.  We want to prove that there are
still plenty of great people in this world who wish to support causes that
offer hope and change for those who need it.  The authors we’re looking to
work with are constantly asking what else they can do to help, not how much
money they’ll make.  Becoming a
contributor in the AFC campaign is about helping myself and others create an
organization that plans to change the world for the better, as best we can,
with the talents we have.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>The
number of individuals interested in supporting Authors For Change just
continues to grow and I’m looking to raise $5,000 to help get things off the
ground.  I'm sure you're wondering what the proceeds are going towards, so
let me break it down…</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>$500
Legitimizing Authors For Change</b> – At this point, Authors For Change is
merely an idea, but myself and a core group of members I’ve recruited are
itching to make it a reality.  We’re a collection of authors, artists, and
editors who want to become a force for good in the world, and we need your
help.  Step one to making that happen is legitimizing Authors For Change
as an organization.  Authors For Change
will start out in the form of an LCC with contracts written up for the
participating authors.  This $500 will be used to hire a lawyer to set up the LLC and review the contracts we plan to set in place.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">  The main goal in
the future is to make AFC a non-profit organization, but the flexibility of an
LLC will allow us to get started faster and figure out what works and what
doesn't.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>$1,200
for Brand Creation</b> –
Brand recognition is huge for any new organization.  After making AFC a legitimate organization,
we’ll be hiring a professional graphic artist to create a professional brand in
the form of a logo and website.  It is
key that charities understand how serious AFC is and how serious the people
supporting it are.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>$2,200
Editing </b>–
VOK is the first book to support Authors For Change, so ensuring VOK is
available as a professional product is my number one concern.  My father
always taught me that if you are going to take the time to do something, then
you better damn well do it right.  The end product of VOK that I’ll be publishing
is light years ahead of the pre-edited copy that’s available on Wattpad, making
it a very strong forerunning to drive attention toward AFC.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>$1,100
Indie GoGo Campaign Promotional Costs–</b> This is to cover the creation of all the
promotional prizes offered in the Indie GoGo campaign.     </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Additional
Funds Raised - </b>Any
additional funds raised from the campaign will be put into Authors For Change
to help make it more successful, this includes website upkeep, online or
traditional marketing, and more.  The $1,500 that I've allocated for its
creation is just the beginning.    </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Risks
&amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>As
with any project or organization, there are risks and challenges
involved.  With Authors For Change it really comes down to funding.  If AFC is going to approach these charities
in a professional manner, then it needs to legalized, branded, and have
information about the program clearly laid out and available.  Legal documents need to be drawn up before we
reach out to the charities we hope to work with.  If VOK is to be the first book to launch
Authors For Change into reality, then it needs to be properly edited.  At this current time, anyone involved in AFC is volunteering because they want to help make a difference, and believe in the movement.  Should the first official AFC campaign of books go well, then I shall reassess the needs and proceed accordingly.  My long term goal is to run AFC full time.     </p>
<p>I <i>know </i>that
AFC will be a success, there’s no doubt in my mind.  It’s only a matter of
time and dedication.  I’m asking you to
trust in my desire to do good, and trust in my vision as the people already
working with AFC have.  With your help,
we can ensure Authors For Change will become a reality, affording it the
opportunity to help more people as soon as possible. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Other
Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>Some
of you can't contribute, and trust me I understand that.  As someone
taking to Indie GoGo to help fund an idea, I know what it’s like to be tight on
funds, but that doesn't mean that you can't help.</p>
<p>I
need you to spread the word about Authors For Change and VOK.  Share this
link on Twitter and Facebook.  Take a screenshot of the campaign and
upload it to Instragram.  Tell others by word of mouth, or any means
possible.  Whenever it’s with an online
platform, please remember to use the hashtags #VOK, #AFC, and #indiegogo to
help people find it easier. </p>
<p>If
you can’t contribute, all that I ask is you take a few seconds to help spread
the word about what I’m trying to accomplish.  Thank you for your contributions,

Campaign Summary
First
and foremost, thanks for stopping by!

A
little personal background…
My
name is Jason Kucharik, the creator of Authors For Change (or AFC), and I’m the author of VOK or Variable Operations Knowledge.  Before I explain what AFC or VOK is all about, I’d like to take
a minute to tell you about myself.  Three years ago I found my passion in
writing and have been working to develop my craft ever since.  My first book was part of a fantasy trilogy I
created titled Fear Your Fate.  After
that started to get some attention on Wattpad, I co-authored a science fiction
book called Project Aspire with three other authors, one of whom was Taran
Matharu, the first male author to receive a publishing deal from his success on
Wattpad.  Shortly after that I started
writing VOK, my first military science fiction book.  A few months ago, Fledging, my first try at a
short story was published as part of an anthology called Brave New Girls which
centers around strong, young, female protagonists. The purpose of this
anthology is to raise money for a scholarship fund through the Society of Women
Engineers.  

What’s
is Authors For Change? 
Authors
For Change is an organization that’s very dear to my heart.  Author For Change will use traditional media,
social media, and good old fashioned word of mouth to spread the work of
self-published authors who want to create change in the world.  Everyone
wants to make money doing what they love, but Authors For Change is about more
than just padding your pocket; it's about creating real change.  The initial wave of authors who are participating in Authors For Change have picked the following non-profits/charities for their book's proceeds... To Write Love On Her Arms  https://twloha.com/It Gets Better Project​ http://www.itgetsbetter.org/ Society of Women Engineers​  http://societyofwomenengineers.swe.org/ Feeding America​  http://www.feedingamerica.org/Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)​  https://www.eff.org/
The
Impact
The
AFC campaign is about myself and others using our talents to create an
organization that will impact the world.  Brainstorming ways to market VOK
is how I came up with the idea of Authors For Change.  I want to take my
talents and use them for positive change instead of just furthering my own
career.  With your support, we can make that happen.  With your
support, other authors can contribute to the Authors For Change campaign and we
can raise a hell of a lot of money to support charities that fight depression,
feed the hungry, fight for equality, help veterans in need, fight against the
cruelty of animals, support research against terminal conditions, and many,
many, more.  With your support, Authors For Change can be the start of
something great and help create real change in the world. 
How
does it work?
Authors
For Change is still in the very early stages, and this Indie GoGo campaign is
being done to raise money to get it off the ground.  The first campaign will be done with some
authors that I personally know, to see if the program will not only work, but
to iron out any kinks that will arise. 
After the first campaign is done, we will move on to a secondary campaign
with more authors, then a third, and so on. 
The general idea is this...
Authors
who wish to work with Authors For Change will submit a portion of their work,
and a short explanation as to what charity they'd like to support and why for
review.  If picked, participating authors will sign a publishing contract with Authors For Change for the duration of the program.  Authors For Change will work with the
charities that the authors have picked to make them aware of who we are and
have them spread the word about the books in our program.  For spreading the word about our work, each
author participating in the program will donate 100% of the proceeds from the first
thousand copies of their work to the charity of their choice.  After the
initial thousand copies, authors are required to continue donating at least 20%
of their proceeds to the charity of their choice for one whole year.  They
may choose to donate more, or continue donating past the one year mark if they
so choose.  A small percentage of sales is goes into Authors For
Change to help cover operating costs and the continuation of the program.
 The remaining amount of the sales go to the author.

We
only work with people who are committed to change
Authors
For Change is creating a movement where people can use their passions to help
those in need.  If making a quick buck is your goal, then Authors For
Change is not for you.  Our organization will allow authors to pool their
networks and utilize the charity's networks to get exposure and thus create a
much larger fan base for their work than would be possible on their own, but
that is secondary to our primary goal.  We want to prove that there are
still plenty of great people in this world who wish to support causes that
offer hope and change for those who need it.  The authors we’re looking to
work with are constantly asking what else they can do to help, not how much
money they’ll make.  Becoming a
contributor in the AFC campaign is about helping myself and others create an
organization that plans to change the world for the better, as best we can,
with the talents we have.
What We Need & What You Get
The
number of individuals interested in supporting Authors For Change just
continues to grow and I’m looking to raise $5,000 to help get things off the
ground.  I'm sure you're wondering what the proceeds are going towards, so
let me break it down…

Legitimizing Authors For Change – At this point, Authors For Change is

VOK's
description and what readers are saying about it ...

Earth has burned; my people made sure the
humans paid for their insolence in the final days of the Blood War, but as it
turns out the universe is pretty freaking huge and they weren’t the only
threat.  Not by a long shot.
I’m an Alpha, one of the
most feared special operations soldiers in the universe.  Born out of
blood, I am the eyes and ears of the High Order and, when need be, their
unflinching reaper.  I do not yield, I do not bow, I do not fail.
 Ever. 
For centuries our
loyalty was unquestionable, but my partner and I uncovered a dark secret about
our past that calls into question our entire lives.  The High Order
trained us to be the most intelligent, ruthless, and feared soldiers ever
created…they’re going to regret that.

<h3>Quelle est l'origine du projet?</h3>
<p>Le journal La Presse du 14 novembre 2014 (p. 7) a dressé un bilan de la situation philanthropique au Québec. De 2008 à 2014, le secteur philanthropique du Québec a accusé <strong>« un manque à gagner de quelque 500 millions de dollars »</strong>.</p>
<p>Interrogée à ce sujet par le journal La Presse, Danielle Poulin, membre du comité exécutif de l’Association des professionnels en gestion philanthropique (APGP), a fait le bilan diagnostic suivant :</p>
<p><strong>« La tarte des dons [provenant d’entreprises] n’augmente pas. L’argent est dans les mains des individus. Or comme l’État est en décroissance, on a une culture philanthropique à développer au Québec.» </strong></p>
<p>L’équipe de Toastzr a finalement compris qu’au Québec les gens donnent, mais attendent quelque chose en échange. Notre équipe a alors imaginé le concept « un toast à la cause! » Le concept est basé sur la prémisse que manger étant culturel, le partage de repas pour une bonne cause peut faire tomber les barrières humaines tout en nourrissant le geste philanthropique.</p>
<p>Nous avons alors décidé de développer une appli pour valoriser ce concept avec le but de contribuer au développement de la culture philanthropique au Québec, voire dans tout le Canada.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Quelle est l’offre de services et comment ça marche?</h3>
<p>Toastzr fournit des services de référencement et d’échange. Ces services favorisent l’émission et l’achat de « bons de repas » permettant de partager un repas pour une bonne cause. Voici comment cela fonctionne : </p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">vous achetez un bon de repas d’un établissement participant;</span><br/>

<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">votre engagement social est valorisé.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>Soulignons que 75 % des fonds levés à travers Toastzr vont à la cause. Ainsi, Toastzr sera plus généreuse que la moyenne des fondations au Québec, à 74 % (Les affaires, 30 novembre 2013).</p>
<br/>
<p>Pour favoriser l’engagement social de tous, Toastzr interviendra dans sept (7) domaines philanthropiques de priorité<br/><br/></p>

<p><span>Avec Toastzr, soutenir une bonne cause devient une expérience avec un bon de repas. Car les valeurs de Toastzr sont diversité, collaboration, plaisir et partage pour assurer des revenus complémentaires à divers organismes.</span></p>En fait, nous visons un idéal social. Notre mission est tout simplement de promouvoir un monde interculturel et solidaire autour du partage de repas pour une bonne cause.</div>

<h3>Quel est le cadre de gestion des risques relatifs à ce projet?</h3>
<p>Projet géré dans le cadre d’une entreprise coopérative. Or dans le contexte du Québec, selon le Conseil québécois de la coopération et de la mutualité, les entreprises coopératives présentent un taux de survie nettement plus élevé que les entreprises traditionnelles, et ce, après cinq ans (62 % contre 35 %) ou dix ans (44 % contre 20 %).</p>
<p>Projet validé par une étude de marché concluante. Deux importants organismes ont participé au financement de cette étude, soient le Réseau d’investissement social du Québec (RISQ) et le Centre local de développement (CLD) de Shawinigan. L’étude a été réalisée par le cabinet Zins Beauchesne et associés (ZBA), qui possède plus de 30 ans d’expertise-conseil en marketing, développement et innovation.</p>
<p>Projet exploité à partir d’un établissement stimulant. Toastzr s’est installée le 1er août 2015 au Digihub Shawinigan, important pôle du numérique au Québec. L’interaction avec d’autres entreprises du numérique et l’accès à une infrastructure technologique de pointe sont des atouts pour le succès.</p>

<h2>For the development of a philanthropic culture in the province of Quebec, Canada.</h2>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How did the project originate?</h3>
<p><span>The November 14, 2014 issue of La Presse newspaper (pg. 7) made a review of the philanthropic sector in the province of Quebec, Canada, from 2008 to 2014, and found that there was a loss of income of 500 million dollars.</span></p>
<p>Danielle Poulin, a member of the executive committee for the <i>Association des professionnels en gestion philanthropique</i> (APGP; the Association of professionals in philanthropic management), makes the following diagnostic in an interview given to the newspaper: </p>
<p><b>""<i>The [share of the] pie for corporate donations is not growing. Money is in the hands of individuals, and since the Government's share is decreasing, there is a philanthropic culture to be developed in the province of Quebec</i>"" </b>(free translation).</p>
<p>The Toastzr team has come to understand that people in the province of Quebec do give, but they expect something in return. So our team came up with the concept ""Raise a Toast to the Cause!"" This concept is based on the premise that since eating is a cultural gesture, sharing a meal for a good cause could help bring down human barriers while encouraging a philanthropic act as well.</p>
<p>Therefore we have decided to develop an app to promote this concept, with the goal of contributing to the development of a philanthropic culture in the province of Quebec, and even in Canada, from coast to coast.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3><span>What is the proposal, and how does it work?</span></h3>
<p><span>Toastzr offers to reference and exchange services. These services facilitate issuing and buying a MEAL VOUCHER which allows people to share a meal for a good cause. Here is how it works: </span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">you buy a MEAL VOUCHER from a participating establishment;</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">you eat to support a cause that is meaningful to you;</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">your social involvement grows.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>We must emphasize that 75% of the funds raised through Toastzr go to the cause. Therefore, Toastzr will be more generous than average charitable foundations in the province of Quebec at 74% (Les affaires; November 30, 2013).</p>
<br/>
<p>To encourage everyone's social commitment, Toastzr will promote seven philanthropic domains of priority:<br/><br/></p>

<h3><span>What is distinctive about this app?</span></h3>

<p><span>With Toastzr, a MEAL VOUCHER becomes the means to experience supporting a good cause, because Toastzr's values are diversity, collaboration, pleasure and sharing, in order to ensure complementary income to various organizations.</span></p>In fact, we aim for a social ideal. Our mission is simply to promote a united, intercultural world through sharing a meal for a good cause.</div>

<h3>What is the business behind this project?</h3>
<p><span>Toastzr Inter Coop is the solidarity cooperative, in accordance with Canadian laws, which has developed the toastzr.com app. Toastzr is thus a social business with values and principles that define a social economy: </span></p>

</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What is the risk management frame for this project?</h3>
<p><span>The project is managed as a cooperative enterprise. And in Quebec, according to the Conseil québécois de la coopération et de la mutualité (Quebec counsel for cooperation and mutuality), cooperative enterprises have a survival rate higher than traditional businesses, even after 5 years (62% against 35%) or 10 years (44% against 20%).</span></p>
<p>The project has been validated by a conclusive market study. Two important organizations helped to finance the study: the Réseau d'investissement social du Québec (RISQ; Quebec social investment network), and the Centre local de développement de Shawinigan (CLD; Shawinigan local development centre). The study was done by Zins Beauchesne and Associates (ZBA), which has more than 30 years of consulting experience in marketing, development and innovation.</p>
<p>The project is run within a stimulating environment. On August 1st, 2015, Toastzr established its office at Digihub Shawinigan, which is a major centre for digital technology in the province of Quebec. Interaction with other digital businesses and access to the latest technological infrastructure are assets for success.</p>

Le journal La Presse du 14 novembre 2014 (p. 7) a dressé un bilan de la situation philanthropique au Québec. De 2008 à 2014, le secteur philanthropique du Québec a accusé « un manque à gagner de quelque 500 millions de dollars ».
Interrogée à ce sujet par le journal La Presse, Danielle Poulin, membre du comité exécutif de l’Association des professionnels en gestion philanthropique (APGP), a fait le bilan diagnostic suivant :
« La tarte des dons [provenant d’entreprises] n’augmente pas. L’argent est dans les mains des individus. Or comme l’État est en décroissance, on a une culture philanthropique à développer au Québec.» 
L’équipe de Toastzr a finalement compris qu’au Québec les gens donnent, mais attendent quelque chose en échange. Notre équipe a alors imaginé le concept « un toast à la cause! » Le concept est basé sur la prémisse que manger étant culturel, le partage de repas pour une bonne cause peut faire tomber les barrières humaines tout en nourrissant le geste philanthropique.
Nous avons alors décidé de développer une appli pour valoriser ce concept avec le but de contribuer au développement de la culture philanthropique au Québec, voire dans tout le Canada.


Quelle est l’offre de services et comment ça marche?
Toastzr fournit des services de référencement et d’échange. Ces services favorisent l’émission et l’achat de « bons de repas » permettant de partager un repas pour une bonne cause. Voici comment cela fonctionne : 


vous achetez un bon de repas d’un établissement participant;


vous mangez pour soutenir une cause qui vous tient à cœur;


votre engagement social est valorisé.



Soulignons que 75 % des fonds levés à travers Toastzr vont à la cause. Ainsi, Toastzr sera plus généreuse que la moyenne des fondations au Québec, à 74 % (Les affaires, 30 novembre 2013).

Pour favoriser l’engagement social de tous, Toastzr interviendra dans sept (7) domaines philanthropiques de priorité





la santé et les services sociaux ;


l’éducation ;


l’aide internationale ;


les causes humanitaires d’urgence ;


les arts et la culture ;


l’environnement ;


l’intervention communautaire.




Qu’est-ce qui distingue l’application?

Avec Toastzr, soutenir une bonne cause devient une expérience avec un bon de repas. Car les valeurs de Toastzr sont diversité, collaboration, plaisir et partage pour assurer des revenus complémentaires à divers organismes.En fait, nous visons un idéal social. Notre mission est tout simplement de promouvoir un monde interculturel et solidaire autour du partage de repas pour une bonne cause.

Quelle est l’entreprise derrière ce projet?
Toastzr Inter Coop est la coopérative de solidarité de droit canadien qui a développé l’appli toastzr.com. Toastzr est ainsi une entreprise sociale avec des valeurs et principes qui définissent l’économie sociale : 


prise en charge collective ;


processus démocratique ;


primauté de la personne sur le capital ;


production de biens ou services socialement utiles.




Quel est le cadre de gestion des risques relatifs à ce projet?
Projet géré dans le cadre d’une entreprise coopérative. Or dans le contexte du Québec, selon le Conseil québécois de la coopération et de la mutualité, les entreprises coopératives présentent un taux de survie nettement plus élevé que les entreprises traditionnelles, et ce, après cinq ans (62 % contre 35 %) ou dix ans (44 % contre 20 %).
Projet validé par une étude de marché concluante. Deux importants organismes ont participé au financement de cette étude, soient le Réseau d’investissement social du Québec (RISQ) et le Centre local de développement (CLD) de Shawinigan. L’étude a été réalisée par le cabinet Zins Beauchesne et associés (ZBA), qui possède plus de 30 ans d’expertise-conseil en marketing, développement et innovation.
Projet exploité à partir d’un établissement stimulant. Toastzr s’est installée le 1er août 2015 au Digihub Shawinigan, important pôle du numérique au Québec. L’interaction avec d’autres entreprises du numérique et l’accès à une infrastructure technologique de pointe sont des atouts pour le succès.

For the development of a philanthropic culture in the province of Quebec, Canada.


How did the project originate?
The November 14, 2014 issue of La Presse newspaper (pg. 7) made a review of the philanthropic sector in the province of Quebec, Canada, from 2008 to 2014, and found that there was a loss of income of 500 million dollars.
Danielle Poulin, a member of the executive committee for the Association des professionnels en gestion philanthropique (APGP; the Association of professionals in philanthropic management), makes the following diagnostic in an interview given to the newspaper: 
""The [share of the] pie for corporate donations is not growing. Money is in the hands of individuals, and since the Government's share is decreasing, there is a philanthropic culture to be developed in the province of Quebec"" (free translation).
The Toastzr team has come to understand that people in the province of Quebec do give, but they expect something in return. So our team came up with the concept ""Raise a Toast to the Cause!"" This concept is based on the premise that since eating is a cultural gesture, sharing a meal for a good cause could help bring down human barriers while encouraging a philanthropic act as well.
Therefore we have decided to develop an app to promote this concept, with the goal of contributing to the development of a philanthropic culture in the province of Quebec, and even in Canada, from coast to coast.


What is the proposal, and how does it work?
Toastzr offers to reference and exchange services. These services facilitate issuing and buying a MEAL VOUCHER which allows people to share a meal for a good cause. Here is how it works: 


you buy a MEAL VOUCHER from a participating establishment;


you eat to support a cause that is meaningful to you;


your social involvement grows.



We must emphasize that 75% of the funds raised through Toastzr go to the cause. Therefore, Toastzr will be more generous than average charitable foundations in the province of Quebec at 74% (Les affaires; November 30, 2013).

To encourage everyone's social commitment, Toastzr will promote seven philanthropic domains of priority:



health and social services;


education;


international aid;


emergency humanitarian causes;


arts and culture;


environment;


community intervention.




What is distinctive about this app?

With Toastzr, a MEAL VOUCHER becomes the means to experience supporting a good cause, because Toastzr's values are diversity, collaboration, pleasure and sharing, in order to ensure complementary income to various organizations.In fact, we aim for a social ideal. Our mission is simply to promote a united, intercultural world through sharing a meal for a good cause.

What is the business behind this project?
Toastzr Inter Coop is the solidarity cooperative, in accordance with Canadian laws, which has developed the toastzr.com app. Toastzr is thus a social business with values and principles that define a social economy: 


collective endeavour;


democratic process;


the priority of people over capital;


production of socially useful goods and services.




What is the risk management frame for this project?
The project is managed as a cooperative enterprise. And in Quebec, according to the Conseil québécois de la coopération et de la mutualité (Quebec counsel for cooperation and mutuality), cooperative enterprises have a survival rate higher than traditional businesses, even after 5 years (62% against 35%) or 10 years (44% against 20%).
The project has been validated by a conclusive market study. Two important organizations helped to finance the study: the Réseau d'investissement social du Québec (RISQ; Quebec social investment network), and the Centre local de développement de Shawinigan (CLD; Shawinigan local development centre). The study was done by Zins Beauchesne and Associates (ZBA), which has more than 30 years of consulting experience in marketing, development and innovation.
The project is run within a stimulating environment. On August 1st, 2015, Toastzr established its office at Digihub Shawinigan, which is a major centre for digital technology in the province of Quebec. Interaction with other digital businesses and access to the latest technological infrastructure are assets for success.


Invitations
Your contribution will help us to establish this social business project in an efficient way. You will thus contribute to the development of a philanthropic culture in the province of Quebec. Wouldn't you want to become an agent of social change?

Therefore, our funding needs are estimated at $200,000 out of a total of $333,955 in order to promote the efficient implementation of Toastzr an important social business project.

<h3><br/></h3>
<div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">CliniqFinder is a beautifully designed website for booking appointments with the doctors you love near you. Designed for accommodating hundreds of doctors and thousands of patients' accounts, it's a website designed to provide all necessary information for booking the right private doctor, who will have his own web page complete with photos, CVs, reviews, treatments, prices, location on a map and special deals.</span></div>
<div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We have been designing and custom building websites that have millions of visits for over five years. We custom built our first cloud storage reviews website in 2013, and during this process we discovered that reviews are very powerful in making people decide what to buy or use; reviews drive a lot of traffic to businesses, they are trusted because made by real customers and according to Amazon's report they are good also when they are negative as well. With CliniqFinder we wanted to give doctors the possibility to improve their reputation with transparency, reviews, pricing, treatments all available online on Cliniqfinder with a beautiful website that is easy to use and allows instant bookings of appointments.<br/></span></div>
<div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We have always booked online holidays, cars, travels, flights, why can't we also book doctors appointments? </span></div>

<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The project author's name is Luca Tagliaferro, he is an experienced web marketing professional. The second team member is a web developer, Davide, working at the moment as a Senior Team Manager for a technology company. We are both italians living in the UK. The idea of Cliniqfinder started actually 1 year ago when I was looking for a dentist for me toothache in the south of England. This experience was really frustrating for me because I couldn't find and compare prices, treatments, location so I ended up going googling. But also on Google I couldn't find any information so I got so frustrated to the point where I said to myself: ""let's build a website that allows people find a book a doctor online in a few minutes"".</span><br/>
</div>
<div>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The reason this campaign is important to me is twofold. First of all, I grew up in a family of doctors and when I was a kid and my dad was working as a GP in the 80s and 90s, I used to answer the phone at all times during the day and the night when my dad wasn't there to pick it up. Patients wanted to book an appointment with him. </span><br/></p>
</div>
<p>Second, I believe the Internet is a huge opportunity to migrate all clinics' appointments from the phone to the web, thus making the administration and the marketing of doctors a much easier and straightforward thing to do. This implies a strong technology service and this is how Cliniqfinder comes to help. It allows two things: </p>
<p>1. Reducing the amount of work and time doctors spend on looking for new patients;</p>
<p>2. Helping patients to find and book the best available deal for the treatment they request.</p>
<p>Not much has changed today since the 90s when I used to pick up the phone for my dad and he used to make appointments and sign them on a paper. Still now many clinics and practices in the private sector do this, they rely on pen and paper. The paradox is that we can book holidays and hotels online, why can't we also book doctors? </p>

<br/>
<div>
<b>Final product development:</b> It is possible that there will need to be subtle changes to the software by development requirements. We will continue to iterate on development and pre-production to minimize the impact of these changes. Of course, we believe that any changes will be in an effort to improve the final product, and we will keep our backers posted about any such changes.

<div>
<b>Doctors' approach to patients: </b>Doctors are traditionalists, like I said before, from our market research already completed, we found out they prefer to speak directly to their patients rather than receiving bookings from a software, they prefer personal interaction. This risk is due to lack of information and communication, doctors don't understand what Cliniqfinder can do for them, we are developing this project not only to help them manage their bookings, but also to help them get found online. So to overcome this risk of doctors not understanding our product, we need to communicate better with doctors, promote Cliniqfinder as their partner in marketing and online booking.</div>
<div>
<b>Competitors: </b>Bigger companies are already developing similar projects. Millions of pounds are invested in these types of online appointments, we cannot compete with them on this level.

<div>
<b>Fulfillment:</b> if demand is greater than expected, this could impact the server's capacity to maintain such a high number of patients and doctors' accounts. We will strive to ensure that our fulfillment process and resources (both internal and external) are scaled up appropriately, based on response from the campaign.<br/>

<h3>FAQs</h3>

</div><div><br/></div></div>","What is CliniqFinder? 

CliniqFinder is a beautifully designed website for booking appointments with the doctors you love near you. Designed for accommodating hundreds of doctors and thousands of patients' accounts, it's a website designed to provide all necessary information for booking the right private doctor, who will have his own web page complete with photos, CVs, reviews, treatments, prices, location on a map and special deals.
We have been designing and custom building websites that have millions of visits for over five years. We custom built our first cloud storage reviews website in 2013, and during this process we discovered that reviews are very powerful in making people decide what to buy or use; reviews drive a lot of traffic to businesses, they are trusted because made by real customers and according to Amazon's report they are good also when they are negative as well. With CliniqFinder we wanted to give doctors the possibility to improve their reputation with transparency, reviews, pricing, treatments all available online on Cliniqfinder with a beautiful website that is easy to use and allows instant bookings of appointments.
We have always booked online holidays, cars, travels, flights, why can't we also book doctors appointments? 
Cliniqfinder team and story

The project author's name is Luca Tagliaferro, he is an experienced web marketing professional. The second team member is a web developer, Davide, working at the moment as a Senior Team Manager for a technology company. We are both italians living in the UK. The idea of Cliniqfinder started actually 1 year ago when I was looking for a dentist for me toothache in the south of England. This experience was really frustrating for me because I couldn't find and compare prices, treatments, location so I ended up going googling. But also on Google I couldn't find any information so I got so frustrated to the point where I said to myself: ""let's build a website that allows people find a book a doctor online in a few minutes"".


The reason this campaign is important to me is twofold. First of all, I grew up in a family of doctors and when I was a kid and my dad was working as a GP in the 80s and 90s, I used to answer the phone at all times during the day and the night when my dad wasn't there to pick it up. Patients wanted to book an appointment with him. 

Second, I believe the Internet is a huge opportunity to migrate all clinics' appointments from the phone to the web, thus making the administration and the marketing of doctors a much easier and straightforward thing to do. This implies a strong technology service and this is how Cliniqfinder comes to help. It allows two things: 
1. Reducing the amount of work and time doctors spend on looking for new patients;
2. Helping patients to find and book the best available deal for the treatment they request.
Not much has changed today since the 90s when I used to pick up the phone for my dad and he used to make appointments and sign them on a paper. Still now many clinics and practices in the private sector do this, they rely on pen and paper. The paradox is that we can book holidays and hotels online, why can't we also book doctors? 

Where we are in development:


Design – We have already completed our design and the first layouts for all website pages with Photoshop

Relationships with doctors –We have established a great working relationship with some local doctors ready to test the app and start receiving online appointments to their clinic.

Business plan - The marketing, business and sales plan has already been written in over 100 document pages;

Development of the website - As of December 2014,development started and you can see it here: http://www.cliniqfinder.com




What We Need 


  We need £15,000 to start building the website front-end and back-end according to the highest technical standards to allocate accounts for hundreds of doctors and thousands of patients every day.  We have costs for hosting the website;
Testing the website, new patients will have some issues probably and when we find out what issues they have we will have to spend money to fix them.  
What you get as a patient
This is how the results page will look like for patients, showing a map, available appointments and more information about doctors:




This what the main home page for doctors will look like:



   For Patients - 100% free use of Cliniqfinder

From the patient point of view, this is what you can do with Cliniqfinder for free:
1. Search for doctors. Search for the type of treatment on the search bar and then add the location near you. We provide dozens of different treatments and doctors in your area, it will be easy for you to find a doctor you love. This is an easy to use tool that will save you so much time and frustrations, all those problems that you have when searching online for a doctor.
2.Book real time appointments. Possibly the most important service of Cliniqfinder, because it will allow you to find an available appointment for the doctor you love. And consider time slots and location when deciding which doctor you need and answer your question: “Is my need an emergency or can I wait a couple of days?”.If your tooth aches badly you can find a doctor to book the same day. But maybe you want to simply avoid the unlimited waiting on the phone with the clinic’s assistant, or maybe you want to book an appointment when the time suits you, weekends or evenings, when the clinic is closed and you can’t call them. Simply another way to book online: Cliniqfinder allows 24/7 bookings.
3.Get appointments confirmation. Booking an appointment is not the end of this service. Cliniqfinder will send you an email with the confirmation of your booking to make theprocess much more efficient and smooth. And you also get confirmation by SMS one day before you appointment is due to make sure you won’t forget it. You won’t have to remember anything, because Cliniqfinder will do it for you. You can simply keep focused on your daily activities and when the time comes, we will remind you of your appointment to your doctor.

4. Read or upload your review.Research shows that online reviews strongly influence the decision to choose a service since 73% of customers rely on reviews before making any type of decision online. This is the second most important service we offer, because it allows you to read other’s customers reviews that are verified by us. If you want to share with the world how fantastic your visit was, then all you have to do is reply to our email that will ask you to leave a review of your last visit.
5. Learn about wellness  and science issues. Cliniqfinder will have an up-to-date and informative blog where you can read on all topics related to your health, to the science, biology and wellness in general. Our articles have the main aim to share all this knowledge and are written by healthcare professionals and scientific researches. They will answer these type of questions: “How much information can our brain store?”. Or maybe you want to read about “Can peanut allergies be prevented?” or else “What does the dentist check on your first assessment?”. You can find answers to all these questions in our blog, we hope you will find it informative and interesting.

What we can do is make our product smarter than theirs, we can study their products and improve them before we go live, this is something we have already done but I won't go into much details here, I don't have the space. 

Fulfillment: if demand is greater than expected, this could impact the server's capacity to maintain such a high number of patients and doctors' accounts. We will strive to ensure that our fulfillment process and resources (both internal and external) are scaled up appropriately, based on response from the campaign.

<p align=""center""><b>Création de la LIREPOC – Ligue de Résistance Politique et
Citoyenne
</b></p>
<p>Depuis la seconde guerre mondiale, les européens sont colonisés par les Etats-unis
et forcés de pratiquer une politique sioniste favorable à Israël. Partout aux 4 coins du
monde, nos pays répandent le mal et font couler le sang des innocents en s'alliant
avec des pays immoraux pour lesquels l'homme n'a aucune valeur.
</p>
<p>En Europe, la démocratie est une notion de plus en plus vague. Les dirigeants
européens ne se gênent nullement pour donner des leçons de démocratie à
l’étranger alors qu’ils sont incapables de la respecter et de la mettre en œuvre dans
leurs propres pays. Le fossé entre les citoyens et leurs représentants politique ne
cesse de s’accroître. Les citoyens attendent un changement mais le pouvoir en place
empêche toute évolution.
</p>
<p><b>A cause des politiques criminelles de nos dirigeants, les attentats se
multiplient partout dans le monde. La peur se propage et la haine grandit. Si
nous ne réagissons pas, demain, ce sera le chaos !
</b></p>
<p>Si nous ne parvenons pas à changer en profondeur l’Europe et sa politique, si nous
ne détournons pas les pays européens de l’axe du mal, l’axe américano-sioniste, si
nous ne dénonçons pas les alliances de nos dirigeants avec des pays voyous
comme le Qatar et l’Arabie saoudite, le chaos continuera à se propager un peu
partout dans le monde mais surtout en Afrique, au Maghreb et au Moyen-Orient.
</p>
<p><b>Les manipulations médiatiques et politiques que nous connaissons actuellement font
de nous des esclaves des temps modernes</b>.
</p>
<p>Il est temps que le monde comprenne ce qui est en train de se jouer en ce moment.
Avec les attentats qui frappent l’Europe, la Russie et le Moyen-Orient, c'est la
stratégie du chaos qui est mise en oeuvre !
</p>
<p>Les attentats qui frappent l’Europe et différents pays qui ont connu ces
dernières années une vague de recolonisation poursuivent un objectif simple :
la création du Grand Israël et l’établissement d’un nouvel ordre mondial !
</p>
<p>Il faut créer la peur de l'autre au sein-même de l'Europe. <b>Diviser pour mieux régner !</b>
</p>
<p>Ainsi, les attentats de Paris de 2015 (comme d'autres avant eux) sont des attentats
qui poursuivent des objectifs purement politiques. Tout comme on veut nous
présenter des chefs d’Etat étrangers comme des dictateurs ou des bouchers, nos
politiques, aidés par les médias, qui ne sont plus que des organes de propagande,
veulent nous faire croire que ce sont des musulmans radicaux qui ont perpétré ces
attentats alors que ces gens sont en fait instrumentalisés, formés et manipulés par
les services secrets européens, américains et israéliens. Le but est de créer en
Europe un sentiment d'insécurité en pointant du doigt les musulmans comme les
responsables de cette insécurité qui ne cesse de s'étendre.
</p>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>
</p><div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<div>
<p>N’oublions pas que nos pays européens ont aidé, armé, équipé et financé DAESH en
Syrie directement et indirectement. N’oublions pas non plus que Ben Laden et Al
Quaïda ont bénéficié largement du soutien des USA et de la CIA.
</p>
<p>Avec ces attentats qui frappent l’Europe, tous les musulmans deviennent, pour
l'opinion publique manipulée par les médias, des terroristes potentiels. Tout est mis
en oeuvre pour vous démontrer que même votre jeune et gentille voisine de pallier
peut se transformer en kamikaze si elle est musulmane ! C'est édifiant ! C'est
extrêmement dangereux surtout que des attaques du même type au Mali ont, elles,
pour but de stigmatiser la population européenne d’origine africaine ! Désormais,
dans les transports en commun en Europe, les personnes typées africaines ou
arabes ne sont plus regardées de la même manière. La peur de l’autre se propage !
</p>
<p>La haine du monde arabe ne cesse d'augmenter dans nos pays et tout cela
poursuit 2 objectifs concrets:
</p>
<p><b>1)</b> <b>diviser la population de nos pays pour créer le chaos en Europe.</b> Imaginez
les dégâts qu'une telle démarche pourrait entraîner quand on sait que 10% de la
population belge est musulmane et qu'en France cette proportion monte à 20% de la
population. C'est donc la guerre civile que ceux qui montent ces attentats et les
déguisent en attentats islamistes poursuivent et veulent créer.
</p>
<p><b>2) donner des Musulmans une mauvaise image en Europe, c'est bon pour
Israël qui pourra continuer à massacrer les Palestiniens mais aussi ceux qui
oseront encore se mettre sur leur chemin</b>. Plus l'islamophobie progresse en
Europe et plus les frontières d'Israël s'étendent ! Après avoir déjà créé de fausses
révolutions dans certains pays du Maghreb et renversé la plus grande majorité des
Chefs d’Etat hostiles au sionisme, le projet de création du Grand Israël n’a jamais été
aussi près de se réaliser. Aujourd’hui, seuls la Syrie, l’Iran et la Russie s’y opposent encore...
</p>
<p><b>Il est donc primordial de s’organiser au sein-même de l’Europe mais aussi avec nos
alliés antisionistes dans le monde pour créer un front politique et citoyen de
résistance.
</b></p>
<p>Il est temps que les peuples d'Europe et du monde comprennent cette triste réalité
sinon, en moins de temps qu'il ne faut pour le dire, nos pays seront plongés dans la
guerre civile et le chaos. Le chaos est en effet la seule et unique manière de revoir le
monde et son fonctionnement. <b>Après chaque guerre mondiale, un nouvel ordre
s'établit. Le prochain, ce sera le Nouvel Ordre Mondial avec un gouvernement
mondial et sa capitale à Jérusalem, tout cela bien sûr au nom de la paix et de la lutte
contre le terrorisme. </b>A terme, tout le pouvoir sera entre les mains d'un groupe
minuscule et ceux qui ne s'y soumettront pas seront considérés comme des
terroristes qu'il faut éliminer ! Voilà le projet en cours, voilà comment ceux qui dirigent
veulent nous soumettre à l'esclavage moderne !
</p>
<p>Face à cette réalité, il est urgent de créer un front de la résistance regroupant
ceux qui, à travers le monde, refusent de s’allier avec l’axe du mal et
souhaitent s’opposer à l’impérialisme américain et au sionisme.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Conscient qu’en Europe la voie politique est actuellement bouchée à cause du
trucage des élections et parce que nous savons qu'aucun changement ne
viendra par le monde politique dont les personnalités ne sont mises en avant
que si elles ont vendu leur âme au diable, il est important de choisir une voie
plus souterraine qui puisse travailler sur le long terme sans se soucier des
échéances électorales.
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ce n’est donc pas un mouvement politique qu’il faut créer mais un lobby, un
groupe de pression. Les lobbys ne s'affichent pas ouvertement, ils travaillent
en sous-marin et c'est exactement ce que nous devons faire en unissant
toutes les personnalités et mouvements antisionistes dans le monde. Ce n'est
qu'ainsi que nous pourrons influer sur la société et sur les décisions de nos
élus.

<p align=""justify"">Actif pendant 4 ans au Parlement belge en tant que député, Laurent LOUIS
s’est rendu compte que le lobby sioniste était plus que puissant et imposait
ses vues et ses ordres à tous les politiciens d'Europe. En outre, à côté de ce
lobby puissant, d'autres lobbys règnent en maîtres absolus en Europe. Le
lobby de l'armement mais aussi les lobbys pharmaceutiques et agro-alimentaires. Nos élus sont totalement soumis à ces lobbys qui mènent la
danse au Parlement européen et dans nos parlements nationaux.
</p>
<p align=""justify"">Pour plaire à ces lobbys, tout est permis ! On crée des guerres aux 4 coins du
monde pour vendre des armes, on encourage les OGM dans notre
alimentation, on nous fait ingurgiter des produits néfastes et on nous gave de
médicaments pour mieux nous empoisonner.
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">N'oublions pas le projet morbide de Bill Gates qui veut réduire drastiquement
la population mondiale ! Pour ce faire, il faut des guerres, des attentats mais il
faut aussi empoisonner les citoyens et les méthodes sont nombreuses
(médicaments, chemtrails, OGM, vaccins, drogues, etc...)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p align=""justify"">Face à cette réalité, nous devons réagir mais ceux qui le font seuls sont
malheureusement broyés ou ridiculisés par le pouvoir en place qui
défend ses intérêts et ceux des multinationales auxquelles il est soumis. Il est
donc important d'offrir un contrepoids à ces puissants lobbys afin de
contrecarrer leurs plans diaboliques. Lutter contre ces machines
puissantes et bien organisées ne peut se faire la fleur au fusil, il nous
faut une organisation solide qui protège ses membres et ses acteurs,
une association qui travaille à temps plein et qui puisse disposer de
moyens pour lutter contre les propagandes politiques et médiatiques.
</p>
<p align=""justify""><b>Il faut construire un front mondial de la résistance afin de
libérer le monde des maux qui sont en train de le détruire et
de mettre un terme aux massacres perpétrés aujourd’hui au
nom d’une démocratie qui présente toutes les apparences de
la dictature.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Adversaire du sionisme et des lobbys pharmaceutiques et agro-alimentaires
depuis des années au sein du Parlement belge, Laurent LOUIS a pu constater
à quel point nous étions démunis pour lutter contre ces forces qui nous
oppriment.
Seuls, sans mouvement pour nous protéger, nous sommes des cibles faciles.

					</p>
<p>Ensemble, en usant des mêmes pratiques que ces lobbys criminels, en
travaillant à temps plein pour dénoncer leurs dérives via des actions
concrètes sur le terrain, des spots publicitaires, des conférences et une
propagande efficace, nous serons en mesure de mieux informer les
citoyens et de leur ouvrir les yeux. Ce n'est que de cette manière, par la
propagande, par l'organisation, par l'information et la lutte que nous créerons
un monde meilleur et plus sain pour nos enfants !

entre tous les citoyens peu importent leur langue, leurs origines ou leur
religion en plein cœur de Bruxelles, capitale de l’Union européenne.
</b></p>
<p>Si le siège central se doit d’être en Europe, l’idéal serait de constituer des
cellules nationales dans différents pays, des cellules qui permettraient de
diffuser les actions de chaque cellule au niveau mondial (traduction de texte,
sous-titrage de vidéos, diffusion des actions, coordination, etc).
</p>
<p>Agir uniquement en Europe n’a pas de sens, il faut aussi pouvoir agir aux
Etats-Unis, en Amérique du Sud, en Russie, en Afrique, au Maghreb et au
Moyen-Orient.

<p>Le présent lobby que nous vous proposons de créer sera également le porte-

la « démoralisation » de la société mise en œuvre par la franc-maçonnerie
(IVG, mariage homosexuel, banalisation des drogues douces et dures, théorie
du genre à l’école, etc...).
</p>
<p>Une des missions prioritaires de ce lobby sera de lutter contre l’islamophobie
véhiculée par nos médias tout en dénonçant les manipulations médiatiques et
politiques. Dans une Europe manipulée et victime du terrorisme d'Etat
instrumentalisant le terrorisme prétendument islamiste pour salir les
Musulmans et favoriser la création du Grand Israël, il est primordial et urgent
de donner une image positive de l'Islam et des Musulmans en jetant des ponts
entre les différentes communautés de nos pays.

</b></p>
<p></p>
</div>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<p>Installée à titre principal à Bruxelles, en plein cœur de l’Europe mais disposant aussi
dans l’idéal d’un siège au Moyen-Orient (Beyrouth - LIBAN), en Russie (Moscou),
aux Etats-Unis, en Tunisie (Tunis), en République démocratique du Congo
(Kinshasa), en Chine (Péking) et en Amérique du sud (Vénézuela ou Bolivie), la
LIREPOC a vocation à exercer les missions suivantes :
</p>
<p>- Réaliser des critiques et analyses du monde politique européen et mondial.
</p>
<p>- Informer la population sur la mondialisation, le sionisme, la finance mondiale,
Bilderberg, Monsanto, le néo-colonialisme, les dérives totalitaires de l’Union
européenne actuelle, les crimes perpétrés par Israël, etc...
</p>
<p>- Assurer un contrepoids puissant et efficace aux manipulations médiatiques et
politiques qui pratiquent l’inversion totale des valeurs et de la réalité.
</p>
<p>- Exercer un lobbying auprès des politiciens européens, arabes et africains afin de
rassembler tous les parlementaires et élus partageant nos combats dans les
différents pays du monde.
</p>
<p>- Exercer un lobbying au sein du Parlement européen – regroupement des députés
européens partageant nos idées et valeurs. Tous les députés européens seront
contactés pour les sensibiliser à nos combats (courriers personnalisés, demande de
RDV, envoi d’une newsletter par mail, invitation à des évènements/conférences)
</p>
<p>- Rechercher le soutien de personnalités du monde sportif, musical ou artistique afin
de leur proposer de devenir les parrains de notre organisation. Parvenir à rassembler
derrière une structure solide et saine, des personnalités publiques nous aidera à
conscientiser la population aux combats que nous menons. L’idéal serait de trouver
des parrains sur les différents continents, des parrains et marraines qui disposent
d’une bonne image et qui pourraient être les ambassadeurs médiatiques de notre
structure.
</p>
<p>- Conscientiser la population par divers moyens : politique, conférence, humour,
spots publicitaires, vidéos d’information ludiques, réseaux sociaux, musique, art,
actions sur le terrain. Grâce à notre réseau, toute vidéo réalisée serait directement
traduite en anglais, en russe, en arabe, en espagnol et pourquoi pas en chinois pour
être diffusée au niveau mondial. Le constat est très clair : la parole n’est jamais
donnée, dans les médias occidentaux, aux victimes de la colonisation et du
sionisme. Autant on donne souvent la parole aux Israéliens dans nos médias, autant
on n’entend jamais le témoignage d’un Palestinien ou d’un Africain. Et quand des
vidéos de ce type sont diffusées sur le net, l’obstacle de la langue se présente
devant nous. En traduisant ces vidéos et en les diffusant à l’échelle mondiale, nous
donnerons enfin de l’écho aux souffrances des victimes de l’impérialisme américain
et sioniste ! Il est temps de libérer la parole anti-sioniste et de la diffuser partout dans
le monde !
</p>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>
</p><div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<div>
<p>- Mener des actions en vue de jeter des ponts entre les musulmans et les non-
musulmans afin de créer un véritable bien-vivre ensemble et lutter contre
l’islamophobie actuelle.
</p>
<p>- Défendre la foi et la liberté de culte dans le monde mais aussi au sein d’une Europe
dévastée par le projet franc-maçon de « démoralisation » de la société.
</p>
<p>- Lutter contre les discriminations.
</p>
<p>- Défendre la famille et le rétablissement des valeurs morales.
</p>
<p>-Lutter contre les dérives morales (mariage homosexuel, LGBT, gay pride,
avortement, euthanasie des mineurs, théorie du genre, libération totale des mœurs,
dépravation, drogues, etc...)
</p>
<p>- Développer un axe anti-américain, anti-impérialiste et anti-colonial.
</p>
<p><b>Vu le contexte, le moment est particulièrement propice pour développer un tel projet.
Les Européens ne font plus confiance aux politiciens. Un peu partout, de plus en plus
de citoyens rejettent le système et ses dérives. Les gens n’ont plus d’espoir. Il est
temps de leur rendre cet espoir ! La LIREPOC peut sans aucun doute y contribuer !
</b></p>
<p>Les Européens rejettent en outre de plus en plus le sionisme, les banques, la
mondialisation, les dérives éthiques et morales ainsi que les guerres néo-coloniales.
Nous assistons actuellement à un rejet total des élites politiques, médiatiques et
intellectuelles. Un renouveau ne demande qu’à éclore et il est de notre devoir de
participer à ce renouveau européen !

</p><div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<div>
<p align=""center""><b>Ce dont nous avons besoin
</b></p>
<p>Afin de créer ce lobby anti-sioniste et anti-impérialiste nous avons essentiellement
besoin, dans un premier temps, de moyens financiers afin de créer des bureaux et
un studio d'enregistrement en plein coeur de Bruxelles, la capitale européenne. Par
la suite, d’autres bureaux seront ouverts aux 4 coins du monde.
</p>
<p>Avec ces bureaux et ces outils audio-visuels, nous pourrons alors mener des actions
concrètes sur le terrain mais aussi sur le net. Notre résistance doit se
professionnaliser pour se faire respecter par nos ennemis et se faire mieux
entendre par nos concitoyens.
</p>
<p>L'idéal serait de pouvoir disposer d'un local qui puisse se transformer en salle de
conférence. Il n'est en effet pas normal que certaines personnes soient censurées en
Europe et ne puissent jamais trouver une salle pour s’exprimer comme c’est le cas
pour Laurent LOUIS qui a pu, ces 5 dernières années, donner des conférences à
travers le monde mais qui est interdit de toute conférence en Belgique ! Il en est de
même pour d'autres personnalités qui sont trop souvent considérées comme persona
non grata.
</p>
<p>Avec un lieu à nous, capable d'accueillir des spectateurs, nous pourrions donner la
parole à ceux que le pouvoir souhaite réduire au silence. Ce lieu pourrait également
être utilisé pour développer une activité commerciale qui puisse permettre à un
investisseur étranger d’investir dans notre lobby via une activité commerciale
annexe.
</p>
<p>Trop de citoyens se battent depuis des années sans le moindre soutien. Ces
citoyens engagés sont malheureusement trop souvent broyés par le système et
connaissent bien souvent des difficultés financières. Notre lobby sera là pour leur
venir en aide et leur permettre de continuer leur travail au sein d’une structure plus
sécurisante capable de protéger leurs intérêts et de les défendre face aux
agissements de l’Etat.
</p>
<p>Notre lobby aidera aussi tous les journalistes indépendants et les structures
d'information alternative qui existent sur le web mais qui ne disposent en général que
de très peu de moyens financiers. Ces gens qui tentent d'informer les citoyens avec
des bouts de ficelles méritent notre soutien !
</p>
<p>Grâce à notre lobby, nous ferons le nécessaire pour obtenir le soutien des pays non-
alignés qui osent encore s'opposer aux USA et à l'impérialisme sioniste afin de
pouvoir peser de plus en plus sur nos dirigeants mais aussi sur nos médias. Pour
réaliser cet axe du bien, il sera important d'organiser des voyages à l'étranger,
au Moyen-Orient, en Russie ou en Amérique du Sud afin d'y rencontrer des
responsables et des personnalités politiques pour élaborer avec elles une
politique et des actions communes.
</p>

responsables politiques. Ce n'est donc pas qu'un simple lobby que nous vous

</p>
<p align=""justify"">Ainsi, en donnant la parole aux victimes du sionisme dans le monde, nous
informerons les citoyens des crimes du sionisme et nous inciterons les
Européens à réclamer la libération de toutes les terres occupées ! Nous
n’entendons jamais un Palestinien ou un responsable du Hezbollah dans nos
médias européens qui ne donnent la parole qu’aux oppresseurs. En montrant
la réalité des enfants de Gaza, en incitant les Européens à se mobiliser pour

<p align=""justify"">Acquisition du matériel informatique et multimédia professionnel: 5000 euros.<br/>
Loyer et Garantie locative pour la location du siège à Bruxelles: en général
versement de 3 mois de loyers sur un compte bloqué au nom du bailleur. Cette
somme pourra être récupérée à la fin du bail. Au niveau du loyer, pour un simple
bureau à Bruxelles, il faut compter 1000 euros de loyer par mois. Pour louer un

</p>
<p align=""justify"">Coût mensuel du projet à Bruxelles: pour fonctionner convenablement, le présent lobby aura besoin d’un budget mensuel

Debout Les Belges proposait un programme politique novateur s’opposant aux
lobbys pharmaceutiques, à la mondialisation, à l’impérialisme, au néo-colonialisme,
au sionisme, à la franc-maçonnerie et proposant aux citoyens belges une révolution
démocratique basée sur la suppression des partis politiques et la création d’un
Parlement citoyen libéré des lobbys.
</p>
<p>En quelques semaines, se basant sur un travail parlementaire atypique le
mouvement Debout Les Belges connut un succès dépassant toutes les attentes en
atteignant les 10 000 membres, un chiffre faisant de Debout Les Belges la 4ème force
politique en Belgique francophone. Le mouvement était pourtant censuré par les
médias qui l’ignoraient totalement. Pas une interview que ce soit à la télévision, à la
radio ou même dans la presse écrite. Le mouvement dérangeait et il ne fallait surtout
pas en parler...
</p>
<p>Malgré cela, Debout Les Belges réalisa de très bons résultats aux élections de mai
2014 récoltant près de 100 000 voix en Belgique francophone. Des élections qui
furent marquées par un nombre particulièrement élevé de dysfonctionnements. Des
ordinateurs en panne, des bulletins perdus, des urnes ouvertes, des résultats
manipulés, des bulletins de vote au nom du mouvement retrouvés dans des
poubelles et un nombre particulièrement important de bulletins nuls...
</p>
<p>La meilleure performance du mouvement eut lieu dans le Hainaut où Laurent LOUIS
était candidat tête de liste au fédéral. Sa liste fit près de 25 000 voix à elle toute
seule.
</p>
<p>A titre personnel, avec un budget électoral de 3000 euros (!!!), Laurent LOUIS fit un
score exceptionnel. Avec plus de 13 000 voix de préférence, Laurent LOUIS a
obtenu le 7ème meilleur score de la province.
</p>
<p>Malheureusement, malgré ce score, Laurent LOUIS ne fut pas élu. Il y avait pourtant
18 sièges à pourvoir en Hainaut mais malgré qu’il ait obtenu le 7ème meilleur score, la
loi électorale belge ne lui permit pas de conserver son siège au Parlement.
</p>
<p>Une aberration du système belge prétendument démocratique.

<p>
</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>Obtenir un tel score sans avoir la parole dans les médias est totalement
exceptionnel. Cela démontre que Debout Les Belges et sa figure de proue sont
parvenus à toucher les citoyens et à se faire connaître malgré la censure médiatique
et l’oppression de l’Etat grâce avant tout à internet et aux réseaux sociaux.
</p>
<p>Situation totalement surréaliste dans un pays qui se veut démocratique, le
mouvement Debout Les Belges n’a jamais pu ouvrir un compte en banque auprès
d’une banque belge, rendant de la sorte impossible toute contribution financière de
ses 10 000 membres, des ressources qui lui auraient pourtant permis de mener une
campagne électorale bien plus efficace.
</p>
<p>Pour contrer un mouvement qu’il considérait comme dangereux, l’Etat avait décidé
de le priver de tout moyen financier.
</p>
<p>Malgré ces difficultés, Debout Les Belges est parvenu à rassembler de très
nombreux jeunes, souvent issus de l’immigration, de différentes confessions
religieuses mais aussi de très nombreux Belges de souche exclus du système,
défavorisés qui ne connaissaient rien à la politique et qui sont devenus des activistes
de notre cause.
</p>
<p>Malheureusement privés de moyens financiers, Debout Les Belges a du depuis
quelques mois suspendre ses activités. Trop de nos membres subissaient des
sanctions de natures diverses de la part des autorités en rapport avec leur
engagement envers notre mouvement (licenciements, perte d’un logement social,
pressions politiques et policières, etc...). Pour protéger ses membres, il a été décidé
de mettre le mouvement en veille.
<br/><br/>Pour pouvoir poursuivre son combat et développer un vrai mouvement solide, Laurent LOUIS fait désormais appel à votre aide et à votre soutien financier. Avec lui, construisez le monde de demain ! <br/></p>

Citoyenne

Depuis la seconde guerre mondiale, les européens sont colonisés par les Etats-unis
et forcés de pratiquer une politique sioniste favorable à Israël. Partout aux 4 coins du
monde, nos pays répandent le mal et font couler le sang des innocents en s'alliant
avec des pays immoraux pour lesquels l'homme n'a aucune valeur.

En Europe, la démocratie est une notion de plus en plus vague. Les dirigeants
européens ne se gênent nullement pour donner des leçons de démocratie à
l’étranger alors qu’ils sont incapables de la respecter et de la mettre en œuvre dans
leurs propres pays. Le fossé entre les citoyens et leurs représentants politique ne
cesse de s’accroître. Les citoyens attendent un changement mais le pouvoir en place
empêche toute évolution.

A cause des politiques criminelles de nos dirigeants, les attentats se
multiplient partout dans le monde. La peur se propage et la haine grandit. Si
nous ne réagissons pas, demain, ce sera le chaos !

Si nous ne parvenons pas à changer en profondeur l’Europe et sa politique, si nous
ne détournons pas les pays européens de l’axe du mal, l’axe américano-sioniste, si
nous ne dénonçons pas les alliances de nos dirigeants avec des pays voyous
comme le Qatar et l’Arabie saoudite, le chaos continuera à se propager un peu
partout dans le monde mais surtout en Afrique, au Maghreb et au Moyen-Orient.

Les manipulations médiatiques et politiques que nous connaissons actuellement font
de nous des esclaves des temps modernes.

Il est temps que le monde comprenne ce qui est en train de se jouer en ce moment.
Avec les attentats qui frappent l’Europe, la Russie et le Moyen-Orient, c'est la
stratégie du chaos qui est mise en oeuvre !

Les attentats qui frappent l’Europe et différents pays qui ont connu ces
dernières années une vague de recolonisation poursuivent un objectif simple :
la création du Grand Israël et l’établissement d’un nouvel ordre mondial !

Il faut créer la peur de l'autre au sein-même de l'Europe. Diviser pour mieux régner !

Ainsi, les attentats de Paris de 2015 (comme d'autres avant eux) sont des attentats
qui poursuivent des objectifs purement politiques. Tout comme on veut nous
présenter des chefs d’Etat étrangers comme des dictateurs ou des bouchers, nos
politiques, aidés par les médias, qui ne sont plus que des organes de propagande,
veulent nous faire croire que ce sont des musulmans radicaux qui ont perpétré ces
attentats alors que ces gens sont en fait instrumentalisés, formés et manipulés par
les services secrets européens, américains et israéliens. Le but est de créer en
Europe un sentiment d'insécurité en pointant du doigt les musulmans comme les
responsables de cette insécurité qui ne cesse de s'étendre.







N’oublions pas que nos pays européens ont aidé, armé, équipé et financé DAESH en
Syrie directement et indirectement. N’oublions pas non plus que Ben Laden et Al
Quaïda ont bénéficié largement du soutien des USA et de la CIA.

Avec ces attentats qui frappent l’Europe, tous les musulmans deviennent, pour
l'opinion publique manipulée par les médias, des terroristes potentiels. Tout est mis
en oeuvre pour vous démontrer que même votre jeune et gentille voisine de pallier
peut se transformer en kamikaze si elle est musulmane ! C'est édifiant ! C'est
extrêmement dangereux surtout que des attaques du même type au Mali ont, elles,
pour but de stigmatiser la population européenne d’origine africaine ! Désormais,
dans les transports en commun en Europe, les personnes typées africaines ou
arabes ne sont plus regardées de la même manière. La peur de l’autre se propage !

La haine du monde arabe ne cesse d'augmenter dans nos pays et tout cela
poursuit 2 objectifs concrets:

1) diviser la population de nos pays pour créer le chaos en Europe. Imaginez
les dégâts qu'une telle démarche pourrait entraîner quand on sait que 10% de la
population belge est musulmane et qu'en France cette proportion monte à 20% de la
population. C'est donc la guerre civile que ceux qui montent ces attentats et les
déguisent en attentats islamistes poursuivent et veulent créer.

2) donner des Musulmans une mauvaise image en Europe, c'est bon pour
Israël qui pourra continuer à massacrer les Palestiniens mais aussi ceux qui
oseront encore se mettre sur leur chemin. Plus l'islamophobie progresse en
Europe et plus les frontières d'Israël s'étendent ! Après avoir déjà créé de fausses
révolutions dans certains pays du Maghreb et renversé la plus grande majorité des
Chefs d’Etat hostiles au sionisme, le projet de création du Grand Israël n’a jamais été
aussi près de se réaliser. Aujourd’hui, seuls la Syrie, l’Iran et la Russie s’y opposent encore...

Il est donc primordial de s’organiser au sein-même de l’Europe mais aussi avec nos
alliés antisionistes dans le monde pour créer un front politique et citoyen de
résistance.

Il est temps que les peuples d'Europe et du monde comprennent cette triste réalité
sinon, en moins de temps qu'il ne faut pour le dire, nos pays seront plongés dans la
guerre civile et le chaos. Le chaos est en effet la seule et unique manière de revoir le
monde et son fonctionnement. Après chaque guerre mondiale, un nouvel ordre
s'établit. Le prochain, ce sera le Nouvel Ordre Mondial avec un gouvernement
mondial et sa capitale à Jérusalem, tout cela bien sûr au nom de la paix et de la lutte
contre le terrorisme. A terme, tout le pouvoir sera entre les mains d'un groupe
minuscule et ceux qui ne s'y soumettront pas seront considérés comme des
terroristes qu'il faut éliminer ! Voilà le projet en cours, voilà comment ceux qui dirigent
veulent nous soumettre à l'esclavage moderne !

Face à cette réalité, il est urgent de créer un front de la résistance regroupant
ceux qui, à travers le monde, refusent de s’allier avec l’axe du mal et
souhaitent s’opposer à l’impérialisme américain et au sionisme.









Conscient qu’en Europe la voie politique est actuellement bouchée à cause du
trucage des élections et parce que nous savons qu'aucun changement ne
viendra par le monde politique dont les personnalités ne sont mises en avant
que si elles ont vendu leur âme au diable, il est important de choisir une voie
plus souterraine qui puisse travailler sur le long terme sans se soucier des
échéances électorales.

Ce n’est donc pas un mouvement politique qu’il faut créer mais un lobby, un
groupe de pression. Les lobbys ne s'affichent pas ouvertement, ils travaillent
en sous-marin et c'est exactement ce que nous devons faire en unissant
toutes les personnalités et mouvements antisionistes dans le monde. Ce n'est
qu'ainsi que nous pourrons influer sur la société et sur les décisions de nos
élus.



Actif pendant 4 ans au Parlement belge en tant que député, Laurent LOUIS
s’est rendu compte que le lobby sioniste était plus que puissant et imposait
ses vues et ses ordres à tous les politiciens d'Europe. En outre, à côté de ce
lobby puissant, d'autres lobbys règnent en maîtres absolus en Europe. Le
lobby de l'armement mais aussi les lobbys pharmaceutiques et agro-alimentaires. Nos élus sont totalement soumis à ces lobbys qui mènent la
danse au Parlement européen et dans nos parlements nationaux.

Pour plaire à ces lobbys, tout est permis ! On crée des guerres aux 4 coins du
monde pour vendre des armes, on encourage les OGM dans notre
alimentation, on nous fait ingurgiter des produits néfastes et on nous gave de
médicaments pour mieux nous empoisonner.

N'oublions pas le projet morbide de Bill Gates qui veut réduire drastiquement
la population mondiale ! Pour ce faire, il faut des guerres, des attentats mais il
faut aussi empoisonner les citoyens et les méthodes sont nombreuses
(médicaments, chemtrails, OGM, vaccins, drogues, etc...)



Face à cette réalité, nous devons réagir mais ceux qui le font seuls sont
malheureusement broyés ou ridiculisés par le pouvoir en place qui
défend ses intérêts et ceux des multinationales auxquelles il est soumis. Il est
donc important d'offrir un contrepoids à ces puissants lobbys afin de
contrecarrer leurs plans diaboliques. Lutter contre ces machines
puissantes et bien organisées ne peut se faire la fleur au fusil, il nous
faut une organisation solide qui protège ses membres et ses acteurs,
une association qui travaille à temps plein et qui puisse disposer de
moyens pour lutter contre les propagandes politiques et médiatiques.

Il faut construire un front mondial de la résistance afin de
libérer le monde des maux qui sont en train de le détruire et
de mettre un terme aux massacres perpétrés aujourd’hui au
nom d’une démocratie qui présente toutes les apparences de
la dictature.



Adversaire du sionisme et des lobbys pharmaceutiques et agro-alimentaires
depuis des années au sein du Parlement belge, Laurent LOUIS a pu constater
à quel point nous étions démunis pour lutter contre ces forces qui nous
oppriment.
Seuls, sans mouvement pour nous protéger, nous sommes des cibles faciles.

					
Ensemble, en usant des mêmes pratiques que ces lobbys criminels, en
travaillant à temps plein pour dénoncer leurs dérives via des actions
concrètes sur le terrain, des spots publicitaires, des conférences et une
propagande efficace, nous serons en mesure de mieux informer les
citoyens et de leur ouvrir les yeux. Ce n'est que de cette manière, par la
propagande, par l'organisation, par l'information et la lutte que nous créerons
un monde meilleur et plus sain pour nos enfants !









Face à la situation mondiale qui ne cesse de se détériorer, il est
important aujourd'hui de créer un véritable lobby anti-sioniste, anti-capitaliste, anti-mondialiste prônant SANS VIOLENCE la réconciliation
entre tous les citoyens peu importent leur langue, leurs origines ou leur
religion en plein cœur de Bruxelles, capitale de l’Union européenne.

Si le siège central se doit d’être en Europe, l’idéal serait de constituer des
cellules nationales dans différents pays, des cellules qui permettraient de
diffuser les actions de chaque cellule au niveau mondial (traduction de texte,
sous-titrage de vidéos, diffusion des actions, coordination, etc).

Agir uniquement en Europe n’a pas de sens, il faut aussi pouvoir agir aux
Etats-Unis, en Amérique du Sud, en Russie, en Afrique, au Maghreb et au
Moyen-Orient.

Le présent lobby que nous vous proposons de créer sera également le porte-
parole des valeurs morales que nos sociétés actuelles ont reniées à cause de
la « démoralisation » de la société mise en œuvre par la franc-maçonnerie
(IVG, mariage homosexuel, banalisation des drogues douces et dures, théorie
du genre à l’école, etc...).

Une des missions prioritaires de ce lobby sera de lutter contre l’islamophobie
véhiculée par nos médias tout en dénonçant les manipulations médiatiques et
politiques. Dans une Europe manipulée et victime du terrorisme d'Etat
instrumentalisant le terrorisme prétendument islamiste pour salir les
Musulmans et favoriser la création du Grand Israël, il est primordial et urgent
de donner une image positive de l'Islam et des Musulmans en jetant des ponts
entre les différentes communautés de nos pays.

Face à l'axe du mal, nous devons créer et organiser l'axe du bien ! La
LIREPOC, la Ligue de Résistance Politique et Citoyenne se propose de mener
ce combat ! 









Les Missions de la LIREPOC






Installée à titre principal à Bruxelles, en plein cœur de l’Europe mais disposant aussi
dans l’idéal d’un siège au Moyen-Orient (Beyrouth - LIBAN), en Russie (Moscou),
aux Etats-Unis, en Tunisie (Tunis), en République démocratique du Congo
(Kinshasa), en Chine (Péking) et en Amérique du sud (Vénézuela ou Bolivie), la
LIREPOC a vocation à exercer les missions suivantes :

- Réaliser des critiques et analyses du monde politique européen et mondial.

- Informer la population sur la mondialisation, le sionisme, la finance mondiale,
Bilderberg, Monsanto, le néo-colonialisme, les dérives totalitaires de l’Union
européenne actuelle, les crimes perpétrés par Israël, etc...

- Assurer un contrepoids puissant et efficace aux manipulations médiatiques et
politiques qui pratiquent l’inversion totale des valeurs et de la réalité.

- Exercer un lobbying auprès des politiciens européens, arabes et africains afin de
rassembler tous les parlementaires et élus partageant nos combats dans les
différents pays du monde.

- Exercer un lobbying au sein du Parlement européen – regroupement des députés
européens partageant nos idées et valeurs. Tous les députés européens seront
contactés pour les sensibiliser à nos combats (courriers personnalisés, demande de
RDV, envoi d’une newsletter par mail, invitation à des évènements/conférences)

- Rechercher le soutien de personnalités du monde sportif, musical ou artistique afin
de leur proposer de devenir les parrains de notre organisation. Parvenir à rassembler
derrière une structure solide et saine, des personnalités publiques nous aidera à
conscientiser la population aux combats que nous menons. L’idéal serait de trouver
des parrains sur les différents continents, des parrains et marraines qui disposent
d’une bonne image et qui pourraient être les ambassadeurs médiatiques de notre
structure.

- Conscientiser la population par divers moyens : politique, conférence, humour,
spots publicitaires, vidéos d’information ludiques, réseaux sociaux, musique, art,
actions sur le terrain. Grâce à notre réseau, toute vidéo réalisée serait directement
traduite en anglais, en russe, en arabe, en espagnol et pourquoi pas en chinois pour
être diffusée au niveau mondial. Le constat est très clair : la parole n’est jamais
donnée, dans les médias occidentaux, aux victimes de la colonisation et du
sionisme. Autant on donne souvent la parole aux Israéliens dans nos médias, autant
on n’entend jamais le témoignage d’un Palestinien ou d’un Africain. Et quand des
vidéos de ce type sont diffusées sur le net, l’obstacle de la langue se présente
devant nous. En traduisant ces vidéos et en les diffusant à l’échelle mondiale, nous
donnerons enfin de l’écho aux souffrances des victimes de l’impérialisme américain
et sioniste ! Il est temps de libérer la parole anti-sioniste et de la diffuser partout dans
le monde !







- Mener des actions en vue de jeter des ponts entre les musulmans et les non-
musulmans afin de créer un véritable bien-vivre ensemble et lutter contre
l’islamophobie actuelle.

- Défendre la foi et la liberté de culte dans le monde mais aussi au sein d’une Europe
dévastée par le projet franc-maçon de « démoralisation » de la société.

- Lutter contre les discriminations.

- Défendre la famille et le rétablissement des valeurs morales.

-Lutter contre les dérives morales (mariage homosexuel, LGBT, gay pride,
avortement, euthanasie des mineurs, théorie du genre, libération totale des mœurs,
dépravation, drogues, etc...)

- Développer un axe anti-américain, anti-impérialiste et anti-colonial.

Vu le contexte, le moment est particulièrement propice pour développer un tel projet.
Les Européens ne font plus confiance aux politiciens. Un peu partout, de plus en plus
de citoyens rejettent le système et ses dérives. Les gens n’ont plus d’espoir. Il est
temps de leur rendre cet espoir ! La LIREPOC peut sans aucun doute y contribuer !

Les Européens rejettent en outre de plus en plus le sionisme, les banques, la
mondialisation, les dérives éthiques et morales ainsi que les guerres néo-coloniales.
Nous assistons actuellement à un rejet total des élites politiques, médiatiques et
intellectuelles. Un renouveau ne demande qu’à éclore et il est de notre devoir de
participer à ce renouveau européen !







Ce dont nous avons besoin

Afin de créer ce lobby anti-sioniste et anti-impérialiste nous avons essentiellement
besoin, dans un premier temps, de moyens financiers afin de créer des bureaux et
un studio d'enregistrement en plein coeur de Bruxelles, la capitale européenne. Par
la suite, d’autres bureaux seront ouverts aux 4 coins du monde.

Avec ces bureaux et ces outils audio-visuels, nous pourrons alors mener des actions
concrètes sur le terrain mais aussi sur le net. Notre résistance doit se
professionnaliser pour se faire respecter par nos ennemis et se faire mieux
entendre par nos concitoyens.

L'idéal serait de pouvoir disposer d'un local qui puisse se transformer en salle de
conférence. Il n'est en effet pas normal que certaines personnes soient censurées en
Europe et ne puissent jamais trouver une salle pour s’exprimer comme c’est le cas
pour Laurent LOUIS qui a pu, ces 5 dernières années, donner des conférences à
travers le monde mais qui est interdit de toute conférence en Belgique ! Il en est de
même pour d'autres personnalités qui sont trop souvent considérées comme persona
non grata.

Avec un lieu à nous, capable d'accueillir des spectateurs, nous pourrions donner la
parole à ceux que le pouvoir souhaite réduire au silence. Ce lieu pourrait également
être utilisé pour développer une activité commerciale qui puisse permettre à un
investisseur étranger d’investir dans notre lobby via une activité commerciale
annexe.

Trop de citoyens se battent depuis des années sans le moindre soutien. Ces
citoyens engagés sont malheureusement trop souvent broyés par le système et
connaissent bien souvent des difficultés financières. Notre lobby sera là pour leur
venir en aide et leur permettre de continuer leur travail au sein d’une structure plus
sécurisante capable de protéger leurs intérêts et de les défendre face aux
agissements de l’Etat.

Notre lobby aidera aussi tous les journalistes indépendants et les structures
d'information alternative qui existent sur le web mais qui ne disposent en général que
de très peu de moyens financiers. Ces gens qui tentent d'informer les citoyens avec
des bouts de ficelles méritent notre soutien !

Grâce à notre lobby, nous ferons le nécessaire pour obtenir le soutien des pays non-
alignés qui osent encore s'opposer aux USA et à l'impérialisme sioniste afin de
pouvoir peser de plus en plus sur nos dirigeants mais aussi sur nos médias. Pour
réaliser cet axe du bien, il sera important d'organiser des voyages à l'étranger,
au Moyen-Orient, en Russie ou en Amérique du Sud afin d'y rencontrer des
responsables et des personnalités politiques pour élaborer avec elles une
politique et des actions communes.

Il est temps de mettre sur pied une diplomatie parallèle à celle menée par nos
responsables politiques. Ce n'est donc pas qu'un simple lobby que nous vous







proposons de créer mais bien une alternative solide et réfléchie à la société
dans laquelle nous vivons ! Vous seuls pouvez nous aider à construire ce projet et à lutter contre le mal !





Vous qui savez la réalité du monde dans lequel nous vivons pouvez aider à la
libération de l'Europe et de la Palestine en finançant ce lobby qui informera la
population européenne sur les crimes du sionisme, les manipulations
médiatiques et politiques et les dérives de l'Etat d'Israël.

Ainsi, en donnant la parole aux victimes du sionisme dans le monde, nous
informerons les citoyens des crimes du sionisme et nous inciterons les
Européens à réclamer la libération de toutes les terres occupées ! Nous
n’entendons jamais un Palestinien ou un responsable du Hezbollah dans nos
médias européens qui ne donnent la parole qu’aux oppresseurs. En montrant
la réalité des enfants de Gaza, en incitant les Européens à se mobiliser pour
la justice et la paix en Palestine, nous pourrons combattre l’axe sioniste.



Parce que vous avez conscience des manipulations médiatiques, vous seuls
pouvez nous aider à mettre fin aux guerres du mensonge menées par nos
pays aux 4 coins du monde et qui tuent des milliers de civils innocents au nom
du terrorisme sioniste, du dieu dollar ou d'intérêts économiques et géo-
politiques

Coût de lancement du projet pour Bruxelles

Acquisition du matériel informatique et multimédia professionnel: 5000 euros.
Loyer et Garantie locative pour la location du siège à Bruxelles: en général
versement de 3 mois de loyers sur un compte bloqué au nom du bailleur. Cette
somme pourra être récupérée à la fin du bail. Au niveau du loyer, pour un simple
bureau à Bruxelles, il faut compter 1000 euros de loyer par mois. Pour louer un
bâtiment style « ambassade » il faut compter entre 2000 à 3500 euros par mois.

Coût mensuel du projet à Bruxelles: pour fonctionner convenablement, le présent lobby aura besoin d’un budget mensuel
variant entre minimum 3000 euros et idéalement 7500 euros pour couvrir les charges
locatives du siège, l’organisation d’évènements, la réalisation de projets concrets, la
réalisation de vidéos de propagande, la présence quotidienne sur les réseaux
sociaux et la rémunération de ses collaborateurs. Bien entendu, plus nous
disposerons de moyens financiers et plus nous pourrons multiplier nos collaborateurs
et nos actions.

						





	
 




A vous de jouer, vous savez l'homme que je suis, vous savez les valeurs qui sont les miennes, vous m'avez vu affronter les élus de mon pays seul contre tous, vous m'avez vu défendre des valeurs nobles face à des politiciens immoraux, vous m'avez vu sacrifier mes intérêts personnels pour défendre le bien commun, vous m'avez vu m'opposer de plein fouet à Israël en dénonçant ses crimes, vous m'avez vu aux côtés des victimes du sionisme et des manipulations médiatiques, je vous demande juste de m'aider par votre contribution financière pour créer le monde de demain ! 

 Tous les dons sont les bienvenus et seront utiles. Partagez au maximum ce projet auprès de vos amis et de vos connaissances. Vous pouvez tous être les acteurs du changement ! 
PS: Avec 3000 à 5000 euros par mois, nous pourrons développer un vrai lobby qui fonctionnera à temps plein et qui mènera des actions concrètes sur le terrain et sur le net. 5000 euros par mois, c'est peu et c'est beaucoup à la fois mais sincèrement, je crois que le projet en vaut la peine. Bien entendu, plus nous récolterons et plus nous pourrons améliorer notre fonctionnement. N'attendons plus une aide extérieure, investissons-nous et donnons-nous les moyens de libérer nos pays des maux qui l'oppriment ! L'heure de la révolte a sonné ! Organisons-nous pour assurer notre victoire !

PS: Pour ceux qui ne le connaitraient pas, voici qui est Laurent LOUIS:
Elu au Parlement fédéral belge en juin 2010, Laurent LOUIS a fait trembler la
politique belge durant son mandat. Grâce à ses interventions dérangeantes et à
contre courant de la politique gouvernementale belge et européenne, Laurent LOUIS
est parvenu à rassembler derrière lui une frange importante de la population belge
tout en bénéficiant d’un capital sympathie en France mais aussi dans différents pays
du monde, en Afrique et au Moyen-Orient. 
Jamais jusqu’ici un député belge n’était
parvenu à faire autant parler de lui à l’étranger, signe que le poids des mots et des
images est considérable dans le monde actuel.

					


Pour concrétiser ce soutien, le mouvement Debout Les Belges fut créé en novembre
2013 en vue des élections fédérales, régionales et européennes de mai 2014.
Debout Les Belges proposait un programme politique novateur s’opposant aux
lobbys pharmaceutiques, à la mondialisation, à l’impérialisme, au néo-colonialisme,
au sionisme, à la franc-maçonnerie et proposant aux citoyens belges une révolution
démocratique basée sur la suppression des partis politiques et la création d’un
Parlement citoyen libéré des lobbys.

En quelques semaines, se basant sur un travail parlementaire atypique le
mouvement Debout Les Belges connut un succès dépassant toutes les attentes en
atteignant les 10 000 membres, un chiffre faisant de Debout Les Belges la 4ème force
politique en Belgique francophone. Le mouvement était pourtant censuré par les
médias qui l’ignoraient totalement. Pas une interview que ce soit à la télévision, à la
radio ou même dans la presse écrite. Le mouvement dérangeait et il ne fallait surtout
pas en parler...

Malgré cela, Debout Les Belges réalisa de très bons résultats aux élections de mai
2014 récoltant près de 100 000 voix en Belgique francophone. Des élections qui
furent marquées par un nombre particulièrement élevé de dysfonctionnements. Des
ordinateurs en panne, des bulletins perdus, des urnes ouvertes, des résultats
manipulés, des bulletins de vote au nom du mouvement retrouvés dans des
poubelles et un nombre particulièrement important de bulletins nuls...

La meilleure performance du mouvement eut lieu dans le Hainaut où Laurent LOUIS
était candidat tête de liste au fédéral. Sa liste fit près de 25 000 voix à elle toute
seule.

A titre personnel, avec un budget électoral de 3000 euros (!!!), Laurent LOUIS fit un
score exceptionnel. Avec plus de 13 000 voix de préférence, Laurent LOUIS a
obtenu le 7ème meilleur score de la province.

Malheureusement, malgré ce score, Laurent LOUIS ne fut pas élu. Il y avait pourtant
18 sièges à pourvoir en Hainaut mais malgré qu’il ait obtenu le 7ème meilleur score, la
loi électorale belge ne lui permit pas de conserver son siège au Parlement.

Une aberration du système belge prétendument démocratique.






Obtenir un tel score sans avoir la parole dans les médias est totalement
exceptionnel. Cela démontre que Debout Les Belges et sa figure de proue sont
parvenus à toucher les citoyens et à se faire connaître malgré la censure médiatique
et l’oppression de l’Etat grâce avant tout à internet et aux réseaux sociaux.

Situation totalement surréaliste dans un pays qui se veut démocratique, le
mouvement Debout Les Belges n’a jamais pu ouvrir un compte en banque auprès
d’une banque belge, rendant de la sorte impossible toute contribution financière de
ses 10 000 membres, des ressources qui lui auraient pourtant permis de mener une
campagne électorale bien plus efficace.

Pour contrer un mouvement qu’il considérait comme dangereux, l’Etat avait décidé
de le priver de tout moyen financier.

Malgré ces difficultés, Debout Les Belges est parvenu à rassembler de très
nombreux jeunes, souvent issus de l’immigration, de différentes confessions
religieuses mais aussi de très nombreux Belges de souche exclus du système,
défavorisés qui ne connaissaient rien à la politique et qui sont devenus des activistes
de notre cause.

Malheureusement privés de moyens financiers, Debout Les Belges a du depuis
quelques mois suspendre ses activités. Trop de nos membres subissaient des
sanctions de natures diverses de la part des autorités en rapport avec leur
engagement envers notre mouvement (licenciements, perte d’un logement social,
pressions politiques et policières, etc...). Pour protéger ses membres, il a été décidé
de mettre le mouvement en veille.
Pour pouvoir poursuivre son combat et développer un vrai mouvement solide, Laurent LOUIS fait désormais appel à votre aide et à votre soutien financier. Avec lui, construisez le monde de demain !",2.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Joyce Ng’s <i>9/11 Hotel Survivors</i>: An Oral History eternally preserves a monumental tragedy in American history through the voices of the people who were in the 9/11 Hotel that day.  </p>
<p>The stories that Joyce Ng has compiled comes from a diverse group of individuals: people who managed to escape from the famous 24-story hotel that was destroyed on 9/11.  The book contains oral histories of harrowing escapes from firefighters, economists, lawyers, hotel guests, employees, business travelers,  individuals from other countries.   One
of the stories of survival include the author, Joyce Ng, who was a recent
college graduate traveling on a business trip to the World Trade Center
and narrowly escaped death.  The book also speaks to the heroes who risked
their lives to help others, and the bereaved of 9/11.</p>
<p><b>These are individuals whose lives will be forever impacted by the horror and chaos they witnessed.</b></p>
<p><i>Joyce Ng’s </i>moving oral history chronicles the stories of a group of people who miraculously made it to safety: It covers survivors who were caught in the rubble, to the priest who narrowly escaped while in the gym on the 24th floor, to the heroes who risked their lives to rescue a disabled woman in a wheelchair, to business travelers, to firefighters who risked their lives to save others. There are many amazing stories, including the journey post-9/11 of uniting with other survivors.</p>

<h2>About the Author</h2>
<p>The author, Joyce Ng was traveling to New York on one of her first consulting assignments.  She was a recent college graduate and as a young adult, witnessed a major event that forever changed her life.  On 9/11, when the first plane crashed into the North Tower, she was trapped on the 13th floor of the hotel. The plane's landing gear fell onto the roof of the hotel, and the building caught on fire.  While the hotel was burning, debris was falling around the area and she witnessed people getting killed or injured.   Joyce, and many others, had to flee the burning building.   For Joyce, witnessing a devastation at young age left a devastating impact.   There is not a day that goes by that she doesn't think about 9/11.</p>
<p>On a mission to help others, she has founded a non-profit to unite 9/11 survivors from the hotel and bring awareness to the trauma and plight from everyone who witnessed terrorist attacks. </p>

</div></div>","Haunting stories of loss, hope, courage and heroism.

Joyce Ng’s 9/11 Hotel Survivors: An Oral History eternally preserves a monumental tragedy in American history through the voices of the people who were in the 9/11 Hotel that day.  
The stories that Joyce Ng has compiled comes from a diverse group of individuals: people who managed to escape from the famous 24-story hotel that was destroyed on 9/11.  The book contains oral histories of harrowing escapes from firefighters, economists, lawyers, hotel guests, employees, business travelers,  individuals from other countries.   One
of the stories of survival include the author, Joyce Ng, who was a recent
college graduate traveling on a business trip to the World Trade Center
and narrowly escaped death.  The book also speaks to the heroes who risked
their lives to help others, and the bereaved of 9/11.
These are individuals whose lives will be forever impacted by the horror and chaos they witnessed.
Joyce Ng’s moving oral history chronicles the stories of a group of people who miraculously made it to safety: It covers survivors who were caught in the rubble, to the priest who narrowly escaped while in the gym on the 24th floor, to the heroes who risked their lives to rescue a disabled woman in a wheelchair, to business travelers, to firefighters who risked their lives to save others. There are many amazing stories, including the journey post-9/11 of uniting with other survivors.
  The faces of 9/11 hotel survivors 
  These are the faces of the survivors and the bereaved  





Stories of miraculous escapes 
Joyce worked with the History channel on a documentary focused on the hotel, and the video can be found in the clip above. 


                           


9/11 Survivors: Joyce Ng and Dick Stark at the new 9/11 National Museum (2014)   
 There are amazing stories of escape and triumph in the book
Dick was 80 years old and in the hotel when the building collapsed on him. Trapped in the rubble and dust, Dick could not breathe. At 80 years old,  he thought he would perish in the hotel amidst the dust and rubble.  Miraculously, Dick was saved by a firefighter, who guided Dick to leave.  He made Dick cross the steel beam and lead him out to safety.  Although Dick was hospitalized, he lived for nearly 14 more years after 9/11 due to the bravery of the firefighter. His story is an amazing tribute to survival.  
With 50 years difference between the two survivors, it showed that 9/11 impacted people of all ages, and diverse backgrounds, but it also brought people together. 

 9/11 National Museum and BOOK For 9/11 survivors, it is important to have the survivors and the building we escaped from be represented as part of  the historical telling of 9/11.   Having history be told through personal artifacts, photographs and first-person testimonial is an essential and powerful way  to remember 9/11. With museum artifacts and a book, it will help tell the full historical stories for future generations.

sociales (LOVE).</p>

a pagar a los servicios de desarrollo, tecnología, diseño y comunicación.</p>
<p>A través de las recompensas puedes ser FUNDADOR de POSITIV y
obtener muchas ventajas como usuario. Si nos ayudas ahora serás recordado para

<p>Si no obtenemos los fondos necesarios para empezar el
desarrollo, devolveremos los fondos a los usuarios que hayan patrocinado. Si
hubiese un sobrante, lo usaremos para continuar con las labores de búsqueda de
financiación a través de otras estrategias. Cualquier ayuda que obtengamos nos

positivo ;-)</p>

Respecto a la aceptación, hemos diseñado una red social muy atractiva que
gustará desde el primer momento y con un gran elemento diferenciador: que la

</div></div>","Demon possession has swept through Glace's neighboring kingdom, turning humans into hellhounds. These great, fanged wolves are wild, desperate, and hungry. Only the sworn Hunters have kept them back for five long, bloody years. At the young age of fifteen, Belle LeClair became a Hunter. She no longer remembers how many hounds she's killed, or how many friends she's buried. Still, Belle leads the hunt till a tragedy forces her deep into the dark kingdom. Her heart will be turned, her loyalty tested— and fate will intervene. 

Amid a backdrop of Steampunk inventions and a harsh winter landscape, The Beast is a re-imagining of the infamous love between a beauty and a beast.


Sample The Beast (Book 1)
Chapters 1-2: Pay with a share!


*Caution: Book One Spoilers* 
In book two we get to move beyond the fairy tale.  Now that Castle Vakre Fjell has ""re-entered the world"", several things remain uncertain. What is to be done about the roaming hellhounds? The norn, Skuld, is dead but does that mean the wolf-god Fenrir is finished as well? For Belle, she wonders how long her relationship with Aleksander can last when she isn't noble born? 
In The Beauty, surprises abound and life quickly goes from simple to a whirlwind. Look forward to new steampunk inventions, new characters, and exciting new travels.

<p>$5000 that I want to raise through this campaign is much lower that the

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Today, I am writing as an unwilling
participant, an observer and an actor in a play of the unknown, with the
purpose of letting the angels fall, revealing the hidden demons and warning the
curious who, willingly or unwillingly, want to open the door that leads to
darkness. </p>
<p>The stories I am about to recount are works of
fiction, but their foundation lies in truth: real events and real people. In
them you might find a character that resembles someone you know or someone like
you from another time or place. As entertaining as the stories might be, they
are about someone who at one time dared to open a door … to the Forbidden Realm.</p>
Hi,
I’m Eddy Mora. I am a writer and an artist. I have written a collection of
supernatural stories and a full thriller-romantic novel. Now, I need a
professional editor to help me bring them to light, and for this, I need your
help. I would love to publish and share my art with the world. Would you
consider helping me by becoming my patron or advocate?</div><div>
<p>I gave Dave, a friend of mine, a copy
of my manuscript to read, to possibly help me with editing. He gave it back
with a note that read: “The stories are quite good. Except that now I have to
sleep with the lights on.” He doesn't know it yet, but he coined the subtitle
for my short story book as he helped me with the initial editing. </p>
<p>How did I come up with these stories? Some
I experienced personally, and some I heard through my mom or other sources. Growing
up, <i>I</i> had to sleep with the lights
on, due to the stories she used to tell us before we went to bed and or the
tales my relatives told around family gatherings. I have changed the stories a
bit, both to protect the innocent and to make them more entertaining—but
believe me, they are based on real events. It will be up to you to decide what
is real and what is not, which ones I have lived or not.</p>
<p>Sounds interesting?</p> </div> <div> <h3>
<b>What
I Need and What You Get</b>
</h3> <p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>It has taken me 25 years to be able to
finally sit down and write confidently in a language other than my own; family
and work came first. Now, my first two manuscripts are finished, all the
writing is done. I need your help in publishing both books.</p>
<p>I was trained as a graphic designer and a fine art painter and I have been an artist since childhood. My passion is creating, be it a wooden sculpture, a painting, or a written page—it is all art to me. I have been writing since I was a kid, but in Spanish, not English. Ever since coming to this country and learning the language, I’ve been yearning to put my ideas down for others to read. Now is the time. I want to share this passion with the world, and I need your help to make it happen.<br/></p>
<p>“The Forbidden Realm” is a collection
of supernatural horror stories drawn from personal experiences. <b><i>Die to Live</i></b> is a thriller/romance novel about a girl’s
survival in the face of danger. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The novel tells the story of a girl who, after witnessing a crime, has to change her identity to try to escape the people who want to kill her</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">.</span></p>
<p>With both books done and ready for
publishing, any proceeds from this campaign will go toward paying a
professional editor and Amazon’s initial publishing and marketing fees. </p>

I plan to publish both
books through Amazon as a self-publisher. Being a graphic designer myself, I
will design and create the book format, cover, and any marketing art needed. So
all the proceeds will go to editing and the marketing fees Amazon requires,
such as an ISBN number, promotion, and the materials for producing the “perks”
for contributor/backer rewards.</div><div>Stories Outline</div><div>
<b>The Seer</b><span><br/></span>
</div><div>A woman seeks the help of a seer not knowing she brings home more than she bargained.</div><div><b>Sleepwalker</b></div><div>A woman sleepwalks after being healed of a cancer by a famous doctor dead already over 100 years earlier.</div><div><b>The Kiss</b></div><div>An 16th century legend comes alive after a boy desecrates the resting place of a beautiful girl.</div><div><b>The Visitor</b></div><div>A stranger knocks on the door and becomes instrument in releasing the hidden demons at the dinner party.</div><div><b>Angel</b></div><div>A man betrays his marriage vows at a great price after asking the universe for a chance for change.</div><div><b>The Beast</b></div><div>Obsessed with thinking something or someone is following, a man faces evil after calling the forces from hell.</div><div><b>The Witch of Calle Fallas</b></div><div>A man jumps at the  opportunity of life change when he meets a young girl at a bus not knowing that she is about to change him forever.</div><div><b>The river girl</b></div><div>A boy follows at night what he claims is the love of his life only to find a door to the forbidden realm<br/>

Today, I am writing as an unwilling
participant, an observer and an actor in a play of the unknown, with the
purpose of letting the angels fall, revealing the hidden demons and warning the
curious who, willingly or unwillingly, want to open the door that leads to
darkness. 
The stories I am about to recount are works of
fiction, but their foundation lies in truth: real events and real people. In
them you might find a character that resembles someone you know or someone like
you from another time or place. As entertaining as the stories might be, they
are about someone who at one time dared to open a door … to the Forbidden Realm.
Hi,
I’m Eddy Mora. I am a writer and an artist. I have written a collection of
supernatural stories and a full thriller-romantic novel. Now, I need a
professional editor to help me bring them to light, and for this, I need your
help. I would love to publish and share my art with the world. Would you
consider helping me by becoming my patron or advocate?
I gave Dave, a friend of mine, a copy
of my manuscript to read, to possibly help me with editing. He gave it back
with a note that read: “The stories are quite good. Except that now I have to
sleep with the lights on.” He doesn't know it yet, but he coined the subtitle
for my short story book as he helped me with the initial editing. 
How did I come up with these stories? Some
I experienced personally, and some I heard through my mom or other sources. Growing
up, I had to sleep with the lights
on, due to the stories she used to tell us before we went to bed and or the
tales my relatives told around family gatherings. I have changed the stories a
bit, both to protect the innocent and to make them more entertaining—but
believe me, they are based on real events. It will be up to you to decide what
is real and what is not, which ones I have lived or not.
Sounds interesting?   
What
I Need and What You Get
 


It has taken me 25 years to be able to
finally sit down and write confidently in a language other than my own; family
and work came first. Now, my first two manuscripts are finished, all the
writing is done. I need your help in publishing both books.
I was trained as a graphic designer and a fine art painter and I have been an artist since childhood. My passion is creating, be it a wooden sculpture, a painting, or a written page—it is all art to me. I have been writing since I was a kid, but in Spanish, not English. Ever since coming to this country and learning the language, I’ve been yearning to put my ideas down for others to read. Now is the time. I want to share this passion with the world, and I need your help to make it happen.
“The Forbidden Realm” is a collection
of supernatural horror stories drawn from personal experiences. Die to Live is a thriller/romance novel about a girl’s
survival in the face of danger. The novel tells the story of a girl who, after witnessing a crime, has to change her identity to try to escape the people who want to kill her.
With both books done and ready for
publishing, any proceeds from this campaign will go toward paying a
professional editor and Amazon’s initial publishing and marketing fees. 

I plan to publish both
books through Amazon as a self-publisher. Being a graphic designer myself, I
will design and create the book format, cover, and any marketing art needed. So
all the proceeds will go to editing and the marketing fees Amazon requires,
such as an ISBN number, promotion, and the materials for producing the “perks”
for contributor/backer rewards.Stories Outline
The Seer
A woman seeks the help of a seer not knowing she brings home more than she bargained.SleepwalkerA woman sleepwalks after being healed of a cancer by a famous doctor dead already over 100 years earlier.The KissAn 16th century legend comes alive after a boy desecrates the resting place of a beautiful girl.The VisitorA stranger knocks on the door and becomes instrument in releasing the hidden demons at the dinner party.AngelA man betrays his marriage vows at a great price after asking the universe for a chance for change.The BeastObsessed with thinking something or someone is following, a man faces evil after calling the forces from hell.The Witch of Calle FallasA man jumps at the  opportunity of life change when he meets a young girl at a bus not knowing that she is about to change him forever.The river girlA boy follows at night what he claims is the love of his life only to find a door to the forbidden realm 

These
are a few of the things I need and where the money from funding will go:



Fund professional copy editing by
     Fran Fahey (an awesome editor) of my most ambitious writing project to
     date, “Die to Live.”
A full, professional copy editing by
     editor Fran Fahey of “The Forbidden Realm” book.
Create a website for both books.
Pay ISBN and Amazon book and
     promotion fees toward the publication of both books.
Perks materials and supplies.
Printing and shipping of
     perks/backer rewards.
Book promotion through
Amazon to libraries and booksellers

<p><strong>Who We Are</strong></p>
<p>Word Branch Publishing is comprised of authors, editors, and one very talented artist.  We have an abundance of skills that include more than just writing, and each person has much to contribute to the cooperative to insure its success.</p>
<p>The owner and founder, Catherine Rayburn-Trobaugh, has nearly a decade in the publishing business including working in marketing for a major publisher.  In addition, she has a master’s degree in English and writing, 20 years experience teaching writing at the college level, and has written and published five of her own books. In WBP’s five years, she has created a system of publishing that is both efficient and effective, and this experience will prove to be invaluable as the co-op grows.</p>
<p>We are passionate about this innovative idea, and we hope you are too.  Please feel free to get to know our authors and staff at our website and email us with your questions and comments: <a href=""http://wordbranch.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://wordbranch.com</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>Currently, Word Branch Publishing is a privately owned company, but the goal is to convert it to a not-for-profit, author-run cooperative.  We’ll need funding for both legal fees and a minimum of six months operating costs in addition to fundraising costs and unforeseen circumstances. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473636881/gb2eqyylsnrjrzjnzjdl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>You can keep up with the transformation at <a href=""http://www.wordbranch.com/wbp-changes.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.wordbranch.com/wbp-changes.html</a>. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We want to show our gratitude for your gift by sharing with you some of the wares and services of our talented family of writers, editors, and our illustrator.  We are offering everything from original art, signed book copies to Skyping sessions, editing services and more.  Check out all the goodies we are giving away on the right side of the page.  You can also find out details at <a href=""http://www.wordbranch.com/donation-perks.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.wordbranch.com/donation-perks.html</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our Impact</strong></p>
<p>Currently authors have only three options for publishing: Traditional, self-publishing, and vanity publishing (pay to publish). </p>
<ul>
<li>Traditional publishing is extremely difficult to break into, and the industry tends to treat unproven authors badly. </li>
<li>While some vanity presses are legitimate platforms for publishing, others border on predatory, and they can be very expensive with little personal attention.</li>
<li>Self-publishing has been an option for many, but the publishing industry is complex, and it is difficult for an individual to maneuver the procedures.  In addition, most bookstores won’t buy directly from self-published authors.</li>
</ul>
<p>What the Word Branch Publishing Cooperative will do is fill the gaps and give authors back their power in the publishing and book selling community. Our goal is to pool the talents and interests of our team to create a community of teamwork, creativity, and success. We have a three-pronged plan to accomplish our goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>Utilize our current talent and published books to maintain the integrity of WBP and aid in the conversion of a private company to a not-for-profit cooperative.</li>
<li>Recruit new authors and support to develop a solid foundation for growth.</li>
<li>Maintain a high quality of book publishing that offers a haven for talented authors.</li>
</ol>
<p style=""margin-left:38.25pt;""> </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>We are confident that we have built a solid background to convert WBP into a successful cooperative; however, we also realize that unexpected challenges may arise. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>We don’t meet our fundraising goal: </strong>While we feel that we have set a reasonable and achievable goal, in the event that we don’t reach it, there is a contingency plan.           <ul>
<li>If we reach an amount suitable for legal fees, we will continue with our plan but at a slower rate to gain the extra operating funds.</li>
<li>If we are not able to cover legal costs, we will use the remaining donations to create a one-time scholarship for a promising writer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>

</div></div>","Who We Are
Word Branch Publishing is comprised of authors, editors, and one very talented artist.  We have an abundance of skills that include more than just writing, and each person has much to contribute to the cooperative to insure its success.
The owner and founder, Catherine Rayburn-Trobaugh, has nearly a decade in the publishing business including working in marketing for a major publisher.  In addition, she has a master’s degree in English and writing, 20 years experience teaching writing at the college level, and has written and published five of her own books. In WBP’s five years, she has created a system of publishing that is both efficient and effective, and this experience will prove to be invaluable as the co-op grows.
We are passionate about this innovative idea, and we hope you are too.  Please feel free to get to know our authors and staff at our website and email us with your questions and comments: http://wordbranch.com
 
What We Need
Currently, Word Branch Publishing is a privately owned company, but the goal is to convert it to a not-for-profit, author-run cooperative.  We’ll need funding for both legal fees and a minimum of six months operating costs in addition to fundraising costs and unforeseen circumstances. 
 

You can keep up with the transformation at http://www.wordbranch.com/wbp-changes.html. 
 
What You Get
We want to show our gratitude for your gift by sharing with you some of the wares and services of our talented family of writers, editors, and our illustrator.  We are offering everything from original art, signed book copies to Skyping sessions, editing services and more.  Check out all the goodies we are giving away on the right side of the page.  You can also find out details at http://www.wordbranch.com/donation-perks.html
 
Our Impact
Currently authors have only three options for publishing: Traditional, self-publishing, and vanity publishing (pay to publish). 

Traditional publishing is extremely difficult to break into, and the industry tends to treat unproven authors badly. 
While some vanity presses are legitimate platforms for publishing, others border on predatory, and they can be very expensive with little personal attention.
Self-publishing has been an option for many, but the publishing industry is complex, and it is difficult for an individual to maneuver the procedures.  In addition, most bookstores won’t buy directly from self-published authors.

What the Word Branch Publishing Cooperative will do is fill the gaps and give authors back their power in the publishing and book selling community. Our goal is to pool the talents and interests of our team to create a community of teamwork, creativity, and success. We have a three-pronged plan to accomplish our goals:

Utilize our current talent and published books to maintain the integrity of WBP and aid in the conversion of a private company to a not-for-profit cooperative.
Recruit new authors and support to develop a solid foundation for growth.
Maintain a high quality of book publishing that offers a haven for talented authors.

 
Risks & Challenges
We are confident that we have built a solid background to convert WBP into a successful cooperative; however, we also realize that unexpected challenges may arise. 


We don’t meet our fundraising goal: While we feel that we have set a reasonable and achievable goal, in the event that we don’t reach it, there is a contingency plan.           
If we reach an amount suitable for legal fees, we will continue with our plan but at a slower rate to gain the extra operating funds.
If we are not able to cover legal costs, we will use the remaining donations to create a one-time scholarship for a promising writer.



We find that after six months, we cannot sustain the co-op: After the first six months, we will assess the success and needs of WBP, and make adjustments accordingly.  We feel confident that we can overcome any adversity to find creative and realistic ways of keeping the co-op going. 

 
Other Ways You Can Help

<p><strong>“As It Is In Heaven – The Mystery of Harp Worship Restored”</strong> is a landmark book being written by Psalmist and international harp instructor, Michael-David. It's message is desperately needed by Christians today. The book will address a powerful dynamic in prayer as well as the spiritual significance of how God is restoring the harp in these End Times. The timely reality of this book touches the heart of the concept of the Restoration of the Tabernacle of David and the time clock of the Nation of Israel. The Jewish people hung up their harps when they were led captive in Babylon. The prophecy in Amos 9 says when Israel permanently returns to the Land, David's Tabernacle will be restored... and with that, the harp. You can help get this important message out by helping to publish this book.</p>
<p>Though this discussion about harps may seem a bit obscure and narrow in its subject matter, it is not. You will find that what seemed to be a narrow topic, encompasses a significant aspect of End Times prophecy. Because of the spiritually strategic time that we are living in, these truths will come alive when you read this book. You will be surprised at how universally relevant this topic is.  With over 20,000 Prayer Houses around the world with what they call “harp and bowl” intercession, this movement is responding to the current wave of interest in harp worship that is touching the destiny of nations right now. At present only a few are actually using harps. But this is changing as the revelation of the harp paradigm is more fully understood. God is restoring the use of the harp to be used along with both traditional and contemporary worship instruments.</p>
<p>Michael-David is perhaps the world’s leading expert in the field of harp worship. He brings a unique perspective as he answers the questions “Why the Harp”, “Why Now?”,  and “What Does this Mean to You – Even if you Don’t Play the Harp”. This book is essential for Church leaders, musicians, worshippers and intercessors who will enhance the effectiveness of their prayers when they are impacted by a fresh understanding of this new paradigm. In fact, Christians everywhere will find this book relevant, captivating and a must read for these last days.</p>
<p>In Jeremiah 6:16 we are told to “stand at the crossroads and ask for the ancient path, for there you will find rest for your soul”. A clear understanding of this shift in spiritual climate is needed to tap into the benefits of ancient truths that King David, the greatest harpist of all, left as a prophetic legacy that is now being fulfilled in these end times. Topics include: How our prayers manifest before the Throne of God, How to increase the effectiveness of our prayers, How to create an atmosphere inviting the presence of God, and stories of the miraculous that have taken place with the ministry of the harp.</p>
<p>The resurgence of the harp as shown in the recent unprecedented popularity of the harp has spawned unexpected demand for harps. Manufacturers like Rees Harps Inc. with their popular line of Harpsicle Harps and family-run workshops making custom handcrafted harps, like Marini Made Harps, have difficulties keeping up with orders due to this phenomena. This inspiring book will explain the spiritual significance of this grassroots movement and why this is relevant to you.</p>
<p>You have an elder playing a harp over your prayers in heaven right now! Most people do not understand what is happening or why. That is why we need your help to publish this book NOW!</p>

<p>When we met, all that Ray Hughes had said and much more regarding Michael-David’s music and ministry was so clearly evident.</p>
<p>I have heard world class harpists from all across the land and several from around the world. Michael-David’s music and spirit are so filled with the authority of God that Becky and I, including our Executive Staff, Rev. Stan and Nancy Patterson, were deeply moved.</p>

The demons attack the Keep and the children must find the magic swords and defend their home.

I was a meteorologist in the Navy where I wrote training manuals for members of the Navy Reserve.Dragon’s Keep literally came into being as a story that I told my children and grandchildren on Christmas Eve. The grandchildren were tired and grumpy after opening presents and getting ready to leave. I sat in a chair in the living room and told them that I had a story for them. I began with the Keep and told them of the dragon pressed into service as a babysitter while their parents went to the capitol to help the King. The demons attack the Keep and the children must find the magic swords and defend their home. As the story unfolded, the children came closer and closer until they were sitting in a circle at my feet. I glanced up and saw their parents sitting down and listening intently. I knew then, I had to write the story.I’m still surprised that I’ve written it. The chapters flew out of my mind onto the page. I could hear the characters talking and watched what they did and then wrote what I heard and saw. It was amazing. Editing, adding and subtracting, has been just as surprising. The next book is The Windward Range (already started) followed by Ard Ri. The last two in the series are Falcon’s Spire and ShapeShifter.Please join me in bringing this story to the world. I can’t tell you how excited I am to get this done!What I Need My goal is to publish in March 2017. Professional editing, book cover, interior design and publication are essential to make this the best novel possible. I need to hire a professional content editor for $1400, interior designer (yes, books need to be designed so that chapters fall in the right place, page numbering is correct, borders take into account the binding, etc., etc.) for $1500, professional cover design for $800, ISBN numbers: 10 @ $35 ea = $350, professional publication and distribution $500. That comes to $4550.00. I’ve already invested $650 for my website, professional photos and the video you can see above.& What You GetFunding Levels:$5   – name listed as contributor on my website.$10 – a certificate of appreciation and name listed on my website.$25 – echapter of Dragon’s Keep, certificate of appreciation and name listed on my website.$75 - ebook of Dragon’s Keep, certificate of appreciation and name listed on my website.$100 – signed paperback copy of Dragon’s Keep, a free ebook copy of Dragon’s Keep, certificate of appreciation and name listed on my website.$200 & above - signed hardback copy of Dragon’s Keep, paperback and ebook copy of Dragon’s Keep, certificate of appreciation and name listed on my website.If I don’t reach my goal, I’ll still use the funds to do as much as I can to finish the publication process.

<p><i><strong>Cautious Fred </strong></i>is a rhyming story of a little green frog walking home from school through a thick, eerie bog. Along the way, he meets several shifty characters – a crafty croc, a sneaky snake, a beautiful but sharp-clawed lizard, and other suspicious creatures. With his mother’s advice ringing in his ears, Freddy must remember to keep safe on his own. </p>
<p><strong>The story is designed to teach elementary-aged children how to be cautious when they are by themselves </strong>– whether walking to and from school, going to the park or their friend’s houses, or even when they join us for errands. We can’t keep our eyes on our children 100% of the time, and as they get older, we want them to become more independent – and that includes knowing how to be aware of their surroundings and the people around them.</p>
<p><strong>This isn’t a “Stranger Danger” book.</strong> Numerous studies and countless experts have repeatedly said that “Stranger Danger” is a message that often confuses children: should they talk to police officers, who are also strangers? Do they say hi to an adult who says hi to them?</p>
<p>We don’t want to discourage children’s friendliness, nor teach them to be afraid of people who can help them. That’s why <strong><i>Cautious Fred</i> shows kids not only how to be aware of suspicious people, but more importantly, suspicious situations</strong>, which are a bit harder to detect and can occur with both strangers and people they know. </p>
<p>Freddy runs into several different situations, all with very different characters – some are beautiful, some are friendly; some look like they are hurt and need help. Throughout the story, Freddy follows his intuition and acts wisely, teaching kids to do the same.</p>

<p>As a mom of two, I care about my children’s safety, a feeling I’m sure all parents share. So, I wrote this book out of a passion to assist parents and all caregivers in their efforts to teach children how to be safe on their own. What also fueled me to write <i>Cautious Fred</i> was my husband’s experience as a child. While walking home from school with his older sister, a woman in a station wagon pulled up and asked them if they wanted some candy.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487046165/r5il4sfk33qpq6i9knak.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>He headed towards the car, but his sister pulled him away and shouted, “Let’s get out of here!” and the woman quickly drove off. While it’s great nothing worse happened to them, the thing that always stuck out in my mind was: what if his sister wasn’t there that day? I’ve heard similar stories from others, who have had close calls themselves. Cautious Fred empowers children with the knowledge of what to do in such situations.</p>

<p>This book is a labor of love with lots of patience mixed in. After completing the manuscript, my husband and two children joined in helping me with the layout and sketches. Most nights we sat at the table determining the characters’ look, placement, and roughly sketching the scene for each page. Then we sent our rough sketches to our South African illustrator, Katlego Kgabale, also known as Kady.

In this book, my co-author James Tracy and I will tell the story of an important anti-fascist organization from the 1980s.

Since working with Catalyst, I have traveled all over the US and Europe supporting organizations fighting against white supremacy. I have worked with people that take up really different approaches.

They faced many of the same challenges that anti-racist organizations deal with today. Your solidarity will help me focus on writing, researching, and editing our book. I am currently working-extremely part time. Today’s resurgence of the organized racist right motivates me to do this work. My experiences growing up white and working-poor in the California Sierra Nevada foothills lit a fire in me to build strong and compelling anti racist movements that can win. And as Trump ends the DACA program and Steve Bannon tours Europe speaking to coalitions of white nationalists, we are in desperate need of stories from people who traversed these waters before us. Will you help me raise $5,000? Our deadline is November 30th of this year and, with your help, $5,000 will cover the expenses of researching this under-documented history. I joined the Catalyst Project collective in 2014 as co-coordinator, supporting grassroots groups across the country to strengthen their anti-racist campaigns. Since working with Catalyst, I have traveled all over the US and Europe supporting organizations fighting against white supremacy. I have worked with people that take up really different approaches. The one thing I have heard consistently, despite where people live, what language they speak, or their political background, is the need to know who has done this work before. They want to know what worked and what did not. They want to hear what people learned. They want to know what was happening at that moment in history that made some choices strategic and some counter productive. Basically, they want to know that they aren't alone.  I've done projects like this before.  In 2009, I co-founded the Mobilization for Climate Justice West and wrote about the lessons from that organizing in Organizing Cools the Planet: Tools and Reflections to Navigate the Climate Crisis (PM Press). I am passionate about action and reflection together and I believe writing out stories and lessons helps to incite ideas, experiments, and increase the impact of radical change. Please support this book by donating $10, $20, $50, $100, or $200 now. With your help, we can write the lessons waiting in our anti fascist movement history. Please share this with two friends you know who would be interested in reading No Fascist USA! when it comes out. Thank you!!Hilary",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>The September Issues gives women creatives the opportunity to express themselves freely, explore their identities, and build a community without any constraints—a place where art, beauty, fashion, and topical issues can be discussed from a purely feminine perspective; a community that reflects the diversity and power of global femininity.</p>
<p>We are unique in that this is a biannual magazine made by women.  Each issue will donate a portion of its proceeds to an organization which supports women.  For this issue, we have chosen Planned Parenthood. Our goal is to make fashion, an industry intrinsically linked with the rights of women, a feminist issue. </p>
<p>We celebrate <i>all</i> types of women, which is why the theme of our first issue is “The Power of the Femme.” All of our contributors for this issue have been asked to interpret this concept as they wish, because female empowerment isn’t just a marketing gimmick on a t-shirt—it’s a point that has become impossible to ignore. </p>
<p>The magazine aims to share ideas of identity, discover ritual and ceremony; celebrate and champion women pioneers of the past and present, and those yet to come—exchanging the story of women’s lives through visual and intellectual vocabularies. </p>
<p>Politically, the world is fragmented. Recent events have demonstrated that change is most definitely the only thing we can be sure of in this moment. We, The September Issues want to be an active part of that change. We want to empower women by celebrating their achievements, and strive for the creation of an influential voice of equality in our future society. </p>

become one of the most influential civilizations of all time. They left a
legal, linguistic, and philosophical legacy that remains with us today. The
ruins of roman cities inspire the imagination of all who see them. Most
civilizations today owe their very existence to ancient Rome. The loss of ancient Roman society is a tragedy and that is why we are working to rebuild it
in modern times.<br/><br/>
<p>Today, Europe and the world are in economic and political
turmoil. A rebuilt Rome can bring stabilization to the region. It will be able
to bring jobs and progress. But we need your help to make this dream a reality.</p>
<p>Join us as we rebuild this once great civilization and
restore it to its former glory.</p>
<h2>Plan of Action</h2>
<p>Rebuilding ancient Rome is not some impossible dream. With
the proper planning and participation it can be accomplished and in a short
time. You are probably questioning how Rome can be rebuilt. Let's give you the answer:</p>
<p><b>Phase 1 – A Voice For Change</b></p>
<p>The first phase of this project will involve laying the
foundation for the movement that will rebuild Rome. We have no false notions that this movement will become popular
overnight. It will start small and take great effort to grow.</p>
<p>The first part of this project will involve establishing
both online and real world groups of supporters. We will hold online and real
world meetings where we will seek solutions for local problems, strengthen each
other, and advocate change.</p>
<p>We will also be establishing the foundation for the Roman
Economy. This will include the minting of Roman coinage which will be made of
valuable metals. These will serve to back paper and digital currency. There will also be an online currency system established so
that members can buy and sell using Roman money.</p>
<p>Additionally we will support humanitarian projects and
charities under the name of Rome. Our primary goal is to positively change
lives and we want to start this from the very beginning.</p>
<p><b>Phase 2 – Realizing Change</b></p>
<p>The second phase of this project will be devoted to realizing
change in local laws and encouraging Roman citizenship. </p>
<p>We will be actively advocating citizenship in Rome and will
be using advertisements and local activism to do so. Gatherings of members will
continue and citizens will engage in peaceful rallies and
protests.</p>
<p>Citizens will be active in the political
process. This means that they will not only be advocating change to local
leaders, but also running for political office where able. The change that will be advocated is a simplification of legal processes (decreasing bureaucracy)
and a return to Roman law*.</p>
<p>There will be economic and business investments made during
this time. These will be done to increase the economic power of Roman society.<br/></p>
<p>Charitable projects will continue during this phase as well.
They will be moved more toward Roman-centric projects under Roman run
charities.</p><p><i>* We recognize that much social change and progress has taken place since Roman times. We advocate the return to Roman law, but also the revision of those laws to include these changes.</i><br/></p>
<p><b>Phase 3 – Political Involvement</b></p>
<p>The third phase of this project will involve increasing
involvement of political and business leaders in Roman society. It is during
this phase that the Roman movement will be advantageous enough that nations
will take Rome seriously as a viable option.</p>
<p>Political leaders of various countries in Roman territories
will be encouraged to become involved in Rome. In addition to public support
for nations to join with Rome there will be economic and political incentives.
These incentives will be things like: stronger economic alliances, more stable politics, greater influence in global politics. These will bring a push for Roman society on two fronts. Both from the general
populace and from political leaders.</p>
<p>We will also advocate participation in Roman society to business
leaders. There will be incentives given for businesses to get involved in the rebuilding
of Roman civilization. These incentives will include things like business contracts, access to new markets, and and economically stronger customer base.<br/></p>
<h2>Why Rome Should be Rebuilt?</h2>
<p>Other than the ""cool"" factor there are many reasons why the
Roman civilization should be rebuilt.</p>
<p><b>Stable Economy</b> – The European economy is based on fractional
reserve banking. This basically means that money is made up out of thin air. Unsurprisingly
this system is failing. The Roman economy will be built on currency backed by
precious metals. Because precious metals have intrinsic value, Roman currency
will be much stronger than the Euro.</p>
<p><b>Simplified Government</b> – As time goes on and legal decisions
are made, the laws of a nation becomes cumbersome. Just as Justinian reformed and streamlined
the legal code; we too will cut away the dead weight and excess bureaucracy. We
will institute a legal code based on ancient Roman law modified to meet modern
needs.</p>
<p><b>Leading Edge of Technology</b> – A rebuilt Rome will advocate
progress in technology and industry. This will create jobs and advances in
communication, energy, medicine, and many other areas.</p>
<p><b>Stabilize Volatile Regions</b> – There is a great deal of
turmoil in some regions of Europe. A rebuilt Roman civilization will be able to stabilize these
regions through political and economic advances. </p>
<p><b>Improve Infrastructure</b> – A rebuilt Rome will be able to
quickly institute advanced infrastructure including transportation and energy. Today
advances are being made in the areas of solar, wind, wave, and other energy
production systems. There will also be developments made in agriculture and self-sufficiency
of communities.</p>
<p><b>Reduce Cost of Living</b> – With a stronger economy, advanced
infrastructure, and greater self-sufficiency, the cost of living will go down
and quality of life will go up.</p>
<p><b>Provide Jobs</b> – The opportunities and projects developed by a rebuilt Rome
will bring more jobs. More jobs will in turn boost the economy.</p>
<h2>What Do We Need?</h2>
<p>To get this movement started we are gathering funds for the
completion of Phase 1. These funds will be is directed at three main projects.
These projects are building the economy, promoting the movement, and charity.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457628567/wkj9lnwij2bf05avg4t9.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>*These percentages are based on money after perks are fulfilled.<br/><p></p>
<p><b>Build up the Roman Economy</b> – One of the first things we will
do is start building a stable Roman economy. We will be minting Roman coins as
well as opening an online banking system. The coins we will mint will be based
on ancient Roman denominations: Aureus (gold), Solidus (gold), Antoninianus (silver), Denarius (Silver), Quinarius
Argentus (Silver), Sestertius (brass), Dupondis (brass), As (copper), Semis
(bronze), Quadrans (bronze), Uncia (bronze).</p>
<p>Because we live in a digital age our online banking system
will probably be used more than coins. However, the coins will be used as
backing for the digital and paper money system. This will help stabilize the
European economy because, instead of fiat currency, money will be backed
by something that actually has value.</p><p>To Summarize how we will be using <em>€52.5</em>00:</p><p>- Mint coins</p><p>- Establish online currency system</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>Promote the Movement</b> - We will also be using the money to
promote the movement. Information is key to any successful movement.
Supporters are gained as they learn about the benefits a movement will bring.
That is why we will be creating multilingual booklets, flyers, etc. These will
be used to inform people about the rebuilding of the Roman government. This
money will also be used to organize public gatherings.</p><p></p><p>To Summarize how we will be using <em>€</em>22.500:</p><p>- Print promotional material<br/></p><p>- Advertisements<br/></p><p>- Fund meetings and gatherings</p><p>- Website and hosting<br/></p><br/>
<p><b>Charity</b> – We want to directly help people in the area of the
ancient Roman government. Half of the money we raise will go directly towards charitable projects, including disaster relief, medical care for children, etc. We
want to help improve the quality of life for people in Roman lands. A public accounting of
this money will be made so you will know exactly where your money
is going.</p><p></p><p>To Summarize how we will be using <em>€</em>75.000:</p><p>- Provide food for the poor.<br/></p><p>- Assist impoverished children.</p><p>- Support community improvement.<br/></p>- Etc.<br/><p><br/></p><p><b>Perks</b> – Some of the money you contribute will go towards providing you with awesome perks. This covers things like purchasing, packaging, shipping, etc. Fulfilling perks is calculated to be approximately 10% of contributions. To reach our funding level we need to add another <em>€</em>15.000 to our total to account for that. <br/></p><p> <br/></p><h2>What You Get</h2>

<p><b>Who is running this project?</b></p>
<p>This project is run by a group of European and American
enthusiasts of ancient Rome, who want to see a revitalization of the society
that founded western civilization. We have a variety of experiences and
backgrounds. You can learn more about us and even chat with us on our facebook
group.</p>
<p><b>Are you serious?</b></p>
<p>We are very serious. Rebuilding the roman government will be
beneficial to Europe and the world. When established, the roman government will
be able to bring benefits to the area including improved economy, jobs, and
more streamlined government interaction.</p>
<p><b>Why rebuild the Roman government?</b></p>
<p>The ancient roman civilization laid the foundation for
modern life. And the restoration of the Roman government would benefit, not only
Europe, but also the world. Ancient Rome is understood to have been a forerunner
in innovation and technology. We can bring these qualities back, and create
innovations that will not only improve the quality of life in Europe, but also
around the world.</p>
<p>Many people falsely believe that the Roman government fell
in 476AD. The truth is history is much more complicated than that. The Roman government continued in the east for another
977 years. Also in 800AD the Pope gave the title of Roman Emperor to
Charlemagne. On that date the roman government was effectively reestablished in
the west.<br/></p>
<p>This Roman government ended only relatively recently, in 1806, when
Francis II abdicated the title of <i>Imperator
Romanorum</i>. This means that over the past 2768 years only 209 of those have
been without a Roman government.</p>
<p>Religiously speaking, Rome has continued to the present day
through the Roman Catholic Church and the Pope, as well as through the Eastern
Orthodox Church.</p>
<p>Anciently people of all varieties of ethnicity were Roman. Thus as an ethnicity, Roman, continues on to this very day through the many inhabitants of
Europe.</p>
<p>In some ways Rome is alive and well in religious and
ethnographic spheres. It is our desire to bring it back in the political realm.</p>
<p><b>Are you trying to restore a specific era in Roman History?</b></p>
<p>Yes and no. We look to the classic roman era as a guide.
However, at the same time it would be foolish to ignore developments in recent
history. Rome’s history spans the time of the kings, the Roman Republic, the
Roman Empire, the “Byzantine” Empire, and by some measures the Holy Roman
Empire.</p>
<p>There have not only been many technological advances in
recent history, but also great social advances. Our goal is to look back to
classic Rome while also integrating modern advancements.<br/></p>
<p><b>Has someone already proclaimed them self Emperor?</b></p>
<p>No. This movement is a serious attempt at rebuilding the Roman
government. We reject delusional, self-declared, claims to the title of emperor. </p>
<p><b>What happens if this campaign doesn’t reach its goal?</b></p>
<p>If the campaign doesn’t reach its goal, the money will be
used to accomplish as much of our goal as possible. Your money will be used to
the fullest extent to make a modern Roman government a reality.</p><p></p><p><b>When will perks be delivered?<br/></b></p>
<p>All digital perks will be fulfilled within 1-2 days. All physical perks will be fulfilled after the campaign has finished and funding has been received.<br/></p>
<p><b>Is this project open to people all over the world?</b></p>
<p>Yes. This project is for people all over the world. We have members in Europe, the United States, and other places.</p>
<p>Ancient Roman citizenry included people from a wide variety of ethnicities. We continue this today
by keeping membership open to people everywhere.</p>
<p><b>Is this legal?</b></p>
<p>Forming a new nation is something that is a complex process. Most
countries today were formed by breaking away from a mother country. Is it legal
for a new nation to break away from their mother country? Certainly, the new nation
and the mother country would have differing views.<br/></p>
<p>However, our goal is not to rebuild Rome through separation which
could be deemed illegal. Instead our goal is to gather popular support for the
unification of existing nations. We want to see a peaceful unification of European nations to rebuild Rome. So, yes, our effort are legal.<br/></p>
<p><b>Why would a country want to leave the EU and join a Roman government?</b></p>
<p>We carry no delusions that nations will clamor to join us. Clearly, in the early stages there is no reason for any existing government to join this movement. This is expected, and our plan takes this into account.
However, major changes usually come from small beginnings. As the people behind
the Roman movement grow in numbers, our economy increases in strength, and political activism spreads; uniting with Rome will become a more attractive and viable option.<br/>

What is This?Founded 2,700 years ago, Rome grew to
become one of the most influential civilizations of all time. They left a
legal, linguistic, and philosophical legacy that remains with us today. The
ruins of roman cities inspire the imagination of all who see them. Most
civilizations today owe their very existence to ancient Rome. The loss of ancient Roman society is a tragedy and that is why we are working to rebuild it
in modern times.
Today, Europe and the world are in economic and political
turmoil. A rebuilt Rome can bring stabilization to the region. It will be able
to bring jobs and progress. But we need your help to make this dream a reality.
Join us as we rebuild this once great civilization and
restore it to its former glory.
Plan of Action
Rebuilding ancient Rome is not some impossible dream. With
the proper planning and participation it can be accomplished and in a short
time. You are probably questioning how Rome can be rebuilt. Let's give you the answer:
Phase 1 – A Voice For Change
The first phase of this project will involve laying the
foundation for the movement that will rebuild Rome. We have no false notions that this movement will become popular
overnight. It will start small and take great effort to grow.
The first part of this project will involve establishing
both online and real world groups of supporters. We will hold online and real
world meetings where we will seek solutions for local problems, strengthen each
other, and advocate change.
We will also be establishing the foundation for the Roman
Economy. This will include the minting of Roman coinage which will be made of
valuable metals. These will serve to back paper and digital currency. There will also be an online currency system established so
that members can buy and sell using Roman money.
Additionally we will support humanitarian projects and
charities under the name of Rome. Our primary goal is to positively change
lives and we want to start this from the very beginning.
Phase 2 – Realizing Change
The second phase of this project will be devoted to realizing
change in local laws and encouraging Roman citizenship. 
We will be actively advocating citizenship in Rome and will
be using advertisements and local activism to do so. Gatherings of members will
continue and citizens will engage in peaceful rallies and
protests.
Citizens will be active in the political
process. This means that they will not only be advocating change to local
leaders, but also running for political office where able. The change that will be advocated is a simplification of legal processes (decreasing bureaucracy)
and a return to Roman law*.
There will be economic and business investments made during
this time. These will be done to increase the economic power of Roman society.
Charitable projects will continue during this phase as well.
They will be moved more toward Roman-centric projects under Roman run
charities.* We recognize that much social change and progress has taken place since Roman times. We advocate the return to Roman law, but also the revision of those laws to include these changes.
Phase 3 – Political Involvement
The third phase of this project will involve increasing
involvement of political and business leaders in Roman society. It is during
this phase that the Roman movement will be advantageous enough that nations
will take Rome seriously as a viable option.
Political leaders of various countries in Roman territories
will be encouraged to become involved in Rome. In addition to public support
for nations to join with Rome there will be economic and political incentives.
These incentives will be things like: stronger economic alliances, more stable politics, greater influence in global politics. These will bring a push for Roman society on two fronts. Both from the general
populace and from political leaders.
We will also advocate participation in Roman society to business
leaders. There will be incentives given for businesses to get involved in the rebuilding
of Roman civilization. These incentives will include things like business contracts, access to new markets, and and economically stronger customer base.
Why Rome Should be Rebuilt?
Other than the ""cool"" factor there are many reasons why the
Roman civilization should be rebuilt.
Stable Economy – The European economy is based on fractional
reserve banking. This basically means that money is made up out of thin air. Unsurprisingly
this system is failing. The Roman economy will be built on currency backed by
precious metals. Because precious metals have intrinsic value, Roman currency
will be much stronger than the Euro.
Simplified Government – As time goes on and legal decisions
are made, the laws of a nation becomes cumbersome. Just as Justinian reformed and streamlined
the legal code; we too will cut away the dead weight and excess bureaucracy. We
will institute a legal code based on ancient Roman law modified to meet modern
needs.
Leading Edge of Technology – A rebuilt Rome will advocate
progress in technology and industry. This will create jobs and advances in
communication, energy, medicine, and many other areas.
Stabilize Volatile Regions – There is a great deal of
turmoil in some regions of Europe. A rebuilt Roman civilization will be able to stabilize these
regions through political and economic advances. 
Improve Infrastructure – A rebuilt Rome will be able to
quickly institute advanced infrastructure including transportation and energy. Today
advances are being made in the areas of solar, wind, wave, and other energy
production systems. There will also be developments made in agriculture and self-sufficiency
of communities.
Reduce Cost of Living – With a stronger economy, advanced
infrastructure, and greater self-sufficiency, the cost of living will go down
and quality of life will go up.
Provide Jobs – The opportunities and projects developed by a rebuilt Rome
will bring more jobs. More jobs will in turn boost the economy.
What Do We Need?
To get this movement started we are gathering funds for the
completion of Phase 1. These funds will be is directed at three main projects.
These projects are building the economy, promoting the movement, and charity.*These percentages are based on money after perks are fulfilled.
Build up the Roman Economy – One of the first things we will
do is start building a stable Roman economy. We will be minting Roman coins as
well as opening an online banking system. The coins we will mint will be based
on ancient Roman denominations: Aureus (gold), Solidus (gold), Antoninianus (silver), Denarius (Silver), Quinarius
Argentus (Silver), Sestertius (brass), Dupondis (brass), As (copper), Semis
(bronze), Quadrans (bronze), Uncia (bronze).
Because we live in a digital age our online banking system
will probably be used more than coins. However, the coins will be used as
backing for the digital and paper money system. This will help stabilize the
European economy because, instead of fiat currency, money will be backed
by something that actually has value.To Summarize how we will be using €52.500:- Mint coins- Establish online currency system
Promote the Movement - We will also be using the money to
promote the movement. Information is key to any successful movement.
Supporters are gained as they learn about the benefits a movement will bring.
That is why we will be creating multilingual booklets, flyers, etc. These will
be used to inform people about the rebuilding of the Roman government. This
money will also be used to organize public gatherings.To Summarize how we will be using €22.500:- Print promotional material- Advertisements- Fund meetings and gatherings- Website and hosting
Charity – We want to directly help people in the area of the
ancient Roman government. Half of the money we raise will go directly towards charitable projects, including disaster relief, medical care for children, etc. We
want to help improve the quality of life for people in Roman lands. A public accounting of
this money will be made so you will know exactly where your money
is going.To Summarize how we will be using €75.000:- Provide food for the poor.- Assist impoverished children.- Support community improvement.- Etc.Perks – Some of the money you contribute will go towards providing you with awesome perks. This covers things like purchasing, packaging, shipping, etc. Fulfilling perks is calculated to be approximately 10% of contributions. To reach our funding level we need to add another €15.000 to our total to account for that.  What You Get

<p>Message from Rennie and Eleana</p>
<p>First, we just want to thank you for taking the time to stop by my Indiegogo campaign page. Myself along with my Daughter, Eleana Curran, created this children's book and hope that you will take a minute to further explore my campaign initiative.  You will soon understand that this is bigger than just a book. Bigger than you. Bigger than me. This is about inspiring and encouraging children to chase their dreams and to help them realize that they are special as long as they believe.</p>
<p>This is about providing much needed motivational resources to our children both in the United States and abroad. Should you graciously decide to make a donation, I would like to personally thank you for not just your financial contribution, but more importantly for joining our cause and helping to touch the lives of so many!</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered if you have an alter ego? By learning other languages you can find a new identity, but what about a new personality?</p>

<p>I used to play in the theatre when I was in high school, still being a sad monolingual person. That is when I discovered that I had to observe people in order to play a particular character.</p>
<p>When I was 15 I faced a hard choice. I was so emotionally involved in theatre that I gave serious thought to entering the Academy of Theatre in Moscow.

The Impact
This book is based on my scientific research and my teenage dream of opening a language school - now realised in Amolingua. 
I've given a lecture on my scientific work at New York University, Moscow State University and University of Edinburgh and giving a TEDx talk at the University of Saint Andrews at the end of April. 



This piece is a combination of my scientific research and practical experience around the world during my work at G20, EUDC, WUDC, WMC, EU Commission, NATO-RNC, Council of Europe together with meetings with entrepreneurs, investors and finance people around the globe. 
This particular field of study is still emerging as it combines linguistics, cross-cultural communication, socio-cultural anthropology, behavioural economics, experimental psychology, neurolinguistics, etc. And we need to develop it and raise the cultural awareness to succeed in our communication on a international level.
This book is the first milestone on the way to a better understanding between diverse parties in professional spheres around the globe.

We do a great deal of ""hand selling"", where people from all over the central United States get exposed to our books. The marketplace is a noisy and crowded place and this is how we've managed to rise above the noise. <br/><br/>There are a handful of markets that elude us. Usually because of cost and timing. We've taken some steps on our side with the timing challenges, but that still leaves the cost. We are not asking for you to foot the bill for travel, food, hotel, etc. We are asking that you help us out with three shows in particular; the LA Festival of Books, Southern Festival of Books (Nashville), and Boston Book Fair. These events will place us in front of  a quarter million people or more. But, combined expenses to attend just these three shows is close to $7,000.   This is where you come in. If you can help us out here, we can find new audiences for our authors. The LA Festival of Books is on the campus of USC and is frequented by countless movie and television producers, etc. Imagine that level of exposure. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>So, we broke down the cost to purchase the exhibitor space at these three events, and that is our target.  Pretty simple. Now, keep in mind, IndieGoGo gets a percentage, the credit card people get a percentage, and of course the perks cost money to produce and ship. So, when all is said and done, we will see about 65% of this money. </p>
<p>The perks are pretty standard for a book related campaign. You get eBooks, paperback books, hardback books, and more. There's even a few opportunities to find yourself included in the actual story, including Jessica McHugh's eagerly awaited sequel to RABBITS IN THE GARDEN, HARES IN THE HEDGEROW. Or, if Renn Faires and undead skinless bunnies are your thing, you could make a cameo in book three of Josef Matulich's ARCANUM FAIRE series. </p>
<p>There's also a chance to hang out with the PMP crew at an event, get fed, and leave with an arm full of books and swag! Party with PMP!. </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">The Impact</span><br/></p>
</div><div> <p>More than anything, we want to get our books in front of more readers. Into new markets. The impact can be as simple as a young reader finds a new author to follow, or a journeyman of the small press game gets noticed by the people in the ivory tower. Bottom line, more unique people means more readers, which means more books.  You are helping your favorite authors grow! </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<div>The risk is minimal here, as every little bit helps. But, we have a plan. </div>We selected a flexible funding plan that means we will get some money, even if we don't reach our goal - so don't let that number scare you. We will do this progressively. If we earn enough for one of three, we'll go to that one. If we earn more, we'll attend more events. If we don't earn enough for either of these three, we will still use the money to attend smaller shows we have never attended before. The goal remains the same, broaden the audience for our authors.  Say we can't afford Los Angeles, we may still visit Minneapolis or maybe St Louis, Philadelphia, Baltimore, or DC (sounds like the lyrics to <i>Dancing in the Street</i>) </div><div><br/></div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Even if you can't contribute, that's okay. Take a moment to share this campaign with your friends and people you know who are readers. Follow us on Twitter, like us on Facebook, you know, all the social media stuff.  Even the smallest effort can help and we are truly grateful. </p>

The marketplace is a noisy and crowded place and this is how we've managed to rise above the noise. There are a handful of markets that elude us. Usually because of cost and timing. We've taken some steps on our side with the timing challenges, but that still leaves the cost. We are not asking for you to foot the bill for travel, food, hotel, etc. We are asking that you help us out with three shows in particular; the LA Festival of Books, Southern Festival of Books (Nashville), and Boston Book Fair. These events will place us in front of  a quarter million people or more. But, combined expenses to attend just these three shows is close to $7,000.   This is where you come in. If you can help us out here, we can find new audiences for our authors. The LA Festival of Books is on the campus of USC and is frequented by countless movie and television producers, etc. Imagine that level of exposure.    What We Need & What You Get So, we broke down the cost to purchase the exhibitor space at these three events, and that is our target.  Pretty simple. Now, keep in mind, IndieGoGo gets a percentage, the credit card people get a percentage, and of course the perks cost money to produce and ship. So, when all is said and done, we will see about 65% of this money. 
The perks are pretty standard for a book related campaign. You get eBooks, paperback books, hardback books, and more. There's even a few opportunities to find yourself included in the actual story, including Jessica McHugh's eagerly awaited sequel to RABBITS IN THE GARDEN, HARES IN THE HEDGEROW. Or, if Renn Faires and undead skinless bunnies are your thing, you could make a cameo in book three of Josef Matulich's ARCANUM FAIRE series. 
There's also a chance to hang out with the PMP crew at an event, get fed, and leave with an arm full of books and swag! Party with PMP!. 
The Impact
 More than anything, we want to get our books in front of more readers. Into new markets. The impact can be as simple as a young reader finds a new author to follow, or a journeyman of the small press game gets noticed by the people in the ivory tower. Bottom line, more unique people means more readers, which means more books.  You are helping your favorite authors grow! 
    Risks & Challenges  
The risk is minimal here, as every little bit helps. But, we have a plan. We selected a flexible funding plan that means we will get some money, even if we don't reach our goal - so don't let that number scare you. We will do this progressively. If we earn enough for one of three, we'll go to that one. If we earn more, we'll attend more events. If we don't earn enough for either of these three, we will still use the money to attend smaller shows we have never attended before. The goal remains the same, broaden the audience for our authors.  Say we can't afford Los Angeles, we may still visit Minneapolis or maybe St Louis, Philadelphia, Baltimore, or DC (sounds like the lyrics to Dancing in the Street)   Other Ways You Can Help Even if you can't contribute, that's okay. Take a moment to share this campaign with your friends and people you know who are readers. Follow us on Twitter, like us on Facebook, you know, all the social media stuff.  Even the smallest effort can help and we are truly grateful.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

The idea that the cloud accompanies the child and transforms him from sad and isolated to a friend that helps you not be lonely is very accurate. When a person has the opportunity in his childhood to find the right words for his differences, emotions and thoughts (that the cloud metaphorically symbolizes) and to befriend it, he becomes accepting of others’ differences and gains better understanding. When you don’t have the words or description for what makes you sad and lonely, this can turn into fear and become anger and hatred towards others who are different.</p><p>If this little book comes to a child at the right time, it can make the world a cosier and better place, in which differences, emotions and thoughts of others don’t scare them or cause racism and segregation.</p><p>Parents can use the book to speak with their child about emotions and their meanings. The book presents an opportunity for the child to put their emotions and feelings into words, so as to learn to distinguish and understands them.”  -<i> </i><i>TOLK</i><i> Family and Children Psychoanalytic Insititute (B.Banova &amp; V.Banova) </i></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565987108/vtqixn6ljzu6pjmlx9s3.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570748339/y6sahfaeozwylnev4hcl.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570751425/yzstts2o5xdgjebgcfqk.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Now, Ornella and Wizards of Fables need your help to get this remarkable book in the hands of more children, parents and people struggling with depression, anxiety, loss or bullying.

Through games and play, the child accepts who he is and learns to manage his emotions better, opening the door to a happy childhood. The book is written by Ornella Kotupanova - Sole, a single mom with terminal cancer. Knowing that she might not live long enough to guide her son through life’s hard moments and help him understand his emotions, she wanted to leave a living legacy in the form of a book.Ornella recalls battling with depression and bullying in her school years and she realised many other children are going through the same thing. Mental health at a young age is extremely important, yet there’s a lack of supporting materials and tools to help children cope with things they often can’t explain, spell out or make sense of. This book is a solution that could even be implemented in our school system, as suggested by a social worker who read the story. Ornella found a handful of incredible creatives and professionals who were happy to work tirelessly and bring this project to life. They formed a company, called Wizards of Fables and produced 3 amazing packs with a great educational and interactive value for children of different ages.  The book comes in three packs Mage, Sorcerer and Wizard pack.MAGE pack is our basic package which includes one copy of our book 'The Little Cloud That Follows Me Around' printed on fine recycled paper packed with love in our branded gift packaging.SORCERER pack is our middle package which includes one copy of our book 'The Little Cloud That Follows Me Around' printed on fine recycled paper and one refillable interactive journal. The journal includes calendar pages, inspirational and motivational quotes, project planner, colouring, drawing and writing pages as well as tested children's therapeutic games created with the help of top experienced family and children psychiatrist. All of the above comes in our branded gift packaging.WIZARD pack is our luxurious package which includes one copy of our book 'The Little Cloud That Follows Me Around' printed on fine recycled paper, one refillable interactive journal, a mood meter flashcard and parent manual. The journal includes calendar pages, inspirational and motivational quotes, project planner, colouring, drawing and writing pages as well as tested children's therapeutic games created with the help of top experienced family and children psychiatrist. The flashcards and the parent manual are the perfect tools for improving the communication between the child and the parent as well as getting a better understanding of the child mental and emotional state. All of the above comes in our branded gift packaging.You will be able to completely personalise your child's character by picking the skin, eye and hair colour in addition to the sex.GIRL CHARACTER EXAMPLE:BOY CHARACTER EXAMPLE:PHOTO AND DEDICATION PAGE:PAPER: Mohawk Options 100% PC is an uncoated paper made using wind power, with 100% post-consumer waste.

Cyclus Offset has quality paper properties such as rigidity, stability, opacity, tear strength and foldability. The quality now meets the environment. SUSTAINABILITY AND FINISH: To ensure durability we have applied satin non-scratch finish to the cover of the book and to be sure our product is 100% child-friendly we have rounded the paper edges of the book.

Book with a CAUSE
We have refined and combined all our competitor's strong suit and elevated our product by adding interactive and educational part topped with a great cause and realness - which makes our product unique and innovative.“The little child has no prejudices and accepts differences with curiosity, not fear. The idea that the cloud accompanies the child and transforms him from sad and isolated to a friend that helps you not be lonely is very accurate. When a person has the opportunity in his childhood to find the right words for his differences, emotions and thoughts (that the cloud metaphorically symbolizes) and to befriend it, he becomes accepting of others’ differences and gains better understanding. When you don’t have the words or description for what makes you sad and lonely, this can turn into fear and become anger and hatred towards others who are different.If this little book comes to a child at the right time, it can make the world a cosier and better place, in which differences, emotions and thoughts of others don’t scare them or cause racism and segregation.Parents can use the book to speak with their child about emotions and their meanings. The book presents an opportunity for the child to put their emotions and feelings into words, so as to learn to distinguish and understands them.”  - TOLK Family and Children Psychoanalytic Insititute (B.Banova & V.Banova) Now, Ornella and Wizards of Fables need your help to get this remarkable book in the hands of more children, parents and people struggling with depression, anxiety, loss or bullying. Do you want to help us deliver that reassuring and comforting message?​Unfortunately, publishing a book of this quality, with all educational and interactive materials that come in the various packs, is very expensive. As a terminally-ill cancer patient, Ornella simply doesn’t have the financial means, nor the strength to cover the cost of publishing, printing and distributing. Her team is sacrificing a great deal of their personal time to make sure this book becomes a reality. Yet, without your donations, The Little Cloud that Follows me Around will only remain a dream. A small keepsake one mom leaves her son. Together, however, we can make Ornella’s legacy live forever, and more importantly, help many children who are missing on a great, joyful and carefree childhood, find the sparkle that makes them smile. Thank you! Ornella and Wizards of FablesYOUR HELP MEANS THE WORLD TO US",25.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>In December 2020, I finished an MFA program in 3D Animation and VFX. During this transition period, I was working with a delivery service to pay the bills every afternoon, and writing my science fiction series, Chronicles of a Planet's End, every morning. </p>
<p>On January 15th, at 3:45 pm, as I was coming home, a speeding SUV came up behind me and hit my car while trying to change lanes. Right now, my car isn't drivable and is sitting at a wrecker service. I started a claim with his insurance and spoke to my insurance. It will be a few weeks before I have a car back.</p>
<p>As a result, I currently have no income. I have been working towards migrating to a different income stream, but it will take time. Because of the source of income, I don't qualify for unemployment. In order to survive this transition, I have to ask for outside help. I am aware we are all struggling right now because of the global pandemic, but, if you can assist, it will be appreciated.</p>
<p>I thought it would be great to make this fundraiser tied to the completion of my next book, making my book series the center of this campaign. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Campaign Goals and Financial Breakdown</h3>
<p>With the loss of my car, I am looking at a rather dark next few weeks. </p>

<p><i>What Will Happen During This Time</i></p>
<p>During this time, I will focus on developing other sources of income and finish the sixth book in the Chronicles of a Planet's End. </p>
<p>At the moment, I have almost finished the rough draft of the sixth book. It should be published in March.</p>
<p><i>What are Chronicles of a Planet's End?</i><br/><br/>Chronicles of a Planet's End follows a set of characters as they face the inevitable end of the world across four distinct subseries. It is written under my pen name Elena Sierra and is science fiction with elements of fantasy. I wanted to take a group of individuals facing a radical end and the possibilities of interstellar travel and walk them through an impossible future. It is an adventure told from different perspectives, but it is also looking at bigger issues within the interstellar adventure. How do we create belief? How can people live the exact same future and have a totally different relationship to it? What does family mean? What is friendship or community? What is the danger of the cult or charismatic leader? How do we as people deal with realities that are horrid or simply beyond our comprehension? </p>
<p>It is an adult science fiction book series, even though the first three books of The Alexander Chronicles could be appropriate for a young adult audience. All the books contain some degree of violence, sexuality, and adult language.</p>
<p><a href=""HTTP://www.elenasierra.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">HTTP://www.elenasierra.net</a></p>
<p>The story starts with The Alexander Chronicles.  It is about a family immersed in a tradition of interstellar travel, starting when the children are teenagers, and taking them into adulthood. This series is currently at Book Three.</p>
<p>The story continues with The Belief Chronicles. This is a series told from two perspectives. It is told from the perspective of a woman who becomes the most powerful being on Earth and doesn't really want either the path or the responsibility. It is also told from the perspective of a man whose craving for power is such that he is willing to do whatever it takes to be worshipped, valued, and adored.</p>
<p>The third series is The Celluloid Chronicles, which is set in the world of media. It follows the perspective of people living ordinary lives within Los Angeles that are suddenly faced with a reality beyond the movies. The book I am currently writing is the first of this series. </p>
<p>The fourth series is still under development.</p>
<p>The books can be read by subseries or chronologically. </p>
<p>The Chronological Order is:</p>
<p>The Alexander Chronicles Book One <br/>The Alexander Chronicles Book Two<br/>The Belief Chronicles Book One<br/>The Alexander Chronicles Book Three<br/>The Belief Chronicles Book Two<br/>The Celluloid Chronicles Book One</p>
<p><i>The Gift of Books</i></p>
<p>I will be sending my books as a thank you gift for your help. I am aware it is possible to buy the books for less on Amazon. This isn't so much about selling the books, but rather to thank you for your help during this difficult time. </p>
<p>If you give $100, I will send you the physical book version of all five current books and the sixth book once it is done.</p>
<p>If you give $50, I will send you the physical book versions of The Alexander Chronicles or you can have the six books in Kindle format.</p>
<p>If you give $40, I will send you the physical book versions of The Belief Chronicles.</p>
<p>If you give $30, I will send you the Kindle versions of The Alexander Chronicles.</p>
<p>If you give $20, I will send you the Kindle versions of The Belief Chronicles or anyone physical copy of one of the books.</p>
<p>If you give $10, I will send you any one Kindle copy of one of my books.</p>
<p>I will write a small thank you note in all paperback editions before sending them out. In order not to break the KDP guidelines, I will be buying all the Kindle books and sending them to you as gifts. You will receive an email from Amazon for you to download. It will also be easier this way for you to get them into your Kindle.</p>
<p><i>What happens if more than $3000 is fundraised?</i></p>
<p>I will put any excess money directly into writing more books, kindle advertising and promotions, and expanding the success of this series. I would also love to invest in the future in professional publishing services to increase the distribution and quality of the artwork and the books. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The campaign is both a lifesaver and a support my life long creative endeavor.</p>
<p>For me, writing is my lifeline. It is what makes me wake up in the morning. I want to create an incredible story world that expands beyond novels and really looks at what it means to be human. </p>
<p>That being said, the support of this campaign will also guarantee that I have a roof over my head and food to eat for at least long enough to sort of the mess with the car. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I really appreciate all of your support, and if you can't contribute financially at this time, then I would love it if you would spread the word about the campaign. The campaign is only 17 days long because I need it done with enough time to pay rent. I do appreciate all of your support in this insane endeavor. If you have read my books, reviews on Amazon or Goodreads are always awesome.</p>

<h3>Hey there! </h3>
<p>I'm John G. Hartness, and I write the Bubba the Monster Hunter series of short stories and novellas. Think of it if Ash from The Evil Dead and Larry the Cable Guy had a baby, it would turn out a lot like Bubba. He's a giant redneck from the mountains of Georgia, and he's been hunting monsters and kicking ass since 2012! </p>
<p>I've put out four collections of Bubba Stories - Scattered, Smothered, &amp; Chunked; Grits, Guns, &amp; Glory; Wine, Women, &amp; Song; and Monsters, Magic, &amp; Mayhem. All of these are available in ebook, print, and audiobook. I'm currently in the middle of Season 5, with two of the four novellas released - Born to Be Wild and Swamp Music. They're available in print and ebook format currently. </p>
<p>I've also released a short story collection about Bubba's Great-Grandpappy Beauregard entitled Shinepunk, which is what you get if you mix moonshine, steampunk, monsters, and rednecks. Shinepunk is available in print &amp; ebook. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>So what's this whole thing for? </h3>
<p>We're producing the audiobooks for Shinepunk, Born to Be Wild, and Swamp Music. John Solo, who has narrated Seasons 2-4, is gearing up to start recording soon, and we can't wait to get these into your hands. </p>
<p>That's what this whole thing is for. By pre-ordering the audiobooks through this campaign, you'll get them a whole lot faster than if you wait for normal distribution. After an audiobook is produced, it can take as much as six weeks for it to go through all the computerized rigamarole to get it out there for you to listen to. This way, you get it as soon as we perfect the product (and I don't have to give 60% of the money to the distributor. </p>
<p>Yeah, 60% of the money you spend on an audiobook goes to the distributor. Or 75% in some cases. This way, you support the creator (me) directly, and you get your audiobook faster! </p>
<p>We're making these audiobooks regardless of whether we hit our goal or not. The budget is approved, and the studio time is scheduled. So it's not a question of whether or not they'll get made, it's just a matter of how quickly they get through post-production and become available, and how many awesome Bubba short stories I get to narrate for you! </p>
<p><strong>Wait, what?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, that's right. Everyone who backs the project, at any level, will get a free Bubba the Monster Hunter short story narrated by yours truly. I'm an actor with over three decades of experience, and you can check out the Falstaff Books YouTube channel to see some of my readings from conventions. I'm pretty good, if not very modest. :) </p>
<p>And for every $500 over the goal we get, I'll record another short story to go out to every single backer of the project! These short stories will be available exclusively to our supporters here for six months, then we'll put them on sale other places. But you fine folx get to decide how many we're gonna do, so spread the word and get all your friends to pitch in and get me behind the microphone! </p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>Risks</strong></h3>
<p>There are always risks. We could all get hit by an asteroid tomorrow. But I think with the sheer number of Bubba projects John Solo and I have done together over the years, this one is about as guaranteed as we can make it. I expect the books to be recorded over the course of the Spring, and we'll release them one at a time as they get through quality control. Quality Control's name is Theresa. Some of y'all have met her. She's awesome, and she proofs my audio for me. Like I said, the studio time is booked, and the money is already set aside. These things are getting made, it's just a question of how fast do you want 'em, and how many short stories do you want me to read? </p>
<p><strong>But I'm Broke, how can I help?</strong></p>
<p>Dude, I feel ya. If you can chuck in $2, you'll get any and all short stories just as a way of saying thanks. But if you just want to lend your voice, use the Indiegogo share tools and spread the word on all the social media sites, because the more people hear how awesome it's gonna be, the more awesome it'll be! </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Greetings! My name is Ponce Ferguson. I'm a freelance journalist and language teacher. I also worked as a Language Access Assistant for the Judiciary in the State of Virginia. We've all heard many things about Africa and it's people.  The good the bad, and the ugly, even. For the most part, however, the bad things and the ugly stories are usually what get stuck in our minds. I hope that with this project I can begin to show the positive side of Africa, its people and its culture. ABENA: Princess of Africa is based on true facts. It's the story of several people I encountered on my first trip to Ghana. The story is centered around Abena, a young Ghanaian girl who is committed and devoted in getting out of her small little town, meet her prince charming and make it big in the bigger city. Along the way, she meets interesting people. Men who will stop at nothing to get their way and ""aunties"" who will lend a helping hand and support in her quest. More than anything else, Abena, Princess of Africa, is a love story between a beautiful young lady, and a much older man. The story will bring forth the sensitivity, the sex, the romance and kindness of good hearted  people. This is the side of Africa that is never told, the good side of humanity.</p>
<p>Your contributions will help bring to the forefront the side of Africa that is almost never spoken of. Africa is more that poverty and famine; it's more than corrupt politicians.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>It's very simple. I really want the world to know that there is more that the negativity we hear about Africa. Africans are people. They are human beings who only ask for a chance to show that they are worthy, that they too can contribute to our society as a whole. They are kind hearted people who are willing to share with us whatever little they have. </p>
<p>All i want is for the world to know that we don't have to treat Africa and African as if they were extraterrestrials living on this Earth. There is another beautiful side to Africa. A side of compassionate love, fun and diversity. That's the side that you will help me bring to life in ABENA, Princess of Africa.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>In book writing, as you may know, the only risk is that no one reads your book. But far more concerning, and a big present challenge, is the fact that due to the current pandemic, the Ghanaian borders are closed and it is a bit difficult in trying to get a ticket booked to fly to Ghana, as I need to finish my research. I'm planning to leave for Ghana by mid August, but if the borders are not opened by then, that will set the plans behind. Please keep that in mind. NEVERTHELESS, I intend to use whatever means in order to finish the book</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Greetings! My name is Ponce Ferguson. I'm a freelance journalist and language teacher. I also worked as a Language Access Assistant for the Judiciary in the State of Virginia. We've all heard many things about Africa and it's people.  The good the bad, and the ugly, even. For the most part, however, the bad things and the ugly stories are usually what get stuck in our minds. I hope that with this project I can begin to show the positive side of Africa, its people and its culture. ABENA: Princess of Africa is based on true facts. It's the story of several people I encountered on my first trip to Ghana. The story is centered around Abena, a young Ghanaian girl who is committed and devoted in getting out of her small little town, meet her prince charming and make it big in the bigger city. Along the way, she meets interesting people. Men who will stop at nothing to get their way and ""aunties"" who will lend a helping hand and support in her quest. More than anything else, Abena, Princess of Africa, is a love story between a beautiful young lady, and a much older man. The story will bring forth the sensitivity, the sex, the romance and kindness of good hearted  people. This is the side of Africa that is never told, the good side of humanity.
Your contributions will help bring to the forefront the side of Africa that is almost never spoken of. Africa is more that poverty and famine; it's more than corrupt politicians. Africa, is smiles in times of trouble and adversities. It's caring for one another and above all, Africa is love. Please help me show the world the goodness of a wonderful land and its people.

<h3>#RBG100th</h3>
<p>In commemoration of the 100-year anniversary of the UNIA’s “First International Convention of the Negro Peoples of the World,” a collective of grassroots organizers and Pan Africanist organizations will host the RBG Centennial Conference. The virtual convention’s theme is “Garveyism and the renewed cry for Afrikan Nationhood.” The RBG Centennial Conference will feature 70+ speakers, representing more than 60 organizations from 20 countries. The conference will also feature 50+ workshops, including panel discussions, virtual performances, and vending. Organizers are using #RBG100th to educate and bring attention to the legacy of His Excellency, the Honorable Marcus Mosiah Garvey, and the work of the Universal Negro Improvement Association (U.N.I.A).</p>

<h3>About the Artists</h3>
<p><strong>Ian Tee</strong></p>
<p>Ian Tee’s (b. 1994) practice investigates the social space of abstraction through questioning surfaces and form. Conflating visual language from art history to youth subcultures, he is interested in how aesthetic narratives can be reworked and recontextualised. His work manifests in a variety of media - destroyed metal paintings, bleached and dyed textiles, collage, and modified clothes.</p>
<p>Ian Tee completed his BA Fine Arts at LASALLE College of the Arts, Singapore in 2018. He is a recipient of the Ngee Ann Kongsi scholarship and winner of the 2017 Cliftons Art Prize for Singapore. He is also a contributing writer for Art Republik magazine.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Moses Tan</strong></p>
<p>Moses Tan (b. 1986) is an artist based in Singapore. He is interested in research surrounding queer melancholia, resistance through poetic forms and history. Employing drawing, video, sound and materials, he is interested in creating experiences.</p>
<p>He graduated from LASALLE College of the Arts with a BA (Hons) in Fine Arts and a BA (Hons) in Chemistry and Biological Chemistry from Nanyang Technological University.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>Zarina Muhammad</strong></p>
<p>Zarina Muhammad (b. 1982) is an artist, educator and writer whose practice is deeply entwined with her decade-long multidisciplinary research on the shapeshifting forms and cultural translations pertaining to Southeast Asian ritual magic, sacred sites, forgotten spirits and the tracing of mythological roots of the feared, desired and revered (supernatural) body across the region.</p>
<p>Her series of often collaborative and performance-based works deconstruct and aim to confront histories, texts, definitions, and (mis)representations associated with these bodies of knowledge and polycosmologies. In the various incarnations of her work, she is particularly interested in the broader contexts of myth-making, gender-based archetypes and the region’s tenuous and tentative relationship to mysticism and the immaterial against the dynamics of global modernity.</p>
<p>In 2019, she will begin a research residency at extantation – an experimental performance/art space in Chiang Mai where she intends to look into the ghost/spirit dance traditions in Northern Thailand as part of a broader study on comparative embodied performances in Asia. She has presented her work in Indonesia, Cambodia, Japan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Australia.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Zulkhairi Zulkiflee</strong></p>
<p>Zulkhairi Zulkiflee (b. 1991) is a visual artist, educator, and exhibition-maker based in Singapore. His practice explores the notion of Malayness in relation to knowledge production, social agency and distinction/ taste.</p>
<p>Zulkhairi has exhibited in group exhibitions such as the Young Talent Programme (2017) by the Affordable Art Fair Singapore and ION Art, CICA Contemporary Photography Exhibition Summer 2017 at the CICA Museum, South Korea, as well as Untapped Discovery (presented by Visual Arts Development Association) (2016) at SHOPHOUSE 5, Singapore. His art zine, Pisau &amp; Timun (Knife &amp; Cucumber), has also been acquired by the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC), catalogued under the Joan Flasch Artists’ Book Collection and shown at The New York Art Book Fair (NYABF) 2016, MoMA PS1, New York. Zulkhairi has organised alternative group exhibitions like LUCKY show (2018), RAID (2018), RUANG (2017) and Dancing on the Spot (2016).</p>

This is not another one-for-one model, but rather it is a new approach on creativity, learning, and giving. Our business model is to partner together with local and national charities to make a difference through book publishing. Every season, or as we call it, <i>Benefit Season</i>, will feature a newly released children’s book as well as a new charity to partner with. Each season lasts 3 months. Throughout that season, a portion of the proceeds will be donated to the respective charity. This allows us to not only make an impact in one organization but tens to eventually thousands of charitable organizations. As we grow our reach, our vision is to allow for organizations to apply for fund-raising throughout the Benefit Season to create long-lasting relationships, impact, and offer exclusive giveaway content. Bringing on other writers and illustrators to create a community of world-changing writers is a near-future goal as well.<strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573835325/mgle2doxha13ghcwdjed.png"" src=""""/></strong></p><p>It was the late and great Whitney Houston that once sang, “<i>I believe that children are the future,</i>” and we could not agree more. That is why we have made it our mission to partner with charities that are primarily children-focused. The inspiration for this project stemmed from receiving news that, after 16 months of trying to conceive, my wife and I were finally expecting our first child. What will we teach him or her?

This is not another one-for-one model, but rather it is a new approach on creativity, learning, and giving. Our business model is to partner together with local and national charities to make a difference through book publishing. Every season, or as we call it, Benefit Season, will feature a newly released children’s book as well as a new charity to partner with. Each season lasts 3 months. Throughout that season, a portion of the proceeds will be donated to the respective charity. This allows us to not only make an impact in one organization but tens to eventually thousands of charitable organizations. As we grow our reach, our vision is to allow for organizations to apply for fund-raising throughout the Benefit Season to create long-lasting relationships, impact, and offer exclusive giveaway content. Bringing on other writers and illustrators to create a community of world-changing writers is a near-future goal as well.It was the late and great Whitney Houston that once sang, “I believe that children are the future,” and we could not agree more. That is why we have made it our mission to partner with charities that are primarily children-focused.

Speculated, I say, because it is a lot of guess work on their part, so the stories in OROPE could have happened.  OROPE put the reader/listener there!  The use of story lines which reflected (possible) Mayan/Aztec, Egyptian, Celtic (?) cultures was fascinating and really required that I use different types of approaches to each of the voices needed for the narration.  The author – Guenevere Lee – wrote characters for OROPE who were believable and passionate.  I look forward to the next instalment of the characters’ stories and hope that I can be the voice for it.""</p><p><i>Please check out some of Darla's amazing voice work on her <a href=""https://www.darlasvoice.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a>, or <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Darlas-Voice-246840192020028"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook page</a> (and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/199095733771188"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here too</a>!).</i></p><p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p><p>I am hoping to raise $5,300.

It’s influenced by mythology and ancient cultures. It is set when the Bronze Age is waning. The great kingdoms are beginning to buckle under the weight of civil wars, hedonism, and corruption. Only the Gogepe, the Whisperers of the Gods, see the warnings.In Orope - The White Snake, the Gogepe send out three messengers to the three great kingdoms. They must convince their rulers to honour the old ways, or be destroyed by a great flood.Pekari – The Azure Fish begins where Orope ends. Some of the messengers are closer to finishing their mission than others, but around them the world grows more dangerous.Orope was a runner-up at the 2018 London Book Festival, and Book of the Day (9/15/18) on OnlineBookClub.Org. Read chapter one of Orope here.Watch the video to see:

The TeamLike any great project, I couldn’t have published either novel without a lot of help. I wanted to introduce some of the people who helped me, and share their thoughts about me and Orope.Lara Helmling, Editor""As Guenevere's editor, I have had the remarkable honor of seeing her works come to life on the printed page. I can tell you, as an acquisitions editor I am one of the toughest critics of incoming manuscripts. I can tell you that I recommend Guenevere's books to anyone who loves literature. Guenevere Lee's books, Orope, The White Snake and Pekari, The Azure Fish, are two of the most fascinating and unique works of literature I've encountered. The setting in the Bronze Age comes alive through the eyes of four intriguing characters and their do-or-die mission to save their world. With nature, rulers, and entire communities working against them, their task is not for the faint-hearted, and the reader must wonder if their heroes will ever make it out alive - much less save their world. Her newest book, Pekari, The Azure Fish, is a thoroughly enjoyable read that is exciting and simultaneously soothes the soul on those nights when nothing sounds better than a book and a quiet cup of tea. It is on my list of must-haves for my personal library, and I would highly recommend it for you as well. ""Lara is dedicated to help authors be successful in the publishing world, check out the Bestselling Author Studio, which she runs! You can also find her on Facebook.Sheharzad Arshad, Map Illustrator“Getting to work on the maps for Orope, The White Snake and Pekari, The Azure Fish, was an amazing experience for me because the amount of detail and effort that Guenevere Lee has put into creating the world for her characters made me feel like that these were real places that I could visit. Having the maps alongside while following the journey of the different characters made the story very immersive and much more fun to read. It makes me want to learn more about the characters and their world. You will have a lot of fun diving into this world as you read these amazing novels.”Sherharzad doesn't just do maps, he's an incredibly funny and talented artist. Please take a look at his Art Gallery and Instagram!Darla Middlebrook, Audiobook Narrator and Producer""I really enjoyed working on Guenevere Lee’s novel OROPE because I love ancient history.  This type of writing gives me a grand excuse to research history and linguistics.  That research is something that I enjoy because it keeps the brain cells firing.  (Stamp out those Alzheimer’s symptoms!!)  While I worked on the narration for Ms. Lee’s novel, I researched some of the information that archaeologists and historians have speculated about regarding the Bronze Age. Speculated, I say, because it is a lot of guess work on their part, so the stories in OROPE could have happened.  OROPE put the reader/listener there!  The use of story lines which reflected (possible) Mayan/Aztec, Egyptian, Celtic (?) cultures was fascinating and really required that I use different types of approaches to each of the voices needed for the narration.  The author – Guenevere Lee – wrote characters for OROPE who were believable and passionate.  I look forward to the next instalment of the characters’ stories and hope that I can be the voice for it.""Please check out some of Darla's amazing voice work on her website, or Facebook page (and here too!).What We Need & What You GetI am hoping to raise $5,300. Because publishing today is such a ridiculously competitive market, publishers can't afford to send out hundreds of author copies. I use author copies for events, giveaways, and conventions.For events:
Last year I went to over 20 bookstores around southern Ontario, meeting readers and promoting Orope.
This year I hope to visit stores in other provinces, and even the US. Travel and hotel costs are high, so the more author copies I have the more events I can hold.
For giveaways:
I’ve held multiple giveaways with Amazon, Goodreads, and the Online Book Club. I’ve given hundreds of free copies away to lucky readers. This is crucial in marketing a book from a fairly unknown author.
I intend to give away twice as many copies (because I have twice as many books published now, lol). A lot of these giveaways require me to mail out the copies, the funds raised from this campaign will cut that cost by half because I won’t need to purchase extra copies.
For conventions:
This is the big one! I’ve attended three conventions now, and had more success at each one. It’s the best way to get the word out about my series.
I plan to attend an average of one convention a month this year, and having copies provided by this campaign will allow me to achieve this goal.

<h3>What is #EXTRAOrdinary All About?</h3>
<p>Our book was born just a little over year ago with a frustrated rant about hormones and a hopeful discussion about which essential oils might help us navigate our way through “The Change.”</p>
<p>What do we mean by ""The Change?"" The dreaded ""personal summers.” A tiredness that comes from the very marrow of our bones. People looking right through us (or worse, talking <i>about</i> us) as if we aren’t <i>sitting.right.there.in.front.of.them.</i> The knowledge that we are no longer part of the younger generation so revered by the media and society in general. Sitting on the edge of the bed for a few extra minutes in the morning because everything hurts. Losing pieces of ourselves but not having time to find them because we have to take care of everyone else first. Yep—we're talking about aging, the troll that shoves our girlhoods aside like a bully taking cuts in the lunch line _on turkey gravy day_.</p>
<p>Our ""we're mad as h*ll and aren't going to take it anymore"" rant evolved into an exciting mission to write a book that would help Women in the Middle, like us, navigate the waves that come with this stage of life. What we realized is that while we’re all <i>ordinary</i>—meaning, we all have these collective, universal experiences—we are also all #EXTRA. This book is a tool for us all to reclaim our #EXTRA, remember who we are, and shout it out to the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
<p>We are Lisa and Carleen—BFFs who share a brain and totally GET you. (Oh, sister, we TOTALLY get you…)</p>
<p>Our debut book is one part stories, one part self-help, and one part personal journal, all made with the collective journey of Women in the Middle in mind. The central structure of the text is based on a metaphor for life from Carleen's older brother, Cedric, who passed away when she was fifteen: Life is like water skiing, and there are four rules to keep in mind:</p>
<p><strong>1. Don’t panic.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. If you fall, fall gracefully.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. When you fall, let go of the rope.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Get up and try again.</strong></p>
<p>Each section starts with a letter to our readers, followed by stories from each of us, a series of helpful strategies to try, and space for readers to add to the collective Women in the Middle narrative. While it has a spirited tone, it also addresses serious topics such as loss, anxiety, and relationships. #EXTRAOrdinary is honest and authentic at its core, and its mission is remind women that they are loved and they matter—just the way they are.</p>
<p>With the help of a fantastic, local, women-owned publishing company, we have been fortunate to be able to organize, develop, and write the entire manuscript with very little coaching, design the cover, and co-create the interior aesthetic. We have a thriving social media presence and plans for several more projects—#EXTRAOrdinary is just the beginning!</p>
<p>The book is beautifully done in full color, featuring many personal photos, a Midcentury aesthetic (a loving tribute to our spunky mothers, aunts, grandmas, and neighbor ladies, all of whom were/are also both ORDINARY and #EXTRA), and WHOLE LOT of pixie dust.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>So . . . What Are People Saying About <i>#EXTRAOrdinary</i>?</h3>
<p>""MN Nice"" makes it hard to toot your own horn (and ask for moola!), but here are a couple of nice reviews we've gotten:</p>
<p>""In an Insta World that sometimes makes us feel like there aren't enough filters in the day, Lisa and Carleen remind us that we aren't alone. Using a brilliant waterskiing analogy passed down from Carleen's big brother Cedric, these ladies remind us that we can fall gracefully, that sometimes we need to let go, and that always, at the end of the day, it's possible to grab that rope and give 'er another go. Weaving their life stories with doable steps to try when life hands you a face-full of lake water, Lisa and Carleen encourage finding your own voice, telling your own story (even if it's just quietly in your mind), and driving the boat full speed ahead into your own #EXTRAOrdinary!""</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><strong>—Michelle Shaffner</strong></p>
<p><br/>""Through a series of deeply personal essays, Carleen and Lisa share their stories of mistakes and failures, loss, and deep pain, and how through perseverance, therapy, and the support of family and friends they are finding their way to healing, self-love, and joy.</p>
<p>Through writing prompts and self-care strategies, they invite us to share our stories and follow our intuition into practices that will gently guide us towards wholeness and help us find that special spark, that passion, that something #EXTRA, that's in all of us. Though it's written specifically for Waterskiing Women of a Certain Season, #EXTRAOrdinary is full of wisdom and encouragement for people of all genders and ages.""</p>

<h3>Perks </h3>
<p>Ok, now let us be perfectly clear: We are not just asking you to donate to the publishing costs of our book. We've got perks for you, because OF COURSE we do!</p>
<p><strong>One of our Perks is a signed copy of the book</strong> (because OBviously, you need one).</p>
<p>Guess what? <strong>We also have FRIENDSHIP PINS!</strong> You remember those, right? YAAAASSSSS. We GenXers wore them all over our rad tennis shoes when we were young teens in the early ‘80s. Each pin was unique to the person who made it, and they became symbols of friendship and inclusiveness. Pins can be put on lanyards, backpacks, shoelaces—wherever!</p>
<p>Both of us felt strongly that it was time to bring these pins back as we all need friendship, inclusiveness, and sisterhood now more than ever. We need to come together more than ever, and we need to feel part of a team more than ever. We want to get pins in the hands of as many people as we can to remind them that they are loved, just as they are!</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>at the top end of the Perks is a bit o'bling </strong>to make your world more beautiful. The two of us create beautiful, unique ""necklaces"" that are designed NOT FOR PEOPLE but for mason jars, salt lamps, essential oil diffusers, or even figurines! </p>
<p>To make our #EXTRAOrdinary pieces, we hand-select a variety of beads and charms, including up-cycled vintage beads, lava beads, semi-precious stones, and a variety of glass, metal, and wooden beads. Some are more simple, and some are ornate. Some are bright and boisterous, and some are more natural and subdued. Every piece is one-of-a-kind. Like them, every one of our sisters is unique and beautiful, just as she is. </p>

<h3>This Campaign is to bring Ajji and Mili Children's Book  to reality:</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1538528326/flq0buprie7l9zkht4sl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>What Is this Campaign all about :</strong></p>
<p>A connection to <strong>Nature</strong> is very important and the best way to have environmentally aware adults is to have children who are connected to nature. I have written and illustrated this book Ajji and Mili - Into The Forest as a way of introducing children to nature through stories and a bit of magic.</p>
<p>I also realised that there were not many children's books set in my native Karnataka in India, so want to bring in the local culture and relatable characters through this book.</p>
<p>If Fully funded I will be <strong>Donating 200 Books</strong> to School Libraries.</p>

<p><strong>A Little About Me:</strong></p>
<p>I am an artist, illustrator and writer. I have a degree in art history and fell in love with watercolours a long time ago when I first saw Beatrix Potter's books. I grew up reading Alexander Afanasyev's fairy tales and folk tales illustrated by Ivan Bilibin.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1538530391/tyksckz66r22uosj1g8i.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The love for illustrations started then and has never faded and has led me to believe that illustrated Children's books can help develop a child's imagination, cognition, memory and more.</p>
<p>The reason I started writing Ajji and Mili<a href=""https://ajjiandmili.home.blog/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> </a>was because I grew up listening to my Grandmothers stories, one story led to another and another. Ajji means Grandmother in my Mother tongue Kannada.</p>
<p>I always loved nature but got more involved with environmental issues about 5 years ago and came to realize that the best way to conserve nature is to have the next generation be more aware and prone to conservation. For this to happen children need to be made aware. This book tries to do that with stories and with adventure, with magic and fun. This way children can find it entertaining and engaging as well as find a way of connecting to nature through stories and images.</p>
<p>I have been working with children taking art workshops for a few years now and have also taken many art workshops that help children connect with nature.</p>

</div><p>Thank You</p><p>For all the love and support</p></div>","This Campaign is to bring Ajji and Mili Children's Book  to reality:

What Is this Campaign all about :
A connection to Nature is very important and the best way to have environmentally aware adults is to have children who are connected to nature. I have written and illustrated this book Ajji and Mili - Into The Forest as a way of introducing children to nature through stories and a bit of magic.
I also realised that there were not many children's books set in my native Karnataka in India, so want to bring in the local culture and relatable characters through this book.
If Fully funded I will be Donating 200 Books to School Libraries.

A Little About Me:
I am an artist, illustrator and writer. I have a degree in art history and fell in love with watercolours a long time ago when I first saw Beatrix Potter's books. I grew up reading Alexander Afanasyev's fairy tales and folk tales illustrated by Ivan Bilibin.

The love for illustrations started then and has never faded and has led me to believe that illustrated Children's books can help develop a child's imagination, cognition, memory and more.
The reason I started writing Ajji and Mili was because I grew up listening to my Grandmothers stories, one story led to another and another. Ajji means Grandmother in my Mother tongue Kannada.
I always loved nature but got more involved with environmental issues about 5 years ago and came to realize that the best way to conserve nature is to have the next generation be more aware and prone to conservation. For this to happen children need to be made aware. This book tries to do that with stories and with adventure, with magic and fun. This way children can find it entertaining and engaging as well as find a way of connecting to nature through stories and images.
I have been working with children taking art workshops for a few years now and have also taken many art workshops that help children connect with nature.



 
About the book : Ajji and Mili - Into the Forest
Ajji and Mili into the forest is the story of the adventures of Ajji and her granddaughter Mili who have to cross the Forest, where they meet Tako a funny , quirky fox as they walk through the forest, follow the river, climb up the mountain, meet a world traveling seed collecting Beaver and come across so many different plants and animals, trees and birds.
I decided on self publishing for many reasons, I wanted to be the one to write it and also illustrate it. Having had experience in writing for over a decade and illustrating and design experience for half a decade I am quite confident on putting the best foot forward.

The amount needed to bring this to life is 11,000 USD. This will help in the editing, proof reading and printing of the book. It will also aid in the creation of the colouring book and activity books that are to follow. It will aid in packing and shipping all the books and keeping an inventory.
There are loads of perks to choose from -Archival quality Art Prints of my original Watercolour illustrations, Stickers , Badges and Bookmarks with watercolour illustrations, Colouring book, Slipcase Gift Edition with Autographed books with spot laminated hardback covers and Limited Edition Gift Sets with some awesome goodies.

<p><strong>Why is this campaign and its goal important to me and the world?</strong></p>
<p>I wanted to write this book to inspire a discussion of what we think are up to. Who are we and what are we doing?</p>
<p>This epic story has been on my mind for a very long time, yet in its present form it came to me suddenly over breakfast by the local river.</p>
<p>After that followed several years of my total reclusive  absorption in this manuscript.</p>
<p>Now it would make me tremendously happy to be able to make this book available for the public, and for that I ask for your contribution and support. This campaign, which will run on Indiegogo, Facebook, and Instagram, has as its goal to raise funds for a professional edit, proofreading, formatting as e-book and print ready PDF, as well as publishing on platforms like Amazon.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>My budget covers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Editing</strong></li>
<li><strong>Proof-reading</strong></li>
<li><strong>Formatting as e-book</strong></li>
<li><strong>Print ready PDF</strong></li>
<li><strong>Design</strong></li>
<li><strong>Publishing as an e-book</strong></li>
<li><strong>Listings on e-book platforms like Amazon.</strong></li>
<li><strong><u>Total cost app: 5000 US$/ 4450 Euro/ 33000 danish kroner</u></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul></ul>
<p><strong>What in it for you?</strong> Well first of all the joy of bringing a book  with true depth to life. Also have a look at the many different perks for donating: You can get listed as backer in the book, have a part of the manuscript with notes, get a front cover print, get the book or even have dinner with the author!</p>
<p><strong>What if I don’t reach my goal? </strong> Then I will go ahead with the project in a slower pace, and probably make one more campaign later.</p>
<p><b>What if I get more than my goal? </b>No problem :-) I'll use it for printing paper copies and PR.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>In supporting the publication, you support the message of unity and a story that shows our common humanness and the possibility for understanding. A message that I believe is needed in a world obsessed with borders, walls, and separation. Your support will be for something much larger than the budget is able explain and it might give me the chance to write the books I have in mind.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>I have been published in many forms before, but this is my debut novel.<br/>As I self publish in e-format and have a good team to help me, the risks are minimal. Since the book is finished, and the English and Danish manuscripts has been read, basic edited and praised by a handful of discerning readers it is very close to completion.. There is a small risk of a delay though, if less that sufficient funds are raised. If this happens, I will launch a second campaign on a different platform. The goal after self-publishing is to find a publisher in both languages.</p>
<p><strong>What else can I do to help?</strong></p>

This epic story has been on my mind for a very long time, yet in its present form it came to me suddenly over breakfast by the local river.
After that followed several years of my total reclusive  absorption in this manuscript.
Now it would make me tremendously happy to be able to make this book available for the public, and for that I ask for your contribution and support. This campaign, which will run on Indiegogo, Facebook, and Instagram, has as its goal to raise funds for a professional edit, proofreading, formatting as e-book and print ready PDF, as well as publishing on platforms like Amazon.
Read  an excerpt of the book 

 
 
 

What We Need & What You Get
My budget covers:

Editing
Proof-reading
Formatting as e-book
Print ready PDF
Design
Publishing as an e-book
Listings on e-book platforms like Amazon.
Total cost app: 5000 US$/ 4450 Euro/ 33000 danish kroner


What in it for you? Well first of all the joy of bringing a book  with true depth to life. Also have a look at the many different perks for donating: You can get listed as backer in the book, have a part of the manuscript with notes, get a front cover print, get the book or even have dinner with the author!
What if I don’t reach my goal?  Then I will go ahead with the project in a slower pace, and probably make one more campaign later.
What if I get more than my goal? No problem :-) I'll use it for printing paper copies and PR.
The Impact
In supporting the publication, you support the message of unity and a story that shows our common humanness and the possibility for understanding. A message that I believe is needed in a world obsessed with borders, walls, and separation. Your support will be for something much larger than the budget is able explain and it might give me the chance to write the books I have in mind.
Risks & Challenges
I have been published in many forms before, but this is my debut novel.As I self publish in e-format and have a good team to help me, the risks are minimal. Since the book is finished, and the English and Danish manuscripts has been read, basic edited and praised by a handful of discerning readers it is very close to completion.. There is a small risk of a delay though, if less that sufficient funds are raised. If this happens, I will launch a second campaign on a different platform. The goal after self-publishing is to find a publisher in both languages.
What else can I do to help?

You can easily spread the word about this campaign by using Indiegogo sharing tool.

<h3>The Long-Awaited One</h3>
<p>This 30 day devotional and Bible reading plan grew from a reading plan I developed for my children during the Advent season.  As a homeschool mom, I decided to create a list of scriptures to bring deeper meaning to our Christmas celebration.  So, I chose scriptures that prophesied the coming of the Messiah throughout the Old Testament and culminated in the reading of the Christmas story together as a family during the week of Christmas.</p>
<p>We loved the study!  Each day, the kids would open their Advent calendar and they would get some candy and a Bible reading for the day.  It truly did add deeper meaning to the season.  After a few years of using the plan, I began to share the reading plan with other families.  Everyone really enjoyed it.  So now I've taken the plan, reorganized it, and written daily devotionals to add to the experience.  We've also been working on some Christmas music to go along with the study.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>We need your help</h3>
<p>By getting behind this campaign, you will help us cover the many costs involved in publishing a book and recording the Christmas music.  Everyone who helps us out will get a copy of the book and the Christmas music.  Our prayer is that the study will truly bring deeper meaning and beauty to your Christmas.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Christmas - the coming of the Messiah</h3>
<p>This study chronicles the prophecies of the Messiah and demonstrates how Jesus fulfilled these prophecies. The music highlights themes pulled from these scriptures and also includes some traditional Christmas favorites.</p>
<p>This will be my sixth studio music project and my first book.  The process has been a lot of fun and a great challenge as I put the study into a book format. I've thoroughly enjoyed researching and writing and I can't wait to get back in the studio.  We plan to work with Bobby Gentilo at Right Coast Recording Studio in Columbia, PA.  Bobby has done a fabulous job on my last two recording projects and it's always a pleasure to work with him.</p>
<p>We truly believe this study will be an encouragement to you and your family.  Thank you for reading, listening, and supporting us.  And if you can't support us financially right now, please pray for us throughout the process of editing, formatting and creating the resource tools, and as we head to the studio.  </p>

<p><strong>To the readers of the On Lyme blog*</strong></p>
<p>This campaign is meant to fund the creation and publication of a new e-book called ‘A Matter of Dignity’. The main theme of this book is the tension between choices made in the governance of modern healthcare and our most fundamental human right: the right to dignity. Both ME and Lyme disease are used as cases to learn from. </p>
<p>In the text below you can read more about the book, its aim, audiences and how to get it.</p>
<p><strong>Takeaways</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A practical-ethical angle on moral issues around disputed diseases such as Lyme disease and ME</li>
<li>Get the 200 page e-book with existing and new interviews (see the names in the FAQ section)</li>
<li>Containing eye-opening medical and historical information about Lyme and ME, provided by credible experts</li>
<li>Aimed to address broader concerns about the quality of global healthcare and its social implications</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Aim</strong></p>
<p>My aim is to publish the most important <strong><a href=""https://on-lyme.org/en/sufferers/lyme-stories"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">On Lyme interviews</a></strong> as a book. They have been read online by 500,000 people across the globe. The selected interviews will be framed within a narrative leading the reader to practical-ethical questions. By showing why these caretakers, doctors, scientists and legal professionals were interviewed over time, it enables the reader to discover the almost unimaginable social consequences of choices made in global healthcare.</p>
<p>New interviews with professionals taking a stand for the human rights of people with an ME diagnosis will be included in the book. From an ethical and social point of view, both Lyme and ME patient groups suffer the same fate. </p>
<p>It’s been an honour to have worked with these medical, scientific and legal professionals in this arena for the past decade. I deeply believe they deserve a wider stage on which they can be heard. They are the giants on whose shoulders others should stand on, working towards real solutions and proper governance with ethics and human rights at its core. </p>
<p>A book is a fitting way to do that. A book has more impact than online articles as it connects the different dots of a complex topic, making the whole more than the sum of its parts. A book can also be referenced by scholars, scientists and journalists. ‘A Matter of Dignity’ will include working links to hundreds of scientific PubMed articles.</p>
<p><strong>Essence</strong></p>
<p>‘A Matter of Dignity’ essentially documents unsettling questions asked by these experts. Is there a tendency to change definitions of diseases? To hide the actual numbers affected? To create international medical guidelines based on ‘evidence-biased’ science? To use inadequate diagnostic tests, while blocking the development of better ones? Is there an increasing tendency to profit from diseases while appointing blame onto those affected? The book shows clear examples of how this has led to devastating social, legal and financial consequences situation for countless people in many countries across the globe.  </p>
<p>In short, 'A Matter of Dignity' tells a story about indignity that will lead to indignation. The book will make the readers question the reliability of statistics, guidelines, priorities and public health information. It will also lead to urgent questions about governance and international treaties. What is the Helsinki Treaty on 'informed consent' worth without complete information? How can doctors now uphold their Hippocratic oath and their promise to first do no harm?</p>
<p><strong>Audiences</strong></p>
<p>If you are a patient with disputed diagnoses like ME or chronic Lyme disease - or a professional treating them - you will recognise the sheer unbelievable dynamics all too well from your own experience. The book will provide you with understandable information, told by credible and brave health professionals, to help you to better understand the situation you are in. Specifically to the who have already read the On Lyme interviews and know what explosive information they contain, this will be valuable to own.</p>
<p>The book may also be eye-opening to those who are actively working to create solutions for other patient groups such as Parkinson, Alzheimer, ALS / MND, Fibromyalgia or MS. The book will show that the current methods used to diagnose these groups are lacking in fundamental information. There are underlying, difficult-to-detect infections implicated in these neurological diseases, but a belief in, and reliance on, flawed testing for infections, embedded in medical practice and education, has led to a false belief that the origin of the diseases is non-microbial. Appropriate treatment is therefore not initiated.</p>
<p>The book is however primarily meant to open the eyes of those working in the healthcare system or those who operate at a policy level of all interconnecting systems: medicine, science, laboratories, psychiatry, psychology, insurances, child protection services and other government entities. The leading ethical questions and information provided by credible professionals may open the eyes of many people, who are in a position to change the narrative and choices made in global healthcare.*</p>
<p><strong>Context</strong></p>
<p>The On Lyme interviews with both patients and caretakers as well as with renowned doctors, psychiatrists, scientists and lawyers from different countries have been available as online articles for years. They have attracted the attention of Amnesty, Human Rights Watch and Children's Health Defense. </p>
<p>The interviews are referenced in scientific articles and were also used as input for two reports to the World Health Organisation and the United Nations. The reports addressed the worldwide human rights violations of Lyme disease patients, parents, doctors and scientists. </p>
<p>After my 2018 meeting with the second Special Rapporteur to the United Nations, the On Lyme Foundation ceased to exist as a non-profit entity due to lack of funding. Soon the interviews will no longer be available online, as the On Lyme website will be taken down. </p>
<p><strong>Request</strong></p>
<p>My request to you is to help to create this book. To join in to preserve this historical information and to spread awareness for the future. </p>
<p>In times of increasing public scrutiny on how our health system is operating and who benefits from it, awareness is key to opening the eyes of many. </p>
<p>You can do so by pre-ordering ‘A Matter of Dignity’. In the ‘perks’ section on this page you can find different options to do so. </p>
<p><strong>Funding goal</strong></p>
<p>When this campaign has reached its funding goal, I will be able to commit my time to create this book as a priority. If the campaign is successful, copies will be send to newspapers, government institutions and medical universities. </p>
<p>If the goal is not fully met, I still intend to produce the book, although at a slower pace as I will need to focus on other sources of income.</p>

<p><strong><i>Welcome to The Outer Dark on This Is Horror. I’m your host Scott Nicolay bringing you news and interviews with the creative talents who operate far beyond the edge of the firelight. There Are Weird Things Out Here, My Friends…</i></strong></p>
<p>When we conceived <a href=""http://theouterdark.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>The Outer Dark</strong> <strong>podcast</strong></a> in 2015, we never expected it to take off like it has and to mean so much to listeners. As the tendrils of the Weird spread further into speculative fiction, film, and TV, people kept asking me and Anya when we were going to do something more hands-on. Thus was born T<strong>he Outer Dark Symposium on the Greater Weird</strong>.</p>
<p>At the inaugural <strong>The Outer Dark Symposium </strong>in 2017, we were humbled to assemble a blockbuster line-up of contemporary Weird writers, including members of the State of Black Science Fiction community. In 2018, we took the symposium West and dreamed bigger and spookier with the Winchester Mystery House, and in 2019, we brought it back to Atlanta to <strong>Silver Scream FX Lab</strong>, a location that’s all about the love of Weird monsters.</p>
<p>For the past three years, the symposium has been a labor of Weird love, only made possible through a combination of memberships, sponsorships, donations, and crowdsourcing. Our hope always has always been to simply break even and make this an annual event.</p>
<p><strong><i>It takes a Weird Village to make Something Weird Happen.</i></strong></p>
<p>THE OUTER DARK SYMPOSIUM happens because YOU supported us, allowing us to share these important conversations with YOU and the Whole Weird World on our host network <a href=""https://www.thisishorror.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>This Is Horror</strong></a>. If you haven’t checked it out, you can find programming from all three past symposia, as well as interviews with our guests and other groundbreaking Weird Renaissance authors <i>on <a href=""http://theouterdark.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>The Outer Dark podcast</strong></a></i>. </p>
<p>This year we’re thrilled to welcome our largest line-up yet, more than 50 of the most dynamic authors, editors, artists, publishers, and scholars in Weird fiction today. Yet our goal remains to keep the symposium immersive, intimate, and budget-responsible. Everyone attends all panels and readings and shares breakfast, lunch and dinner, as well as welcome and author signing receptions and social activities to continue the conversation into the night. While keeping the same feasible model that worked well for the previous two symposiums, this year we raised our attendance to 100 memberships so more people can participate, plus we  added an <strong>Educators Day</strong> on Friday including the inaugural <strong>Teaching Diversity in Weird and Speculative Fiction Roundtable</strong>, with a Friday-only deeply discounted ticket for educators and students.</p>
<p>We couldn’t assemble such an amazing line-up of program participants without waiving ticket fees and providing air and lodging support (approx. $7,000 or more than half our budget) to guests who needed support to participate, as well as covering meals, lodging, and gas for our hardworking volunteers. Other expenses include space rental, catering, audio equipment, badge printing/laminating, printing the program chapbook (offered to supporting members via this campaign), and other basic event expenses adding up to a total budget of about $13,500, even with every tactic of frugality that we can muster. By our calculations, calculating purchased memberships, sponsors and a few patrons that we have now, we need about $4,000 to break even. If by any unlikely chance, we do make any more than we need, that money will go straight back into seeding next year's symposium.</p>
<p><strong><i>Therefore we are humbly reaching out to you again. Through this Indiegogo campaign, you can both help sustain The Outer Dark Symposium and receive cool rewards. </i></strong></p>
<p>ALL supporters receive a The Outer Dark sticker and ALL $20 and up perks include a bonus ebook of For Mortal Things Unsung, Pseudopod's 10th anniversary anthology featuring stories by Orrin Grey, Damien Angelica Walters, Livia Llewellyn, Joe R. Lansdale &amp; many more (a big thanks to Alex and Melissa Hofelich!). And every donation comes with the peace of mind that you helped make something Weird happen!</p>

<p>D-Day: The date on which nearly 160,000 Allied troops stormed the fields and beaches of Normandy to start the liberation of Western Europe. <strong>The seaborne assault was preceded by 13,000 airborne troops who parachuted in or came by glider in the dead of night.</strong> The formidable Douglas C-47 Skytrain (Dakota) led the airborne assault, made up of more than 800 aircraft. As many as 4,413 Allied troops died on the day of the invasion. By the end of D-Day, the Allies had established a foothold in France. Within 11 months, Nazi Germany was defeated.  </p>
<p><strong>On June 5, 2019, 21 C-47 Dakota aircraft departed Duxford, England setting course for Normandy to commemorate the D-Day invasion. </strong>WWII fighters and 'photo ship' aircraft brought the cross-channel armada numbers up to 30. In France, thousands gathered to watch a spectacular recreation of the airdrop that took place over Normandy on D-Day. <strong>Together, 10 C-47 Dakotas carried close to 200 men and women who made the jump near Sannerville, France into Drop Zone K. </strong>Those who jumped were equipped with uniforms and parachutes styled after 1944 Allied paratroopers, lending authenticity to the event.  </p>

<h3>About Us + Our Project</h3>
<p>We (Kate Bebo and Micky Cohrs) are sisters embarking on our first journey into children's book self-publishing.  Every weekend, we get together with our family for dinner and spin fantastical stories about our dogs and the hijinks they would get into if they had more thumbs and fewer human-imposed restrictions.</p>
<p>Micky is an artist and will be illustrating the book.  Kate is a Registered Nurse with an affinity for writing and storytelling.  Our first book, ""Tilly the Weregirl"" is all about Tilly, a beagle based on Kate's dog, and her best human friend, Elle.  They do everything together, but there are some challenges due to Tilly's dogness.  After a visit from a unique and furry fairy, their lives are changed forever under the full moon when all of Tilly and Elle's wildest dreams come true.</p>
<p>Though we probably won't be meeting a mystical creature any time soon, we do believe our dreams will come true too by publishing this story that is so important to us.  We have been telling ourselves this story for years, and now it's time to share Tilly with the world.</p>
<p>With self-publishing, we are in full creative and financial control of our project.  This gives us a lot of peace of mind knowing that a publisher won't attempt to override our vision for our book.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need + What You Get</h3>
<p>Self-publishing is very expensive!  Our goal of $2,000 will allow us to afford:</p>
<p>- Professional editing<br/>- Copyrights<br/>- International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs)<br/>- Children's book template software<br/>- Registration with our self-publishing company<br/>- Marketing services</p>
<p>By contributing to our campaign, you can pre-order our book, either in paperback or hardcover, get a set of cute ""Weregirl"" character stickers or a bundle of both.  Stickers will be available right away but the book will be ready and going to print in early 2022.</p>
<p>Let's say we don't meet our funding goal.  That's ok!  The beauty of Indigogo is that we get to keep any funding we get, even if we don't meet the full goal so we can use any support we get to make it happen and you still get the product you paid for!  Being fully funded would simply mean that the production process would be quicker and you would get your pre-orders sooner.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks + Challenges</h3>
<p>The only risk would be not completely funding our campaign and in that case, the only challenge being self-funding the rest of the project.</p>
<p>We would be able to do it over time, but it would certainly be a challenge.  With time, we would be able to find the funds necessary.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Aside from contributing to our campaign, there are some other ways that you can support us:</p>
<p>- Share our Indiegogo campaign on social media<br/>- Visit our Instagram (@tillytheweregirl), engage, and share our content!<br/>- Visit our website (tillytheweregirl.com)</p>

Micky is an artist and will be illustrating the book.  Kate is a Registered Nurse with an affinity for writing and storytelling.  Our first book, ""Tilly the Weregirl"" is all about Tilly, a beagle based on Kate's dog, and her best human friend, Elle.  They do everything together, but there are some challenges due to Tilly's dogness.  After a visit from a unique and furry fairy, their lives are changed forever under the full moon when all of Tilly and Elle's wildest dreams come true.
Though we probably won't be meeting a mystical creature any time soon, we do believe our dreams will come true too by publishing this story that is so important to us.  We have been telling ourselves this story for years, and now it's time to share Tilly with the world.
With self-publishing, we are in full creative and financial control of our project.  This gives us a lot of peace of mind knowing that a publisher won't attempt to override our vision for our book.

What We Need + What You Get
Self-publishing is very expensive!  Our goal of $2,000 will allow us to afford:
- Professional editing- Copyrights- International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs)- Children's book template software- Registration with our self-publishing company- Marketing services
By contributing to our campaign, you can pre-order our book, either in paperback or hardcover, get a set of cute ""Weregirl"" character stickers or a bundle of both.  Stickers will be available right away but the book will be ready and going to print in early 2022.
Let's say we don't meet our funding goal.  That's ok!  The beauty of Indigogo is that we get to keep any funding we get, even if we don't meet the full goal so we can use any support we get to make it happen and you still get the product you paid for!  Being fully funded would simply mean that the production process would be quicker and you would get your pre-orders sooner.

Risks + Challenges
The only risk would be not completely funding our campaign and in that case, the only challenge being self-funding the rest of the project.
We would be able to do it over time, but it would certainly be a challenge.  With time, we would be able to find the funds necessary.

<p><b>What Do We Need?</b></p>
<p>Our initial goal of $15,000 will help fund the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A professionally printed and handsome hardback edition of the book</li>
<li>A solid, beautiful soft cover edition</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;""> T shirts with graphics from the book</span></li>

The book is pure entertainment, yet is loaded with moral values. In fact, this project is designed to inspire leadership and emotional intelligence in young readers.  That is why your contribution is valuable and much appreciated. Lastly, by crowd funding, you are empowering authorship outside of traditional publishing houses and media outlets so that storytellers like myself can focus on our craft.</p>

I have been writing stories & poetry since my high school years. The frailty of humanity inspires me the most. My passion led me to film school so I could turn my stories into motion pictures. Since graduation, I have written three books - one narrated with original music - along with creating other multi-media projects.  Adventures in Vangoland: The Rise against Evil is the project nearest to my heart. Inspiring Young Readers to Become LeadersThis project has its roots in the shock and anger I felt after the 911 attack. Like many,  I was left  asking God questions about evil in the world.  Years later, as I studied Executive Leadership and Human Services for my Masters Degree, I learned methods of developing resilience and emotional intelligence along with community building and effective leadership. What better way to empower our youth than to incorporate these principles in storytelling?Adventures in Vangoland: The Rise against Evil was born. It addresses how we can be leaders and overcome evil. Through the story in all its manifestations, we can inspire readers to become leaders who walk in love.  The StoryManhattan, a loner and an aspiring young writer from Brooklyn, travels to the historic Tsodilo Hills in Botswana. When a cave adorned with prehistoric paintings mysteriously transports him into a land in peril– Vangoland - he finds himself facing doom in an animal kingdom.In Vangoland, the purity of the King’s heart is critical to survival. His blood must anoint the next king. The animals in his kingdom rely on his relationship with the Creator to prosper their surroundings. Until now.Manhattan encounters a selfish and stubborn King. The land is dry and water is retreating into the underground abyss. Manhattan is their greatest hope to persuade the king.Meanwhile, Beelz, the power hungry evil serpent, will stop at nothing to take over Vangoland. He lures a vulnerable young hare, from the animal kingdom away his community and into his snares. He plots his crushing strategy from Mount Fear with his deadly dragon sidekick.Angelix, the spirit-led dove can help Manhattan get home – but she won’t until evil is defeated. Self-sacrificing, Manhattan climbs Mount Fear for his greatest challenge ever. The fierce battle will decide his fate and the future of Vangoland.
First Goal: The Book 

The book is written, the proof is in - 455 pages, 38 chapters of adventure. The story is set in a fictional kingdom inspired by the real Okavango Delta. This is a breathtaking and pristine region in the Southern African country of Botswana. 


The book is ready to print and has been adapted into a screenplay for movie production. Not only that, I'm working with David Graves, President and Partner of Mirage Entertainment along with architects, engineers, and the tourism board of my native country, Botswana, to build a theme park based on the story. It's exciting how technology is opening new frontiers for creating and sharing. 




What Do We Need?
Our initial goal of $15,000 will help fund the following:

A professionally printed and handsome hardback edition of the book
A solid, beautiful soft cover edition
 T shirts with graphics from the book
Recording songs and poems with drum ensemble
Marketing

These will be distribute at local bookstores, book fairs, and community events.

What do you get?
 Depending on your pledge you will receive a copy of the book in multiple formats. Your name can even appear in the next book. Depending on the type of a perk, you will receive a publication credit on our website on the book's page. You will become the family of the trilogy.
The Impact You Will Make
Without you, this project will not be printed and distributed, but this process is an important first step in the transmedia development. The book is pure entertainment, yet is loaded with moral values. In fact, this project is designed to inspire leadership and emotional intelligence in young readers.  That is why your contribution is valuable and much appreciated. Lastly, by crowd funding, you are empowering authorship outside of traditional publishing houses and media outlets so that storytellers like myself can focus on our craft.



STRETCH GOALS: The Movie and Theme Park 
Beyond our initial goal, we will begin  preparing the feasibility studies for the theme park and break down the screenplay to begin developing the movie.

I am a member of the media and film society Lambda Kappa Tau, Alpha Chapter. I have served as an Assistant Director, for Independent film projects Waging War; Z Is For Zebra, The 48 Hour Film Competition and Bait & Switch.  My Co-Writing credits include the Independent film Waging War, and Bait & Switch, as well, the Lambda Kappa Tau 48 hour film, Levels. I think an ability to understand and connect with fictional characters can teach us to emphasize and grow with people in the real world.See more on our website...https://www.facebook.com/JoMarkCreative?ref=aymt_homepage_panelThis campaign to bring the book Noteworthy Tribute to print, is important because we have this enormous opportunity to share about people coming-of-age. Finally, we are nearing the finish line and about to see our ""baby"" born. You'll be helping us respond to the numerous requests we've already received for this book.Early Praise!""I thought it was an easy read and easy to follow.

If we do not reach our entire funding goal we intend to adjust where we can i.e. perks, and with reduced expectations i.e. high costs of editing, marketing, shipping. The ImpactWe believe strongly in the importance of generational relationships. This project is an opportunity for us to further demonstrate that belief. We are the message! We have already found that others have noticed the ""footprint"" that we are making and they are encouraging us to ""walk"" this path further.
The story is initiated by the relationship between family members and grows to include others. We use story to show how relationships can progress beyond boundaries.
This project itself is a father and son(s) project; think about it, we actually wrote a novel together.
The musical group, The Mustangz, (in the story and our actual ""family"" band) includes various generations.
This is not only a coming-of-age story for young adults but also for their parents.
More than 10-15 mothers (pre-release versions & focus groups) have already been encouraged by this story.
The co-author son, is a media/film major in college with multiple Dean's List accolades. He has successfully written, directed, acted, in multiple movies. He can tell a good story.
This is an entertaining story without baggage (a good family read).
We found that by telling this story, we have created a platform for others to further pursue their passions and exercise their gifts i.e. videography, editing services, recording studio, audio production, camera ready artwork, featured vocalist.
The story demonstrates how generations can work through issues together. 
PerksFYI, all perks should be interpreted as our thank you gifts for your donations, and not the purchase of goods and/or services from us.
Potential Obstacles to OvercomeHere are some of the challenges that we face and how we intend to address them.
We are concerned about appropriate ""perks"".
We have chosen to lean towards ""developmental"" perks which is consistent with our general website JoMarkCreative where the focus is on helping develop others.
Meeting our funding goal concerns us.
We'll adjust by: Obtaining ""free"" ISBN and relinquishing some publishing rights; Distributing PDF versions for a significantly longer period of time.
