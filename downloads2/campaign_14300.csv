<p>Because of their size and weight, our Fine Art Editions must ship via Priority Mail International to all non-US customers, which is a bit expensive. Keep in mind that we lose a substantial percentage of what customers pay for shipping before we even see those funds due to Kickstarter and PayPal fees. Plus, there are additional costs for heavy-duty outer boxes, bubble wrap, shipping peanuts, etc. Because of this, we are actually partially subsiding foreign shipping ourselves because we have to make up the difference in what is lost due to those fees and the costs of shipping supplies.</p>
<p>That said, we greatly appreciate our foreign backers and we hope that you will understand why the international shipping is so expensive. Especially in the case of the 7+ pound Fine Art Editions, Priority Mail International is pretty much our only option to get the books to you safely and securely.</p>
<p>Also, orders shipped outside of the United States will almost always be charged customs fees when they arrive. These fees may include taxes, duties, processing fees, brokerage fees, etc. We have no control over the amount or assessment of these fees.

<p>My name is Matt 'DrDubz' Warwick, freelance illustrator and  FERAL is an ongoing labour of love I have worked on for the past 6 years, spanning 3 books and around 400+ pages of bone crunching action and heart wrenching character moments. It's been revered as a breath of fresh air in regards to anthropomorphic comics and is still going strong with three successful funding campaigns under its belt.</p>
<p>If you are interested in catching up, you can purchase the book in PDF form by clicking <strong><a href=""http://www.rocketpunchmilitia.com/feral.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. </strong>Paperback volumes will be available at a later date.</p>
<p>To quote the last campaign's description, which doesn't need changing honestly: ""FERAL is the story of a proficient fighter and hustler named Hayley Rosa, who in previous two books has made huge leaps within the fighting circuit 'FERAL' in an incredibly short time, quickly breaking into the top tier. Despite this however, events unfold that take a toll on her confidence, and awaken her dangerous nature.""</p>
<p>Book number four is where the story slows down a little. After her rage tips her over a line she never imagined she would cross, Hayley finds herself ostracized by members of the circuit, leading her to question what she's even doing in Alta to begin with, as well as where she could possibly go from there. A surprise visit on a lonely rooftop triggers something within Hayley, something that allows her to finally face the things she suppressed all these years. It will be poignant and eye opening, and also incredibly important for the story as a whole.</p>
<p>My ultimate goal with this series is to create a story that can be enjoyed by furries and non furs alike. Whether you're in it for the martial arts or the character development, you'd get something good and mature out of it. I've been drawing all my life, and have degrees in moving image media and digital animation, which are good foundations for my narrative and comic art. I'm also a martial arts film appreciator and practitioner, and it all combines to create my hard hitting style. Three books in, the trials of pro street fighter Hayley Rosa are followed by all kinds of people who've been patiently waiting for my year hiatus to end so her story can continue. As promised, this book will finally delve into <i>why</i> our protagonist is who she is.</p>

<p>Ever since my Aussie housemate paid for the first Feral prototypes to be printed, this series has been kept afloat by wonderful people who believe in the project enough to invest in it each campaign. It's been successful every year since then. The money goes towards printing costs for the various perks and of course the book itself, of which I usually print off in runs of 100, which provide enough for both contributors and random purchases online and at the Confuzzled convention in May, incidentally the deadline to complete this volume.</p>
<p>I'll be aiming for <strong>£1500</strong>, which is a perfect amount to get the printing and products done, as well as commission artists to assist in shading and inking. By January next year the majority of the book will be done, leaving final touch ups. Anything beyond that will be used for living expenses so I can concentrate on the comic itself and not really need to supplement myself with commissions that will eat into valuable comic production time. It will also allow me to continue employing artists to get more done so I can complete the perks quicker and generally relieve a lot of stress.</p>
<p>The base amount will be closer to about £1200 after Paypal takes it's cut. I'll be chipping in some of my own funds to help the general costs, but at least the bulk of it will be covered by your contributions. To break down approximate costs -</p>
<ul>
<li>100x A5 books @ 160+ pages  - £250 - £300</li>
<li>Extra copies of older books (around 100 total) - £250 - £300</li>
<li>Paid help - £100 - £120 (possibly more depending on total amount)</li>
<li>Misc (other perk rewards) - £150 - £250*</li>
<li>Postage - £300+ (world-wide shipping can be expensive when books are involved.)</li>
</ul>
<p>For your contributions, I've gathered a list of rewards that fans can appreciate greatly. I'm focusing on more physical rewards this year, as the book's contents won't have space or opportunities for crowd cameo appearances this time around. Perks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Digital and physical copies of the fourth book, signed by the author.</li>
<li>Badge commissions, that will be printed on awesome stainless steel dog tags courtesy of <strong><a href=""https://twitter.com/PawPrintingUK?lang=en-gb&amp;lang=en-gb"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Paw Printing</a>.</strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502965800/zynel1ypsovexcoru0aa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
</li>
<li>Large commissions, featuring your character facing off against one of the cast of the comic, a <strong><a href=""http://www.rocketpunchmilitia.com/uploads/7/5/2/7/7527269/ziedravstizfasize_orig.png"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">staple favourite of the campaigns so far</a></strong>.</li>
<li>A plethora of other Feral goodies, including postcards and stickers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Last campaign raised a whopping <strong>$4,350</strong> ($3945 after fees, also yes, I worked in dollars last campaigns) which was just shy of the $4500 milestone to get Feral sold at Eurofurrence. This year however, I'm not really making stretch goals, as I want to be solely focused  on the comic and the perks. That said, <strong>the more money I make, the more books I can ultimately print out and more months I can pay up to reduce commissions time</strong>. Whatever you can spare is always appreciated, so thank you in advance!</p>

<p>The risks have not changed much from previous campaigns, and I've managed to battle through no matter what. Thankfully I'm super passionate about this project, and have certainly become more proficient with the programs I use over the years. Of course there are other risks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>My computer explodes!</strong>.. Or any of my equipment honestly. Thankfully my tablet is cheap enough to replace, and I have options and backup computers, albeit slower and clunkier. Some of the funds will be allocated to fix technical issues regardless, so my progress will be slowed to a crawl rather than stopped outright</li>
<li>
<strong>Not enough moneyyyy!</strong>.. Which is a minor problem all things considered, because the comic is happening regardless of whether the final amount is made or not. If I don't get extra funds, I will have to compensate by doing commissions/ getting a part time day job, which again slows the progress immensely and may cause me to miss the May deadline. We comic artists are only human after all and I hope to create a quality product without needless stress butchering my creativity.</li>
<li>
<strong>My arm falls off.</strong>.. Or I just get very ill. Thankfully it's not too hard to  sit at a desk and draw, but again the project will be slowed. Thankfully with my paid help, the shading and type can be made if I am incapacitated for a while.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am at the moment also experimenting with various on demand print companies so I can create the books easier and allow you all to get physical copies easier and direct from printers. This will include the A4 deluxe editions promised from the last campaign, which will be two books in one, parts one + two and three+ four respectively.</p>

Tell your friends, tell your family. The more people that know this campaign exists, the greater the success, thus creating a greater product all round. Regardless, I thank you in advance for your faith, support and love for the story so far. I'm glad you're all on board, whether recent or from the start, because without you this comic would not exist.

<p>The average age of a comic book reader is somewhere in their mid-40s, and many of them are even walking away from comics because of the poor quality and crappy stories. We need to engage the next generation of comic book fans and we do that by making a solid comic that has all the things we loved about comics for the last 80 years and make sure it is suitable for all audiences.

<p>Crystal Fractal Comics is a Toronto-based comic publishing company founded by Publisher Derrek Lennox in 2007. Over six years the company has worked with some very talented people and are proud of the work we've done on our titles.</p>
<p>The Crystal Fractal Universe (CFU) itself is a mystical world fuelled by magic but ruled by deception. We've aimed to focus on providing the unexpected to readers, because we feel that's part of what makes a good story.</p>
<p><strong>The Project</strong></p>
<p><em>Doctor Twilight</em> is Crystal Fractal Comics' flagship title and centrepiece to our upcoming short film, <em>Natanael</em>. The first issue of the <em>Doctor Twilight</em> comic series was released in 2010 and since then CFC Publisher Derrek Lennox, Senior Editor Andrew Ardizzi and series writer Jeff Haas have worked to complete the second issue of the two-part arc. The great news is that we finished the script, art, lettering and editing some time ago. The bad news is that we haven't released it yet simply due to the market conditions for independent serial comics.</p>
<p>And so Crystal Fractal Comics shifted philosophies.</p>

""The Crossing"" (from CFU #0) will also be included in order to give background to readers who may be unfamiliar with the history of the Crystal Fractal Universe. Altogether the collected edition will include:</p>

The great news is that we finished the script, art, lettering and editing some time ago. The bad news is that we haven't released it yet simply due to the market conditions for independent serial comics.
And so Crystal Fractal Comics shifted philosophies.

The Heart of Vitthar graphic novel will collect Doctor Twilight number 1 (released in 2010) along with the unpublished Doctor Twilight number 2, and two unpublished short stories featuring Velvet Angel and Magus Rex that tie directly into the Heart of Vitthar storyline. ""The Crossing"" (from CFU #0) will also be included in order to give background to readers who may be unfamiliar with the history of the Crystal Fractal Universe.

Magus Rex Special (Writer: Jack Kovac; Art: JianYi)  
Velvet Angel Interlude (Writer: Derrek Lennox & Jack Kovac; Art: Thony Sillas)
The collected edition will also include character designs, artwork, and creator interviews. Altogether Dr. Twilight: The Heart of Vitthar will be 80 pages in total, with no shortage of treats for our supporters, our friends.


How will your contributions help?
Much of the work has already been done.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I want to tell a story about the challenges of getting things done in developing country governments.  Using my experiences as a development economist, I have written a story that highlights the major bottlenecks to delivering basic services in low-income settings.  In collaboration with Nigeria's foremost comic artist, Albert Ohams, I aim to turn this narrative into a graphic novel that will be distributed cost-free to schools, universities, and development organisations.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Our Story<br/>
</h3>
<p>Have you ever wondered why developing countries can't provide basic services to their people?  Why is it so difficult to implement government projects in the developing world?  Is it just down to a lack of money, to bad politics, or to corruption?  Or is the answer more complex?</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In 'Water Get Enemy: The Story of Delivering Public Services in the Developing World', I've drawn out a few answers to those questions. The story, set in the fictional country Banglageria, sketches the passage of a public project through a developing country government.  You can read the story, or listen to me read it, at <a href=""http://www.ucl.ac.uk/%7Euctpdro/teaching.html#borehole"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title=""Water Get Enemy: The story"">www.danrogger.com/teaching.html#borehole</a>.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Now I have teamed up with Nigeria's foremost cartoonist, Albert Ohams, to turn this story into a graphic novel.  We want to make a book that will open a window into the governments of the developing world, and provide insights into the problems there.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The piece brings together my experiences working in and with governments in the developing world, and messages from my discussions with civil servants, politicians, and technical assistants there.  Albert's graphics will take the reader into the heart of government, and help them see and experience the problems as they occur.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The graphic novel will be a learning tool.  I will use it in my own lectures on development (I teach at a university), and create a revolving exhibition for schools, universities, and businesses in the UK.  In collaboration with University College London, we will hold a conference on Nigerian governance with the exhibition as the centrepiece and workshops on each of the subjects with academics and Nigerian diaspora.  We will make the novel a useful resource for development partners' training initiatives.<br/></p>
<div><br/></div>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need money to pay for Albert's time.  The graphic novel will take a month or so of work.  That's where 90% of the funds we raise are going.  The rest will pay for turning it into a useful online resource, and for printing a set of exhibition prints that will travel around the UK.</p>
<br/>Any funds additional to this will be invested in methods of publicising the graphic novel once it's published.  For example, one idea is for the novel to have its own web site, with biographies of the major characters and further resources on the subjects addressed in the story.<br/><br/>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Thank you so much for your donations.  There are other ways you can help.  If you read the story and have comments to improve it, please let me have them.  If you can help me with ideas to promote the graphic novel once it's published, these would be warmly welcome.  Of course, once it is published, the more people who help publicise it, the more useful it will be.<br/></p>

Our Story

Have you ever wondered why developing countries can't provide basic services to their people?  Why is it so difficult to implement government projects in the developing world?  Is it just down to a lack of money, to bad politics, or to corruption?  Or is the answer more complex?

In 'Water Get Enemy: The Story of Delivering Public Services in the Developing World', I've drawn out a few answers to those questions. The story, set in the fictional country Banglageria, sketches the passage of a public project through a developing country government.  You can read the story, or listen to me read it, at www.danrogger.com/teaching.html#borehole.

Now I have teamed up with Nigeria's foremost cartoonist, Albert Ohams, to turn this story into a graphic novel.  We want to make a book that will open a window into the governments of the developing world, and provide insights into the problems there.


The Impact

The piece brings together my experiences working in and with governments in the developing world, and messages from my discussions with civil servants, politicians, and technical assistants there.  Albert's graphics will take the reader into the heart of government, and help them see and experience the problems as they occur.

The graphic novel will be a learning tool.  I will use it in my own lectures on development (I teach at a university), and create a revolving exhibition for schools, universities, and businesses in the UK.  In collaboration with University College London, we will hold a conference on Nigerian governance with the exhibition as the centrepiece and workshops on each of the subjects with academics and Nigerian diaspora.  We will make the novel a useful resource for development partners' training initiatives.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Martin John, creator, writer and letterer of Foreign Matter. Two years ago I decided to chase my dreams and start writing for real. A script that I wrote for an idea that my brother and I came up with thirteen years ago has shaped up in a way that I had never thought it would. I thought I would pitch it, aiming for an indie publisher, and decided to hire an artist in order to make that pitch a reality. I would have five pages of artwork based on my script. I went to digital webbing and out of all the applicants there was one wonderful artist named German Ponce that replied in a prompt and efficient manner. German did all the character designs for Foreign Matter in no time whatsoever, we had started our comic adventures together. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Through research into the industry and having my brain rattled by talking to professionals on message boards I was told that no one would want to buy my superhero comic book, as Marvel and DC comics were doing the genre and doing it better than I ever would. I was also told that my comic would never see print, would never get on a comic stand, and it would be better to find a way to present in online. Cue, <a href=""http://www.foreignmattercomic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.foreignmattercomic.com</a>, and me hiring German on a regular basis in order to finish the twelve issues of our comic. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We have found a publisher in What The Flux Comics. We have produced four full issues of comic and are into the beginning of the fifth. You can help fund our dream and make great comics with us. Or you can spread the word about our cause to others in order to help. We are the little indie that could, Foreign Matter. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Funding will allow me (Martin John) to climb out of the debt I have accrued and pay my art team an appropriate amount of money for their services for the first six issues. As the creator and writer of this project I take the financial responsibility for it. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In the end I will have spent over $25000 on this project, and that goes directly to German (an artist in Argentina) and Dave (an artist in the United States). This pays for their page rate. I am asking for one fifth of this in order to feel more comfortable in that fact that I will not go bankrupt while making the first half of this comic. Any money you pay towards Foreign Matter's Indie Go-Go goes to supporting artists. The money I have paid German so far has gone towards dental work, medical work, and rent as he attempts to get notice. Your dollars will be well spent. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Prizes include pdf copies, eternal gratitude, advance pdfs that no one has ever seen (you get the first look at issue three), copies of the comics, limited hardcover journals with autographs,  limited prints of amazing pinup art from three different artists and limited to twenty-five copies each, and one lucky person gets to be eviscerated in the pages of our comic (yay). <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>

<h3>Pop-Up Concertina</h3>
<p>Do you like cheap art that you can spread out on your mantelpiece OR tuck away on a bookshelf? </p>
<p>Do you like illustrations with tiny details and hidden stories, with new things to discover each time you look at them?</p>
<p>Do you like pop-ups? (What am I saying, EVERYBODY likes pop-ups!)</p>
<p><img alt=""concertina all the way open"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.shelbymakes.com/online/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/concertina41.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>My name is Shelby Arnold, I have been a designer in <a href=""http://wp.robertsabuda.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Robert Sabuda's</a> studio for about five years. If you know his work, it's needless to say that I know pop-ups pretty well. I've been working on this project for about six months on my own time, and I'm excited to see it get printed up for people to enjoy! </p>
<p>I'm raising money to pay for 1,000 copies to get printed by a local printer here in Brooklyn where I live. Right now I'm hoping to go with <a href=""http://www.rollingpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rolling Press</a> - an eco-friendly printer in Park Slope. They have been really helpful and detail oriented in the process of putting a quote together for this strange project - qualities you want from a good printer! All the money I raise will go towards the printing - I'm doing the cutting and folding by hand (on an on-demand basis).</p>
<p><strong>So, what is it?<br/></strong>The Pop-Up Concertina is an accordion-folded booklet with pop-ups, covered on both sides with drawings I made using a bunch of .005 micron pens over the course of several months. I then scanned the drawings and assembled them into a digital file that will be sent to the printer. There are tons of little scenes and pictures, but no words. You can look at it page by page like a book (which never ends, it just turns over and continues in a loop), or you can spread it out and look at it all as one (double-sided) piece.

<p><em>Some things you may be asking yourself when you look at this piece:</em></p>
<p><strong>Why are you self-publishing it?</strong> <br/>This piece is more of an art book for the likes of indie comic book stores and art festivals. I'd rather be able to get it out on a table and sell it myself than be shopping around to publishers, trying to convince them why my oddly-formatted, some-assembly-required piece would be worth it for them to produce.</p>
<p><strong>How are the pop-ups assembled?</strong><br/>I'm publishing this thing myself, so after I get it back from the printer, I'm doing all the cutting and folding by hand. I knew from the beginning that I wanted to keep the assembly as simple as possible, so the pop-ups are all designed to be quick cuts off the folds, rather than separate pieces that need to be cut out and glued together indivudually.<br/><br/>Simple construction doesn't mean the pop-ups are less interesting! In fact, because they are cut right out of the page, there are some really fun interactions from one page to another as cut-outs appear and disappear when you turn the pages.</p>
<p><strong>Why is the deadline so soon?<br/></strong>I have some table space reserved at <a href=""http://www.societyillustrators.org/Mocca_Event.aspx?id=8605"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MOCCA Fest 2013</a> on April 6th and 7th. My goal is to have printed copies of the pop-up concertina on my table at MOCCA Fest, assembled and ready to sell! This means I need enough time before the festival to get everything printed up and a few copies assembled. HOWEVER, the sooner the deadline, the sooner you get your copies, too!

</div></div>","Pop-Up Concertina
Do you like cheap art that you can spread out on your mantelpiece OR tuck away on a bookshelf? 
Do you like illustrations with tiny details and hidden stories, with new things to discover each time you look at them?
Do you like pop-ups? (What am I saying, EVERYBODY likes pop-ups!)

My name is Shelby Arnold, I have been a designer in Robert Sabuda's studio for about five years. If you know his work, it's needless to say that I know pop-ups pretty well. I've been working on this project for about six months on my own time, and I'm excited to see it get printed up for people to enjoy! 
I'm raising money to pay for 1,000 copies to get printed by a local printer here in Brooklyn where I live. Right now I'm hoping to go with Rolling Press - an eco-friendly printer in Park Slope. They have been really helpful and detail oriented in the process of putting a quote together for this strange project - qualities you want from a good printer! All the money I raise will go towards the printing - I'm doing the cutting and folding by hand (on an on-demand basis).
So, what is it?The Pop-Up Concertina is an accordion-folded booklet with pop-ups, covered on both sides with drawings I made using a bunch of .005 micron pens over the course of several months. I then scanned the drawings and assembled them into a digital file that will be sent to the printer. There are tons of little scenes and pictures, but no words. You can look at it page by page like a book (which never ends, it just turns over and continues in a loop), or you can spread it out and look at it all as one (double-sided) piece. Every way you look at it reveals new connections and interactions - the cut-outs and folds allow the pages and illustrations to change and connect to each other in different configurations.

What size is it?The flattened piece will be 38 inches long by about 6 inches tall. Folded, it is about 4 inches wide by 6 inches tall, with ten panels/pages on each side. There are seven pop-ups in the piece, they have art on both sides as well.

The LudoSport Founder Masters developed the heart of a story years ago when the real and imaginary planes merge, where real people could move from one plane to the other via sports competition.
I Maestri Fondatori LudoSport svilupparono anni fa il nucleo di una storia in cui il piano reale e quello immaginario si intrecciassero, dove persone vere potessero passare da uno all’altro attraverso la competizione sportiva.

<p><strong>STORY: </strong>“Voluntaryist” is the story about a superhero who finds himself pitted against the government as the government tries to enslave humanity once and for all.  He is a young man with extraordinary powers created through a chance encounter with cosmic radiation. His personal mission is to rescue his parents from government agents, but that objective is often frustrated with the likes of giant monsters, super-villains, and even the U.S. armed forces.</p>
<p>The purpose of this comic is to give a sense of what is going on in America and, in addition, to offer the reader inspiration that something can be done to stop the coming dystopian future. It also promotes Voluntaryist values in the narrative. (If you don’t know what that is, simply google the “Non-aggression principle.”)</p>
<p>The second issue will either be a continuation of the first issue or a special short depending on the funds raised.</p>
<p><strong>CREATOR: </strong>The idea for the comic was created by Voluntaryist fanatic and costumer Jaime Sherman, whose passion for liberty is only matched by his passion for dressing in spandex super-suits. He began the long process of creating the series while trudging through his legal studies in school.</p>
<p><strong>GOAL:  </strong>To get the second issue released in .pdf and print to share with you, and, eventually, the world. <br/><br/><strong>We will produce as much of the comic as we can get funded for. In the event of a shortfall, we may produce a mini-comic outside the chronological timeline.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p><strong>We need to raise about $5000 to get this comic fully going, but we set our goal at $4000 to absorb more of the funds.</strong></p>
<p>The expenses are largely for the cost of hiring an artist to produce the comic and the expenses associated with putting the comic into digital format. <br/><br/> You can support us by making a <strong>contribution </strong>on the right-hand side by<strong> Credit Card/Debit Card</strong> or <strong>Paypal</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition, you can redeem <strong>perks</strong> for your support such as:</p>

If short by more than $1000, we may produce a mini-comic outside the chronological order.</p>
<p><strong>Production</strong></p>
<p>The second issue will be produced primarily after the campaign is over, so the comic will be sent to you a few months after the 50 days are up.<br/><br/> However, we will give you teasers, sketches, and tidbits on our Website, <a href=""http://volcomic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://volcomic.com</a> so you can learn more about the backstory in anticipation of the comic's release.</p>
<p><strong>YOUR Impact</strong></p>
<p>While the comic is a fun relief from reality, our hope is that the comic is something beyond its entertainment value. We would like the comic to get into the hands of people who are unfamiliar with Voluntaryism and the current state of affairs. We want to wake people up to Voluntaryism and truly-free living using the comic medium because it communicates without being pretentious.</p>
<p><strong>PUBLIC RELEASE:</strong></p>
<p>We will be releasing the comic for you to download for free (whatever we can find that will allow us to post it for free)…but those who paid to get the comic e-mailed or printed will receive it FIRST and will receive the comic about a month AHEAD of everyone else.</p>
<p>SO, with that in mind, don’t be shy about supporting at the $2 or $5 levels because EVERY dollar counts to making the comic come into existence. That we need you to be our hero for!</p>

--->$500 BE DRAWN INTO A SUPERHERO. Have you ever wanted to be made into a superhero? Get turned into a comic character and be presented on a supporters’ page inside the comic! You will also receive the digital file of your character. (Due to time constraints, Jaime will have final say as to the character’s final design implementation, but will make best efforts to accommodate the design.) Make sure you provide your correct mailing address and e-mail to receive this.
IF we do not reach our goal by (but we will thanks to you!), we will produce as many pages of the comic as we can afford and still send those out to the people who supported to receive the comic in .pdf format/printed format if short by $1000 or less. If short by more than $1000, we may produce a mini-comic outside the chronological order.
Production
The second issue will be produced primarily after the campaign is over, so the comic will be sent to you a few months after the 50 days are up. However, we will give you teasers, sketches, and tidbits on our Website, http://volcomic.com so you can learn more about the backstory in anticipation of the comic's release.
YOUR Impact
While the comic is a fun relief from reality, our hope is that the comic is something beyond its entertainment value. We would like the comic to get into the hands of people who are unfamiliar with Voluntaryism and the current state of affairs. We want to wake people up to Voluntaryism and truly-free living using the comic medium because it communicates without being pretentious.
PUBLIC RELEASE:
We will be releasing the comic for you to download for free (whatever we can find that will allow us to post it for free)…but those who paid to get the comic e-mailed or printed will receive it FIRST and will receive the comic about a month AHEAD of everyone else.
SO, with that in mind, don’t be shy about supporting at the $2 or $5 levels because EVERY dollar counts to making the comic come into existence. That we need you to be our hero for!

THE COMIC
 
“They say he was created by darkness itself, a manifest of the shadows
he now confines himself to. The Monstrum of our town. The Hunter. Where he
walks, darkness follows. Where darkness lays, death comes upon.
 
That’s what I heard anyway. Or it might have been a movie.”
 
Hairy Steve is a dark brooding beast, a freakish hairy hero just
trying to keep himself to himself. Hiding away in the dark. Bothering no one.
An outsider trying to ignore the world, but constantly being dragged back into
it.
 
Steve finds humans annoying, despite spending his days pulling them
from the jaws of danger. See, humans don’t understand Steve, and he thinks
they’re idiots, but one thing he hates more than humans is injustice. So if
someone’s in danger or there is a crime afoot, Steve reluctantly emerges from
his hiding to help.
 
Tonight, however, events are about to spiral rapidly out of control
and drag him right down with them. As Steve accidentally crunches a zombie’s
skull, the city begins to fill with the walking undead. And an elderly Nazi
socialite, buxom nurse and seemingly random crime increase all have something
to do with it. As we crash, smash and explode our way to the finale, Steve
might just have to save everyone in this godforsaken town, or die trying.
 
'Hairy Steve vs. The Zombie Army' is a 24-page black and white comic book, written by Jamie
Smart and illustrated by Steve Bright. It's both hilarious and brutal, featuring lashings of swearing, violence, and
other glorious wrongdoings.
 

THE STORY OF HAIRY STEVE, AND HOW YOU CAN HELP
(by Jamie Smart)
 
Here's the rub. I worked alongside Steve Bright quite a few years ago on a popular UK children's comic and was always blown away by his artwork. I'd been writing a more grown-up comic book called Hairy Steve, but didn't feel like it was something I could draw myself. It needed real OOMPH in the art, and Steve's style would be perfect for it, so I took him the idea and was chuffed when he agreed to have a crack at it. As the first few pages of finished artwork came back I was convinced this could really be something, the partnership between us produced work I'm incredibly proud of. However, after only completing four pages, time and circumstance conspired to leave Hairy Steve behind and we
both returned to doing paid work instead.

I often yearned to see Hairy Steve fully realised, and poked mister
Bright about it a few times over the years. But although Steve enjoyed the idea of completing this comic as much as me, realistically he couldn't afford to take such a huge chunk of time out to devote to it. So this year, I suggested the idea of funding this project online. It seemed absolutely
ideal, with your help this goes from being a whimsical side-project to a paying
gig for Steve (who is as hard a working self-employed illustrator as anyone),
meaning he can spend the time on it that it deserves. I get to see my idea made (hairy) flesh, and
you get a cracking comic book out of it. Everyone wins!
 
Our goal was set at $2,000. A small chunk of this will pay for the limited-run printing
of the Hairy Steve comic, and all that's left will go to the artist Steve Bright. I will take no profit from this, I want to see if this system works and if the incredible work Steve's putting into our comic will reap reward.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Grace</span> is a graphic novella written by my brother Cedric and illustrated by moi, Madeline Richards. After many moons our our tall tale is on the verge of completion.

Grace is a graphic novella written by my brother Cedric and illustrated by moi, Madeline Richards. After many moons our our tall tale is on the verge of completion. In the style of Rumpelstiltskin and The Emperor's New Clothes our story cautions its reader on the perils of falling pray to the vanities in life.

<p><br/></p>
<p>Our plans for those whom donate via IndieGoGo and help us achieve our goal will be given a characters in the ongoing series to forever immortalize themselves in comic books. Here's what we have in mind; you will receive 2 copies signed and numbered from the series creators (Erin A Pyne, Larry Jarrell, Russ Leach and Amy Vitale), and original art created by Larry Jarrell or Russ Leach from the Red Angel series of Characters (valued at 30.00 per illustration).</p>

<p></p></div>","And the campaign is now over! Thank you everyone for supporting the campaign, making the second book a reality. I'm going to be super busy with the amount of extra contents that will be in the book. This includes a special short story, a special comic, many guest arts and more! But, for now, let's celebrate! Thank you all!Hello everyone! I'm gonna be busy from now on, managing the file of the book, because Wuffle the Big Nice Wolf Year 2 is going to be printed! We’ve reached the goal! Hooray!Thank you so much everyone! There are still more than 50 days to contribute and get some rewards before the campaign ends, but for now, guys, LET'S START WUFFLIN'!Our editor, Guts, has something to say to all the readers, too:""Our campaign for printing Wuffle book 2 just reached the goal today! Thanks everyone for your contribution, be it monetarily or helping us spread the word. It's amazing to see that this project got funded within a few days. Did you know that it took us one whole month for last year's campaign to reach the goal? Hopefully Wuffle will be an example to show that you don't need copyright to make money from your work. If you do the best you can and care about those who like your work, your fans will care about you and support you in return.We still have many weeks left and I'd love to see the campaign reach the stretch goal. Let's see how far we can go this time!Anyway, just a friendly reminder that our comics are in the public domain and free for anyone to use. You can even print them and sell them if you want to!""Stretch goals update!It's been 2 years since I began drawing Wuffle comics, and now it's time to print the second volume! Let's make it happen!This will be a Fixed Funding campaign like last time, meaning that if this campaign doesn't reach the goal, you will get a refund, and the book won't be printed. But I will still continue drawing Wuffle for you, and hopefully I can try again in the future.You can read Wuffle Year 2 comics here: Official Website, Tumblr or FacebookOr download and read at once: DownloadWuffle Year 1 is also available for free download as a PDF via Gumroad.Why free? Read here: Wuffle is in the public domain.The funding goal is higher this time because the book will be thicker than the first volume. The comic itself has many more pages than volume 1, with longer stories. This means that the printing costs will be higher too.Book Features:

All of the comics from the second year (14th Febuary 2013 - 28th February 2014) will be included.


All comics will be proofread by a professional proofreader, and any errors from the webcomic version will be corrected.

Special illustrations will be made for the book by me and several guest artists.
These will be printed in a hard-cover A5-size full color 150-180 page book format.See the bigger version of book cover: click

I will improve some comics that included mistakes when they were first released. This will include some new scenes, new drawings, and extended stories.

Shipping times will be faster; instead of 2 months after the finished print run, books will ship within 2 weeks after the books are printed! The print run should be finished around 2 months after the campaign ends.
You'll get a print of the book, you can have your name on the book as one of the sponsors, a signed copy of the book, and many more rewards! Here are the pictures for more details :$6500 REACHED! : ""There's Something About Foxxo"" A special short story written by our proofreader and story adviser, Leonard Kirke, and approved by me. This short tale is about Foxxo's first big business deal, though it might not turn out the way he planned. I will do special illustrations for this short story.============================$7000 REACHED! - $8000 REACHED!  : A special comic for book 2. There is one story that I've wanted to draw for a while, but I hadn't found the right time and place for it until now. It's called ROBIN WUFF.A parody comic of Disney's version of Robin Hood, but in Wuffle style!I want this to be the first episode in an occasional mini-series chronicling the adventures of Robin Wuff. Since the characters are so perfectly matched, I don't want it to end with just one comic.So let's make it happen! If we reach $7000 , then I'll draw the comic, but in black and white. If it reaches $8000, then the comic will be in color!::::::::::::::::::::::UPDATE : We've just reached the comic in GLORIOUS TECHNICOLOR! Thank you everyone! ;_;============================$15000 : I don't have a definite plan for further stretch goals yet. But I always wanted to do some short animation of Wuffle, based on one of the early 4 panel comics. So it'll be a very, very short animation with music but no dialogue (since we don't know who to cast and voice Wuffle XD).The style will be classic 2D animation like back in the old days, from the Golden Age of Animation (just like the dancing Wuffle that you see on this page). I'm very passionate about 2D animation, so if we can reach this goal, I won't be able to say thank you enough! Making a short animation like this is one of my dreams, and I'll be very grateful if you help me make it come true!Other short animations I've made years ago.            The animation might take some time to finish, so if we can reach this goal, I will ship all the books to you first and then I'll keep updating on the animation until it's done! ^^============================And that's all folks! We still have plenty of time before the campaign ends on May 15, 2014. Share the campaign, show it to your friends, and help make this project go further together!Not everyone can support the campaign directly, but you can help me by spreading the news about the campaign, sharing the comic for free with your friends, your family, aliens from another dimension, everyone!

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>

<p>Yet completing the manuscript was only the beginning. We need your help in order to be able to print and distribute this already finished work to you.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>The book has already been completed!</strong> Therefore, <strong>your entire contribution shall go directly toward the scanning, printing and distribution of <i>Art of Unlearning</i></strong>.</li>
<li>
<i>Art of Unlearning</i> is a guide to creativity. A masterfully illustrated manual for any innovator who wishes to go beyond the resistance of their culture, and the limitations of their mind and body, in order to realize their innate potential. Through its young protagonist Gituma, the graphic novel explores how to overcome fear. He discovers creativity is the key to freedom and freedom is the key to creativity. </li>
<li>
<i>Art of Unlearning</i> is a 9”x 12” 130 page, ink illustrated book in both soft cover and Limited Edition hard cover. </li>
<li>
<i>Art of Unlearning </i>was written and illustrated by Kenyan graphic novelist Chief Nyamweya. </li>
<li>We hope to print an initial run of 250 copies (or more if we achieve our stretch goals), and have it shipped out to backers in December 2018 ahead of the Holiday Season. </li>

What We Need & What You Get

Art of Unlearning was illustrated for over 18 months by Chief Nyamweya on a remote farm in the Rift Valley. Not a single digital device was used in its creation. Only pens, brushes and ink were applied in creating this emotionally compelling graphic novel.
Yet completing the manuscript was only the beginning. We need your help in order to be able to print and distribute this already finished work to you.


The book has already been completed! Therefore, your entire contribution shall go directly toward the scanning, printing and distribution of Art of Unlearning.

Art of Unlearning is a guide to creativity. A masterfully illustrated manual for any innovator who wishes to go beyond the resistance of their culture, and the limitations of their mind and body, in order to realize their innate potential. Through its young protagonist Gituma, the graphic novel explores how to overcome fear. He discovers creativity is the key to freedom and freedom is the key to creativity. 

Art of Unlearning is a 9”x 12” 130 page, ink illustrated book in both soft cover and Limited Edition hard cover. 

Art of Unlearning was written and illustrated by Kenyan graphic novelist Chief Nyamweya. 
We hope to print an initial run of 250 copies (or more if we achieve our stretch goals), and have it shipped out to backers in December 2018 ahead of the Holiday Season.

<h2>Synopsis: SKULL KIDS</h2>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/8b5afikuUes?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>Born of parents connected through a forbidden love. Twin siblings Ellien and Andre are raised by the Archangel Malakh after the demise of their parents. Trained as mere children to be members of the Death Whisperers, a team of merciless warriors for the side of heaven, by order of Gabrielle highest ranked of the Archangels. As centuries pass, the war for the Holy Kingdom and the souls of humans grows more intense. The siblings become more skilled, and dangerous in the eyes of Gabrielle who, in the apparent absence of the Most High, has taken rank and has decided the loyalty of the children is questionable.  After sabotaging the children in a battle against the demon guard of the Dark Prince, Gabrielle offers the children a chance to save and protect each others souls. He reasons, that by committing to the side of heaven, he can guarantee that upon completion of his given task in his given time, they will be freed to live eternity in the Vast, a hidden sanctuary thought to have been created by the Most High for the souls of the most honorable to rest in.  To receive this “pardon”, the children must fight upon request and eliminate high ranking generals and lords under the Prince of Darkness. If they complete the list, it weakens the ranks of Hell giving the Heavens the upper hand in this war, and allows them peace after centuries of fighting.  However, failing to complete the list in the time given, means damnation, and failure to do the only thing that has ever mattered to them both, protecting each other…. </p>

<h2><strong>Why This Story wOlly?</strong></h2>
<p>I'm happy you asked. Being independent means I get to offer stories that don't fit the norm. I love the spandex heroes and villains greatly. Because of them, I got deeply into comics like most, but as a creator, that lane is pretty full. That doesn't mean I will never create or work on anything in that lane, as a freelance illustrator I work on those type stories and pieces all the time, it just means that I can explore other stories. Create things based in other worlds, timelines, realities, subjects, and creatures. This in itself is a challenge, but still a chance to explore comics and graphic novel stories in a different. The Skull Kids are our main characters, but they aren't your typical heroes. They dwell in a world of angels and demons, gods and devils. But at the core, it is a story of family, bonds, fighting the right path, and fighting for what you believe in and love. This story just does it in a very wild way at times!! Having a boy and girl myself, my thought became, what is that bond that siblings share? How deep is it? What, if anything, can stand in between it? Making them twins in a world of spiritual beings just ups the ante, and having them be kids just makes it cooler when you see them in action against creatures who walked the earth before man existed. This story has been in my head for over 10 years, below is the first piece I ever did on them.....</p>

<h3>How you can help, where that help goes, and what you get!!</h3>
<p>So, this isn't my first rodeo in the world of self publishing. To date, I have completely self published about 9 projects. Meaning projects that I gathered all the funding for without a fund raiser. These were years back when I was learning about the world of comics and figuring it all out (still am in some ways, due to the constant change of the world and how things are consumed). After those projects, I produced and published about 4 art books, 4 issues of a personal project, and two trade paper backs (graphic novels). One project, Legend of the Black Pandas, was partially funded here on indiegogo, and another Fairy Tale Knights 122 pgs, reached it's goal here on indiegogo, and continues to sale well today. These past projects have taught me a ton about putting a book together, shipping and the issues that come with it, and just staying in touch with those that support. This book will be my third project seeking help with funding, but of course you get something in return!! I have perks like the book itself in various forms, an option for all 3 of my graphic novels in print or digital format, original artwork, bookmarks, prints, your image in the book as a than you, vinyl figures, and more!!  I also want to make sure that I stress to everyone, money is a <strong>GREAT!!</strong> form of support, <u><strong>BUT!!</strong></u>  Word of mouth is also. Every time you share this page, a piece of art for the campaign,  tell someone about it, like it, anything! That brings new eyes to the project, which helps it grow. Review sites, news and media outlets, social media, comic shops, friends, family, enemies!! All are needed to make this happen, and I am thankful and grateful!!</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The big thing here for me is just continuing to prove it can be done. Showing that different art styles, stories, and subjects are needed, wanted, and supported. This matters, not just for me, but to others who see these moments and are inspired to do their own stories, or encourage kids to create, or support things beyond the normal. I am not expecting to open new doors over night, but I believe supporting cool projects like these help the bigger companies to see there is support out there. In some cases it makes the more open to seeing what else is there, and possible stand behind it. The other side is, indie creators can stand with the people even if the companies don't support. The reality is, you the people, are what makes all of this work. No support from you, and even the mighty big 3 have to change things up. You have the power (he-man voice).</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge is getting the word out. I stepped past the hurdle of self doubts, fears, concerns, by making this a reality in this form at all. That doesn't mean I am not still biting my nails as this launches, lol, but I have stepped past one of the biggest challenges. Our own doubts.  So now, I have to work hard to get this in front of others who may dig the art, the story, me as a person, or all the above. The risk is, I may not reach everyone. I want to spread this and my past projects to all possible, so your help with that counts on a major scale!! But even if I don't hit the goal, I will still push to make this book a reality. The funds raised, will simply help to get the project regardless. My goal isn't set at a place that pays me a wage to do the book, it is set to cover cost to print books, book marks, prints, cover shipping, and whatever else goes into the perks. Plus of course the fees for indiegogo, and paypal, and whoever else has hands in the pot. One day I hope to be in a place where my creator owned projects can raise that type of funding, but in the meantime, I just want to keep putting out solid books!! So please, help me to surpass the risk and challenges and make this happen!!</p>

</div></div>","Synopsis: SKULL KIDS

Born of parents connected through a forbidden love. Twin siblings Ellien and Andre are raised by the Archangel Malakh after the demise of their parents. Trained as mere children to be members of the Death Whisperers, a team of merciless warriors for the side of heaven, by order of Gabrielle highest ranked of the Archangels. As centuries pass, the war for the Holy Kingdom and the souls of humans grows more intense. The siblings become more skilled, and dangerous in the eyes of Gabrielle who, in the apparent absence of the Most High, has taken rank and has decided the loyalty of the children is questionable.  After sabotaging the children in a battle against the demon guard of the Dark Prince, Gabrielle offers the children a chance to save and protect each others souls. He reasons, that by committing to the side of heaven, he can guarantee that upon completion of his given task in his given time, they will be freed to live eternity in the Vast, a hidden sanctuary thought to have been created by the Most High for the souls of the most honorable to rest in.  To receive this “pardon”, the children must fight upon request and eliminate high ranking generals and lords under the Prince of Darkness. If they complete the list, it weakens the ranks of Hell giving the Heavens the upper hand in this war, and allows them peace after centuries of fighting.  However, failing to complete the list in the time given, means damnation, and failure to do the only thing that has ever mattered to them both, protecting each other…. 
Skull Kids. 75 pages, Color, and all out coolness!!

Why This Story wOlly?
I'm happy you asked. Being independent means I get to offer stories that don't fit the norm. I love the spandex heroes and villains greatly. Because of them, I got deeply into comics like most, but as a creator, that lane is pretty full. That doesn't mean I will never create or work on anything in that lane, as a freelance illustrator I work on those type stories and pieces all the time, it just means that I can explore other stories. Create things based in other worlds, timelines, realities, subjects, and creatures. This in itself is a challenge, but still a chance to explore comics and graphic novel stories in a different. The Skull Kids are our main characters, but they aren't your typical heroes. They dwell in a world of angels and demons, gods and devils. But at the core, it is a story of family, bonds, fighting the right path, and fighting for what you believe in and love. This story just does it in a very wild way at times!! Having a boy and girl myself, my thought became, what is that bond that siblings share? How deep is it? What, if anything, can stand in between it? Making them twins in a world of spiritual beings just ups the ante, and having them be kids just makes it cooler when you see them in action against creatures who walked the earth before man existed. This story has been in my head for over 10 years, below is the first piece I ever did on them.....


How you can help, where that help goes, and what you get!!
So, this isn't my first rodeo in the world of self publishing. To date, I have completely self published about 9 projects. Meaning projects that I gathered all the funding for without a fund raiser. These were years back when I was learning about the world of comics and figuring it all out (still am in some ways, due to the constant change of the world and how things are consumed). After those projects, I produced and published about 4 art books, 4 issues of a personal project, and two trade paper backs (graphic novels). One project, Legend of the Black Pandas, was partially funded here on indiegogo, and another Fairy Tale Knights 122 pgs, reached it's goal here on indiegogo, and continues to sale well today. These past projects have taught me a ton about putting a book together, shipping and the issues that come with it, and just staying in touch with those that support. This book will be my third project seeking help with funding, but of course you get something in return!! I have perks like the book itself in various forms, an option for all 3 of my graphic novels in print or digital format, original artwork, bookmarks, prints, your image in the book as a than you, vinyl figures, and more!!  I also want to make sure that I stress to everyone, money is a GREAT!! form of support, BUT!!  Word of mouth is also. Every time you share this page, a piece of art for the campaign,  tell someone about it, like it, anything! That brings new eyes to the project, which helps it grow. Review sites, news and media outlets, social media, comic shops, friends, family, enemies!! All are needed to make this happen, and I am thankful and grateful!!


 
The Impact
The big thing here for me is just continuing to prove it can be done. Showing that different art styles, stories, and subjects are needed, wanted, and supported. This matters, not just for me, but to others who see these moments and are inspired to do their own stories, or encourage kids to create, or support things beyond the normal. I am not expecting to open new doors over night, but I believe supporting cool projects like these help the bigger companies to see there is support out there. In some cases it makes the more open to seeing what else is there, and possible stand behind it. The other side is, indie creators can stand with the people even if the companies don't support. The reality is, you the people, are what makes all of this work. No support from you, and even the mighty big 3 have to change things up. You have the power (he-man voice).


 

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge is getting the word out. I stepped past the hurdle of self doubts, fears, concerns, by making this a reality in this form at all. That doesn't mean I am not still biting my nails as this launches, lol, but I have stepped past one of the biggest challenges. Our own doubts.  So now, I have to work hard to get this in front of others who may dig the art, the story, me as a person, or all the above. The risk is, I may not reach everyone. I want to spread this and my past projects to all possible, so your help with that counts on a major scale!! But even if I don't hit the goal, I will still push to make this book a reality. The funds raised, will simply help to get the project regardless. My goal isn't set at a place that pays me a wage to do the book, it is set to cover cost to print books, book marks, prints, cover shipping, and whatever else goes into the perks. Plus of course the fees for indiegogo, and paypal, and whoever else has hands in the pot. One day I hope to be in a place where my creator owned projects can raise that type of funding, but in the meantime, I just want to keep putting out solid books!! So please, help me to surpass the risk and challenges and make this happen!!


THANK YOU.
 
If you read all this, I thank you, if you didn't, I thank you. Whatever the case, thank you!!
Perks.

<h3><strong><i>… in life … sometimes things are not always black and white, in those shades of grey, the hard choices are made …</i></strong></h3>
<p>Decisions: A Minor Variation is a full color one-shot comic book featuring THREE stories written by Martin T Pierro. This is the fourth Decisions one-shot from Cosmic Times and marks the first time that Martin has written a comic in nearly a decade.</p>
<p>The first story is “I Hear the Train a Comin” featuring art by Fredson Oliveira. It finds John, a man literally at a crossroads, he has lost all hope, he is giving up on his dreams and his very life. With time running out an etherial guide visits John to try to turn him down a different path … is there enough time or will darkness rule the day?</p>
<p>The second story “My Brother's Keeper” features artwork from Michael Dorman. The story begins at a funeral, we find Quinton grieving the loss of his younger brother. In anger Quinton and others blame another boy - Dante for leading his brother down a path that brought him to the grave. Two etherial guides arrive and take Quinton on a journey through is past that will change his perception and will force him to face a hard truth.</p>
<p>The third and final story ""Policy of Truth"" is very socially relevant and dark in tone. It follows a young police officer faced with a dark future or a painful truth. This story features the artistic talents of original Decisions artist Zach Bassett. </p>

<h2>Why Support Decisions?</h2>
<p>From the beginning Decisions has been a series of one-shots that tackles hard issues and deals with them directly, no metaphors, no hidden meanings - just hard realities. This new offering continues to do the same, it’s not flashy, there is no gimmick just quality storytelling with artwork to match. The three stories contained in A Minor Variation are written by Martin Pierro, his first time solo writing in nearly a decade. These are challenging tales that deal with very hard, very personal issues. While Decisions is story focused, we still are attempting to cater to collectors by offering variant covers by the artists that created the interior pages.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>12 Children</strong> is an intimate look into the life of a family of thirteen before and after they were forced to leave Egypt in the 1960s. Nonna is a widow, alone in purgatory watching over a family who is divided without her. Through this separation, she learns not only have her children always needed her, but she has always needed them. They find their way back to each other in this illustrated novel.</p>
<p>My name is Dominique Agri and <strong>12 Children</strong> is a fictionalized story of my mother's family. My mother moved to Brooklyn, NY in 1961 after the dictator Nassar exiled all non-Arabic peoples from Egypt. They arrived with no money, no other family and with no knowledge of the language or culture. The younger children were forced to assimilate while the older children clung to a past that no longer existed. My grandfather died of cancer shortly after their arrival and my grandmother was left alone.</p>
<p>This story is important because it holds the history and culture not of merely one family, but an entire people. The Sephardic Jewish community needs stories of their people so we never forget where we came from.?</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am asking for donations so I may self-publish a 150-page graphic novel. I must pay my artist ($75 per page) as well as a colorist and a letterer. On top of that are printing costs (approximately $0.50 per page). After this, the costs remain pretty low. The book will feature in the Diamond Catalogue and as I have ties to several comic book stores in NYC, they will add the book to their retail list. Also, the book will be sold via my personal comic book website, <a href=""http://www.ComicsPeriod.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.ComicsPeriod.com</a>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Personal stories of family, hardship and perseverance are what teach many of us how to cope with our own struggles. They inspire us toward growth and understanding of one another. These kinds of stories are realatively new to the graphic genre but they are rapidly becoming a staple within the comic book community.</p>
<p>The addition of images to words in a novel of this nature is not only thought provoking but emotionally provacative. </p>
<p>Essex County by Jeff Lemire or Fun Home by Alison Bechdel are excellent examples of this.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If this sounds interesting to you, please feel free to talk about it with your friends. Perhaps if you have the time you might choose to add a link to this campaign to your facebook or twitter accounts. Anything and everything is extremely appreciated!</p>

<p>Distribution expansion is an intensive process and can be costly depending on how much product is needed after a store accepts a pitch for product placement. We'll be partnering up with RangeMe to pitch our products to dozens of interested retailers across the world. We already have a few that are interested and the funds we raise will allow us to take the necessary next steps. </p>

<h3>More comics in more places</h3>
<p>For those that don't know, Alterna has been around since 2006. We primarily published graphic novels in the first ten years of our existence and in May 2017 we launched a single issue line that featured interiors printed on newsprint. The newsprint is what allows us to have such affordable cover prices while still turning a profit for ourselves and our creators.</p>
<p>Part of our newsprint initiative started in 2017, was to also get comics back on newsstands. We make comics for everyone at Alterna but the sad truth is that comic books aren't as readily available as they used to be.  <strong>Over the past year, we've taken steps to become one of the only publishing companies with newsstand distribution along with traditional comic shop distribution. </strong>We're also working with several dozen comic shop retailers directly to get our comics into their stores on a more consistent basis.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.newsarama.com/36916-newsprint-publisher-alterna-expands-to-toys-r-us-barnes-noble-books-a-million.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>In the holiday season of 2017, we brokered a deal with Toys ""R"" Us which put our comics into their top 200 busiest stores.</strong></a> The chain's days may have been numbered, but the distribution into these stores proved that comics, especially fun and affordable ones, were greatly missed by consumers of all ages. By having our comics in Toys ""R"" Us, several thousand readers became aware of our company and our comics.</p>
<p>Besides things like shipping and reward creation and fulfillment, our $8000 goal will go towards printing the additional comics that we'll need for finalizing our expanded distribution with a few retailers that we've been talking to, as well as pay for a 1 year membership fee for RangeMe. We'll also have stretch goals in place that will help us secure promotional product placements in a variety of stores, enable us to print more comics for more distribution, and will go towards all of the additional supplies that are needed for such an undertaking.</p>
<p>Alterna Comics is run, 99% of the time, by me: Peter Simeti. As the founder, publisher, site designer, merchandise designer, shipping department, graphic designer, prepress department, editor-in-chief, social media manager, marketing and promotions coordinator, president of sales, company accountant, and sometimes the writer, artist, colorist, inker, and letterer on a few books -- I've got a lot going on. SO if we raise enough funds and expand into enough stores, we'll hopefully be able to start hiring employees to help in 2019!</p>

$10,000 STRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED!
EVERY backer gets an ""Alterna Ambassador"" pin!

$12,000 STRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED!
We'll now be ready and able to pitch our comics to several grocery store chains. We'll also donate 500 all ages comics to local libraries in the New England area. EVERY backer gets an Alterna Comics tote bag! 


$18,000 STRETCH GOAL
We'll be able to pay for guaranteed promotional placement in at least two chains as well as purchase an additional four years of membership from RangeMe so that we can continue to expand our comics distribution for years to come. We'll also donate 500 all ages comics to Shriners Hospitals for Children. EVERY backer will get a 4""x4"" die-cut bumper sticker that says ""I SUPPORT MY LOCAL COMIC SHOP!""


$25,000 STRETCH GOAL
We can begin production on marketing materials, promotional items, displays and signage for comic shops that carry Alterna. We'll also send 500 comics to Books for Troops. EVERY backer will get a commemorative 8x10 AlternaWeen print signed by Peter Simeti!

??? = more will be announced if we reach the $25,000 mark
 
AlternaWeen!
For thousands of children this Halloween, it's going to be a fun and interesting day thanks to YOU! By using our all ages and teen appropriate comics as trick or treats, you'll be able to help grow a new generation of comic book readers and creators.  The funds that we raise will go towards expanding our product line into a variety of stores: independent newsstands and convenience stores, grocery stores, dollar stores, and more!
Distribution expansion is an intensive process and can be costly depending on how much product is needed after a store accepts a pitch for product placement. We'll be partnering up with RangeMe to pitch our products to dozens of interested retailers across the world. We already have a few that are interested and the funds we raise will allow us to take the necessary next steps. 


More comics in more places
For those that don't know, Alterna has been around since 2006. We primarily published graphic novels in the first ten years of our existence and in May 2017 we launched a single issue line that featured interiors printed on newsprint. The newsprint is what allows us to have such affordable cover prices while still turning a profit for ourselves and our creators.
Part of our newsprint initiative started in 2017, was to also get comics back on newsstands. We make comics for everyone at Alterna but the sad truth is that comic books aren't as readily available as they used to be.  Over the past year, we've taken steps to become one of the only publishing companies with newsstand distribution along with traditional comic shop distribution. We're also working with several dozen comic shop retailers directly to get our comics into their stores on a more consistent basis.
In the holiday season of 2017, we brokered a deal with Toys ""R"" Us which put our comics into their top 200 busiest stores. The chain's days may have been numbered, but the distribution into these stores proved that comics, especially fun and affordable ones, were greatly missed by consumers of all ages. By having our comics in Toys ""R"" Us, several thousand readers became aware of our company and our comics.
Besides things like shipping and reward creation and fulfillment, our $8000 goal will go towards printing the additional comics that we'll need for finalizing our expanded distribution with a few retailers that we've been talking to, as well as pay for a 1 year membership fee for RangeMe.

SO if we raise enough funds and expand into enough stores, we'll hopefully be able to start hiring employees to help in 2019!

It’s very basic and accessible theory for the beginning revolutionary. <br/><br/>The book will be printed in black and white, as cheaply as possible so more people can get it and use it. There will also be an ebook in full color.<br/><br/>With the funds I raise here, I’ll be able to focus for the next few months on producing this book, without needing to do additional freelance work. If I don't make my goal, I will still take partial funding and produce the book no matter what (and you will still get your rewards). If I receive extra funding, I have more books planned (two books on general revolutionary concepts, and one on essential principles &amp; practices for effective revolutionaries) and any extra funds will help me produce those too!<br/><br/>As an organizer, I often need materials that will help clarify basic concepts, to assist myself and others in understanding this nightmare of a system, as well as to introduce the theories – the guidelines – that could help us end it. We need to fashion our own tools to build a revolutionary movement. I haven't been able to find all materials I need, so I decided to make some myself. If I need them, others might need them too.</p>
<p>For this book, I will combine my skills as a long-time organizer, writer, and award-winning cartoonist (RFK Journalism Award 2012, Society of Professional Journalists' Sigma Delta Chi 2010, Adbusters Creative Resistance Award, among others). I've learned through my 20-year career as a cartoonist (published in hundreds of venues including the <em>Los Angeles Times, South Florida Sun-Sentinel, Daily Beast, Z Magazine</em> and the <em>Occupied Wall Street Journal</em>) that editorial cartoons must be sharp, to-the-point, and easy to understand. Revolutionary theory can be all those things as well. <br/><br/><strong>Topics to be included:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What capitalism is, and what it is not</li>
<li>How capitalism functions: its economic mechanisms and social dynamics</li>
<li>Why capitalism is inherently expansionist</li>
<li>Why war, ecocide and poverty are inevitable effects of capitalism</li>
<li>Why no one – even capitalists themselves-- has the power to make the system more humane or less destructive</li>
<li>What must be done to destroy capitalism</li>
<li>Who is in a position to damage and destroy it, and who are their allies in that struggle</li>
<li>What is the difference between profit and surplus value, and why that is important</li>
<li>Why attacking capitalism’s awful effects is not a viable strategy</li>
<li>What are the structural weaknesses and vulnerabilities in the system</li>
</ul><p>This book is an expanded version of a talk and slide show I gave last year at a day-long event called Earth at Risk, at the University of California at Berkeley, organized by Derrick Jensen, with Arundhati Roy and several other speakers. Many people approached me afterward to ask if I would make the talk widely available. This book is the result.<br/><br/><strong>Here’s some recent reader feedback:</strong><br/><br/>“I like what you’re doing with this series of graphic presentations. Very educational, while still remaining fun to look at.”<br/><em> – Sean Michael Dodd</em><br/><br/>“I look forward to the new cartoons. Sometimes they are revelatory and I perceive a new insight into something I thought I already had a full understanding of. You are able to encapsulate big concepts in succinct and thoughtful ways.” <br/><em> – Duccio</em></p>
<p>""Yours is an especially tough message to hustle -- that all these feel good recycling type things individuals are doing mean nothing if we dont shift systemically. We collectively dont actually want to hear this message, we are trying to dodge it. But then your clever cartoons come along.

<h3><strong>THE MARS CITY VICE WORLD:</strong></h3>
<p>Mars circa 2089, humans live and play alongside various extraterrestrial races. Several planets in our solar system have been colonized for many years. The Moon has sprawling slums, while Mars has become a popular and exclusive theme park based on a super stylized version of 80's Miami. Two unlikely police detectives, a human Maxwell 'Moony' Boone, and his new alien partner Tykar 'Ty' Baths try and overcome their differences, as they work undercover in a fake 1980's Miami investigating a mysterious kingpin that is threatening to corrupt the solar system with a new drug made from a rare alien blood.</p>

<p><strong>Penciler:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Deivid Deon</strong>'s action packed pencils are perfect for our sci-fi world of Mar's City Vice. He is also great at drawing weird aliens! Deivid is a fresh new talent on the professional scene having cut his teeth with indie publishers such as Top Secret press and Meraki. He has always killed deadlines with turning out strong pages on a daily basis.</p>
<p><strong>Inker:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sandro Ribeiro'</strong>s debut happened at Marvel, where he inked some editions of the title Marvel Adventure The Avengers, then went to DC Comics and did work on Teen Titans, Action Comics, Justice League, Green lantern Blackest Night, Red Tornado, Final Crisis Aftermath and others. He has also worked in publishers such as Top Cow, Avatar, valiant and others</p>
<p><strong>Colorist:</strong></p>
<p><strong>James Brown</strong> has spent 25 years in the comics industry. Deadlines met. No excuses. Always in communication with editors and creators. He has worked with such staples of the industry as IDW on their books Transformers and GI Joe A real American Hero.

<p><strong>Letterer:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ed Dukeshir</strong>e is a Harvey-nominated letterer working in the biz since 2001. He has lettered comics from mainstream to creator-owned favorites including Hulk, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, and Shadow Hawk for publishers like Marvel, Boom! Studios, Image and DC Comics.</p>

</div><div>
<p>We want to keep the goals simple and straight forward.  We are using a Flex goal to raise funds meaning all money donated to this campaign will go forward to finishing the remaining 44 pages of Vice Part One. These funds will be for the art team, so they will be able to focus on the book full time. Any funds that go beyond it's completion will be applied to overhead and the production of Mars City Vice part two. The first 21 of the 44 pgs for Part One are completely inked and nearly colored and lettered.</p>

<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>Times are indeed strange for the larger mainstream comic book industry. Diamond Distribution has halted print distribution indefinitely, and comic shops have closed for now. However, that is not affecting self funding indies like us. We already have 21 pages of Vice Part 1 fully inked and just need funds to pay artists to finish the rest. I know the ins and outs of running a transparent and successful social fundraiser. I recently ran a very successful campaign for my board game Secret Unknown Stuff: Escape from Dulce on Kickstarter. I feel that Indiegogo is still the superior platform for books and comics.</p>

<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>Mars City Vice will succeed, but it will do even better if you spread the word to friends on social media. So, please remember that Indiegogo has a sharing tool to do specifically that. Dealing with the recent quarantines and job issues have affected everyone. We have used this time to create and bring you some solid comic book entertainment. It is a great time for indie creators and none of this would be possible without lovers of the medium such as yourself.</p>

Mankind was nearly destroyed. But life was clawed back through science and blood.</p><p>The story is a genre-mixing tale of old and new. It is a science and swordplay adventure on the high seas.

If you're already acquainted with Hans and the rest of the crew and the octopus please scroll down to Issue #3. The StoryThe polar ice caps melted and the oceans rose. Nations were swept away in the deluge. World governments were fractured by war. Corporations filled the void. Millions died. Resources dwindled and flight became a thing of the past. Mankind was nearly destroyed. But life was clawed back through science and blood.The story is a genre-mixing tale of old and new. It is a science and swordplay adventure on the high seas.

And as I've gotten older I began realizing what a great instrument of self expression comics can be. Which brings me to Love's for Suckas.

Like all high school seniors, Eric has it all figured out...until his long-suffering girlfriend decides she's had enough of his shit and breaks up with him. 


With his world turned upside down, Eric decides to win her back because he's changed...seriously for real this time. 

Love's for Suckas follows one guy's quest to understand this crazy thing called love. And along the way, with help from friends, he learns that even though it's tempting to hold on to the past, sometimes you have to let go. And maybe, just maybe he gets what he's after...even if it's not what he thought it would be. 

Although this is generally a very down to earth, grounded in reality story it also contains some fantasy/sci-fi elements peppered throughout. I think this is a fun way to visually represent what the characters are feelings and can set ""Love’s for Suckas"" apart from other stories of its kind.


Ok, so Why am I here? After having worked on Love's for Suckas for over a year and a half, I've finally finished it. I don't mean I finished the outline or the script or even laying down the pencils.

The publisher is small, and they barely have enough to cover the printing costs. There is no advance for me and no marketing budget. I've put this together to get a bit of cash to cover some advertising costs - attending conventions, printing up flyers, that sort of thing. </p><p>I have a couple other means of financial support, but art is what pays Jennie's rent.

It costs a lot to reserve a table at sci fi conventions, comic conventions, and/or Steampunk conventions. Not to mention what getting there costs...have you seen gas prices and airline tickets lately?</p><h4>Any particular conventions, Patricia? </h4><p>Yes, actually! I'll be taking this title to the Steampunk Festival in Gavle, Sweden, to Akon in Dallas, Texas, to Nine Worlds, and to Loncon in London.</p><p>Advertising! Postcards, bookmarks, banners, anything to let people know about Myths of Steam. It's a brand new title, so people need a little convincing if they're going to buy it. I intend to convince them.</p><h3>What Do I Get For My Money?</h3><p>The warm, fuzzy feeling of a good deed and supporting indie comics. Also, stuff. We have everything from commemorative postcards to flash fiction, from a simple thank you to a commissioned portrait.</p><h3>What Is This Comic About?</h3><p>Steampunk Nordic Deities. The big three (Odin, Thor, and Loki) go missing, and their wives enlist Hel, Queen of the Underworld (and Loki's daughter), to find out where they've gone. She journeys to Midgard (Earth) with her stepmother Sigyn. They search every brothel, gambling den, music hall, opera, political arena, ballroom, pub, and sewer they can find.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Eddie Avila, I am a Parson's School of Design graduate.  I have been in the sales industry for the past decade but never lost my love for art, illustration and martial arts.  I began this project 3 years ago and am proud of where it's gotten so far and hope to be able to provide my fellow comic book lovers with an innovative and collectible new comic to fall in love with.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> At this time we are hoping to raise $2000 in order to get issues 1, 2, and 3 colored, bubbled and printed.  We are hoping to be able to have this all done and ready for April in order to ship and start selling! </p>
<p>For pledging we are offering very limited and collectible prints and one of a kind, interactive artwork for specific levels.</p>
<p>Whether we are unable to reach our goal or exceed our goal all funds will be used to finish production on Issues 1, 2, and 3 of ""Day One"", and all pledgers will receive their specific perks.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I believe in this project with all my heart and know once it gets out there for readers they will believe in it also, the story and the world it is set in are relatable to everyone, comic book lover or not.  The 20 years of martial arts experience I have, have allowed me to bring unprecedented scenes to this book that are not found in any other comic out there.</p>
<p>This is not our first campaign, but it's even more important this time around, we have raised over $6600 on Kickstarter making us 130% funded!  What we are hoping for now is to reach even further and be able to print more issues than originally planned to really get us out there!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>In order to minimize risks and challenges that we may face when publishing, we have started our own publishing company, Velocity comics.  We have also copyright and trademarked all materials.  This process started 3 years ago and we felt that tackling these hurdles prior to launching would give us the most efficient outcome.  However, this will be our first time ever printing a comic, that brings some possible issues in itself.  Because we have never printed before we have to do some serious work to ensure proper coloring and quality work to all our pledges and potential fans and we will work tirelessly to do so.  Further questions feel free to contact me at ed@dayonethecomic.com.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
</div><div><p>We understand you may love our project but may not be able to contribute financially, that's not all it's about anyway!  We would love for you to share with friends and family on social media!

We are a small group of independent writers and artists who have a story to tell. It's inspired by the ways that we all as people are faced with challenging circumstances and how there is always something pulling us one way or the other in those times. If you have ever seen the old Looney Tunes cartoons where there's an angel on one shoulder, trying to help the character to do the right thing as well as a demon on the other trying to pull them away from the right thing - that was the initial inspiration for our story. </p><p>    Lucidus is an angel who decides to leave Heaven to return to Earth to help one man in his time of need. David has lost everything he has ever held dear. His wife and daughter were killed in a drunk driving accident right after he returned from the war. But because if his pain and self-destructive ways, he can't see that there is something much larger and far more sinister afoot.</p><p>    Legion has returned to Earth with the goal of possessing all of mankind and opening the gateway between Hell and Earth, and David is one of the few who can help to stop him. Throughout the series David will come to terms with his own pain. He will  learn that the road to redemption is rarely an easy one and that there are many others just like him who need to find that same path.</p><p>     So David and his group of 'degenerates' partner up with a small group of angels who have all left the confines of Heaven to assist mankind in its hour of need.

We are a small group of independent writers and artists who have a story to tell. It's inspired by the ways that we all as people are faced with challenging circumstances and how there is always something pulling us one way or the other in those times. If you have ever seen the old Looney Tunes cartoons where there's an angel on one shoulder, trying to help the character to do the right thing as well as a demon on the other trying to pull them away from the right thing - that was the initial inspiration for our story.     Lucidus is an angel who decides to leave Heaven to return to Earth to help one man in his time of need. David has lost everything he has ever held dear. His wife and daughter were killed in a drunk driving accident right after he returned from the war. But because if his pain and self-destructive ways, he can't see that there is something much larger and far more sinister afoot.    Legion has returned to Earth with the goal of possessing all of mankind and opening the gateway between Hell and Earth, and David is one of the few who can help to stop him. Throughout the series David will come to terms with his own pain. He will  learn that the road to redemption is rarely an easy one and that there are many others just like him who need to find that same path.     So David and his group of 'degenerates' partner up with a small group of angels who have all left the confines of Heaven to assist mankind in its hour of need. Lucidus and her angelic friends will aid David and his group to stop an evil of Biblical proportions from achieving its sinister goals.    But as much as we have enjoyed working on this project so far, we have taken it as far as we can on our own. We need your help to continue Lucidus and David's story. Because of the generosity and faith of our core group of friends and fans, we were able to not only release the origins issue, but SELL OUT of the first print run.     In addition to what their generosity allowed us to do, it also gave us the opportunity to work with a legend in the Comic Book industry, Bart Sears. Bart and his team at Ominous Studios in Florida created an amazing cover for the origin issue as well as an alternate version for promotional posters. The folks at Ominous were instrumental in getting us started down the right path and we are forever grateful to them for all their help.     But now we turn to you.

We would love to see our characters grow and continue to tell their story to an audience that we already have, as well as to any new friends we might make along the way.

The only risk is delays, however, they will be minimal as all the artwork is done, we only need to do the letters and print.",9.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>One Wacky Idea! </h3>
<p>So was playing Worms Armageddon with my brothers, and couple of shows were awfully popular at the time: Attack on Titan (which is still awesome), and The Walking Dead (I sure do love that first season). And while my wormy minion, in his dapper hat grappled from his ninja rope, and flung dynamite at his enemies, I though, ""What if they fought giant zombies?""</p>

<h3>Then My Favorite Beer Turned Into a Plague!</h3>
<p>I'd been up north so long, I forgot what the place I was renting looked like! And I thought, boy if work slows down, I need to fly somewhere and see more of this world. Sure enough, it slowed down-but sure not enough! I came back to a world that wouldn't let me go anywhere! Even the bars shut down. Welp. I can entertain myself while isolated in a truck, so it's business as usual. The comic was already drawn up, and just needed a cover and some letters. I live-streamed the cover, made some internet friends, did the lettering myself too and got it printed. How's my spelling at 2AM? Only the ones who buy the FIRST EDITION will find out! </p>

<p>Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, The Little Mermaid, Rapunzel…I’m sure you recognize those Princesses , you know their stories and  you know how those stories end, or at least how they ended according to their modern retelling. <strong>They lived happily ever after </strong>or something like that. </p>
<p>Our Princess however isn’t that kind of Princess and her stories are not those kind of story.  The Princess Lucinda short film tells the story of our precocious, bratty and magical princess as she visits a park and runs into a little girl in need of her special kind of help. But our Princess isn't the helpful sort, so what happens next is wicked good fun and  a wicked good short film.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://channelmlive.com/kickstarter/1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our film’s screenplay is written by<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/TheImagineer"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Malcolm Harris</a>, an award winning graphic novelist  and the writer of the Princess Lucinda graphic novel.  Malcolm will  also direct the project and will bring the same style and uniqueness of the book to the screen as only someone who understands the world and character on such a personal level can. </p>
<p>The film itself will be shot in Dallas ,Texas and will do its best to support the local and growing film industry by using the best production and post-production crew that city has to offer.   </p>
<p>Once done, the film will not only be shown at various fandom conventions, but  at film festivals.  Our goal is not only to entertain and bring a unique character to a wider audience,  but to inspire  other independent comic company like Princess Lucinda’s <a href=""http://www.channelmlive.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Channel M Publishing</a>,  to do the same and bring their characters to life on film and show the world that there is more too graphic novels and films based on them than testosterone driven costumed superheroes like those found in the <strong>Avengers</strong> and <strong>Dark Knight</strong>. </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://channelmlive.com/kickstarter/3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span>So why do we need your help?  Simply put, Princess Lucinda is the story of a magical Princess, with the emphasis being, “magic”.  Funds gained via this crowdfunding will go towards Production and post production.  We want a movie that is more than just a glorified “Fan Film”, we wants something that  will look just as good as the other “comic book films.”. </span></p>

</div>
<div class=""template asset"">To make that happen we’ve found a great actress to play Princess Lucinda.  We’ve gotten award winning camera people and production folk ready to go once we have the finances to get them all together and get this film moving towards its summer 2013 premier.  </div>
<div class=""template asset"">
<p> To put it plainly you’ll be helping out with:</p>
<ul>
<li>The providing a professional film crew and look to the film</li>
<li>Effects and video post production</li>
<li>Local permits</li>
<li>Bringing talent from across the country to Texas to film.</li>
<li>Costumes by <a href=""http://www.firefly-path.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Firefly path</a>
</li>
<li>And if we go over the budget with pledges  the funds will go towards improving the production. Not a dime will be wasted as we do our very best to produce the very best. </li>

</div></div>","""...I think these stories have more in common with the kind of dark whimsical books for kids they don’t make anymore. Roland Dahl (Charlie and the Chocolate factory, The Witches and James and the Giant Peach) comes to mind...""  -Comicvine.com-Review of Princess Lucinda issue 0 ""We all know the world of Disney Princesses….sunshine, rainbows, unicorns and all that crap. Now, imagine a world that turns that on its head – the very antithesis of the Disney Princesses…and you’ve found Princess Lucinda..."" Comicosity.com
 

Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, The Little Mermaid, Rapunzel…I’m sure you recognize those Princesses , you know their stories and  you know how those stories end, or at least how they ended according to their modern retelling. They lived happily ever after or something like that. 
Our Princess however isn’t that kind of Princess and her stories are not those kind of story.  The Princess Lucinda short film tells the story of our precocious, bratty and magical princess as she visits a park and runs into a little girl in need of her special kind of help. But our Princess isn't the helpful sort, so what happens next is wicked good fun and  a wicked good short film.

Our film’s screenplay is written by Malcolm Harris, an award winning graphic novelist  and the writer of the Princess Lucinda graphic novel.  Malcolm will  also direct the project and will bring the same style and uniqueness of the book to the screen as only someone who understands the world and character on such a personal level can. 
The film itself will be shot in Dallas ,Texas and will do its best to support the local and growing film industry by using the best production and post-production crew that city has to offer.   
Once done, the film will not only be shown at various fandom conventions, but  at film festivals.  Our goal is not only to entertain and bring a unique character to a wider audience,  but to inspire  other independent comic company like Princess Lucinda’s Channel M Publishing,  to do the same and bring their characters to life on film and show the world that there is more too graphic novels and films based on them than testosterone driven costumed superheroes like those found in the Avengers and Dark Knight. 

So why do we need your help?  Simply put, Princess Lucinda is the story of a magical Princess, with the emphasis being, “magic”.  Funds gained via this crowdfunding will go towards Production and post production.  We want a movie that is more than just a glorified “Fan Film”, we wants something that  will look just as good as the other “comic book films.”. 
 

 

To make that happen we’ve found a great actress to play Princess Lucinda.  We’ve gotten award winning camera people and production folk ready to go once we have the finances to get them all together and get this film moving towards its summer 2013 premier.  

 To put it plainly you’ll be helping out with:

The providing a professional film crew and look to the film
Effects and video post production
Local permits
Bringing talent from across the country to Texas to film.
Costumes by Firefly path

And if we go over the budget with pledges  the funds will go towards improving the production. Not a dime will be wasted as we do our very best to produce the very best. 

 After talking to all involved we've come to the current minimum budget, thanks to many of the people involved taking on this project as a labor of love.

Most films have a separate promotion budget.  We don’t have that.That means it’s really up to you and existing Channel M websites, Princess Lucinda graphic novel fans and social-networking pages to help get the word out.
 So please,  tell your family and friends, tweet about us , Hand out our special ""Obey the Princess Flyers"" and show the world the most valuable resource for a project like this are people who care about and who are willing to take a few minutes out of their day to help promote it.
Also, please  take the time to subscribe to us  on Facebook and  join us onTwitter  Those are the best way to not only keep updated on this project but to a great way to ask questions about it.   And if you have questions not covered there or you want to help or have ideas drop us a line at   princesslucinda.movie@channelmlive.com

For those that pledge, we're offering some great insensitive ranging from the digital versions of the production, graphic novels and parts in the film.   Also available will be a DVD copy of the film (If we get extra funds that will change into a Blu-Ray)  that includes.

<p>In a nutshell, PunchLine is like Jessica Jones training Buffy Summers.</p>
<p>PunchLine starts when Mel, a costumed hero, is forced into retirement and to pass her responsibilities along to a young girl named Jessie. To add insult to injury, Mel is ordered to stick around to train her replacement. During training, Jessie starts to question Mel's drive and instincts.</p>
<p>PunchLine has been shopped to a few publishers, but we have never found a deal that was just right. We're still talking to publishers, and in the mean time, we'd like to deliver our little comic to the people that don't read comics online or on their phone.</p>
<p>Industry veteran Bill Williams has written for DC Comics, IDW and more. More recently, he inked a chapter of the <a href=""https://www.comixology.com/Batman-66-Meets-Wonder-Woman-77-2016-2017-11/digital-comic/508288"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Batman '66 Meets Wonder Woman '77</a> comic.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking for comic book fans.</p>
<p>We are shipping signed hard covers and signed trade paperback editions of the first long story arc, Blood Sisters. That story runs 124 pages. This edition will also have a cover gallery and a few pages of sketch book material for a page count of 140+.</p>
<p>We're also shipping out T-shirts.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE-</strong> Matthew has created a couple of PUNCHLINE wallpapers thanks to contributor requests. They're on his Deviant Art page. You can find them <a href=""https://www.deviantart.com/kashdv8/art/Punchline-Comic-WALLPAPER-754111799"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HERE (#1)</a> and <a href=""https://www.deviantart.com/kashdv8/art/Punchline-Comic-WALLPAPER-754111482"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HERE (#2)</a>. While you're there, poke around and get a look at the rest of his awesome art. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Matthew Weldon (artist) and Bill Williams (writer) are long time comic book creators. This is our first project together.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are past the half-way point on the story. Of the 124 pages scripted, only 30 remain to be penciled and inked.</p>
<p>We are committed to doing a print run of the book. Any dollars we can't crowdsource will come right from us. While we can buck it ourselves, we'd rather deliver the comics to the fans on a direct basis.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
In a nutshell, PunchLine is like Jessica Jones training Buffy Summers.
PunchLine starts when Mel, a costumed hero, is forced into retirement and to pass her responsibilities along to a young girl named Jessie. To add insult to injury, Mel is ordered to stick around to train her replacement. During training, Jessie starts to question Mel's drive and instincts.
PunchLine has been shopped to a few publishers, but we have never found a deal that was just right. We're still talking to publishers, and in the mean time, we'd like to deliver our little comic to the people that don't read comics online or on their phone.
Industry veteran Bill Williams has written for DC Comics, IDW and more. More recently, he inked a chapter of the Batman '66 Meets Wonder Woman '77 comic.

What We Need & What You Get
We are looking for comic book fans.
We are shipping signed hard covers and signed trade paperback editions of the first long story arc, Blood Sisters. That story runs 124 pages. This edition will also have a cover gallery and a few pages of sketch book material for a page count of 140+.
We're also shipping out T-shirts.
UPDATE- Matthew has created a couple of PUNCHLINE wallpapers thanks to contributor requests. They're on his Deviant Art page. You can find them HERE (#1) and HERE (#2). While you're there, poke around and get a look at the rest of his awesome art. 

The Impact
Matthew Weldon (artist) and Bill Williams (writer) are long time comic book creators. This is our first project together.


Risks & Challenges
We are past the half-way point on the story. Of the 124 pages scripted, only 30 remain to be penciled and inked.
We are committed to doing a print run of the book. Any dollars we can't crowdsource will come right from us. While we can buck it ourselves, we'd rather deliver the comics to the fans on a direct basis.


Other Ways You Can Help
If you don't have the cash to buy a book, there are ways you can help us fund our project. Sharing via social media is free and appreciated.
It won't hurt our feelings a bit if you go check out the comics on a digital distribution site like comiXology or Drive Thru Comics.
And Finally For Our Fans Outside of the US...

<h3>The TV Documentary<br/>
</h3>
<p>In her 10  years career, Drakaina has always been keen on sharing her experiences as a living Muse with her fans, through books and on her website, when she was meeting them at conventions or simply by chatting with them on her social media pages. Yet a part of the puzzle was missing: it's different to hear about a convention or a modeling experience  and  living it, with the work and stress it involves as well as the  behind the scenes work, the joys, the doubts, the frustrations it takes to actually get to that point, the final result that the fans get to see. So when the opportunity of making a TV documentary based on her Journey, Drakaina didn't think twice and dove into it. What better way for Drakaina to share the experience with her fans than to take them with her on the -sometimes bumpy- road to success? A production company jumped on board and gave her a HD camera for her to capture her appearance at the San Diego comic con on film. But it's hard to both film yourself and what's going on around you when you are on your own, both actor and film maker (the angles, the lights etc ... not necessarily the best for what she is trying to achieve). Now the opportunity to get more convention footage arises and this time Drakaina would like to take a small 2 men camera crew with her to help her out and get a better quality footage. Problem is the convention is in 17 days, which doesn't leave her lots of time to raise money for the trip...

While Xan has been able to keep up with the costs of the web hosting, he will be unable to keep this podcast going once the podcasting computer fails.</p><p>But you can help</p><ul>
<li>I've hosted the Spiraken Manga Review and Spiraken Movie Review Podcasts since 2008, providing over 400 episodes and over 240,000 minutes of entertaining audio reviews, delivered free of charge .</li>
<li>By Funding this project, you'll allow me to produce at least another 5 years worth of content with higher quality and more frequency than before. That means more insanity, more informative reviews and more Wheel of Manga.</li>
</ul><p>Be it a new Microphone, a replacement computer or a new Wheel of Manga, anything to help will be appreciated.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Promises Promises Promises</h3><p>This is where I promise not to spend your contributions and donations on Jet Skis and other frivolous purchases:</p><ul>
<li>In order to keep Our Podcast going, we need to purchase a replacement computer (around $325), 2 replacement microphones ($125 after taxes) and an updated sound mixer  (about $100). The goal of this project ($600) will cover the cost of the needed items as well as the IndieGoGo commission fee.</li>
<li>In the unlikely event of an overage, All remaining funds will be used to pay for  more manga and movies of amazing and terrible quality to put on the Wheel of manga and Dodecahydron of movies to potentially review in a future episode of the podcast. </li>
<li>In the likely event of incomplete funding, I'll still use whatever money that has been raised to assist in purchasing the things needed to keep this podcast afloat. I'm not looking to make a profit, but rather trying to keep this podcast going and be able to keep providing fun content for fans new and old.</li>

</ul><p></p><p>And that’s all there is to it.</p></div>","Here's The NewsWhat once was a theraputic outlet for two geeks named May and Xan, has turned into 6 years of informative, entertaining and insane review podcasts about Manga, Anime, Video Games, Conventions and novels of unique quality. With no funding from Big Corporations or government assistant, Alexander ""Xan"" Villanueva, host of the Various Review Podcasts found at www.spiraken.com has kept the podcast going with a twinkle in his eye and a computer that is still running Windows XP and malfunctioning microphones.However due to the high cost of replacement equipment, This entertaining podcast may come to an end due to a dying computer and constantly failing microphones. While Xan has been able to keep up with the costs of the web hosting, he will be unable to keep this podcast going once the podcasting computer fails.But you can help
I've hosted the Spiraken Manga Review and Spiraken Movie Review Podcasts since 2008, providing over 400 episodes and over 240,000 minutes of entertaining audio reviews, delivered free of charge .
By Funding this project, you'll allow me to produce at least another 5 years worth of content with higher quality and more frequency than before. That means more insanity, more informative reviews and more Wheel of Manga.
Be it a new Microphone, a replacement computer or a new Wheel of Manga, anything to help will be appreciated.Promises Promises PromisesThis is where I promise not to spend your contributions and donations on Jet Skis and other frivolous purchases:
In order to keep Our Podcast going, we need to purchase a replacement computer (around $325), 2 replacement microphones ($125 after taxes) and an updated sound mixer  (about $100). The goal of this project ($600) will cover the cost of the needed items as well as the IndieGoGo commission fee.
In the unlikely event of an overage, All remaining funds will be used to pay for  more manga and movies of amazing and terrible quality to put on the Wheel of manga and Dodecahydron of movies to potentially review in a future episode of the podcast. 
In the likely event of incomplete funding, I'll still use whatever money that has been raised to assist in purchasing the things needed to keep this podcast afloat. I'm not looking to make a profit, but rather trying to keep this podcast going and be able to keep providing fun content for fans new and old.

<b>Mac and Trouble</b> are real-life house cats, my best friends actually.</div>
<div>They're very comical, and have hysterical personalities, so it wasn't hard to imagine them with human characteristics and mannerisms... and eventually, their own comic book.</div>
<div>Mac was born with an ailment called ""Cerebellar Hypoplasia"" (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellar_hypoplasia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellar_hypoplasia</a>)which causes him to have problems with his movements and he becomes very uncoordinated. He often has a problem walking, and at times falls down. He really can't jump or run, due to these problems as well.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Trouble was a kitten that came right after Mac. He's larger than most cats, a little clumsy, but an all-around best friend to the others... whether they want it or not LOL<br/>Trouble and Mac got along famously right from the start, giving Mac the only playmate he's ever really known. They eat and often sleep together, and, you really can't think of one without the other.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><i>AND THEY BOTH LOVE CHEESE !</i></div>

<br/>For years, I had been working in the comic book industry as a writer and artist... but over time I developed a nerve problem with my back and hip that causes me a lot of pain. As such, I had to stop attending comic shows and eventually stayed in my bed or chair. The idea to re-enter comics hit me last year. Since then, I've worked on some really nice comic and art jobs for others, but nothing for myself.</div>

Mac and Trouble are real-life house cats, my best friends actually.
They're very comical, and have hysterical personalities, so it wasn't hard to imagine them with human characteristics and mannerisms... and eventually, their own comic book.
Mac was born with an ailment called ""Cerebellar Hypoplasia"" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellar_hypoplasia)which causes him to have problems with his movements and he becomes very uncoordinated. He often has a problem walking, and at times falls down. He really can't jump or run, due to these problems as well.

Trouble was a kitten that came right after Mac. He's larger than most cats, a little clumsy, but an all-around best friend to the others... whether they want it or not LOLTrouble and Mac got along famously right from the start, giving Mac the only playmate he's ever really known. They eat and often sleep together, and, you really can't think of one without the other.

AND THEY BOTH LOVE CHEESE !


Mac (left) and Trouble - press shots LOL
For years, I had been working in the comic book industry as a writer and artist... but over time I developed a nerve problem with my back and hip that causes me a lot of pain. As such, I had to stop attending comic shows and eventually stayed in my bed or chair. The idea to re-enter comics hit me last year. Since then, I've worked on some really nice comic and art jobs for others, but nothing for myself.

This time, it's for me... for something I care about :)


The Adventures Of Mac And Trouble

Mac and Trouble are average house cats who fall through a wormhole in their litterbox and land in the middle of the Nexus of realities. But... was it an accident, or were they meant to be there ? Only the evil Professor Wormhole knows for sure.The 'Nexus' is a place outside of space-time, where a mysterious group known as the 'Collectors' base their operations. For all intent and purpose, it appears that they're operating out of a Movie Studio filled with all sorts of amazing characters and props, that interact with reality.During their adventures, you will meet all sorts of characters on their comedic travel through the universe... some familiar, some not. Among them, long lost heroes, movie monsters, and historical figures to name a few, on a wild journey of the absurd.




The earliest design - art by Michael Mayne.

The best way to describe their story is to look back to the Bob Hope/Bing Crosby 'road pictures' (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_to_%E2%80%A6)... the Marx Bros... and a little ""Family Guy"". We're looking at great fun and high adventure much like the ""Disney Afternoon"", ""Duck Tales"", and ""Tale Spin"".Comics such as ""Cerebus the Aardvark"", ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"", and ""Howard the Duck"" are major influences to the style of the book. The mix of 'funny animals' into 'real world' situations is key to the development... but in this case, we're utilizing time-travel and alternate reality hopping to set the scene.

To start, this is not intended to be a 'normal' comic book property. Mac and Trouble are intended to be shown in a few different different formats.
In their anthropomorphic forms, Mac and Trouble are seen in their own sci-fi comic adventures... and work has already begun on showing the cats as normal cats in newspaper comic strips.



One of the first strips Michael Mayne and I created, displaying Mac and Trouble in their 'house cat' form.

In the future, a special issue is planned collecting the comic mis-adventures of the cats in 'funny animal' style shorts, and, companion ashcan books, called 'Litterboxes' will provide extra adventures and behind-the-scenes content.

Some of these Litterbox Editions will contain cross-overs with other publishers, often showing lighter sides and unique version of their characters. As such, a few publishers are welcoming the crossovers and have already agreed to the new 'tails'.

Added to the fun of the book - a special website address will be hidden among the art in issue #1, which will direct the reader to a page of special art, games, and assorted fun. There will be more hidden features like this as time goes on as well.

Our Story, Their Story, Etc


At this time, Rusty Ink! (my new studio name) is looking to fund Mac and Trouble in it's various presences... the comic book, the ashcan supplement, and news strip formats. I'm hoping to one day take this property to a higher level and extend it into other forms of entertainment as well.



Mac and Trouble have already appeared on two signed promotional convention posters for the Pheonix Comicon and the Southwest Toy and Comic show.

They've been featured in 4 trading card sets so far: The March of Dimes card set (5Finity), the CBLDF set (Cryptozoic), the Island Dreams card set (Holylands.com), and the Red Angel promo set (WTF Comics).

In addition, they have their own promotional set which features 3 base cards, and, 1 original art sketch card per set. These sketch cards include works by some of the hottest stars in the sketch card industry, as well as special cards to include: Paw-print cards from the actual cats, signature cards from the artists & writers, Instant Win cards for personal sketches, and more ! (This item is being offered as a reward at right)




The 3-card Mac and Trouble promo set - each set comes with an original art sketch card.

The Impact

Achieving this goal would mean the world to me - and will allow funding for our first 3-issue story arc. Whatever funds are collected will go towards payments to the artists and the overall production of the book.
Once in print, we intend to donate a portion of the profits to various animal charities throughout the United States. My intent is share whatever good fortune that comes our way.

Once in print, ""The Adventures Of Mac And Trouble"" will feature public service ads for various animal charities and help with animal fundraising events as well.

""I plan on continuing with this project for as long as I can, in the best way I know how. It means something to me. I would sincerely appreciate any investments that I can get, no matter how small, to help me bring this project to reality... and in the end, it will further help me with my health problems.

</h3>We need funds of around £300 to help us put on shows, predominantly.

<p><strong>WHO AM I?</strong></p>
<p>My name is Rene Cordova. I’m a Mexican artist from Guadalajara. My whole life has been dedicated to my drawings (wife gotta hate!!!), comics and animation in my home country, and the past five years have been working for a Mexican animation studio (Metacube).</p>
<p>I have been published in titles like “The Darksiders Tribute” from Udon, ""Republika Lucha"" from Chidoware, the Mexican blockbuster “Soulkeepers” from Fixia Studio, the compendium “Un Mexicano en cada hijo te dió” and others. I have worked for Televisa Press, as well as Metacube Animation studios designing characters and directing for soon-to-be-released animated movies such as “Noche de Muertos” and “Republika Lucha”.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>WHAT I´M DOING?</strong></p>
<p>I have always drawn, everywhere, every hour, and I´m blessed to be surrounded by super hyper mega talented artists from Mexico and the Americas. Now, I found myself with enough material to share it with you all. So, I am preparing an amazing book with all-original artwork, full of beautiful ladies, zombies and lots cool stuff. Because with great drawings come a great art book, right?</p>
<p>I’m a Facebook/Deviant junkie. Truly, can´t help myself. Some of work in progress has been posted only as cameo of finished work for my art book. Check my <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/rene.cordova.5680"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> and <a href=""http://renecordova.deviantart.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Deviant</a> sites for a quick preview of art to come, as well as illustrations I have done for work and fun.  Don´t you worry, there is still plenty of original work inside the Book, I am on top of it. :)</p>

Rayner, along with his compatriots Biffy Dunderdale, Oleda  Marchand, and American war hero Henry Johnson, thwarted Maria Rasputin and the Black Hand’s plans. The Black Hand disappeared into the shadows… and regrouped.Now, in the spring of 1920, in a world rife with black magic, horrific monsters, and dieselpunk technology, creatures commanded by the Black Hand are rampaging across Eastern Europe, moving ever westward. Maria Rasputin still seeks vengeance for Rayner’s assassination of her father. Black Hand sorcerers Lihko and Koschei have allied themselves with the fascists of the Viking League, spreading terror. A mysterious Teutonic Knight has appeared, his goals and alliances unknown. And the great beast known only as The Baubus waits to be unleashed.The acclaimed creative team of creator/sculptor Paul Harding, writer Ron Marz, and artist Matthew Dow Smith are reuniting for Beasts of the Black Hand Volume 2. They are joined by colorist Nanjan Jamberi and letterer Troy Peteri as they bring to life the next chapter of this thrilling tale. As with the first volume, the sequel is presented in a deluxe, oversize hardcover package, featuring 64 pages of story and art. Expect more monsters, more magic, and more mayhem as the Beasts are unleashed once again!                                      Best known for his work as a sculptor of statues and action figures for clients including DC Collectibles, Gentle Giant, and Sideshow, Paul Harding is giving full vent to his imagination as the creator and concept artist of Beasts of the Black Hand.    A veteran of the comics industry, writer Ron Marz has worked for every major publisher, including Marvel, DC, Dark Horse, IDW, and Image.

<h2>Help us bring the first (and only) successful ongoing comic book featuring an all-female team of super heroines BACK to FULL COLOR (digital, on glossy paper) in December of 2019, as series creator BILL BLACK returns to write and be a part of the art team!!</h2>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<p>My name is Mark G. Heike, and I have been working in the comic book profession ( in one role or another) since 1980.  I've freelanced (as a penciler) on titles like Aliens vs. Predator, X-men, Mantra; inked on Star Wars:Tales of the Jedi, TMNT, Magneto, She-Hulk, Man Against Time and others. I started contributing (as a penciler) to Bill Black's Paragon Publications  in 1980, continued when Bill launched Americomics (soon changed to AC Comics) in 1983, and became Associate Editor at AC in 1990. When Bill decided to step away from day-to-day involvement with the publishing end of AC Comics ( to pursue making films full-time) in 2014, he named me Editor In Chief at AC.  I also collaborated with Bill (as penciler) on the historic Femforce Special #1 in 1984, as well as the launch of the ongoing series, Femforce  in 1985. <br/>  We realize that  some of you may not be familiar with FEMFORCE or AC COMICS. Because of that , some explanation (and history) may be in order.</p>
<p><br/>  AC Comics is the brainchild of dynamic artist/writer/editor/publisher/producer/director Bill Black. A lifelong comics and film fanatic, Bill began producing his legendary PARAGON PUBLICATIONS line of ""ground level"" periodicals in 1969 as a spare-time project as he advanced in his career in advertising and educational film production.  Titles like PARAGON PRESENTS, PARAGON SUPERHEROES, FEM FANTASTIQUE, BIZARRE THRILLS and others  featured  comic-style stories of his own original characters like The SHADE, SCARLET SCORPION, CAPTAIN PARAGON, SYNN- The Girl From LSD and others, written and drawn by Bill  and a number of his enthusiastic and talented friends.  Long before comic shops existed, Bill sold these books via mail order from ads placed in contemporary fanzines of the day, with several of the titles boasting circulations well into the thousands  by the end of the line's historic run. Despite the high number of PARAGON  books circulated, they are now hard to find, highly-priced collector's items. Many of Bill's PARAGON heroes and heroines eventually became important characters in the AC COMICS line, appearing as part of FEMFORCE and in other titles to this day.</p>

<p><br/>   When business conditions and technology indicated that it was time to try out color comics at AC  once again in 2019, it was a ""no brainer"" that the perennially-popular FEMFORCE characters  should be the stars of the first title, so we developed a new comic book, titled  SUPERBABES, as we wanted to lauch a color FEMFORCE comic book WITHOUT initially interfering with the regular ongoing FEMFORCE quarterly title which would continue on that schedule.

<p><br/>   The enthusiastic response we got to SUPERBABES #1 led us to think that it could be a MISTAKE to maintain FF as a black and white book  any longer than we had to, so we decided to fast-track our plan to go full color on FEMFORCE ASAP; which would mean FEMFORCE #188, scheduled for December of this year. When we told Bill about this plan, he was so excited he immediately volunteered to jump an board to be the WRITER and INKER on the new all-color FEMFORCE!!

The lead story for FEMFORCE #188 would be by the creative team of Black and Coile ( Which will feature the return of long-time nemesis ALIZARIN CRIMSON, and clear up the long-running mystery of NIGHTVEIL's missing Cloak of Darkness), but that's not all! The book would ALSO feature a a back-up NIGHTVEIL story co-starring The SENTINELS of JUSTICE, written AND drawn by Bill Black himself!!</p>
<p><br/>   The only thing that stood in the way of proceeding full speed ahead was production costs on a second color book.  Cautiously optomistic as we were with the sales numbers on Superbabes #1 (AC's first all-digital color comic book) we had used up all of our available capital getting THAT book into production. If we had to wait to accumulate enough funding out of the sales of additional issues of SUPERBABES to put out a color FEMFORCE, it might take us several YEARS to do that, even if SUPERBABES continues as self-supporting. By that time, conditions in the comic book industry might no longer be favorable  for a color FF. So, we've decided to look to YOU, the fans and readers for financing. If you can help us get this historic back-to-color issue off the ground, we feel confident that the response to it in the direct-sales market will allow the title to support itself , hopefully for another 30-plus years (at least!) as a full-color, state-of-the art publication, and turn this already historic and important independent comic book title into something chromatically spectacular!!</p>

</div></div>","Help us bring the first (and only) successful ongoing comic book featuring an all-female team of super heroines BACK to FULL COLOR (digital, on glossy paper) in December of 2019, as series creator BILL BLACK returns to write and be a part of the art team!!
 

My name is Mark G. Heike, and I have been working in the comic book profession ( in one role or another) since 1980.  I've freelanced (as a penciler) on titles like Aliens vs. Predator, X-men, Mantra; inked on Star Wars:Tales of the Jedi, TMNT, Magneto, She-Hulk, Man Against Time and others. I started contributing (as a penciler) to Bill Black's Paragon Publications  in 1980, continued when Bill launched Americomics (soon changed to AC Comics) in 1983, and became Associate Editor at AC in 1990. When Bill decided to step away from day-to-day involvement with the publishing end of AC Comics ( to pursue making films full-time) in 2014, he named me Editor In Chief at AC.  I also collaborated with Bill (as penciler) on the historic Femforce Special #1 in 1984, as well as the launch of the ongoing series, Femforce  in 1985.   We realize that  some of you may not be familiar with FEMFORCE or AC COMICS. Because of that , some explanation (and history) may be in order.
  AC Comics is the brainchild of dynamic artist/writer/editor/publisher/producer/director Bill Black. A lifelong comics and film fanatic, Bill began producing his legendary PARAGON PUBLICATIONS line of ""ground level"" periodicals in 1969 as a spare-time project as he advanced in his career in advertising and educational film production.  Titles like PARAGON PRESENTS, PARAGON SUPERHEROES, FEM FANTASTIQUE, BIZARRE THRILLS and others  featured  comic-style stories of his own original characters like The SHADE, SCARLET SCORPION, CAPTAIN PARAGON, SYNN- The Girl From LSD and others, written and drawn by Bill  and a number of his enthusiastic and talented friends.  Long before comic shops existed, Bill sold these books via mail order from ads placed in contemporary fanzines of the day, with several of the titles boasting circulations well into the thousands  by the end of the line's historic run. Despite the high number of PARAGON  books circulated, they are now hard to find, highly-priced collector's items. Many of Bill's PARAGON heroes and heroines eventually became important characters in the AC COMICS line, appearing as part of FEMFORCE and in other titles to this day.
   When the burgeoning direct-sales comic book market began to take off in the early 1980's, Bill decided to ""take the plunge"" and debuted a full-color comic book line he dubbed ""AMERICOMICS"" (soon shortened to AC COMICS) in January of 1983, as one of the first four color comic book lines to pioneer the then-new comic book store distribution system. His flagship AMERICOMICS title, along with FUN COMICS, BLACK DIAMOND and others made a pretty big splash among  comic book readers of the day, but a tidal wave of hastily-produced comics rushed out by dozens of ""fly-by-night"" publishers soon created a glut of independent comics on the market that drove a number of distributors and retailers out of business and required a re-thinking of the AC line by late 1984.

As a frequently asked guest at European cons, he has managed to stand out with his macabre style and eye for detail. Soon he will be completing his <i>Virus-anthology</i> of zombie-comics, alongside other projects, finding his way to an ever growing fan base.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Thys</strong> has published three collections of short stories so far. He is praised for his bizarre imagination and the ability to blend genres such as horror, dark fantasy and humor into compelling tales about the decay of both body and mind. At a very young age, he got mesmerized by the magic of horror movies, dreaming that someday he would be a screenwriter. Building nightmares for this chilling anthology series, comes pretty close.</p>

Greed

Greed expands the world as we know it with stories and events from the alternate world that are filled with macabre yet comical tales, and heart-wrenching moments. 
Greed is a world of gods and demons, tales of theology, and campfire stories. It takes place in a small town that has a lot going on below the surface.

Everything you've heard about religion is true except it's a realm where Hades and Lucifer share Hell; a place where Christ, Odin, and Zeus debate your fate, and lesser gods and demons traverse a landscape that is identical to our own.
Oh, my friends... Only a thin veil separates us from them. 
Meet Oz, a 10-year old suburban youth who meets Kayde, the monster under his bed. With increasing levels of terror that visit them in the night, their adventures begin with a SMASH!

<h3>Micro Mob a unique Twitter event</h3>
<p>Over the last month we've come together to do something very special. We created a Mob of people expressing their support to everybody coping with cancer. The Mob is an A3 drawing comprising over 1,400 tiny individual, unique, toon characters holding up the Twitter name of each Mobster.<b> Stephen Fry, Ricky Gervais, Jonathan Ross,</b> plus over 30 other well known people are in there too.</p>
<p>The Mob was a spur of the moment thing that ran away with itself because hundreds of wonderful people made it happen. We aimed to raise awareness and raise cash. We've done the awareness now it's time to make a real difference. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Every penny of profit will be shared between 3hundredand65's three charities: Teenage Cancer Trust, Cyclists Fighting Cancer and When you Wish Upon a Star</p>
<p>During the making of the mob I lost someone very special to me and the world lost Jon Brookes. I dedicate Micro Mob to Cath and Jon, you can dedicate your print to anyone you choose - the mob is for everybody coping with cancer.</p>

<div><p>Our Indiegogo campaign is the kick off to our press release and advertising campaign as well. When funded we plan on using the capital to grow our fan base by advertising in cannabis based magazines, pop culture magazines, radio, billboard, and internet. We will be attending the Cannabis Cup  and Comic con events. We will add to our existing product line ie; pothead bobble heads, t-shirts, plush dolls, hats, etc... We have several apps available and are currently developing more. Our goal is to build our fan base while selling our merchandise to raise funds for the production of an animated cartoon series. When the production of the cartoon is complete we will have the fan base to support it. Thank you very much for checking us out. We hope you enjoy the products from your donation.</p></div>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>We currently have an awesome team comprised of a webmaster, an app designer, social media director, the original artist, an internet advertising agent, a 3-D animation graphic designer and ourselves. We have been involved in the industry for many years and our affiliates in the cannabis industry are there for the advertising.The main stream media is portraying cannabis to be more excepted in the medical community as well as for recreational. We don't think about if our cartoon will be liked or excepted. We are more concerned about getting the right voices for the cartoons and details of the project.

<p>Hey supporters and fans of The Potheadz! Thank you very much for taking the time to check out our  Indiegogo page. We are Potsie and Jamie the creators of The funniest, coolest, adult cartoon The Pot Headz. You have never seen a cartoon like this in your life and you never will again. We are very close to fulfilling an eighteen year long journey and dream. With your support, together we can make our dream a reality in 2015 by bringing our characters to life.</p>
<p>The cartoon first started as a way for us to make money while having fun writing jokes with our friends. We had no idea idea what we were doing but we learned as we went and have been educated by trial and error rather than a college education. Not only did we need to create the characters and material, we had to learn the laws and business side of the industry step by step. We had to protect ourselves from sharks a few times that were attempting to copy and steal our cartoon, but for the most part we have been greeted with open arms every step of the way. The library of congress put us on hold several times during a phone conversation so several people in the office could tell us how much they love the cartoon and they are rooting for us.</p>
<p>As time went on and the cartoon progressed so did the motivation behind the production of the cartoon. The next phase or motivational drive was we wanted to put our stamp on the marijuana entertainment industry. We love Cheech and Chong. They are the pioneers of pot entertainment that paved the way for future marijuana themed entertainment. We want our characters to continue caring the torch of edgy adult subculture entertainment to the main stream public. We respect everyone in the industry for embarking in a business that has been deemed dangerous and evil in the name of politics and big business. We feel that our cartoon is the next best product in the cannabis and animation industry.</p>
<p>The third phase and motivation is where were at now. We want to bring our characters to full progression by bringing them to life in an animated cartoon series. We plan on using the popularity of the books as well as our new social media standing to bring this 20 yr project to your living room.</p>

</h3><p></p><p>We are Blind Mirth, St Andrews' oldest, best and only improv comedy 
group and we will be performing in the Edinburgh Fringe at SPACE on the Mile, Venue 39, 11-23th (not 17th) August 10:00-11.00pm!</p>
<p>We have performed in the Fringe for three years in a row, and were rated a five star show for the Fringe 2012 and 2013 (<a href=""http://www.broadwaybaby.com/listing.php?id=16783"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.broadwaybaby.com/listing.php?id=16783</a>, <a href=""http://edfringereview.com/r/UfF4jexMTfaXgD-7XDx6yg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://edfringereview.com/r/UfF4jexMTfaXgD-7XDx6yg</a> )
 and came within an inch of a sell-out show in 2013. It is very important to us 
that we can build upon last year's successes through building 
relationships with other improvisers, professional comedians and our 
audience outside of St Andrews. However, as we are all students, funding
 is difficult to come by and this is where you come in!</p>
<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need:</h3><p></p>Building off of our profits from last year, we only need to raise £500 to complete this venture. <br/>The money made
 from indiegogo will go primarily towards paying for venue fees (the most expensive element of the Fringe for an improv group) and publicity for the 
show (poster, flyers, press packs and stickers for you!).<p></p><p></p><h3></h3><h3>What you get in return</h3>
<p>It's your Mirth Day! As a group of creative-type people, we have a number of 
different goodies to give you on your Mirth Day (the day you donate!). All of the presents are detailed on the right. And, of course, no matter what present you choose, you will receive a Blind Mirth 2014 sticker sheet!<br/></p>
<p>All our items will be delivered by the end of the Fringe (if not 
earlier). If you do not receive them by the end of August, feel free to 
contact us at <a href=""mailto:blindmirth@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">blindmirth@gmail.com</a>. </p>
<h3>A little about the group</h3>
<p>Blind Mirth perform every week in St Andrews during term time 
entirely for free in the Barron Theatre, North Street, St Andrews. 
During our shows, we donate a large proportion of our time to various 
styles of long form comedy, improving that requires more stamina. At the Fringe, we drew inspiration from audience members' wallets 
and iPods to create longer scenes with more character development (we usually give the iPods and wallet back). The 
other part of the show is dedicated to short form improv games like 
those you may see on ""Whose Line"".</p>
We have performed with the likes of Craig Campbell, WitTank, The Scat
 Pack, the Noise Next Door and the Amateur Transplants, have worked with
 a lot of schools and societies in St Andrews through gigs and hosting 
jobs, and headlined Glasgow's Student Union Fresher's Week 2012. <br/><br/>If you are unable to donate, we would love to see you in Edinburgh at the show! We will be there from the 11-23th August (not 17th) in SPACE on the Mile, Venue 39 at 10:00pm! <br/>Or hit us

Il mio scopo primario sin dall'inizio è stato quello di fare fumetti nuovi e di promuovere i giovani artisti e quelli indie meno conosciuti grazie anche alla collaborazioni di professionisti noti e affermati. </p><p><b>Ed è quello che faccio tutt'ora.</b></p><p>Oggi sono qui a chiederVi di sostenere questa campagna di finanziamento per aiutare me e i miei compagni Passeggeri in vista della prossima Lucca Comics and Games 2015. Con i fondi raccolti grazie a questa speciale ""svendita"" estiva, finanzieremo l'affitto dello stand per la fiera e l'affitto del furgone con cui muoverci durante la manifestazione. Finalità pratiche per sostenerci in un ambiente dove la maggior parte dei lettori continua a seguire l'editoria mainstream e la distribuzione non aiuta i piccoli editori indie. A prezzi davvero scontatissimi potrete conoscere i nostri volumi d'esordio e alcune gemme ingiustamente poco conosciute. </p><p>Inoltre sono disponibili<b> tre succose novità</b>:</p><p>In prevendita <b><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/amazzoni.passengerpress"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Amazzoni</a></b>, il nuovo progetto collettivo sempre in formato pocket con una storia completa di oltre 250 pagine;</p><p><b><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Delicatessen/114249198663657"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Delicatessen</a></b>, la prima raccolta dei cinici disegni di Antonio Proietto con in regalo solo per le prime 100 copie la serie PINK delle Delicartoline;</p><p><b>L'albero della vita</b>, una serigrafia (27x38 cm su carta cotone 60% Fabriano Rosaspina Avorio) di <b><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Riccardo-Federici/162446040473281"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Riccardo Federici</a></b> in soli venti esemplari firmati e numerati a mano realizzata da quei matti di <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/perpetuaedizioni/timeline"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Perpetua</a>!</p><p>Per tutte queste ragioni la campagna è flessibile, perché veramente ogni singolo euro raccolto ci serve e verrà utilizzato e non sprecato.

</div></div>","La Passenger Press è nata nel 2007 con la sua prima pubblicazione The Passenger #0, un antologia di storie scritte da registi internazionali e disegnate da artisti italiani e stranieri, e da quell'anno è stata sempre presente con il suo stand alla fiera dei fumetti Lucca Comics and Games e per quattro anni anche alla fiera francese di Angouleme.Passenger Press non è una casa editrice tradizionale, ma piuttosto un collettivo multiculturale di artisti da tutto il mondo la cui finalità è promuovere il fumetto come media, stimolando la vostra curiosità al di fuori di tutto ciò che è mainstream.Personalmente il business non mi è mai interessato e tutto è sempre stato re-investito in nuove pubblicazioni. Il mio scopo primario sin dall'inizio è stato quello di fare fumetti nuovi e di promuovere i giovani artisti e quelli indie meno conosciuti grazie anche alla collaborazioni di professionisti noti e affermati. Ed è quello che faccio tutt'ora.Oggi sono qui a chiederVi di sostenere questa campagna di finanziamento per aiutare me e i miei compagni Passeggeri in vista della prossima Lucca Comics and Games 2015. Con i fondi raccolti grazie a questa speciale ""svendita"" estiva, finanzieremo l'affitto dello stand per la fiera e l'affitto del furgone con cui muoverci durante la manifestazione. Finalità pratiche per sostenerci in un ambiente dove la maggior parte dei lettori continua a seguire l'editoria mainstream e la distribuzione non aiuta i piccoli editori indie. A prezzi davvero scontatissimi potrete conoscere i nostri volumi d'esordio e alcune gemme ingiustamente poco conosciute. Inoltre sono disponibili tre succose novità:In prevendita Amazzoni, il nuovo progetto collettivo sempre in formato pocket con una storia completa di oltre 250 pagine;Delicatessen, la prima raccolta dei cinici disegni di Antonio Proietto con in regalo solo per le prime 100 copie la serie PINK delle Delicartoline;L'albero della vita, una serigrafia (27x38 cm su carta cotone 60% Fabriano Rosaspina Avorio) di Riccardo Federici in soli venti esemplari firmati e numerati a mano realizzata da quei matti di Perpetua!Per tutte queste ragioni la campagna è flessibile, perché veramente ogni singolo euro raccolto ci serve e verrà utilizzato e non sprecato. Aiutateci sostenendoci anche tramite la diffusione di questa campagna. Vi aspettiamo per un saluto e quattro chiacchiere al nostro stand, vi aspettiamo a braccia aperte a Lucca Comics and Games 2015.Seguiteci sulle nostre pagine Facebook!!!NOVITA' Passenger Press 2015.

Per cosa serviranno i fondi raccolti?
Come detto in precedenza, tutti i soldi raccolti ci saranno davvero utili. Per questo, dato che abbiamo ancora copie disponibili delle passate pubblicazioni, abbiamo scelto una raccolta flessibile. Una sorta di FUORI TUTTO non solo per liberare il magazzino per far posto ai nuovi libri, ma anche per lavorare al meglio e con più fondi.

Nel caso riuscissimo a raggiungere il nostro target di 2200 euro ecco come saranno impiegati i soldi, tolta la parte di tasse e le spese di spedizione che sono in media per l'Italia 4 euro di raccomandata in piego di libri inclusi nei perk:

1400 euro per lo stand 
e il restante per aiutarci a pagare l'affitto del furgone

E se dovessimo superare la soglia prefissata, gli ulteriori soldi raccolti serviranno a finanziare i nuovi progetti. Se mai dovesse capitare Vi aggiorneremo, nel massimo della trasparenza.

The Journey
Hey there! 
My name is Raquel Simoso, also known as Skailla. I’m a comic artist from Brazil who’s always been passionate about telling stories and drawing animals. 
Over 10 years ago I came up with two characters, a wolf and a fox, who despite their opposite nature, formed a strong bond of friendship and love. They are Dikon and Amy. 

Over the years, they have been featured in a few projects, such as the animatic, Blue Blood, available on my YouTube channel. 
After over 5 months of work, this adventure came to life in the form of our newest book: Beyond the Woods, a story told entirely through color and expression in 100 fully illustrated pages.




After the amazing success of the Up and Ahead campaign (a big thank you to everyone who supported it!) our next step is our first hard covered book!

<p><strong>Help launch Dr Phantom and his brilliant work across the world</strong></p>
<p>Hi, my name is Steve Skinner, a Leeds based writer, all round creative chap who needs your help. I've spent ten years developing the material for Almost Everything Explained, which I am told is a hilarious and highly original book. It is the Nearly Complete Guide to the Universe, where the totally fictitious but brilliant scientist - Dr Phantom - explains:</p>
<p>Life on earth, great civilisations, mad scientists,</p>
<p>How the world started and what to do when it ends</p>
<p>How traffic wardens evolved from dinosaurs and where to go on holiday in the Bronze Age</p>
<p>With funding I will be able to print a hard copy of Almost Everything Explained and finally realise my dream of my first illustrated book of self published fiction. To do this I have already invested in a website, branding, social media and created the art work for the 104 page full colour book, using a professional designer, but now need help to get the off set litho rolling!</p>
<p>To print 1000 copies, I need exactly £5994 and need to raise this by mid September 2013. For only £50 you'll receive a printed copy of the publication, personally signed by the brilliant Hungarian, world famous and slightly eccentric Dr Phantom...if you're in a generous mood, a donation of £200 or over will give you an exclusive signed, high quality framed copy of an original full colour illustration from the book. However, a third option is you can receive the epub version of the book in return for donating £20. The gifts will be sent out after the book production in early October. If I don't hit our target, all monies raised will be used purely to print the book.</p>
<p>I am a successful trainer, writer and musician, with many years of experience of delivering on projects like this nature; I am a former arts administrator and professional song writer, now also band leader for a world music band called Fusion...</p>
<p>OK enough about me, but if you need to know more about Dr Phantom, please watch the video or get in touch.</p>
<p>Your contribution could help to introduce Dr Phantom to the world as one of the greatest thinkers of the 21st century! Please don't forget to share this campaign with all your friends, family, neighbours, camping buddies, car mechanics, funeral directors etc.</p>
<p>So thanks for reading all this and I hope to hear from you.</p>

<h3>Hello</h3>
<p>My name is Josh Bauman and I'm an American cartoonist based in Berlin. For the past two years I've been drawing <a href=""http://www.caffeinatedtoothpaste.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title=""Caffeinated Toothpaste"">Caffeinated Toothpaste</a>, my daily diary comic. Drawing a daily comic began as an exercise to improve my storytelling, writing, and art, though most of all, it was a way for me to do more of what I love most, which is making comics! After a few months and lots of great encouragement I decided to share the strips as a web comic. </p>
<p><img align=""right"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://caffeinatedtoothpaste.com/files/campaign/inking.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>What began as an exercise started becoming more exciting for me. With each milestone I reached with the diary comic the more I wanted to keep on working on it. As months went by I found myself looking more and more forward to the part of the day I spent drawing a strip. After one year I self-published the first compilation of my diary strips.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Having just reached the 700-strip mark I have no plans of slowing down. I am, however, preparing my second compilation of diary strips. Unlike my first book, which was produced using print-on-demand publication, this second volume will be offset printed in vibrant full color. It's not just the color that's the different in this volume. Caffeinated Toothpaste: Volume 2 will be printed with far superior materials. Best of all, I'm working with a local printer and graphic designer! My personal goal for this project is to create the best looking book possible. </p>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>Using print-on-demand for my first book allowed me to order a small quantity of books at a given time. However, for high quality offset printing the entire order must be produced at once. Unfortunately offset printing requires a great deal of technical preparation. The initial setup for the print run makes up a majority of the expense whereas the actual cost of the printing materials is rather low, which makes it financially necessary to order a single larger shipment of books. </p>

<p><strong>THE INHERITORS comic book</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong><strong>This world is like nothing you've ever seen!  This is the world of ENTOMO, </strong>where giant insects roam, strange vegetation is abundant and all sorts of Entomoid kingdoms vie for supremacy.</p>
<p>In this backdrop a young <strong>PRINCE ZEN</strong> is involved in a forbidden love affair with a Bugari maid, <strong>LADY FAYAWA</strong>Y, and must escape the kingdom of <strong>STRATA</strong>, the only home he's ever known, and struggle to survive together in the savage lands beyond.</p>

<p><strong>WHO AM I AND WHAT AM I DOING HERE?</strong></p>
<p>I'm <strong>ANTHONY WAYNE PETTUS</strong>, the author and illustrator of this comic book project and I started <strong>IMPETTUS ENTERTAINMENT</strong> to create utter madness? What? -- NO! To bring a new look to the field of comics.  I wanted to use my background as a writer and director (of most notably the movie MINDBENDERS) to bring a cinematic sweep and look along with interesting and dynamic characters that you can care about. I want to make each book an event just like when you're anticipating a great movie that you can't wait to see just as I felt when I was a kid (or adult for that matter, I'm still a big kid). That's why I created <strong>THE INHERITORS</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>WHAT YOU CAN DO?</strong></p>
<p>You've got it easy! Just enjoy my video and sample pages from my book and decide you'd like to see this book made.  A $5 contribution will get you your own copy of the first issue of <strong>THE INHERITORS</strong> as well as cover the delivery cost.</p>
<p>For those who can pay a little more we have <strong>HIGHER REWARD TIERS</strong> specially for <strong>INDIEGOGO</strong> pledges that will give you <strong>GREAT</strong> souvenir<strong> PAGES</strong> OF <strong>ART</strong> signed by me of different exciting characters that are in or will be in the book. Hey, who knows? it may have historic significance one day!  I still kick myself for once having the first SPIDER-MAN and FANTASTIC FOUR and other iconic comic books when I was a kid. I still don't know what happened to those books.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT DO I NEED YOUR MONEY FOR?</strong></p>
<p>To pay for coloring this bad boy and to pay for publishing of course.  People good at what they do have to get paid.  That's the real world.  You'll see in my video the difference between seeing my book in color and seeing it in black and white.  In the bright colorful world in which my characters inhabit, it would be cheating you to show it any other way than the way it should be shown in all its glory.</p>
<p><strong>HOW DO YOU KNOW I'LL DELIVER?</strong></p>
<p>The only person that wants you to get a copy of my book more than you is <strong>ME</strong>!  If you aren't happy, I'm not happy.  The reason for doing all this is for you to see this great book when it's ready and continue seeing my work in the future. Let's make <strong>THE INHERITORS</strong> happen. </p>
<p>You can contact me a variety of ways through Facebook, Twitter, <strong>IMPETTUS.COM</strong> (my website), or at a comic con or through my friends.  I value your patronage and will answer your messages personally.  If I screw up and forget to answer just send a reminder -- I'll get back to you if I'm not in the hospital or something (perish the thought).  We really need your help here.

<h3>Feminist as What?!</h3>
<p><br/><strong><i>Feminist AF is the work of Pia Alize and Malathi Jogi, originally published online as ""Custom Cuts"". It's a 32pg comic exploration of feminism today, and why it's important for our feminism to be international +  intersectional. </i></strong></p>

<h3>
<br/>Why comics?</h3>
<p>Well, that's what we do. They're fast, fun and easy to read. Over the past few years, Ad Astra Comix (that's us!) has published eight comics projects dealing with different social justice themes. Feminist AF is our next project, and we're excited to bring a simple and affordable comic about feminism to the public at large! <br/><br/>...That's where you come in! We're a small publisher and we rely on  pre-order campaigns to finance our print runs. By supporting this crowdfunder, you'll be helping us print hundreds --hopefully thousands of copies. We want to see this accessable and affordable feminist comic  find its way into classrooms, cafes and bookstores across the continent.  In this way, you'll be helping carry on the conversation about what it means to be feminist.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540524976/gijw8czcxjjj33gffw9n.jpg"" src=""""/><br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Helping us get there</h3>
<p>Like we said, <strong>We need your help!</strong> Publishing comics is a resource-intensive project, and lots of unpaid hours go into making each of our books happen - from promotional work to layouts, to our shipping parties. Reaching our goal all helps us breath a little easier as we make these projects happen! </p>
<p><br/><strong>Here's what you can do:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Order yourself a copy of the comic (or two. Yea, maybe two).</li>
<li>Do you think your feminist pals would be into this project? Let them know about it!</li>
<li>While you're at it, share this like you would a viral news story about Trump saying something appalling. (If we could get a share for every 100 Trump-horrorshares, we'd be fully funded by the time you finished reading this!)<br/> </li>

<br/>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>All publishing projects have their risks and challenges - usually, by the time a comic is going to print, the biggest risks and challenges have been settled! Feminist AF is such a project: the comics are finished and the book is ready to go to print.<br/><br/>Our goal is always: run a campaign in the black. Books printed by larger publishers can reach deep into their pockets and run book production at a loss until the title is able to be sold in the store. We don't have that kind of luxury; instead, we use a more democratic model (crowdfunding!) to get the job done. ...Hey, thanks to you, that is!  <br/><br/>In order to print this comic and make sure our creators get their copies sent / royalties paid, we want to reach our goal of $3,500. The only risk we face is not making this goal (which is unlikely given the range of our previous crowdfunders).  But if we do not, we will simply lower the print-run and take a small profit loss on the sales of the book moving forward. The short answer to the question of this risk is: we've gone to print with every project we've ever run.</p>

</div></div>","Feminist as What?!
Feminist AF is the work of Pia Alize and Malathi Jogi, originally published online as ""Custom Cuts"". It's a 32pg comic exploration of feminism today, and why it's important for our feminism to be international +  intersectional. 


Why comics?
Well, that's what we do. They're fast, fun and easy to read. Over the past few years, Ad Astra Comix (that's us!) has published eight comics projects dealing with different social justice themes. Feminist AF is our next project, and we're excited to bring a simple and affordable comic about feminism to the public at large! ...That's where you come in! We're a small publisher and we rely on  pre-order campaigns to finance our print runs. By supporting this crowdfunder, you'll be helping us print hundreds --hopefully thousands of copies. We want to see this accessable and affordable feminist comic  find its way into classrooms, cafes and bookstores across the continent.  In this way, you'll be helping carry on the conversation about what it means to be feminist.
 

Helping us get there
Like we said, We need your help! Publishing comics is a resource-intensive project, and lots of unpaid hours go into making each of our books happen - from promotional work to layouts, to our shipping parties. Reaching our goal all helps us breath a little easier as we make these projects happen! 
Here's what you can do:

Order yourself a copy of the comic (or two. Yea, maybe two).
Do you think your feminist pals would be into this project? Let them know about it!
While you're at it, share this like you would a viral news story about Trump saying something appalling. (If we could get a share for every 100 Trump-horrorshares, we'd be fully funded by the time you finished reading this!)
