<p>My name is <strong>Jason Sani </strong>and I am the author of <strong>Making Healthy Taste Good</strong>. My life is all about delicious food, I've been studying nutrition for more than 12 years and I want to share my methods with you in an organized and easy to follow format. </p>
<p>My experience and knowledge comes from working with clients for the last 10 years. This includes overcoming challenges such as picky eaters, eating on the go, fat-loss, menu design, and food prep. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What makes Making Healthy Taste Good unique?</h3>
<p>Do-ability factor! At the end of the day, a recipe needs to be easy to follow, so I've made sure that everything is simple.This book is an adventure guide with descriptive pictures of recipes that you will actually put together with tools that you actually have. These recipes have been tested and approved by kids and big kids just like yourself. You'll find methods such as using tea to cook with, how you can use a tasty waffle or ice cream to deliver the nutrients that <strong>your body is hungry for. </strong></p>

<p>This is my purpose. I can confidently say that this is the most important project that I have ever worked on. I have poured more than 1,000 hours directly into the writing, testing, and design of this book. Making food taste good is simple, making food that nourishes something that you crave can be challenging at first, explaining it in a way that strips down intimidation has been quite the journey. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>All of the heavy-lifting is completed; I have compiled all of my favorite recipes that are just waiting to see the inside of your kitchen.  I've decided to go the route of self-publishing and printing a color book full of descriptive pictures is not cheap.

I am a therapist and an educator. I want to increase awareness about what we can do about stress in Managua, Nicaragua. Nicaragua is one of the poorest countries in the hemisphere. People suffer from poverty, physical and emotional violence, gender inequality and lack of affection and quality time in the family. This results in high stress, anxiety, and physical problems. I want to do all I can and add to the growing network of healers and teachers working on this important social issue.""</p><p><strong>What is this about?

I choose this program because of it's skilful, respectful and dynamic understanding of the brain-body connection. I am asking for your help to send me to the training (including room and board) and provide materials for courses and marketing(books, art materials and on-line professional support).

I am a therapist and an educator. I want to increase awareness about what we can do about stress in Managua, Nicaragua. Nicaragua is one of the poorest countries in the hemisphere. People suffer from poverty, physical and emotional violence, gender inequality and lack of affection and quality time in the family. This results in high stress, anxiety, and physical problems. I want to do all I can and add to the growing network of healers and teachers working on this important social issue.""What is this about? Why do I need money?My business in the healing arts is growing. People are looking to understand stress and overcome anxiety more effectively. Power Brain Education is an integral health program that blends a variety of healing arts techniques with the latest in neuroscience research. I choose this program because of it's skilful, respectful and dynamic understanding of the brain-body connection. I am asking for your help to send me to the training (including room and board) and provide materials for courses and marketing(books, art materials and on-line professional support). Your help will serve as the basis for growing my business as a healer and educator.Who do I reach out to?Five years ago, I moved to Managua to work and teach. Since 2012 I have brought both healing and yoga to students, teachers, parents, and professional adults - people were in need of a better quality of life. I have seen people's lives transformed. Primarily I work with caregivers and people with the majority of responsibility for their organizations and who feel burnout and in need for more spaces of self care. I also work with children and their teachers to introduce movement and mindfulness into the regular school program. Students find more  joy, clarity, focus, inner peace and self-awareness through this experience.For 4 years I worked in Casa Alianza, a residency center for at-risk teenagers. We used power brain methods for over 300 youths in weekly classes. We emphasized yoga-like movements and mindfulness techniques, art and storytelling. At the beginning of the classes teens often arrived angry, frustrated and distracted; within 20-30 minutes, the environment always transformed into one of calmness and focus. People also reported heightened self-confidence and a positive outlook. On average 70% of students in each class could change their mood, and 30% of students who had left Casa Alianza later expressed that they still use the exercises to relieve stressNext stepsNow I have the chance to reach out to teachers and professionals and train them in the practice and benefits of Power Brain education. I have a strong basis as an active yoga instructor and educator in my community. So far, my current level of training can only take me so far with what I can teach. Time to expand my scope and build on what I already know and what I can already do. Through this training, I can offer Power Brain Education to Nicaragua. I need your help for the training. Power Brain Education uses well-structured classes and on-going training; engaging physical, emotional and cognitive exercises to promote better self-esteem; enhance creativity; improve health and help any practitioner improve their mental focus and concentration. The philosophy holds the body/brain connection as a central value to it's education model.While in the US mindfulness and wellness practices are being assimilated with enthusiasm, they are just up-and-coming in Nicaragua.  People are interested and want to try new techniques.Expenses are high and money is tight in Nicaragua. It will take money, sponsorship and time before teachers, parents and schools are ready to devote funds to alternative education.I want to champion this important work and I need your help.When you donate your dollars, I will donate my hours!In exchange for your generous donations towards my training, I will reach out to a variety of well-known and beloved institutions to offer free healing packages to the people in desperate need but cannot pay for individual healing sessions, yoga classes or exposure to the benefits of Power Brain Education. I will reach out to groups like:CDCA & Nueva Vida Clinic: http://jhc-cdca.org/ CEPS: https://www.facebook.com/Centro-de-Estudios-y-P... CANTERA: http://cscantera.blogspot.com/ & CANTERA - Centro de Comunicación y Educación Popular...and if you know of a group, institution or individual/family that really needs support and you think this might help please consider sponsoring them.Healing packages are listed as PERKS in this campaign, Please claim the perk when you donate.

<p><i>From the beginning, I wanted to make sure that I could produce a high quality product using USA-sourced raw materials as well as labor, so everything from the glass to the paper is  from the USA.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>OUR STORY</strong></p>
<p>As a daughter who watched her mother pass away from dementia-related illness and a daughter-in-law currently helping care for a mother-in-law with Alzheimer's, I receive tremendous joy witnessing others connect in a meaningful way with loved ones who have great difficulty remembering special times of their lives. Several years ago, I decided to use the experience I had gained working in the flavors and fragrances industry for over 20 years to create a smell-based memory care product for reminiscence therapy.  The sense of smell is kept deep inside the most ancient part of the brain and research has confirmed that smells can trigger memories far more vivid and further back in time than even images and music.  </p>
<p>My motto, ""Reaching To Memories Through The Sense Of Smell,"" led me to form a start-up company called The Scent Guru Group LLC and design and trademark a product called the<strong> Essential Awakenings Smell and Memory Kit</strong>.  The prototype (very similar to what is now the finished product) consisted of carefully-developed samples of six everyday, ordinary smells (such as jasmine, chocolate and freshly-cut grass) selected to help connect the aging with memories from everyday life. The smells are meant to be administered by adults who want to engage in a ""guessing"" game with their elderly parents, friends, or patients.  Clue cards and smelling strips are included with the kit to help guide caregivers in the administration of the smells.  The smells are not ""perfumes"" and are not meant to be worn, but are safe when coming in contact with the skin.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498091865/wjjybyqdpxued7xkyzxn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>With the prototype in hand, I volunteered my time conducting more than 25 ""smelling sessions""  with a total of over 200 participants at six senior care facilities in Connecticut, New York, Arkansas, and Tennessee. Those included Atria of Stamford, CT, River House Adult Day Center in Cos Cob, CT, The Greens of Greenwich in Greenwich, CT, The Hebrew Home of the Aging in Riverdale, NY, Culpepper Place in Springdale, AR and Carriage House of Memphis, TN.  </p>
<p>Almost immediately I saw what a powerful impact my kits had on reminiscence and communication. During one smelling session, for example,  some of the residents at a nursing home unexpectedly started conversing with each other, sharing memories of receiving and experiencing the joys of chocolate, while others started discussing how they loved lilacs and had a lilac bush in their gardens.</p>
<p>I am proud to say that the prototype of The Essential Awakenings Smell and Memory Kit earned a product endorsement from Ottavio Arancio M.D., Ph.D., Columbia University Medical Center which is featured on the packaging of the final product.  And Essential Awakenings just this month was announced as the first-place winner in Connecticut of the Small Business Administration's InnovateHER 2017: Innovating For Women Business Challenge. Now onto the national competition, the results of which will be announced later this year.</p>
<p>With the Premier Edition of Essential Awakenings now ready to ship, we are reaching out to raise $50,000 in funds to manufacture the Second Edition of Essential Awakenings Smell and Memory Kit, which will include six other distinct smells, and a third, ""Complete Edition"" which will feature 15 smells.</p>
<p>Our mission is to improve quality of life for aging seniors by providing high-quality, smell-based products that elicit cherished memories and help individuals to engage in pleasant conversation with their caregivers.  We hope you will join us in our journey.</p>

<p><i>""Essential Awakenings with Ruth is a fun and important experience for residents at any facility. The scents that Ruth creates elicit memories for our residents, and inspires socialization through conversation about what scents appeal to which people. A favorite memory from one of our first Essential Awakenings groups was when one resident kept commenting with each new scent, ""It's opening up my nostrils!"" This resident was smiling the entire group, and simply enjoyed celebrating a sense of empowerment through stimulating their sense of smell. With age, our sense of smell dwindles. Therefore, having a group with the goal of awakening such an identifying aspect of each person, is key to a well-rounded program. I am honored to incorporate Essential Awakenings into our programming; it adds so much to the sensory experience we hope to offer those in their last stage of life""</i><strong>. - Beth Liebowitz, Program Director, The Greens, Greenwich, CT</strong></p>

<h3>Forest Therapy </h3>
<p>For many of you, the terms “Forest Therapy” and “Shinrin-yoku” may be unfamiliar. Not to worry! The practice is relatively new to Western culture, and is only just now beginning to gain momentum as more and more people are feeling called to return to nature, and thus seek meaningful ways in which to do so. This campaign will support me in starting up my business as a certified Forest Therapy Guide so as to offer Forest Therapy services within the Okanagan region of Western Canada, as a means for people to mindfully return to nature. </p>

<li>Boosts immune system function</li>
<li>Reduces stress</li>
<li>Reduces anxiety</li>
<li>Relieves symptoms of depression</li>
<li>Lowers blood pressure</li>
<li>Improves concentration</li>
<li>Lowers blood sugar</li>

<p><strong>In a nutshell, what is Forest Therapy/Shinrin-yoku?</strong></p>
<p>Shinrin-yoku is a Japanese term that translates to “forest bathing”, or “taking in the forest atmosphere”. It was developed in Japan during the 1980s and has become a cornerstone of preventive health care and healing in Japanese medicine. The idea is simple: if a person simply visits a natural area and walks in a relaxed way there are calming, rejuvenating and restorative benefits to be achieved. </p>
<p>The Association of Nature and Forest Therapy writes:</p>
<p><i>""Forest bathing seems to significantly mitigate the root cause of a multitude of ailments: Excess stress can play a role in headaches, high blood pressure, heart problems, diabetes, skin conditions, asthma, and arthritis, among many other ailments. </i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>“What is a Certified Forest Therapy Guide, and why do I need one?”</strong></p>
<p>In much the same way a yoga instructor guides you through linking breath and movement to achieve a mindful connection between body and spirit, a Forest Therapy Guide guides you through the opening of all your senses to bring you into a deeper connection with the earth.</p>
<p>﻿​The Association of Nature and Forest Therapy writes, <i>“A Forest Therapy Guide facilitates safe, gentle walks, providing instructions—referred to as “invitations”—for sensory opening activities along the way. On Forest Therapy walks, people have a wide range of experiences, some of which they feel are significant, even profound. Guides are trained in the skills and perspectives needed to be supportive witnesses of these experiences…By slowing people down and facilitating sensory experiencing, guides open the doorways through which the forest can accomplish its healing work.”</i> - (<a href=""http://www.natureandforesttherapy.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.natureandforesttherapy.org</a>)</p>
<p>With a guide present to remind people of how to linger, simply be where they are, and open to the subtle sensations around them, wonder and awe are given an opportunity to reappear within their hearts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why am I passionate about nature and bringing Forest Therapy to the public professionally?</strong></p>
<p>Because I love being human, and I love the forest! I full-heartedly adore experiencing nature as intimately and wildly as possibly through my senses, and I want to share that ridiculous, unbound joy with as many people as I’m able to.  I firmly believe that we are alive to live, that our capacity for emotion, sensation, and expression is as breathtaking as the earth that supports us through all our trials and explorations as a species. A number of scientific studies have also been done to confirm that there are many ways in which the forest supports our health and well-being on a physical as well as emotional and mental level. These studies may be referenced in the resources section below.</p>
<p>Please think for a moment…when did you last visit a forest, take off your shoes, and wrap your arms around a tree? How often do you sprawl in a river, or hang upside down from a tree branch until all your laughter falls out of your belly? And have you ever walked out of the forest feeling more stressed and uptight than when you walked in?</p>

<p>A large part of my inspiration for bringing Forest Therapy to the public stems from my own journey through a health crisis, and how the forest supported my healing.</p>
<p>When I was fourteen, I was struck with chronic migraine headaches. I was in agony every day for four years, despite being tested, scanned, examined, and put on countless drugs (which only made me sicker). I finally made a breakthrough when I started taking myself out into the forest, barefooted, and wandering where I willed, exploring nature and truly experiencing my senses for the first time. I climbed trees and sat in them for hours; I played in rivers and gave myself dirt baths. I willed my headaches away, and with daily contact with the forest, a shift into a holistic lifestyle, and avoidance of harsh fluorescent lighting, they dissipated.</p>
<p>Over the years, my connection with nature deepened until I was spending more time around trees than people. I could no longer think of anything besides the forest when engaged in other affairs, and I could not bear to be gone from it longer than a few days at a time. I felt myself become frazzled and unfocused, ungrounded and scattered when too much time passed without contact with the trees. I hadn't realized up until that point how enormously the forest was impacting me and by body, and how sensitive I was becoming to the harshness of the city world.</p>
<p>I have learned the most fundamental of life’s lessons through my playful connection with nature, and through my experiences have realize that the source of all healing stems from here.</p>

<p>Every Forest Therapy walk is a unique experience, as you open your senses and relax into your environment in new ways each time - tuning in to elements that had previously been beyond your reach.

<p><strong>The purpose of this campaign:</strong></p>
<p>To raise the funds required to start up The Infinity Experience as a business (which includes certification as a Forest Therapy Guide) within the Okanagan valley, and to ultimately establish Forest Therapy as a recognized and valued therapy in Western Canada;</p>
<p>To bring awareness to the rising need for a reconnection with nature on personal, societal, and global scales for the survival and wellbeing of the human race, and for the wellbeing of the earth as a sensitive, interconnected, and sentient system;</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>The Infinity Experience Mission Statement</strong></p>
<p><i>The Infinity Experience exists to provide Western Canada with the industry of guided Forest Therapy Walks, to reconnect individuals with nature and their senses through the practice of Shinrin-yoku, which translates to ""Forest Bathing"" or ""taking in the forest atmosphere"". </i></p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Western society as a whole is suffering from NDD: Nature-Deficit-Disorder. Technology is advancing at increasingly faster rates; people are engaging with an artificially constructed world on an hourly basis, and any leftover energy goes into maintaining the stresses of their demanding lives. On average, children now spend less time outside each day than prison inmates, who are guaranteed two hours of outdoor time every day. </p>
<p>The connection our species once had with the natural world is disappearing rapidly, and this spells disaster for our future. A balance between technology and natural human sensation must be found so that we can cultivate a greater awareness of ourselves and our planet's need for our stewardship. We appreciate what we love, and for us to love the forests, we must spend time getting to know them, opening ourselves to the wonder and healing gifts they offer.</p>
<p>Forest Therapy seeks to slow humanity down, awaken the senses, and facilitate a re-connection with nature. </p>
</div><div>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<p>The main challenges I am facing as I begin down this path are my inexperience in business and management, and a lack of start-up funding.</p>
<p>To overcome this I am providing myself with an internationally recognized certification training to fulfill my role as a Forest Therapy Guide, sourcing out adequate funding, and setting up a management support team.</p>
<p>Thanks to the support of my dearest friends and my own love for the forest, I have absolute confidence in my ability to bring together all the elements necessary to create this business and provide an extraordinary service as a Forest Therapy Guide. For all the wonderful experiences I have felt called to embrace over the years, I have never felt so passionate about any of them as I feel about my desire to help others connect with the beauty, wonder, and healing embrace of nature. </p>
<p>Most of all, I have confidence in all of you who are tuning in to me and my goals! As passionate and emotional human beings, we have a fundamental desire in this life to share in each other’s happiness and success: it benefits the whole community when we can support each other.</p>

</div></div>","Forest Therapy 
For many of you, the terms “Forest Therapy” and “Shinrin-yoku” may be unfamiliar. Not to worry! The practice is relatively new to Western culture, and is only just now beginning to gain momentum as more and more people are feeling called to return to nature, and thus seek meaningful ways in which to do so. This campaign will support me in starting up my business as a certified Forest Therapy Guide so as to offer Forest Therapy services within the Okanagan region of Western Canada, as a means for people to mindfully return to nature. 
 
Benefits of Forest Therapy:

Boosts immune system function
Reduces stress
Reduces anxiety
Relieves symptoms of depression
Lowers blood pressure
Improves concentration
Lowers blood sugar
Accelerates recovery from surgery or illness
Detoxifies the body of digital over-stimulation
Increases ability to focus
Improves mood
Increases energy levels
Improves self-awareness
Deepens connection to senses
Greater connection to nature
Clears mind and heightens intuition


In a nutshell, what is Forest Therapy/Shinrin-yoku?
Shinrin-yoku is a Japanese term that translates to “forest bathing”, or “taking in the forest atmosphere”. It was developed in Japan during the 1980s and has become a cornerstone of preventive health care and healing in Japanese medicine. The idea is simple: if a person simply visits a natural area and walks in a relaxed way there are calming, rejuvenating and restorative benefits to be achieved. 
The Association of Nature and Forest Therapy writes:
""Forest bathing seems to significantly mitigate the root cause of a multitude of ailments: Excess stress can play a role in headaches, high blood pressure, heart problems, diabetes, skin conditions, asthma, and arthritis, among many other ailments. 
 
“What is a Certified Forest Therapy Guide, and why do I need one?”
In much the same way a yoga instructor guides you through linking breath and movement to achieve a mindful connection between body and spirit, a Forest Therapy Guide guides you through the opening of all your senses to bring you into a deeper connection with the earth.
﻿​The Association of Nature and Forest Therapy writes, “A Forest Therapy Guide facilitates safe, gentle walks, providing instructions—referred to as “invitations”—for sensory opening activities along the way. On Forest Therapy walks, people have a wide range of experiences, some of which they feel are significant, even profound. Guides are trained in the skills and perspectives needed to be supportive witnesses of these experiences…By slowing people down and facilitating sensory experiencing, guides open the doorways through which the forest can accomplish its healing work.” - (http://www.natureandforesttherapy.org)
With a guide present to remind people of how to linger, simply be where they are, and open to the subtle sensations around them, wonder and awe are given an opportunity to reappear within their hearts.
 
Why am I passionate about nature and bringing Forest Therapy to the public professionally?
Because I love being human, and I love the forest! I full-heartedly adore experiencing nature as intimately and wildly as possibly through my senses, and I want to share that ridiculous, unbound joy with as many people as I’m able to.  I firmly believe that we are alive to live, that our capacity for emotion, sensation, and expression is as breathtaking as the earth that supports us through all our trials and explorations as a species. A number of scientific studies have also been done to confirm that there are many ways in which the forest supports our health and well-being on a physical as well as emotional and mental level. These studies may be referenced in the resources section below.
Please think for a moment…when did you last visit a forest, take off your shoes, and wrap your arms around a tree? How often do you sprawl in a river, or hang upside down from a tree branch until all your laughter falls out of your belly? And have you ever walked out of the forest feeling more stressed and uptight than when you walked in?

A large part of my inspiration for bringing Forest Therapy to the public stems from my own journey through a health crisis, and how the forest supported my healing.
When I was fourteen, I was struck with chronic migraine headaches. I was in agony every day for four years, despite being tested, scanned, examined, and put on countless drugs (which only made me sicker). I finally made a breakthrough when I started taking myself out into the forest, barefooted, and wandering where I willed, exploring nature and truly experiencing my senses for the first time. I climbed trees and sat in them for hours; I played in rivers and gave myself dirt baths. I willed my headaches away, and with daily contact with the forest, a shift into a holistic lifestyle, and avoidance of harsh fluorescent lighting, they dissipated.
Over the years, my connection with nature deepened until I was spending more time around trees than people. I could no longer think of anything besides the forest when engaged in other affairs, and I could not bear to be gone from it longer than a few days at a time. I felt myself become frazzled and unfocused, ungrounded and scattered when too much time passed without contact with the trees. I hadn't realized up until that point how enormously the forest was impacting me and by body, and how sensitive I was becoming to the harshness of the city world.
I have learned the most fundamental of life’s lessons through my playful connection with nature, and through my experiences have realize that the source of all healing stems from here.

Every Forest Therapy walk is a unique experience, as you open your senses and relax into your environment in new ways each time - tuning in to elements that had previously been beyond your reach. The further you sink into this practice, the greater the rewards for your health...and the more alive you feel!

 
The purpose of this campaign:
To raise the funds required to start up The Infinity Experience as a business (which includes certification as a Forest Therapy Guide) within the Okanagan valley, and to ultimately establish Forest Therapy as a recognized and valued therapy in Western Canada;
To bring awareness to the rising need for a reconnection with nature on personal, societal, and global scales for the survival and wellbeing of the human race, and for the wellbeing of the earth as a sensitive, interconnected, and sentient system;
And to offer everyone who resonates with my dream the opportunity to be involved with the introduction of a healing practice that offers balance, and a greater sense of connection with the wonder and beauty of the natural world!
 

What We Need & What You Get
$50,000 is needed to fuel the start-up of this business. If I do not reach my goal, the funds will still be going towards all the business start-up expenses, where they are needed most urgently:

Certification training
Business insurance
Business licence  
Business vehicle
Business phone
Website production
Marketing
Publication of book on connecting with nature

While I feel that all of you who are supporting me are total superstars and any contribution is enormously welcomed and appreciated, I am offering some special perks for those who want to make larger contributions and be directly involved in receiving the benefits of this Forest Therapy practice!
If you live out of area and are not certain that you yourself may have the ability to use these Forest Therapy walk punch cards, consider those in your life who could benefit from these walks as a gift: friends or family who may either reside in the Okanagan region or who will be visiting sometime in the future.

</ul></div>","Our story Heart & Hands Health Collective is a grassroots, locally-owned Community Acupuncture & Holistic Health clinic. Our focus is providing compassionate and accessible services to our community. Our mission is to transform community health into community wealth.The acupuncture team at Heart & Hands provides an average of 750-900 sessions monthly all at $20-50 sliding scale rates, open to everyone in our community.We are also home to high quality, inclusive services including Naturopathic Medicine, Herbal Medicine and Craniosacral Therapy. We are a bustling community hub where people from all walks of life come together to rest, recover and heal. We aim to shift and support attitudes around preventative care. We have always put our focus on providing accessible services for the public good over profits. We are committed to serving the Victoria community, proudly make our home in the working class North Park neighbourhood and filling in the gaps of our healthcare system.As a tiny, values-based establishment in Downtown Victoria, it is no longer sustainable for us to remain a business due to the rapidly rising operating costs.It is time to change the playing field.  Next stepsWe plan to transition into a non-profit, so we can maintain our two core principles:
Maintain affordability for our client base
Pay our practitioners a living wage
Cost of living continues to rise, yet wages do not.Many in our community lack health benefits or their coverage is extremely limited. Minimum wage in Victoria is $13.85, income assistance provides $710/month and monthly disability assistance is $1133. Somehow, those with limited means need to cover basic expenses (ie. rent, food, transportation, etc.) in a city with an ever-rising cost of living. Our flexible rates make it more sustainable for a larger segment of our community to maintain a regular course of treatment. We want to make it possible to get well AND stay well.  The crux of the issue - Property taxesProperty values downtown YYJ continue to rise, making it increasingly difficult to cover our expenses. We strongly feel that raising our rates or cutting wages are not viable solutions, which go against our mission and values.In 2019, $10 850 in property taxes were paid to the City of Victoria. Based on the current rise in property value, our projected 2020 property tax will be approximately $12 000.2019 was also an unexpected and uncertain year of decreased capacity and financial deficit due to Owner/Operator, Christina Chan's health crisis and continued recovery from major surgery. Becoming a non-profit has been on the back burner for quite some time. The circumstances of the past year has been that extra push to make this necessary transition. We need to raise a total of $15 000 =$12 000 for 2020 property tax + $3000 for the administrative transition to non-profitBecoming a non-profit will provide the opportunity to apply for property tax exemption with the City of Victoria in 2021. We are racing to meet the May 31, 2020 deadline. If our application for exemption is approved by city council, we may be granted a complete or partial exemption from property taxes for 3 years! This will alleviate a portion of our tax burdens and allow us to reinvest it back into our community! Why go non-profit?Since opening our doors in 2010, despite being a business, we have always operated with a people before profits approach. We exist as a vital service to the community, affordably supporting our community’s health and well-being at sliding scale rates. In a way, we have unofficially functioned as a non-profit for almost 10 years. And now this is our opportunity to make it official!Becoming a non-profit:
Is a long term investment in our core principles
Maintains our ability to provide affordable sliding scale rates for community acupuncture
Continues to support our mission of providing accessible and inclusive holistic health services for the community
Alleviates a portion of our taxes so revenues can be reinvested into our organization
Supports a living wage, professional development and healthcare benefits for our dedicated staff
Creates opportunities for employees to have a bigger stake in our organization
Allows us to accept donations from community members and/or funders in a trust
Enables us to access to grants and other streams of funding 
Expands our reach through collaboration with other organizations and providing their members treatment subsidies  
Will generate funding for future satellite locations on Vancouver Island and beyond
Breaks new ground by becoming a non-profit organization providing full-time community acupuncture and alternative/holistic health services
Serves as a potential model/case study for other like-minded organizations to undergo a similar process
Is a stepping stone to pursuing charitable status in the future
This is a huge step towards the longevity and sustainability of providing compassionate, accessible acupuncture services in the Greater Victoria Area and beyond.Help us build Heart & Hands 2.0!  Other ways to support us!

<h2>What We Do</h2>
<p>The Ilan Lev Method (ILM) is a revolutionary form of hands on bodywork developed by master healer and therapist, Ilan Lev.  The Method brings an explosion of movement, life force energy, playful provocation, and joy to the body. This creates the environment in which the body's natural ability to heal itself can arise. We discover optimal range of motion, efficiency of effort, and a new understanding of ourselves, through play.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570218200/p0zztqfakrmxayunxemm.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Photo by Cristina Crippa</p>
<p>The practitioner brings gentle, effortless movement to the client’s body allowing for a rich and powerful dialog within and between client and practitioner; <strong>like a dance</strong>. This allows new physical pathways and coordinations to emerge or become clearer, old habits to be thrown out, and physical and emotional trauma to be released. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>

</div><div>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>At the heart of ILM is a dialogue with ourselves, others, and the world around us. <strong>The Method has the potential to change the way we approach health, wellness and wholeness, at a moment when deep listening and healing is more essential than ever for our communities and our planet.</strong> We hope that the expansion of this method will create a ripple effect across this country and the world.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">As Ilan often reminds us, <i><strong>""Heal one person, heal the World."" </strong></i></p>
<p>Over the past 5 years, we have been generating a growing interest and awareness of this work here in the States. From virtual obscurity, to an ever expanding group of performers, artists, and seekers of health, who all engage with and are eager to delve deeper into this extraordinary practice. We believe that this community needs to, and deserves to have the opportunity to study the art of movement and healing from this wise man, while he is still <strong>80 years young</strong>, and able to travel. With your support and donations, we will be able to accomplish this.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>              ""I find Ilan's work an amazing gift to dancers and people alike. His work helps the body's own regeneration. It brings movement to blocked areas in the body, it comes with positive energy and sense of joy, it can help quicker recovery from ""fresh injuries"" as well as heal old ones... It helped me to become more efficient with my movement and gave me a more balanced body... His work is intelligent, thoughtful, considerate, and is a constant research of growth for Ilan himself as well as for those he works with.” -Maestro Ohad Naharin, Choreographer, Artistic Director of Batsheva Dance Company</i></p>

This money will help us to afford a location conducive to learning while keeping the tuition for aspiring practitioners affordable. </p>
<p>We began the process of organizing this Training Program three years ago, but the budget has never balanced in such a way that we are able to afford to offer the course, despite the ever-increasing interest in the Method. <strong>With this seed money, we can hire an expert legal team to do everything we can to bring Ilan Lev and the assistants here!</strong></p>

We believe in:</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Oneness Perspective</strong>: We recognize that all of life is a unique expression of the same Divine whole. </p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Neutrality</strong>: The deliberate, conscious stance of nonjudgement.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Free Will</strong>: An awareness of the fact that we alone are responsible for the expression of our lives.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Being Conscious</strong>: We practice a body-centric meditation to help us live consciously and comfortably within our own skin. </p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Assume Love</strong>: We all are doing the best we can in the moment. </p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Honesty</strong>: We promote authenticity and integrity. </p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Playfulness</strong>: To quote Joe Dirt, ""Life is a garden. Dig it.""</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Conscious Altruism</strong>: We encourage supporting others on their journey from an internal wellspring of compassion, not from a sense of external obligation, expectation, or a hope of reward or recognition. </p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Education</strong>: We have decades of spiritual learning and experimentation narrowed down to tools and techniques that work. And we love to share them. </p><h3>Meet the Team</h3><p><strong>Judi Hendricks, Chief Energy Oscillator (CEO): </strong>Born a full-blown touch empath with her psychic abilities up and running, Judi Hendricks spent the first 30 years of her life studying any psychological or energetic discipline she could find to learn to master her own ""gifts."" Having achieved a modicum of success in that, she spent the next three decades teaching and healing healers. An Interfaith Minister, Reiki Master and crystal healer with an international clientele, she thinks of her vocation as ""Psychospirituality,"" teaches in-body meditation, energy, crystal, and sound healing, and offers private clairvoyant sessions to support the sensitive psychics she thinks of as the world's ""canaries."" </p><p><strong>Chris Bourgeois, Director of Operations </strong>is a certified Reiki Master, energy healer, artisan, entrepreneur and practicing clairvoyant. Having completed courses in the Silva Mind Control Method and received certification as a hypnotherapist, Chris' longing for self-improvement and life-long interest in spirituality and the metaphysical has always been her guiding light. In 2008, she began taking meditation classes and working her energy with Judi Hendricks and has been enjoying self-growth and conscious living ever since. An avid reader, she credits her love of mysteries with her ability to notice details and keep organized. She is a collector of crystals and paper and makes art out of her in-home studio, Paper Goddess Studios.  </p><p><strong>Annette Wisniewski, Director of Programming and Learning Strategy </strong>is an international consultant, trainer, author, editor, publisher, musician, professional speaker, pet parent, and proud mom. As a learning strategist, she helps people build knowledge and skills and develop positive outlooks; as a human performance technologist, she helps companies remove performance barriers and establish support systems to enable their employees to thrive; as a spiritual healer, she applies what she knows about learning and development and what she has learned along her own spiritual journey to help others connect more fully with their higher selves - and to have fun along the way.</p><p><strong>Ryan Herrick, Director of Abundance </strong>is a musician, humanitarian, spiritual activist, teacher, healer and homebuilder. Based in North Chicagoland by way of New England, Ryan sojourned to the Midwest to deepen his work as a healer and clairvoyant with Judi Hendricks, Rev. in 2015. No matter the task, Ryan seeks Spirit in all things, and his expanded perspective helps him to create, teach, and heal from a cleaner, more neutral space of compassion. He loves dogs, the outdoors, psychology, and carries a deep passion for Native American rights and advocacy. </p><p> </p><h3>Together, we are synthesizing our years of experience and working to harmonize as a beautiful whole in the creation of the<strong> BlissNinny AiryFairy Woo Woo Wellness Center</strong>.</h3><p> </p><h3>We have decades of learning narrowed down to specific tools that work, and we love to share them with others.</h3><p> </p><h3>We are an urban, suburban, and rural retreat center, offering a refuge and community, weekly throughout the year.</h3><p> </p><p>The world is getting more and more complex each day.

We believe in:Oneness Perspective: We recognize that all of life is a unique expression of the same Divine whole. Neutrality: The deliberate, conscious stance of nonjudgement.Free Will: An awareness of the fact that we alone are responsible for the expression of our lives.Being Conscious: We practice a body-centric meditation to help us live consciously and comfortably within our own skin. Assume Love: We all are doing the best we can in the moment. Honesty: We promote authenticity and integrity. Playfulness: To quote Joe Dirt, ""Life is a garden. Dig it.""Conscious Altruism: We encourage supporting others on their journey from an internal wellspring of compassion, not from a sense of external obligation, expectation, or a hope of reward or recognition. Education: We have decades of spiritual learning and experimentation narrowed down to tools and techniques that work. And we love to share them. Meet the TeamJudi Hendricks, Chief Energy Oscillator (CEO): Born a full-blown touch empath with her psychic abilities up and running, Judi Hendricks spent the first 30 years of her life studying any psychological or energetic discipline she could find to learn to master her own ""gifts."" Having achieved a modicum of success in that, she spent the next three decades teaching and healing healers. An Interfaith Minister, Reiki Master and crystal healer with an international clientele, she thinks of her vocation as ""Psychospirituality,"" teaches in-body meditation, energy, crystal, and sound healing, and offers private clairvoyant sessions to support the sensitive psychics she thinks of as the world's ""canaries."" Chris Bourgeois, Director of Operations is a certified Reiki Master, energy healer, artisan, entrepreneur and practicing clairvoyant. Having completed courses in the Silva Mind Control Method and received certification as a hypnotherapist, Chris' longing for self-improvement and life-long interest in spirituality and the metaphysical has always been her guiding light. In 2008, she began taking meditation classes and working her energy with Judi Hendricks and has been enjoying self-growth and conscious living ever since. An avid reader, she credits her love of mysteries with her ability to notice details and keep organized. She is a collector of crystals and paper and makes art out of her in-home studio, Paper Goddess Studios.  Annette Wisniewski, Director of Programming and Learning Strategy is an international consultant, trainer, author, editor, publisher, musician, professional speaker, pet parent, and proud mom. As a learning strategist, she helps people build knowledge and skills and develop positive outlooks; as a human performance technologist, she helps companies remove performance barriers and establish support systems to enable their employees to thrive; as a spiritual healer, she applies what she knows about learning and development and what she has learned along her own spiritual journey to help others connect more fully with their higher selves - and to have fun along the way.Ryan Herrick, Director of Abundance is a musician, humanitarian, spiritual activist, teacher, healer and homebuilder. Based in North Chicagoland by way of New England, Ryan sojourned to the Midwest to deepen his work as a healer and clairvoyant with Judi Hendricks, Rev. in 2015. No matter the task, Ryan seeks Spirit in all things, and his expanded perspective helps him to create, teach, and heal from a cleaner, more neutral space of compassion. He loves dogs, the outdoors, psychology, and carries a deep passion for Native American rights and advocacy.  Together, we are synthesizing our years of experience and working to harmonize as a beautiful whole in the creation of the BlissNinny AiryFairy Woo Woo Wellness Center. We have decades of learning narrowed down to specific tools that work, and we love to share them with others. We are an urban, suburban, and rural retreat center, offering a refuge and community, weekly throughout the year. The world is getting more and more complex each day. We are creating a place to retreat from the chaos into relaxation and inner wellness, offering ways to bridge this newfound ease into your everyday life until it becomes your new normal. We are bringing over 100 years of combined experience to provide comprehensive emotional and mental wellness services, both one-on-one to individual clients and groups. We primarily teach spiritual tools that impart valuable and practical ways of living in this world now. Among these tools are both time-tested rituals and innovative, leading-edge techniques.Working as a team. Judi, Chris, Annette, Ryan, and Rory will provide a multitude of services, including the following:
Energy Healing including Reiki
Psychic Readings
Tarot Readings
Sound Healing
Guided Meditation
Spiritual Workshops
Personal Breakthroughs
Manifestation Tools
NLP Training
Mindfulness Education

 We have been working tirelessly since February 2019 to make this dream a reality.  Since discussions regarding this idea began, we have drafted our vision and mission statement, as well as a business plan, laying out the framework for The BlissNinny AiryFairy WooWoo Wellness Center and the numerous ways we will support our clients and expand our community.   The Road So Far... 
Consulted with lawyers to lay the groundwork for the legal structure of our business; operating agreements, waivers, and all pertinent legal documents, including trademarks.
Established the BlissNinny AiryFairy WooWoo Wellness Center, LLC as a legal business entity in the State of Illinois on November 19th, 2019.
Created a social networking presence on Facebook and Instagram @blissninnywellness.
Began developing an official website (http://blissninnywellness.com) that will allow for online booking and convenient access to up-to-date information about our extensive offerings.
 We've set our goal at $10,000 for start up costs; which include business consultation fees; LLC formation fees; web hosting and scheduling; marketing; office supplies such as stationary, incense, candles, water, toilet paper, and kleenex; and design services.

<p>Never in a million years did I expect to be teaching yoga. I didn’t know what yoga was (who actually does?) and I almost died through my first heated class. I was grumpy too often, I stretched too little…so how did I end up here? </p>
<p>In 2013, I somehow ended up in teacher training and decided it wouldn't hurt to teach. It was fun. I had no idea what I was doing, but I enjoyed it...however, about a year in something shifted and I fell in love. I realized that if you took away the studio, the poses, the cues...you were left with the incredible energy of total strangers. </p>
<p>It’s funny how big your community gets when you take a moment to stop and take it in. People with different backgrounds, intentions, and journeys all coming together to be apart of something outside of themselves…it's bananas. </p>
<p>We have infinite opportunities to move and to connect if we seize them. For me, yoga has been about the people that it has brought into my life. For you, it may be something different. Together, we can celebrate it all.</p>

</div><div>
<p>rōm is partnering with Yoga4410, a local yin and restorative studio, to create Bethesda Yoga Co-op. rōm will use the studio as its home base to host daily classes in addition to the regular pop-up classes planned at locations (businesses/homes) across the city. </p>
<p>The co-op will serve as a wellness space to connect the community through quality yoga/meditation classes for varying practices. With the power-based flows of rōm and the healing yin style of Yoga4410, students can expect a well-rounded and full yoga experience. </p>
<p>Building rōm and Bethesda Yoga Co-op together has been beyond fun, but the bills add up quickly. We are seeking support to fund initial rental costs, equipment (mats, blocks, and straps), and other start-up expenses that occur when creating a business.</p>

<p>Yoga has become a huge part of our current culture and it’s flipping awesome. Strangers come together, each with a different story, to move around and breathe side-by-side.

It’s funny how big your community gets when you take a moment to stop and take it in. People with different backgrounds, intentions, and journeys all coming together to be apart of something outside of themselves…it's bananas. 
We have infinite opportunities to move and to connect if we seize them. For me, yoga has been about the people that it has brought into my life. For you, it may be something different. Together, we can celebrate it all.

the studio space (the reason for funds!) 

rōm is partnering with Yoga4410, a local yin and restorative studio, to create Bethesda Yoga Co-op. rōm will use the studio as its home base to host daily classes in addition to the regular pop-up classes planned at locations (businesses/homes) across the city. 
The co-op will serve as a wellness space to connect the community through quality yoga/meditation classes for varying practices. With the power-based flows of rōm and the healing yin style of Yoga4410, students can expect a well-rounded and full yoga experience. 
Building rōm and Bethesda Yoga Co-op together has been beyond fun, but the bills add up quickly. We are seeking support to fund initial rental costs, equipment (mats, blocks, and straps), and other start-up expenses that occur when creating a business.
Bethesda Yoga Co-op is located inside of PureRyde Pilates within Bethesda’s Bradley Shopping Center (address). free parking, ya’ll.
The studio opens November 15. breathe in...breathe out...


what else...
Yoga has become a huge part of our current culture and it’s flipping awesome. Strangers come together, each with a different story, to move around and breathe side-by-side. No matter the reason for being on the mat, people show up and we think that’s pretty cool. Our hope is to cultivate growth and connection within individuals and our pack. 
The dream is to create a culture energized by community. All intentions welcome.

<p>As Founder of Sat Nam Spirit Center of Sedona, I have been offering classes and workshops through difference locations for more than 4 years. My goal as been to create an affordable, non-competitive environment that is safe emotionally, physically, and spiritually for as many people as possible no matter what their limits or situation. This includes the elderly, the very young, the physically or mentally challenged, veterans and those in 12 step programs. And those in financial need.</p>

<p>Another important aspect of Sat Nam Spirit Center is community. It’s been very important to me from the start.

As part of the community experience, we aspire to make time and space for those who want to offer their services and teachings or share their art and books at the center. I encourage those with services or events to bring fliers and make announcements. We also have special times where students bring in their art and books to share and sell. We even have someone bring in eggs from her chickens to sell.

We're excited to offer some ""never seen before perks"" that are made possible by the power of a superfund.
OUR PERKS INCLUDE
1) A Matching Donation: Up to 10X to your favorite charity! At perk level BLUE and above you'll get to nominate your favorite charity and at some point over the next two years, Glow will make a donation to that charity in your name. How awesome is that! This will only happen during our Indiegogo campaign and never be repeated again. The charity must be a US 501c3 registered non-profit and cannot be a school or place of worship. (When the campaign ends we will send a charity nomination form).
2) In-App Level Upgrades: When using the app you will receive points for participating in Daily Glow activities, inviting friends, sharing stories on social and many different types of engagement. These points will level you up within the app that will unlock rewards like discounts on adventure travel and products by partner brands as well as other community-related perks.
3) Gift Cards, Books and More: Other perks include items that will inspire you on your generosity journey.

<h2><span style=""background-color: initial;"">FAQ</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>What platforms will Champions of the Shengha be available on?<br/><i>We'll be building the game for Android and iOS devices - phones and tablets. </i><br/> </li>
<li>Have you already finished the game? <br/><i>We've been building CotS for quite a while now, and hundreds of players have used the game, some for over a month. We've still got a fair way to go before it's ready for everyone to play though, and that's why we need your help. We're expecting to release in June 2017.</i>

<li>
<i>​</i><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Will beta testers get the final version of the game?</span><br/><i>Beta testers will have access to all new versions of the game as they are released up to and including the final version, which will be ready by June 2017.</i><br/> </li>
<li>What's the BfB Sensor?<br/><i>The BfB Sensor is a pulse oximeter, a type of sensor which illuminates the skin and measures changes in the light returned. In doing this we measure the volume of blood moving through your body - and so your pulse. It is a bluetooth clip attached to your earlobe, with a small device clipped to your clothes.</i>​<br/> </li>
<li>Do I need a BfB Sensor to play?<br/><i>We recommend playing with a BfB sensor, and the game must be played with some sort of heart rate monitor.

 What do players do in Champions of the Shengha?There’s so much going on this game that it’s hard to fit it onto a campaign page. We’ve tried to condense it down into a handy feature list for you. Compete in DuelsJump into the arena, pick up your cards and fight opponents from around the world. The core of Champions' is a tactical card battling game that's deep and fun. Build Your DeckWith over 100 cards in the starter deck there's plenty of ways to win. Cast colourful Creatures onto the battlefield and equip them with powerful Weapons and Armour. Wield characterful Spells distinct to your tribe and build unique decks to be tested in the temple battlegrounds. Build decks around Joy, Fear or Fury cards - and add Neutral cards to fill out your battle deck. Cast SpellsSpells are powerful cards that can inflict direct damage, heal your wounded, or inflict a host of different effects onto the battlefield. Raise the dead, conjure a dust storm or drive every Creature into a mad rage! Summon CreaturesIn the world of Champions’, Creatures are the physical manifestations of powerful emotional forces left unchecked. Powerful spellcasters can summon them outright themselves. Forge EquipmentUse Weapons and Armour to change the way your creatures fight and respond to new challenges. There are some incredible magical weapons to collect with unique effects on the board that can change a battle completely. Give your enemies cursed weapons that break their abilities. Choose Your TribeThe three tribes of magic are brawling again. Which one do you belong to?Joy champions are expert at using their opponent’s force against them. charm your opponent into laying down arms, or persuade them to never deal a killing blow with mercy. Convert enemy creatures to your cause and have them turn against their former master. A good joy champion will never take a hit at all. Fear champions make their home where others fear to tread - befriending ghosts and gruesome monsters and learning to overcome their own weaknesses. Bring opposing creatures back from the dead as ghosts and send them to battle to terrify your enemies into inaction, or panic them into striking out in the wrong direction. A terrified enemy is a paralysed enemy. Fury champions call on mighty warriors, complicated machines and animals of the wild to communicate their explosive anger. They often get carried away! Rush in, hit hard, and keep the momentum with enraged creatures that just keep going, and a powerful immunity to magic. Don’t give your opponent a chance to recover!

 Support this game in schoolsWe are making the game available for free to our network of partner schools and youth groups in the UK and USA as part of this launch.If you’re going to buy one, why not give one too? Or nominate a class or school to receive a pack of games. BfB LabsChampions of the Shengha was created by BfB Labs, a new social venture that sets out to bring Emotionally Responsive Gaming (ERG) to the world.BfB Labs have spent the last two years researching, developing, designing and testing Champions of Shengha. It has been through three major rounds of prototype development and trialling, and undergone five impact trials.BfB Labs were awarded seed funding from social tech funder The Nominet Trust and in 2014 were selected as a Google Impact Award finalist, receiving funding to develop the game.The TeamWe're a diverse bunch, passionate about making great games, new experiences for our players, and measurable changes to their wellbeing. Simon made his first game when he was 12 on an Amiga. Duncan understands how businesses work and makes sure ours does. Kathleen and Naomi ensure we're on a sound scientific footing. Adam keeps things looking gorgeous, and KJ actually does all the work (but don't tell him!) 
FAQ

What platforms will Champions of the Shengha be available on?We'll be building the game for Android and iOS devices - phones and tablets.  
Have you already finished the game? We've been building CotS for quite a while now, and hundreds of players have used the game, some for over a month. We've still got a fair way to go before it's ready for everyone to play though, and that's why we need your help. We're expecting to release in June 2017.




​Will beta testers get the final version of the game?Beta testers will have access to all new versions of the game as they are released up to and including the final version, which will be ready by June 2017. 
What's the BfB Sensor?The BfB Sensor is a pulse oximeter, a type of sensor which illuminates the skin and measures changes in the light returned. In doing this we measure the volume of blood moving through your body - and so your pulse. It is a bluetooth clip attached to your earlobe, with a small device clipped to your clothes.​ 
Do I need a BfB Sensor to play?We recommend playing with a BfB sensor, and the game must be played with some sort of heart rate monitor. If you have BTLE enabled chest strap like the Polar H7 you'll be able to use that. We can't guarantee a great experience with any sensor other than our own.  
How will I get new cards in Champions of the Shengha?You'll be able to earn new cards through playing. We will also sell booster packs of random cards in the app. Once we're up and running we'll be launching card sets throughout the year which offer new ways to play and interact.  
Are there physical cards?The game is played 100% digitally. If you buy the 'Choose your tribe' perk you'll get a limited edition run of 15 full colour printed cards belonging to the tribe of your choice, and a code to unlock those cards in the game. ​",17.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Two million refugee infants are dying annually due to causes such as malaria, pneumonia, and malnutrition. These are deaths that can be solved by a simple solution: mother’s milk. We are the world’s first globally commercialized breast milk donation service. We offer preventative health care to eliminate refugee infant mortality through accessible and affordable breast-milk. We reduce infant mortality rates and empower mothers and families by reducing their weekly food-cost expenses.</p>
<p>We are Milky Way and we leverage one of the most powerful relationships in the world - that of a mother and her child. We are the world’s first commercial breast milk service. We offer affordable and accessible breast-milk to eliminate infant mortality and empower families.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<p>&gt; Packaging</p>
<p>&gt;Transportation</p>
<p>&gt;Setting up pasteurization infrastructure</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Once we are able to set up our first milk bank through the help of our strategic NGO partners, we will begin on boarding donors. All funding (even if the goal isn't reached) towards setting up our pilot milk banks in London, Ontario. </li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Through your donation, Milky Way is able to create meaningful gains for society by reducing childhood mortality rates. Families can now save anywhere between 50-75% on food costs for their infants and children in marginalized communities can now grow up to contribute upwards of $1.8B to their local economies. Milky Way aims to bridge the gaps between all members of society by providing the right nutritional tools for a healthy and equitable future. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are socio-cultural considerations that are resulting from the adoption of such a progressive business model into mainstream society. Milky Way is currently working to raise awareness about the breast milk donation movement and getting mainstream society and media attention in regards to this phenomena. Awareness leads to adoption and the more people know about what Milky Way is trying to do, we project that the more people will want to get involved. Additionally, performing in a B2B framework will mean that Milky Way’s financial success in terms of sales growth and profitability will be entirely contingent on partner NGOs receiving sponsorships, donations and funding. To combat this issue, Milky Way instituted a subscription model wherein the cost is spread over a certain period of time to ensure that NGOs don’t become financially overextended.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>For more opportunities on how to get involved, please like our Facebook page to keep updated with our campaigns and our progress! We appreciate every like and share as it goes towards creating awareness on not only the breast milk donation movement but how everyone can do their part in creating a healthier future for the world's most underserved people. </p>

Break it down for folks in more detail:
> Packaging
>Transportation
>Setting up pasteurization infrastructure
 
Once we are able to set up our first milk bank through the help of our strategic NGO partners, we will begin on boarding donors. All funding (even if the goal isn't reached) towards setting up our pilot milk banks in London, Ontario. 

 
The Impact
Through your donation, Milky Way is able to create meaningful gains for society by reducing childhood mortality rates. Families can now save anywhere between 50-75% on food costs for their infants and children in marginalized communities can now grow up to contribute upwards of $1.8B to their local economies. Milky Way aims to bridge the gaps between all members of society by providing the right nutritional tools for a healthy and equitable future. 

Risks & Challenges
There are socio-cultural considerations that are resulting from the adoption of such a progressive business model into mainstream society. Milky Way is currently working to raise awareness about the breast milk donation movement and getting mainstream society and media attention in regards to this phenomena. Awareness leads to adoption and the more people know about what Milky Way is trying to do, we project that the more people will want to get involved. Additionally, performing in a B2B framework will mean that Milky Way’s financial success in terms of sales growth and profitability will be entirely contingent on partner NGOs receiving sponsorships, donations and funding. To combat this issue, Milky Way instituted a subscription model wherein the cost is spread over a certain period of time to ensure that NGOs don’t become financially overextended.

Le Qi Gong (prononcer ""Tchi Gong"") est un moyen facile et accessible:- d'exercer votre corps- d'améliorer votre santé et votre longévité- d'évacuer vos toxines- de réduire votre stress- d'améliorer votre circulation sanguine et énergétique- de rétablir la balance entre votre Yin et votre Yang, entre les énergies de Feu et d'Eau, et entre votre esprit et votre corps.
Bonjour, mon nom est Rafael. Je suis Français et je passe six mois par an en Thaïlande, où j'enseigne le Qi Gong.J'ai 15 ans d’expérience et d’intérêt en bouddhisme et philosophie orientale, incluant Qi Gong, Tai Chi Chuan, taoïsme, théologie, méditation bouddhique et taoïste, et médecine naturelle.Ma formation comprend du Tai Chi Chuan, du Hatha Yoga, du Qi Gong, des enseignements bouddhiques, de la méditation bouddhique et du Reiki.
Le but de cette campagne est de produire une méthode de Qi Gong facile à apprendre pour vous permettre de pratiquer seul(e) dans votre vie quotidienne. Basée sur le stage de Qi Gong que j'enseigne depuis six ans, la méthose comprend des exercices de respiration et d'échauffement, des exercices de mouvement en postion debout, ainsi que des exercices à pratiquer en position assise (méditation).Cette «Méthode Élémentaire pour la pratique du Qi Gong» se présentera sous le forme d'une vidéo, avec un choix de plusieurs bandes sonores: voix off avec des instructions en anglais ou en français (pour les débutants), ou musique et sons de la nature (pour les étudiants avancés). La vidéo sera tounée en Haute Définition.Le livret de 24 pages l'accompagnant vous donnera également des instructions claires, avec des détails comme les positions à adopter, les principes à suivre, ainsi que plusieurs méditations assises.
En fait, vous aurez tout ce dont vous avez besoin pour votre pratique quotidienne ou hebdomadaire.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Crowds, schedules, the immediacy of once-a-year events and other stressors common at conventions and expos can be triggers for many emotional issues, especially anxiety and depression. People dealing with mental health issues (and even many who aren't) rely on the Take This AFK Rooms for taking a break and escaping the bustle of a crowded con. If Take This can't reach its funding goal to provide these AFK Rooms, most of the attendees, exhibitors, and staff who rely on these rooms will left to fend for themselves.</p>
<p>More than a quiet room, the Take This AFK Room is a calming space for people who need it, staffed with volunteers and clinicians who can answer questions and offer support for people who are stressed out. Some visitors simply need a break from the excitement and stimulation of a large event. Others seek conversation about mental health related issues. Still others check in to support us and our mission. We are happy to meet you all.</p>
<p>Since Spring 2014, Take This has hosted AFK Rooms at every North American PAX event, with around 500 visitors per day. Starting in 2015, the AFK Room has been available at every PAX worldwide, and we’ve brought it to many other events as well.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Over 2,000 people just in 2016 visited AFK Rooms at conventions worldwide. And many attendees tell us they are more likely to attend a con if it has an AFK Room.</p>
<p>Here is what some of our visitors have to say about their experiences in the AFK Rooms (all feedback is anonymous and unsolicited):</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>""I love it... I wish I knew about it earlier.""</strong></p>

<h3>Where the Money Goes</h3>
<p>Take This is a small organization, and we run a tight ship. That having been said, running a traveling mental health educational and awareness-raising clinic year-round, across the globe is an expensive proposition.</p>
<p>We're asking for $200,000.</p>
<p>That covers establishing an AFK Room at the 7 major conventions we attend every year, plus bringing on up to five additional conventions within the next year.</p>
<p>Some of the major conventions where we manage an AFK Room are able to reimburse Take This for our costs (airfare, hotels, feeding people, licensed mental health workers, printing, coloring books, and other materials), but most of them aren't able to do so. And many of the smaller, less well-endowed conventions actually require more of our time and resources. So expanding the AFK Program to new conventions gets real expensive real fast.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484336047/udrlrtvpbhhieh6iqjbb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Here's a quick breakdown of what it takes to run a Take This AFK Room:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Assessment</strong>: Before even starting to establish an AFK Room, Take This sends an Assessment Team to visit the convention and meet its organizers. There are many factors which might make a convention incompatible with the Take This mission, and this assessment period is vital to ensuring that our volunteers and visitors will get the care and protection they need. The Take This team then conducts a thorough analysis of a given convention, how an AFK Room will benefit the convention's attendees, and how the Take This team can work with that convention's staff to make the show more welcoming to attendees with mental health issues.</li>
<li>
<strong>Recruitment</strong>: This step is the hardest. For every city where Take This hosts an AFK Room, we must establish a brand new network of like-minded clinicians and begin recruiting and training for staffing the AFK Room. Our AFK Room is fully staffed with mental health care workers, many of them licensed to practice in their particular state. Take This will often recruit a clinical coordinator, someone who is a veteran care worker in their area who can help recruit like-minded clinicians. We then thoroughly vet each care worker to ensure they are compatible with our mission and our gamer community, then conduct a series of training sessions to prepare them for staffing the AFK Room. Many of our first-time clinicians have never been to a gaming convention, and we must prepare them not only for the tasks they will be required to perform for us, but in some cases the disorientating cultural shock of immersing themselves in a convention for the first time. </li>
<li>
<strong>Consulting</strong>: One of the lesser-known aspects of the AFK Program is our work with convention staffs in training them how to provide basic attention to attendees, exhibitors, and fellow staff members dealing with mental health issues. This training was at one time optional, but has since become mandatory (at our convention partners' requests) at every convention where Take This manages an AFK Room. This training session provides not only basic mental health awareness, but simple and effective techniques and tools for helping everyone have a better experience at a convention.</li>
<li>
<strong>Set-up</strong>: The weeks prior to a convention, the Take This team gathers its training materials, AFK Room amenities (like coloring books, stress squeezers, facial tissue, etc.), volunteer t-shirts, radios, gaff tape, sharpies, and more, loads up ""the Big Box"" and ships out to the city where we are working. The Take This team is located all over the country — and so are our materials. Transport (for both people and things) is one of our biggest costs. We must then establish a livable space for our team and volunteers for the week of an event.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our ""hard costs"" for running an AFK Room (airplane tickets, hotel rooms, clinician compensation, equipment, etc.) average at around $10,000 per show, and in some cases even more. To compensate and feed our Take This staff members during the week spent working and living away from their families adds roughly $5,000 per show. </p>
<p>Which means that to accommodate just the seven events already on our recurring AFK schedule costs Take This over $100,000 per year. And most of those costs are not reimbursed by our partner conventions. </p>
<p>To add additional conventions to the AFK Program requires months of prep work and unavoidable start-up costs, bringing the total for a first-time AFK Room closer to $20,000. </p>
<p>Meeting our campaign goal will allow Take This to fully-fund the AFK Program for an entire year, serving our seven existing partner shows, and expanding the program by up to <strong>five new shows in a year</strong>.</p>

<h3>Moving Forward with the Feldenkrais Method: Flexibility, Balance and Pain Relief for Seniors</h3>
<p>The Feldenkrais Foundation is raising money to bring our 12-class series, <i>Moving Forward with the Feldenkrais Method</i>, to senior centers throughout New York City:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Feldenkrais Foundation is a non-profit organization founded in 2008 to promote greater awareness and exposure to the Feldenkrais Method, focusing specifically on low-income neighborhoods and individuals who would not be able to afford this service otherwise.</li>
<li>These classes, specifically designed for the senior population, have been proven to help seniors with balance, pain management, and mobility.</li>
<li>Your donation will help us better the lives of hundreds of seniors who would otherwise have no access to classes.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What does this series cost?:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every series of 12 classes costs the Feldenkrais Foundation over one thousand dollars.  The Foundation provides one lead teacher and one assistant teacher at every site, as well as printed materials and props for class.</li>
<li>Donors will receive the following perks for each donation level (all tax deductible):</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>A Life in Movement - Moshe Feldenkrais Biography</strong> (donate $100 or more)</li>

<ul>
<li>Feldenkrais is gentle, easy to do, and the benefits can be immediate, making it a great modality for the older adult.</li>
<li>The Feldenkrais Foundation has run this class series in three boroughs and in over 15 different senior centers.  Our wonderful client testimony speaks for itself: ""I am deeply impressed by the Feldenkrais exercises. I am 78 years old and can’t handle most exercise programs. But, the Feldenkrais exercises are the most effective, easy to follow system I have ever tried. It is amazing how quickly there is an improvement."" –Edith W</li>
<li>A recent study facilitated by David Zemach-Bersin (Founder and President of the Feldenkrais Foundation) and Carolyn Palmer (Certified Feldenkrais Practitioner) indicates that those who attended the Moving Forward program for a 6 or 12-week series showed better balance and flexibility.  In addition to offering older adults valuable balance and flexibility practice, Feldenkrais Moving Forward classes also provide neuromuscular support for improving movement in many aspects of daily life and self-use. </li>

When I was diagnosed with 7 different severe food allergies and over 20 other food sensitivities, I thought food would never be fun or tasty again. I felt lonely and frustrated (and a bit peckish). Eating yummy food shouldn't have to end in a trip to the emergency room. It got me to thinking, how can I help? As I was figuring out how to make an impact as an actress in the industry, my acting coach asked me “What makes you stand out? How do you make an impact?” My response-my personality and my food allergies. Everyone from fellow actors to showrunners approached me about my dietary restrictions on set and how I took care of myself. It was not just on set, I’ve had family and friends asking for help for years on how to cook for a loved one with allergies or how to eat a little cleaner in their own lives. So I figured, the best way to help as many people as I could eat better food and learn how to safely cook for others was to show them! Now I bring you 15 years of experience switching, swapping and experimenting to anyone who suffers from restrictive dietary intolerances. After starting out with just a video camera and a can-do attitude, I'm excited to announce I've been picked up for distribution! It is so exciting to have the opportunity to reach a bigger audience, but this means I have to be bigger, too. Which means out of pocket production costs for the first year of distributing until a larger audience is established.</p><p>Distributors Allergy Actress Cooking Just Signed With:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485839669/zhf1pmfk0kgvb9pljhwz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>       <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485839799/umzjt8bkzarencpocxun.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Check out our <a href=""http://fb.me/allergyactresscooking"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook page! </a></p><h2>Pledges and Rewards</h2><p>Below is a chart of a few of our perks for donating.

She is an actress, voiceover artist, and musician living in Los Angeles and she loves to cook! Her need to feed herself and her desire to touch other peoples lives through her craft led her to create Allergy Actress Cooking in hopes that it would bring some ease to a diagnosis that can often be a very difficult change to life. Having worked with so many wonderful special guests on her show already, she hopes to expand the show to encompass all dietary needs in an effort to contribute to educating about maintaining a healthy life balance without feeling deprived of what life has to offer. Previous credits in the industry include: a starring role in the multiple award winning feature film ""Glimpse"" (soon to be out on Amazon), supporting roles in award winning short films ""Morning Announcements"" (aired on World Humanitarian Day in Geneva at the UN) and ""You + Me"" (Cannes Film Festival selection 2016 and now in worldwide distribution), and several featured and guest star roles on television in such shows as ""My Crazy Ex"" on Lifetime and ""Parents Just Don't Understand"" on the HUB Network.

<h2>From Dr. Rosalind Ambrose, President of the SVG Medical Association:</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our Patients Need A Lifeline</h3>
<p>I am Dr.Rosalind Ambrose, President of the St.Vincent and the Grenadines Medical Association, who annually for the past 11 years, have forged a powerful public campaign for building awareness about breast and prostate cancer. Therefore, we decided to ""put our Strengths together"". My campaign is one of great significance, because it seeks to acquire  financial contributions to establish an oncology centre here in St. Vincent and the Grenadines.  Currently, the cost is prohibitive and access to treatment centres (typically Trinidad) becomes an even costly venture. The magnitude of the contribution is potentially large,  because the cost of chemotherapy agents alone is very prohibitive for most patients.  Added to this is the cost of travelling to Trinidad which is the most accessible location. Patients commonly default and DIE as a result.  However, our organisation sees the way to change that awful dynamic - we must establish an Oncology Treatment Centre - here at home to Throw a Lifeline to our Cancer patients. </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We believe that we can get off the ground with approximately $250,000USD for the number of patients who are waiting to be assisted.  Although our location would need beds, and all the necessary furnishings for the conducive treatment atmosphere, we believe that we can solicit some of those from friendly local (and diaspora) sources.  The major part of the funding will go towards the purchase of chemotherapy agents, consumables and staffing--although we anticipate that some staffing would be voluntary.  We are continuing our search for cheaper sources in the meantime.</p>
<p>We have a visible  'track-record' of  bringing successful projects to a positive end. We are aiming to improve the survival rate of breast and prostate cancer patients.  Trust is demonstrated in other community services which our organisation has been providing over the years.  We have a long and credible history of administering funding to the directed source.</p>
<p>COME and visit. Our unique perks can be seen in the video - A country where our perspective contributors and investors can come to relax, where people can truly have the natural ambience to recuperate. Warm hospitable communities will be grateful for the survival of their friends, neighbours, relatives who are affected by cancer but see HOPE literally - on the Horizon - right in their own backyard. They would be at home where family support is paramount.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, we will continue to give that financial assistance to our cancer  patients - to assist as many of them as we can - in the manner of our 'historical  and ongoing' program of helping to pay for 'one treatment at a time'.  When that is exhausted, I suppose our survival 'statistical graph' will return to sad days we had BEFORE crowdfunding became our option and our HOPE. </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The IMPACT is to give health and longevity to any 38 year old mother of 3 giving her a chance to see her kids grow up and to support them in every way that mothers dream about.  The IMPACT is to see a father being available and able to be sufficiently healthy and well to watch his sons and daughters graduate from high school, college and university.  To continue to be the breadwinner HE has always dream about, TO GIVE FAMILIES HOPE , HEALTH, and a FUTURE. We aim to improve the quality of life and to SAVE LIVES of the persons affected by breast and prostate cancer. </p>
<p>Our organisation has a track record of success.  About 10 years ago, we championed a NO SMOKING Campaign. We were able to encourage businesses to post visible SMOKE-FREE  signs, we mounted billboards, and ran public service ads on local TV.  We received an award from PAHO-WHO for the great work that we did.</p>
<p>Please see our website (<a href=""http://www.svgmeda.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.svgmeda.com</a>)  for annual PINK CAP CITY WALK, and more recently our annual 5K run - which are fundraising drives. Because of our Breast Cancer Awareness program (1990 - present), women are better educated on Breast Self Examinations, better educated on what to look for in the breast, more women voluntarily present themselves for mammography each year.  Our problem is - that once diagnosed, and surgery has taken place, the COST &amp; ACCESS to Oncology Treatment becomes a virtual Mt. Everest and patients are not able to cope with the cost of meds, cost of travel and daily cost of life demands for them and their families. THEN the big sacrifice steps in when they must chose between cost of treatment and demands on the family. They then default and die. </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The greatest challenge we anticipate is when funds are not available for the purchase of specifically required chemotherapy agents. Often times, the TIMING for RECEIVING orders for medicines can become a problem, and them we must resort to using courier services which cost MORE for bringing into this type of merchandise into the country. We have concerns as well about the SUSTAINABILITY of the project, because our fundraising efforts  can NEVER really reach the budgets needed for a sustainable project.  The patients are NOT economically able to contribute what the financial needs really are for a centre of this kind.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please Throw Our Patients a LIFELINE ! If you are not able to contribute financially you can help us to ""GET THE WORD ON"" to other potential contributors, philanthropists, well-wishers. You can contribute valuable TIME to send out correspondence and connect with other hopeful contributors. Utilize the Indiegogo share tools and share with your network!</p>
<p>Also give us some prayers and supporting words. </p>
<p>Thank you so much!</p>

<h2><strong>Short Summary</strong></h2>
<p>Garden Shark is a heartfelt documentary that captures how improv brings new hope and meaning to the lives of people affected by dementia. Help us fund an improv class for caregivers and the people they are caring for so we can share improv’s innate ability to remove expectations, celebrate one another and enhance communication.  </p> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576553544/hdsqneezhgfavhzhqibx.png"" src=""""/></p> <h2><strong>Garden Shark</strong></h2>
<p>Garden Shark follows Inside Out Theatre’s improv facilitators as they teach caregivers, medical professionals and family members the ability to live in the moment and learn to laugh in spite of the effects of the disease. The program is designed to give respite to at home caregivers while providing meaningful activities for people with dementia. The facilitators’ ability to communicate, listen to and laugh with the people participating in the program has inspired us to make it possible for caregivers to learn these skills as well!</p> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576553574/rkfaufevyawy5fssa0ka.png"" src=""""/></p> <h2><strong>What We Need</strong></h2>
<p>We need the funds to host, facilitate and film a free improv class for caregivers and the people they are caring for living with dementia. This will allow us to share the beautiful power of improv with our wider audience. </p> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576553599/rvtgxkmohjje6dumkrtk.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Why Improv?</strong></h2>
<p>The beauty of improv is that it’s all about saying ‘YES, AND!’ and being present in the moment. Memory isn’t required and in improv’s failure-free environment, there are no bad ideas, only creative potential and a willingness to connect. For someone with memory loss, this is a very safe place to be. Even if confusion creeps in, the group just goes with it. Improv celebrates self-expression, removes judgment and reminds us of the powers of imagination and laughter. Improv allows us to see the individual, instead of the disease. </p>
<p><i>“The goal of the program is to bring an hour of life, laughter, joy and creativity into the lives of folks dealing with a really difficult part of their life. And to do it in a way that sets them up for success. Create a program that plays to their strengths and identifies them as creative, intelligent, funny people.” - <strong>Col Cseke</strong>, co-creator of Inside Out Theatre’s Village Improv for Alzheimer’s Program (VIA)</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576553620/p05fylg3gue5mjtwfnbe.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Why is This Class so Important to the Documentary?</strong></h2>
<p>Throughout the filming of improv classes designed for those living with dementia, we’ve had the opportunity to witness these people being creative, collectively telling stories, stepping out of their comfort zones, making others laugh, trying things without judgement and communicating in new ways. The skills of improv can be learned and we want to give caregivers the opportunity to experience this with the people they are caring for. </p> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576557808/fhblogizfhymymjveitv.png"" src=""""/></p> <h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p><i>“Currently, more than 42,000 Albertans are living with dementia. This number is expected to increase to more than 155,000 within 30 years. Dementia doesn’t just affect the person with the diagnosis, it also directly impacts 10 – 12 individuals. Most care to a person diagnosed is provided by a spouse or family member. Caregivers provide more than 18 million hours of unpaid care to Albertans living with dementia each year. By 2038, this number is expected to increase to 68 million hours if nothing changes.” - <strong>Gordie Howe C.A.R.E.S.</strong> 2017-18 Community Report</i></p>
<p>Improv is being identified as a tool to improve the lives of adults diagnosed with dementia. Raising awareness and promoting the adaptation of creative care, such as improv, throughout the healthcare system and at home is one of our ultimate goals. By supporting the people that are pioneering this form of care, Garden Shark can bring the local improv and other artist communities (music, poetry, painting) closer to those living with dementia. We also hope to inspire other communities, organizations and countries to consider improv and creative care as a means of medicine, connection and growth.</p>
<p>Improv is one of many forms of creative care and we would love for Garden Shark to redefine what it means to have dementia and bring hope to those faced with this difficult disease. </p> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576553746/jqdecov6hqmgfffvzzbx.png"" src=""""/></p>

Garden Shark is a heartfelt documentary that captures how improv brings new hope and meaning to the lives of people affected by dementia. Help us fund an improv class for caregivers and the people they are caring for so we can share improv’s innate ability to remove expectations, celebrate one another and enhance communication.    Garden Shark
Garden Shark follows Inside Out Theatre’s improv facilitators as they teach caregivers, medical professionals and family members the ability to live in the moment and learn to laugh in spite of the effects of the disease. The program is designed to give respite to at home caregivers while providing meaningful activities for people with dementia. The facilitators’ ability to communicate, listen to and laugh with the people participating in the program has inspired us to make it possible for caregivers to learn these skills as well!  What We Need
We need the funds to host, facilitate and film a free improv class for caregivers and the people they are caring for living with dementia. This will allow us to share the beautiful power of improv with our wider audience.  
 
Why Improv?
The beauty of improv is that it’s all about saying ‘YES, AND!’ and being present in the moment. Memory isn’t required and in improv’s failure-free environment, there are no bad ideas, only creative potential and a willingness to connect. For someone with memory loss, this is a very safe place to be. Even if confusion creeps in, the group just goes with it. Improv celebrates self-expression, removes judgment and reminds us of the powers of imagination and laughter. Improv allows us to see the individual, instead of the disease. 
“The goal of the program is to bring an hour of life, laughter, joy and creativity into the lives of folks dealing with a really difficult part of their life. And to do it in a way that sets them up for success. Create a program that plays to their strengths and identifies them as creative, intelligent, funny people.” - Col Cseke, co-creator of Inside Out Theatre’s Village Improv for Alzheimer’s Program (VIA)
 

 
Why is This Class so Important to the Documentary?
Throughout the filming of improv classes designed for those living with dementia, we’ve had the opportunity to witness these people being creative, collectively telling stories, stepping out of their comfort zones, making others laugh, trying things without judgement and communicating in new ways. The skills of improv can be learned and we want to give caregivers the opportunity to experience this with the people they are caring for.   The Impact
“Currently, more than 42,000 Albertans are living with dementia. This number is expected to increase to more than 155,000 within 30 years. Dementia doesn’t just affect the person with the diagnosis, it also directly impacts 10 – 12 individuals. Most care to a person diagnosed is provided by a spouse or family member. Caregivers provide more than 18 million hours of unpaid care to Albertans living with dementia each year. By 2038, this number is expected to increase to 68 million hours if nothing changes.” - Gordie Howe C.A.R.E.S. 2017-18 Community Report
Improv is being identified as a tool to improve the lives of adults diagnosed with dementia. Raising awareness and promoting the adaptation of creative care, such as improv, throughout the healthcare system and at home is one of our ultimate goals. By supporting the people that are pioneering this form of care, Garden Shark can bring the local improv and other artist communities (music, poetry, painting) closer to those living with dementia. We also hope to inspire other communities, organizations and countries to consider improv and creative care as a means of medicine, connection and growth.
Improv is one of many forms of creative care and we would love for Garden Shark to redefine what it means to have dementia and bring hope to those faced with this difficult disease.  
 
“You treat a disease, you win, you lose. You treat a person, I guarantee you, you’ll always win, no matter what the outcome.” - Patch Adams

<p>The longest ongoing mindfulness camp for young people, the <strong>Tools for Peace Summer Teen Camp</strong> offers youth ages 12-16 a transformative, sleepaway experience rooted in practicing <strong>mindfulness</strong> and cultivating <strong>compassion</strong>.</p>
<p>What makes the TFP camp truly unique is the <strong>Stop, Breathe &amp; Think Workshop</strong>. There, campers meet daily in dynamic small discussion groups and learn and practice mindfulness. They also connect with their peers in a safe and supportive environment.</p>
<p>In addition to mindfulness practice, we make lots of time for fun, exercise, and creativity. Daytime activities include <strong>art</strong>,<strong> sports</strong>,<strong> yoga</strong>,<strong> music</strong>,<strong> crafts</strong>,<strong> swimming</strong>, and the creation of a <strong>Community Sand Mandala</strong>. Evenings at camp are always a highlight for campers—with <strong>campfires</strong>, <strong>movie nights</strong>, and <strong>karaoke</strong>. And it all happens in the tranquil mountains of Tehachapi, California.</p>

<p><i>“The prices in L.A. are very high. We have to be careful about our power bill, and I’ve been to the doctor only once or twice in my life.

<p>She says Tools for Peace and her time at camp are a big part of being able to cope.</p>
<p><i>“Camp’s been extremely helpful. When I’m feeling stressed, I know I can give myself a break. It’s O.K. to just stop, breathe, think and just relax. Camp also makes me more aware of what I have that is good. It filters all the bad out, and it’s a way to start a new beginning.</i></p>

Layer cyber-bullying and intense peer pressure on top of raging hormones and hours of homework, and it’s no wonder that 25% of teenagers struggle with anxiety.The TouchPoint Solution founders were so moved by this issue that they developed TouchPoints, wearable devices that alleviate stress in as few as 30 seconds.As a proud Club Alum TouchPoint CEO Vicki Mayo is partnering with BGCA Alumni program to give back to the organization that gave her so much. With this ""Buy One, Give One"" campaign, you can help integrate TouchPoints into clubs throughout the country while getting a tax deduction and stress relief for yourself!TouchPoints are twin neuroscience wearables that provide calming vibrations for stressful situations. Derived from a successful component of EMDR therapy, TouchPoints use BLAST (bi-lateral alternating stimulation tactile) technology to passively reduce stress by over 70% in as few as 30 seconds while you go about your day. Reducing stress also helps to improve sleep quality, focus, and work or school performance - empowering you to live your best, less-stressed life. Learn more at ilovetouchpoints.com.Together, we can cover the map and spread this stress-relieving technology to thousands of kids suffering from childhood anxiety. Your donation will touch the lives of hundreds of children at Clubs and help set them on the path to living their best lives because when they're less stressed, they're capable of achieving so much. This simple tool, backed by neuroscience research and technology, puts the power of stress relief in the palm of their hands.Your contribution will be made even more meaningful because each week you'll get to vote to choose which state to send TouchPoints to. By the end of this campaign, we hope to bring stress relief to Clubs in every single state, starting with our home state of Arizona.For more than 150 years, Boys & Girls Clubs of America has enabled young people most in need to achieve great futures as productive, caring, responsible citizens. Today, more than 4,300 Clubs serve nearly 4 million young people annually, providing a safe place for kids and teens to learn and grow. For an estimated 16 million Club alumni around the world, the Club was not only a second home, it was a game changer. In a Harris Survey of alumni, 54 percent said the Club saved their lives, propelling them to success. Learn more at www.BGCA.org.TouchPoints are embedded with patent-pending bilateral alternating stimulation tactile (BLAST) technology derived from leading neuropsychologist and co-founder Dr. Amy Serin's decade's worth of research on managing anxiety in conjunction with EMDR therapy.TouchPoints use BLAST in the form of gentle, alternating vibrations to alter the brain’s stress response and shift you into the logical, rational part of your brain - allowing you to think clearly and experience calm all within seconds. This also alleviates the body sensations associated with stress (ex. stomach ache, headache). The brain’s ability to restore calm creates new neural pathways - reducing future stress in similar situations. Neuropsychologist Dr. Amy Serin has spent over a decade as an EMDR therapist researching methods and tools for managing stress and anxiety. She had a breakthrough realization that BLAST technology, a component of successful EMDR treatment for PTSD, could be actually be embedded in consumer-friendly wearable devices that could be used outside of the doctor's office to relieve stress anytime and anywhere.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Phylicia Darling and I'm a certified Life Coach. My wife and I are starting a business to bring the things I've learned in my life and from my education to anyone seeking to enrich their life, improve their relationships, and to find fulfillment for themselves. My background is in Social Work, of which I have a bachelors degree. During my time in school, I studied several approaches to human behavior and therapeutic modalities. After graduating, I began working in drug treatment and mental health and became certified in Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT). DBT is a great model to help anyone elevate their lives and address the limitations they are putting on themselves. DBT and the things I've learned in my certification course, inspired the content and Tracks we are creating for Darling Life Coaching. Along with my formal training, I also have my own personal journey that I've learned from. For a long time, I only learned the hard way, which meant a lot of hard lessons. By getting through the difficulties in my life, I have found not only what balance means to me, but how much work goes into maintaining that balance. </p>
<p>In a lot of ways, being a Life Coach is my dream job. I am a people collector and care deeply for everyone I meet. I have had amazing people in my life to help teach me about myself, and I want to do the same for others and give them the resources they need to grow into who they want to be while obtaining their goals. By helping fund our start up costs, you will not only be contributing to helping me make my dreams a reality, but you will be giving to my future clients and the investments they make into their futures and the countless others whose lives they will better along the way. </p>
<p>From our family to yours, thank you so much for investing in our future and the futures of so many others!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are hoping to raise $5,000 to start our business. All funds will go to start up costs to help get us off the ground, such as webhosting and domain, licensing and legal, CRM annual cost, insurance, and some marketing funds. If we reach our goal, a portion of the funds will go toward the fees for my wife and I legally changing our last name to Darling (something we've wanted to do since we were married and to help streamline certain business aspects). Come on, you know you want to be a part of that! </p>
<p>Now we aren't asking for funds for nothing, we have some pretty great perks. My wife and I have a few talents that we think are worth a buck or two, and we hope you find one to suit your generosity. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact we stand to make with our business, is what makes me so deeply passionate, and spurs my desire to create Darling Life Coaching. In my time working with others, I have been trusted to participate in what, for many, becomes a life-changing process. I have witnessed first-hand, many individuals reclaim their lives and begin to experience genuine happiness and success. When someone decides to seek out our services, they will learn and obtain all these different skills and tools that they will take out into their life, utilize, and see sustainable results from. I guarantee, it works if you work it!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The largest hurdle in this process, has been believing that my wife and I can start our own business. Luckily, that is only my hurdle, as she is a rockstar that believes she can do anything. In the time since, we have had several conversations regarding risk factors, and putting solid plans in place to overcome those hurdles and potential hurdles. For instance, a big question we asked ourselves was ""How do we maintain constant clientele?"" To which we have responded by generating verbal interest with several of our friends, family members, and acquaintances. The interest and response has been overwhelming.  Hurdles in starting and running your own business are inevitable and necessary. We feel confident to utilize the skills we will be teaching to others to overcome any obstacles in our path.</p>

To which we have responded by generating verbal interest with several of our friends, family members, and acquaintances. The interest and response has been overwhelming.  Hurdles in starting and running your own business are inevitable and necessary. We feel confident to utilize the skills we will be teaching to others to overcome any obstacles in our path.

<h3>Need a Work Reboot? </h3>
<p>We spend our lives at work. There's no reason for them to be miserable. And yet too many people dread heading into the office each morning. That could be for any number of reasons, like: </p>
<ul>
<li>You're not in a position that aligns with your professional passion;</li>
<li>You're not valued for the skills you bring to the table, or empowered in your role;</li>
<li>You work with toxic co-workers or managers - the narcissists and bullies of the world that do nothing but bring people down.</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of those statements ring true for you then Work Reboot can help get you in a better place. It's a 3 month virtual program that will empower you to create a professional experience that you can be excited about. The program includes 12 live weekly meetings via video conference, homework in between, and access to an exclusive community group where you can interact with other members in the program during and after our work together. </p>
<p>Here's the journey you'll take: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Part 1: Who you are</strong>. You've spent years (perhaps decades) in the position you're in, and that leaves a lot of baggage to take care of. The first month is about peeling back all the layers and re-discovering who you are, what makes you happy, and building your confidence to set you up for success. </li>
<li>
<strong>Part 2: Chart your course.</strong> In month two, we shape your future, including creating a clear idea of your ideal professional experience, shaping a plan to help you achieve it (inside or outside of your current organization), and building a strategy for you to achieve and maintain work/life balance. </li>
<li>
<strong>Part 3: Stay on track. </strong>Our last month is all about building momentum and keeping you on track to achieve your goals and creating your ideal professional experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's a quick video that will answer a few more questions about the program: </p>

<h3>I'll Guide Your Journey</h3>
<p><img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491167072/tcffpksbssaqpzkgbyux.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>I'm Karlyn Borysenko, and for the last five years I've run <a href=""http://www.zenworkplace.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Zen Workplace</a>. I'm an organizational psychologist and work with individuals and organizations around the world to help them create amazing work experiences by infusing humanity back into the process. </p>
<p>But the sad truth is that most organizations who need someone like me will never hire me because they don't want to admit they need someone like me! So anyone working in those organizations has one of two choices - they either keep it business as usual or they work with someone like me one-on-one for thousands of dollars. </p>
<p>That's why I'm creating Work Reboot - to give people the option to get the same advice and guidance as my one-on-one clients get in a group setting. That brings the price point down for everyone, and makes it available to a lot more people. </p>
<p>For me, this is personal. I've had horrible professional experiences. <a href=""https://hbr.org/2016/04/how-to-work-for-a-narcissistic-boss"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">I've worked for narcissists</a>. And when I finally found happiness, I kicked myself all the time for not dealing with the situation sooner. Work Reboot is the solution that I wish I had when I needed it. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Work Reboot is a program that I've been using for years with my one-on-one coaching clients that I want to bring to a broader audience at a more affordable price point. This campaign will support the infrastructure to make that happen. Supporting this campaign is also the only way to get to participate in the first session of Work Reboot, starting in June 2017. </p>
<p>The minimum I need to make this happen is $5,000, which amounts to about 20 participants in the program through this campaign - a very achievable number! The funding of this campaign is fixed - if I don't reach the $5,000 then the program doesn't run in June. </p>
<p>To get there, I've got some amazing perks lined up, including discounted access to Work Reboot, one-on-one coaching, and other online trainings that will help you be more successful at work. Here's the list: </p>

The cafe would feature feature fresh, nutritious and seasonal fare rooted in Mexican, Latinx and Mediterranean traditions, and tea blends crafted with herbs designed to heal and support overall well-being and health. Having this space will create the opportunity for us to host nutrition and cooking classes for both adults and children, host CSA share pick-ups and weekly wellness offerings for the community.

<h3>What is Literacy Lounge?</h3>
<p>Literacy Lounge was an idea that Harmony thought of while going through a flare up from her lupus in the Fall of 2017. She wanted to create a better reading experience for others to help them relax because reading has been an important part of her life.</p>
<p>By using black literature we want to highlight the many black authors that may have gone underrepresented, we believe that with this box, we can provide cultural diversity and representation for the African American community in the subscription box market. Our goal is to provide you with the topics to start healthy conversations.</p>
<p>After long nights of planning, working with others on our branding, videos, content, and products, we are finally on the verge of launching our new subscription box!</p>
<p>In today's society, we are always on the go whether we are checking emails, finishing up school, or taking care of our family. Within all of this we seem to forget to make time for ourselves. With Literacy Lounge we want to bring your serenity by giving you items that enhance your reading experience and/or help you relax. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What's in the Box?</strong></h2>
<p>Literacy Lounge will include one book and 2-4 items that go along with the book and/or stimulate relaxation.</p>
<p>After choosing a book and writing down our thoughts, we take the time to look at our takeaway and how we can highlight a specific theme(s) throughout the book. Then we start to take ideas and turn them into reality and how we can bring them to life. Items included will go along with the theme and/or stimulate relaxation. </p>
<p>For our Indiegogo campaign we have created an exclusive box that will give you a taste of what's in store. Below we have items that will be included in our Founder's Box.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison</li>
<li>3 bags of Mighty Leaf Tea</li>
<li>Branded Bookmark</li>
<li>Poem by Mahogany L. Browne</li>
<li>Branded Sticker</li>
<li>Self Love Card</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Where the Funds Will Go</h3>
<p>A lot of the hard work is done for our Founders Box and a few branded items like our shirts, but we need your help to take the next step. Your contributions will help us continue to build a better website, reduce costs of bulk orders, and marketing.</p>
<p>Please take the time to choose a perk that matches or exceeds what you would like to contribute. We want to thank you for not only believing  in us, but something that we believe in as well.</p>
<p>Below we have a chart that shows you exactly where these funds will go.</p>

<p>Harmony</p>
<p>Lawton, OK</p>
<p>Founder</p>
<p>Harmony was inspired to create something for her fellow peers through her love for reading. She is a recent graduate from the University of Central Oklahoma with a Fashion Marketing degree. Her favorite quote is ""We Read to Know We Are Not Alone."" - C.S. Lewis</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dorion</p>
<p>Oklahoma City, OK</p>
<p>Co-Founder</p>
<p>Dorion is a recent graduate from the University of Central Oklahoma with a Business Administration degree. He grew up as an athlete, but discovered his love for reading through business books like ""Startup Land"". His favorite quote is “Not all readers are leaders, but all leaders are readers.” - Henry Ford</p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our biggest challenge will be reaching our niche audience which are those that understand the importance of promoting and reading books written by Black authors and the significance of self care. Together, we can create a box that is not only valuable but also impactful to the community.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

Literacy Lounge was an idea that Harmony thought of while going through a flare up from her lupus in the Fall of 2017. She wanted to create a better reading experience for others to help them relax because reading has been an important part of her life.
By using black literature we want to highlight the many black authors that may have gone underrepresented, we believe that with this box, we can provide cultural diversity and representation for the African American community in the subscription box market. Our goal is to provide you with the topics to start healthy conversations.
After long nights of planning, working with others on our branding, videos, content, and products, we are finally on the verge of launching our new subscription box!
In today's society, we are always on the go whether we are checking emails, finishing up school, or taking care of our family. Within all of this we seem to forget to make time for ourselves. With Literacy Lounge we want to bring your serenity by giving you items that enhance your reading experience and/or help you relax. 
 
What's in the Box?
Literacy Lounge will include one book and 2-4 items that go along with the book and/or stimulate relaxation.
After choosing a book and writing down our thoughts, we take the time to look at our takeaway and how we can highlight a specific theme(s) throughout the book. Then we start to take ideas and turn them into reality and how we can bring them to life. Items included will go along with the theme and/or stimulate relaxation. 
For our Indiegogo campaign we have created an exclusive box that will give you a taste of what's in store. Below we have items that will be included in our Founder's Box.

The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison
3 bags of Mighty Leaf Tea
Branded Bookmark
Poem by Mahogany L. Browne
Branded Sticker
Self Love Card

 
Where the Funds Will Go
A lot of the hard work is done for our Founders Box and a few branded items like our shirts, but we need your help to take the next step. Your contributions will help us continue to build a better website, reduce costs of bulk orders, and marketing.
Please take the time to choose a perk that matches or exceeds what you would like to contribute. We want to thank you for not only believing  in us, but something that we believe in as well.
Below we have a chart that shows you exactly where these funds will go.
 

 
Meet the Team

Harmony
Lawton, OK
Founder
Harmony was inspired to create something for her fellow peers through her love for reading. She is a recent graduate from the University of Central Oklahoma with a Fashion Marketing degree. Her favorite quote is ""We Read to Know We Are Not Alone."" - C.S. Lewis
 
Dorion
Oklahoma City, OK
Co-Founder
Dorion is a recent graduate from the University of Central Oklahoma with a Business Administration degree. He grew up as an athlete, but discovered his love for reading through business books like ""Startup Land"". His favorite quote is “Not all readers are leaders, but all leaders are readers.” - Henry Ford
 
Risks & Challenges
Our biggest challenge will be reaching our niche audience which are those that understand the importance of promoting and reading books written by Black authors and the significance of self care. Together, we can create a box that is not only valuable but also impactful to the community.

<p>TreckHub seeks to create economic and social development locally in the area.</p>
<p>By itself our company will be able to develop the local economy of the zone by means of the manufacture and commercialization of footwear, since what it seeks is to create employment in the area that we will tackle, at the same time that we give added value to the inhabitants by mean of labor training seen as a form of education and promoting the certifications offered by CONOCER (National Council for Standardization and Certification of Competencies). This gives us three ways to reduce poverty, first is the direct employment provided by our factory, then there are the indirect jobs that arise around us trough our providers and finally the jobs and businesses that our workers can create using the training and knowledge that we have granted them, thus increasing their purchasing power. The initial training that will be given will be to develop the shoes of recycled materials through a craft process, on the other hand will also seek to certify those who engage in some skills and crafts works through the ECO217 (a certification provided by the governmental entity Secretary Of Public Education) in order that they can also train more people.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Because the government has not implemented programs that seek to solve the problems of employment development of the local economy that are effective, TrekHub seeks to collaborate with the same and diverse empathic companies with the cause to generate a positive response capable of generating a significant change.

It is important to identify that 94% of footwear production is located in the central-north region of the country, which increases the costs of moving the product to its Commercialization in the south of the country.

</div></div>","Our Story
We are AVM Survivors, Fighters, and members of Ben's Friends Patient Support Communities.
 
And we are awesome!  Just ask any of the 7500 members of our 24 support groups.  Each and every one of them is affected by a rare disease and actively sharing stories, supporting each other, and raising awareness.
 
AVMSurvivors.org is our support group for those affected by AVM (Arteriovenous Malformation) a deficiency in the cardiovascular system characterized by abnormalities between the arteries and veins. Malformations can occur in different parts of the body, and can cause fatal strokes when the tangled blood ruptures.  With Nearly 3000 members across the globe, AVM Survivors is our first and largest community and was created as a result of Ben's brain hemorrhage in 2006 and his desire to connect with others who shared his experience.

As this year's Team Captain, Shalon is excited to use the walk as an opportunity to hang out with her AVM family.  While she typically only knows them online, the connection and feelings of kinship shared by each member couldn't be more real if she saw them daily.  AVMSurvivors.org is the kind of group that is brought together by tragedy, uncertainty, and hardship, but stays together because of the awesome people, kind hearts, and generous spirit of our members.

This is officially the third year AVMSurvivors.org has participated in the TAAF Aneurysm & AVM walk in beautiful San Francisco.  We KNOW how important it is to raise awareness and support TAAF(The Aneurysm & AVM Foundation.)  We KNOW how scary it is when people find out that they, or a loved one, has suffered a bleed or stroke.  And we KNOW just how lucky they feel to connect with others who understand what they are facing.  After all, we ARE survivors and fighters!

This Awareness walk is growing each year and is allowing all of us to make an impact, to share knowledge, and to help people.  What is better than that???  Nothing!  So help us help others.  Consider this your good deed for the day.  And actually, go ahead and consider this your good deed for the year too!  (Of course that does require a bigger donation.)



What We Need & What You Get
This year's fundraising event is twofold and will be split 80/20.
First and most importantly we are raising money for TAAF in their mission of being, ""Dedicated to bettering the lives, support networks, and medical care of those affected by aneurysm and other types of vascular malformation of the brain.""  TAAF is strictly a pro-bono organization with virtually no administrative costs. The goal is to direct money where it is needed — into research and public education. You can see the many ways you can help by going to the TAAF website and viewing the Get Involved or Donation sections of their website.

Secondly we are raising money to support Ben's Friends Patient Communities.  A smaller portion (20%) of this fundraiser will help to pay for the AVM Survivors site, which is free of charge to all members.  BensFriends.org is a mission-driven company dedicated to providing safe and supportive patient communities for anyone affected by a rare disease.  Your donation will help us continue to build communities and provide much needed and free support to thousands of people affected by rare diseases.

What do you get???

Other than the warm and fuzzy feeling you get by doing something good for another person, we actually have ""stuff!""  Fun and Pretty things (Special AVM edition Brainbows, Lion Snaps, and Butterfly Charms,) AVM Walk T-shirts (I'll message you for size info), Hugs...yes, I said hugs, awesome Art Work, and even dinner with our fearless leader Ben!  And just to help entice you, here is a sneak peek of a few of our items!  Our newest T-shirt design is great.  And how cute our all of our little Fun or Pretty items?  Seriously, how can you resist?
 
 Check out our tiers to the right and decide just how much you love us and want us to love you back!  Well, we love you anyways no matter how much you decide to donate.  Heck, we will love you just for checking out our page cause that's how we are.
 


Other Ways You Can Help

Share the love!  No really, PLEASE SHARE.  Email your friends and family, and post a link to our fundraising site www.indiegogo.com/avmsurvivors on your facebook page.  And of course, don't forget to ""like"" all of us too!  (TAAF, Ben's Friends, and AVM Survivors all have their very own facebook pages.)

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>We are 4 students at The University of Tennessee who are raising money for <a href=""https://pawsandbadges.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Paws and Badges</a>, a local 501(c)3 non-profit organization located in Knoxville, Tennessee. Paws and Badges is an organization that matches trained dogs, who were rescued from local shelters, with people that have PTSD, primarily First Responders and Veterans. We chose this organization because PTSD is a devastating disorder, with little attention brought to it. This organization has shown us that the power of companionship can completely turn around lives.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521510805/clzph1h5zav3t6va1gaz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Paws and Badges was founded in 2015 by B&amp;B K-9 Obedience. Mike Bartleson was a retired Knox County Sheriff who had 7 years of canine handling and training experience, which is how B&amp;B K-9 came into existence.  With the help of a small group in the community, Paws and Badges was born. The program aims to help as many as 25 clients per year, treating their PTSD conditions.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>The cost of training service dogs is around $20,000 and takes up to 9 months to train the dogs to be certified as active service dogs.  This means that Paws &amp; Badges must provide the necessary tools, shelter, and food for 9 months before the dogs are adopted. Our group’s goal is to raise $1,000 to help provide food for the dogs while they are getting trained.  </p>

<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Setting up a reward/perk system will be our way of giving back to those who donate to our campaign. The first perk will be a $10 social media shoutout from our Facebook.  The second perk will be set at $25 and it will be a chew toy to be shipped out. The third perk will be a $50 Custom T-shirt, and finally the last perk is $100 and it will be a personalized video shoutout along with a T-shirt</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How it Helps</h3>
<p>By setting up this campaign, we will be able to help Paws &amp; Badges through the donations on our Indiegogo page. Sharing this campaign will help bring in more donations. These donations will help to pay for food for the dogs giving them the energy to help these suffering veterans. Your donations aren’t just paying for operating costs, they are changing lives. The impact these dogs have on those suffering with PTSD is indescribable.</p>
<p>Service dogs are trained to detect sudden changes in their owners’ behavior and physical changes their owners’ go through while having a flashback or heightened anxiety.  This means that when a veteran who has PTSD goes into a flashback, the dog can sense this and will bring his owner his medication or some water to help. These donations go to helping make those with PTSD more comfortable and allow for these dogs to complete their training and to help do their part for our veterans.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Other ways to help instead of money could be something as simple as a social media shout-out for Paws &amp; Badges <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pawsandbadges/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a>. By shouting out their social media page on your own personal account, it brings publicity to the organization from people who may have never heard of them before. Another way to help Paws and Badges without donating money would be to donate your time and effort to help handle the dogs as well work on projects.</p>

Algunas de las cabañas, como la piloto, tendrán también un entrañable porche donde disfrutar de las puestas de sol. Hemos querido compartir y crear comunidad en el proyecto de VIVEKA porque nos parece una oportunidad única, ya que se trata de algo excepcional y diferente en el país. Desde que ideamos VIVEKA hasta la campaña de Indiegogo hemos valorado muchas propuestas profesionales, materiales y presupuestos, y finalmente nos hemos decantado por las opciones de calidad que impliquen un mayor respeto al entorno y un mayor confort dentro de la casita.Los 10.000 € de esta campaña sirven para finalizar la cabaña piloto y dar unas condiciones al terreno que destinamos a Viveka para que pueda haber más casitas. Si superamos el objetivo que nos hemos propuesto, empezaremos la construcción de otra cabaña. Aquí te explicamos la evolución del proyecto desde sus inicios y cómo tenemos previsto que avance:**Consultar condiciones de las recompensas. Hay uno de los factores clave para que Viveka sea un proyecto tan increíble: el paisaje. Tavertet es uno de los lugares más bonitos de Cataluña, y es que sus espectaculares acantilados con vistas al Pantano de Sau, la magia de la niebla acompañando la salida de sol, y una vista de 360 º de toda Cataluña (desde los Pirineos, el Pedraforca o el Montseny), no dejan indiferente a nadie.  Uno de los retos de Viveka es cómo llevar el agua y la luz a las cabañas, precisamente por lo aisladas que están. La primera opción es llevar el agua y la luz desde la casa principal, pero si eso no fuera posible, lo resolveríamos haciendo que cada casita tuviera su propio sistema de abastecimiento a través de placas solares y un tanque de agua que podríamos ir llenando cada vez que se necesitara.Si bien el aislamiento es de calidad, podríamos encontrarnos que para un invierno duro (como el del 2018), el material empleado no fuera totalmente suficiente. También tenemos pensada una alternativa: instalaríamos una estufa de pellets y reforzaríamos el aislamiento de la cabaña con otros materiales. Detrás del proyecto de VIVEKA está Casa Virupa, una comunidad budista integrada por personas con diferentes intereses y formaciones pero con una misma inquietud:  la apuesta por una forma de vida encaminada a la felicidad de todos los seres. Casa Virupa es un proyecto fresco, dinámico y joven, por eso también abrimos nuestras puertas para que cualquiera que busque tranquilidad y conocer su mente pueda hacerlo aquí, y por eso vamos programando cursos, retiros, enseñanzas, talleres... en relación a la meditación y a la filosofía budista.Ahora bien, en el proceso de elaboración de VIVEKA nos han ayudado muchísimas personas que no viven con nosotros en Casa Virupa pero que forman parte de nuestra red, son nuestra familia escogida y también la de sangre. A todos ellos debemos un proyecto tan ambicioso como es Viveka y les agradecemos desde lo más profundo de nuestro corazón su implicación desinteresada, valiente y generosa con VIVEKA y, por extensión, con Casa Virupa.Conócenos más aquí:www.casavirupa.comwww.facebook.com/casavirupawww.instagram.com/casavirupaEscucha esta entrevista (en catalán) al director de la comunidad de Casa Virupa, Román Sánchez Orpella. ****************************************************************** VIVEKA is a project born out of Casa Virupa, a Buddhist center and community in Tavertet. Our wish is for everyone who comes here to be able to take advantage of the calmness and isolation of the cabin for their spiritual practice (retreats), for a creative or research project, or to simply enjoy nature and silence. VIVEKA is a project of little wooden cabins for going on retreats or for spending some peaceful days in Tavertet, Catalonia.While VIVEKA is mainly conceived for meditation practitioners to have a place to go on strict retreats, we also believe it is ideal for anyone who wants to take refuge and live in a serene and fully natural environment, far from the hustle and bustle of the city.VIVEKA is a pali word that means “reclusion”, “isolation” or “retreat”. Buddha considered retreats to be fundamental for spiritual growth, to observe oneself and appreciate solitude, to cultivate attention and gentleness. We would like these cabins to offer a feeling of total isolation and comfort, which is why the cabins we’ll be constructing will be sufficiently removed from the paths that surround Casa Virupa while, at the same time, be close enough to access them from the vicinity of main house without any difficulty.Another of the objectives is for the little houses to be well integrated with the environment and for them to be as discreet as possible, so as not to break the harmony of the landscape. For this reason we wanted to prioritize organic and ecological materials:Regarding the interior of the cabins, we want them to look sober since we believe there is much richness in simplicity, nevertheless, they will offer a minimum level of comfort that ensures the cabin is a warm home for the those on the retreat.The cabins will be between 15 and 20m2 and will include a room with a bed, a space for one’s practice, a little kitchen and a table for meals, as well as a simple bathroom and a shower. Some cabins, like the pilot one, will also have an endearing porch to enjoy the sunset.We have wanted to share and enlarge our community in the VIVEKA project since we consider it a unique opportunity, something very exceptional and different in the country.From the moment we first conceived VIVEKA until the Indiegogo campaign we have valued proposals by many professionals regarding materials and budgets, and we have finally chosen the quality options that will allow for a greater care of the environment and a greater comfort inside the cabins.The 10.000€ from this campaign will be used to finalize the pilot cabin and give the land we have chosen for Viveka the right conditions for constructing more cabins. If we surpass the goal we have set for ourselves, we will begin the construction of another cabin.At the end of 2018 we started to elaborate a project of retreat cabins, and we consulted different professionals who advised us on which were the fundamental elements for constructing beautiful, modest and comfortable houses to live in.Here we show you the evolution of the project from its inception and how we envision its development:There is a key factor that makes VIVEKA such an incredible project: the landscape. Tavertet is one of the most beautiful places in Catalonia, with spectacular views of the Sau Reservoir, magical sunrises through the fog, and a 360º view Catalonia (including the Pyrenees, the Pedraforca and the Montseny mountains), all of which have never left anybody indifferent.One of the risks of VIVEKA is equipping the cabins with water and electricity due precisely to their isolation. Our first option will be to bring water and electricity from the main house, but if that was not possible, we would solve it by providing each little house with its own supply system through solar panels and a water tank that we could keep filling whenever necessary.Although the cabins will be well insulated, it could be that on a very harsh winter (such as the 2018 one) the materials we have used were not strong enough. The alternative in this case would be to install a pellets heater and reinforce the insulation of the cabin with other materials. Behind VIVEKA there is CASA VIRUPA, which is a community made up of people with diverse interests and educational backgrounds sharing a common motivation: finding a way of life that is oriented towards the happiness of all sentient beings.Casa Virupa is a fresh, dynamic and young project, so we open our doors for anyone searching for tranquility and better understanding of their mind to come do it here. This is why we are programming courses, retreats, teachings and workshops in relation to meditation and Buddhist philosophy.That being said, many people who don’t live with us in Casa Virupa but belong to our network have helped us in the process of developing VIVEKA, people who are our chosen family as well as blood relatives. We owe all of them for such an ambitious project as Viveka and we thank them from the bottom of our heart for their disinterested, brave and generous implication in VIVEKA and, by extension, Casa Virupa.Get to know us better here:www.casavirupa.comwww.facebook.com/casavirupawww.instagram.com/casavirupaListen to this interview (in Catalan) with the director of the community of Casa Virupa, Román Sánchez Orpella.  ******************************************************************Ilustraciones / Illustrations: Fabio Castro (https://www.instagram.com/fabiocastro27/).",50.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Every woman over 40 has a story....</h3>
<p>It might be about her mother, her grandmother, or even herself.</p>
<p>When we were younger, we didn't have answers to the confusing questions that arose for us when our moms made us leave the pool or the mall ""right this minute"" because, as it turns out, she was having a menopause-induced hot flash/ hormonal emotional surge.

<p><strong>But despite these advances, we are still left with a void when it comes to easy access to a full range of clear, researched information. </strong></p>
<p>Seeing your doctor is time-consuming and usually expensive. And sorting through information on the internet can be overwhelming and confusing.</p>

someone ask me, ""How do you teach someone how to ride a horse?""  I thought about it for a while, then said,
""You don't.  You teach them how to
have a relationship with a horse."" This Project is about horses connecting
to youth who are in trouble, and about the healing which can occur.  We want to expand on our initial work, build
on our initial success, and further develop our own unique form of culturally
based equine therapy/therapeutic horsemanship, blending our own traditions with
mainstream ideas to network with existing funding streams to build a
sustainable project. We need your support to do this. </p>
<p><b>Our home.</b> Native Americans represent less than one percent of this
country's population and yet when you take a look at everything negative mainstream
society keeps track of, we're leading the statistics.  What most don't know is that Standing Rock is
a beautiful place to live.  It's here
among our own people that our children have their greatest struggles and their
greatest strengths.  We are actively
working to retain our language and spiritual heritage, and we are working on
bringing horses back into the lives of the people.  We strongly believe that if we can
reintroduce horses back into the lives of our people, then our children, grand
children and those not yet born will once again flourish.</p>
<p>Home of the Hunkpapa
Lakota, the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation encompasses two counties, Sioux
County in North Dakota and Corson County in South Dakota.  Both counties made the list of the ten poorest
counties in the Nation with over 40% of residents living in poverty.  A recent study conducted by a university in
Wisconsin identified Standing Rock as one of the least healthy places in the
United States.  Studies show that Native
American communities are 100 percent affected by alcohol and drugs, one third
of Native American women have experienced some form of sexual assault or
violence in their lifetime, Native American communities are seeing epidemic rates
of diabetes, heart disease and cancer.  </p>
<p><b>Our youth.</b> Everybody wants to feel connected in this world.  We all have a unique human need to feel a
part of something.  Today, I don't think
that our youth feel that.  I don't think
they feel connected to their people through their language or their spirituality.  I don't think they feel connected to
mainstream society or the rest of the world for that matter.  What we're trying to do is to help them to
center themselves again. </p>
<p>A report by Stephanie
Woodard for NBC News recently said, ""A youth-suicide epidemic is sweeping
Indian country, with Native American teens and young adults killing themselves
at more than triple the rate of other American youth, according to federal
government figures.""  In 1997,
Standing Rock went through a suicide crisis and in 2000 we went through another.  I have personally lost a younger brother and
a younger cousin to suicide.  What I
learned from this experiences is this, we can't wait for the United States
government or State Governments to give us much needed resources to rebuild our
communities, we can't even wait for own Tribal governments or a program.  As a people, we have everything we need to
create change.  We know that we can do
better. We can surround them with support and love.  We can create a system of care that
acknowledges and gives merit to the cultural and spiritual teachings of my
people.  I strongly believe we can make a
difference with your help.  </p>
<p><b>Our horses.</b> The Lakota people have a point of origin story of the
horse and the gift they brought to our ancestors.  Our ancestors knew and understood the horse,
referring to them as a sacred relative.  Sunkawakan
Oyate ki, The Horse Nation.  The word for
horse in Lakota is sunkawakan.  Sunka
means, beautiful, pure and innocent. 
Wakan is the ability to create life and destroy life, both good and
bad.  When you put them together, you get
a glimpse at the spiritual understandings our ancestors had of our sacred
relative, sunkawakan. </p>
<p>On July 19th, 1881
Sitting Bull and the Hunkpapa turned themselves in at Fort Buford.  It was a hard time for the Hunkpapa when they
gave up their weapons and their horses. 
It is said that Sitting Bull said to his son, Crowfoot, ""My boy, if
you live, you will never be a man in this world, because you can never have a
gun or pony."" We often talk about the affects the Indian Wars, forced
assimilation, U.S. federal Indian policy and boarding schools have had on our
people, but what we seem to have forgotten was how traumatic the loss of horses
was to our ancestors.  </p>
<p><b>What happens when youth and horses come together.</b> Becoming one with the spirit of the
horse is not a horsemanship model, it's a way of life.  I am certified to provide Equine Assisted
Learning (EAL) and Equine Assisted Psychotherapy (EAP) by both the Equine
Assisted Growth And Learning Association (EAGALA) and Greg Kersten's, OK Corral
Series.  It was Greg who encouraged me to
develop my own approach to equine therapy by saying, ""Don't let anyone
tell you how to do this.  Your people
have always been gifted with horses."" 
And you know what?  He was
right.  Our people have always known that
horses can affect you in powerful ways.  </p>
<p>One day, while working
with a group of middle school students on a different reservation, I had turned
three horses loose in an arena.  I told
the students, ""If those horses represented Tunkasila, I want you to go and
develop a relationship with the Creator."" 
I watched as a  young lady
approached a horse that earlier had acted standoffish.  She approached the horse tentatively at
first, and when her confidence faltered, the horse took a step towards
her.  The young lady took a step closer
and the horse lowered its head and pulled the young lady in close.  They both just stood there holding each other.  When the activity was over, I invited the
students to circle up in the center of the arena.  One by one, I asked each of them about their
experience, when it was the young ladies turn, I asked, ""I noticed when
you approached that horse, the horse reached for you and pulled you close.  What do you think was happening at that moment?""  The young lady was silent for a while then
answered, ""The horse knew what I was going through.""  I later learned that the young lady had just
lost her mother.  This is just one
example of the powerful healing moments I'm blessed to be a part of.  This is why I believe so much in what I do.
Becoming one with the Spirit of the Horse is a unique experience that uses the
spirit of the horse to create a path to healing.</p>
<p><b>Our Races</b>.  We come from a
horse culture.  In 2006, a friend of mine
hosted war pony races at his ranch in Kenel, SD and invited me to be a sponsor.  As I sat there that day, I realized something
was happening on a spiritual level, the horses were doctoring people because of
their healing abilities.  I went home and
talked to my wife about what I seen and we decided to sponsor our own races.  As family and friends heard of our intentions,
many came forward in support and pledged races. 
In 2007, we hosted our first Sungkiyangkob Pi (Horse Races) in the Long
Soldier community and this year will mark our 7th year honoring our ancestors
and the horse nation.  </p>
<p>In 2011, our tiospaye (Lakota
Traditional Kinship System) sponsored an oskate (Traditional Celebration) to
honor our ancestors victory at the Battle of the Greasy Grass, also known as
the Battle of the Little Bighorn.  It
quickly grew and has become a favorite event for competitors and spectators alike.  The celebration consists of a traditional
social dances, horse races, victory dance and a feed.  It is an immersion event where the Lakota
language is spoken and our oral histories are told.  This will be our third year hosting this
oskate and we have received tremendous support from the people.  Several families have pledged dance specials
and horse races.  Many different bands of
the Oceti Sakonwin (Seven Councils Fires) of our nation come to compete in
friendly, but fierce tribal competition on horseback.  </p>
<p>We aren't doing this
for ourselves, we're doing this for our people. 
Unfortunately, many live outside of our way of life and are suffering.  We do this to help them to center themselves
and reconnect with who they really are, everyone has a place in our tiospaye.  It is our belief that we are still connected
to our ancestors, we have a genetic memory. 
At one time in our history, our ancestors were considered to have been
one of the greatest light cavalries in the world, their horsemanship was
legendary.  A warrior and his horse were
a powerful weapon, but today they've come back into our lives as healers.</p>

<p></p>
<p></p><p><b><span>Our Next Steps: What we need from you. </span></b><span>We would like to blend our own culturally based equine
therapy/therapeutic horsemanship with our years of experience with the
wraparound process and systems of care development, to create something unique,
something that is driven by the people, a project that is strength based and
needs driven and will provide unconditional care.  We need your support to make this dream come
true.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The National Wraparound Initiative defines
wraparound as, ""...an intensive, holistic method of engaging with
individuals with complex needs (most typically children, youth, and their
families) so that they can live in their homes and communities and realize
their hopes and dreams.""</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>We believe we have the experience to make
this happen.  In 1998, I was hired by the
Sacred Child Project, a demonstration project funded by the Substance Abuse
Mental Health Service Administration (SAMHSA) and the Center for Mental Health
Services (CMHS), as a care coordinator, where I implemented the wraparound
process with Native American families.  The
very first training I went to was with Dr. John VanDenBerg.  I spent two days listening to him talk about
the wraparound process, and what impressed me the most was that it sounded like
he was talking about our Lakota way of life. 
The last thing he said at the end of our two days together was, ""I
feel blessed to be a part of this process.""  At that point in my career, I really needed
to know what that felt like.  Over the
years, John has become a good friend and mentor of mine.  He is well known for his contributions to the
wraparound process and systems of care communities and is a volunteer
consultant to this project.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>I have twenty four years of experience in
human services, working with children, families and communities and am
considered an expert on Systems of Care, the Wraparound Process, Family
Engagement and Equine Therapy.  Today, I
am self employed and have sixteen years of experience consulting with tribes,
states and national organizations.  I've
presented at tribal, state and national conferences across the United States
and Canada, but now want to focus my attention on my own homelands. 
</span><span>We've gone through seven generations
of decline, it just might take us seven generations to come back out of this
again.  We have to have the foresight that
what we're doing today is going to have such a long reaching impact, that we're
going to touch seven generations into the future.  That's how strong we have to be in our faith
today.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><span>Accountability: How we will spend
your money and why.</span></b></p>
<p><span>We already have the land, we have the horses, we have the youth, but we
need the physical tools.  Specifically, during
the first year while we build a permanent funding base, we will spend your
money on the following: </span></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span><b><span>Arena.</span></b> The
Standing Rock Sioux Reservation has eight tribal communities spread out over
2.3 million acres of land and travel can be a barrier to services and
supports.  We need a portable arena made
of 10’ welded corral panels that will allow us to be mobile so we can travel to
the eight communities.  Instead of
asking youth to come to us, we want to be the ability to go to them.  Safety is important and the arena will need
to be about 100’ by 80’.  36 panels X
$120/panel = $4320</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span><b><span>Tipi.</span></b> We are
in need of seven lodges which we will use as part of the cultural lessons to
the youth.  Each part of the teepee has
special significance, as we assemble the lodges, we teach the story of woope,
our seven spiritual laws and star knowledge.  It has become a powerful team building
exercise.  We also talk about the roles
of men and women and the sacred gift of life. 
The seven lodges also represent the Oceti Sakonwin, or seven council
fires of our nation.  One 16' lodge with
poles, cover, door and liner costs would cost $1,500 x 7 = $10,500</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span><b><span>PA System.  </span></b>We are in need of a good quality PA
system that would be used to provide sound at our community equine events,
i.e.,  horse races, Battle of the Greasy
Grass Celebration, Equine Assisted Learning events.  PA System = $2,500</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span><b><span>Gasoline and vehicle costs.</span></b>  When we take the
program to other places, we need to buy gasoline and oil for the trucks and
trailers, and sometimes repair our old trucks. We need $3000  for transportation costs. </p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span><b><span>Advertising</span></b>.
We have to get the word out about the program. We will use word of mouth, but
also will buy advertising on tribal radio and press.  We need $3,000 for advertising and developing
short film clips for use in publicity. </p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span><b><span>Consultants.  </span></b>We would like to be able to pay
consultants to assist us in creating Lakota language immersion events.  The money donated would be used to pay
consultant fees, travel and lodging for Lakota speakers, two announcers for the
oskate and singers.  </p>
<p><span>Consultants = $5,000</span></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span><b><span>Food.  </span></b>The Lakota have a strong belief that
food is medicine that can heal and strengthen our bodies and our spirit.  We are asking for assistance in making sure
that we have the ability to provide nutritional meals are our gatherings.  Food = $1,680</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span><b><span>Total Costs for the Year</span></b>. We estimate the equipment and related costs for the
first year at $30,000 </p>
<p></p>
<p><b><span>Perks.</span></b> 
The words of a traditional wopila olowan (Song of giving thanks), that
is sung to honor families during giveaways reminds me of why providing perks is
so important to this project.  ""<i>Tuwe sece kun, taku ota luha kin, oyate kin
wi canku, toksa ake luha ki.</i>""  Translation
- Whoever gives alot to the people, later will receive. </p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The Lakota people have a long cultural tradition of honoring through
gifts and it's important to us that we include this value in this project.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p><br/></div>","The Project:  I once had
someone ask me, ""How do you teach someone how to ride a horse?""  I thought about it for a while, then said,
""You don't.  You teach them how to
have a relationship with a horse."" This Project is about horses connecting
to youth who are in trouble, and about the healing which can occur.  We want to expand on our initial work, build
on our initial success, and further develop our own unique form of culturally
based equine therapy/therapeutic horsemanship, blending our own traditions with
mainstream ideas to network with existing funding streams to build a
sustainable project. We need your support to do this. 
Our home. Native Americans represent less than one percent of this
country's population and yet when you take a look at everything negative mainstream
society keeps track of, we're leading the statistics.  What most don't know is that Standing Rock is
a beautiful place to live.  It's here
among our own people that our children have their greatest struggles and their
greatest strengths.  We are actively
working to retain our language and spiritual heritage, and we are working on
bringing horses back into the lives of the people.  We strongly believe that if we can
reintroduce horses back into the lives of our people, then our children, grand
children and those not yet born will once again flourish.
Home of the Hunkpapa
Lakota, the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation encompasses two counties, Sioux
County in North Dakota and Corson County in South Dakota.  Both counties made the list of the ten poorest
counties in the Nation with over 40% of residents living in poverty.  A recent study conducted by a university in
Wisconsin identified Standing Rock as one of the least healthy places in the
United States.  Studies show that Native
American communities are 100 percent affected by alcohol and drugs, one third
of Native American women have experienced some form of sexual assault or
violence in their lifetime, Native American communities are seeing epidemic rates
of diabetes, heart disease and cancer.  
Our youth. Everybody wants to feel connected in this world.  We all have a unique human need to feel a
part of something.  Today, I don't think
that our youth feel that.  I don't think
they feel connected to their people through their language or their spirituality.  I don't think they feel connected to
mainstream society or the rest of the world for that matter.  What we're trying to do is to help them to
center themselves again. 
A report by Stephanie
Woodard for NBC News recently said, ""A youth-suicide epidemic is sweeping
Indian country, with Native American teens and young adults killing themselves
at more than triple the rate of other American youth, according to federal
government figures.""  In 1997,
Standing Rock went through a suicide crisis and in 2000 we went through another.  I have personally lost a younger brother and
a younger cousin to suicide.  What I
learned from this experiences is this, we can't wait for the United States
government or State Governments to give us much needed resources to rebuild our
communities, we can't even wait for own Tribal governments or a program.  As a people, we have everything we need to
create change.  We know that we can do
better. We can surround them with support and love.  We can create a system of care that
acknowledges and gives merit to the cultural and spiritual teachings of my
people.  I strongly believe we can make a
difference with your help.  
Our horses. The Lakota people have a point of origin story of the
horse and the gift they brought to our ancestors.  Our ancestors knew and understood the horse,
referring to them as a sacred relative.  Sunkawakan
Oyate ki, The Horse Nation.  The word for
horse in Lakota is sunkawakan.  Sunka
means, beautiful, pure and innocent. 
Wakan is the ability to create life and destroy life, both good and
bad.  When you put them together, you get
a glimpse at the spiritual understandings our ancestors had of our sacred
relative, sunkawakan. 
On July 19th, 1881
Sitting Bull and the Hunkpapa turned themselves in at Fort Buford.  It was a hard time for the Hunkpapa when they
gave up their weapons and their horses. 
It is said that Sitting Bull said to his son, Crowfoot, ""My boy, if
you live, you will never be a man in this world, because you can never have a
gun or pony."" We often talk about the affects the Indian Wars, forced
assimilation, U.S. federal Indian policy and boarding schools have had on our
people, but what we seem to have forgotten was how traumatic the loss of horses
was to our ancestors.  
What happens when youth and horses come together. Becoming one with the spirit of the
horse is not a horsemanship model, it's a way of life.  I am certified to provide Equine Assisted
Learning (EAL) and Equine Assisted Psychotherapy (EAP) by both the Equine
Assisted Growth And Learning Association (EAGALA) and Greg Kersten's, OK Corral
Series.  It was Greg who encouraged me to
develop my own approach to equine therapy by saying, ""Don't let anyone
tell you how to do this.  Your people
have always been gifted with horses."" 
And you know what?  He was
right.  Our people have always known that
horses can affect you in powerful ways.  
One day, while working
with a group of middle school students on a different reservation, I had turned
three horses loose in an arena.  I told
the students, ""If those horses represented Tunkasila, I want you to go and
develop a relationship with the Creator."" 
I watched as a  young lady
approached a horse that earlier had acted standoffish.  She approached the horse tentatively at
first, and when her confidence faltered, the horse took a step towards
her.  The young lady took a step closer
and the horse lowered its head and pulled the young lady in close.  They both just stood there holding each other.  When the activity was over, I invited the
students to circle up in the center of the arena.  One by one, I asked each of them about their
experience, when it was the young ladies turn, I asked, ""I noticed when
you approached that horse, the horse reached for you and pulled you close.  What do you think was happening at that moment?""  The young lady was silent for a while then
answered, ""The horse knew what I was going through.""  I later learned that the young lady had just
lost her mother.  This is just one
example of the powerful healing moments I'm blessed to be a part of.  This is why I believe so much in what I do.
Becoming one with the Spirit of the Horse is a unique experience that uses the
spirit of the horse to create a path to healing.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What is #DoMore104?</strong></h3>
<p>To celebrate the release of our new show <strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQCYhtlvmZc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Room 104</a></strong>, we’ve teamed up with the <strong><a href=""https://www.woundedwarriorproject.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Wounded Warrior Project</a></strong> and <strong><a href=""http://www.decartists.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">DEC Artists</a></strong> to do more good. </p>
<p>The idea comes from our belief that there is always room to do more good things for others. How can we help? How can we do more? So we’re raising money to support the men and women of our armed forces and thank them for all they've done. </p>
<p>Let’s do more together.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>How does it work?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>First</strong>, we're donating 100% of all donations made between July 12, 2017 and August 2, 2017 through the ""Back It"" button on this website directly to Wounded Warrior Project. </p>

What is #DoMore104?
To celebrate the release of our new show Room 104, we’ve teamed up with the Wounded Warrior Project and DEC Artists to do more good. 
The idea comes from our belief that there is always room to do more good things for others. How can we help? How can we do more? So we’re raising money to support the men and women of our armed forces and thank them for all they've done. 
Let’s do more together.
How does it work?
First, we're donating 100% of all donations made between July 12, 2017 and August 2, 2017 through the ""Back It"" button on this website directly to Wounded Warrior Project. 
Second, we've created a limited edition hand-pulled silkscreen poster from LA artist Teachr, and are selling prints, artists proofs, and other items in the Room 104 Store. We’re donating 50%* of the purchase price of every item sold in the Room 104 Store between July 12, 2017 and August 2, 2017 to the Wounded Warrior Project, and will match the total donation up to $5,000. And we ship worldwide too!
Third, for each time someone uses the hashtag #DoMore104 between July 12, 2017 and August 2, 2017, we’ll donate 10¢ to Wounded Warrior Project, up to another $5,000.

The time for herbal medicine is now. Do you have a vision to revolutionise healthcare? Are you working to connect people with plants in your community?

I know there are people out there who have yet to become aware of what herbal medicine can do to support their health. Here is one of my stories to how I was introduced to herbal medicine:I suffered excruciating time of the month where I’d faint or be out for two days every month which means my work, relationships, and goals were always affected. I was given a pill to pop daily but my symptoms never resided. I needed to find another answer.Along came my studies into the world of Health Science. Where I was able to start to understand my body and learn about the medicinal benefits of food and medicinal herbal medicine. From the specific constitutions to how they have worked for 1000s of years with specific actions. I’d finally found the answers I was looking for. Through my experience I am now on a mission to help woman who are suffering symptoms were they are getting a band aid approach.I’m currently studying a Bachelor of Health Science where I am attaining my degree in Naturopathy. I am creating a company with a line of products that can add to your quality of life. I will be doing this through opening a supplementary store which will provide the option of herbal remedies to health symptoms. While adhering to one of the naturopathic principles Docere, where I will be sharing knowledge to further empower our customers towards feeling good.I’ll be starting off with two products Fem-Aid and Women’s Energy Balance. With product expansion to even more specific health concerns of anxiety, sleep, brain, immune, plus so many more. ​To provide the best informational products in the health & wellness industry that improve the quality of life of our customers.

I have traditionally used acupuncture to address migraines that arise prior to the period. As a result of the recent world events, I could not partake in acupuncture. I decided to try this formula to address PMS issues. It is truly a miracle product – I have had not one migraine prior to my period or cramps during the period. It works for me and hope it works for you!"" - Amy“Okay I’m shook. I went off birth control back in October after being on it for 10 years from being diagnosed with PCOS at the age of 16. From then on, my cycle was between 45-47 days with awful PMS symptoms (bloating, irritability, CRAMPS, etc.). I also think I was so used to the fake pill period that a real period was hell. So - I bought 3 bottles of Fem-Aid because Suzzi recommends using for 3 months. I have only finished one bottle and my cycle went down to 36 days and I had the best period of my life. Manageable cramps, almost no bloating, etc. I am so thankful - thank you!!” - Georjenna“Im so grateful for this product. I have been told by so many doctors that the only answer to my periods was birth control. I finally decided to take my health into my own hands. Along with adjusting my diet (following woman code protocol) I have been using Fem-Aid to increase my reproductive health and balance my hormones. My periods are insanely better and more regular. Everything Suzzi touches turns to gold. You cannot go wrong with these products especially paired with habits and practices that support their use.” - Simone“I absolutely LOVEEEE this product. This was my first herbal product purchase & I’m so happy with the results. I am a new mom of two, I was constantly overwhelmed with a lot on my plate and no energy in the tank. Now I manage everything so much better. So thankful for this <3” - Joy“I’ve been taking this twice a day for 5 months to relieve physical energy struggles like fatigue and brain fog that were keeping me wanting to sleep all day long. I’d gone through some trauma at work that left me struggling to get out of bed. My doctor said nothing was wrong with me but I knew something wasn’t right. When i found woman energy balance I felt like I had finally received the support I was looking for. Now I wake up before the sun, got promoted to work I love and feel like I can do so much more. So so so thankful for this formula.” - MichelleDISCLAIMER:These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

<h3>Who We Are </h3>
<p>We are five students from the University of Tennessee working directly with the nonprofit organization Project Healing Waters to raise money for <a href=""http://www.projecthealingwaters.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Project Healing Waters</a> in order to aid in the rehabilitation of veterans with disabilities.</p>
<p>Project Healing Waters is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization that seeks to assist veterans with disabilities during their time of rehabilitation by educating them on how to fly-fish in the backcountry of the Smoky Mountains. The organization was founded in 2005 with the aid of wounded military personnel returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Not only does the organization provide rudimentary fly-fishing lessons, it also incorporates fly-tying and rod-building classes. These classes meet the experience levels of both novice and experienced participants and are completely free of cost to the veterans. It is Project Healing Waters’ dedication to providing long-term, ongoing classes that identify as opportunities for socialization and education that makes it unique and beneficial to its members. </p>

<h3>How It Will Impact the Community </h3>
<p>The impact the fundraising will have on the public starts with building a strong network among the community and local veterans. These experiences allow for the veterans and the public to build relationships between one another and impact the community in a positive way. When the veterans venture into the Great Smoky Mountains, they are able to share their stories and hopefully find a connection along the way. PTSD is a growing problem in many veteran’s due to their service and these fishing trips allow them to relax while fishing in the flowing rivers of East Tennessee. Chad Rogers is an active member of Project Healing Waters and he stated that, “Veterans are known for having bad knees so being in the water is one the best kinds of therapy.”</p>

<h3><strong>New Within Us App Connects People via the Exchange of Positivity</strong></h3>
<p>Within Us App, a new social media platform is set to launch in App Store January 2018. According to founder Ron Cardillo, the app will bring humanity together via the exchange of positive and beautiful messages.</p>
<p>""The Within Us App allows people to be the hero in someone else's story,"" says Ron Cardillo, Founder. Along with developers, he designed the messaging service specifically for people to comfort and connect with each other in times of hardship. Users can share experiences and words of encouragement with total anonymity and privacy, an amenity not afforded by typical applications. According to Cardillo, the new service will fill this void in the social media-scape.</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""360"" src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/241693014"" width=""640""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why we are raising money</h3>
</div><div>
<p>We need to raise the $50,000 for 3 specific reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>We need additional money to finish the iPhone version that will be available for Beta Testing this month, and launching in the App Store January 2018.</li>
<li>To advertise and promote awareness for the app so we can help as many people as possible as soon as possible.</li>
<li>To begin development on the Android &amp; Desktop versions of the app.</li>
</ol>
</div><div>
<h3>Helping others through the power of hope.</h3>
<p>When people are feeling lost, hopeless, or in despair, they will be able to turn to Within Us app for help. There, they can listen to and take solace in stories from others who have been in similar situations and prevailed. It is a discrete way for people to support, motivate, and inspire each other in an authentic and altruistic way. The ultimate goal behind the app is to help people feel less alone, especially in times of crisis. To complement the experience of sharing beautiful messages, the messaging platform comes complete with an enchanting interactive display.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Be one of the first to use the Within Us app</h3>

</div></div>","New Within Us App Connects People via the Exchange of Positivity
Within Us App, a new social media platform is set to launch in App Store January 2018. According to founder Ron Cardillo, the app will bring humanity together via the exchange of positive and beautiful messages.
""The Within Us App allows people to be the hero in someone else's story,"" says Ron Cardillo, Founder. Along with developers, he designed the messaging service specifically for people to comfort and connect with each other in times of hardship. Users can share experiences and words of encouragement with total anonymity and privacy, an amenity not afforded by typical applications. According to Cardillo, the new service will fill this void in the social media-scape.

 
Why we are raising money

We need to raise the $50,000 for 3 specific reasons:

We need additional money to finish the iPhone version that will be available for Beta Testing this month, and launching in the App Store January 2018.
To advertise and promote awareness for the app so we can help as many people as possible as soon as possible.
To begin development on the Android & Desktop versions of the app.


Helping others through the power of hope.
When people are feeling lost, hopeless, or in despair, they will be able to turn to Within Us app for help. There, they can listen to and take solace in stories from others who have been in similar situations and prevailed. It is a discrete way for people to support, motivate, and inspire each other in an authentic and altruistic way. The ultimate goal behind the app is to help people feel less alone, especially in times of crisis. To complement the experience of sharing beautiful messages, the messaging platform comes complete with an enchanting interactive display.

Be one of the first to use the Within Us app
The application will be ready for download for iPhone users from the App Store January 2018. If you would like to take part in Beta testing and become among the first to experience the app in mid-November, those interested should email the company at info@withinusapp.com or visit http://www.withinusapp.com/beta-sign-up to sign up.

<p>Given the best tools and the right encouragement people can be exactly who they want to be, this workbook is designed to help them get there.</p>
<p>This workbook is the culmination of many years of helping people to create the change they want to see in their own lives, to embrace their personal autonomy and fulfill their own potential, something I have worked with people on since 2004, in small learning groups and 1-2-1 coaching and, latterly in my private clinic work, in face to face workshops and, for the past 3 years, via online Zoom activities.</p>
<p>My careers centred around managing change and supporting people to negotiate change as effectively and efficiently as possible, certain in the knowledge that self directed change is always more sustainable than change that feels forced or controlled by someone else.</p>
<p>My studies into people both physiologically and psychologically has given me amazing insights into how our brains work, so this workbook actively stimulates the right brain, our creative centre, and places creativity at the centre of the changes you  make as you work through the book, it’s a beautiful fusion of practicality, creativity and dynamic growth.</p>
<p>I’m Claire and the bundle of fluffy goodness I’m cuddling is my dog pTerry.   I have been a kinesiology practitioner for 15 years and was blown away by the versatility and relevance of the Chinese five element theory, studying it alongside my work as a change management coach and a psychology studies.</p>
<p>I have spent the last 16 months creating this book, getting down the ideas and carefully crafting useful insights, practical activities and gently probing questions.  Through conversations with illustrators, anatomical people, technical editors and user testers it is now ready to have the final illustrations drawn and to be printed and bound.  </p>
<p>Your contribution as part of our crowd funding community will make this possible by funding the final steps of this journey and get the book out into the world.  </p>
<p>Since I have created this book  in my own time, your contributions will pay for the final illustrations and print, there will also be a website upgrade to allow people access to new tools and ideas and some videos to add another dimension to the power of the activities in the book.</p>
<p>When I sat down to work out what else was needed and costing it out I was surprised and delighted to find that your contribution will make a significant impact in making this project a physical reality in a very short space of time and we don’t need to raise a huge amount to make that happen.</p>
<p>Here’s a chart showing the breakdown of what your valuable contribution will support</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1583427903/swsdgvhmp4mjsj6odb9l.png"" src=""""/><p>The most substantial costs cover Illustrations, printing and marketing/promotional activities, which makes sense for a book in the final stages of production.  </p>
<p>Some website development work is required to support downloads, and a shop where people can buy the workbook ongoing.  </p>
<p>I’m working with a lovely graphic designer who is taking on some design concepts for the cover and some of the other lovely bundle goodies so she gets a slice of the pie too.</p>
<p>I am ever grateful to John Thie and his Touch for Health Synthesis for the impact it has had on my life and, by way of thanks I have elected to donate £1, from every book sold through this crowd funding campaign, to the UK Touch for Health Charity, which endeavours to support those who wish to share or learn TFH and are unable to do so due to financial constraints.  They provide training bursaries and support outreach activities to share the magic of Touch for health with as many people as possible. More can be found out about their work at .<a href=""https://www.touchforhealthcharity.com/about"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.touchforhealthcharity.com/about</a></p>
<p>I’ve had  fun creating some lovely perks for the wonderful people who support the crowd funding and I’ve gathered them together into bundles so you can choose how you want to treat yourself.  I hope you like them too.</p>
<p>The annual pass to the monthly workshops is a real bonus.  Many of the workshop attendees have remarked how powerful they find these online workshops,  helping them to stay on track and gain clearer insights into how they respond to change through the year.  This workbook was devised to work along the same pathway and can be used in conjunction with the online gatherings or on its own, either way you maintain the impetus to move forward with the momentum of change and enhance the outcomes of all your efforts.</p>
<p>Some of the bundles contain signed workbooks, with a personal message from me as a token of my appreciation of your faith in me and to remind you that I believe in you too, I know that, given the best tools and resources, you can make the changes you want.  </p>
<p>The postcards are little gems to prompt you as you progress through the workbook, maybe frame them or put them somewhere to remind you of useful insights on each stage of your journey, use them to reflect how far you’ve come and acknowledge the progress you are making, great for a daily reminder if you hit a sticking point or feel overwhelm creeping back in. </p>
<p>The poster gives you clarity on the bigger picture too, prompting you to reflect on what’s most important for the stage you're at and it’s a useful size you can put up somewhere to refer to, without feeling you’ve redecorated the whole room.</p>
<p>The Impact</p>
<p>The work book adds another dimension to the work I’ve been delivering over the past three years, working face to face on a 1-2-1 basis and, even with small groups means I am organically spreading the word but, for some people it can feel daunting or it just may not be a possibility for various reasons.  </p>
<p>I created this workbook to allow many more people to access and use these self development tools in a supportive, creative way that will enable them to create the change they desire at a pace that works for them, offering a chink of light and, hopefully, opening a door through which they can grow the resilience to pursue the life they desire.</p>
<p>Books are a safe entry point for people as they try to get on a different path, they are safe spaces that the reader can choose to inhabit and engage with as/when they wish.  </p>
<p>Reaching a cross-roads in life can be overwhelming, it’s easy to get inundated with well meaning advice from those around us and giving ourselves permission to embrace something when we are ready, is extremely empowering.  This simple act of personal choice can be a catalyst for substantial change, especially when taken one step at a time, or in this case, one page at a time.</p>
<p>Your treasured contribution opens the door for this resource to be printed, purchased and gifted to anyone who would like a helping hand with change and has no idea where to start.  That’s a huge impact so, from all of those who don’t even know about this workbook yet, I’m sending you their thanks too, because of you their change will happen and their situation will improve.</p>
<p>The donations to the Touch for Health UK charity will help them spread the word about positive and profound techniques lay people can use to help them feel better both inside and out, another fabulous impact of your involvement in this simple project, Thank you from them too.</p>
<p>I have a team of people who have and are supporting me, many of whom are based local to me here in Yorkshire, so, your valuable contribution assists small businesses to flourish too, which certainly gives me a lovely warm feeling, I hope it does for you too.  </p>

was a spiritual person and needed spiritual training to reach my full
potential. In 2002, I walked into the Chagdud Gonpa Tromge Ling meditation
center, and immediately knew I was home. It was there that I was introduced to
the late Lama Chödak Gyatso Nubpa and Lama Zangpo and received
guidance to start my spiritual journey. Later in 2006, Lama Tsering gave me
instructions to follow through and complete the Ngondro practices.For those of you who are not familiar with Tibetan Buddhism, Ngondro is a powerful and profound collection of foundational practices that prepares one for deep transformation. It is a preliminary practice that, once completed, allows one to receive further teachings. After ten years, I finished my first Ngondro.I am grateful that years of practice has brought me to where I am today. In 2011, I was offered the opportunity to serve as a staff member at Rigdzin Ling.  As fast as I could, I left my job, hopped in the car, drove 2000 miles from Minnesota to California, and I have never looked back. Every moment I've lived at Rigdzin Ling, I've been in the presence of Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche's blessings and I am grateful to live a life where my spiritual practice is very significant. I am learning generosity through my actions: managing the butterlamp house, maintaning acres of gardens, supporting ritual arts in the shrine room, and helping as needed around the land.I am passionate about living at Rigdzin Ling as a volunteer, to live and support the dharma, but as a full-time volunteer my financial resources have become limited. Gardening with Rigdzin Ling dog.                  Singing butterlamp prayers.Drumming in the shrine.What I Am Asking For The teachings offered to students who have finished their Ngondro practice within this tradition are only given once a year in January at Khadro Ling, Brazil. The training will be rigorous with long hours for 29 days straight.  Now is the time to attend these teachings, because I have the time to do so.  Like most folks, when I have been employed in healthcare, I did not have much vacation time beyond a week or two, even though I had the financial resources for extended travel. And while I have the time now, my financial resources are limited, which is why I am asking for your help.  The costs, in US dollars, for the retreat will be as follows:

<h2>Why Support My Beyond Boundaries Equine Retreat?</h2>
<p><i>Because horses talk to all of us, and we all have the potential to hear what they say...</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551353817/d16l6eac4xjcg0ztxsbp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>How The Idea Was Born </h3>
<p>When I was a child and I had the opportunity to be in the same space as a horse, I remember there was a feeling of sharing. We knew who we were. Their gentleness and love was natural. They saw the same love in me, they expected it. It felt like being at home in a place we never needed to leave. </p>
<p>I was often attracted to horses who were said to be difficult or dangerous because the togetherness feeling was often stronger with them. As long as I could be still and listen. </p>
<p>Then I grew up and began to absorb different teachings. Most of the time they were about how to control and subdue a horse. That was just how things were done. I became ambitious and started to compete in Show Jumping and then Dressage. </p>
<p>One day when I was twenty years old, I was preparing to compete in a Dressage competition in Edinburgh. I was riding my own young mare I had trained myself, and suddenly I realised that although we were both together in this collecting ring, it was the last place she wanted to be. I felt rejected and miserable because I understood that the natural love I used to share with horses in the beginning was gone. </p>
<p>I devoted the next twenty years of my life finding it again. First I learned what horses need from us physically and emotionally by listening to their state of being, and gradually the ability to perceive that grew and developed. </p>
<p>I have begun to teach and share this connection with other horse guardians and their ability is very exciting. They feel it too! And it is transforming their equine relationships already. </p>
<p>It has recently become clear that creating an Equine Retreat Centre where groups of horse lovers of any experience can come and absorb this language is the way forward. Although it may start out as a trickle, the movement will grow and strengthen and ultimately a whole new perspective on having horses in our lives will flourish. </p>
<h3>My Background</h3>
<p>My name is Camille Dareau, I am 43 years old and have been learning from horses since I was a child. I trained as a Craniosacral Therapist in my twenties and have been continuing to develop a therapeutic approach to horse keeping and horse training since then. When I understood how powerful the innate healing intelligence of all living creatures is, it seemed like the answer to many issues that come up in life in general. </p>
<p>Along with my sister we learned the value of a holistic way of looking after horses. Starting with barefoot, then stable-free and rug-free and allowing horses to choose their own companions and live as a herd. Now I even encourage them to choose their own minerals and medicinal herbs. We also studied in depth how it was possible to ride and train horses in a way that was therapeutic for both horse and rider. I was particularly interested in rehabilitating traumatised horses. This led to my personal awakening to the energetic connection, and I have been learning how to communicate with horses in this way ever since. </p>
<p>After my husband and I were married for a couple of years we were able to move into our beautiful farm, Labarrére, here in the South West of France. It took all of our resources to be able to accomplish this. We have been through some testing times, but they have only made our resolve to succeed here stronger. Founding the Beyond Boundaries Equine Retreat will create a home for the energetic connection, the 'voice of the horses', where it can grow and flourish. Your support is about investing in an awakening of consciousness for horse owners which could profoundly improve the lives of future generations of horses.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551354660/cj0ahsnznzyqw3dioaeo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>What We Need To Create The Retreat Centre</h3>
<p>I have always reinvested my own money and that of my wonderful supporters into supporting my herd of horses and funding my work with them. This has enabled my approach to be shared with other horse guardians. At this point we have reached an impasse and we need help to reach the next level. The money we raise from this campaign will be used for the project in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>To finish the outdoor horse arena i.e drainage, surfacing and fencing.</li>
<li>To add a second bathroom for guests in the farmhouse.</li>
<li>To expand the kitchen area in order to provide dining for our guests.</li>
<li>To continue to develop course material for the Beyond Boundaries Equine Retreat. </li>
<li>To advertise the Beyond Boundaries Equine Retreat. </li>
<li>To provide linens and hospitality infrastructure for our guests. </li>
</ul>
<p>Our intention is to begin offering the retreats as soon as possible. We would like to begin welcoming participants as early as June and July Summer 2019.  Our priority for the funds we receive will be the facilities to accommodate guests.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a href=""https://www.happyhorsehappyhuman.com/horse-holiday/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">What The Retreat Can Offer Participants</a></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551519629/dcfbpcr2ixwoli1o4tei.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>One of my strengths is to merge boundaries and bring concepts which are apparently separate, together. There are so many boundaries in the equestrian world. Natural Horsemanship and Classical Dressage for example, or even simpler, flat work and jumping. There are always underlying connections to be made, however. Whoever you are and whatever discipline you practice with horses, one of the most important things, if not the most important thing for you, is your relationship with your horse. If that isn't working, then nothing is working. </p>
<p>This is why the Beyond Boundaries Equine retreat is so valuable. It doesn't matter what your experience is, we all have something to learn about relationships, and going beneath all of the 'doing' and the 'making' is where those answers are found. </p>
<p>The retreat is divided into six topics for six days. It starts out more general, addressing the ways horses behave in a herd, and how we as humans can be part of that. Throughout the week we will go deeper into the essence of communication, how we can genuinely dialogue and read horses, and to have an in-depth understanding of the influence we are have. By the last day we are moving into the pure energetic language that exists between us. It is a magical experience to be 'seen' by a horse, sometimes for the first time. </p>
<p>It sounds like an exaggeration to say that this week could change your life, but this work has done that many times already for many horse lovers. It is not about imposing a plan of action which will change your horse's behaviour and solve all of your problems overnight. Those 'magic bullet' approaches can create more harm than they ever resolve. This immersive experience is about discovering the resources you already have inside you. Once you have found them, they are a doorway to a new space with horses. It is about stepping into another awareness where you feel  the horse in a way that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gives you confidence because you <strong>understand why you were afraid</strong>.<strong> </strong>
</li>
<li>Enables you to <strong>perceive how your horse feels</strong>.</li>
<li>Allows you to <strong>see the source of your horse's behaviour as well as your own</strong>. </li>
<li>Teaches you how to <strong>follow your perception and trust your own intuition</strong>. </li>
<li>Shows you <strong>how to touch your horse in a way that is therapeutic</strong> for them and you. </li>
<li>Encourages you to <strong>discover the exciting new world of energetic dialogue</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although this retreat can certainly be a springboard for other activities with horses, it is not a riding holiday. I do believe that riding can be the ultimate horse human connection, although often it is when most of the damage to the relationship is done. Learning a different foundation means that all of those mistakes can be resolved. This is an opportunity to start over again right at the beginning. To get back to that sharing place. The time before anything went wrong, or simply where the magic begins. Most of us think we know horses. If I have learned one thing, it is that we don't, not really. There is a vast undiscovered realm yet to be experienced, and this could be your way in. </p>
<p><strong><i>The Beyond Boundaries equine retreat is not teaching you what to do or even how to be, it is about connecting you back to the wisdom you already possess. Your own limitless potential. </i></strong></p>

<h3><a href=""https://www.happyhorsehappyhuman.com/horse-holiday/equine-retreat/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Retreat Schedule </a></h3>
<p>Everyone will arrive in the evening so we have a chance to talk (horses) and get to know each other a bit. The Summer evenings in Southwest France are usually balmy and beautiful, and the horses are not far away. Everyone will receive a handbook with the activities for the week and notes, so they can relax and not have to think about writing things down. There will be space for personal notes also, to remember lightbulb moments and experiences. Every day we will have a group discussion in the early evening to answer any questions and further explore the ideas and experiences of the day. </p>
<p><u><strong>1. Herd Dynamics: </strong></u></p>
<ol>
<li>In the morning we will be <strong>spending time with the herd and observing their relationships</strong>. The idea is to get to know the herd and see how they behave around each other so that we can understand how to enter their world safely. Not everyone has had the opportunity to become truly comfortable around horses living in their own world. We need that skill to be able to let go of the control mechanisms we have built up for horses. For example, if you feel happier when your horse has a head-collar on, or equally if your horse seems better behaved with a head-collar on, then there is an unresolved communication issue in the relationship. </li>
<li>We will have a <strong>group discussion about safety in the herd</strong>, including where to position ourselves and how to respond in different situations. </li>
<li>We will have a <strong>group exercise addressing knowing our own energy</strong> and what we are bringing to the horses. </li>
<li>In the afternoon we will be <strong>working within the herd on an individual basis</strong>, or in pairs, to experience the reality of feeling comfortable interacting with the herd of horses.</li>
</ol>
<p><u><strong>2. Intelligent Touch:</strong></u></p>
<ol>
<li><p>We will start in the morning <strong>discussing the concept of choice and how it applies to horses</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Followed by a practical session, starting with a <strong>demonstration of how to ask a horse for their permission</strong>. Both asking and reading the horse’s responses is a fascinating process and encourages us to develop a more sensitive awareness of the way horses express themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>In the afternoon we will be <strong>exploring therapeutic grooming</strong>. Therapeutic grooming makes the practice of grooming into a meditation and a therapy. It is a way to create trust through acknowledgement of the horse's feelings. These feelings are usually physical, but may be emotional also. Most of the exercises we do will be demonstrated and then there will be plenty of opportunity for participants to practice and experience it for themselves. </p></li>
</ol>
<p><u><strong>3. Mutual Yielding </strong></u></p>
<ol>
<li><p>We will start off in perhaps more familiar territory by <strong>using yielding of the horse as another line of communication</strong>. The purpose is not so much about controlling the horse or the situation, but learning how to speak their language through this particular form of physical connection. It is very much about bonding and mutual trust as opposed to separation which some forms of yielding can result in. </p></li>
<li><p>In the afternoon the subject becomes less familiar when we start to <strong>explore our own ability to yield</strong>. many of us have been deeply conditioned that this is not a good idea, that we have to ‘be the boss’ and have our boundaries respected. I have come to understand that true harmony can only come from mutual vulnerability, which is the same as mutual trust. Until we can understand how to yield to a horse, we will not experience the flow of an authentic partnership.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><u><strong>4. Introducing Equipment</strong></u></p>
<ol>
<li>We will start by <strong>discussing the difference between having an agenda and an intention</strong> when it comes to working with horses.</li>
<li>Then we will look at <strong>introducing a head-collar, how to do so in dialogue with a horse</strong>. Participants will be able to practice with individual horses and explore their own ability to perceive the communication. </li>
<li>In the afternoon we will follow a similar plan, but this time <strong>working with potentially more contentious equipment, such as bridles and saddles</strong>. I don't use bits anymore, but even so, any tack that a horse associates with being ridden can bring up negative associations. We will see how to work with and resolve these issues. </li>
</ol>
<p><u><strong>5. Connected Guidance </strong></u></p>
<ol>
<li>This is a <strong>development of yielding with a horse which is beginning to introduce straightness and therefore balance</strong>. We will see how physical guidance through contact becomes less physical and more energetic as the connection is established between human and horse.</li>
<li>
<strong>Everyone will have a chance to practice this</strong>, both in the morning and afternoon. </li>
</ol>
<p><u><strong>6. Perceiving The Boundaries</strong></u></p>
<ol>
<li>The last day we will be ready to <strong>explore more deeply into the energetic connection </strong>and what it really feels like in relation to horses. We will start with the herd, who everyone will be familiar with by now, and focus on what it is to perceive their boundary. This can be a magical experience, and often it will open up a new dimension of understanding.</li>
<li>We will move on to <strong>feeling individual horse's boundaries</strong> and explore what they represent how to respond to them.</li>
<li>In the afternoon we will have a <strong>final group discussion which will consolidate what we have done and talk about how to continue to evolve at home</strong> with everyone's own horses. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Extras by Arrangement</h3>
<p>Some further opportunities we can offer guests during their stay:</p>
<ul>

<h3>Personal Reasons For You To Support Our Venture </h3>
<p>Maybe you are a horse owner who is searching for a new way to relate to your horse. Maybe you have discarded some techniques and are experimenting with others, yet you still find there is something missing. Maybe you are experiencing some level of stress or conflict coming between you and your horse(s). This retreat is the perfect opportunity to move through the language barrier into a more profound relationship with your horse. Think of it as a step by step guide to confidence and mutual comprehension. Are any of these questions familiar? </p>
<ol>
<li>Do you <i>feel nervous</i> <i>standing near or around horses</i>, in a herd or individually?</li>
<li>Does it seem <i>more comfortable for you when you have a head-collar</i> on your horse? </li>
<li>Do you <i>worry about how your horse will behave</i> in a strange situation? </li>
<li>Do you frequently <i>feel in danger of being shoved or stepped on</i> by horses? </li>
<li>Is there <i>a behaviour in your horse you want to fix</i>, but don't know how?</li>
<li>Is your <i>relationship with your horse based solely around food</i>? </li>
<li>Do you <i>wish you felt inspired to spend more time </i>with your horses? </li>
</ol>
<p>These questions do not carry any judgment, if you haven't been in those situations or experiences some of those feelings then you probably haven't been around horses very much! <strong>There <i>are</i> solutions, and they are solutions which will bring you closer to every horse you come into contact with as well as closer to understanding yourself.</strong> <strong>Best of all they don't have to involve force and pushing yourself to be someone you are not. </strong></p>
<p>Some more benefits that participants can enjoy:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is an introduction to a new way of relating to horses which can transform your life.</p></li>
<li><p>Achieving  greater understanding of your emotional/physical self and how it influences horses.</p></li>
<li><p>Experiences with happy, holistic horses who are also wise and generous teachers.</p></li>
<li><p>A valuable opportunity to acknowledge and release negative horse-related experiences.</p></li>
<li><p>Great company in beautiful surroundings with delicious food!</p></li>
<li><p>Ongoing support with your own horse/herd. </p></li>
<li><p>Gaining the experience to share your understanding further in the horse world. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551618702/fgfexaksgclsdyypd2mk.jpg"" src=""""/></p></li>

<h3>How To Help Rescued And Traumatised Horses</h3>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","Why Support My Beyond Boundaries Equine Retreat?
Because horses talk to all of us, and we all have the potential to hear what they say...

How The Idea Was Born 
When I was a child and I had the opportunity to be in the same space as a horse, I remember there was a feeling of sharing. We knew who we were. Their gentleness and love was natural. They saw the same love in me, they expected it. It felt like being at home in a place we never needed to leave. 
I was often attracted to horses who were said to be difficult or dangerous because the togetherness feeling was often stronger with them. As long as I could be still and listen. 
Then I grew up and began to absorb different teachings. Most of the time they were about how to control and subdue a horse. That was just how things were done. I became ambitious and started to compete in Show Jumping and then Dressage. 
One day when I was twenty years old, I was preparing to compete in a Dressage competition in Edinburgh. I was riding my own young mare I had trained myself, and suddenly I realised that although we were both together in this collecting ring, it was the last place she wanted to be. I felt rejected and miserable because I understood that the natural love I used to share with horses in the beginning was gone. 
I devoted the next twenty years of my life finding it again. First I learned what horses need from us physically and emotionally by listening to their state of being, and gradually the ability to perceive that grew and developed. 
I have begun to teach and share this connection with other horse guardians and their ability is very exciting. They feel it too! And it is transforming their equine relationships already. 
It has recently become clear that creating an Equine Retreat Centre where groups of horse lovers of any experience can come and absorb this language is the way forward. Although it may start out as a trickle, the movement will grow and strengthen and ultimately a whole new perspective on having horses in our lives will flourish. 
My Background
My name is Camille Dareau, I am 43 years old and have been learning from horses since I was a child. I trained as a Craniosacral Therapist in my twenties and have been continuing to develop a therapeutic approach to horse keeping and horse training since then. When I understood how powerful the innate healing intelligence of all living creatures is, it seemed like the answer to many issues that come up in life in general. 
Along with my sister we learned the value of a holistic way of looking after horses. Starting with barefoot, then stable-free and rug-free and allowing horses to choose their own companions and live as a herd. Now I even encourage them to choose their own minerals and medicinal herbs. We also studied in depth how it was possible to ride and train horses in a way that was therapeutic for both horse and rider. I was particularly interested in rehabilitating traumatised horses. This led to my personal awakening to the energetic connection, and I have been learning how to communicate with horses in this way ever since. 
After my husband and I were married for a couple of years we were able to move into our beautiful farm, Labarrére, here in the South West of France. It took all of our resources to be able to accomplish this. We have been through some testing times, but they have only made our resolve to succeed here stronger. Founding the Beyond Boundaries Equine Retreat will create a home for the energetic connection, the 'voice of the horses', where it can grow and flourish. Your support is about investing in an awakening of consciousness for horse owners which could profoundly improve the lives of future generations of horses.  

What We Need To Create The Retreat Centre
I have always reinvested my own money and that of my wonderful supporters into supporting my herd of horses and funding my work with them. This has enabled my approach to be shared with other horse guardians. At this point we have reached an impasse and we need help to reach the next level. The money we raise from this campaign will be used for the project in the following ways:

To finish the outdoor horse arena i.e drainage, surfacing and fencing.
To add a second bathroom for guests in the farmhouse.
To expand the kitchen area in order to provide dining for our guests.
To continue to develop course material for the Beyond Boundaries Equine Retreat. 
To advertise the Beyond Boundaries Equine Retreat. 
To provide linens and hospitality infrastructure for our guests. 

Our intention is to begin offering the retreats as soon as possible. We would like to begin welcoming participants as early as June and July Summer 2019.  Our priority for the funds we receive will be the facilities to accommodate guests.
 
What The Retreat Can Offer Participants

One of my strengths is to merge boundaries and bring concepts which are apparently separate, together. There are so many boundaries in the equestrian world. Natural Horsemanship and Classical Dressage for example, or even simpler, flat work and jumping. There are always underlying connections to be made, however. Whoever you are and whatever discipline you practice with horses, one of the most important things, if not the most important thing for you, is your relationship with your horse. If that isn't working, then nothing is working. 
This is why the Beyond Boundaries Equine retreat is so valuable. It doesn't matter what your experience is, we all have something to learn about relationships, and going beneath all of the 'doing' and the 'making' is where those answers are found. 
The retreat is divided into six topics for six days. It starts out more general, addressing the ways horses behave in a herd, and how we as humans can be part of that. Throughout the week we will go deeper into the essence of communication, how we can genuinely dialogue and read horses, and to have an in-depth understanding of the influence we are have. By the last day we are moving into the pure energetic language that exists between us. It is a magical experience to be 'seen' by a horse, sometimes for the first time. 
It sounds like an exaggeration to say that this week could change your life, but this work has done that many times already for many horse lovers. It is not about imposing a plan of action which will change your horse's behaviour and solve all of your problems overnight. Those 'magic bullet' approaches can create more harm than they ever resolve. This immersive experience is about discovering the resources you already have inside you. Once you have found them, they are a doorway to a new space with horses. It is about stepping into another awareness where you feel  the horse in a way that:

Gives you confidence because you understand why you were afraid. 

Enables you to perceive how your horse feels.
Allows you to see the source of your horse's behaviour as well as your own. 
Teaches you how to follow your perception and trust your own intuition. 
Shows you how to touch your horse in a way that is therapeutic for them and you. 
Encourages you to discover the exciting new world of energetic dialogue.

Although this retreat can certainly be a springboard for other activities with horses, it is not a riding holiday. I do believe that riding can be the ultimate horse human connection, although often it is when most of the damage to the relationship is done. Learning a different foundation means that all of those mistakes can be resolved. This is an opportunity to start over again right at the beginning. To get back to that sharing place. The time before anything went wrong, or simply where the magic begins. Most of us think we know horses. If I have learned one thing, it is that we don't, not really. There is a vast undiscovered realm yet to be experienced, and this could be your way in. 
The Beyond Boundaries equine retreat is not teaching you what to do or even how to be, it is about connecting you back to the wisdom you already possess. Your own limitless potential. 

The Retreat Schedule 
Everyone will arrive in the evening so we have a chance to talk (horses) and get to know each other a bit. The Summer evenings in Southwest France are usually balmy and beautiful, and the horses are not far away. Everyone will receive a handbook with the activities for the week and notes, so they can relax and not have to think about writing things down. There will be space for personal notes also, to remember lightbulb moments and experiences. Every day we will have a group discussion in the early evening to answer any questions and further explore the ideas and experiences of the day. 
1. Herd Dynamics: 

In the morning we will be spending time with the herd and observing their relationships. The idea is to get to know the herd and see how they behave around each other so that we can understand how to enter their world safely. Not everyone has had the opportunity to become truly comfortable around horses living in their own world. We need that skill to be able to let go of the control mechanisms we have built up for horses. For example, if you feel happier when your horse has a head-collar on, or equally if your horse seems better behaved with a head-collar on, then there is an unresolved communication issue in the relationship. 
We will have a group discussion about safety in the herd, including where to position ourselves and how to respond in different situations. 
We will have a group exercise addressing knowing our own energy and what we are bringing to the horses. 
In the afternoon we will be working within the herd on an individual basis, or in pairs, to experience the reality of feeling comfortable interacting with the herd of horses.

2. Intelligent Touch:

We will start in the morning discussing the concept of choice and how it applies to horses.
Followed by a practical session, starting with a demonstration of how to ask a horse for their permission. Both asking and reading the horse’s responses is a fascinating process and encourages us to develop a more sensitive awareness of the way horses express themselves.
In the afternoon we will be exploring therapeutic grooming. Therapeutic grooming makes the practice of grooming into a meditation and a therapy. It is a way to create trust through acknowledgement of the horse's feelings. These feelings are usually physical, but may be emotional also. Most of the exercises we do will be demonstrated and then there will be plenty of opportunity for participants to practice and experience it for themselves. 

3. Mutual Yielding 

We will start off in perhaps more familiar territory by using yielding of the horse as another line of communication. The purpose is not so much about controlling the horse or the situation, but learning how to speak their language through this particular form of physical connection. It is very much about bonding and mutual trust as opposed to separation which some forms of yielding can result in. 
In the afternoon the subject becomes less familiar when we start to explore our own ability to yield. many of us have been deeply conditioned that this is not a good idea, that we have to ‘be the boss’ and have our boundaries respected. I have come to understand that true harmony can only come from mutual vulnerability, which is the same as mutual trust. Until we can understand how to yield to a horse, we will not experience the flow of an authentic partnership.

4. Introducing Equipment

We will start by discussing the difference between having an agenda and an intention when it comes to working with horses.
Then we will look at introducing a head-collar, how to do so in dialogue with a horse. Participants will be able to practice with individual horses and explore their own ability to perceive the communication. 
In the afternoon we will follow a similar plan, but this time working with potentially more contentious equipment, such as bridles and saddles. I don't use bits anymore, but even so, any tack that a horse associates with being ridden can bring up negative associations. We will see how to work with and resolve these issues. 

5. Connected Guidance 

This is a development of yielding with a horse which is beginning to introduce straightness and therefore balance. We will see how physical guidance through contact becomes less physical and more energetic as the connection is established between human and horse.

Everyone will have a chance to practice this, both in the morning and afternoon. 

6. Perceiving The Boundaries

The last day we will be ready to explore more deeply into the energetic connection and what it really feels like in relation to horses. We will start with the herd, who everyone will be familiar with by now, and focus on what it is to perceive their boundary. This can be a magical experience, and often it will open up a new dimension of understanding.
We will move on to feeling individual horse's boundaries and explore what they represent how to respond to them.
In the afternoon we will have a final group discussion which will consolidate what we have done and talk about how to continue to evolve at home with everyone's own horses. 


Extras by Arrangement
Some further opportunities we can offer guests during their stay:

Craniosacral Therapy session. 
Therapeutic Riding Session.
Early morning wood walks with the dogs. (no extra charge!)
Crystal bowl session. 
Evening meal at a French restaurant with delicious food. 

Personal Reasons For You To Support Our Venture 
Maybe you are a horse owner who is searching for a new way to relate to your horse. Maybe you have discarded some techniques and are experimenting with others, yet you still find there is something missing. Maybe you are experiencing some level of stress or conflict coming between you and your horse(s). This retreat is the perfect opportunity to move through the language barrier into a more profound relationship with your horse. Think of it as a step by step guide to confidence and mutual comprehension. Are any of these questions familiar? 

Do you feel nervous standing near or around horses, in a herd or individually?
Does it seem more comfortable for you when you have a head-collar on your horse? 
Do you worry about how your horse will behave in a strange situation? 
Do you frequently feel in danger of being shoved or stepped on by horses? 
Is there a behaviour in your horse you want to fix, but don't know how?
Is your relationship with your horse based solely around food? 
Do you wish you felt inspired to spend more time with your horses? 

These questions do not carry any judgment, if you haven't been in those situations or experiences some of those feelings then you probably haven't been around horses very much! There are solutions, and they are solutions which will bring you closer to every horse you come into contact with as well as closer to understanding yourself. Best of all they don't have to involve force and pushing yourself to be someone you are not. 
Some more benefits that participants can enjoy:

This is an introduction to a new way of relating to horses which can transform your life.
Achieving  greater understanding of your emotional/physical self and how it influences horses.
Experiences with happy, holistic horses who are also wise and generous teachers.
A valuable opportunity to acknowledge and release negative horse-related experiences.
Great company in beautiful surroundings with delicious food!
Ongoing support with your own horse/herd. 
Gaining the experience to share your understanding further in the horse world. 

How To Help Rescued And Traumatised Horses
I mentioned at the top that as  child I felt a particular bond with troubled horses. There are many horses who have suffered at the hands of ignorance and human ambition. I have been particularly passionate in my life to help such horses find their horse-ness again, and that has been educational and healing in itself.  
I do believe that we need them as much, if not more than they  need us. Horses are deeply spiritual beings. The energy we bring in our relationships with them can open a healing channel which flows both ways.
The key to healing is being able to acknowledge what is there, both in ourselves and in our horses. The Beyond Boundaries Equine Retreat is a map which guides that path. The horses in my life have demonstrated time after time the possibilities, and the potential for healing which exists. If you have a horse with issues, and you have some issues with horses, feel inspired to find your solution! It certainly exists.

<h3>The Story on Aether Wellness</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm <strong>Alyssa</strong> (she/her) and I'm the founder of Aether Wellness. (Psst ""Aether"" is like ""ether""--just the British spelling because the AE represents my initials!) </p>
<p>Aether is a culmination of my passion for how the body moves; a mix of yoga and bodywork (plus eventually nutrition) for all-around wellness that balances your mind, soul, and body. </p>
<p><strong>Starting a business during a pandemic is tough</strong>, and I've taken some big leaps already with my funds (like getting a shiatsu table and investing in custom bolsters!). Coming up with the costs associated with my licensure, insurance, software needs, and other start up costs all at once is tough when I can't actually practice until the company is official.</p>
<p><i>That is where I'm hoping you come in. </i></p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><b>My goal is to raise $2,500. </b>My projected expenses for the first three months of business (outlined below) total a little over $1,900, and Indiegogo will keep about $100 of that. Additionally I am hoping for a $500 cushion for unforeseen expenses (and a bottle of good wine to celebrate the official launch!)</p>

</div></div>","The Story on Aether Wellness
Hi! I'm Alyssa (she/her) and I'm the founder of Aether Wellness. (Psst ""Aether"" is like ""ether""--just the British spelling because the AE represents my initials!) 
Aether is a culmination of my passion for how the body moves; a mix of yoga and bodywork (plus eventually nutrition) for all-around wellness that balances your mind, soul, and body. 
Starting a business during a pandemic is tough, and I've taken some big leaps already with my funds (like getting a shiatsu table and investing in custom bolsters!). Coming up with the costs associated with my licensure, insurance, software needs, and other start up costs all at once is tough when I can't actually practice until the company is official.
That is where I'm hoping you come in. 
 

What I Need & What You Get
My goal is to raise $2,500. My projected expenses for the first three months of business (outlined below) total a little over $1,900, and Indiegogo will keep about $100 of that. Additionally I am hoping for a $500 cushion for unforeseen expenses (and a bottle of good wine to celebrate the official launch!)
What you get for helping me:

for a $25 donation, you'll get 33% off a 60-minute session at Aether
for a $50 donation, you'll get 50% off a 90-minute session at Aether
for a $100 donation, you'll get 50% off a 90-minute session at Aether and you are entered in a drawing for a 120-minute shiatsu session

What I need to launch:

Certificate of Assumed Name ($50)
License - City of Minneapolis ($55)
Rent - studio space for three months ($725)
Website - annual hosting ($215)
Liability insurance ($150)
Electronic Health Record software ($80*3 months=$250)
Suction cupping set ($80)
Herbs for moxibustion ($20)
Auricular Therapy seeds and beads ($20)
Therapeutic magnets ($30)
Laundry detergent ($75)
Business cards ($20)
Fliers ($50)
Utilities for three months (estimate $200)
Fees from Indiegogo (estimate $100)

</div><p><b>About the Founder &amp; the Nonprofit</b></p>
<p>My name is Tina LeMar.
 I have been a yoga and meditation instructor for over fifteen years.
 It has been my passion and life for many years.  When people ask me
why I started teaching I always say the same thing...""It saved my
life.""  How, you ask?  I grew up afflicted with very low
self-esteem that led to panic attacks, agoraphobia, and severe anxiety.  I
also have scoliosis (curvature of the spine) which made my spine very weak.
 I played a lot of sports growing up and it all made my back much worse. I
ended up with several herniated discs and was in severe pain for six months,
barely able to walk.  What saved me from the pain in my mind and in my
back?  YOGA &amp; MEDITATION.  With meditation my self-esteem and
confidence grew and it crushed my anxiety and panic attacks.  I am no
longer a victim of my mind.  And I rehabbed my back with yoga ONLY (and
Advil). Today I walk with strength and without pain.  It is truly amazing.
 THIS is how yoga and meditation saved my life.</p>
<p>I felt so incredibly
grateful that I became a yoga instructor, opened a business, and had a
successful business and practice for over fifteen years.  In all of those
years I met so many wonderful people, from all walks of life.  I met
people in chronic pain, people with unmanageable stress, people at the point of
breaking from sadness and low self esteem, people suffering with panic attacks,
agoraphobia, and anxiety and depression just as I had, addicts and alcoholics
and many more.  I was blessed to see, year after year, the incredible
changes that yoga and meditation had made on these individuals.  I
especially saw significant changes in people with chronic pain, addictions, and
low self esteem.  I saw these people, at the most raw state of being,
calling for help, with no strength or voice left.  These people were at
their end mentally and physically.  They wanted to die because they
thought it would be easier.  Yoga and meditation changed their lives.
 When they stretched they felt open, vulnerable, and able to cry and start
over.  When they meditated I asked them to speak kindly to themselves, to
tell themselves they are worthy of life and love and happiness.  They
smiled, and cried, and began to heal.  I saw it.  Right in front of
me.  It was glorious and beautiful.  I saw HOPE.</p>
<p>What Sheltered Yoga
does is bring HOPE and TOOLS TO REHABILITATE &amp; THRIVE to individuals just
like the ones I described. Through yoga, meditation, wellness and self esteem
workshops they learn to believe in themselves again.  To feel love that
lessens their fear.  To feel confidence and strength that abandons
weakness.  To work with their pain and change their relationship with it.
 To see and feel hope.  To LIVE instead of just SURVIVE.</p>
<p><b>What We Need </b></p>
<p>Sheltered Yoga is
asking for $5,000.  We hope to raise even more if possible.  This
money will go directly to funding the services we provide.  We hire
yoga/meditation instructors, psychologists, wellness coaches, inspirational
speakers on positive thinking, self esteem, and learning how to love oneself.
And we bring these workshops right into homeless and women's shelters in
Philadelphia and the surrounding area. We hope to expand to Camden, Trenton,
and Newark, NJ as well, as these are much needed locations. We offer the
professionals that we hire a competitive hourly wage in order to maintain
strong instructors that are consistent.  This in turn will help create
stability and openness within the homeless and women's communities. </p>

<h3>Hello, my name is Caroline North.  I would like to give you a little background on why I’m asking for your financial support.</h3>
<p>For the past 20 years, I have been teaching riding with an emphasis on developing the horse and human connection thorough balance of mind, body and spirit for the betterment and joy of both horse and rider. </p>
<p>My husband Matt and I own a riding stable located about 40 minutes south of Buffalo, NY. Our goal is to use Kripula Yoga techniques as the foundation to bring the benefits of the unique, but powerful, combination of yoga and horses to our students and students in our neighboring communities. </p>
<p>In my own pursuit of this balance, I turned to yoga. I have been practicing yoga on a regular basis for over 20 years. During that time, I realized the mindfulness, breath awareness, the nuances of physical and mental control yoga can develop greatly enhanced my skills as a rider and teacher.  These skills also helped connect me to my horses and enhance their lives and well-being on a much deeper level than I ever expected!</p>
<p>Over the years I have been introduced to a variety of yoga styles. Kripalu’s yoga program mirrors the balanced approach towards mind, body and spirit I use in my horsemanship program. This type of yoga stands out from all the rest which is why I'm turning to you for financial backing. I would like to train for my Kripalu Yoga Teacher Certification course in December, 2019.</p>
<h3>Why should you support me?</h3>
<p>Yoga has sustained the test of time as one of the oldest and most practiced mediums of generating balance, healing and connection.  I personally experience what powers can be revealed through practicing yoga.  Combining Kripalu yoga and the pureness of the horse allows students to flourish through teaching both yoga and horsemanship. It is a magical connection which will drive honest communication and lead to true healing. Your financial support will make a difference not just to me, but to many students in need of the horse and yoga connection to move forward in their lives. </p>
<p>I am convinced becoming a Kripalu yoga teacher certification is the key to opening the Light of Yoga that heals both body and mind. This course will give me the credentials to bring the best of yoga and horsemanship together to benefit students of all ages and abilities. </p>
<h3>The Impact on Many Lives</h3>
<p>The power of bringing yoga and horses together teaches joy and harmony and fosters relationships, our communities and our world. Research has shown countless numbers of people can be helped - those with PTSD, unbalanced emotional, physical or mental - backgrounds have all benefited through animals and yoga.</p>
<p>Being able to relate with another being is a fundamental ability we all need. Helping others learn to connect and balance their lives is an invaluable tool to navigate our world today.  I have already been doing this in a limited manner on my farm, now its time to branch out further into the community.</p>
<p>Please consider financially supporting me in my pursuit of providing an outstanding program. Reflect on the impact this unique opportunity will have in  student’s lives. I hope to offer this program to anybody who has an interest and hope to continue to move it forward with a Kripalu education. But remember, this is only the beginning.  In Western New York, our community centers lack gentle supportive physical programs for our seniors, youth and people seeking to stay closer to home.  My goal is to also teach in school programs, senior centers and provide classes in local parks and farms.</p>
<h3>What will I do for you?</h3>
<p>Check out the perks!  Cool mandalas, T-shirts and gift certificates! I will list all sponsors on my website (if authorized by the sponsor) and promote them at every public opportunity where I work or demonstrate my program. Please keep in mind you will be supporting something innovative and positive.  And finally, please keep in mind your support could be the key that provides the financial backing for a program that will change lives forever.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Being a Horsewoman and a farm owner, Caroline faces all sorts of physical, mental and financial challenges every day.  She has 20 years of experience in riding these challenges out, whether it's an upset horse, a bad hay year, a unexpected vet bill, or a struggling student. </p>
<p>She has learned how to adapt and change her perspective to come up with creative solutions to challenges, as well as the will to persevere.  Yoga has played a big part in knowing when to stop and rest, to change positions, and how to sacrifice some things and build on others.  She is confident with this breadth of experience, bringing Yoga to her corner of the world will be a resounding success!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In this Covid-crazy world, there's never been a more important time to focus on mental fitness. Stress, anxiety and uncertainty are at all time highs, and we need to work together to help each other through this. </p>
<p>We appreciate your support and this grassroots movement can't succeed without the backing of our community! Thank you!</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

<h3>Thank you all for taking the time to read this. As you all know, our beloved friend, brother, co-worker, family man, and 007 clone passed on St. Patrick's day. The most selfless man I know with the heart of gold always looked after all of us. He did it so well, he sacrificed his own health to do so. His life of servitude stood out as an all-encompassing hug to anyone and everyone around him. Very seldom did we get the chance to hug him back. Now is that chance. In order for us to give him the send-off he deserves and give each of us one last chance to see him, we are requesting some monetary assistance. While we all think he is worth the moon and the stars, whatever you can spare will go miles. I thank you all for the time and support during this challenging time. I/we love you all!</h3>

<h3>Every day we receive 3-4 new cases of sexual abuse.</h3>
<p>For a child who has experienced this trauma, the healing journey is crucial to each child living an emotionally, mentally, and physically healthy life.  Which is why we would like to bring the therapeutic experience of a healing garden to the Children’s Advocacy Center of Kent County.</p>
<p>The Healing Garden at the Children’s Advocacy Center of Kent County will be a space where children who have experienced the trauma of sexual abuse will be able to benefit from the therapeutic elements of nature. There will be native plantings, flowing water, and even a drum circle to provide sensory stimulation, which research shows has a positive impact on healing from trauma.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why would a healing garden be beneficial to the children that we serve?</h3>
<p>We have an opportunity to utilize nature as a healing tool for the children that we serve.  The outdoors is naturally restorative and therapeutic, and provides an opportunity for the children to work through their treatment process while experiencing the healing benefits of the outdoors.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How would the healing garden be incorporated into counseling sessions?</h3>
<p>The healing garden would be incorporated into practicing coping skills like mindfulness and relaxation techniques.  The garden can provide a richer sensory experience for the children to practice these skills.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Is there research on the positive impact of healing gardens on victims of trauma?</h3>
<p>Documented studies have explored the benefits of nature in working with trauma survivors.  The research has shown that the exposure to nature has had many benefits, including; decreasing stress and anxiety, and increasing relaxation and self-esteem.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How can you get involved?</h3>
<p>Support the campaign by purchasing a garden feature or making a contribution!  The Children’s Advocacy Center supports children at their most vulnerable: when they are recovering from the disruptive experience of sexual abuse. For a child who has experienced this trauma, the healing journey is crucial to each child living an emotionally, mentally, and physically healthy life.  A healing garden at the Children’s Advocacy Center of Kent County will be a key piece of that journey.</p>

With five autoimmune diseases between us, we found our path to better health and stronger community through the Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) and now it is our mission to share this approach. (If you would like to learn exactly what the AIP is, you can find a comprehensive guide here.)In addition to writing books, creating tools, supporting individuals in our private practices, and teaching other practitioners how to use AIP, one of the ways we work to share this approach is through advocating for and participating in the medical research process.

It can be used an unlimited number of times, contributing towards reducing the waste of water. It has a greater thermal inertia, meaning it stays warm or cold for a longer period compared to conventional fillings. It is also cleaner, easier and safer to use, being FDA/CE certified.

 

Heat reduces stress and tension throughout the body, as it increases the blood circulation keeping the muscles functioning properly and providing them with more oxygen and nutrients. Hugs, even short ones, immediately release oxytocin, a hormone associated with happiness and stress relief.
When heat and hugs are combined, both body and mind experience a sense of wellbeing that contributes to better long-term health and balance.
 

During the last months we have been intensely looking for the best materials, textures and combinations to design the beautiful yet functional product that we could not find in the market.

 

Heatbag will be ready for delivery the first two weeks of December, perfect timing for an original (and huggable) gift!
Surely you know someone who's always in need of an extra boost of heat, or who could use a warm companion to relieve the pains and strains of contemporary lifestyle. There is no better gift than taking care of your loved ones!

<p><strong>Plus-Friends is the first social network to provide social interaction, education, and entertainment for all men and women over the age of 18.</strong></p>
<p>Our Plus-Friends platform makes it possible to explore life in an environment that is supportive of HIV positive lifestyles.</p>
<p>And Plus-Friends extends the opportunities for everyone living with HIV to communicate on a global basis. We are doing so by providing a safe, confidential, and optimistic atmosphere in which to meet other HIV-positive friends.</p>
<p>Plus-Friends provides a place to share opinions and experiences so that members can make better decisions. In addition, it allows the community to discuss mental health issues, aging with HIV, establish groups with shared interests, set up events, or just hang out.</p>
<p>Our members can explore what they love without fear of rejection, whether it is a love of art or architecture, music or film, pets or people, photography or painting, cooking or dining out, indoor or outdoor activities, and so much more. The opportunities are limitless.</p>
<p>Everything we do at Plus-Friends is about bringing people together and empowering them to be themselves. and to live a more fulfilling and healthy life. We take away the awkwardness of having to conform to the ideas and misconceptions of what it means to have HIV.</p>
<p>We celebrate the unique gifts that each person brings to Plus-Friends and recognize that everyone brings a valuable contribution to this world. We believe in everyone’s right to celebrate life and live well, connect with new people, be supported by friends, and perhaps even discover love.</p>
<p>Our goal is to provide a global community that provides a caring, non-judgmental environment that empowers people to get what everyone wants and deserves in life -- connection, love and support.</p>

<p><strong>You are opening doors to a more joyful life, better mental health, engaged learning, social interaction, and life-long friendships. Your donations to Plus-Friends add a new dimension to the lives of those living with HIV.</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to your donations, Plus-Friends can effectively reach out to people with HIV who need the support and mentoring of others. Many of our members have been through the trauma of discovering they are HIV-positive, are in treatment and have their viral load suppressed.</p>
<p>Connecting people with HIV to one another allows them to develop friendships without the embarrassment of revealing their status to others. </p>
<p>Plus-Friends removes the social stigma from HIV within the group and provides a much-needed platform to share knowledge, experiences, provide support, and recommendations.</p>

<p><strong>Our goals are simple but will make a huge impact in the world:</strong></p>
<p>Connect all people with HIV that have access to the internet and a mobile device or computer.</p>
<p>Provide mental health or group support for those who need it.</p>
<p>Bring attention to the issues surrounding aging.</p>
<p>Provide a supportive community for women and a secondary community for mothers living with HIV.</p>
<p>Help those living in isolation by giving them a sense of community.</p>
<p>Plus-Friends is not a medical or organizational site. We have chosen to be a social network to help bring life-affirming activities and friendships to those who are HIV-positive and therefore in need of a community. Our focus is not about being ill -- it is about living well and sharing common interests with friends around the world.</p>
<p><strong>Why is it important </strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580383073/x0vmlgpgnx9mjhhkyooj.jpg"" src=""""/><strong>Today, thanks to the tremendous advances with medications, people with HIV can expect to live a full life well into their 70s. This is wonderful news, but it also presents some unexpected challenges.</strong></p>
<p>Not so long ago people with HIV did not expect to live a long life nor did they expect to be able to live a normal life such as getting married and having children. Science has made all of this possible. Now life for the HIV community has most of the same expectations of normal life – family, retirement, and goals. This places much more importance on protecting health, fitness, retirement planning, insurance, dating and romance, and all of the same interests that are common in a non-HIV population.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580383116/osxdiadfz78wfjosodyo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>If Treatment Works, then What is the Problem Now?</strong><br/>In 2018, 1.7 million people became newly infected with HIV. This represents a decline in annual new infections of 18% since 2010, a pace that was far too slow to reach the United Nations’ Fast-Track Target of fewer than 500,000 new infections per year by 2020. Therefore, we must find other ways to improve the quality of life for those living with HIV such as reducing isolation, providing for the elderly, and assisting women.</p>
<p>It is vital to remember that HIV is a medical condition, and therefore, in most countries, is protected by privacy laws. Even though Facebook provides groups for HIV, this forum is a public social network, not a private network. As a result, it is open to everyone and does not accommodate the privacy that people seek and require for this condition.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580383142/swf5rnbycvdxytnsdy0t.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>A Close Look at Public Social Networks</strong><br/>While there are closed groups on Facebook, there is a systemic problem with the sharing of information on Facebook that makes many with HIV fearful of participating. Facebook, as you probably know, is under many investigations for breach of privacy and sharing of data. While Plus-Friends will use social media as a way of drawing in new members to have a look at our private social network, we are a completely different platform from Facebook. We have HIV and security as a primary focus for our membership.</p>
<p>In addition, Facebook and other public networks are often a platform for attacks from haters. Plus-Friends provides a place where people can feel comfortable being themselves without the fear of rejection or public humiliation. Our zero-tolerance policy allows us to address issues that might arise and are enforceable by the very fact that we are not a public network.</p>

<p><strong>Why is Isolation and Depression an Issue that Needs to be Addressed?</strong><br/>HIV-infected people have a hard time finding and meeting others like themselves because HIV is shrouded with silence. As a result, these individuals often live in isolation. Plus-Friends will help educate and provide a normal life for people living in the shadows by focusing on living and not on the medical condition.</p>
<p>Plus-Friends also has a public-facing frontend that helps educate all people and encourages the understanding and acceptance of this medical condition. People with HIV want a place to discuss the subject, treatments, learn about new ideas and medical options, discuss medical results, anxiety and other mental health issues without fear of being ostracized. They also desire an opportunity not to have their condition overshadow life and community.</p>

<p><strong>Special Groups for Special People</strong><br/>More than half of the people with HIV that are over the age of 18 are female, and these women have no private area to discuss issues of concern that are unique to women. There are no exact numbers to let us know how many of these women are mothers currently raising children. However, it is clear that there are immeasurable difficulties encountered by these families each day that have no outlet for answers. The same can be said for single fathers with HIV.</p>
<p>Groups are a special focus for Plus-Friends. We recognize that shared interests bring people together around the world. Our goal is to provide a platform that allows individuals to start their own groups dedicated to things they love – from crafting to cooking, coffee to wine, gardening to shopping, and running to dancing. Whatever floats your boat – including boats!</p>

<p><strong>Why Privacy Matters</strong><br/>For people living with HIV, perhaps more than any other physical condition, privacy is critical. For example, in some countries a person could lose their job if they have HIV. Or their HIV condition could cause the group insurance rates at their place of employment to go up. Having HIV could cause harm to the individual in some locations in the world, and could even cause harm to their families.</p>
<p>In any case, HIV is a very private medical condition that should only be shared by choice of the individual who is living with it.</p>
<p>Another critical goal of Plus-Friends is to keep the lives of people with HIV private so that people in all nations can benefit from this network, including those in countries where being gay or HIV positive can lead to arrest, victimization, and even death.</p>
<p>A Plus-Friends Foundation to Give Back<br/>In addition to its social network, Plus-Friends establishes a foundation that will benefit from a percentage of its sponsorship. This will be used to fund important projects for HIV/AIDS charities that are members of Plus-Friends and have applied through the appropriate channels.</p>

<h3>What are we doing here?</h3>
<p>1 hour (or 60 minutes) of floating is equivalent to 4 hours of deep sleep.  With just that one line of information, we KNOW there isn’t one person who would not benefit from floating.  But just in case you're still not sold, we'll keep going.</p>
<p>The struggle is real!</p>
<p>People are becoming addicted to prescription medications at an astounding rate.  Statistics show about 7 million Americans are abusing them, which is an 80 percent increase within the last decade. It's an epidemic!  What if we told you there is a simple, yet effective way to reduce and possibly eliminate the use of prescribed and OTC medications.</p>
<p>We all struggle or know others that struggle with sleep deprivation, anxiety, and stress from work, school and/or family life, depression, PTSD, headaches, migraines and hypertension,  physical pains within the body, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease…the list goes on!  If you or anyone you know has previously dealt with or are currently dealing with any physical/mental ongoing pain or even just temporary discomfort, and think to yourselves “I have tried EVERYTHING!”  yet you continue to suffer, we ask – have you ever tried floating?</p>
<p>Hi, I’m Alexis and I’m Ann.  We are the owners of Dakota Float Center and if you’ve made it this far, we want to explain what floating is, and how it benefits everyone. </p>
<p>Floating takes place in a giant “pod” filled with 12 to 15 inches of water, warmed to body temperature and over 1000lbs of Epsom salt making it the cleanest commercial water you will ever find.  The water in a float pod has a relative density of about 1.25, making it essentially impossible not to float, creating an almost zero gravity environment.  Floating allows your mind and body to become so relaxed that you enter what it called the “Theta” state - which is a deep meditation or rest.  Many float for meditation alone. </p>
<p>The benefits of Floating are scientifically proven to promote physical and mental recovery, diminish depression, anxiety, fatigue and jet leg.   Floating alleviates stress, symptoms of PTSD, and relieving pain from arthritis and the body.  It also improves mental clarity and alertness, as well as athletic performance and helping to prevent sports injuries.</p>

<p>RESEARCH INTO FLOAT THERAPY AND ADDICTIONS</p>
<p>A lot of research has been conducted over the years to determine the effectiveness of flotation rooms in treating addictive disorders. The use of float rooms has increased in recent years as the knowledge and understanding of the underlying processes to addictions has grown.</p>
<p>In his book “The Book of Floating”, Michael Hutchinson shares that</p>
<p>“…both behavioural/cognitive psychologists and neuroscientists now agree that the floatation tank is a powerful tool for overcoming addictions, both by changing addictive behaviour and personality characteristics, and by bringing about rapid and striking changes in human biochemistry”.</p>

</div></div>","What are we doing here?
1 hour (or 60 minutes) of floating is equivalent to 4 hours of deep sleep.  With just that one line of information, we KNOW there isn’t one person who would not benefit from floating.  But just in case you're still not sold, we'll keep going.
The struggle is real!
People are becoming addicted to prescription medications at an astounding rate.  Statistics show about 7 million Americans are abusing them, which is an 80 percent increase within the last decade. It's an epidemic!  What if we told you there is a simple, yet effective way to reduce and possibly eliminate the use of prescribed and OTC medications.
We all struggle or know others that struggle with sleep deprivation, anxiety, and stress from work, school and/or family life, depression, PTSD, headaches, migraines and hypertension,  physical pains within the body, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease…the list goes on!  If you or anyone you know has previously dealt with or are currently dealing with any physical/mental ongoing pain or even just temporary discomfort, and think to yourselves “I have tried EVERYTHING!”  yet you continue to suffer, we ask – have you ever tried floating?
Hi, I’m Alexis and I’m Ann.  We are the owners of Dakota Float Center and if you’ve made it this far, we want to explain what floating is, and how it benefits everyone. 
Floating takes place in a giant “pod” filled with 12 to 15 inches of water, warmed to body temperature and over 1000lbs of Epsom salt making it the cleanest commercial water you will ever find.  The water in a float pod has a relative density of about 1.25, making it essentially impossible not to float, creating an almost zero gravity environment.  Floating allows your mind and body to become so relaxed that you enter what it called the “Theta” state - which is a deep meditation or rest.  Many float for meditation alone. 
The benefits of Floating are scientifically proven to promote physical and mental recovery, diminish depression, anxiety, fatigue and jet leg.   Floating alleviates stress, symptoms of PTSD, and relieving pain from arthritis and the body.  It also improves mental clarity and alertness, as well as athletic performance and helping to prevent sports injuries.

<p>My name is Yulimar Z. Cruz and I am a personal trainer from Puerto Rico. I focus in changing people’s life styles by helping others overcome obstacles, tearing down barriers, breaking limits and achieving a mental state where there are no excuses for realizing  personal goals.  Before all these personal objectives and dreams became reality, In 2011, I was surgically intervened for a mass that was found around my breast area. As a consequence of this procedure I suffered significant nerve damage. I became pretty much completely useless, using lots of medications, without the use of my arm and suffering constant, unbearable pain. I drastically gained weight to 195 pounds from the 135 pounds I weight before the operation, all these in less than one year. In 2013, I made the decision to completely change my life. I began seeking information from people that had gone through similar situations and that had gotten results with a lifestyle and nutrition change.  I went against doctors advice because all those medicines and therapies where not getting any positive results.  I changed my eating habits, began doing physical activities and here I am a new person, without pain and without the use of medicines, feeling better than when I was 21 years old. I became a personal trainer to have the knowledge and tools to change other peoples life’s as I had changed mine.</p>
<p>This year I will have the opportunity to be certified as an instructor in a new training tendency that’s getting more and more attention these days. This training program provides great benefit for the body, including more mobility, flexibility, potential, ability, control and neuromuscular communication.  Besides these benefits for the physical well being it can also help with peoples emotional states, because these natural movements stimulate relaxation and are able to significally reduce stress levels and anxiety in very noticeable ways helping others achieve a better quality of life.  </p>
<p>With your contributions I will be traveling to Spain around the middle of November to take part in the Animal Flow Certification 1 Intensive Course.  These funds will be used to cover the course fee, airline tickets, hotel, transportation and other miscellaneous expenditures.    </p>

<p><i><strong>Campaign </strong></i></p>
<p>Imagine a world where all women and girls are free from shame, oppression and abuse, able to live in resonance with the power of their natural rhythmic cycles and in connection with their inner wisdom.  </p>
<p>We want a world where everybody’s sisters and daughters are safe to pursue their spiritual journeys of reconnection free from abuse.  With your help and the help of a global network of millions of yoginis and yogis, we want to help all women to be aware of how to ensure their safety and sovereignty within the often oppressive and disempowering orthodoxy of yoga environments, and to give women the courage to speak out. We intend to dismantle harmful structures and beliefs that create conditions for the abuse of power in yoga teacher-student dynamics. </p>
<p>This is the central message of Yoni Shakti:  A Woman's Guide to Yoga and Freedom through Yoga and Tantra and and we're pledging all the funds raised from the launch of the revised and updated edition, available here first, to this movement and public awareness and education campaign.</p>
<p><i>To make this happen we need to spread the word, to educate yoga practitioners, teachers, teacher trainers and studio owners around the globe. We need your help to do that.</i></p>
<p><i><strong>Background</strong></i></p>
<p>Yoni Shakti: A Woman’s Guide to Power and Freedom through Yoga and Tantra was published in 2014. A key section of the first edition was removed prior to printing because author Uma Dinsmore-Tuli’s hard-hitting description of the contemporary Yoga Industrial Complex as a ‘stinking palace floating on a lagoon filled with corpses and shit’ was considered too offensive to publish at that time. </p>
<p>Sadly, Uma’s censored prediction in that first edition has now been recognised widely to be the truth. The past few years have seen innumerable revelations and investigations of sexual, financial, physical and emotional abuses committed by teachers under the guise of ‘yoga’. There is now hardly a single ashram, school or yoga institution that has not been exposed to be harbouring these harms. The abusive power dynamics common to many individual yoga teachers and gurus have also been reported by brave women who have spoken up, and Uma Dinsmore-Tuli, like lots of other women in yoga, has now heard too many of these stories to keep quiet any longer. She is now fully committed to sharing the evidence presented to her, including the names of teachers and places that she wouldn’t want anybody’s sisters or daughters to go to. Her intention with this campaign is to educate yoga practitioners, teachers and yoga teacher trainers worldwide to call out existing harm and to prevent future abuses of power.</p>
<p>The uncensored and revised new edition of Yoni Shakti includes a practical checklist of warning signals to protect women in yoga, and a new Warning Prologue sharing a number of powerful statements in verse and prose. It also presents a comprehensive list of organisations and individuals that have harmed women and girls under the guise of the spiritual teachings of yoga. Yoni Shakti Updated and Uncensored is available online from May 2020.</p>
<p><i><strong>About Uma</strong></i></p>
<p>Uma Dinsmore-Tuli PhD is a writer, visionary, radical yogini, eco-feminist activist and Total Yoga Nidra advocate. Practicing yoga since the age of four, and teaching since 1994, Uma is a yoga therapist certified by the International Association of Yoga Therapists (CIAYT), with special expertise in yoga therapy for women’s health. She is a mother of three, and has written four books on yoga, including the massive and highly influential Yoni Shakti. </p>
<p><strong><i>About Team Yoni Shakti</i></strong></p>
<p>This campaign is run by a committed team of women who are passionately, personally and professionally invested in the goals of the movement.  This team is Uma Dinsmore-Tuli PhD (Founder), Sophie-Jane Mortimer (Campaign Consultant),  Cecilia Allon (Campaign Manager) and Jessica Healy (Campaign Social Media Manager).  This team is supported by an extraordinary global web of allies, yoga teacher trainers, teachers and practitioners.  We are working as an open network, through heartfelt connection, trust and love without a formal hierarchy.  </p>
<p><i><strong>Why we need YOUR help</strong></i></p>
<p>The updated and revised new edition of Yoni Shakti includes a comprehensive, practical checklist of 13 Warning Signals that, both protect the safety and sovereignty of women, and empower sisters to spot the potentials for harm within the often oppressive and disempowering orthodoxy of yoga environments.  Also outlined are nine practical, simple and direct Calls to Action that can be taken when abuse is revealed.</p>
<p><i>Through this campaign, we aim to empower, educate, and resource the Yoni Shakti network of 1000's of women to share the 'Empowerment Kit' of the Womb Yoga Manifesto, the Thirteen Warning Signals of Abuse, the Nine Calls to Action.  Our intention is to reach 1008 yoga teachers, teacher trainings and studios around the globe.  <strong>We need YOU to help us reach this goal.</strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong>What your contribution will fund</strong></i></p>
</div><div>
<p>This is what we project the crowd-funding and public awareness campaign will cost for one year. Any funds we raise above and beyond will go to fund further public outreach and campaigning.

In this moment under lockdown, when attention turns within, we are gifted an opportunity to search deep within the shadows of the inner world to discover the values that support us and to meet and heal the harms we have encountered. During this time of challenge, many previous traumas and difficulties resurface, and in seeking to make peace with ourselves we turn for comfort and healing to our heartfelt connection with each other and the earth.
This is the moment to reconnect with our deepest wisdom, and to stand in solidarity, support and connection for all those who seek to live in freedom ...

Campaign 
Imagine a world where all women and girls are free from shame, oppression and abuse, able to live in resonance with the power of their natural rhythmic cycles and in connection with their inner wisdom.  
We want a world where everybody’s sisters and daughters are safe to pursue their spiritual journeys of reconnection free from abuse.  With your help and the help of a global network of millions of yoginis and yogis, we want to help all women to be aware of how to ensure their safety and sovereignty within the often oppressive and disempowering orthodoxy of yoga environments, and to give women the courage to speak out. We intend to dismantle harmful structures and beliefs that create conditions for the abuse of power in yoga teacher-student dynamics. 
This is the central message of Yoni Shakti:  A Woman's Guide to Yoga and Freedom through Yoga and Tantra and and we're pledging all the funds raised from the launch of the revised and updated edition, available here first, to this movement and public awareness and education campaign.
To make this happen we need to spread the word, to educate yoga practitioners, teachers, teacher trainers and studio owners around the globe. We need your help to do that.
Background
Yoni Shakti: A Woman’s Guide to Power and Freedom through Yoga and Tantra was published in 2014. A key section of the first edition was removed prior to printing because author Uma Dinsmore-Tuli’s hard-hitting description of the contemporary Yoga Industrial Complex as a ‘stinking palace floating on a lagoon filled with corpses and shit’ was considered too offensive to publish at that time. 
Sadly, Uma’s censored prediction in that first edition has now been recognised widely to be the truth. The past few years have seen innumerable revelations and investigations of sexual, financial, physical and emotional abuses committed by teachers under the guise of ‘yoga’. There is now hardly a single ashram, school or yoga institution that has not been exposed to be harbouring these harms. The abusive power dynamics common to many individual yoga teachers and gurus have also been reported by brave women who have spoken up, and Uma Dinsmore-Tuli, like lots of other women in yoga, has now heard too many of these stories to keep quiet any longer. She is now fully committed to sharing the evidence presented to her, including the names of teachers and places that she wouldn’t want anybody’s sisters or daughters to go to. Her intention with this campaign is to educate yoga practitioners, teachers and yoga teacher trainers worldwide to call out existing harm and to prevent future abuses of power.
The uncensored and revised new edition of Yoni Shakti includes a practical checklist of warning signals to protect women in yoga, and a new Warning Prologue sharing a number of powerful statements in verse and prose. It also presents a comprehensive list of organisations and individuals that have harmed women and girls under the guise of the spiritual teachings of yoga. Yoni Shakti Updated and Uncensored is available online from May 2020.
About Uma
Uma Dinsmore-Tuli PhD is a writer, visionary, radical yogini, eco-feminist activist and Total Yoga Nidra advocate. Practicing yoga since the age of four, and teaching since 1994, Uma is a yoga therapist certified by the International Association of Yoga Therapists (CIAYT), with special expertise in yoga therapy for women’s health. She is a mother of three, and has written four books on yoga, including the massive and highly influential Yoni Shakti. 
About Team Yoni Shakti
This campaign is run by a committed team of women who are passionately, personally and professionally invested in the goals of the movement.  This team is Uma Dinsmore-Tuli PhD (Founder), Sophie-Jane Mortimer (Campaign Consultant),  Cecilia Allon (Campaign Manager) and Jessica Healy (Campaign Social Media Manager).  This team is supported by an extraordinary global web of allies, yoga teacher trainers, teachers and practitioners.  We are working as an open network, through heartfelt connection, trust and love without a formal hierarchy.  
Why we need YOUR help
The updated and revised new edition of Yoni Shakti includes a comprehensive, practical checklist of 13 Warning Signals that, both protect the safety and sovereignty of women, and empower sisters to spot the potentials for harm within the often oppressive and disempowering orthodoxy of yoga environments.  Also outlined are nine practical, simple and direct Calls to Action that can be taken when abuse is revealed.
Through this campaign, we aim to empower, educate, and resource the Yoni Shakti network of 1000's of women to share the 'Empowerment Kit' of the Womb Yoga Manifesto, the Thirteen Warning Signals of Abuse, the Nine Calls to Action.  Our intention is to reach 1008 yoga teachers, teacher trainings and studios around the globe.  We need YOU to help us reach this goal.
What your contribution will fund

This is what we project the crowd-funding and public awareness campaign will cost for one year. Any funds we raise above and beyond will go to fund further public outreach and campaigning. We will track our progress and give you monthly updates about the success of the public awareness campaign.

<h3>La Ermita - a community space that matters</h3>
<p>In July of 2001, I quit my job as a hospital based speech-pathologist to open up my own community wellness center, borrowing $6000 from my parents to launch this venture. I developed and published my own unique ""radical inclusion"" centered therapy approach and immediately put it into practice, initially focusing on kids with autism spectrum disorders, adults with stroke and other traumatic brain injuries and teen agers who were struggling with depression and anxiety. <br/><br/>In the fifteen years that followed, I successfully started over <a href=""https://youtu.be/j0F0qFRwpDY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">25 different all volunteer outreach programs</a>, was the first non-profit yoga and wellness center in the Pacific Northwest, was the first social justice based yoga organization with a mission of radical inclusion and never sending anyone away for lack of funds, and the first yoga center in the area to focus on <a href=""https://mollylannonkenny.org/press-coverage/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">truly accessible yoga, for all bodies, for all minds</a>. </p>
<p>In 2015, with the market saturated in Seattle and the cost of living more than I could sustain running the non-profit, I took the leap to move to the small rural community in Mexico where I had already been planting roots for almost ten years. <br/><br/>When I arrived in the town in early 2006, I began to ask folks what support they needed for things like depression and anxiety. At that time, as I was still an outsider, I was met with lots of ""we don't get depressed here,"" or ""that's an American thing to worry about."" But as I continued to cultivate my ties to the community, learning to speak fluent Spanish, beginning to teach English and offer small groups for mindfulness and movement, the community response began to shift. Pretty soon I had lots of people, and particularly women, asking me if I could help them with various physical ailments. But every single time, when they entered into the tiny backyard studio I had built, they immediately began to cry and talk about things like domestic violence, feeling trapped and isolated, alcoholism, the stressors of poverty, and yes, depression and anxiety, <br/><br/>I kept my reach small for many years, wanting to ensure that I had the right reputation with the community, that I understood - as well as an outsider could - their particular concerns and struggles, and that if I built something bigger it would be embraced and utilized and not seen as simply a ""gringo"" thing. I continued offering free one on one sessions, and expanded to offering twice weekly free mindfulness groups. I started offering free Bedside Yoga sessions in people's homes to help alleviate suffering and isolation associated with chronic pain - most people here not even able to afford over the counter pain medications. <br/><br/>After my sister died in October of 2019, I earned a small but significant sum of money for being the executor of her estate. Erin was always so encouraging and proud of everything I did, and in particular admired my capacity and passion for reaching the most vulnerable among us. It only made sense to me then, to invest all of the money I earned from her estate into this place that would also honor her. <br/><br/>Last year, finally having a bit of start up funding, a secure ground and, more than anything, watching the rapid growth and gentrification of the town, with the most marginalized of the community being further pushed to the margins, I knew I had to do something, especially before someone else did - putting in a ""yoga studio"" or some other space that would feel inaccessible to my local friends. <br/> </p>

With this part of the project completed, I will be able to open this healing space to the local community at no charge. I will be able to offer workshops, classes and retreats to visitors at a fair price that will help to sustain the work we will do here together.<br/><br/>Once the ground floor is fully established, I hope to be able to build a second floor that will include a small two bedroom apartment and a therapy room which will then create a 100% self-sustaining model so that I will be able to grow my reach and programs to support the community. <br/> </li>

<li>If I do not reach my entire goal, I will continue to build little by little, investing all of my income over the next several years to see the project through to completion. In the meanwhile, I will use the main hall to offer individual therapy, group classes, arts opportunities, mindfulness and meditation groups, and weekly faith services to my local community. I will also use it to offer once monthly ""free"" thrift shops - asking tourists and ""snowbirds"" to donate unused or unwanted items to a centralized location for folks who are struggling financially to be able to get simple household items such as towels, sheets, dishes, clothing, books, tools and toys. </li>

<h3>
<br/>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>I have worked in community organizing and outreach and the healing arts, including clinical therapy for all of my professional life. I have a proven track record of making things happen. As I settle into my second half of life, I am becoming increasingly interested in small, personal impact over large programs.<br/><br/>La Ermita is just that. We will offer free therapy and classes, as well as volunteer programs for people who are home-bound with critical or terminal illnesses and end of life care. We will provide a safe space for women of the community to gather and share and to know their own worth. We will offer a transformative, curative space which will allow people who otherwise don't have the means to even leave the pueblo to be able to experience a feeling of being transported beyond the limitations of poverty and lack of access. We will offer a space where kids can come and learn tools for self-regulation and valuing of self. We will replicate the experience of The Samarya Center, where all people feel invited, welcomed and celebrated. <br/><br/>The best part is that you, as a donor, can come here and see it and experience it for yourself, and know that you helped to create this and see with your own eyes the changes you have made in the lives of people who desperately need these opportunities. <br/> </li>
<li>I have done this before and I can do it again. Please look at my press, the videos about what we accomplished at Samarya, and the short documentaries about the community we built together in Seattle. I have the experience, I have the passion, I have the capacity and I have a solid start.  Now I just need the funds. <br/><br/>Please help to make La Ermita a reality. </li>

As I settle into my second half of life, I am becoming increasingly interested in small, personal impact over large programs.La Ermita is just that. We will offer free therapy and classes, as well as volunteer programs for people who are home-bound with critical or terminal illnesses and end of life care. We will provide a safe space for women of the community to gather and share and to know their own worth. We will offer a transformative, curative space which will allow people who otherwise don't have the means to even leave the pueblo to be able to experience a feeling of being transported beyond the limitations of poverty and lack of access. We will offer a space where kids can come and learn tools for self-regulation and valuing of self. We will replicate the experience of The Samarya Center, where all people feel invited, welcomed and celebrated. The best part is that you, as a donor, can come here and see it and experience it for yourself, and know that you helped to create this and see with your own eyes the changes you have made in the lives of people who desperately need these opportunities.  
I have done this before and I can do it again. Please look at my press, the videos about what we accomplished at Samarya, and the short documentaries about the community we built together in Seattle. I have the experience, I have the passion, I have the capacity and I have a solid start.  Now I just need the funds. Please help to make La Ermita a reality.",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are five students from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, who have come together through our public writing course to team up with Second Harvest Food Bank of East Tennessee in order to raise $1,000 in donations that will support Second Harvest, a non profit organization, and ultimately bring awareness to hunger in our community. Food insecurity is a prevalent issue in Tennessee, especially for children, with one in six child struggling with hunger.</p>
<p>Second Harvest Food Bank is East Tennessee’s largest hunger relief organization and fights to end hunger in our community. Second Harvest distributes food in 18 counties across East Tennessee and annually distributes more than 21 million pounds of food and grocery products. Due to the devastating effects of Covid-19, the work Second Harvest does is important now more than ever. Second Harvest is in a great need of essential resources to aid our community. Our goal is to raise funds so Second Harvest can continue the great work they do in East Tennessee and combat the problem of hunger during this pandemic.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise $1,000 in donations that will directly support Second Harvest, a non profit organization, and ultimately bring awareness to hunger in our community. We strive to be a group with integrity and want to secure your trust in our campaign. By choosing a reliable platform, such as Indiegogo, we can safely assure you that 100% of your donation will go directly to Second Harvest Food Bank of East Tennessee. </p>
<p>While fundraising for our campaign will help support the work that Second Harvest does, it will also help make it possible for citizens all over East Tennessee, of all ages, to have a meal that they wouldn’t have been able to get. As a way of thanking our donors, our group has reached out to SunSport Restaurant (Knoxville, TN) and received a yummy list of perks! Some examples of our perks include dining at Stefano's Pizza for only $10, one free chips and queso at SunSpot Restaurant, and one entree 50% off when you buy one entree at SunSpot Restaurant!</p>
<p>We hope we can reach our goal of $1,000, but there is always the chance that we won't. In this scenario, how ever much money we have raised in donations will still directly go to Second Harvest Food Bank. No matter if we are under our goal or over our goal, any amount of donations is extremely appreciated during these trying times and will have a positive impact on our community.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Did you know in 2017, Second Harvest served 181,758 people in East Tennessee alone? Imagine how many people they are serving now during this pandemic!  </p>
<p>As a result of Covid-19, food pantries, including Second Harvest, are serving record numbers of families. In order to keep up with the demand, monetary donations are important now more than ever. “Take a Bite out of Hunger” strives to raise funds for Second Harvest so they can continue with their programs, such as senior outreach or filling school pantries. We want to help those who don’t know when their next meal will be. Through our campaign, you can help us solve this problem in East Tennessee.</p>
<p>While fundraising for our campaign will help support the work that Second Harvest does, it will also help make it possible for citizens all over East Tennessee, of all ages, to have a meal that they wouldn’t have been able to get. For every $1 donated, Second Harvest produces 3 meals! That means if we reach our goal of $1,000, 3,000 meals will be served! Wouldn't you want to be apart of something life changing?</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>It is important to note that in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, there are some risks associated with volunteer work and other aspects of the “Take a Bite out of Hunger” campaign. Volunteer work should be done while maintaining proper social distance of 6 feet. Masks should be worn at all times while interacting with other volunteers. If you feel sick or feel you have been potentially exposed to someone with Covid-19, you should choose to stay home. Our group is making sure that during our campaign process, we abide by University and Knox County health policies. This includes making sure we are healthy, socially distanced, and wearing a mask while working with Second Harvest. We also would like to ensure that all donations go directly to Second Harvest Food Bank, and that our donation platform, Indiegogo, is a reliable, trustworthy platform. We strive to be a group with integrity and want to secure your trust in our campaign. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>While “Take a Bite out of Hunger” is doing as much as we can to assist Second Harvest during these trying times, there is always more that can be done. There are multiple other ways you can help. Second Harvest is always taking monetary donations. When you visit Secondharvestetn.org, there is a place to donate. The website walks you through the steps to process your donations directly through Second Harvest’s website, in aid to their Covid-19 relief. Information about their donor privacy policy can also be found on their website.</p>
<p>Second Harvest’s website also provides those looking to help with a tab titled “Act”. This tab provides information about different ways the community can get involved and assist with Second Harvest’s mission. The “Act” tab provides insight about how to initiate involvement through advocating, donating, volunteering, and even attending an event hosted by Second Harvest. During times like these, we understand that monetary donations are not always possible, and we appreciate any form of help, whether you donate, volunteer or simply become an advocate for Second Harvest. </p>

We have a goal in mind to raise $1,000 for the Volunteer Ministry Center to contribute to ending homelessness forever. Everyone in our group of 5 has a soft spot for the homeless people in need, and we believe helping the homeless will benefit everyone.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What Exactly is the Volunteer Ministry Center?   </strong></p><p>Many homeless shelters help the homeless people by giving them free handouts, but oftentimes this creates a cycle where the homeless people do not want to change. There is a common misconception that all homeless people are lazy and do not care about contributing to society. This simply is not always true. The Volunteer Ministry Center takes a different approach to help the homeless. They help them to get back on their feet and be functioning members of society again. They provide permanent supportive housing, dental care, emergency shelter, and many other things for the homeless. The Volunteer Ministry Center helps the people that are genuinely seeking positive lifestyle changes, and in return, that benefits everyone in the community. It is also essential to keep in mind the Volunteer Ministry Center does not give free handouts. The people being helped have to put forth the effort as well. This is part of the process of turning lives in a positive direction.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1602177942/l4ko1zlnkvuxrwyb4kpc.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>Homelessness in Knoxville</strong></p><p>There are over 9,000 people that access homeless services every year in the greater Knoxville area (""Volunteer Ministry Center""). This does not count the people who need help that do not seek it. On a more prominent note, “around 7,467 people in Tennessee experience homelessness every day” (United States Interagency Council on Homelessness). All of these people could be retired veterans, college students, high school students, or even younger children. Remember, homelessness can be caused by a variety of things. Some of these people genuinely need help. We, along with the Volunteer Ministry Center, want to give these people another chance so they can become part of our community once again. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1602179023/pruvjzvjhix9w2yjrlyi.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1602179070/puizrvaz3avojq8gjwbw.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>What People Get Wrong About the Homeless</strong></p><p>There are many misconceptions about homeless people. Not all of them fall under the stereotypical labels that we associate them with. There are many other reasons for people becoming homeless, reasons other than drugs, alcohol, or pure laziness. It is not always the person’s own doing as well. There are other reasons, such as escaping abuse, inability to afford housing, and health issues (“What Causes Homelessness?”). Getting a job will not always solve homelessness, either. Studies done in Los Angeles on over 50,000 people show around 27% of homeless adults worked full or part-time (“5 Things People Get Wrong About Homelessness”). We, along with the Volunteer Ministry Center, want to help everyone in every situation, but nobody receives free handouts. We make sure all donations go to people who genuinely need help and are willing to put forth the effort to make a change. </p><p>Homelessness does not only negatively affect the people who experience it. This problem can affect  property owners of the community as well. An example of this is given in a New York Times article discussing property tax in Manhattan which states, “The city’s Independent Budget Office looked at sales in Manhattan and estimated that in such a situation, a homeowner would get about 24 to 25 percent less for a house or a condominium than for a residence farther from a shelter with no other shelters nearby,” (“How Homeless Shelters Affect Property Values”). Studies show that as the homeless population increases, the value of the property decreases as a result. Homeless people in front of stores also detract customers from going into the stores making the business lose sales and profit. Homelessness is a serious issue both economically and for humanitarian reasons. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Why Donate and What does it go to?</strong></p><p>The donations you send will not just benefit the Volunteer Ministry Center. As stated before, we help the people that need it and who are willing to make a change for the better. Donations help provide things such as permanent housing, dental care, emergency shelter, and assistance for rent.</p><p>One of the emergency shelter programs the Volunteer Ministry Center provides is the Foyer. The Foyer has a low-barrier entry and currently provides up to 40 beds to individuals who are homeless with health risks. The specific area that is targeted is a homeless gathering area under the I-40 overpass and Broadway in Knoxville. Keep in mind, certain expectations must be made to be allowed into the Foyer. Every person inside is held to a high standard of living, and everyone is expected to show respect to one another ("" THE FOYER""). Donations would greatly benefit the Foyer by expanding its arms out to more people in need and providing more beds.   </p><p>Keep in mind all the donations given  provide benefits back to the donor. Helping the homeless benefits the people of the community. Studies show that for every $1 invested in beds for the homeless, $2.70 in net benefits are generated. Also, one bed provided to the homeless can generate, on average, up to $10,800 per year (Providing Housing for Homeless is Cheaper for Society”).  These benefits can slowly add up and trickle down to us, the community, benefits such as potential tax deductions.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1602184895/lgtlj0atnhfok0ivohvm.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>Other Ways to Give Back</strong></p><p>Sending donations is not the only way to help. Anyone can volunteer with the Volunteer Ministry Center.  Although the Volunteer Ministry Center is located in Knoxville, Tennessee, there are many homeless shelters across America sharing the same values. As a team, we are currently helping out the Volunteer Ministry Center, but our goal is much bigger than that.

We have a goal in mind to raise $1,000 for the Volunteer Ministry Center to contribute to ending homelessness forever. Everyone in our group of 5 has a soft spot for the homeless people in need, and we believe helping the homeless will benefit everyone. What Exactly is the Volunteer Ministry Center?   Many homeless shelters help the homeless people by giving them free handouts, but oftentimes this creates a cycle where the homeless people do not want to change. There is a common misconception that all homeless people are lazy and do not care about contributing to society. This simply is not always true. The Volunteer Ministry Center takes a different approach to help the homeless. They help them to get back on their feet and be functioning members of society again. They provide permanent supportive housing, dental care, emergency shelter, and many other things for the homeless. The Volunteer Ministry Center helps the people that are genuinely seeking positive lifestyle changes, and in return, that benefits everyone in the community. It is also essential to keep in mind the Volunteer Ministry Center does not give free handouts. The people being helped have to put forth the effort as well. This is part of the process of turning lives in a positive direction.  Homelessness in KnoxvilleThere are over 9,000 people that access homeless services every year in the greater Knoxville area (""Volunteer Ministry Center""). This does not count the people who need help that do not seek it. On a more prominent note, “around 7,467 people in Tennessee experience homelessness every day” (United States Interagency Council on Homelessness). All of these people could be retired veterans, college students, high school students, or even younger children. Remember, homelessness can be caused by a variety of things. Some of these people genuinely need help. We, along with the Volunteer Ministry Center, want to give these people another chance so they can become part of our community once again.  What People Get Wrong About the HomelessThere are many misconceptions about homeless people. Not all of them fall under the stereotypical labels that we associate them with. There are many other reasons for people becoming homeless, reasons other than drugs, alcohol, or pure laziness. It is not always the person’s own doing as well. There are other reasons, such as escaping abuse, inability to afford housing, and health issues (“What Causes Homelessness?”). Getting a job will not always solve homelessness, either. Studies done in Los Angeles on over 50,000 people show around 27% of homeless adults worked full or part-time (“5 Things People Get Wrong About Homelessness”). We, along with the Volunteer Ministry Center, want to help everyone in every situation, but nobody receives free handouts. We make sure all donations go to people who genuinely need help and are willing to put forth the effort to make a change. Homelessness does not only negatively affect the people who experience it. This problem can affect  property owners of the community as well. An example of this is given in a New York Times article discussing property tax in Manhattan which states, “The city’s Independent Budget Office looked at sales in Manhattan and estimated that in such a situation, a homeowner would get about 24 to 25 percent less for a house or a condominium than for a residence farther from a shelter with no other shelters nearby,” (“How Homeless Shelters Affect Property Values”). Studies show that as the homeless population increases, the value of the property decreases as a result. Homeless people in front of stores also detract customers from going into the stores making the business lose sales and profit. Homelessness is a serious issue both economically and for humanitarian reasons.  Why Donate and What does it go to?The donations you send will not just benefit the Volunteer Ministry Center. As stated before, we help the people that need it and who are willing to make a change for the better. Donations help provide things such as permanent housing, dental care, emergency shelter, and assistance for rent.One of the emergency shelter programs the Volunteer Ministry Center provides is the Foyer. The Foyer has a low-barrier entry and currently provides up to 40 beds to individuals who are homeless with health risks. The specific area that is targeted is a homeless gathering area under the I-40 overpass and Broadway in Knoxville. Keep in mind, certain expectations must be made to be allowed into the Foyer. Every person inside is held to a high standard of living, and everyone is expected to show respect to one another ("" THE FOYER""). Donations would greatly benefit the Foyer by expanding its arms out to more people in need and providing more beds.   Keep in mind all the donations given  provide benefits back to the donor. Helping the homeless benefits the people of the community. Studies show that for every $1 invested in beds for the homeless, $2.70 in net benefits are generated. Also, one bed provided to the homeless can generate, on average, up to $10,800 per year (Providing Housing for Homeless is Cheaper for Society”).  These benefits can slowly add up and trickle down to us, the community, benefits such as potential tax deductions. Other Ways to Give BackSending donations is not the only way to help. Anyone can volunteer with the Volunteer Ministry Center.  Although the Volunteer Ministry Center is located in Knoxville, Tennessee, there are many homeless shelters across America sharing the same values. As a team, we are currently helping out the Volunteer Ministry Center, but our goal is much bigger than that. We are trying to spread awareness, inspire others, and help out the homeless all across America. Spreading the word is also another way to help and is just as important as the donations. We need to get our campaign out there to as many people as possible, and you are the perfect way to help! Works Cited “Ending and Preventing Homelessness.”  The Volunteer Ministry Center, https://www.vmcinc.org/.“Tennessee Homeless Statistics.”  United States Interagency Council on Homelessness.  Web.

I'm usually a pretty stress filled, actively mind-chattering person. I've used exercise and work to try to lessen my stress and stream line my competing thoughts but my mind is usually crowded and I'm always looking for ways to focus and feel more calmly productive.<br/>During the session I was told to focus on my breath and return to it whenever I felt distracted. Usually this is a bit difficult for me but I found that the sound immediately put my mind into another place, making my usual chatter much quieter much faster. In the 20 minute session I could feel my body and mind deeply relax but also open up. Unlike a massage, I did not want to simply fall asleep. When I came out of the session I felt that my mind was clear and quiet, available for new information or creative projects. I needed about 10 minutes to absorb the feeling and get back to the world. It was like having a power nap mixed with some kind of therapy that didn't require me to to talk. Great! Afterwards I felt refreshed and also ready to work. I think this would be a particularly helpful thing to do right before having to write or organize something, as I felt awake and calmly focused rather than stressed and cluttered. I would definitely like to continue exploring the benefits of Bio-Reiki both in my personal and work habits.</p><p>Zach (audio-engineer)</p><p>Rabiah’s Bio-Reiki session was amazing. I went into the session with quite a considerable amount of stress. I’m in the beginning stages of launching a business, and will be leaving a steady job behind in order to do so. I had never tried Reiki before, but Rabiah explained the process and quickly put me at ease. The ambient music and the heated pad relaxed me almost instantaneously, and the energy therapy swept me away from worry. When the session was over, I felt more relaxed and comfortable in my own skin than I have in quite some time.

<h3>Let me introduce myself...</h3>
<p>   I am a Midwest native and have always had an appreciation for the simple things in life. I love all things health and wellness and took that route in college but throughout my twenties I realized I loved business and thinking outside the box for sales and marketing. I've done everything from personal training to nutritional consulting to cooking for a health food store to medical sales. All of my paths have diverged into this one business which combines all my interests in to one. This was not an overnight idea, I have devoted the last year to consulting with business gurus, mobile vehicle professionals and have worked out the details of this mobile salon and am ready to get this business going. I truly believe that this mobile salon will redefine the way working professionals receive all their salon and wellness needs as well as serve as the premier wedding day essential to make any wedding or special occasion fun and memorable. The ideas are endless and I am so excited to see how we can bring the community the first of its kind. Innovation is scary sometimes but its always worth the risk. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $70, 000 to complete this project. With the interest level I've already received from large businesses I wanted to provide a large enough mobile salon that can host two salon stations, a wash bowl station as well as a sitting area, kitchenette, and room for other vendors that would be a part of Copper Canyon. The class A motor home is our best option but is not a cheap project. We will have the unit completely renovated to ergonomically work. Aside from the equipment and renovation is the umbrella licensing I will need to carry to be able to operate in multiple cities and states as well as the commercial license and insurances. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I want to always give more than I get and I looked through hundreds of products that would be enticing to men and women. The majority of people wear ball caps and they are a stylish accessory that make any outfit look better and if you have a bad hair day just cover it up. Hats are great for sporting events, the pool to block sun, and boating.  Our personalized hats will go to each person who donates $30.</p>
<p>My top priority in this business is quality and I have found an aromatherapy line of products that are clean and smell amazing and include shampoo, conditioner, beard balm or heel balm, muscle rub, and toner. The products will come in a travel bag that you can have two options to choose between and will be your favorite travel bag!</p>
<p>For contributions $700 or more will receive their first choice of dates to have Copper Canyon come to their business, neighborhood, wedding, or event and receive free services for their party for the event and any donations over $1000 will receive services once a month for the year at no charge!  </p>
<p>If we do not receive the full amount of funding we will not touch the money but try and explore a traditional loan to pair it with as well as save for an additional year and launch another campaign. Your money will be invested wisely and I will be stretching every dollar that we raise. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>While it may just seem like a mobile hair salon, this will be so much for the community. I have already dedicated my time to a gala in October of this year called Taste of Compassion hosted by Mother's Refuge, an organization that provides shelter for young pregnant women who need a safe place to land and flourish who do not have the resources they need. With a mobile unit serving would be so much easier and provide a place that I could simply pull up and have everything I need.</p>
<p>Another service based project that I want to utilize Copper Canyon Mobile Salon for is the Veterans Community Project which builds tiny homes to help homeless veterans get back on their feet in a community where they are supported in finding a job and living safely. I will dedicate my time to bringing the business to their community once a month and giving back in a small way to these men and women who have sacrificed so much for my freedom. A basic hair cut, shave, and massage can go a long way for these people when looking for a job and for their self esteem. </p>
<p>Copper Canyon is committed to giving back to the community every way we possibly can!</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

</p><p>I am Reiki Master Willow Le Mechant of
the Temple of the Phoenix in New Orleans, Louisiana. I am an Ordained
Minister, Intuitive Psychic and Medium. I provide Spiritual
Counselling, Clearings, Reiki Classes, Reiki Healings and Officiate Marriages. I have
been an Ordained Minister and Reiki Master for 14 years. I have an AA
in Business from Purdue University and have successfully operated my
own full time spiritual services business in New Orleans, Louisiana
for nearly 4 years. I assist clients who are seeking answers about
life and their spiritual purpose daily. I am assisted by two other
Reiki Masters at the Temple of the Phoenix and soon the Divine Source
Spiritual Center, Reiki Master Spogga Hash and Reiki Master Richard
Valley. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Spogga Hash follows the Buddhist path
and is a very talented and successful musician here in New Orleans.
He has a keen business sense and will be a great asset to our
spiritual center. He will be helping in organizing music events and
continue assisting with our Reiki classes and Healing Circles at the
Divine Source Spiritual Center.

who has been meditating and studying the Dharma for eight years.  He also assists with our Healing
Circles and will be assisting us in organizing many events at the
Divine Source Spiritual Center when we open in August.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
It has been my long time goal to create a Nonprofit spiritual center, a place
of healing and enlightenment, for people of all spiritual paths in my
community. I started the Temple of the Phoenix in my home in
September 2013 to offer Reiki Classes and host Healing Circles twice
a month. Since its conception and continuous growth in numbers, our
core members Spogga Hash, Richard Valley and I have talked about
finding a larger space so that we can offer more to our spiritual
community. We have found the PERFECT location in the French Quarter

spiritual items, art, and jewelry, We will offer Reiki healing
sessions, massage by a licensed massage therapist and aromatherapy.
We will also offer Intuitive Tarot and Palm readings on our first floor.

<p>
</p><p>The second floor is a large open space
that was once used as a jazz club. It has a stage with a grand piano,

Psychic Fairs, Community Holiday Gatherings, Guided Meditations and
also rent out the space to private parties such as weddings, social

down 2 walls, replace several doors, repair damaged floors, seal the

I wanted to do it by bringing to life missrizos.com, a curly hair blog I created in 2011 and turning it into Miss Rizos Salón, a place created to celebrate and empower us. </p><p>Thanks to the help of so many incredible people and all of my savings lol, in December of 2014 we opened the doors of Miss Rizos Salón in the Colonial Zone in Santo Domingo. We started with a team of 2 and we are now a team of 20! We see more than 500 women, men, and children every month and we’ve reached more that 5,000 little girls in all of the country. </p><p>Many of our clients fly from around the world, but specifically from New York City, to visit our salon. So, for years we’ve been anxiously awaiting this moment to finally bring our incredible service and love for curly hair to New York City! Although this all comes with an immense sense of fear and many questions, yet again, I’ve decided to do it afraid and together with an incredible team, make this idea come to life. </p><h2>Our Impact</h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554066889/nr9qqzrhhd94x7d4gnzf.png"" src=""""/></p><h3><i><strong>Soy Niña Soy Importante</strong></i></h3><p>For the past 4 summers we have been working with a girl’s summer camp in Miches called Soy Niña Soy Importante (I am a girl and I am important), reaching over 1,500 girls (ages 9-13). In collaboration with other activists and educators, we’ve created an incredible curriculum that teaches beauty, identity and empowerment to little girls through fun and interactive activities. We have trained Peace Corps Volunteers to do these same activities in their communities, reaching thousands of other girls. </p><p>In March of this year we were invited to a special event in Miches hosted by a group of 11 girls who graduated 1-3 years ago from the camp. They were inspired by the work we did and created a group called Curly Girls of Miches. They congregated nearly 40 other young adults from the community to share all they knew about curls. Thanks to the incredible work of the camp director, we will be able to now train these girls who range from 16-19 years old, so that they can become peer educators and volunteers at the summer camps starting this year. They also asked us to get them access to the school system there so that they could also teach about self-love and curly hair! </p><h3><i><strong>Curly Girl Comic Book: Super Rizadas </strong></i></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554103218/ruc3br5ciu6y6zyxnbq6.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554103226/xmazcgjciyzrab4zanxh.png"" src=""""/></p><p>I realized that instead of complaining about the lack of representation in the media and all industries for that matter, I could create a superhero that looked like me. Dominican artist Nathalie Rodriguez helped me bring this incredible project into reality. I wrote a story about a little girl who wasn’t accepted in her classroom because of her hair, so a curly superhero read her the article in the constitution that protected her rights. We have free copies of these comics at Miss Rizos Salón and have distributed over 7,000 to children all around the country. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554098315/rn00yrphxmmfgyqv8khs.png"" src=""""/></p><h2>What we are bringing Uptown</h2><p>We are planning to bring a space that revolutionizes the way people see and think about our hair in our community. Miss Rizos Salón will offer everyday hair maintenance services, curly hair education, the best curly hair products and accessories for your hair. We will be your one stop shop for everything rizos!</p><p>We grew up going to the salon, this being a hub for therapy, support and love amongst the women in our community. After deciding to return to our natural hair we often miss this feeling of walking in to a familiar space where we could disconnect from the everyday hustle and bustle of our lives. Miss Rizos Salón is this and so much more and we are so excited to open our doors to this new and vibrant community. </p><p>We plan to continue operating as a purpose driven business in New York and host fieldtrips to our salon, train our staff to give workshops at schools and organizations in the city, and offer fun and impactful initiatives for our community.</p><p>Check out our incredible perks that will allow you to get our services at a special price, get personalized product recommendations, and give you the opportunity to give back to a little girl or an entire classroom! Don’t forget to share this with all your tías and primos please! </p><p>The big question of course is when we are opening, and although we want to do it this summer of 2019, we understand that things take time here. We will continue to work day and night but will also be patient as we go through these processes. </p><h2>Why we need your help </h2><p>Getting Miss Rizos Salón NYC up and running is easier said than done. We are not going to sugarcoat the incredibly challenging processes that we have lived in the past few months. When I tell you that our communities are changing, I mean it.

I wanted to do it by bringing to life missrizos.com, a curly hair blog I created in 2011 and turning it into Miss Rizos Salón, a place created to celebrate and empower us. Thanks to the help of so many incredible people and all of my savings lol, in December of 2014 we opened the doors of Miss Rizos Salón in the Colonial Zone in Santo Domingo. We started with a team of 2 and we are now a team of 20! We see more than 500 women, men, and children every month and we’ve reached more that 5,000 little girls in all of the country. Many of our clients fly from around the world, but specifically from New York City, to visit our salon. So, for years we’ve been anxiously awaiting this moment to finally bring our incredible service and love for curly hair to New York City! Although this all comes with an immense sense of fear and many questions, yet again, I’ve decided to do it afraid and together with an incredible team, make this idea come to life. Our ImpactSoy Niña Soy ImportanteFor the past 4 summers we have been working with a girl’s summer camp in Miches called Soy Niña Soy Importante (I am a girl and I am important), reaching over 1,500 girls (ages 9-13). In collaboration with other activists and educators, we’ve created an incredible curriculum that teaches beauty, identity and empowerment to little girls through fun and interactive activities. We have trained Peace Corps Volunteers to do these same activities in their communities, reaching thousands of other girls. In March of this year we were invited to a special event in Miches hosted by a group of 11 girls who graduated 1-3 years ago from the camp. They were inspired by the work we did and created a group called Curly Girls of Miches. They congregated nearly 40 other young adults from the community to share all they knew about curls. Thanks to the incredible work of the camp director, we will be able to now train these girls who range from 16-19 years old, so that they can become peer educators and volunteers at the summer camps starting this year. They also asked us to get them access to the school system there so that they could also teach about self-love and curly hair! Curly Girl Comic Book: Super Rizadas I realized that instead of complaining about the lack of representation in the media and all industries for that matter, I could create a superhero that looked like me. Dominican artist Nathalie Rodriguez helped me bring this incredible project into reality. I wrote a story about a little girl who wasn’t accepted in her classroom because of her hair, so a curly superhero read her the article in the constitution that protected her rights. We have free copies of these comics at Miss Rizos Salón and have distributed over 7,000 to children all around the country. What we are bringing UptownWe are planning to bring a space that revolutionizes the way people see and think about our hair in our community. Miss Rizos Salón will offer everyday hair maintenance services, curly hair education, the best curly hair products and accessories for your hair. We will be your one stop shop for everything rizos!We grew up going to the salon, this being a hub for therapy, support and love amongst the women in our community. After deciding to return to our natural hair we often miss this feeling of walking in to a familiar space where we could disconnect from the everyday hustle and bustle of our lives. Miss Rizos Salón is this and so much more and we are so excited to open our doors to this new and vibrant community. We plan to continue operating as a purpose driven business in New York and host fieldtrips to our salon, train our staff to give workshops at schools and organizations in the city, and offer fun and impactful initiatives for our community.Check out our incredible perks that will allow you to get our services at a special price, get personalized product recommendations, and give you the opportunity to give back to a little girl or an entire classroom! Don’t forget to share this with all your tías and primos please! The big question of course is when we are opening, and although we want to do it this summer of 2019, we understand that things take time here. We will continue to work day and night but will also be patient as we go through these processes. Why we need your help Getting Miss Rizos Salón NYC up and running is easier said than done. We are not going to sugarcoat the incredibly challenging processes that we have lived in the past few months. When I tell you that our communities are changing, I mean it. Leases in the Washington Heights and Inwood area, where we plan to open, are incredibly high, licensing and other fees are also a nightmare. Our salon in DR is still growing and could not support the financing of this project, and although we have some seed funding from an angel investor (who is also a Dominican woman by the way), we still need to raise funds for:
Lease 
Legal fees
Licenses 
Inventory
Training
Equipment + furniture
Remodeling and so much more
