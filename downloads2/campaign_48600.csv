<p>We are setting out to create and sustain jobs in the USA while working towards a healthier planet. We are all about the dreamers changing expectations. We know it is as simple as the choice you make. You choose who you support and hold them accountable. The purchase of each of our shirts makes a difference. Not in some abstract way, but a tangible difference. We believe in a new standard for American business. This is our America and we want her back.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What makes us different?</strong></p>
<p>It starts with the design. We collaborate with a variety of artists from musicians to painters, from photographers to sculptors to create raw unprocessed art. Then you add a shirt made in America, with American organic textiles and hand-screen print those here in the United States. Think we are done? Not yet… When those shirts are sold, we give back and make a change.</p>
<p>We have chosen to donate to six organizations. A portion from the sale of our products goes to each organization. These organizations include World Wildlife Fund, 1% for the Planet, VH1 Save The Music Foundation, indiegogo, Opportunity Finance Network, and Feeding America. That means that for each shirt that is sold: we will be feeding American families, planting trees, creating American jobs, helping animals, funding dreams and saving music.</p>
<p>We are going to do this while keeping our clothing competitively priced.</p>
<p>It is my pleasure to introduce to you…Proper Villain Clothing.</p>
<p><br/> <br/><strong>What Is The Proper Villain Story?</strong><br/><br/>The first design was made using scissors, electrical tape and spray paint. It was raw and simple but Proper Villain continued to change. It has evolved into more than another image on a shirt. It's about responsibility, both socially and economically. It's about the way the business is run almost as much as the shirts. Instead of relying on heavily branded imagery, the goal became to use causes to maintain a connection with the audience while keeping as much artistic integrity as possible. It's not just about profits; it's about making an example.<br/><br/><br/><strong>What Is The Money Going To Be Used For?</strong><br/><br/>I've vested my heart and soul into this brand and am ready to transform this dream into a tangible, positive difference in this world. However, I realize that to affect a greater immediate change, your help and support is what is needed. That's where you come in! With the help of IndieGoGo, I hope to raise enough money to produce the first line of shirts, as well as help with the costs of a website. Please help me make America the place that we all know it can be.</p>
<p><br/><br/><strong>What Makes Your Shirts So Epic?</strong><br/><br/>It's an amazing thing how much each shirt really does for both America and the planet. Besides the fact that we use 100% certified organic cotton grown from non-genetically altered seeds and that it flourishes without the use of chemical pesticides or fertilizers, that it's grown in the USA and keeps our farmers farming, our products are also made in the USA and we are committed to following all fair labor standards and practices. Our shirts are hand-printed using eco-friendly methods to minimize the effects on the planet. Every aspect of the creation of this shirt has the creation and sustainment of American jobs in mind, which does not even include donations. Some donations are harder to break down on per shirt level, but two things that each purchase of a shirt does is provide four meals for Americans and plant five trees! Pretty epic, wouldn't you say?<br/><br/><br/><strong>You Mentioned Donations. Could You Tell Me More?</strong><br/><br/>I'm glad you asked. I'd love to tell you more!<br/><br/><em>1% For The Planet</em>:<br/>The idea is simple. At least 1% of sales goes to improving the planet. It's a simple pledge. We care deeply for our planet and have decided to use our donation to plant trees through an organization called Trees For The Future. We are able to plant five trees per shirt purchased.<br/><br/><em>VH1 Save The Music Foundation</em>:<br/>Music has always been important to me. When you do research about what learning to play music does, then you hear about music programs that are being cut, you'll want to do what you can to save it. <br/><br/><em>Indiegogo</em>:<br/>Indiegogo is about funding the independent creation. This is directly helping people follow their dreams. If it wasn't for Indiegogo, this would just be an impossible dream for me. Obviously the opportunity to give back and help fund dreams is something I couldn't resist.<br/><br/><em>Opportunity Finance Network</em>:<br/>This is an amazing cause and things like this is what America needs right now. Donations go towards investing in opportunities that benefit low-income, low-wealth and other disadvantaged communities across America. They know that community business creates jobs and have created more than 64% of new jobs in the past 15 years. Donations don't just go to creating jobs, they go to sustaining them as well.<br/><br/><em>Feeding America</em>:<br/>Much of what I'm donating helps to make tomorrow better. Some people are having a hard enough time today. My donations here help provide nutritious, fresh foods to Americans struggling with hunger; safe and nurturing places for children to have a meal; emergency assistance for disaster victims; as well as a chance at self-sufficiency for adults trying to break the cycle of poverty and hunger. Four meals are provided with each shirt purchase.</p>
<p><em>WWF</em>:<br/>Humans have had a major impact on the planet. We haven't always cared about things as much as we should have. WWF is about more than protecting wildlife. It's about finding a balance between people and nature. The number of amazing animals that are facing the possibility of extinction in our lifetime is sad. The thought of my grandchildren never having the chance to see so many amazing animals but only able to hear about them and see them in books is not acceptable to me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>* Please note that the donation aspect of this project is intended for future sales. No part of the money raised on indiegogo will go towards anything other than making and selling shirts.</p>
<p><br/> <br/><strong>On A Personal Note:</strong><br/><br/>I want to thank you for taking the time to look over my project. This means a lot to me. I'm glad I was able to share my dream with you. So again, thank you. If you like what you have read and you want to get involved, please help me get the word out.</p></div>","About Us:

I could integrate that Reebok Pump internal inflation concept into the high heels! Instead of forming a ""locking"" or ""sealing"" around the ankle, as the Reebok Pump does, the internal inflatable cushions would be strategically placed to support/relieve the Abductor Hallucis, Flexor Digitorum, Plantar Fasica, Tarsals and the Metatarsals (actually, relieve the pressure that the Metatarsals place on the ""ball"" of the foot) .

A little about me:This is the idea guy L.A. Walker...but just call me Alex if you like. I've been an Event Manager and professional DJ/host & presenter for the past 11 years for all kinds of events and shows around the world and it has been a great ride so far. I got into event management, designing and developing awesome themes and party labels for my clients, always raising the bar, designing extraordinary atmospheres, developing sick performances and shows while delivering unique experiences to the guest and my clients. 
The Archimedes Moment: 
Okay, here it is: I spend a lot of time at parties in night clubs, lounges, hotels events, concerts halls, operas, theaters, etc...and I ALWAYS see absolutely gorgeous, empty high heels on the floor or just randomly sitting on the table in the vip area and I wondered why are they are dancing barefoot??!! Are they trying to feel the beat more? Can they break it down better?? Then I realized--THEIR FEET HURT. It then became clear to me why ALL of my buddies and female friends always have to leave my events and go home--their girlfriend's/date's feet are hurting!Guys never have this problem because we all WEAR COMFORTABLE SHOES with well cushioned soles. I saw this one woman wearing a pair of those high heels that look like sneakers and it hit me! I had that Archimedes moment in the middle of my set! I could integrate that Reebok Pump internal inflation concept into the high heels! Instead of forming a ""locking"" or ""sealing"" around the ankle, as the Reebok Pump does, the internal inflatable cushions would be strategically placed to support/relieve the Abductor Hallucis, Flexor Digitorum, Plantar Fasica, Tarsals and the Metatarsals (actually, relieve the pressure that the Metatarsals place on the ""ball"" of the foot) . Totally forgot to mix the next track while playing my set--was kinda embarrassing.       GUYS I AM NOT A DOCTOR NOR AM I STUDYING MEDICINE OR ANATOMY !! ALSO, I AM NOT A CERTIFIED PODIATRIST. SO, FOR ANYONE LOOKING TO CORRECT THE SCIENTIFIC TERMS I USED ABOVE, PLEASE FEEL FREE TO DO SO....................................................................................................Research, it was JUST research... :o))I spent the next few months just randomly interviewing women in heels...getting them to show me the areas where they experienced the most soreness and discomfort. Most of them thought I was some kinda perv until I explained that my intentions were to produce a product that would alleviate that pain so they could dance all night...at which point I became their best friend. :o))I bought a bunch of those little silicone pads that women put in their shoes to prevent soreness and blisters...found myself twisting, pinching, biting(yes I bit a few of them in the name of science) and folding them to find out how I might be able to integrate them with this idea. I know some of you reading, especially the ladies, are wondering if I actually tried walking in heels to better understand precisely WHAT women experience and just to put your minds at rest--yes, I did. FYI: it is NOT easy to find size 13 platform heels people!! Its even harder to find a pair that look half way decent :o)) :D (some of my early sketches)All contributions will be used to help me: 
develop and realize this product, including working and promo prototypes in a few of the common sizes.
secure the proper resources to bring this product to market for women everywhere who enjoy dancing and looking great in their heels. 

cover a portion of the consulting fees (Podiatrist, Knee & Spine specialist) and legal fees. 

If the funding goal is not reached then it is ONLY FAIR that I return the contributions. It would not be wise OR fair to anyone to begin the project without proper, I should say sufficient, funding.
What we Need & What You Get
I'm bootstrapping and financing everything I can. Fortunately, travel expenses are practically zero because of all the resources available here in Berlin...its pretty awesome because this is such a start-up friendly city. :o)
Most of the funding will go towards the OEM & ODM development and production of the micro version of the inflation mechanism. The supplier will have to create a new mold and this costs upwards of $3000. I have a few quotes from different  suppliers and this is the lowest so far. I will keep looking for a more reasonable price. 
I am also favoring using a 3D printer which would help reduce the prototype development and production costs.
The legal fees for the Utility Patent search and using the Intellectual Property from Paul Litchfeld (<---invented the internal inflation mechanism for the Reebok Pump) will require a small portion of the funding. I have a patent lawyer that I have been using since 2007 for my ideas. Its only 5 subway stations from my apartment.

We wanted to make earrings that can be worn on the daily. So that is why we decided to keep our designs simple yet unique.

Pair it with your favorite old earrings for a fresh new look!Although our drops pairs perfectly with our offered studs, they were designed to pair well with almost any other stud earrings. So feel free to mix and match to create your own styles!      Sketch > Rendering > Production Tia Korea focuses on making simple designs that can be part of anyone's wardrobe essentials. The key is the selection of types and sizes of the gemstones and technology used to cut the gemstones to maximize light reflection. Then a creating a design for each piece to bring these pieces together to make a beautiful and unique product. The entire process from sketch to completion is hand-made by craftsmen with more than 30 years of experience.We focused on designs that are simple yet unique and luxurious. The Rose Gold Ribbon Earring with the Long Drop  The Pave-style stone setting process Please zoom in at a TIA Daily earring... Pave Set Gemstones Cheaper earrings use a bonding method in which stones are attached with a bonding agent (aka glue), so the gemstones often pop off easily making the product fragile. The Tia Daily Set using the method called pave setting, only used in high-end jewelry craftmanship, hence giving each piece a luxurious and durable finish. In the case of pave setting, the degree of quality of the setting varies greatly on the skill of the craftsman, and it is often used for elaborate hand-made designs.Tia Korea understands the important of craftsmanship hence uses the finest craftsmen available in the jewelry market.*In the case of pearl earrings, due to their round nature, the pearls are set by bonding rather than paving.All our products are crafted with pave setting techniques which allow for a significantly more durable gemstone setting and a luxurious finish. Have you ever experienced discoloration and allergic reaction after wearing jewelry? This issue typically stems from cheap or thin plating, which can chip or peel off. Therefore plating is the critical component in jewelry because it is outer layer that gives protection, shine and color. 3 mils of gold plating and 5 mils of white gold plating are only used by the premium jewelry makers. Plating costs have risen due to the recent increases in the price of gold, hence many lower-end jewelry makers use thinner plating to reduce costs. However Tia Korea does not make compromises with plating and only uses premium plating. Official Plating Thickness Certificate All of Tia Korea's earrings' needles are made of 925 silver with platinum and rose/yellow gold plating to make them safe and hypoallergenic.The earring clutch backs are also made with pure 925 engraved silver to provide comfort and safety to the users.925 Sterling Silver Engraved Silver Clutch With Tia Korea's philosophy of pursuing perfection up to the final finish, we have generously invested in quality plating and hypoallergenic materials for all our products.*Because everyone's skin is different, please note that some people may still experience allergies with our products even when hypoallergenic materials are used.** Due to the characteristics of long drop, the clutch is not made of silver. However it is still treated with nickel-free plating to make it hypoallergenic. TIA uses the highest quality Cubic Zirconia gemstones with strong light reflection and brilliance. Below is the difference between TIA advanced Cubic Zirconia and cheaper synthetic gemstones. Can you see the difference? All Cubic Zirconia used in Tia Korea earrings are triple A grade. Triple A zirconia stones are more durable than other lower grade synthetic gemstones, and have higher degrees of clarity and sparkle.In addition to the quality of the gemstones, Tia Korea Earrings enhance the divergence and refraction of light by design. Each stone is precisely cut using facets to bring out the best features of the Zirconia Cubic.One batch is diamonds and the other Triple A Grade Zirconia. Can you tell which is which? The left side stones are the diamonds, and the right side stones are the TIA luxury cubics. Even though the photo was shot with a high-definition camera, the Zirconia Cubic used in TIA's Earrings displays the same the gloss and sparkle as the diamond. (We did a random test within our team of five to pick out which they think is the diamond. Three ""incorrectly"" picked the Zirconia.)   All products of Tia Earrings are available for free After Service for 2 years.

<p>I already have a proof from the manufacturer. I have a lot of experience in the print industry, and have done everything I can to ensure that the pins will look as similar to the mockups as possible. I have looked through physical pantone books rather than just relying on the computer to get more accurate colors. They will probably appear more concave than convex as they appear in the mockups.

<p>
</p><p>If you usually use a headset on a daily basis, you will perfectly catch the HeadWatch concept. If you don’t use, probably is for the same reasons that the persons that use don’t like to use them, so the HeadWatch is for you too.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">When you think on headset, two types of images pops up: messy wires everywhere or broken wireless headset. None of these images? Well, probably you lost your headset, which is also common.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/427170/files/20140311160449-Before_HeadWatch.jpg?1394579089"" src="""" style=""width: 175.5px; height: 156px;""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Well, it doesn't need to be like that, HeadWatch solves perfectly your problem! HeadWatch combines headset and smartwatch, so you will get all the notifications and interactions of a smartwatch with the great advantage to pull out the headset and fit on your ear.</span><br/></p>
<p>Yes, you understood it correctly, because… receiving calls on smartwatch and talk to your wrist… is not so attractive and convenient!</p>
<p>HeadWatch gives you all the comfort of a smartwatch combined with the practical features of a headset for making calls. Be also aware that your smartphone is growing, literaly! Handling the smartphone is becoming trickier, probably it is not in your pocket!   Convinced? Check the video presentation!</p>

<p>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">What is the HeadWatch?</span>
<br/></p>
<p>HeadWatch is a smartwatch composed by a wrist strap and a watch which could be detached and used on the ear as headset. The patent pending HeadWatch technology was created by engineers with design thinking soul. The problem to solve is simple: how can we improve the experience of the headset avoiding the situations faced by every user of losing it or just broken. The best answer was to augment the watch that we know and really create a smart watch with the design and technology capabilities to enable both usage as a smartwatch and as a headset.</p>
<p>Last years some new technology interactions were created and the human being evolved by their usage, example given the finger slide on the screens has just few years.</p>
<p>We are looking for funding to help us to make this amazing smartwatch a reality and contribute to the humanity evolution introducing a new way of interaction and the movement of sliding a technology brick from your wrist till your ear!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/419907/files/20140308100917-IMG__7___Medium_.jpg?1394302157"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">How does it work?</span>
<p>Headwatch is a smartwach that pairs with your smarphone and extends the interaction to your wrist. The Headwatch also could be detached and used on your ear as a wireless headset. You will do not need to deal again with the mess of wired headsets or loose and break your wireless headset. </p>

…and many more!

When design and technology fit together!
A technology mutation has created a completely new way of interaction between the human being and smartphone.




UPDATE (11-MARCH-2014):
HeadWatch, a headset or a smartwatch!?

If you usually use a headset on a daily basis, you will perfectly catch the HeadWatch concept. If you don’t use, probably is for the same reasons that the persons that use don’t like to use them, so the HeadWatch is for you too.
When you think on headset, two types of images pops up: messy wires everywhere or broken wireless headset. None of these images? Well, probably you lost your headset, which is also common.



Well, it doesn't need to be like that, HeadWatch solves perfectly your problem! HeadWatch combines headset and smartwatch, so you will get all the notifications and interactions of a smartwatch with the great advantage to pull out the headset and fit on your ear.
Yes, you understood it correctly, because… receiving calls on smartwatch and talk to your wrist… is not so attractive and convenient!
HeadWatch gives you all the comfort of a smartwatch combined with the practical features of a headset for making calls. Be also aware that your smartphone is growing, literaly! Handling the smartphone is becoming trickier, probably it is not in your pocket!   Convinced? Check the video presentation!



What is the HeadWatch?

HeadWatch is a smartwatch composed by a wrist strap and a watch which could be detached and used on the ear as headset. The patent pending HeadWatch technology was created by engineers with design thinking soul. The problem to solve is simple: how can we improve the experience of the headset avoiding the situations faced by every user of losing it or just broken. The best answer was to augment the watch that we know and really create a smart watch with the design and technology capabilities to enable both usage as a smartwatch and as a headset.
Last years some new technology interactions were created and the human being evolved by their usage, example given the finger slide on the screens has just few years.
We are looking for funding to help us to make this amazing smartwatch a reality and contribute to the humanity evolution introducing a new way of interaction and the movement of sliding a technology brick from your wrist till your ear!

How does it work?
Headwatch is a smartwach that pairs with your smarphone and extends the interaction to your wrist. The Headwatch also could be detached and used on your ear as a wireless headset. You will do not need to deal again with the mess of wired headsets or loose and break your wireless headset. 
A set of features are also onboard to augment your environment through sensors to capture movements, ambient and object temperatures and luminosity sensor. RGB strip lights for notifications could be configured at your flavour to fit your own style.
The simplicity of the interface is such that the HeadWatch is button less, all the experience is though the coloured touchscreen. 
The HeadWatch is compatible with iPhone, Android and Windows devices.


UPDATE (19-MARCH-2014):
HeadWatch and the App(lication)s
The HeadWatch nature opens a new concept of integration of features that apparently has no relation but are closely related.
The HeadWatch is provided with a common applications set which includes the smartwatch notifications interface and agenda, the headset facilities and the temperature sensor that enables to measure either ambient as object temperatures.


The applications for messaging and social networks (facebook and twitter) are also onboard as the settings face for your profile customization.

The Slide show application is also included on the default applications set in addition to the visual smartphone pairing and basic Activity tracker.

Check out the HeadWatch campaign stretch goals to see the additional Apps that could be included on the default HeadWatch Software.
The 3rd parties applications development for HeadWatch is also promoted through the HeadWatch SDK that will be made available.

<p></p>
<p>Thank you for visiting our page! This project is about financing the printing and manufacturing of tank tops for women with all-over comics designs from the famous <b>DC</b> &amp; <b>Marvel</b> universes.</p>
<p></p>
<center><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/360764/files/20140210085326-header2.png?1392051206"" src="""" style=""""/></center>

<p></p>
<p>This idea came to me when a friend of mine was amused by my huge comics t-shirt collection. She was jealous that I had so many when she could only find classic Batman logo tank tops, girly/glittery t-shirts or simply t-shirts that she wouldn't wear because the cut wouldn't fit her well.</p>
<p></p>
<center><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/206207/files/20131118071847-visuels_nuls.png?1384787927"" src="""" style=""""/></center>
<p></p>
<p>Here it was, I thought that it could be interesting to offer women who happen to like comics the opportunity to find something different.</p>
<p>So I launched a crowd funding here in France that allowed me to produce and ship the first collection with three beautiful Batman &amp; Wonder Woman designs.</p>
<p></p>
<center><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/592320/files/20140520103416-fanswear.png?1400607256"" src="""" style=""""/></center>
<p></p>
<p>I then thought that maybe, in other countries as well, some ladies would enjoy nice and feminine super heroes tank tops which is why we are here on IndieGoGo.</p>
<p>With this new crowd funding campaign, we would like to expand the collection  by adding more designs to it and especially Marvel super heroes!</p>
<p></p>
<center><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/568427/files/20140509095541-why.png?1399654541"" src="""" style=""""/></center>
<p></p>
<p>Simply because I feel that comics drawings and designs aren't always used for the art they are but only to advertise something else such as a movie, comic books or video games, when the graphics and the comics style is a real art in itself that deserves to be proudly worn.</p>
<p></p>
<center><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/576090/files/20140513031222-alexross.jpg?1399975942"" src="""" style=""""/></center>
<p></p>
<p>More than that, the super heroes in these stories have values, powers and ambitions that make them icons inviting people to <b>outdo themselves</b> and change the world around them.</p>
<p>I believe that clothing can be more than something with a nice drawing on it but accessories that <b>make you feel special</b>, aspiring to something greater, for you and for others.</p>
<p></p>
<center><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/568429/files/20140509095609-designs.png?1399654569"" src="""" style=""""/></center>
<p></p>
<p>With this new crowdfunding campaign, we would like to expand our collection to Marvel characters and designs and here are a few mockups of the one we selected.</p>
<p></p>
<center>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/572477/files/20140511163947-hulk.png?1399851587"" src="""" style=""""/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/621169/files/20140602141525-phenix.png?1401743725"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</center>
<p></p>
<p><i>Please note that these mockups are meant to get the approval for production from Marvel and might change according to their guidelines and recommandations.</i></p>
<p>The printing process is called sublimation which allows the high quality printing we need for a product that you will want to wear every time you want to feel like a superhero. It never washes away. Never, ever. Except maybe if you dip it in acid, like the Joker in <i>The Killing Joke.</i></p>
<p></p>
<center><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/576549/files/20140513070045-printclose.png?1399989645"" src="""" style=""""/></center>
<p></p>
<p>However, sublimation printing can sometimes leave white spots and stripes on the t-shirts, depending on where the wrinkles are when the printing is done. <b>But we don’t!</b> We wanted to have the best quality available so selected a process to have them made without any white spots/stripes/cuts that would make the visuals imperfect.</p>
<p></p>
<center><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/576550/files/20140513070105-wrinkleclose.png?1399989665"" src="""" style=""""/></center>
<p></p>
<p>The front fabric is a soft and light polyester that doesn't shrink or move as you wash it, perfect for this Summer! The back is in plain old cotton, to feel comfortable in these (hopefully) hot Summer days!</p>
<p></p>
<center><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/576561/files/20140513070603-cut.png?1399989963"" src="""" style=""""/></center>
<p></p>
<p>Because you are women and like to dress as such, it was mandatory that the cut was nice and would fit you well. This is the main reason why we decided to design the cut and make it exactly how a feminine top should look like instead of buying a bulk of ready to print apparel that fits every size but that actually don’t fit anyone.</p>
<p>It is a relaxed fit, a little bit fitting on the waist, perfect with rough jeans and a jacket or flip flops over your bikini on the beach.</p>
<p>Here is the size chart</p>
<p></p>
<center><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/592476/files/20140520113311-sizes.png?1400610791"" src="""" style=""""/></center>
<p></p>
<p><i>Please note that the mockups were realized to present the visuals but the cut will be the one that you can see in the pictures of our customers, based on the first collection produced. <b>Try to measure at least your breast to have a size that fits you well!</b></i></p>
<p><i><b>About selecting your size, you will receive an email at the end of the campaign to select your size and your design.</b></i></p>
<p></p>
<center><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/576834/files/20140513090509-team.png?1399997109"" src="""" style=""width: 560px; height: 50px;""/></center>
<p></p>
<p>In the WHW team, there are three people:</p>
<p>Kathleen is the stylist, she helps me selecting the designs and helped me select the right cut for women. She studied fashion here in Paris and can design, cut, sew and is the one who says what fits and what doesn't because I surely can't.</p>
<p>Virginie is the PR genius. She helps me communicate about my project and contact relevant blogs and news sites thanks to which you might be here today!</p>
<p>And there's me, Nathanaël. I'm a comics fan and I simply feel that this is the right thing to do. For now this is nice comics tank tops but I hope I could develop it to something more elaborate like hoodies, jackets, different kind of tops, other creative universes from Sci-Fi, Heroic Fantasy, Video Games etc.</p>
<p></p>
<center><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/576836/files/20140513090533-funds.png?1399997133"" src="""" style=""""/></center>
<p></p>
<p>I know that for some, 30€/$40 can sound like a lot of money for a tank top so here is an explanation of the different costs of the manufacturing process:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Sublimation printing: </b>sublimation printing is much more expensive than a simple inking on a white tee giving however much better results, precise printing and vibrant colors that never fade away.</li>
<li>
<b>Manufacturing:</b> because we designed a specific cut, we cannot have ""on demand"" manufacturing that would keep our initial investment at a minimum and need to produce a few hundred tanks for every model.</li>
<li>
<b>Licence fee:</b> DC &amp; Marvel characters are extremely famous and it goes without saying that we have to thank the artists who created such amazing stories. All the products produced thanks to this crowd funding are 100% authorized and licensed.</li>
<li>
<b>Shipping:</b> Standard worldwide shipping is included. If you want to be able to track your parcel, please add an extra 5€ to your contribution.</li>
<li>
<b>Custom fees are not included:</b> we ship from France so all the countries in the E.U. should not have any custom fees applied to their parcel. However, destinations such as the US or Canada may have some fees applied to the parcel but we have no visibility on the exact amout so couldn't include them. Apparently, gifts with a value lower than $100 (70€) do not have custom fees applied to them.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>With this 5 000 € goal we'll be able to produce the two tank tops that you see above. If we reach 10 000 € we'll be able to produce a third one. After that, we'll offer you a new cut! Who would like a boyfriend cut? Big loose armholes? A cropped top? Who said a dress? A hoodie? Oh yeah!</p>

<p></p>
<p>We ship Worldwide from France. We'll do our best to make sure that every parcel reaches destination but mistakes can happen and if you know that your address is hard to find/unreliable please contact me to see which more secure solution is available.</p>
<p>You can select any tank top already available from the DC collection but please note that they are in limited quantities. If you prefer to wait for the Marvel ones, you will have to vote for your favorite one. The most popular one will be produced and shipped then the second most popular then the third and so on. </p>
<p>Please take into account the fact that by selecting more than one tank top in the rewards, you mechanically will have to select amongst the Batman &amp; Wonder Woman tops if the goal doesn't allow to produce as many designs as you requested. You can also do it step by step which means take one top for starters and if the goal reached is higher than 5000€ switch for two tanks or more depending on what you wanted in the beginning. However, I would advise you to take from the start the reward you wanted as the success of a campaign is usually a matter of days after the launch.</p>

<p></p>
<p>From the very first spark of idea to today WHW went a long way and we managed to be present at a few events at which we were able to show what the whole project was and where we wanted to go.</p>
<p><b>Fées Minines Fashion Show</b></p>
<p></p>
<center><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/603685/files/20140525162449-fees_minines.png?1401060289"" src="""" style=""""/></center>
<p></p>
<p>At this fashion show, we were able to show the first prototypes of the DC collection we funded with the first French crowd funding. Hopefully we will be there next week with a much bigger and elaborate collection!</p>
<p><b>Geekopolis</b></p>
<p></p>
<center><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/603686/files/20140525162519-geekopolis.png?1401060319"" src="""" style=""""/></center>
<p></p>
<p>Geekopolis is pretty much the city of the geeks and regrouped different areas in which you could find all kind of geek subcultures such as steampunk, science-fiction, heroic fantasy and role gaming, japanese culture and of course comics!</p>
<p>These events were really nice and allowed us to meet our first backers and new clients who encouraged us to keep going in this direction. Maybe will we meet at such an event someday as well!</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>And, this is finally why we’re here. We know that our products can appeal to women all around the world, being comics fans or not and we want them to see that we heard them. Yes, you can wear superhero t-shirts without wearing something that makes you look like a bag of potatoes, yes you can be feminine and stylish, whether in love with the Dark Knight or simply because you think that the Joker is creepy but also such a fun guy!</p>
<p>So, if it’s not for you, you all know that girl who loves comics. <b>Let her know that we are doing it.</b></p>
<p>Do not hesitate to get in touch with WHW on<b> <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/whatheroeswear"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a>, <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/whatheroeswear"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Twitter,</a> <a href=""http://www.instagram.com/whatheroeswear"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram</a>,<a href=""http://www.pinterest.com/whatheroeswear"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Pinterest</a>  </b>or <a href=""http://whatheroeswear.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Tumblr</b></a>!</p>

<p>Merci d'avoir visité notre page! ce projet vise à produire la fabrication de débardeurs pour femmes avec des imprimés all-over des super héros connus de l'univer <b>DC</b> et <b>Marvel</b>.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Cette idée m'est venue lors d'une discussion avec une amie jalouse de ma collection de t-shirts de super héros car elle ne trouvait jamais de vêtements pour elle, autres que des t-shirts classiques avec un logo ou mal coupés ou d'une piètre qualité.</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/206207/files/20131118071847-visuels_nuls.png?1384787927"" src="""" style=""""/><p>J'ai alors pensé qu'il serait intéressant de voir si cela pourrait intéresser les gens de proposer des vêtements de comics pour femmes et j'ai donc lancé une première campagne de financement participatif qui m'a permis de créer une première série de 3 débardeurs dans l'univers DC avec des visuels Batman, Joker &amp; Wonder Woman.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/622324/files/20140603031450-fanswear.png?1401790490"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Avec cette nouvelle campagne, j'aimerais pouvoir vous proposer de nouveaux débardeurs mais dans l'univers Marvel cette fois-ci!</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/622325/files/20140603031603-pourquoi.png?1401790563"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Tout simplement parce que je trouve qu'aujourd'hui les dessins de super héros ne sont pas utilisés à leur juste valeur. Ces visuels emblématiques ne servent souvent qu'à promouvoir d'autres choses comme un film sorti récemment ou sont imprimés sur des vêtements standardisés voués à être produits en masse sans souci de la qualité du vêtement en lui-même.</p>
<p>Les super héros sont aujourd'hui plus que de simples personnages fictifs, ce sont devenus des véritables icônes, des symboles représentatifs d'un style, d'une époque et d'une culture. Il y a pour moi une évidence dans le mariage entre deux mondes qui s'opposent en apparence que sont la mode et les cultures de l'imaginaire comme les comics.</p>
<p>Dans l'imaginaire ces héros véhiculent également des valeurs fortes de courage, de respect et de force. Lorsque je porte moi-même un t-shirt de comics, j'ai toujours ce petit sourire en coin de me sentir un peu à part parce que sous mon pull se cachent Batman ou les X-Men. Cette sensation j'espère que vous la ressentirez aussi avec un débardeur What Heroes Wear et c'est tout l'état d'esprit de cette marque: des vêtements pour vous faire vous sentir comme les super héros de votre propre vie.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/622493/files/20140603051419-visuels.png?1401797659"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Avec cette nouvelle campagne, j'aimerais élargir la gamme de WHW dans l'univers Marvel avec ces deux premiers débardeurs.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/622559/files/20140603054644-hulk.png?1401799604"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p></p>
<p><i>Notez que ces visuels sont des mockups pour validation auprès de Marvel et peuvent changer en fonction de leurs exigences et recommandations.</i></p>
<p>Le processus d'impression est appelé sublimation et permet d'avoir des couleurs vives et précises qui sont incrustées dans la fibre et qui ne déteindront jamais et ne perdront jamais de leur éclat.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/622589/files/20140603060223-printclose.png?1401800543"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Le débardeur est en polyester léger à l'avant et coton à l'arrière pour offrir couleurs vives et légèreté à ce vêtement pour un été, on l'espère chaud et ensoleillé!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/622591/files/20140603060250-coup.png?1401800570"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Parce qu'il est important d'avoir une coupe qui soit féminine et tranche avec les classiques t-shirts informes habituellement proposés aux femmes, nous avons travaillé avec Kathleen à la conception d'une coupe qui serait un classique et s'adapterait à toutes vos tenues.</p>
<p>Légèrement ajustée à la taille avec un léger décolleté, ces débardeurs seront parfaits avec un jean et une veste classique ou un short et bikini sur la plage.</p>
<p>Voici le guide des tailles.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/622699/files/20140603070229-sizes.png?1401804149"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>Notez que ces mockups ont été réalisés pour présenter les visuels. La coupe sera par contre celle que vous pouvez voir sur les précédents contributeurs. <b>Essayez de mesurer au moins votre tour de poitrine pour avoir une taille qui vous conviendra au mieux!</b></i></p>
<p><i><b>Vous recevrez également un email en fin de campagne pour choisir votre taille et visuel. Vous pouvez mélanger tailles et visuels pour offrir si vous le désirez.</b></i></p>
<p><i>Pour les premiers contributeurs à la campagne MMC: les tailles ont été changées pour correspondre aux standards donc XXS devient XS, XS devient S etc.</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/622613/files/20140603062114-_quipe.png?1401801674"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Dans l'équipe WHW il y a trois personnes: </p>
<p>Kathleen est la styliste du projet. Elle sait coudre, découper, assembler, retoucher et m'a aidé à choisir une coupe qui soit une vraie coupe pour femme.</p>
<p>Virginie s'est chargée des relations presse. Passionnée de bière et de lecture elle a contribué à développer la visibilité de ce projet.</p>
<p>Et puis il y a moi. Je suis un passionné de comics depuis de nombreuses années et de nombreuses rencontres m'ont amené à créer WHW. Au départ un petit projet avec des débardeurs, j'espère pouvoir rapidement l'amener à un projet plus ambitieux avec des pièces plus complexes, inspirées des univers imaginaires comme les comics ou la science-fiction, les jeux vidéos etc.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/622715/files/20140603070819-fonds.png?1401804499"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>30€ peut représenter beaucoup d'argent pour un débardeur donc voici une explication des différents coûts auxquels nous devons faire face avec ce projet:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Impression en sublimation: </b>l'impression en sublimation nous permet d'avoir un visuel sur l'intégralité du débardeur et des couleurs vives qui ne pâliront jamais au lavage. C'est un procédé plus coûteux qu'une impression classique mais la qualité est incomparable.</li>
<li>
<b>Fabrication des débardeurs:</b> puisque nous avons décidé dde définir une coupe de débardeur qui soit unique et féminine, nous ne pouvions pas fonctionner avec des vêtements déjà fabriqués qui ne permettent pas une impression intégrale aisément. Chaque série est donc produite en quelques centaines d'exemplaires.</li>
<li>
<b>Licence officielle:</b> les visuels que nous utilisons sont tirés directement des univers DC et Marvel et il nous semblait évident de faire les choses comme il se devait pour remercier les artistes qui ont écrit et dessiné ces personnages emblématiques. Tous les produits WHW sont 100% officiels.</li>
<li>
<b>Expédition:</b> Les frais de port sont inclus pour chaque contribution, en France, Belgique, Suisse et Luxembourg.</li>
</ul>
<p>Avec cet objectif de 5000€ nous pourrons produire ces deux débardeurs. Un second plafond à 10 000€ nous permettra de vous proposer un nouveau visuel de l'univers Marvel. Au delà, nous essaierons de vous proposer une seconde coupe de t-shirts qui comblera vos attentes. T-shirt? Manches longues? A vous de choisir!</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>Toutes les contributions comprennent les frais de port vers l'international.</p>
<p>Vous pouvez sélectionner n'importe quel visuel de la précédente collection DC. Cependant, veuillez prendre en compte le fait que ces débardeurs sont en quantité limitée.</p>
<p>Veuillez s'il vous plaît considérer le fait que si vous sélectionnez plus de débardeurs que de débardeurs Marvel produits, vous pourrez choisir plusieurs visuels Marvel identiques ou des visuels DC pour compléter votre commande.<br/></p>

<p>De la première idée à aujourd'hui, WHW est devenu un petit projet concret grâce auquel j'ai rencontré certains d'entre vous à différentes occasions.</p>
<p><b>Défilé des Fées Minines</b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/622751/files/20140603072239-fees_minines.png?1401805359"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Ce premier petit défilé nous a permis de présenter la toute première collection de WHW. Nous espérons pouvoir revenir l'année prochaine avec une collection plus fournie!</p>

</span></div>","Thank you for visiting our page! This project is about financing the printing and manufacturing of tank tops for women with all-over comics designs from the famous DC & Marvel universes.






This idea came to me when a friend of mine was amused by my huge comics t-shirt collection. She was jealous that I had so many when she could only find classic Batman logo tank tops, girly/glittery t-shirts or simply t-shirts that she wouldn't wear because the cut wouldn't fit her well.



Here it was, I thought that it could be interesting to offer women who happen to like comics the opportunity to find something different.
So I launched a crowd funding here in France that allowed me to produce and ship the first collection with three beautiful Batman & Wonder Woman designs.



I then thought that maybe, in other countries as well, some ladies would enjoy nice and feminine super heroes tank tops which is why we are here on IndieGoGo.
With this new crowd funding campaign, we would like to expand the collection  by adding more designs to it and especially Marvel super heroes!



Simply because I feel that comics drawings and designs aren't always used for the art they are but only to advertise something else such as a movie, comic books or video games, when the graphics and the comics style is a real art in itself that deserves to be proudly worn.



More than that, the super heroes in these stories have values, powers and ambitions that make them icons inviting people to outdo themselves and change the world around them.
I believe that clothing can be more than something with a nice drawing on it but accessories that make you feel special, aspiring to something greater, for you and for others.



With this new crowdfunding campaign, we would like to expand our collection to Marvel characters and designs and here are a few mockups of the one we selected.





Please note that these mockups are meant to get the approval for production from Marvel and might change according to their guidelines and recommandations.
The printing process is called sublimation which allows the high quality printing we need for a product that you will want to wear every time you want to feel like a superhero. It never washes away. Never, ever. Except maybe if you dip it in acid, like the Joker in The Killing Joke.



However, sublimation printing can sometimes leave white spots and stripes on the t-shirts, depending on where the wrinkles are when the printing is done. But we don’t! We wanted to have the best quality available so selected a process to have them made without any white spots/stripes/cuts that would make the visuals imperfect.



The front fabric is a soft and light polyester that doesn't shrink or move as you wash it, perfect for this Summer! The back is in plain old cotton, to feel comfortable in these (hopefully) hot Summer days!



Because you are women and like to dress as such, it was mandatory that the cut was nice and would fit you well. This is the main reason why we decided to design the cut and make it exactly how a feminine top should look like instead of buying a bulk of ready to print apparel that fits every size but that actually don’t fit anyone.
It is a relaxed fit, a little bit fitting on the waist, perfect with rough jeans and a jacket or flip flops over your bikini on the beach.
Here is the size chart



Please note that the mockups were realized to present the visuals but the cut will be the one that you can see in the pictures of our customers, based on the first collection produced. Try to measure at least your breast to have a size that fits you well!
About selecting your size, you will receive an email at the end of the campaign to select your size and your design.



In the WHW team, there are three people:
Kathleen is the stylist, she helps me selecting the designs and helped me select the right cut for women. She studied fashion here in Paris and can design, cut, sew and is the one who says what fits and what doesn't because I surely can't.
Virginie is the PR genius. She helps me communicate about my project and contact relevant blogs and news sites thanks to which you might be here today!
And there's me, Nathanaël. I'm a comics fan and I simply feel that this is the right thing to do. For now this is nice comics tank tops but I hope I could develop it to something more elaborate like hoodies, jackets, different kind of tops, other creative universes from Sci-Fi, Heroic Fantasy, Video Games etc.



I know that for some, 30€/$40 can sound like a lot of money for a tank top so here is an explanation of the different costs of the manufacturing process:



Sublimation printing: sublimation printing is much more expensive than a simple inking on a white tee giving however much better results, precise printing and vibrant colors that never fade away.

Manufacturing: because we designed a specific cut, we cannot have ""on demand"" manufacturing that would keep our initial investment at a minimum and need to produce a few hundred tanks for every model.

Licence fee: DC & Marvel characters are extremely famous and it goes without saying that we have to thank the artists who created such amazing stories. All the products produced thanks to this crowd funding are 100% authorized and licensed.

Shipping: Standard worldwide shipping is included. If you want to be able to track your parcel, please add an extra 5€ to your contribution.

Custom fees are not included: we ship from France so all the countries in the E.U. should not have any custom fees applied to their parcel. However, destinations such as the US or Canada may have some fees applied to the parcel but we have no visibility on the exact amout so couldn't include them. Apparently, gifts with a value lower than $100 (70€) do not have custom fees applied to them.


With this 5 000 € goal we'll be able to produce the two tank tops that you see above. If we reach 10 000 € we'll be able to produce a third one. After that, we'll offer you a new cut! Who would like a boyfriend cut? Big loose armholes? A cropped top? Who said a dress? A hoodie? Oh yeah!









We ship Worldwide from France. We'll do our best to make sure that every parcel reaches destination but mistakes can happen and if you know that your address is hard to find/unreliable please contact me to see which more secure solution is available.
You can select any tank top already available from the DC collection but please note that they are in limited quantities. If you prefer to wait for the Marvel ones, you will have to vote for your favorite one. The most popular one will be produced and shipped then the second most popular then the third and so on. 
Please take into account the fact that by selecting more than one tank top in the rewards, you mechanically will have to select amongst the Batman & Wonder Woman tops if the goal doesn't allow to produce as many designs as you requested. You can also do it step by step which means take one top for starters and if the goal reached is higher than 5000€ switch for two tanks or more depending on what you wanted in the beginning. However, I would advise you to take from the start the reward you wanted as the success of a campaign is usually a matter of days after the launch.



From the very first spark of idea to today WHW went a long way and we managed to be present at a few events at which we were able to show what the whole project was and where we wanted to go.
Fées Minines Fashion Show



At this fashion show, we were able to show the first prototypes of the DC collection we funded with the first French crowd funding. Hopefully we will be there next week with a much bigger and elaborate collection!
Geekopolis



Geekopolis is pretty much the city of the geeks and regrouped different areas in which you could find all kind of geek subcultures such as steampunk, science-fiction, heroic fantasy and role gaming, japanese culture and of course comics!
These events were really nice and allowed us to meet our first backers and new clients who encouraged us to keep going in this direction. Maybe will we meet at such an event someday as well!



And, this is finally why we’re here. We know that our products can appeal to women all around the world, being comics fans or not and we want them to see that we heard them. Yes, you can wear superhero t-shirts without wearing something that makes you look like a bag of potatoes, yes you can be feminine and stylish, whether in love with the Dark Knight or simply because you think that the Joker is creepy but also such a fun guy!
So, if it’s not for you, you all know that girl who loves comics. Let her know that we are doing it.
Do not hesitate to get in touch with WHW on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest  or Tumblr!
Let’s make this happen.

Merci d'avoir visité notre page! ce projet vise à produire la fabrication de débardeurs pour femmes avec des imprimés all-over des super héros connus de l'univer DC et Marvel.



Cette idée m'est venue lors d'une discussion avec une amie jalouse de ma collection de t-shirts de super héros car elle ne trouvait jamais de vêtements pour elle, autres que des t-shirts classiques avec un logo ou mal coupés ou d'une piètre qualité.
J'ai alors pensé qu'il serait intéressant de voir si cela pourrait intéresser les gens de proposer des vêtements de comics pour femmes et j'ai donc lancé une première campagne de financement participatif qui m'a permis de créer une première série de 3 débardeurs dans l'univers DC avec des visuels Batman, Joker & Wonder Woman.



Avec cette nouvelle campagne, j'aimerais pouvoir vous proposer de nouveaux débardeurs mais dans l'univers Marvel cette fois-ci!


Tout simplement parce que je trouve qu'aujourd'hui les dessins de super héros ne sont pas utilisés à leur juste valeur. Ces visuels emblématiques ne servent souvent qu'à promouvoir d'autres choses comme un film sorti récemment ou sont imprimés sur des vêtements standardisés voués à être produits en masse sans souci de la qualité du vêtement en lui-même.
Les super héros sont aujourd'hui plus que de simples personnages fictifs, ce sont devenus des véritables icônes, des symboles représentatifs d'un style, d'une époque et d'une culture. Il y a pour moi une évidence dans le mariage entre deux mondes qui s'opposent en apparence que sont la mode et les cultures de l'imaginaire comme les comics.
Dans l'imaginaire ces héros véhiculent également des valeurs fortes de courage, de respect et de force. Lorsque je porte moi-même un t-shirt de comics, j'ai toujours ce petit sourire en coin de me sentir un peu à part parce que sous mon pull se cachent Batman ou les X-Men. Cette sensation j'espère que vous la ressentirez aussi avec un débardeur What Heroes Wear et c'est tout l'état d'esprit de cette marque: des vêtements pour vous faire vous sentir comme les super héros de votre propre vie.

Avec cette nouvelle campagne, j'aimerais élargir la gamme de WHW dans l'univers Marvel avec ces deux premiers débardeurs.




Notez que ces visuels sont des mockups pour validation auprès de Marvel et peuvent changer en fonction de leurs exigences et recommandations.
Le processus d'impression est appelé sublimation et permet d'avoir des couleurs vives et précises qui sont incrustées dans la fibre et qui ne déteindront jamais et ne perdront jamais de leur éclat.

Le débardeur est en polyester léger à l'avant et coton à l'arrière pour offrir couleurs vives et légèreté à ce vêtement pour un été, on l'espère chaud et ensoleillé!

Parce qu'il est important d'avoir une coupe qui soit féminine et tranche avec les classiques t-shirts informes habituellement proposés aux femmes, nous avons travaillé avec Kathleen à la conception d'une coupe qui serait un classique et s'adapterait à toutes vos tenues.
Légèrement ajustée à la taille avec un léger décolleté, ces débardeurs seront parfaits avec un jean et une veste classique ou un short et bikini sur la plage.
Voici le guide des tailles.

Notez que ces mockups ont été réalisés pour présenter les visuels. La coupe sera par contre celle que vous pouvez voir sur les précédents contributeurs. Essayez de mesurer au moins votre tour de poitrine pour avoir une taille qui vous conviendra au mieux!
Vous recevrez également un email en fin de campagne pour choisir votre taille et visuel. Vous pouvez mélanger tailles et visuels pour offrir si vous le désirez.
Pour les premiers contributeurs à la campagne MMC: les tailles ont été changées pour correspondre aux standards donc XXS devient XS, XS devient S etc.

Dans l'équipe WHW il y a trois personnes: 
Kathleen est la styliste du projet. Elle sait coudre, découper, assembler, retoucher et m'a aidé à choisir une coupe qui soit une vraie coupe pour femme.
Virginie s'est chargée des relations presse. Passionnée de bière et de lecture elle a contribué à développer la visibilité de ce projet.
Et puis il y a moi. Je suis un passionné de comics depuis de nombreuses années et de nombreuses rencontres m'ont amené à créer WHW. Au départ un petit projet avec des débardeurs, j'espère pouvoir rapidement l'amener à un projet plus ambitieux avec des pièces plus complexes, inspirées des univers imaginaires comme les comics ou la science-fiction, les jeux vidéos etc.

30€ peut représenter beaucoup d'argent pour un débardeur donc voici une explication des différents coûts auxquels nous devons faire face avec ce projet:


Impression en sublimation: l'impression en sublimation nous permet d'avoir un visuel sur l'intégralité du débardeur et des couleurs vives qui ne pâliront jamais au lavage. C'est un procédé plus coûteux qu'une impression classique mais la qualité est incomparable.

Fabrication des débardeurs: puisque nous avons décidé dde définir une coupe de débardeur qui soit unique et féminine, nous ne pouvions pas fonctionner avec des vêtements déjà fabriqués qui ne permettent pas une impression intégrale aisément. Chaque série est donc produite en quelques centaines d'exemplaires.

Licence officielle: les visuels que nous utilisons sont tirés directement des univers DC et Marvel et il nous semblait évident de faire les choses comme il se devait pour remercier les artistes qui ont écrit et dessiné ces personnages emblématiques. Tous les produits WHW sont 100% officiels.

Expédition: Les frais de port sont inclus pour chaque contribution, en France, Belgique, Suisse et Luxembourg.

Avec cet objectif de 5000€ nous pourrons produire ces deux débardeurs. Un second plafond à 10 000€ nous permettra de vous proposer un nouveau visuel de l'univers Marvel. Au delà, nous essaierons de vous proposer une seconde coupe de t-shirts qui comblera vos attentes. T-shirt? Manches longues? A vous de choisir!




Toutes les contributions comprennent les frais de port vers l'international.
Vous pouvez sélectionner n'importe quel visuel de la précédente collection DC. Cependant, veuillez prendre en compte le fait que ces débardeurs sont en quantité limitée.
Veuillez s'il vous plaît considérer le fait que si vous sélectionnez plus de débardeurs que de débardeurs Marvel produits, vous pourrez choisir plusieurs visuels Marvel identiques ou des visuels DC pour compléter votre commande.

De la première idée à aujourd'hui, WHW est devenu un petit projet concret grâce auquel j'ai rencontré certains d'entre vous à différentes occasions.
Défilé des Fées Minines

Ce premier petit défilé nous a permis de présenter la toute première collection de WHW. Nous espérons pouvoir revenir l'année prochaine avec une collection plus fournie!
Geekopolis

Geekopolis c'est la cité des geeks séparée en plusieurs quartiers distincts. Vous y trouverez toutes les cultures de l'imaginaire comme la science-fiction ou héroic fantasy, de la culture japonaise et bien sûr des comics!
Grâce à ces événements nous avons pu rencontre un certain nombre d'entre vous et c'est très encourageant de voir que ce projet vous plaît. Peut-être nous rencontrerons nous à un événement similaire à une prochaine occasion!

Et c'est au final la raison pour laquelle nous sommes sur IndieGoGo. La première campagne de WHW nous a montré que vous êtes nombreuses à aimer ce genre de choses et nous cherchons à répondre à vos attentes du mieux qu'il puisse se faire.
Nous espérons que vous passerez le mot à vos proches afin de faire grossir cette communauté et atteindre alors cet objectif ambitieux. Que vous soyez fan de comics ou tout simplement amusée par un t-shirt de super héros n'hésitez pas à en parler autour de vous!

<br/> Meet KP Tape Measure</h1>
<p>The KP tape
is a new tape measure that is going to revolutionize the way people measure. It’s ability
to clip onto the KP pin or an ordinary 1/2 inch lag will allow you to measure from an
exact point without the help of another person. The clip is designed 
to rotate 360 degrees allowing you to measure multiple points from a spot and
mark a perfect radius or circle. The tape is calibrated to measure from the
exact center of the KP pin or lag so you can be assured you are getting a 100 %
accurate measurement every time.</p>
<p>The KP tape
will be made with ether Imperial markings (feet and inches) or Metric markings
(centimeters) allowing it to be used worldwide. All plastic parts are made with ABS plastic and manufactured in the USA. All metal parts ( except tape blade ) are stainless steel. All the tapes are assembled in Moorpark, California.  <br/></p>

<h3>What can I do with it?</h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>Every Day Measuring.</b></p>
<p>You can use the KP tape for your 
every day measuring. The ability of the clip and pin or lag to measure 
from a exact spot will give you an 100 percent accurate measurement 
every time. This will be a great asset when you don't have someone 
around to help you measure or if you do, they might just hold you in the wrong 
spot.  <br/></p>
<p><b>Measure in the ground</b></p>
<p>The KP Tape is a great tool for measuring in the ground.  This task is made simple with the lag and clip. You will be able to measure from an exact spot in the ground without the fear of the tape blade moving or becoming unattached.    <br/></p>
<p><b>Square something up with a right angle.</b></p>
<p>You can use the KP tape with the KP pins or lags to find a right 
angle. By using the KP tape for this task, your measurements will be 
extremely accurate and precise. You will be able to do this task with 
ease and without the help of another person.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/900824/files/20141003024649-the_345_rule.png?1412329609"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The 3-4-5 rule is a great way to find a right angle because it is easy 
to remember and is extremely versatile. All though I used feet in the 
example, the 3-4-5 are actually units, which means you can use it with 
inches, feet, yards, centimeters, meters, miles and kilometers. You can 
increase the size of the right angle by multiplying each of the units by
 the same number. Example: say you pick 5 as the number. you would 
multiply 3x5=15, 4x5=20 and 5x5=25. You would have 15,20,25 as your 
units. <p></p>
<p><b>Marking a perfect radius or circle.</b></p>
<p>If you want to mark a
 radius or circle, the KP tape is the tool for the job. Having the pin 
or lag stay firmly positioned in a spot and the ability of the clip to 
rotate freely, allows you to mark your radius and circle easily and 
accurately. No need for help from another person. </p>
<p><b>Measuring off a ladder or up high<i>.</i></b></p>
<p>Say you need 
to measure something that takes a ladder.  With the KP tape, you can set
 the pin, hook the clip and move to where ever you need to measure. This
 saves you from having to get someones help and a second ladder. The 
unique ability of the clip to stay hooked on the pin with no tension on 
the blade and when it's windy will save you a lot of time and  
aggravation.</p>

<h1>The KP Story</h1>
<p>The journey began  on September 1, 2011.  I was in the construction 
industry for 30 years and after the collapse of the housing market in 
2008, I knew it was time to move on. I have always loved building things
 and always had a ton of ideas about new products. But that's all they 
were, just ideas. On that September day I decided to act on one. The 
idea was to build a clip that would attach to a flag stick used in golf 
that would stay where you attached it but still had the ability to 
rotate 360 degrees. Like most things, easier said than done. After about 2
 months and countless designs I finally figured it out. So I built a 
prototype out of wood. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/903094/files/20141004021755-prototype_clip_004.JPG?1412414275"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>It worked! I filed for a utility patent and started looking into 
producing the clip out of plastic. After showing the prototype to some 
friends one of them knew  a guy named Jim that made injection molds . He immediately took a interest and started 
working on how to make the clip out of plastic. After a few weeks of 
design we came up with a injection mold-able clip.  Jim  cut a prototype on his cnc machine out of a block of 
ABS plastic. We put it together and after some testing and tweaking , it was done. On to building the tape measure. I came up with a design 
and Jim again prototyped it. Put the whole thing together and tested it.
 It worked fantastic! I gave Jim the OK to build the 7 production molds needed 
while I procured the tape blades ( a story in itself). He finished 
the molds, we tested them, adjusted them and retested until we got them 
right. We took the molds to Pope Plastic in Chatsworth, Ca and ran a 
small production run of the parts. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/903104/files/20141004022530-part_photos_004.JPG?1412414730"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/903134/files/20141004024311-happy_camp_photos_006.JPG?1412415791"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>Anyway, along my journey, in the back of my mind, I always thought  
the tape and clip would work great in the construction industry. I started 
giving it more and more thought and came up with the idea of a short pin
 with a nail down the center that the clip could attach to. I made a 
prototype of the pin and tested it. WOW! It worked fantastic. It allowed
 me to measure things myself that before took another person to help. It
 is 100% accurate and I don't have to wonder if that other person is 
holding me in the right place. When I needed to measure something that 
takes a ladder, it used to take two people and two ladders, I can now 
measure alone with one ladder. You can even use it upside down. If you need to 
square something up , mark a radius or circle , the clip allows you to 
do this with ease and without help. Another advantage is that the clip 
stays attached even in windy conditions and doesn't require tension on 
the blade to stay attached. I then started to think about how you could measure in the ground. It 
dawned on me that a 1/2 ordinary lag screw would work perfect. I got 
one, tested it and guess what, It works fantastic.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges <br/>
</h3>Although things can certainly go wrong unexpectedly, having been 
through the whole process with the KP golf tape from design to 
fulfillment and having my supply chain complete, I see the risk to be 
minimal. By knowing how long the process actually takes allows me to be 
confident that I will be able to fulfill the perks on time and as 
promised.
<br/>One of the challenges in creating a new product is will it actually 
work as you envisioned it. This takes time and testing. I have been 
through this process already with the golf tape and have made all the 
necessary adjustments and tested the tape extensively.<br/><br/>

exact center of the KP pin or lag so you can be assured you are getting a 100 %
accurate measurement every time.
The KP tape
will be made with ether Imperial markings (feet and inches) or Metric markings
(centimeters) allowing it to be used worldwide. All plastic parts are made with ABS plastic and manufactured in the USA. All metal parts ( except tape blade ) are stainless steel. All the tapes are assembled in Moorpark, California.  


The KP 50 Foot and 15 Meter.  Tape case is black because it is a 
prototype. Production tape cases will be burnt orange in colorThe KP 100 Foot and 30 Meter. The 50 foot /15 meter and 100foot / 30 meter side by sideThe KP Pin (prototype)KP Pin with clip attached

Measuring long distance  I am really excited about sharing my new tape measure with the world. 
With your help , I will be able to do this. I need to raise $33,000 to bring this project to life. Every single contribution will be greatly appreciated  and will make a huge difference in getting this project off the ground.

What can I do with it?

Every Day Measuring.
You can use the KP tape for your 
every day measuring. The ability of the clip and pin or lag to measure 
from a exact spot will give you an 100 percent accurate measurement 
every time. This will be a great asset when you don't have someone 
around to help you measure or if you do, they might just hold you in the wrong 
spot.  
Measure in the ground
The KP Tape is a great tool for measuring in the ground.  This task is made simple with the lag and clip. You will be able to measure from an exact spot in the ground without the fear of the tape blade moving or becoming unattached.    
Square something up with a right angle.
You can use the KP tape with the KP pins or lags to find a right 
angle. By using the KP tape for this task, your measurements will be 
extremely accurate and precise. You will be able to do this task with 
ease and without the help of another person.
The 3-4-5 rule is a great way to find a right angle because it is easy 
to remember and is extremely versatile. All though I used feet in the 
example, the 3-4-5 are actually units, which means you can use it with 
inches, feet, yards, centimeters, meters, miles and kilometers. You can 
increase the size of the right angle by multiplying each of the units by
 the same number. Example: say you pick 5 as the number. you would 
multiply 3x5=15, 4x5=20 and 5x5=25. You would have 15,20,25 as your 
units. 
Marking a perfect radius or circle.
If you want to mark a
 radius or circle, the KP tape is the tool for the job. Having the pin 
or lag stay firmly positioned in a spot and the ability of the clip to 
rotate freely, allows you to mark your radius and circle easily and 
accurately. No need for help from another person. 
Measuring off a ladder or up high.
Say you need 
to measure something that takes a ladder.  With the KP tape, you can set
 the pin, hook the clip and move to where ever you need to measure. This
 saves you from having to get someones help and a second ladder. The 
unique ability of the clip to stay hooked on the pin with no tension on 
the blade and when it's windy will save you a lot of time and  
aggravation.

The KP Story
The journey began  on September 1, 2011.  I was in the construction 
industry for 30 years and after the collapse of the housing market in 
2008, I knew it was time to move on. I have always loved building things
 and always had a ton of ideas about new products. But that's all they 
were, just ideas. On that September day I decided to act on one. The 
idea was to build a clip that would attach to a flag stick used in golf 
that would stay where you attached it but still had the ability to 
rotate 360 degrees. Like most things, easier said than done. After about 2
 months and countless designs I finally figured it out. So I built a 
prototype out of wood. 

It worked! I filed for a utility patent and started looking into 
producing the clip out of plastic. After showing the prototype to some 
friends one of them knew  a guy named Jim that made injection molds . He immediately took a interest and started 
working on how to make the clip out of plastic. After a few weeks of 
design we came up with a injection mold-able clip.  Jim  cut a prototype on his cnc machine out of a block of 
ABS plastic. We put it together and after some testing and tweaking , it was done. On to building the tape measure. I came up with a design 
and Jim again prototyped it. Put the whole thing together and tested it.
 It worked fantastic! I gave Jim the OK to build the 7 production molds needed 
while I procured the tape blades ( a story in itself). He finished 
the molds, we tested them, adjusted them and retested until we got them 
right. We took the molds to Pope Plastic in Chatsworth, Ca and ran a 
small production run of the parts. 


Anyway, along my journey, in the back of my mind, I always thought  
the tape and clip would work great in the construction industry. I started 
giving it more and more thought and came up with the idea of a short pin
 with a nail down the center that the clip could attach to. I made a 
prototype of the pin and tested it. WOW! It worked fantastic. It allowed
 me to measure things myself that before took another person to help. It
 is 100% accurate and I don't have to wonder if that other person is 
holding me in the right place. When I needed to measure something that 
takes a ladder, it used to take two people and two ladders, I can now 
measure alone with one ladder. You can even use it upside down. If you need to 
square something up , mark a radius or circle , the clip allows you to 
do this with ease and without help. Another advantage is that the clip 
stays attached even in windy conditions and doesn't require tension on 
the blade to stay attached. I then started to think about how you could measure in the ground. It 
dawned on me that a 1/2 ordinary lag screw would work perfect. I got 
one, tested it and guess what, It works fantastic.
  Risks & Challenges 
Although things can certainly go wrong unexpectedly, having been 
through the whole process with the KP golf tape from design to 
fulfillment and having my supply chain complete, I see the risk to be 
minimal. By knowing how long the process actually takes allows me to be 
confident that I will be able to fulfill the perks on time and as 
promised.
One of the challenges in creating a new product is will it actually 
work as you envisioned it. This takes time and testing. I have been 
through this process already with the golf tape and have made all the 
necessary adjustments and tested the tape extensively.

cap again.

Easy to install on
your camera strap, which is always on your camera.
- 
Lightweight, making
sure your camera is the only heavy object in your hands.

<h3>Who am I and what is a Gargoyle?</h3>
<p>My name is Rodney and I created the revolutionary Stock Gun called the Gargoyle.</p>
<p>Below is the first generation of the Gargoyle. </p>
<p style="""">There were 80 made and all sold very quickly at a retail cost of $675. Version two has many new features!</p>
<p style=""""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/973174/files/20141030195030-Gargoyle.jpg?1414723830"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""/></p>
<br/><p style=""text-align: justify;""> I created the Gargoyle to address issues that I really didn't care for when I played the game. Essentially because I was frustrated. I really disliked having to disassemble the gun for every little issue that I encountered through out a day of play. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Stressing out at the chrono station trying to get dialed in before the next game if my gun was shooting too low or too high. B<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">reaking paint inside the breach, having to change springs, or just perform routine cleaning, I just knew there was a better way. It took years of searching and a whole lot of ""NO's"" before I found a local machine shop that was willing to build the Gargoyle and the players loved it!</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">With the initial success of the Gargoyle, I continued to refine its design and now I am ready to manufacture the second generation Gargoyle. It is not only ready to get manufactured, but it also has a sister gun called the Warthog that is an open class gun as well! </span></p>

<p><b><span style=""line-height: 30px;"">What makes the Gargoyle II so different….so special?</span></b><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Gargoyle II and Warthog have numerous features that make them two of the most unique guns on the market today. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Fit and finish are very important and I strive to make these the best looking and best feeling paintball guns you can buy. However, function is just as important and that is where all the features come into play. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Both guns are designed to make you not only stand out in a crowd but also make the mundane things like spring changes, cleaning, and general maintenance hassle free and dare I say enjoyable?  </p>
<p>____________________________________________________________</p>
<p><b>The Trigger.</b><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The trigger is an all aluminum design with a Delrin nub held in place with a small screw. This provides a smooth contact point for the sear to hit releasing it from the bolt.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There are two adjustments build into the trigger. One adjustment screw is in the front to limit travel forward, and the other positioned on the triggers back side limits travel rearward.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The trigger is captured inside the Delrin trigger cartridge providing maximum lubricity for the smoothest trigger pull possible.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1387325/files/20150415221354-Trigger_Only.JPG?1429161234"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<br/>
<p>___________________________________________________________</p>
<p><b>The Trigger Cartridge.</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This piece is a delrin part that serves many purposes. The first one being the capturing of the trigger itself provided an incredibly smooth trigger pull. The trigger is captured on all sides which will eliminate any slop and give the Gargoyle II one of if not the best trigger in paintball.</p>
<p><b>The Cartridge by itself:</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1380742/files/20150413192438-Magic_Insert_reduced.png?1428978278"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<br/>
<p><b>The Cartridge installed into the Frame.</b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1380745/files/20150413192612-Frame___Trigger_Group_reduced.png?1428978372"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The next thing that the delrin cartridge does is hold the connecting rod and guide rod snugly in place to prevent side to side movement. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The two holes in the aluminum frame of the Gargoyle that the connecting rod and the guide rod pass through are slightly oversized. These rods are captured inside of the cartridge preventing them from ever rubbing the frame causing drag and unsightly wear marks.</p>
<p>Seen below as white circles.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1380775/files/20150413194247-Front_face.png?1428979367"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">And finally, the cartridge also houses a steel rod internally behind the guide rod.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">What this does is give the guide rod something (Other than the frame of the gun) to smack into at the end of your pump stroke.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Adjusting the length of your guide rod will allow you to 'time' your Gargoyles pump stroke to bottom out just after the bolt and hammer connect with each other making for a fast and crisp engagement and feel.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<div></div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Feed Tube:</h3>
<p>The feed tube on the Gargoyle is multi purpose. </p>
<p>First it holds 13 paintballs in the gun. </p>
<p>Second it holds the feed block in place when installed onto the body of the Gargoyle. </p>
<div>
<p><br/></p>

<br/>
<p></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What is the Feed Block for?</h3>
<p>The feed block directs the paintballs into the breach of the gun. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It also allows the user to gain access to their internal Bolt, main spring, and hammer. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Whether your performing a simple cleaning or changing the main spring, it's so simple it's even fun to do!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<br/>
<p>Below the video of how the bolt, main spring, hammer and valve spring are accessed on the Gargoyle I and Gargoyle II. The Warthog is essentially the same however on it the feed block lifts up and forward to gain access to the internals.</p>
<p>Simple, Clean, and Easy.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>The Body.</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Gargoyle body is a thing of beauty. Sleek and fluid lines make it one of the best looking Nelson based guns ever created. Rather than use the traditional stacked tube method for the body, RTR machines this body out of a solid block of aluminum. Doing this provides stability and unparalleled feel for the end user. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It's Auto Cocker threaded so that the user can use Auto Cocker barrels or Phantom barrels by using or not using the barrel adapter and the Gargoyles unique ability to modify the pump body with the larger diameter bushing to compensate for the larger diameter barrels.</p>
<p></p>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1387253/files/20150415214502-Body_1.JPG?1429159502"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>The Barrel Adapter.</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Barrel adapter that comes with the Gargoyle as standard allows the user to use the very quiet and accurate CCI Phantom Barrel. The adapter is Auto Cocker threaded to mate with the body of the Gargoyle and then the user would screw the CCI barrel into the adapter.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The adapter prevents roll outs of the paintballs by using three small dimples. The ID of the adapter bore is .679 with the dimples holding any undersized paintballs at and ID of .672. These are the same dimension as the first version and owners of the Gargoyle have said that this combination works just fine.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1381065/files/20150413223508-Badapters3.png?1428989708"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>The Feed Gate.</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The feed gate has a built in fail safe for ball retention. If you lose or break your traditional paintball retainer the Gargoyles feed gate has a special slot machined into it that allows the user to simply wrap a rubber band or even a string around the feed gate which will then ride inside and across the opening of the feed gate for paintball retention.</p>

<br/>
</div>
<div>
<br/>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>What is different about the RTR Valve System?</b></p>
<p>The Gargoyle valve is unique in that it allows the owner to gain access to their valve spring without taking the valve off of the gun. </p>
<p>Change your valve spring in seconds without a single tool! </p>
<p>The spring guide you see with the diagonal grooves exists because unlike a traditional Nelson valve which is solid at the end, the Gargoyles is open. This made it necessary for an internal part for the spring to butt up against. So the fancy Spring guide which also restricts CO2 flow was born. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1387246/files/20150415214012-Valve_Exploded_reduced.png?1429159212"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>What is the Pump ""Key?""</b></p>
<p>The Gargoyle features a quick change pump body that allows the user to easily remove the pump without having to unscrew the connecting rods.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1387249/files/20150415214154-Pump_Key_-_Bottom.JPG?1429159314"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<br/>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>The Pump Body.</b></p>
<p>The Gargoyle Pump is unique in that it is threaded to eccept the barrel bushing. </p>
<p>The new Gargoyle Pump has an improved design that does away with the two bushings and incorporates one long version. To do this the pump had to be slightly enlarged to allow some thickness for the bushing wall. </p>
<p>The barrel bushing allows the user to not only use the included Phantom barrel made by CCI, but also allows the use of numerous after market 1"" diameter barrels with auto-cocker threads that are so popular in todays game. </p>
<p>And now this can be done WITHOUT removing the pump body!!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1380860/files/20150413204658-Screen_Shot_2015-04-13_at_10.51.58_PM.png?1428983218"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>The Barrel Bushing.</b></p>
<p>The barrel bushing as seen below is a one piece threaded delrin insert that comes in two sizes. </p>
<p>One is machined to allow the standard CCI Phantom barrel which comes standard with each Gargoyle.</p>
<p>The other available barrel bushing is for barrels with that have that 1"" outer diameter and use auto-cocker threads.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1387288/files/20150415215824-Pump_Bushing.JPG?1429160304"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>The new Bucket Changer.</b></p>
<p>The Gargoyle and the Warthog will boast a new and improved bucket changer. It not only looks awesome but now has some really cool functionality built in. Even with these additional features built in, I was careful and was able to come up with a design that keeps the same overall length as in the original. </p>
<p>First. At the bottom of the bucket itself you will notice there is a threaded part that has a hex cut into the bottom. This provides the user the ability to adjust for unusually sized 12 grams by rotating them up or down.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1380821/files/20150413203012-Bucket_and_Skeleton.png?1428982212"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<p>Second. The piercing pin is now a robust threaded pin that will not break and is easily removed if needed.</p>
<p>Third. This piercing pin pushes down onto the internal 12 gram seal which is now fully captured inside the ASA making it impossible to fall out even when it gets frozen from dumping CO2.</p>
<p>And lastly the piercing pin is a built in self contained check valve. Inside the pin will be a rubber ball that is pushed into place with a spring.</p>
<p>The piercing pin is threaded on the inside which allows a plug to be installed to hold the spring and the rubber ball in position. </p>
<p>Unlike the model below, there will be standard O-Ring seal on the ASA neck.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1381010/files/20150413220246-ASA7.png?1428987766"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>The Pistol Grip.</b></p>
<p>The pistol grip was redesigned so that the users hand feels a nice smooth transition from the grip where it meets the frame. No longer are there the two little nubs that can make your hand hurt after a long day of play.</p>
<p>The screw that holds that valve body in place is captured inside the frame! </p>
<p>What that means is you can take off your valve body and the screw cannot drop to the ground on you. </p>
<p></p>

<p>The Warthog is an open class pump gun that retains numerous feature of the Gargoyle. All of the abilities to get to your internals easily remains.</p>
<p>The trigger, grip frame, valve, are the same.</p>
<p>The Warthog bucket changer retains all of its function but has been redesigned to have a better appearance on the Warthog.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>SO WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THE WARTHOG?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>The Body.</b></p>

</div></div>","Who am I and what is a Gargoyle?
My name is Rodney and I created the revolutionary Stock Gun called the Gargoyle.
Below is the first generation of the Gargoyle. 
There were 80 made and all sold very quickly at a retail cost of $675. Version two has many new features!

 I created the Gargoyle to address issues that I really didn't care for when I played the game. Essentially because I was frustrated. I really disliked having to disassemble the gun for every little issue that I encountered through out a day of play. 
Stressing out at the chrono station trying to get dialed in before the next game if my gun was shooting too low or too high. Breaking paint inside the breach, having to change springs, or just perform routine cleaning, I just knew there was a better way. It took years of searching and a whole lot of ""NO's"" before I found a local machine shop that was willing to build the Gargoyle and the players loved it!
With the initial success of the Gargoyle, I continued to refine its design and now I am ready to manufacture the second generation Gargoyle. It is not only ready to get manufactured, but it also has a sister gun called the Warthog that is an open class gun as well! 
Once you contribute you can qualify for our Referral Based Prizes! You must be logged into your IndieGoGo account and using IndieGoGo's share tools so you can track your referrals. You can track your referrals by looking into your IndieGoGo Profile. It's fun and easy. 


 Let's make these the first paintball guns to ever have been crowd funded!
The Gargoyle II:






The Warthog:


What is the money that is raised used for?



Provide the funding to cover the initial design work
Provide the funding for prototyping before mass production
Provide funding for production
Provide funding for polishing and anodizing
Assembly of the guns
Shipping material and shipping costs

What makes the Gargoyle II so different….so special?
The Gargoyle II and Warthog have numerous features that make them two of the most unique guns on the market today. 
Fit and finish are very important and I strive to make these the best looking and best feeling paintball guns you can buy. However, function is just as important and that is where all the features come into play. 
Both guns are designed to make you not only stand out in a crowd but also make the mundane things like spring changes, cleaning, and general maintenance hassle free and dare I say enjoyable?  
____________________________________________________________
The Trigger.
The trigger is an all aluminum design with a Delrin nub held in place with a small screw. This provides a smooth contact point for the sear to hit releasing it from the bolt.
There are two adjustments build into the trigger. One adjustment screw is in the front to limit travel forward, and the other positioned on the triggers back side limits travel rearward.
The trigger is captured inside the Delrin trigger cartridge providing maximum lubricity for the smoothest trigger pull possible.









___________________________________________________________
The Trigger Cartridge.
This piece is a delrin part that serves many purposes. The first one being the capturing of the trigger itself provided an incredibly smooth trigger pull. The trigger is captured on all sides which will eliminate any slop and give the Gargoyle II one of if not the best trigger in paintball.
The Cartridge by itself:



The Cartridge, Trigger, and rods with the Pump Key.




The Cartridge installed into the Frame.




The next thing that the delrin cartridge does is hold the connecting rod and guide rod snugly in place to prevent side to side movement. 
The two holes in the aluminum frame of the Gargoyle that the connecting rod and the guide rod pass through are slightly oversized. These rods are captured inside of the cartridge preventing them from ever rubbing the frame causing drag and unsightly wear marks.
Seen below as white circles.




And finally, the cartridge also houses a steel rod internally behind the guide rod.
What this does is give the guide rod something (Other than the frame of the gun) to smack into at the end of your pump stroke.
Adjusting the length of your guide rod will allow you to 'time' your Gargoyles pump stroke to bottom out just after the bolt and hammer connect with each other making for a fast and crisp engagement and feel.



The Feed Tube:
The feed tube on the Gargoyle is multi purpose. 
First it holds 13 paintballs in the gun. 
Second it holds the feed block in place when installed onto the body of the Gargoyle. 








What is the Feed Block for?
The feed block directs the paintballs into the breach of the gun. 
It also allows the user to gain access to their internal Bolt, main spring, and hammer. 
Whether your performing a simple cleaning or changing the main spring, it's so simple it's even fun to do!




In the image below, the Bolt and Barrel Adapter have been removed to show how the body mounts onto the frame. If the Barrel Adapter were to be installed it would ride over the main screw seen in the image.



Below the video of how the bolt, main spring, hammer and valve spring are accessed on the Gargoyle I and Gargoyle II. The Warthog is essentially the same however on it the feed block lifts up and forward to gain access to the internals.
Simple, Clean, and Easy. 

The Body.
The Gargoyle body is a thing of beauty. Sleek and fluid lines make it one of the best looking Nelson based guns ever created. Rather than use the traditional stacked tube method for the body, RTR machines this body out of a solid block of aluminum. Doing this provides stability and unparalleled feel for the end user. 
It's Auto Cocker threaded so that the user can use Auto Cocker barrels or Phantom barrels by using or not using the barrel adapter and the Gargoyles unique ability to modify the pump body with the larger diameter bushing to compensate for the larger diameter barrels.






The Barrel Adapter.
The Barrel adapter that comes with the Gargoyle as standard allows the user to use the very quiet and accurate CCI Phantom Barrel. The adapter is Auto Cocker threaded to mate with the body of the Gargoyle and then the user would screw the CCI barrel into the adapter.
The adapter prevents roll outs of the paintballs by using three small dimples. The ID of the adapter bore is .679 with the dimples holding any undersized paintballs at and ID of .672. These are the same dimension as the first version and owners of the Gargoyle have said that this combination works just fine.



The Feed Gate.
The feed gate has a built in fail safe for ball retention. If you lose or break your traditional paintball retainer the Gargoyles feed gate has a special slot machined into it that allows the user to simply wrap a rubber band or even a string around the feed gate which will then ride inside and across the opening of the feed gate for paintball retention.










What is different about the RTR Valve System?
The Gargoyle valve is unique in that it allows the owner to gain access to their valve spring without taking the valve off of the gun. 
Change your valve spring in seconds without a single tool! 
The spring guide you see with the diagonal grooves exists because unlike a traditional Nelson valve which is solid at the end, the Gargoyles is open. This made it necessary for an internal part for the spring to butt up against. So the fancy Spring guide which also restricts CO2 flow was born. 




What is the Pump ""Key?""
The Gargoyle features a quick change pump body that allows the user to easily remove the pump without having to unscrew the connecting rods.







The Pump Body.
The Gargoyle Pump is unique in that it is threaded to eccept the barrel bushing. 
The new Gargoyle Pump has an improved design that does away with the two bushings and incorporates one long version. To do this the pump had to be slightly enlarged to allow some thickness for the bushing wall. 
The barrel bushing allows the user to not only use the included Phantom barrel made by CCI, but also allows the use of numerous after market 1"" diameter barrels with auto-cocker threads that are so popular in todays game. 
And now this can be done WITHOUT removing the pump body!!



The Barrel Bushing.
The barrel bushing as seen below is a one piece threaded delrin insert that comes in two sizes. 
One is machined to allow the standard CCI Phantom barrel which comes standard with each Gargoyle.
The other available barrel bushing is for barrels with that have that 1"" outer diameter and use auto-cocker threads.





The new Bucket Changer.
The Gargoyle and the Warthog will boast a new and improved bucket changer. It not only looks awesome but now has some really cool functionality built in. Even with these additional features built in, I was careful and was able to come up with a design that keeps the same overall length as in the original. 
First. At the bottom of the bucket itself you will notice there is a threaded part that has a hex cut into the bottom. This provides the user the ability to adjust for unusually sized 12 grams by rotating them up or down.






Second. The piercing pin is now a robust threaded pin that will not break and is easily removed if needed.
Third. This piercing pin pushes down onto the internal 12 gram seal which is now fully captured inside the ASA making it impossible to fall out even when it gets frozen from dumping CO2.
And lastly the piercing pin is a built in self contained check valve. Inside the pin will be a rubber ball that is pushed into place with a spring.
The piercing pin is threaded on the inside which allows a plug to be installed to hold the spring and the rubber ball in position. 
Unlike the model below, there will be standard O-Ring seal on the ASA neck.


The Pistol Grip.
The pistol grip was redesigned so that the users hand feels a nice smooth transition from the grip where it meets the frame. No longer are there the two little nubs that can make your hand hurt after a long day of play.
The screw that holds that valve body in place is captured inside the frame! 
What that means is you can take off your valve body and the screw cannot drop to the ground on you. 



The Warthog.





The Warthog is an open class pump gun that retains numerous feature of the Gargoyle. All of the abilities to get to your internals easily remains.
The trigger, grip frame, valve, are the same.
The Warthog bucket changer retains all of its function but has been redesigned to have a better appearance on the Warthog.
SO WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THE WARTHOG?
The Body.

The Warthog body has a flip up feed block that allows quick and easy access to the guns internals.




The feed block is fixed at the front with a stainless threaded pin.This allows the feed block to be rotated up and forward when the locking rods are withdrawn. 
The feed neck is designed to receive your typical aftermarket feed clamp.







The Barrel
The Warthog will have an RTR designed custom barrel. 








The Locking RodsThe locking rods are what keeps the Feed Block securely in place. They do not push on the Feed Block but merely hold it in place much like the Feed Tube on the Gargoyles.



To open the Feed Block all you need to do is operate the wheel at the rear of the gun. A few rotations one way and the rods engage the Feed Block, and few rotations the other way the rods will retract back out of the Feed Block.




The wheel is captured and rotates smoothly because of precision and the use of a teflon washer on both sides of the wheel. It maintains centered because of the rod assembly moving forward and backward and it's also rotating in a pocket on the inside of the rear plate.
Here you can see the Teflon washer on the front side:

Here you can see the Teflon washer on the back side. The rod at the center of the below image rotates inside the back plate (which has been removed in this image) can also be seen:
Here is an image of the wheel having been removed. Inside you can see the piece that the wheel will move forward or rearward when the wheel is rotated which pushes or pulls the rods in or out of the feed block.And with the plate invisible to show how it all works:
Here is an image of the other side of the rods which fit inside of the feed block.These will be rounded off on the production run.

The Bucket Changer
The Warthogs bucket changer keeps all the goodness of the Gargoyle II's but changes its appearance to mate better with the Warthogs aggressive styling. In this rendering there is a pattern that represents knurling which will be present on the Warthog Bucket changer.

The Pump Key
Unfortunately some of you will ask ""Is it the same as the other key?""
Short answer is no. I just couldn't fit everything needed using that one.
You will notice that the Main Guide Rod has a gap between it and the Key.
This is because, like the connecting rod and smaller guide rod, it too has a slippery Delrin Bushing!

Below is what the bushing looks like without the pump key visible.
And with just the Key...

With the explanation of the Warthog it is important to remember all of the features that it shares with the Gargoyle. 
It will be arguably the most user friendly open class pump gun ever built!

The Impact


The first generation Gargoyle took over 10 years to develop and manufacture. All that work made for a very functional and exciting new paintball gun. This current effort will fund the development and refinement of the new Gargoyle and I cannot stress enough that any and all funding is vital to the success of the campaign.

And for those who may have missed out, below is a link to the blog that showed weekly progress during the evolution of the first Gargoyles. I'm looking forward to making another one!


GARGOYLE VERSION #1



As the gallery tab at the top of this page will show, the customers that were able to get there hands on one of the first generation Gargoyles could not be happier. There was nothing more saddening to me than to get the weekly emails and forum private messages asking when new Gargoyles would be made. I had created a successful product that I could no longer make available for the players.  

Things that I want for you. 
I want you to be able to clean your gun easily and quickly. I want you to be able to change all of your springs with ease. I want you to own a gun that has so much functionality it never lets you down.
To never miss a game because it took too long to clean your gun. 
To never miss a game because it took too long to adjust your gun.
I want the younger player to walk up to you and say ""Wow! What is that?""
I'd like you to blow their mind and let them use your gun for a game!
I want you to play a part in this successful history making effort! 
  Risks & Challenges 
As I've said, it took years to get the Gargoyle manufactured. My efforts never waned in the face of adversity and I did everything possible to see it through. Having said that, your support of this project should come without worry and the knowledge that I don't quit until it's done!

<h3>Why We Are Here</h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">Howdy, <br/><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">My name is Zachary Kraner, I am a graphic designer living in Toledo, Ohio. My love for sunglasses began during my senior year in art school. We were tasked with re branding a company. One of my teachers suggested rebranding RayBan. After living, breathing, and dreaming about sunglasses for a semester, I was hooked.</span><br/></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-4883fe01-754f-2e75-dc65-07cf071ef928""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">One thing that literally drives me crazy about the sunglasses market today is the cost. These markups and perceived brand choices are just an illusion. In December of 2013 a few friends and I started Intrinsic Made. Intrinsic Made is an indie apparel brand offering low cost, high quality sunglasses, hand screen printed shirts and posters, and handmade infinity scarves.</span><br/><br/>Being an artist, I know how hard it is to get your name and work out there. The market has been tested with our first style of sunglasses, and we are now ready to move on to the next step. We would like to create Artist Print Sunglasses. These will be limited edition, signed and numbered shades. In addition to the sunglasses and some awesome packaging, we want to have artists design shirts, posters, and other swag  to create a collection. <br/><br/>In doing this approach we will be offering a way for artists, designers, and illustrators a way to get their work on to a new platform, make some money, and ultimately, get more marketing.<br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I really believe that these sunglasses will open up a great opportunity</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> for many artists to get their work out in front of people, and by doing so will create an actual unique choice of what people put on their face.<br/></span><br/>Thank you for your time, I hope you enjoy!<br/><br/>- Zachary Kraner</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Intrinsic Made is a purely passion run company. There have been no loans, no investors thus far, and we hope to keep it that way. In order for these Artist Print Sunglasses to be manufactured we need your help, by selecting a perk listed on the right hand side of this page you are essentially pre-ordering a pair of these sunglasses. We have also listed other great perks such as shirts, posters, stickers, and shout outs. </span></p>
<p><span><span> </span></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>We currently need to raise $2,000 to manufacture the glasses, cover shipping, taxes, and the IndieGoGo fees. </span></p>

<p>These Artist Print Sunglasses are the same great Squint sunglasses we offer now, just with a little something extra. Our Sunglasses are made with a highly durable Polycarbonate plastic and 100%UV protection, FDA shatter resistant lenses. These Artist Print Edition will also feature a mirrored revo coating and plorization layer on the lenses to add a crystal clear shine, and maximum viewing clearity.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-4883fe01-755f-9b16-b146-99e7b24eaab5""><br/><span>Not only are these Orange/Red Revo Coat lenses better, the entire frame of the sunglasses will be printed with Zach’s custom hand drawn design. The design will be applied with a high-quality water transfer method similar to screen printing. This is the same quality and standards as the fancy pants brands without the incredibly high mark up price.<br/></span></span></p>

Howdy, My name is Zachary Kraner, I am a graphic designer living in Toledo, Ohio. My love for sunglasses began during my senior year in art school. We were tasked with re branding a company. One of my teachers suggested rebranding RayBan. After living, breathing, and dreaming about sunglasses for a semester, I was hooked.
One thing that literally drives me crazy about the sunglasses market today is the cost. These markups and perceived brand choices are just an illusion. In December of 2013 a few friends and I started Intrinsic Made. Intrinsic Made is an indie apparel brand offering low cost, high quality sunglasses, hand screen printed shirts and posters, and handmade infinity scarves.Being an artist, I know how hard it is to get your name and work out there. The market has been tested with our first style of sunglasses, and we are now ready to move on to the next step. We would like to create Artist Print Sunglasses. These will be limited edition, signed and numbered shades. In addition to the sunglasses and some awesome packaging, we want to have artists design shirts, posters, and other swag  to create a collection. In doing this approach we will be offering a way for artists, designers, and illustrators a way to get their work on to a new platform, make some money, and ultimately, get more marketing.
I really believe that these sunglasses will open up a great opportunity for many artists to get their work out in front of people, and by doing so will create an actual unique choice of what people put on their face.Thank you for your time, I hope you enjoy!- Zachary Kraner



What We Need & What You Get
Intrinsic Made is a purely passion run company. There have been no loans, no investors thus far, and we hope to keep it that way. In order for these Artist Print Sunglasses to be manufactured we need your help, by selecting a perk listed on the right hand side of this page you are essentially pre-ordering a pair of these sunglasses. We have also listed other great perks such as shirts, posters, stickers, and shout outs. 
 
We currently need to raise $2,000 to manufacture the glasses, cover shipping, taxes, and the IndieGoGo fees. 
 
The Sunglasses:













These Artist Print Sunglasses are the same great Squint sunglasses we offer now, just with a little something extra. Our Sunglasses are made with a highly durable Polycarbonate plastic and 100%UV protection, FDA shatter resistant lenses. These Artist Print Edition will also feature a mirrored revo coating and plorization layer on the lenses to add a crystal clear shine, and maximum viewing clearity.
Not only are these Orange/Red Revo Coat lenses better, the entire frame of the sunglasses will be printed with Zach’s custom hand drawn design. The design will be applied with a high-quality water transfer method similar to screen printing. This is the same quality and standards as the fancy pants brands without the incredibly high mark up price.

Sunglass Case Concept:


Shirt Concepts:
Each shirt will be hand screen printed in Toledo, Ohio at our Intrinsic Made HQ. The two options below feature silver metallic water based ink on 100% preshrunk combed ringspun cotton shirts. 





Stickers & Decals:




In the event that the $2,000 goal is not reached, IndieGoGo will refund your full perk amount. This is an all or nothing funding platform. Really, it is a win win for you. You either great an awesome pair of shades, or you get your money back.

<p>OBELISC : Simple &amp; Automatic </p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The world's most simple automatic watch. We are 2 founders who are enthusiastic about industrial design, with a gusto for minimalism and automatic movement.  <br/></span></p>
<p>The objective is to make a simple watch enriched with the privilege of automatic movement that you can own at an affordable price. Underneath its simplicity, this watch carries a complex mechanism which transforms into a highly sophisticated self-winding system. Enable the watch to run on itself as a result of natural motion of the 
wearer's arm, making manual winding or battery replacement unnecessary. </p>
<p>A watch movement which only found in luxury watches and expensive timepieces.<br/></p>
<p>
</p>The name Obelisc is inspired by obelisk, an icon symbolizing the most fundamental and ancient time measuring system, the sun dial.<br/><br/><p>To achieve the goal, we sincerely need your pledge and support. Big or small perks mean a lot to us. <br/><br/></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">We need to raise a minimum of $50,000 to bring this project to life! We are keeping the cost low without compromising on quality. Most of the funding will go to the scratch-proof sapphire crystal glass, Japanese automatic movement, 316L steel case, genuine leather strap and specially-designed hands that distinguish it from the rest. <br/><br/>What you'll get in return for your pledge and support is a beautifully simple automatic watch of the highest quality.<br/></span><br/>We'll also throw in a FREE brown leather strap when we hit the USD 70,000 mark, and a FREE watch pouch for every USD100,000 collected. </div> <div>

<br/>The Impact

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We love minimal watches. We also love automatic movement. We decided to put them together and are amazed with the product! To strive for minimal design, we have to say no to many yeses. At the end, we've decided to keep only the main function of a watch - which is to tell time, day and date. This results in a clean approach by hiding the complexity of a luxurious automatic movement beneath its simplicity.<br/></span></p>

The world's most simple automatic watch. We are 2 founders who are enthusiastic about industrial design, with a gusto for minimalism and automatic movement.  
The objective is to make a simple watch enriched with the privilege of automatic movement that you can own at an affordable price. Underneath its simplicity, this watch carries a complex mechanism which transforms into a highly sophisticated self-winding system. Enable the watch to run on itself as a result of natural motion of the 
wearer's arm, making manual winding or battery replacement unnecessary. 
A watch movement which only found in luxury watches and expensive timepieces.

The name Obelisc is inspired by obelisk, an icon symbolizing the most fundamental and ancient time measuring system, the sun dial.To achieve the goal, we sincerely need your pledge and support. Big or small perks mean a lot to us. 
  How do i get this watch? It's only USD199 now!

What We Need & What You'll Get
We need to raise a minimum of $50,000 to bring this project to life! We are keeping the cost low without compromising on quality. Most of the funding will go to the scratch-proof sapphire crystal glass, Japanese automatic movement, 316L steel case, genuine leather strap and specially-designed hands that distinguish it from the rest. What you'll get in return for your pledge and support is a beautifully simple automatic watch of the highest quality.We'll also throw in a FREE brown leather strap when we hit the USD 70,000 mark, and a FREE watch pouch for every USD100,000 collected.  


You will not be charged if this project does not reach the required amount of fund.


The Impact

We love minimal watches. We also love automatic movement. We decided to put them together and are amazed with the product! To strive for minimal design, we have to say no to many yeses. At the end, we've decided to keep only the main function of a watch - which is to tell time, day and date. This results in a clean approach by hiding the complexity of a luxurious automatic movement beneath its simplicity.

Timeline
Quality can't be rushed. Therefore, the time required to produce this watch might take longer than usual. The production period is estimated to be approximately 2 months, with an extra month for thorough quality check on each watch. You can refer to the graph below for a clearer understanding of the production process.

We will keep you posted on the progress from time to time.




Risks & Challenges
The simplest design is the hardest to do. This is because simplicity comes from sifting through the complexities, and deducting what's unnecessary. The end result: a beautifully simple automatic watch. Just for you.As this is our first project in Indiegogo, we spent a lot of time studying successful projects and learned what needs to be done when met with unpredictable circumstances. If there is any obstacles, we hope you will be patient with us as we do our best to overcome the challenges. We appreciate your understanding.

<p>Everyone seems to have one – that ratty black sweater sitting on the car seat, or hanging on the back of the chair at work, or carried around in the bag for a “just in case” moment.  And then there is that clumsy Snuggie – widely distributed and shamefully worn!</p>
<p> Women of the universe deserve a better look and a stylish solution!   We need a movement to free the world of these unsightly garments.  Surely there must be something out there more stylish and more chic?        </p>
<p> On a cool summer night in 2011, Chicagoland neighbors Kathy Brosmith and Marcia Hischke were wearing Snuggies on a lakeside dock with a group of friends. They found it difficult to get up or to reach for anything because of the clumsiness of the Snuggie!  The conversation led to how awkward, ugly, and impractical the Snuggie is.  All the women on that lakeside dock admitted to owning an “Ugly Black Sweater”.  The group decided that these products were totally humiliating.  It was agreed that women everywhere need an accessory to enhance their outfit while being stylish, fashion forward and functional – indoors as well as outdoors.  The <strong>KOEZY</strong> idea was born! </p>

<p> Kathy and Marcia decided to create a fashion statement that could be proudly worn in public yet comfortable and cozy, stylish and chic – unlike the ratty sweater or the Snuggie.  Their search was fruitless. No other women’s product  had the features they needed and wanted.  They both agreed <strong>KOEZY </strong>is the answer!  </p>
<p> </p>

<p>KOEZY’s right-weight micro fleece fabric provides cozy warmth in a wide range of temperatures.  KOEZY is long-sleeved, has an adjustable closure, fits into any lifestyle and transitions easily from inside wear to outside wear.  KOEZY can be layered over an existing outfit, adding more style.  This timeless garment is lightweight, wrinkle free, washable, and reasonably priced.</p>

<p>KOEZY is available in four sizes in wearable neutrals with a splash of color: Blissful Black (with a turquoise closure), Charming Camel and Irresistible Ivory (both with a tortoiseshell closure). </p>

<h1><em>INDIEGOGO SUPPORT</em></h1>
<p>Indiegogo support is needed to continue the journey.  Indiegogo support will allow women of the world to liberate themselves from ratty black sweaters and clumsy Snuggies!   The founders' personal savings and fading 401k’s have been the sole financial support so far.  More is needed.</p>
<p> KOEZY has proven itself at trade shows and consumer shows.  It clearly is a viable new product that women want and need.  Now is the time to ramp up sales, increase advertising and expand the brand by adding new colors in 2013. </p>
<p> To do that, we're requesting (okay we're BEGGING) an initial grant of $5,000. We will use that money to increase manufacturing goals to increase our inventory to meet the high sales demand we anticipate.  If we exceed our goal, we'll be able to expand the line with new colors for the 2013 fashion collection.</p>
<p>Have you heard the shocking report?? 1 out of 12 US households has a Snuggie?  KOEZY's ambitious target: match those numbers in the US and beyond...with Kickstarter's help.  With your support, one out of every 12 women in the universe will be wearing KOEZY!!</p>
<p>Women of the world need KOEZY.  New styles, colors, designs are in the future.  Please help us move KOEZY into 2013 and beyond.</p>

Plastic contamination, unfair clothes productions and boring running apparel have grown from topics to problems for conscious runners.
The Running Republic and its outstanding products made of recycled polyester and polyamide are the solution. 

The Running Republic® is the athletic brand for the millennial Eco Runner.
Wearing The Running Republic® is shouting loud that a different world, more sustainable and more ethical is possible, and all with an outstanding product, because sustainability and fairness can be very cool! 

Technical garments, outstanding graphic design and our sustainable DNA are just some of the great features of our brand.

<p>It's a simple code:</p>
<p>We live hard; Fight hard; Drink hard. And it doesn't matter if our buddy is stumbling, puking, or just talking too much. We ensure that they get home,s o we can do it all again tomorrow.</p>
<p>We are the Drunken Warrior Project and we are dedicated to everyone getting home safely...after a night out of fun. We believe that where you wake up should be as common as any other night. Safely in your bed...possibly covered in your own vomit or excrement. But hey, you do you. We are your battle buddy at your best and especially your worst. Remember when you though that the Korean Elvis statue was giving you attitude? We were there to make sure you only threw one punch before taking you to medical to get your bones set. Remember your rendition of ""Don't Stop Believing"" that had everyone at the karaoke bar complementing you for? We were there to make sure it was all captured on video so all your peers can enjoy it. Remember when you thought it was a great idea to go jumping into that city river and that the floating needles on the surface wasn't a problem? We were the ones who fished you out of there and explained to the police that you just happened to fall in after taking off your clothes in a fluke accident.</p>
<p>This is the shirt that says, ""We'll be there for you. We are the Drunken Warriors and we are at each other sides through it all."" As Drunken Warriors, we are dedicated to ensuring that everyone returns home safely, hassle free, and most importantly, ready to have another great night.</p>

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>If you made it here, you may know that I'm the creator of the, loosely, Navy comic strip, ""15 Turns to Nowhere"". After spending a third of my life in the military, I decided to start telling stories and observations, in comic strip form, that relate to and jog the memories of those that serve or the families of those. During the past 4 years of making the strip, I have dabbled into trying to find a marketable item. </p>
<p>I've always wanted to make something tangible. Something that you guys would proudly display. I've gone back and forth between shirts and posters and stickers, but nothing stuck. A lot of this had to do with trying to sell a product I knew nothing about. So I reached out to Ranger Up to help me make this shirts, as it's a brand that I follow and almost wear exclusively. By ordering these shirts from them, I know the quality that will everyone get and I know that it will last through frequent wear.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>It's simple, I just want you to pre-order a shirt. If enough of you do this, then I will send off this design to get made and we'll ship them off to you. I have to meet a minimum order, so I will make this an all or nothing. If enough people contribute to this campaign, you'll get a shirt. If not enough people love me, then you'll get your money back. Also, if we triple my goal, I'll get a sticker made that all backers will get without any additional charge.</p>

The US government routinely collects information about Internet users’ online behavior, and content owners can compel ISPs to collect and share information about users' online activities without any proof of harm.

<p>As security expert Bruce Schneier described recently in <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/nsa-how-to-remain-secure-surveillance"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this article</a> in The Guardian, the best thing you can do to protect your privacy is “hide in the network” by anonymizing your online activities and encrypting your communications with open-source software. Don’t Snoop Me Bro provides these capabilities in the DSMB Tunnel, an inexpensive, easy to use appliance that requires no configuration and is activated by the turn of a key.</p>
<p>Virtual Private Networks are a network security technology that has been in use for over fifteen years. When you use a VPN, an encrypted link is established between a local endpoint in (or near) your computer and a remote server. Your traffic is encrypted and routed through this link, protecting the content as well as information about its origin.  VPNs are widely used, especially by businesses, to allow employees to securely access their company network when traveling or working from home. More recently, consumer VPN services have become available. These are used to provide encrypted connections to a server in the Internet rather than a company network.</p>

<p></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p>But VPN services -- even ones targeted at consumers -- can be challenging to configure, putting privacy out of reach for non-technical users.  That’s how the idea for the DSMB Tunnel was born: we wanted to make a device that would establish an on-demand VPN tunnel with no user setup.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/114904/files/20131005145604-privacy_without-01.png?1381010164"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The DSMB Tunnel is a small device that sits between your computer and Internet router using an Ethernet cable.  By placing the device between your Internet router and ISP modem you can protect all the traffic associated with your ISP account.  When you turn it on, it automatically establishes a prepaid VPN connection with a destination server in the country of your choosing.  Our goal was simplicity, and we made a network appliance with the most straightforward interface we could come up with: to protect your network, simply turn the key on the front of the device. There’s no software to install, no firewall to configure.</span></p>

<p></p></span><p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">When the key is turned to ‘on’, the light on the front turns green and all of your traffic travels through an encrypted tunnel to a VPN server in the country of your choice.  When your traffic reaches the VPN server, it is decrypted and forwarded to its destination carrying the address assigned by the VPN service as the sender’s network address.  The unecrypted traffic no longer has the network address assigned by your ISP, removing traceable links to you or your ISP account.  </span></p>
<p>Traveling through the VPN adds a small delay when the Tunnel is ‘on’.  However, we’ve verified that we can watch streaming videos and surf the web just fine.  Nevertheless, for latency-sensitive applications like gaming, we recommend that you turn your Tunnel to ‘off’. When it’s ‘off’, the Tunnel is invisible on your network and there is no added delay. And, to protect users further, if the VPN service fails while the switch is in the secure ‘on’ position, traffic is blocked so that you will never unintentionally send out sensitive traffic without protection.</p>

<p><strong><i>What is ""Nataly's crafts""?</i></strong><br/>Nataly's crafts is a developing brand in Lithuania. This brand was established relatively long time ago in December 2016. Every jewelry is made with love and painstakingly. I hope that my crafts will hape people feel special everyday.</p>
<p><i><strong>Wat makes ""Nataly's crafts"" special? </strong></i><br/>All Nataly's crafts are created by individual design. Every jewelry is unique and almost impossible to duplicate. Most of crafts are made from natural stones.</p>

<p><strong><u>About me:</u></strong></p>
<p>I started making my first handcrafts in 8th grade at school. Every year I tried to learn new crafting technique. Everything started with simple works made of beads. Later I began to use wool, decoupage. My first works were crafted as gifts to my friends, parents, relatives. I began posting my works on facebook and then received first orders from acquaintances.  People usually presented my craft as gifts for Christmas, birthdays and other events. At that moment I decided to start my own business. In 2016 I was actively promoting my brand. I launched facebook page “Nataly’s Crafts”. In March 2017 I first time participated in our national fair and by now I have more than 2000 followers on facebook. Currently I am studying masters in economics and I am very happy that my hobby is becoming a real business. Every day I fell more and more passion about my crafts.</p>

Their signature reflective messages (ReflectNow) are powerful affirmations for those wearing them and those who see them! With little reminders to be present, love fearlessly and breathe, my kevala tops stay in high rotation!  The most amazing thing about kevala, however is the creator behind them. The founder volunteered in each of the 50 states and gives back a percentage of kevala sales to each and every one of them. We are beyond inspired and grateful to partner with someone on such an amazing concept."" <span><br/></span><i>-Jenn B.

Real reviews from fitness studio owners, athletes, boutiques, and fashionistas who love our fabrics, give-back program, and the ReflectNow series! 

Washington, D.C. ""We love kevala - the story alone: giving back to nonprofits, affirmations to inspire, and sustainable athletic wear - something our customers are now asking for…everybody loves the feel of the tops, and kevala is my favorite tank to work-out in! Once restocked - we want to do the blank program with our logos!"" -Ferrall D. (Core72 Owner - Fitness Boutique)
San Diego, California ""As someone who has worked in and around the sustainable fashion sphere for over 8 years, kevala is one of those standout brands who has quickly built a cult following of conscious and active humans. Whether it's their materials, supply chain or giving arm, kevala does not sacrifice on style or ethics. The leadership and purely positive energy that their founder Keith brings to the table is all inspiring and has helped build a community of mindful consumers. kevala is a brand to watch and a brand I continue to learn from."" -Kestrel J. (AWEAR CEO - Sustainable Fashion Company) 
Dallas, Texas""It's great to work with great people. Not only is kevala made with earth friendly products but they feel amazing inside and out. Their signature reflective messages (ReflectNow) are powerful affirmations for those wearing them and those who see them! With little reminders to be present, love fearlessly and breathe, my kevala tops stay in high rotation!  The most amazing thing about kevala, however is the creator behind them. The founder volunteered in each of the 50 states and gives back a percentage of kevala sales to each and every one of them. We are beyond inspired and grateful to partner with someone on such an amazing concept."" -Jenn B. (Yoga Digest Magazine CEO - Global Yoga Publication)Mission Valley, California ""I had the pleasure of meeting Keith (founder of kevala) when I dropped in on a yoga class in San Diego. After class he told me about kevala and I was immediately touched by his endeavor; I just had to be involved. I started attending more kevala Yoga Crawl classes because Keith brings such a great energy and always inspires me to help. In the short time I have known Keith I have witnessed the traits of a giving, caring, and dedicated individual.""-Aubry W. (International Yoga Instructor) 
Seattle, Washington ""Having had the chance to run, do body-pump and yoga in my new racerback ReflectNow top, I couldn't be happier. I was surprised at how nice and soft it is -- I love it now! And I love the positive feedback loop it helps create.""-Lauren M. (kevala Customer - Runner, Crossfitter, & Yogi)

<h3><strong>About this project</strong></h3>
<p>Before reading more about our project please think about this words:</p>
<p><strong><em>Radiation is something you can't</em></strong><strong> <em>feel</em>, <em>smell</em> or tast<em>e!</em> </strong></p>
<p>A Geiger counter, also called a Geiger–Müller counter, is a type of particle detector that measures ionizing radiation. They detect the emission of nuclear radiation: alpha particles, beta particles or gamma rays. A Geiger counter detects radiation by ionization produced in a low-pressure gas in a Geiger–Müller tube. Each particle detected produces a pulse of current, but the Geiger counter cannot distinguish the energy of the source particles. Invented in 1908, Geiger counters remain popular instruments used for measurements in health, physics, industry, geology and other fields, because they can be made with simple electronic circuits.A geiger is not a device you need every day, but if nowdays, every one should have one.</p>
<p><em>The only problem is, that geigers counters using a GM Tube are still very expensive. Our goal is to offer an affordable device, but which is also precise, user friendly and nice designed, and all this for a price below 100 USD and this is why we need your pledge.</em></p>
<h3>
<strong><em>We need your help to make it affordable for any one in the world.</em></strong><strong></strong>

<p>The engineering and development stage is complete. The final step before entering mass production is to reach the factory’s minimum order quantity and to get enough money to start a mold, pay the calibration and meet factory's min. order quantity, and<strong> this is where you can help us get there.</strong></p>

<p>When the Marketing Management team(Kuba, Kornel, Sasa) comes with a crazy idea and delivers it to a passionate Multimedia Designer(Susanna) that listens to the vision proposed by the Service Management team(Lenka, Bianca, Majky) fire starts and imagination becomes reality.</p>
<p>Our Backpack is build from 4 exchangeable parts that are compatible with each other. First of them is what we call canvas and its the biggest piece of the backpack. The second comes the bottom of the backpack and right after them the arms and the front pocket. All parts will come in different colors and materials what allows you the ultimate fun and uniqueness of your product at all times.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our 12 000 $ is going to be spend partially for finalizing the prototype and establishing the first stock of backpacks after finding suitable supplier.</p>
<p>For every funding above 50$ you going to be presented with the opportunity to create your own and very first Odd Mode backpack as soon as production starts and before the essential launch of it! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Even though we focus mainly on giving you the ability to be unique every day of your special life, we do have other reasons for you to choose our backpack!</p>
<p>Between 1990 and 2004, the global demand for textiles increased by nearly 20 million tons . The production of textiles to reach these demands has contributed to increasing CO2 emissions, water usage, and toxic chemical use. As a point of comparison, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by the average yearly textile consumption of one person in Denmark is equivalent to pollution generated by traveling 2,143 km by car! That is where we started to look for a helpful solution. Our backpack helps reduce this waste by prolonging its life cycle with exchangeable parts and reducing textile waste in our production.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge that our product will face in future is finding the right supplier for our exchangeable parts</p>
<p>There is always an aspect that this is our team first attempt to launch a product and we learn about our challenges everyday... but we learn quick!</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

Between 1990 and 2004, the global demand for textiles increased by nearly 20 million tons . The production of textiles to reach these demands has contributed to increasing CO2 emissions, water usage, and toxic chemical use. As a point of comparison, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by the average yearly textile consumption of one person in Denmark is equivalent to pollution generated by traveling 2,143 km by car! That is where we started to look for a helpful solution. Our backpack helps reduce this waste by prolonging its life cycle with exchangeable parts and reducing textile waste in our production.

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge that our product will face in future is finding the right supplier for our exchangeable parts
There is always an aspect that this is our team first attempt to launch a product and we learn about our challenges everyday... but we learn quick!

<p><span><em>(Preview of the Specials you can purchase in the Armory)</em><br/><br/>Unlike traditional top-down arcade shooters, <strong>ZED</strong> features a large arsenal of weapons you can equip and modify before you enter the arena. <strong>ZED</strong> can carry up to 4 into battle, and they can easily be quick-swapped when you find yourself in trouble.

<h3>OST (Official Sountrack)</h3>

The OST is being composed by <span>Дмитрий Демиденко - Dimitry Demidenko.

<h3>
<br/>Occulus Rift Support!</h3>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>A lot of people are excited, while a lot of others are confused as to how we plan on implementing the Oculus rift into our game experience. Since we don’t have one yet, and haven’t been able to definitively measure the pros and cons of different implementations, the general idea is that you will have control of what you, and ZED, are looking at. We are both very excited about the Oculus rift so I guarantee it will be getting a good amount of attention on this end.</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>That's great! Who are you?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We have 20 years combined experience in Design &amp; Production of games, web, mobile, and video. That said, there are only 2 of us. It has been a labor of love for gaming and great game experiences, and hopefully one you will be able to share with us. Because there are only two of us, you probably already know the answer to the question below: </p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Why are you fundraising?</h3>
<p></p>
<p><span>To be honest, <strong>ZED</strong> will be released no matter what. We have dedicated countless hours and nights to developing this game, so come hell or high water, this game will be completed. That said, this funding will make that happen in a timely manner, and get additional features that we simply can’t tackle without more resources. </span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We launched <strong>ZED</strong> on Steam Greenlight October 2012 and found that there was an overall love for the style of game we are trying to build. We have been taking everything the community has had to say about it and are constantly making it better. We're hoping to find the support and community involvement to make this project a success, not only in our eyes, but to you the end user. So what will the funding go towards? We want to be 100% transparent with what these funds will be used for. There are a few things that we must cover in some way, so these items will take priority:</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><em>Rewards for backers</em></li>
<li><em>Software licensing costs</em></li>
<li><em>Server costs for multiplayer and player management</em></li>
<li><em>Once these costs are covered, we will be using our successful funding for the following:</em></li>
<li><em>SFX and soundtrack development</em></li>
<li><em>3D modeling and animation support</em></li>
<li><em>Additional programming &amp; server support</em></li>
<li><em>Platform licensing costs</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>We have been thinking about Stretch Goals as well. We have a rough outline of things we would like to implement into the game. We are basing what comes first on campaign funding and community voting. These are subject to change.</p>
<p><em><em> </em></em></p>
<p><em><em><img alt=""goals"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/472/084/757a92bcb1c6a8290d187c47f7a59931_large.jpg?1364339803"" src="""" style=""""/></em></em></p>
<p><em><em> </em></em></p>

<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>We've tried to do as much as we can to show the community how dedicated we are at what we do. We both love making games and aside from the possibility of not fulfilling our Indie Gogo Campaign, we would still find some way of finishing it on our own.</p>
<p>Working with contractors can sometimes be difficult with Time Zones and project management. Luckily we have both experience in studio environments as well as working from home, learning some of the best tricks to successful projects, like running daily scrum.</p>
<p>If we don't make our goal we are set to fixed funding. Which means if we don't raise our entire goal all the funds will be refunded to the backers registered on I/G.</p>

The Story (So Far...)
Meet ZED - a battle hardened seraphim warrior. Banished from the holy land, ZED vies for his salvation the only way that’s left; by competing in the Tournament of the Accord. Possessing the corpses of fallen kin, he must survive the brutal gauntlet, and work his way through progressively challenging and terrifying realms. Only by collecting the souls of the damned can he earn his way back into the Gods good graces. ZED’s only chance at redemption is to defeat the soldiers of Legion, but he is not left to his own devices. Build a massive arsenal, wield unique powers, and give special blessings to ZED’s armor in order to help him reclaim absolution.





Sounds great! What's next?
ZED takes elements from many styles of gameplay and melds them into a one of kind experience. At first glance, ZED is a top down throwback arcade shooter in the same vein as Robotron 2048 and SmashTV - albeit brought into the 21st century. But ZED has many layers beyond classics such as these, and brings many elements of gameplay you find in RPG, ISO, and FPS games. A few noticeable features of ZED include:

Multi-Platform Support 
Multiple Breathtaking 3D environments to battle Legion through

A massive arsenal of equippable weapons and upgrades 
Multiple unique special powers and armor blessings 
Balanced Difficulties for new to experienced players
A full leveling system for players and weapons 
Oculus Rift Support (OMG HOW)

Since we don’t have one yet, and haven’t been able to definitively measure the pros and cons of different implementations, the general idea is that you will have control of what you, and ZED, are looking at. We are both very excited about the Oculus rift so I guarantee it will be getting a good amount of attention on this end.

 


That's great! Who are you?



We have 20 years combined experience in Design & Production of games, web, mobile, and video. That said, there are only 2 of us. It has been a labor of love for gaming and great game experiences, and hopefully one you will be able to share with us. Because there are only two of us, you probably already know the answer to the question below: 

 
 


Why are you fundraising?

To be honest, ZED will be released no matter what. We have dedicated countless hours and nights to developing this game, so come hell or high water, this game will be completed. That said, this funding will make that happen in a timely manner, and get additional features that we simply can’t tackle without more resources. 
 


We launched ZED on Steam Greenlight October 2012 and found that there was an overall love for the style of game we are trying to build. We have been taking everything the community has had to say about it and are constantly making it better. We're hoping to find the support and community involvement to make this project a success, not only in our eyes, but to you the end user. So what will the funding go towards? We want to be 100% transparent with what these funds will be used for. There are a few things that we must cover in some way, so these items will take priority:

 





Rewards for backers
Software licensing costs
Server costs for multiplayer and player management
Once these costs are covered, we will be using our successful funding for the following:
SFX and soundtrack development
3D modeling and animation support
Additional programming & server support
Platform licensing costs



 
We have been thinking about Stretch Goals as well. We have a rough outline of things we would like to implement into the game. We are basing what comes first on campaign funding and community voting. These are subject to change.
 

 
What do I get out of this?
Not only will you get an amazing gaming experience, we are offering the following rewards:BETA ACCESS (Digital Item)To show our support we are offering any backer who pledges 15$ or above a limited Beta Access key that will come available on Desura. This is different from our global multiplayer. You will be added to a list to get the entire full game beta before launch!IN GAME VISUAL HELM (Digital Item)An awesome way to show your support!

 
OST DOWNLOAD (Digital Item)A digital link to download the OST when the game launches.

FACTION T-SHIRTS Physical Item)We have faction T-Shirts available sizes range from S-XXXL.
FACTION DOG TAGS (Physical Item)Rep your faction of choice or collect both, ILLINARI and LEGION.(Physical Item)Each mini poster is signed and sent with love.COLLECTIBLE CARDS (Physical Item)Gotta collect them all!GAME AND DEVELOPER DIARY PACK (Physical Item)Game and Developer Diary BookABSOLUTE EDITION COLLECTORS BOX (Physical Item)Everything we have to offer, and then some.
-------
Can we help other ways?
The next best way to help ZED which is just as helpful as monetary backing is social sharing. Please follow us on Twitter and Like us on Facebook if you use any of these social platforms and pass them along to friends or family :)
We could use your Vote! If you are a Steam user please take a moment and check out our official Steam Greenlight page.
That's all for now folks!, Thank you for your support! 
Risks and Challenges
We've tried to do as much as we can to show the community how dedicated we are at what we do. We both love making games and aside from the possibility of not fulfilling our Indie Gogo Campaign, we would still find some way of finishing it on our own.
Working with contractors can sometimes be difficult with Time Zones and project management. Luckily we have both experience in studio environments as well as working from home, learning some of the best tricks to successful projects, like running daily scrum.
If we don't make our goal we are set to fixed funding. Which means if we don't raise our entire goal all the funds will be refunded to the backers registered on I/G.",31.0,0,"2 Campaigns

My dream is to inspire kids and their parents around the world to be aware of the sun and reducing the risk of skin cancer. I came up with the idea at the beach watching parents having trouble telling their kids why sunscreen is so important. A lot of kids simply do not like the rubbing and takes of. This means, that the kids often do not have sunscreen on at all - or the coverage is very poor. That is NOT good at all. Smaller children's skin is extremely delicate compared to adults. By making it fun and visible I wish that most kids will find it exciting to do as the monsters tells them - and by that, saving a lot of children from getting skin cancer when they get older. How do these UV wristbands work?Good question. The SUNsters wristbands is a fun toy that reacts to UV-rays. When the sun hits the bracelet, the color changes and the SUNsters ""lights up"" to tell that it is time to enter the shade or maybe put on some sunscreen. Why are they called SUNsters?Yes you are right. The name is a mix of SUN and MONSTERS. A great family of small sun-monsters that loves children and will do anything to protect them from the sun. Are they harmful to health?No, not in any way. The wristbands are made of natural silicone which have been CE approved. This means that bracelets comply with all legal requirements for CE marking. Please note: If you know that your kids suffers from other kinds of skin allergies, please be aware that this might include allergy towards silicone. What will the money be used for? We have joined Indiegogo to make SUNsters a worldwide success. For every dollar we get, we will invest 90% in marketing/sales and free products for kids and the remaining 10% will be donated to amazing people that creates great events for kids with cancer.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

(standing for Sapphire Craft) and designed the “Transparency N°1”, our goal was to construct the watch in such a way that the wearer could observe the movement parts and interactions with as unobstructed a view as possible.Quand nous avons créé la montre S.Craft (pour Saphir Craft) et dessiné la ""Transparency N ° 1"", l’objectif était de de fabriquer une montre de telle sorte que son utilisateur puisse observer les parties du mouvement et les interactions avec une vision la plus dégagée possible.Sapphire caseThe timepiece features a solid sapphire 40mm case that has been carefully machined from a single block of sapphire crystal. The aim, of course, is to offer full visual access to the multi-level movement, from all possible angles.Sapphire (known in mineralogical circles as Corundum) is the third hardest material on Earth, only moissanite (9.25) and diamonds (10) exceed its hardness ranking (9) on the Mohs scale.It is almost entirely scratch-proof, and the process by which it is made into a finished watch case is extraordinarily difficult. For watchmakers, creating a case from a block of sapphire is a true technical challenge.It requires long and complex machining, grinding and polishing processes, and superior expertise.La montre dispose d’un boîtier entièrement en saphir d’un diamètre de 40 mm de diamètre qui a été soigneusement usiné à partir d’un seul bloc de saphir. Le but est bien entendu d’offrir un accès visuel complet aux différents niveaux du mouvement sous tous les angles possibles.Le saphir (connu dans le milieu minéralogique sous le nom de corindon) est le troisième matériau le plus dur sur Terre, seuls la moissanite (9,25) et le diamant (10) dépassent son classement de dureté (9) sur l’échelle de Mohs.Il est presque entièrement résistant aux rayures et le processus par lequel il est transformé en boîtier de montre fini est extrêmement compliqué.Pour les horlogers, créer un boîtier à partir d’un bloc de saphir est un véritable défi technique.Cela nécessite des processus d’usinage, de meulage et de polissage longs et complexes que seul les plus expérimentés et talentueux arrivent à faire.Skeletonized movementThe eye-catching heart of this watch is the skeletonized automatic ETA movement 2892-A2, which carries a power reserve of approximately 42hours and is beyond any doubts, one of the most reliable and trouble-free movements in the industry.This movement beats at 28’800 BPH (beats per hour) 4Hz and itis decorated with polished steel screws. It has undergone extensive skeletonizing thus reducing the bridges and main plate to a minimal see-through framework.The same goes for the rotor which is opened like the rest of the movement to allow a clear view of the wheels and pinions interacting.Le cœur de cette montre Suisse est le mouvement ETA 2892-A2 à remontage automatique que nous avons squelettisé, qui possède une réserve de marche typique d’environ 42 heures et est sans nulle doute, l’un des mouvements les plus fiables de l’industrie horlogère.Ce mouvement bat à 28’800 BPH (battements par heure) 4Hz et il est décoré de vis en acier poli. Il a subi une squelettisation extensive, réduisant ainsi les ponts et la platine au maximum permettant le plus de transparences possible. Il en va de même pour la masse oscillante qui est découpée comme le reste du mouvement ce qui permet une vision claire des roues et des pignons en interaction.Dial & BandThe movement seats beneath the skeletonized dial displaying the hours with blue indexes and the minutes with blue markers.The band is purposely not made using any endangered or exotic species but rather using top grain cowhide leather with crocodile pattern embossing.The band also features “quick-click” spring bars so the band can be easily changed (a second band color is available in the gift box with each watch).Le mouvement est positionné sous le cadran, lui aussi, squelettisé affichant des indexes bleus pour les heures ainsi que la minuterie qui est aussi bleue.Le bracelet n’a volontairement pas été fait avec des peaux d’espèces en voie de disparition ou exotiques mais en utilisant du cuir de vachette pleine fleur avec un motif gaufré style crocodile.Le bracelet est également doté d’une barrette à ressort «clic rapide» afin que le bracelet puisse être facilement changé sans outils (un second bracelet de couleur différente est disponible dans l’étui avec chaque montre).Gift boxThe S.Craft “Transparency N°1” is delivered in a gift box with a second band and a magnifying glass allowing the owner to better see all the details of the skeletonized movement from any angle.La montre S.Craft «Transparency 1» est livrée dans un étui qui comprend un second bracelet ainsi qu’une loupe permettant au propriétaire de mieux voir tous les détails du mouvement squelettisé sous n'importe quel angle.Technical detailsCASEDiameter: 40 mmMaterial: scratch-resistant polished sapphire crystalMiddle part case: scratch-resistant polished sapphire crystalBezel: scratch-resistant polished sapphire crystalBack cover: scratch-resistant polished sapphire crystalWaterproofness: 30 meters (100 feet), 3 ATMMOVEMENTCaliber ETA 2892-A2 Skeletonized mechanical movement with self-winding bidirectional rotorTime setting with stop-secondFrequency 28’800 vibrations per hour (4 Hz), 21 jewels, shock absorber incablocRegulator system ETACHRONFunctions hours, minutes and central second.Typical power reserve of approximately 50 hoursDIALSkeletonized silver color with brushed finishingBlue hour indexes with blue minute markersBlue HandsBANDTop grain cowhide leather with crocodile pattern embossingTool-free “quick-click” spring barsStainless steel prong buckleSHIPPINGFree shipping and insurance (excluding import duty and eventual local taxes), delivery estimated 5 months after order.WORLDWIDE MRSPThe worldwide MRSP (manufacturer retail suggested price) is CHF 12’000.-INCLUDING INTERNATIONAL GUARANTEE OF 5 YEARSBOÎTIERDiamètre : 40 mmMatériau : Saphir poli résistant aux chocsCarrure : Saphir poli résistant aux chocsLunette : Saphir poli résistant aux chocsFond : Saphir poli résistant aux chocsÉtanchéité : 30 mètres (100 feet), 3ATMMOUVEMENTCalibre ETA 2892-A2 automatique squelettisé avec masse oscillante bidirectionnelleMise à l’heure avec stop secondFréquence 28’800 vibrations par heure (4 Hz), 21 rubis, amortisseur de chocs incablocRaquette ETACHRONFonctions heures, minutes et seconde au centreRéserve de marche typique: 50 heuresCADRANCouleur argent squelettisé brosséIndexes des heures bleus avec minuterie bleueAiguilles bleuesBRACELETCuir de veau pleine fleur avec motif style crocodileBarrette à ressorts “clic rapide” sans besoin d’outilBoucle en acier avec ardillonEXPÉDITIONLes frais d’expédition et d’assurance dans le monde entier sont gratuites (excluant les taxes d’importation et éventuelle taxe locale)PSDFLe PSDF (prix de détail suggéré par le fabricant) mondial est de CHF 12'000.- GARANTIE INTERNATIONALE DE 5 ANS INCLUSE The premises of the projectWe started by the artistic design :Then we did CAD drawings for the proportions and engineering of the various elements :They were followed by the technical drawings :Which then lead to the final look developed in 3D :We then produced the first physical samples of the different components of the watch for testing and quality control purposes :And finally, there it is, the finished working sample that we use to run all the quality and final testing on the watch!Nous avons commencé par le dessin artistique Ensuite nous avons fait les dessins CAO pour l’ingénierie et les proportions de tous les élémentsSuivi des dessins techniquesQui nous a amené au look final développé en 3DNous avons ensuite fabriqué les différents composants de la montre afin de les tester ainsi que les différents tests de qualitéPour finir, voici, la montre fonctionnelle terminée que nous avons utilisée pour faire tous les différents tests finaux de qualité.Campaign goals and planningThe campaign ended but the watch is still available at CHF 12’000. -

</div></div>","The XR is a stylish, easy to use key holder, made to organize and consolidate up to four keys in a single place. Its innovative design helps eliminates clutter, noise, and other hassles associated with regular keychains.



DESIGN. After many trial and errors we finally decided on a design which focused on ease of use and comfort. No sharp edges or rough corners. The XR simply feels good in your hand.


Shaped to ""feel good"" in the palm of your hand.

Slotted end for better thumb grip.




Designed for one hand operation, the XR allows you to browse through your keys with just a few finger movements while leaving your other hand free.


DURABLE. Made from 6061 T6 aircraft-grade aluminum, the XR is carefully cnc-machined from a solid aluminum block to its final design. Upon inspection, the XR makes its way to the anodizing tanks to get its final protective coating and color.





MULTI-FUNCTION. The XR can also have multiple uses besides a key holder, It can also be used as a hex bit driver in case of emergency. Simply remove the bottom screw to expose the hex opening, insert your hex bit, and turn!




COLOR OPTIONS. This key holder will be available in 4 anodized colors: Blue, Black, Red, and Silver.

<br/><h3>More About BareBands</h3>
<p>I've been working on BareBands for two years now. It all started one fateful night—the night before I was set to compete in the NYC Triathlon. As luck would have it, my watch band broke just when I needed it most. In a pinch, I grabbed two bright green rubber bands off some broccoli I had in the fridge, attached them to my watch face, and, voila, I had a watch to compete in. People instantly loved the way the bright color of the bands “popped” but was still subtle. I decided to take this concept and develop the watch for real when it occurred to me that not only could BareBands tap into everyone’s desire to add a little color and self-expression through their accessories, but it could also be a means to support the causes people care about in a unique and functional way. I too was over the engravable, semi-stretchy wristband. Working with my design partner, <a href=""http://www.ruxdesign.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Rux Design</a>, we’ve built BareBands: the coolest, most customizable watch on the market.</p>
<p>Watch me explain how the watch came to be in a segment I did for Fox Business Network.</p>

For example, if you buy a pink watch to support the fight against breast cancer, a to-be-determined portion of your watch cost will go to that charity. The same would be true for a blue watch to raise awareness about prostate cancer, and so on. Or, using tools we are planning to integrate into our site with funds from this campaign, you can build your own custom watch to support your own cause/community/team. </p>
<p>Or, maybe you just want to pick the coolest watch you can find. No sweat. Even when you’re not picking a charity, we’ll pick one for you. BareBands will be designating a portion of all profits to BareBands.org, a charity we’re establishing to support efforts geared towards eradicating infectious disease via wearable technology.</p>
<h3>So Why Do We Need Your Support?</h3>
<p>First of all, personalization. Not only do we need to make the bands in a wide range of sizes to make sure the watch fits nice and snug on your wrist, but we want to roll out technology through which you can customize every aspect of the watch.  Unfortunately, enabling all that customization costs money.</p>
<p>Second, there’s the issue of MOQ. If you took a second to watch my video, you got to see some great shots of the test run of the very same watch you can buy today. But for me to be able to sell these watches to you, I need to fulfill a “Minimum Order Quantity.” In my case, in order to buy one watch, I need to buy 3,000. </p>
<p>“Hold up. Did you say I can get the very same watch I saw in the video?” Yes, and as soon as mid-July. That’s just in time for you to rock your new watch on the beach, at the bar, a BBQ, pool party, music festival…all summer long. </p>

It should...
be a companion for any occasion,
feature an adaptable design, 
fit all age groups,
be worn by male and female watch lovers equally,
be made of high quality materials (10 year warranty)
and be sold at a fair price.
But most important, it should feature a continuous design, one that would stay untouched by trends and fashion over time. A design for 100 years.Never go out of style anymore!We wanted to create a design that lasts for a century.A truely timeless, versatile design that would fit in the 21st century and would last at least for 100 years. So we teamed up with jewellery experts, researching throughout the past and comparing the styles of various wrist watches. As the fashion trends always changed over time, we were on the lookout for continuous design features that would never grow old.The result is the Century Watch, combined with the nordic touch of our brand Aaron Vinley. A luxury watch for under 100€. Never go out of style anymore!After developing the Century Watch design it was time for relentless prototyping. So we teamed up with world leading suppliers and manufacturers to produce parts and assemble prototypes. After constructing various prototypes, the final version matched our high quality standards and completed all durability and quality checks successfully.After finishing the prototyping process we partnered directly with some of the world's leading watch manufacturers with decades of professional experience. This way we can reassure that you will receive the highest product quality at affordable manufacturing costs. Proofing this, we will back every watch with a 10 year warranty.Genuine Italian LeatherA genuine soft leather strap in various (interchangeable) colors fits to any occasion. These straps give the Century Watch a classic and luxurious finish.We have further colors available. Interchangeable StrapsOne of the most important features of the Century Watch is the adaptable design. Besides providing a wide collection of different color themes you can choose from, we implemented interchangeable straps to the Century Watch.

 

Traditional ways involve various middlemen standing in between the product and the customer. By using a disruptive, direct-to-consumer model we cut out distributors, wholesalers and retail stores.Furthermore traditional brands artificially inflate the price by high marketing expenditures and mark ups. At Aaron Vinley, we do things differently.This way, by avoiding all the middlemen and minimizing artificial expenditures and mark ups, we can offer you the Century Watch for an acceptable price.Besides having its versatile and timeless design, a 'Century Watch' should be made of the best quality components.On the other hand it should have a competitive price to make it accessible to everyone. We combined the two keeping durability and practicability in mind. As Aaron Vinley is a brand that was born on a trip throughout Scandinavia, we dedicated the Century Watch to the most beautiful cities of Scandinavia. Catching the diversity of the simplistic and truthful lifestyle of the Nordics. Here is our Century Watch collection:Constructed by King Christian from 1670 to 1673 Nyhavn was the most important gateway into the buzzling city of Copenhagen for cargo, fisherman and travellers. Today it attracts tourists from all over the world as the towns historic landmark and is a meetingpoint for the laid back people of Copenhagen. This is the Copenhagen series:

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Our Story.</h3>
<p>It all started when my first gifted leather bag broke after a year and half, it was pricey and felt shattered at how weak it was. You expect to use an expensive leather bag at least for some years. In quest for new bag which is inexpensive and also durable looked around but was frustrated with the price tag.</p>
<p>And it is how I went about looking for a solution to producing a bag which is both durable and inexpensive, thinking there may be more like me going through the same frustration.</p>
<p><strong>Our aim is to make every professional and business men/ women happy without costing them a fortune.</strong></p>
<p>We took enough time to design a bag that is spacious, durable and fits the professionals and business travelers need, looks stylish and luxurious, but fits within their limited budget, and that can be carried on a daily basis.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Compliments Every outfit.</span></strong></p>
<p>This bag is cross body and classic messenger style briefcase which makes it perfect for the majority of outfit. The dark brown colored leather adds a squeeze of retro appeal to your overall contemporary look whether it’s a formal wear or a Friday casual wear, blends well with your personality.</p>

If you pledge for genuine leather bag, you stay away from fungal attacks, dust mites and dry abrasion. It is durable and everlasting if properly cared for. You may find it expensive when compared with synthetic bag, but is a long lasting piece of grace and elegance.
What benefits?


Durability: It is resistant to harsh weather condition and will not peel off or crack and due to this, there is a negligible chance that it will get damaged or torn unless damaged forcefully.

Everlasting: Sophistication and classiness that it offers. And will remain trendy forever.

Elegance: It will add a touch of style to your personality. Elegance of leather is a plus. If you have a business or corporate meeting, accessorize your look with leather satchel.

Resistant: On our leather bag it is unlikely to attract dust mites or fungus and makes it safe for you to carry at any corporate events or for daily use.

Eco-friendly: Being a natural fabric, no chemical is used in the creation, therefore, unlike synthetic leather satchels, these cause no skin rashes. And since leather is considered to be biodegradable it won’t harm the environment in any way.

Maintainance: Easy to clean and maintain. Time to time sponging and polishing is enough to maintain its look.

Keep your things organized and within reach at the time when you need the most.

Our Story.
It all started when my first gifted leather bag broke after a year and half, it was pricey and felt shattered at how weak it was. You expect to use an expensive leather bag at least for some years. In quest for new bag which is inexpensive and also durable looked around but was frustrated with the price tag.
And it is how I went about looking for a solution to producing a bag which is both durable and inexpensive, thinking there may be more like me going through the same frustration.
Our aim is to make every professional and business men/ women happy without costing them a fortune.
We took enough time to design a bag that is spacious, durable and fits the professionals and business travelers need, looks stylish and luxurious, but fits within their limited budget, and that can be carried on a daily basis.
 
Compliments Every outfit.
This bag is cross body and classic messenger style briefcase which makes it perfect for the majority of outfit. The dark brown colored leather adds a squeeze of retro appeal to your overall contemporary look whether it’s a formal wear or a Friday casual wear, blends well with your personality.

Hi , I'm Isabel Voigt, founder of Poyen, we've been with you 6 years since we were born like Poyen in Chile, time has flown by, like many things we've been through, I will not lie, it was not easy but not going down the wings and make me want to move them harder to reach more people and show them the world if you can improve by changing little things
  We live in a highly industrialized world, it seems that machines can do everything for us, and we have forgotten the true meaning of things, I want to show them that technology more beautiful, productive and efficient is another, are the hands of a woman


We have created a community of women who have sustainable income for their families, women who because of their age, geographical location or family, illness of their children, or simply not have good opportunities in their lives need to work from home.

And we produce cute and designed hats, with the excellent quality that a community of women workers can generate, a revolutionary model, where we are the excuse for a greater good.
 We created a revolutionary model that demonstrates that there is another way, a much better way

We want to be the means to provide work for thousands of women who cannot  work outside the home, and we give you well designed products , contribute a bit to the world and  will provide all the protection and shelter with a unique design and functional.
We have flown this last time by trying to show the world what we do and we have had very good results, however we compete with rock-bottom prices, labor exploitation results in distant countries against which it is almost impossible to compete.
 Almost, because I believe that if you can change the world with small and great contributions.

 Many of the problems we as a society can be improved by empowering more women, a mother.

 We need to strengthen our concept in Chile, helping more women and also reach countries where they need us, to design summer collections, show them and establish distribution points in North America and Europe to not  increase in shipments  our products, and keep our project in time,


So increasing the number of women working to earn a living that would otherwise be impossible, and only with your help I can do it.We have these first 38 days to show the world who support US, and so they have the confidence to believe in US too so we can start this revolution

It is fast, remove them about 10 minutes of your time, but for our team will be extremely valuable, but contribute the least, for us is very important.

I (Tsvetan) have spent the last 10 years studying and working in England, The Netherlands, and Germany. I've always lived in houses with hardwood, tile, or stone floors and honestly these get cold not only in winter. I always bought some random slippers until I realized that something more special will be much nicer to wear. I then shared the idea with Rumen and he decided to help me in this enterprise. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/>We then chose to start the project in the town of Sliven for a few reasons - this is where the industrial revolution in Bulgaria started (I'm an engineer and I like this stuff) and the first ever factory in the country was making textile. Seems like the perfect place for the Rompi, right? Today Sliven is a small town with high unemployment rate and we would like to help as much as we can - if we are successful our designer will train some local people, so that they can help in manufacturing and ultimately benefit from the project.</p>

No questions have been asked so far.
</div></div>","What is Rompi?Rompi are handmade slippers that focus on high quality, craftsmanship, design, historical background and ultimately on functionality - providing comfort and warmth for anyone wearing them. They come in two styles - Rompi High and Rompi Low, respectively for men and women. They also are available in six different colors of textured lambswool. The thick wool is not only very warm, but it also shapes to your feet with time, so the longer you wear your Rompi, the better they will feel :)


Who are we and why are we making slippers?
Tsvetan is a design engineer, working in the automotive industry (the German one at the moment). He is a car enthusiast, a passionate skier and has a developed a vocation for independent projects - they are fun, they are meaningful, and allow for plenty of creativity.
Rumen is still a high school student, who is a keen basketball player and will soon join higher education where he wants to pursue business studies. He comes with dozens of fresh ideas about the project (including the name Rompi).
Why slippers? I (Tsvetan) have spent the last 10 years studying and working in England, The Netherlands, and Germany. I've always lived in houses with hardwood, tile, or stone floors and honestly these get cold not only in winter. I always bought some random slippers until I realized that something more special will be much nicer to wear. I then shared the idea with Rumen and he decided to help me in this enterprise. 
We then chose to start the project in the town of Sliven for a few reasons - this is where the industrial revolution in Bulgaria started (I'm an engineer and I like this stuff) and the first ever factory in the country was making textile. Seems like the perfect place for the Rompi, right? Today Sliven is a small town with high unemployment rate and we would like to help as much as we can - if we are successful our designer will train some local people, so that they can help in manufacturing and ultimately benefit from the project.





Why are Rompi special?
Rompi slippers are an exclusive product, developed with passion, care about the detail and the community. They are made using a traditional sewing machine, traditional cut-out methods, and wool by lambs from the Stara Planina mountain in Bulgaria, which was woven and colored in a family ran factory in Sliven.
The traditional manufacturing methods, combined with the low volumes that can be achieved ensure immense attention to detail and superb quality control.
Every single pair of Rompi that will be shipped to you will be personally inspected by their designer and by us and no compromises will be made. 



Rompi's Styles

The Rompi slippers come in two distinctive styles. To avoid any confusion we gave them the evident, simple names Rompi High and Rompi Low. Both styles are available in any of the six colors that we have selected - blue, brown, beige, natural, orange, and pink. They are all woven in a fish-bone pattern (the natural is not colored, so there is no distinctive pattern there).
Click on the videos below to see a preview of the colors that we have and 360 degree views of the two distinctive styles.




Why do we need your support?

We need your support in order to finance a limited production of Rompi. We need a minimum funding in order to purchase the wool fabric (there is a minimum length of fabric per colour that we can order). Besides that we need to purchase additional sewing machines and to train personnel to allow us for smoother process, so that we can meet the set deadlines.
At last, a successful project will help us build the confidence that we need in order to turn the Rompi into a brand specializing in woolen home-wear .



Risks and Challenges

We have spent significant time on the development of this project, successfully creating the first six sample pairs of Rompi (and they are perfectly functional as far as comfort, warmth, and robustness go). This proved to us that our concept is working fine, that our suppliers are reliable and trustworthy, and that our manufacturing and quality control are excellent (handmade is the best ;) ).
We decided to launch our project on Indiegogo to reduce the financial risk for us and because such a platform seems like the perfect place for a start up like this.
The risks that we see in this campaign, although reduced as much as possible by us, are the possible delays on the supplier chain. This is wool and then weaving and coloring it. However the factory that we work with typically has a buffer stack up of supplies, so we do not think that we will have any problems.
The other risk is shipment. We will ship your Rompi (free of charge to any point in the world) using a tracked international postage. Although post services are generally reliable, there still is a chance of delays. This unfortunately is beyond our control.
We want to be as punctual as possible and if any delays arise, we will inform our backers asap. Our aim throughout the project will be to keep you well informed and to answer any questions you might have quickly and accurately.

<h3>Bad Wolf Outfitters &amp; The Pandora Carryall: A Short Summary</h3>
<h1>What It Is...</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Pandora Carryall, with all its features and function, is outfitted to be the leading example in digital survival in this technical age. For every possible daily obstacle, the Pandora Carryall comes equipped with a highly technological (and covert) solution. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/72415/files/20130913123039-INDIEGOGO.png?1379100639"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>To prevent unexpected power downs, our carryall comes equipped with a back-up battery and a solar panel to revive fading electronics.</li>
<li>USB ports and a complimentary thumb drive store back-up data and connect to your gadgets to prevent loss of important work. </li>
<li>An audio jack hooks up to speakers and can be activated via Bluetooth for impromptu office parties or an after-work dance session.</li>
<li>A screen installed inside the bag gives the user information on battery life, data storage, and audio.</li>
<li>And a bluetooth locator dongle on the bag lets the owner locate it from their smartphone, in case its location is forgotten after a long night of networking.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to function, The Pandora Carryall will be miles ahead of its competitors in form and design.</p>
<p>Because The Pandora Carryall is still in the prototypical phase of production, Bad Wolf Outfitters is offering backers an opportunity to not only fund The Pandora Carryall, but to customize your ideal carryall. </p>

<p><b>Sitting Down With The Pandora Carryall's Creators: Joey DeLoach and Ryan Dawson</b></p>
<h4>J:<span style=""font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.45em;"">""Ryan and I were both born adventurers. Neither of us are ever satisfied with our immediate environment, and finding the proper tools to keep up with such a lifestyle is very difficult. I bike everywhere I go, and subsequently need an awesome bag to keep with those demands as well.""</span>
</h4>
<h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">R:""The idea for The Pandora was born out of an almost annoyance. Joey and I were tired of buying things that were cool but not nearly as cool as they could be.  We're both from a paramedic background so we are big on multi-functional things - that is, if it doesn't have at least 2 uses it not worth carrying. Joey is a bike messenger now and I'm  a geek/yogi - all of which share common ground in the venn-diagram of needing a bag like The Pandora Carryall.""</span></h4>
<h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> J:""When Ryan first brought up the topic, I was ecstatic. No bag has ever met the standards set by my lifestyle. Now was the chance to make that perfect bag to be my personal ""MacGuyver"". Really when I think of the potential of this bag, I think of Batman's utility belt. It has to function as a mobile home base. When you're constantly moving and don't have time to return home for the essentials, is your bag going to be there for you?""</span></h4>
<h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">J:""All of the options in this bag are for surviving in our modern world. Whether it be hiking, climbing, biking, or even something as simple carrying what is required of you at your job. This bag is born of necessity, and I hope it fills all the needs of people who need such a thing in their lives.""</span></h4>

<p>In our search for manufacturers, we are looking for optimal production and distribution times. This is something that we are still engaged in doing.

<p>We may find as we go into production of The Pandora Carryall, that certain aspects of the carryall's unique features may take more time to put together.

Hopefully by prototyping our first round we will be able to iron out any production issues from the get-go. </p>
<h3>The Reality:</h3>

Bad Wolf Outfitters & The Pandora Carryall: A Short Summary
What It Is...

The Pandora Carryall, with all its features and function, is outfitted to be the leading example in digital survival in this technical age. For every possible daily obstacle, the Pandora Carryall comes equipped with a highly technological (and covert) solution. 




To prevent unexpected power downs, our carryall comes equipped with a back-up battery and a solar panel to revive fading electronics.
USB ports and a complimentary thumb drive store back-up data and connect to your gadgets to prevent loss of important work. 
An audio jack hooks up to speakers and can be activated via Bluetooth for impromptu office parties or an after-work dance session.
A screen installed inside the bag gives the user information on battery life, data storage, and audio.
And a bluetooth locator dongle on the bag lets the owner locate it from their smartphone, in case its location is forgotten after a long night of networking.

In addition to function, The Pandora Carryall will be miles ahead of its competitors in form and design.
Because The Pandora Carryall is still in the prototypical phase of production, Bad Wolf Outfitters is offering backers an opportunity to not only fund The Pandora Carryall, but to customize your ideal carryall. 
 “We cannot stress enough how much we want feedback from backers and potential users in order to make The Pandora Carryall the highest quality and most ideal “smart” satchel.” -Rebecca Chappell, The Pandora  Carryall Project Manager 
Visit www.badwolfoutfitters.com and take the survey to help impact the future of The Pandora Carryall, and help us reach the first round of funding today.Currently, we have invested in the initial design phases with our engineer and we are in the process of selecting a manufacturer. The project needs to raise a minimum of $25,000 before Bad Wolf Outfitters can begin manufacturing The Pandora Carryall. 


Who We Are ...
Bad Wolf Outfitters is the production team of Bad Wolf Syndicate, a social media marketing and campaign consulting company. Bad Wolf Outfitters is comprised of a great team of techies, Walking-Dead fanatics, fashionistas, adventures, writers, designers, dog-lovers, festival goers and brainy creative folk. 
Our goal is to provide gear for the urban explorer. We know what this technical age and digital world is like in both its positive aspects and the negative. This is why the diverse and creative group at Bad Wolf want to find solutions for these technical tragedies and inconveniences. We'll find the solution so you can be the better explorer, mathlete, barista, drummer, or Batman you ought to be.

Sitting Down With The Pandora Carryall's Creators: Joey DeLoach and Ryan Dawson
J:""Ryan and I were both born adventurers. Neither of us are ever satisfied with our immediate environment, and finding the proper tools to keep up with such a lifestyle is very difficult. I bike everywhere I go, and subsequently need an awesome bag to keep with those demands as well.""

R:""The idea for The Pandora was born out of an almost annoyance. Joey and I were tired of buying things that were cool but not nearly as cool as they could be.  We're both from a paramedic background so we are big on multi-functional things - that is, if it doesn't have at least 2 uses it not worth carrying. Joey is a bike messenger now and I'm  a geek/yogi - all of which share common ground in the venn-diagram of needing a bag like The Pandora Carryall.""
 J:""When Ryan first brought up the topic, I was ecstatic. No bag has ever met the standards set by my lifestyle. Now was the chance to make that perfect bag to be my personal ""MacGuyver"". Really when I think of the potential of this bag, I think of Batman's utility belt. It has to function as a mobile home base. When you're constantly moving and don't have time to return home for the essentials, is your bag going to be there for you?""
J:""All of the options in this bag are for surviving in our modern world. Whether it be hiking, climbing, biking, or even something as simple carrying what is required of you at your job. This bag is born of necessity, and I hope it fills all the needs of people who need such a thing in their lives.""
Where We're At...

We have compelted the intial design phases with our engineer Rob Irwin. We are currently in the process of selecting a manufacturer for new prototypes.

How We Plan to Spend:

Your current backpack may make you smile when you find five dollars in that nearly function-less front pocket, but it’ll make you crazy when you realize your phone charger or flash drive is missing at a crucial moment. Find random cash AND never have a technological panic attack with The Pandora Carryall.
The Pandora Carryall comes standard with:

Built-in USB ports and USB drive so you’ll never have “where'd I put that thumb drive” panic again.

Update: Carryall Organization  


Let’s face it; succeeding in our fast‐paced environment requires hardware, software, and brain-ware. But you will get “no-ware” without organization. Never helplessly flail your hand around the bottom of a bag again. The Pandora Carryall has you covered:

Numerous, conveniently sized pockets that separate important documents, writing utensils, and technology. 
Double-sided Velcro phone compartment: Once you stick your phone in the bag, it stays there.

RFID blocking compartment 
Carryall retractable lock for securing contents. Update: Carryall Versatility


“But I've had this bag for like, EVER!” 
Yes, well, it’s also tie‐dye. And it’s not your friend. It’s a bag. So it won't be offended when you give it the boot for a carryall that better suits your needs. You have a smart-phone, a smart-car, a smart-computer, and a smart-self. It’s time for a carryall that’s equally as smart.

Risks and Challenges:

Bad Wolf Outfitters recognizes that when it comes to fulfillment, every project has potential obstacles; from production delays to permits to collaborator mishaps; and that's why we have taken it all into account:
Production: 
Our engineer has been great through this initial design phases. As with any great endeavor, we are still working out feasibility when it comes to features, final price, and warranty.
Manufacturing:
In our search for manufacturers, we are looking for optimal production and distribution times. This is something that we are still engaged in doing. We realize that manufacturing The Pandora Carryall in bulk would be most beneficial to our needs and the needs of our customers, That is why we are working to ensure we build a relationship with a manufacturer who can not only produce a quality product but who can deliver in a timely manner. 
Time and Deadlines:
We may find as we go into production of The Pandora Carryall, that certain aspects of the carryall's unique features may take more time to put together. We are working incredibly hard to ensure that this product is available for our backers by November/December 2013 and full market distribution by January 2014. Hopefully by prototyping our first round we will be able to iron out any production issues from the get-go. 
The Reality:
We are here asking for your help to take this project closer to reality, and more than that, we are here looking for your input! The Pandora Carryall isn't about just being a great bag for you, it's about being the best bag built for you and by you. We also make you a pledge to keep you in the know with the latest news about our carryall. We will post a project update (which is emailed to all backers) detailing the steps of the project as we move to completion.You are more than a dollar amount, you are a part of a revolutionary jump forward in how we handle our ""smart"" gear!

FAQ's:
What stage of production are we at? 
We have completed the initial design phase with our engineer and are in the process of selecting a manufacturer for new prototypes.
Is the design final? 
No way! One of the best aspects of being at the fundraising/pre-production phase is that we can tweak the design according to feedback from backers. If you have any suggestions for new features or a change in design, please contact us or take our survey to offer your feedback! 
What sets The Pandora apart from other “smart” carryall products? 


The strongest feature we’re offering with The Pandora isn't any specific technical aspect--it’s that The Pandora is the only product both on the market and in the crowdfunding sphere that offers this combination of technology, design and functionality. Other carryalls have solar panels, speakers, sleek design and locator apps--but none of them have it all. Pair that with the customizable nature of being in pre-production and backers essentially have the option of building their product. 
When will it be available for public consumption? 
For backers... estimated December
For consumers 2014 
What if I can't donate money but want to help in other ways? 
Exposure is just as important when it comes to crowdfunding so you can help by featuring us and our campaign on your website, blog, or even on Facebook or Twitter. 
What technology is it compatible with (Apple, Windows, Ubuntu, etc)? 
Short answer - yes. 
What’s the battery life like? 
Back up battery will be around 13,000+ mAH which will give up to an extra 3 1/2 hours  extra time and double the battery life of smaller electronics The solar panel feature will allow continuous powering... so if it’s sunny then the battery life is theoretically whatever the half life of the lithium core is... so like a really long time 
What’s the coolest thing about The Pandora? 
The coolest thing about the Pandora is it has everything you could possibly need and if it doesn’t have it just tell us...
However our favorite feature ...
There are a lot of awesome aspects to the carryall, but probably the coolest part is that it has a SECRET COMPARTMENT that is x-ray resistant... you know to “protect” things like, um, undeveloped film...!",15.0,1,"1 Campaign

Alle Symbole, alle Darstellungen werden einfach gehalten und auf minimalistische Designdarstellung gesetzt und die Welt liebt es.Jo'n'Em sieht diesen Trend und setzt diese nun auch in der Modebranche um.Wir sind nicht die, die der Mode hinterher laufen, nein, wir sind diejenigen die, die Mode der Zukunft (mit-)beeinflussen werden.Hintergrund InformationenJo'n'Em Fashion ist eine Marke mit qualitativ hochwertigen Produkte. Nicht nur die Firma wurde in der Schweiz gegründet. Auch alle Produkte werde in der Schweiz Designet, eingekauft und hergestellt.

Der Name Jo'n'Em leitet sich ab von den Gründern ""Joel and Emmanuel,""Das Rad kann niemand neu Erfinder, aber man kann das bestehende weiter verwenden und verbessern, so auch Jo'n'Em.Alle Motive werde selbst von Hand skizziert und gemalt, dies verleiht ihnen eine Einmaligkeit die sonst nirgendswo auf der Welt vorhanden ist.Die Marke Jo'n'Em versucht nicht der Mode hinterher zu rennen, nein, sondern geht ihren eigene Weg und gibt vor was Mode ist.Wer mit Jo'n'Em Fashion durch die Gegend läuft, wird schnell den unterschied merken und diese Einmaligkeit genießen.Die Zukunft von Jo'n'EmZurzeit bietet Jo'n'Em ein Hand voll Kleider an, dies wird sich im laufe der Zukunft ändern.

Sie ist bereits jetzt schon einmalig und unverwechselbar, jede Person wird etwas finden, mit dem sie oder er sich identifizieren kann und dies ist erst der Anfang. Bereits werden im Hintergrund Pläne geschmiedet für die Nächsten Kollektionen, bei der wir eine noch grösseren und einmaligeren Wiedererkennungswert aufbauen werden.
Wir Zählen auf euch :)Um all diese großen und weiten Ziele zu erreichen Braucht mann natürlich ein gewisses Start Kapital. Dies ist auch der Grund warum wir hier sind. Wir sind in gewissen Massen auf eure Unterstützung und Mitwirkung angewiesen, wenn wir mehr erreichen wollen. Dazu kommt, dass unser Genialer Designer nicht mehr bei uns ist und einen neuen Freiarbeiter zu finden ist nicht leicht, weshalb wir uns nun entschieden haben einen Designer Fest ein zu stellen. Mit diesem Startkapital möchten wir nicht nur den Lohn bezahlen, sondern auch unsere Einkäufe tätigen. Auch müssen damit diverse Prototypen bezahlen, bevor wir eine neue Kollektion in Serie Produzieren.Desweiteren ist es auch ein Ziel den ersten Jo'n'Em Fashiondesign Laden zu eröffnen, da wir uns nicht nur auf den Onlinestore konzentrieren möchten.DiversesWen Sie mehr sehen Wollen, besuchen Sie doch unsere Hompage: www.jonem.chFür weitere Fragen können Sie und eine nachricht Hinterrlassen an die E-Mail Adresse: info@jonem.chAusserdem finden Sie uns auf Folgenden Sozialen Medien:Facebook Fanpage: https://www.facebook.com/pages/JonEm-Fashiondesign/413586522074793?ref_type=bookmarkTwitter: https://twitter.com/Jonem_FashionEin Dankeschön aus tiefstem Herzen <3Wir Danken allen aus Tiefstem herzen für Eure tatkräftige Unterstützung.

are so convinced of the quality of our products that we decided to
give you a 3-year limited international warranty on all 1st Edition
watches that can be purchased through this crowdfunding campaign.</span><br/></p>
<p>It is important to stress that we, at Lionstone Watches, are sworn enemies of
planned obsolescence.

<p>We
would rather receive a mail from you in 10 years from now, thanking

Watches is here to stay. </p>
<p>After a successful campaign we will

feel that only the highest quality is good enough for our customers

<p>We will leverage increasing sales numbers only to invest back in our

<h3><b>The Warranty</b></h3>

The hands, dial, and watch movement are the only components

<li>Damage resulting from improper handling, lack of care, accidents, or normal wear and tear.</li>

<p>Lionstone Watches is a startup watch brand based in Ingolstadt, Germany. 
It was founded in 2014 by Daniel Kampf and Fabian Hofmann, who always had a passion for watches and horology. This passion results in a constant 
desire to improve the current luxury watch market by making quality and 
elegant timepieces more affordable. The team has spent months 
experimenting with various designs and working with leading 
manufacturers in order to offer a modern, quality ceramic watch at a low
 price.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>The challenges lie in the gathering of a critical mass that helps to 
kickstart our project. We believe that our concept and our products can 
change the luxury watch market for the better. All we need now is to 
reach as many people as possible in order to inform them about us.</p>
<p>We researched and experimented a lot and we finally found a 
manufacturer that is reliable, professional and has a very good 
reputation in the watch industry.</p>
<p>We will do our utmost possible to keep our schedule and deliver the 
watches on time, but there can of course be unforeseen circumstances 
which could extend this period. This is the case with every crowdfunding
 project but we are confident in the partners that we chose and their 
ability to keep their schedule.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help
</h3>
<p>Select the amount you would like to contribute using the boxes on the
 right, and choose the quality watch that you want to make your 
statement. We also completely understand if you cannot help us 
financially right now, but you can still help to spread the word! Here 
are a few other ways you can help:</p>

The SUPERSLIM CERAMIC





Our
SUPERSLIM CERAMIC is truly the pinnacle of the Lionstone Superslim
Collection. Made from a High-Tech Ceramic it is as durable as it is
magnificent to behold. This watch makes a majestic impression regardless of the setting.

And
the restraint of its design is the very key to its beauty.




The
Superslim Ceramic is available in Jet Black in both, men and women's
sizes.


And
for women exclusively, we additionally offer it in Alpine White with
rosé coloured details.








The SUPERSLIM

The Lionstone Superslim is everything that you want in a watch and 
will make it hard if not impossible, to wear any other watch from the 
moment you first put it on your wrist.

It is the delicately grooved case, the antique-inspired curved lugs, 
the sword blade shaped hands and the subtle reflecting sunray dial, that
 make the Lionstone Superslim such an alluring and desirable timepiece.

All of our watches are made from the best materials.
The Superslim is made from 316L surgical grade stainless steel and 
features a premium, 20mm wide, hand made, genuine leather strap with 
accentuated white stitching. This kind of strap is commonly found on 
watches in the 1000€+ price range.

The Superslim is available in Classic Silver and Midnight Black /
 and it will be, for whatever outfit you choose, absolutely perfect.







Our Core Principles 

We
are so convinced of the quality of our products that we decided to
give you a 3-year limited international warranty on all 1st Edition
watches that can be purchased through this crowdfunding campaign.
It is important to stress that we, at Lionstone Watches, are sworn enemies of
planned obsolescence. 

We
would rather receive a mail from you in 10 years from now, thanking
us for our still fully functioning watch, then have you return in 2
years to buy a new one.
Lionstone
Watches is here to stay. 
After a successful campaign we will
continue to develop and produce beautiful and durable watches. 

We
feel that only the highest quality is good enough for our customers
and we did not compromise any of it when choosing the materials and
components.
We will leverage increasing sales numbers only to invest back in our 
watches for your benefit. What we mean by that is explained in our 
stretch goals.

The Warranty

The hands, dial, and watch movement are the only components 
covered under the warranty. If the watch proves to be defective in 
material or workmanship under normal use, it will be repaired or 
replaced free of charge. A return shipping and handling fee will apply 
to all warranty service.The warranty does not cover:

Battery, case, crystal, strap, or bracelet.
Damage resulting from improper handling, lack of care, accidents, or normal wear and tear.
Water damage unless marked water-resistant.

THIS WARRANTY IS VOID IF THE WATCH HAS BEEN DAMAGED BY ACCIDENT, 
NEGLIGENCE, UNAUTHORIZED SERVICE, OR OTHER FACTORS NOT DUE TO DEFECTS IN
 MATERIAL OR WORKMANSHIP.
The Schedule
The timeline below illustrates our approximate schedule.
We planned everything as accurately as possible but unforeseen 
circumstances can always occur and we hope for your understanding in 
case of delays.

The Team


Lionstone Watches is a startup watch brand based in Ingolstadt, Germany. 
It was founded in 2014 by Daniel Kampf and Fabian Hofmann, who always had a passion for watches and horology. This passion results in a constant 
desire to improve the current luxury watch market by making quality and 
elegant timepieces more affordable. The team has spent months 
experimenting with various designs and working with leading 
manufacturers in order to offer a modern, quality ceramic watch at a low
 price.
Risks & Challenges



The challenges lie in the gathering of a critical mass that helps to 
kickstart our project. We believe that our concept and our products can 
change the luxury watch market for the better. All we need now is to 
reach as many people as possible in order to inform them about us.
We researched and experimented a lot and we finally found a 
manufacturer that is reliable, professional and has a very good 
reputation in the watch industry.
We will do our utmost possible to keep our schedule and deliver the 
watches on time, but there can of course be unforeseen circumstances 
which could extend this period. This is the case with every crowdfunding
 project but we are confident in the partners that we chose and their 
ability to keep their schedule.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We have designed <b>AkuaHelp</b> with the purpose of
improving  the needs and solving problems for people practicing aquatic
sports. We have been working on this project for a year focusing specially on children’s
safety so they  can enjoy aquatic sports.
Statistics presented by the World Health Organization explain that  every hour 42 people die in situations

children are practicing aquatic sports.<br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446688620/pukteqzgb4euvrqiwgxr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><b>AKUAHELP</b> is a neoprene suit of 3 and 1 mm that posses four inflatable chambers. This division is aimed to prevent malfunctions of the chambers in case one of them is broken, in order to offer more security. The system of activation of these chambers can be automatic or manual.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The automatic system was designed for children under 7, for people with disabilities or elderly people. When the suit gets in contact with water, the inflatable system activates the CO2 cartridge. Moreover, the automatic system emits a signal that can be received in smartphones, communicating that the person using the suit is in contact with water. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447133443/iqakhhar5m4dcmyl9wbg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>On the other hand, the manual system was designed for teenagers or people dexterous in water.   This systems creates support in situations of emergency such as, an athlete suffering  a heart attack or a strong concussion  due to the nature of the sport practiced. The activation of the inflatable chambers eases the rescuing process since the buoyancy of the person using the suit would increase.</p><p>The manual system has to be activated by the person using <b>AkuaHelp</b> through a valve, located on the bottom right part of the suit. (This system could be relocated on the bottom left side if requested by the customer, since we acknowledge that there is 10% of left handed people in the world, who would feel more comfortable if the valve was on the opposite side.)</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446619229/xz0bqhic0zwqlhbgltmq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p></p><p><b>AKUAHELP</b> has a little ring located on one shoulder. This has a keyring-whistle-compass aimed to help the user in distress. The whistle can be used when searching for help in case of emergency and the compass provides orientation.</p><p>Moreover, <b>AkuaHelp</b> will have and additional device on both shoulders that will allow the adjustment of a GoPro, HERO4 Session or Polaroid CUBE camera. This will allow athletes to record their movements while practicing their favorite sports.</p><p>Because of hight risk of shark attacks for people who practice aquatic sports around the globe, we have equipped <b>AkuaHelp</b> with a magnetic system of four components. These are located around the torso of the suit in order to offer more security to our clients. Sharks have electric receptors called ampullae of Lorenzini; when a magnet of specific characteristics is near the electro receptors, it bothers the sharks, keeping them away from the person using <b>AkuaHelp</b>. This system of protection is more efficient when there is a group of people using <b>AkuaHelp</b> on the same zone. </p><br/>

<p><b>Noviembre 2014</b>.- después de unas vacaciones en la playa, y frente a las preocupaciones de tener niños pequeños en entornos de mar y piscinas. Nace la idea de crear un sistema de protección que nos ofrezca seguridad y comodidad, todos los productos que ofrece el mercado brindan una escasa movilidad, dificultando el disfrute y aprendizaje de la natación o los deportes en el agua.</p>
<p><b>Enero – Octubre 2015</b>.- durante este periodo de tiempo, fuimos trabajando en varias ideas, algunas eran posibles y otras no. Después de varias dificultades encontradas y frente a las ocupaciones de cada uno de nosotros, incluso pensamos en abandonar la idea. Tomando en cuenta no solo los problemas de diseño, sino principalmente los financieros que se debe enfrentar para colocar nuevos productos en el mercado. Fue en este contexto que descubrimos la existencia de los sistemas de crowdfunding, los cuales hacen más fácil el desarrollo de nuevas ideas y productos.</p>
<p>Con el apoyo de familiares y amigos que siempre creyeron en nuestro proyecto, fuimos mejorando y superando las dificultades, sobre todo acogiendo sus acotaciones y sugerencias, las cuales fueron un gran aporte para que <b>AkuaHelp</b> sea una realidad.</p>
<p><b>Octubre – Noviembre 2015</b>.- empezamos la difusión de <b>AkuaHelp</b>, con la esperanza y la convicción de lo importante que es la seguridad de nuestros seres queridos y de nosotros mismo. Y con el firme propósito de poder transmitir la idea a muchas personas para convertir este proyecto en una realidad.</p>
<p><b>Noviembre – Febrero 2016</b>.- una vez alcanzada la meta, realizaremos todas las pruebas para asegurarnos de cumplir con altos estándares de calidad y cumplir con normativa internacional para satisfacer a todos nuestros patrocinadores, cuando <b>AkuaHelp</b> llegue a sus manos. Hemos conversado con algunas empresas fabricantes, de algunos de los componentes que serán utilizados en el <b>AkuaHelp</b>, ya que cuentan con una vasta experiencia y cumplen con normas internacionales y altos estándares de calidad.</p>
<p><b>Febrero – Octubre 2016</b>.- este es el tiempo en que las empresas con las que hemos tomado contacto y serán las proveedoras de algunos de los componentes del <b>AkuaHelp</b>, nos han ofrecido entregar dichos implementos.

</div></div>","You can also get information on our websiteVersión en: ESPAÑOLAkuaHelp provides the safest and most comfortable aquatic sports
experience. It was designed for beginners and experts who are passionate about
 aquatic activities!
What is AkuaHelp?
We have designed AkuaHelp with the purpose of
improving  the needs and solving problems for people practicing aquatic
sports. We have been working on this project for a year focusing specially on children’s
safety so they  can enjoy aquatic sports.
Statistics presented by the World Health Organization explain that  every hour 42 people die in situations
involving water This product aims to alleviateparent’sconcerns when their
children are practicing aquatic sports.AKUAHELP is a neoprene suit of 3 and 1 mm that posses four inflatable chambers. This division is aimed to prevent malfunctions of the chambers in case one of them is broken, in order to offer more security. The system of activation of these chambers can be automatic or manual.The automatic system was designed for children under 7, for people with disabilities or elderly people. When the suit gets in contact with water, the inflatable system activates the CO2 cartridge. Moreover, the automatic system emits a signal that can be received in smartphones, communicating that the person using the suit is in contact with water. On the other hand, the manual system was designed for teenagers or people dexterous in water.   This systems creates support in situations of emergency such as, an athlete suffering  a heart attack or a strong concussion  due to the nature of the sport practiced. The activation of the inflatable chambers eases the rescuing process since the buoyancy of the person using the suit would increase.The manual system has to be activated by the person using AkuaHelp through a valve, located on the bottom right part of the suit. (This system could be relocated on the bottom left side if requested by the customer, since we acknowledge that there is 10% of left handed people in the world, who would feel more comfortable if the valve was on the opposite side.)
IMPORTANT INFORMATION: THE 16GR.
CARTRIDGES OF CO2 USED BY THE SUIT CAN BE FOUND IN ANY SPORTS SHOP, WEAPON SHOP
OR BREWERS ACCESSORIES SHOP. WHICH FACILITATES THE PROCESS OF RECHARGING THE
SUIT. 


AKUAHELP has a little ring located on one shoulder. This has a keyring-whistle-compass aimed to help the user in distress. The whistle can be used when searching for help in case of emergency and the compass provides orientation.Moreover, AkuaHelp will have and additional device on both shoulders that will allow the adjustment of a GoPro, HERO4 Session or Polaroid CUBE camera. This will allow athletes to record their movements while practicing their favorite sports.Because of hight risk of shark attacks for people who practice aquatic sports around the globe, we have equipped AkuaHelp with a magnetic system of four components. These are located around the torso of the suit in order to offer more security to our clients. Sharks have electric receptors called ampullae of Lorenzini; when a magnet of specific characteristics is near the electro receptors, it bothers the sharks, keeping them away from the person using AkuaHelp. This system of protection is more efficient when there is a group of people using AkuaHelp on the same zone. 

Places around the world where shark attacks are common


In addition to all the features presented above, AkuaHelp also has a neon filament, The same that can be turned on manually by the user, this allows the person to be more visible in situations of darkness or fogginess. There are two types of lighting that the filament offers, one permanent and oneintermittent. Besides being an excellent system for locating users in emergency situations, it can also work as an original accessory for beach parties and raves.It can be chosen in a variety of colors.AKUAHELP IN DE MEDIA


AKUAHELP suits will have eight different presentations. There will be four different models, which subdivide in either manual (M) or automatic (A) systems. This offers a variety of options to our sponsors and their needs.AKUAHELP Standard M.- This suit includes just the four inflatable chambers operated by the manual system. This is ideal for people who seek support in water when learning how to swim.

Who are we?



After our campaign.
November 2014.- Many  scenarios can be  encountered during a family vacation on the
beach.  Kids are running around near
pools or the sea unprotected.  This
product offers securty and confort for parents and children  in this type of environment.   January- October 2015.- We worked on our product prototype.  . We analyzed different ideas and evaluated
the challenges of creating such product. We encountered problems when creating
the design of our suit and also financial difficulties to manufacture it. This
is when we found out about the crowdfunding campaigns, which reopened the door
to our idea. 
With the help of family and friends we improved our design, listening to all
the suggestions they made and the key benefits  when looking for a product like AkuaHelp.
October- November 2015.- we started to advertise our product
through social media. The message that we sent across was the importance of
having a product that offers security for our family and ourselves when we want
to enjoy aquatic environments.
November- February 2016.- once we have reached our crowdfunding
goal, we will test our design in order to satisfy the high standards of quality
that we aim to reach at an international level. We hope to be in touch with
enterprises that manufacture  some of the
pieces we need in order to make AkuaHelp. 
February- October 2016.- during this time we will be
manufacturing AkuaHelp with the help of our sponsors who are willing to negotiate with us,
offering their products. For reasons out of our control,  the time to fabricate our product could be one
or two months later than expected.
November 2016.- Eureka! AkuaHelp will be distributed
worldwide so you can enjoy with your family the advantages that our product
offers.  ESPAÑOL
 
AKUAHELP es la
forma más segura y cómoda de disfrutar en el agua. ¡Diseñado para acoplarse
tanto a principiantes como a expertos que les apasiona los
distintos deportes acuáticos!

¿Qué es AkuaHelp?

Hemos diseñado AkuaHelp, para
solventar todas las necesidades y dificultades a las que están expuestas todas
las personas que realizan deportes acuáticos.
Venimos trabajando desde hace
casi un año, pensando en todas las preocupaciones que los padres enfrentamos
cuando tenemos niños pequeños, por lo que nos hemos planteado brindar seguridad
de manera especial a los niños y tranquilidad a sus padres, tomando en cuenta
las alarmantes cifras mundiales de personas que mueren (42 personas por hora,
según datos de la OMS) y otras tantas sufren lesiones por ahogamiento. Dichas
cifras cada vez van en aumento. 

AKUAHELP, en un buzo de
neopreno de 3 y 1 mm. combinado con un sistema de cuatro cámaras inflables,
para ofrecer mayor seguridad en caso de que alguna de ellas sufriera daño; el
sistema de inflado puede ser automático o manual.

El sistema automático
está diseñado para niños menores de 7 años, personas con capacidades especiales
o adultos mayores, el cual hace que al contacto con el agua se dispare el
sistema del cartucho de CO2, inflando
las cuatro cámarasy emitiendo una señal
hacia su Smartphone, para comunicarnos que esa persona se encuentra en el agua.




Por otra parte, el sistema
manual está diseñado para ser usado por adolescentes o personas diestras en el
agua, solventando un apoyo en situaciones emergentes, como por ejemplo
calambres, infartos o impactos producto de los deportes que realizan, lo cual
facilitara la espera y las labores de rescate al aumentar la flotabilidad de
quien lo usa. 

El sistema manual es
accionado por el portador del AkuaHelp, a través de una válvula, ubicada en la
parte inferior derecha. (Este sistema podría ser colocado en el costado
izquierdo, bajo pedido, en vista de que existe un 10% de personas zurdas en el
mundo, a quienes también hemos tomado en cuenta) 



NOTA
IMPORTANTE: LOS
CARTUCHOS DE 16 gr. DE CO2 QUE UTILIZA EL AKUAHELP, SE ENCUENTRAN A DISPOSICIÓN
EN CUALQUIER TIENDA DE ARTICULOS DEPORTIVOS, ACCESORIOS PARA BICICLETAS,
TIENDAS DE ARMAMENTO O TIENDAS DE ACCESORIOS CERVECEROS. LO CUAL OFRECE A
NUESTROS CLIENTES FACILIDAD PARA RECARGAR SU AKUAHELP.

El AKUAHELP, posee una pequeña argolla colocada en el hombro. En esta se
acopla un llavero-silbato-brújula, el silbato brinda soporte al buscar ayuda en
caso de emergencia y la brújula proporciona orientación.
Adicional el AkuaHelp tendrá
en ambos hombros unas pequeñas bases que permiten el acople de cámaras GoPro
HERO4 Session o Polaroid CUBE, para que tanto deportistas extremos como
aficionados puedan realizar los videos de sus hazañas.
Frente a los crecientes
ataques de tiburones a las personas que realizan distintos deportes acuáticos
alrededor del mundo, el AkuaHelp, está equipado con un  sistema magnético de cuatro componentes,
distribuidos en el entorno del torso de la persona para brindar mayor
seguridad. Los tiburones tienen sensores
eléctricos llamados ampollas de Lorenzini; cuando
un imán de ciertas características está cercano a estos electro-receptores,
este produce malestar en los escualos, manteniéndolos alejados y brindando
seguridad a quienes portan el AkuaHelp, mientras mayor sea el número de
personas que utilicen este sistema de protección, el campo de acción se vuelve
más seguro. 



Además el AkuaHelp posee un
filamento de neón, que es encendido de forma manual por el usuario,
permitiéndole ser más visible en caso de oscuridad o nubosidad, dicho sistema
dispone de dos tipos de encendido, permanente o intermitente. 
Este además de ser un sistema

¿Quienes somos?



Después de nuestra campaña.



Noviembre 2014.- después de unas vacaciones en la playa, y frente a las preocupaciones de tener niños pequeños en entornos de mar y piscinas. Nace la idea de crear un sistema de protección que nos ofrezca seguridad y comodidad, todos los productos que ofrece el mercado brindan una escasa movilidad, dificultando el disfrute y aprendizaje de la natación o los deportes en el agua.
Enero – Octubre 2015.- durante este periodo de tiempo, fuimos trabajando en varias ideas, algunas eran posibles y otras no. Después de varias dificultades encontradas y frente a las ocupaciones de cada uno de nosotros, incluso pensamos en abandonar la idea. Tomando en cuenta no solo los problemas de diseño, sino principalmente los financieros que se debe enfrentar para colocar nuevos productos en el mercado. Fue en este contexto que descubrimos la existencia de los sistemas de crowdfunding, los cuales hacen más fácil el desarrollo de nuevas ideas y productos.
Con el apoyo de familiares y amigos que siempre creyeron en nuestro proyecto, fuimos mejorando y superando las dificultades, sobre todo acogiendo sus acotaciones y sugerencias, las cuales fueron un gran aporte para que AkuaHelp sea una realidad.
Octubre – Noviembre 2015.- empezamos la difusión de AkuaHelp, con la esperanza y la convicción de lo importante que es la seguridad de nuestros seres queridos y de nosotros mismo. Y con el firme propósito de poder transmitir la idea a muchas personas para convertir este proyecto en una realidad.
Noviembre – Febrero 2016.- una vez alcanzada la meta, realizaremos todas las pruebas para asegurarnos de cumplir con altos estándares de calidad y cumplir con normativa internacional para satisfacer a todos nuestros patrocinadores, cuando AkuaHelp llegue a sus manos. Hemos conversado con algunas empresas fabricantes, de algunos de los componentes que serán utilizados en el AkuaHelp, ya que cuentan con una vasta experiencia y cumplen con normas internacionales y altos estándares de calidad.
Febrero – Octubre 2016.- este es el tiempo en que las empresas con las que hemos tomado contacto y serán las proveedoras de algunos de los componentes del AkuaHelp, nos han ofrecido entregar dichos implementos. Por motivos o dificultades ajenas a nuestra voluntad este periodo podría alargarse uno o dos meses.
Noviembre 2016.- ¡Eureka!, usted tendrá el AkuaHelp en sus manos y podrá disfrutar con toda su familia de la seguridad y las bondades de nuestro producto.",44.0,3,"1 Campaign

These are my specialty!   Risks and ChallengesWe believe that there exist set of rules for manufacturing. Should have “Technologies, Facilities, Experts, Trusted partners, Patience along with Passion”. I am confident that we have abundant experience that can combine these criteria  to work properly in unity. There were also many challenges establishing these systems. However, one thing has never changed. It’s the credibility to our customers and we can call it dignity at our side.

Certification & TestingEfforts and passion can prove nothing. All the related parts and the products must undergo considerable number of  tests and pass the standards and regulations by the ‘ Officially authorized organizations ’ that grants the legitimacy of the product. Some are finished and some are proceeding now. It shows where we are and when we can ship! 3. ManufacturingManufacturing can always face unexpected circumstances.10 years of manufacturing experience in the optical industry give us great confidence and guidelines. 4. Supply Chain RiskWe were active in the sports sunglasses industry in Korea til now. And we feel really assured with the quality of product when it comes to domestic production . Sometimes it’s inefficient and unmanageable when producing aboard. Most of the new parts for this project is also controlled by domestic companies and already finished assessment. 5. Wraparound ergonomic design We constantly made revisions on way to approach ""Wrap-around Ergonomic Design"" which is the subject in its own right. Wearable device should be comfortable just like your ordinary sunglasses. It was also the great challenge for us to make wearable by keeping its essential properties.

We love our plastic watch, especially pebble watch, and want to add some incredible value on it and don't want to affect the original design.

We focus on NFC technology, as we believe it is an amazing technology. And, we also are exciting for the iphone 6 with NFC function. We are pleased to develop more and more NFC products for improving our life. Wearable device also is our target, we are looking forward that you will use our product every days and share with others.

When we develop SUNZs, we encountered three main challenges. One is nfc chip ,two is manufacturing and final one is apps designing. 

We found so many factories, as we need a nfc chip whose size can install in SUNZs, fortunately we found it although it is more expensive but we want to provide good quality product to our customers so we chose it. As we know that your satisfactory is our motivation.

Another challenges is how to control the quality of manufacturing,
We have a meeting with many factories, they suggested many ways to assembly this product. finally we chose the most expensive way because product quality is our most concern.

The final challenge is apps. We want to provide attractive and convenient user experience to our customers so we made this wonderful lock screen and we also know privacy is the most concern of our customers, so we provide gallery lock and file lock.

Nowadays people like to use smart phone with large screen, so we want to make something which can let our customer use their phone more easily and efficiency. The QUICK UI aim for it, when you use SUNZs tap behind your smart phone ,the QUICK UI will pop up immediately, you can default eight apps into two pages as your favourite.

 Jaka started his education in early age and he earned his first snowboard and motocross bike when he was only seven years old in a home workshop, where he energetically drew knowledge. 
They are very well educated textile designers, lovers of extreme sports, nature and animals. In free time they also love to paint and create music.

Idea about Easy Life Belt was born when Jaka had enough feeling that classic belt limited him in his work and sport activities. Than they found out that people sit more and more each day - some of them even 14 hours a day. Based on this finding they immediately started to work. After a number of trials they created unique Gipsy and Clown belt – Easy Life Belt. 


This belt is the only belt in the world, which has inserted the elastic part. The elastic part is located at the front of the belt, because in that part of the body the physical workload is the biggest.
Jaka found manufacturer of high quality military cotton webbing and experts who helped him to develop unique durable elastic part of the belt (which was developed for this belt only). He and his friends tested this belt for more than one year. They were impressed about it and they would not replace it any more for the ordinary belt. When the belt received first positive feedback and fans, it was time for a design. The belt is designed with a lot of sense and love for street wear.
EASY LIFE BELT breathes with the user. The belt has positive effect on a daily life, user´s feelings and emotions. You can use it during work, sport or any other free activity you like! SUPPORT us and become a part of our circus!  You will get the first belt that breathes with you! Try Easy Life Belt and you'll see. You'll never replace it anymore.

<h3>Background</h3>

<div><p>I have many things to carry, so I always bring a backpack. I have four more at home. I asked myself. <strong>Why do I have five backpacks? </strong>Because I have the various ""me"" like a bag designer at the workplace and a fashionable man out of office. Backpacks are my identity and taste, so I want to wear different designs as I change my clothes.  <strong>Changing backpack was not a big deal before I realize some problems.</strong> The worst thing is every single time I change it, I repeat the same actions. Take out all the stuff and repack. Again and again. Through my life, I spent too much time and energy on changing them. Moreover, USB, documents, keys, a wallet or pens should be in the backpack, yet they were at home. That wouldn’t happen if I didn’t do it. So I began to draw a design of backpack that can solve the problems. VS is the result of the concept, and I put all of my experiences into VS as a bag designer.</p></div>

<p><span>We are a team of designers with a fresh take on industrial waste. We give the leftover materials from industrial production a new lease of life by designing products from what would normally be thrown away. Interested in ecology and the stories behind products, we think it’s essential to be part of the solution to a growing problem. So we do what we believe in: we save materials, produce beauty and deliver happiness. That’s Contiqua. </span></p>

<p>Contiqua’s Classic Wallet is a timeless piece with a modern twist. Our designer set out on an unique mission: create a wallet from a small bit of leftover leather. She pushed her creative limits and came up with something unexpected.</p>
<p>It’s a gem, an example of state-of-the-art craftsmanship designed to hold cards and bank notes. The classical lines of the wallet are enhanced by details such as beveled corners and contrasting inner colours.</p>

About







We are a team of designers with a fresh take on industrial waste. We give the leftover materials from industrial production a new lease of life by designing products from what would normally be thrown away. Interested in ecology and the stories behind products, we think it’s essential to be part of the solution to a growing problem. So we do what we believe in: we save materials, produce beauty and deliver happiness. That’s Contiqua. 






Perks







Card Sleeve





A great companion designed to fit in the inner pocket of your jacket or the back pocket of your jeans. Easily swallows six credit cards and a pack of business cards. It’s so minimalist that many gents replace their wallets with it. If you tend to carry a gazillion cards that don’t fit in your wallet, this is a perfect solution.


Made of organic premium quality leather

Six separate card slots

One compartment for business cards or extra notes
Size: 95 x 76 mm










iCover




Give your phone a bit of style and some extra protection. This cover is specifically designed for the smaller of the two phones, the iPhone 6. And if you’re used to hitting the streets with nothing more than your phone, the small pocket for a few banknotes comes in handy.


Fits iPhone 6

Made of organic premium quality leather
One compartment for notes or anything foldable

Size: 85 x 115 mm












Classic Wallet






Contiqua’s Classic Wallet is a timeless piece with a modern twist. Our designer set out on an unique mission: create a wallet from a small bit of leftover leather. She pushed her creative limits and came up with something unexpected.
It’s a gem, an example of state-of-the-art craftsmanship designed to hold cards and bank notes. The classical lines of the wallet are enhanced by details such as beveled corners and contrasting inner colours.




Made of organic premium quality leather


Compartment for notes (fits all currencies, no divider)


Ten separate card slots


Two handy compartments hidden behind the card slots (for extra cards or anything you want to keep private)


Size: 97 x 208 mm









Coin Wallet





Contiqua’s coin wallet is another timeless piece that complements the Classic Wallet. If you’re tired of coins rattling in your pocket, here’s the solution: dump your change in the coin tray, slide the credit cards in the slots and you’re still left with plenty of room for bank notes and things you want to keep private. And enjoy the enhancing details like beveled corners and contrasting inner colours.


Made of organic premium quality leather
Compartment for notes (fits all currencies, no divider)
Five separate card slots
Neat coin pocket

Size: 97 x 208 mm









Leather Waste

These are bits of leather left over from manufacturing state-of-the-art furniture. It’s perfect, top-quality material that’s just too small to be used.
We had a choice - trash it or save it. We choose the latter. By turning it into new leather products like wallets, card sleeves or phone covers. Are you with us?

Coffee anytime, anywhere for Early Birds





Being one of the Early Birds means more than a good feeling and a unique thing in the hand. Whenever you bump into someone of our team -- and show them something with our ‘No 1’ sign, a wallet, for example -- they’re obliged to have a coffee with you.

It all started when Hilla, a fashion journalist stood in front of her closet one day

As one who loves playing mix and

Hilla has started to develop this unique product, grabbing her husband Ido to walk with her in this new entrepreneurs path and be a part of the journey. As most men, he didn't quite understand what is this weird shirt that his wife insist to call ""the next best thing' , but quickly he got the hang of it and became in charge of the logistics and financial departments in the venture. 





So basically, we're reinventing the Dickey. Collar bibs have been around for over 120 years, and were very popular in Europe and the US – known as detachable collar, Chemisette, and of course a Dickey.
What makes NEAT unique is the design: In the past a collar was worn like an apron, but each Neat Collar is dressed as a vest – making it the perfect fashion accessory to wear under a shirt, to combine high fashion and maximum comfort.



Delivered worldwide, you can find these collars on business women, lawyers, religious women and fashionistas – the one product offers different solutions to customers all around the globe.

NEW COLLECTION >>
A fresh new line of collars, to be worn like a sport bra – has three different looks that you can play with. You can wear it with or without a bra, closed, semi open or even backwards. 


Neat is also planning to expand - designing a men collection and a teen collection.

   Perks We are proud to offer our loyal backers wholesale pricing on our collar vests.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Community Shields/SHLD is a collaborative effort to support our community through innovation and design. Our team is comprised of highly skilled fabricators and machine shop operators with over 50 years of combined experience in crafting technical solutions to complex problems. We've also had 2 successful Kickstarter campaigns. The Air Lever and the Stompump.</p>
<p>We first started making plastic face shields over 3 months ago to address the nation wide PPE shortage. Since then we have fabricated and shipped over 15,000 face shields nationwide free of charge to essential medical workers. We launched this Indiegogo campaign to obtain funding to create designs and die-cut units to quickly and easily produce more needed PPE.  As we transition to the next phase of re-opening, we are committed to ensuring that essential workers, schools, businesses, and communities have the protections they need to reopen. </p>

<h2>Risks and challenges</h2>

With each product, there are always unforeseen challenges. We have tried to mitigate as many challenges as we could predict. SHLD has spent the last 6 months getting our line of face shields ready for production. This includes engineering, designing, prototyping, testing, and tooling for the product. The Face Shields we've come up with have been universally praised by our testers, early reviewers, and doctors &amp; medical professionals. We have sourced only the best materials for our Shields. We have engaged contract manufacturers with a strong history of hitting timelines and exceptional quality control. Most importantly, We have existing relationships and proven track records with these suppliers. While we are thoroughly confident in our process, each product carries unique risks and challenges. For SHLD, this includes: - Potential for packaging and or tooling modifications - Packaging or shipping delays SHLD Inc. has a sum of 35 years of delivering exceptional products to end-users and clients. We will not sacrifice quality. If we encounter any issues with our product, we will immediately communicate with our backers, providing them all information about the delay and options available. Our experience and history of delivering successful products to market illustrates our ability to deliver to all our backers within the defined timeline while maintaining exceptional service, quality, and support. Our commitment to you, as our backers, is frequent and transparent communication throughout this process, and the assurance you are completely thrilled with the product.</p>
<h3>Reusability and recyclability</h3>
<p>Our Face Shields easy to clean and maintain. Furthermore, they are made with PET plastic that is highly recyclable and used in many post-consumer products. Check with your local refuse service to understand how best to recycle PET Plastics.</p>

<p>Nowaday, the world is flooded with fake, and clone products everywhere. Repetitive boring industrial products seem outgun and outnumber true art. So I decided to make an exclusive designed accessory that represents your unique personality.</p>
<p>I’m bringing to Indiegogo not just 1 but 3 designs of the exclusive 100% pure red copper mask pendant with a genuine leather strap of your choice. The product has its own oxidized patina with the aesthetical appeal in dark brown. The patina can provide a protective covering to materials that would otherwise be damaged by corrosion or weathering. The oxidized patina of copper by nature brings a unique antique look with sheen under sun light.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/956176/files/20141024063818-copper.jpg?1414157898"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The nature of pure copper itself makes it standout between bronze and brass.  Copper offers a few key advantages over brass and bronze:</p>

<h1>#1 Indy</h1>
<p>The product was inspired by THE NORTHEN INDIAN MASK that associates spiritually to the wearer. For his protection, the wearer is required to follow certain sanctioned procedures in his use of the mask. He plays the role of an actor in cooperation or collaboration with the mask. Without his performing dance and posturing routines, which are often accompanied with music, the mask would remain a representation without a full life force. After putting on the mask, the wearer undergoes a psychic change and as in a trance assumes the spirit character depicted by the mask.</p>
<p>I found another way of wearing a mask without putting it on. Just like the real mask itself, the wearer of Indy shows a strong personality, courage and confidence of a warrior in modern age of course with the authentic aesthetical appeal.</p>

<h1><b>#2 EIH: (EASTER ISLAND HEAD)</b></h1>
<p>Many archaeologists suggest that ""the statues were thus symbols of AUTHORITY and POWER, both religious and political. But they were not only symbols. To the people who erected and used them, they were actual repositories of sacred spirit. Carved stone and wooden objects in ancient Polynesian religions, when properly fashioned and ritually prepared, were believed to be charged by a magical spiritual essence called mana.""Archaeologists believe that the statues were a representation of the ancient Polynesians` ancestors. The statues face away from the ocean and towards the villages as if to watch over the people. The exception is the seven Ahu Akivi which face out to sea to help travelers find the island. There is a legend that says there were seven men who waited for their king to arrive.</p>
<p>Hence, the EIH itself represents POWER and AUTHORITY. The pendant supposes to carry thus same spirit to enrich the prosperity of its wearer.</p>

</div></div>","Nowaday, the world is flooded with fake, and clone products everywhere. Repetitive boring industrial products seem outgun and outnumber true art. So I decided to make an exclusive designed accessory that represents your unique personality.
I’m bringing to Indiegogo not just 1 but 3 designs of the exclusive 100% pure red copper mask pendant with a genuine leather strap of your choice. The product has its own oxidized patina with the aesthetical appeal in dark brown. The patina can provide a protective covering to materials that would otherwise be damaged by corrosion or weathering. The oxidized patina of copper by nature brings a unique antique look with sheen under sun light.

The nature of pure copper itself makes it standout between bronze and brass.  Copper offers a few key advantages over brass and bronze:
1st copper is one of the few materials that will truly stand the test of time. Copper and copper alloys provide strong resistance to atmospheric exposure, such as roofing and other architectural uses, hardware, building…
2nd The second advantage of copper over brass, bronze is the true sustainability of the material from an eco-friendly perspective. Copper is the more likely material to end up being recycled AND the material holds its intrinsic value time after time, a key to true sustainability.
3rd Pure copper is more expensive and lightweight than brass and bronze.

No other bag incorporates military features into high-end, full-featured business briefcases. It's an awesome look, no doubt. But there's more to Matador than good style.Brand Inspirations:
We are inspired by the sacrifices our men and women in uniform make each and every day. It's truly awe-inspiring. 
On a more personal level, my Grandfather was a Paratrooper in the US Army during World War II. I've always felt a deep pride knowing how important his service was and what it meant to him.In years past, I worked in financial services serving companies in the defense industry. I had the privilege to work alongside a number of ex-military folks who started their own businesses. Seeing the work they put into building and growing awesome companies has always stuck with me.
The Matador Advantages:Selling direct to the consumer allows us to cut out the middleman and sell our products at sensible price pointsOur products are produced by our carefully selected manufacturing partners, ensuring the highest quality build for every item we makeAfter production is completed, our products will ship directly to a fulfillment center where they will be housed and orders will be processedProducts will then be delivered directly to our customersNo middlemen.

Our wallet has a durable nylon exterior and a smooth leather interior
The Outpost - Packed and ReadyWe infuse traditional business accessories with military-inspired design elementsWe combine modern briefcase styling with tactical design elements for bold products that look great in an office or anywhere else your work takes youOur styling is influenced by the Modular Lightweight Load-carrying Equipment used by the US military. This can be seen in our subtle use of nylon webbing on the exteriors of our bagsOur bags are produced by a manufacturer that specializes in military gear. So all of our products are built to the highest standards of qualityOur collection is designed for business and built to last.The GarrisonOur Bags:Each bag has a secure compartment for a 15 inch laptop with plenty of room for additional files and accessories.There are specialized slots for business cards, smart phones, tablets, and more.Our briefcases have detachable shoulder straps and comfortable, leather-lined handles.And each bag slides over a luggage handle so you can easily take it with you when you travel.The Flagship:

other small brands.

<br/>We have a proven record of producing top quality watches, evidence of this can be found on our testimonials page <a href=""http://saswatchco.com/testimonials"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://saswatchco.com/testimonials</a> and on our customer photos page <a href=""http://saswatchco.com/news/gallery/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://saswatchco.com/news/gallery/</a></p>
<p>We have a great relationship with our different suppliers, and 
manufacturers, and many of the details of this watch have already been 
discussed and worked out, so we can get started straight away. </p>
<p>So with all our suppliers in place and our proven track record of 
producing top quality watches we can say this is a very low risk 
investment.</p><p><br/></p>
<p>Challenges
<br/>The only challenge is the production time frame. Producing 
everything from scratch and the extra time involved with molds and 
machining can give us a longer production time, but we will keep you 
updated as we progress, and try to make the time fly.</p>
<p>
<br/>All the images of the new watch are computer generated, the reason 
for this is we have no prototypes at this stage, we only have the 
computer models. 
<br/>The computer models that we generate are taken from the same files 
that we use for the production, so they are a good representation of the
 finished watch. The photographs that you see are taken of our previous 
model the SEA-01, as they share many of the same components and give a 
good guide to the new model. As we progress, we will add photographs of 
the new components.</p>

<p></p></div>","Welcome to the Indiegogo campaign for SAS Watch Company Ltd. We are
 a small watch company located in Ireland, producing professional grade 
watches. On offer here is our new model the SEA-02 
As we progress with the production we will add photos of the new model. 
There is more information about us at the end of this page and if you 
have any questions about us or the new model, please feel free to email 
us sea2@saswatchco.com We would like to introduce our new anti-magnetic professional diver: the SEA-02, the long awaited follow up to the SEA-01. The SEA-02 encompasses everything that the SEA-01 was and more, from a
 more ergonomic design and a slightly smaller case size, the SEA-02 is 
the perfect everyday watch. We got a lot of emails from people looking 
for a smaller version of the SEA-01 so, we set out with the case and 
reduced it from 44mm diameter to a 42mm diameter, reduced the lug width 
from 24mm to 22mm and we have incorporated a double domed sapphire 
crystal.  Every element of this watch is designed by us using the
 latest technology, it is manufactured to the highest standards and 
assembled here, in Ireland, by hand. Every watch is also regulated and 
tested thoroughly before it leaves. We are offering two versions of this watch: a black dial version or a blue dial version.  The black is a matt black and the blue is nice dark navy blue.Both will have a metal bracelet, a rubber strap and a tool for swapping the straps. The recommended retail price for this watch will be €900,(€1,107 incl. VAT - EU only)but we are offering it here for €550 (€676.50 incl. VAT - EU only)or get both for €1000 (€1,230 incl. VAT - EU only) (*the prices are set in Euro but I believe you will see them in your currency) Best of both worlds.  The SEA-02 is the first Irish 
Made Professional divers watch on the market. This is something we have 
been working towards for the last number of years. But we know you want 
more, so on the inside we are using trusted Swiss movements. This is our first Indigogo campaign and we want to do something 
special so we are keeping this special edition a limited run. We are 
only making this version available here and you say how many are in the 
limited edition.  Once we pass the targeted amount we will only 
produce the amount backed. So if there are only 200 backers then we will
 only produce 200, or if there are 2000 then that is the amount we will 
make.  The caseback will be engraved with “Special Edition” and 
will have the serial number starting at 0001/???? (the ???? will be 
replaced with the final amount when the campaign finishes). 
To make it as fair as possible we will give the serial number in the 
order of when it was backed. The case diameter is 42mm x 49mm with 22mm lugs. The height is a very
 comfortable 13.5mm from the bottom of the caseback to the top of the 
domed sapphire crystal. The strap width is 22mm. The case is made from 316L stainless steel and is 
finished in a brushed effect and has a polished top edge. The underneath
 is curved to sit comfortably on your wrist and the edges rounded for 
maximum comfort.The crystal is a double domed sapphire. We are using a double dome to 
eliminate distortion when the watch is viewed from an angle and we are 
using sapphire crystal for its hardness and scratch resistant 
properties.  The crystal also has an anti-reflective coating.The crystal is held in place with a screwed-in locking ring to prevent 
it popping out during decompression on commercial saturation dives.  The rotating bezel is the most important feature for divers. It is used 
to time dives and is used as a back up to computers. The bezel rotates 
anticlockwise and with 120 clicks it is easy to line up with the hour 
hand. We design everything to be tough and durable and this especially goes 
for the bezel. We have deep etched the top and coated this area with 
black PVD. This means no matter how tough you are on your watch the 
bezel will always be easily read. We have changed the design very slightly over the old model, we have 
added minute marks all the way around to make it easier for divers to 
time their dives.Accuracy and durability matter so we have chosen the outstanding 
Swiss made SW200 movement. This movement is the work horse of the Swiss 
watch industry and parts are easily obtained, meaning it can be serviced
 long into the future by any good watchmaker.  The SW200 is a 26 
jewel automatic mechanical movement, it runs on the movement of your 
wrist, and it has a 38 hour power reserve.This watch uses a mechanical movement and all mechanical movements are 
prone to magnetism. Elements such as the hair spring can get magnetized

incorporated a shield around the movement made of Mu-metal. Mu-metal is a
 soft iron that is commonly used in magnetic shielding. This watch is capable of reaching depths of 500 meters, and can be used 
by both scuba divers as well as professional commercial saturation 
divers. We use Viton rubber seals to ensure there are no leaks. We use sandwich construction on the dial. The dial is made up of 2 
parts, the top section that has the cut-outs and a bottom section that 
contains the luminescent material. We use Superluminova BGW9 which is 
one of the brightest on the market, it is white during the day and gives
 off a blueish green glow at night.  The design is based on our 
previous model the SEA-01 but we have removed the date to give the dial a
 more balanced look. This version is limited and it is only available 
here on Indigogo. We are offering two colour options: a matt black dial and a deep blue dial.This photo is from our SEA-01 modelThe hand designs are a direct descendant from the SEA-01 and use the 
same BGW9 lume as the dial. They are easily read, both during the day 
and during the night. They are made from silver to catch the light and 
the centre section is black to match the dial to give the hands a 
floating effect around the dial.  Every detail is scrutinized 
right down to the hundredth of a millimeter, including the exact length 
of the hands and the placement of the point of the minute and second 
hands on the minute track. The bracelet is an important element in the design, it has to be strong,
 comfortable, adjustable and look good from the depths of the ocean to 
the board room. We are using a “beads of rice” style band and a clasp 
that incorporates a ratcheting diver’s extension.  This is a 22mm version of our popular premium rubber strap. The strap is
 made from natural rubber and is sourced from the leading manufacturer 
in rubber straps. The straps are designed by us and are inspected at 
every stage by us to ensure quality and suppleness.  At SAS we want you to keep your watch and know that the weakest part of 
any watch are those little spring bars that hold the strap on to your 
watch. We hate them, they are unreliable, weak and when one breaks your 
watch is on the floor, or worse, the bottom of the ocean.  So we use screwbars, 1.9mm thick bars with Allen key heads. These make changing straps easy and secure, using the provided tool. Every watch comes with a two-year warranty. The watch is presented in our leather bound box and includes the watch, 
metal bracelet, rubber strap, tool for changing straps, cleaning cloth 
and warranty card. We are SAS Watch Company Ltd http://saswatchco.com.
 We launched our first model the SEA-01 back in 2008. The SEA-01 was a 
1000 meter professional divers watch and was a great success and 
launched us into the watch world.  It was followed up by the AIR 
series which used the same case design but without the rotating bezel to
 give it a more elegant look. We also set up a second brand name Míleata http://mileata.com, this is a striped down military watch. It’s tough and durable and designed to meet the requirements of military personnel. 
We are very much about form and function while focusing on strength and 
durability. We design all the components of the case, dials, crystals, 
etc. and do not use off the shelf cases that you will find in a lot of 
other small brands.
Risks
We have a proven record of producing top quality watches, evidence of this can be found on our testimonials page http://saswatchco.com/testimonials and on our customer photos page http://saswatchco.com/news/gallery/
We have a great relationship with our different suppliers, and 
manufacturers, and many of the details of this watch have already been 
discussed and worked out, so we can get started straight away. 
So with all our suppliers in place and our proven track record of 
producing top quality watches we can say this is a very low risk 
investment.
Challenges
The only challenge is the production time frame. Producing 
everything from scratch and the extra time involved with molds and 
machining can give us a longer production time, but we will keep you 
updated as we progress, and try to make the time fly.

All the images of the new watch are computer generated, the reason 
for this is we have no prototypes at this stage, we only have the 
computer models. 
The computer models that we generate are taken from the same files 
that we use for the production, so they are a good representation of the
 finished watch. The photographs that you see are taken of our previous 
model the SEA-01, as they share many of the same components and give a 
good guide to the new model. As we progress, we will add photographs of 
the new components.
Thank you for reading this far :-) and thank you for your interest in our brand.To learn a bit more about us here are a few photographs of our previous watches.",70.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h3> <p>My name is Tineke, and I'm setting up my own clothing brand. My concept: I want people to feel good about who they are and what they look like, to grow more confident, and not be afraid to speak up. To achieve this, I will need your help. More specifically, I have designed quirky cat prints, and I need money to fund them with. I am in touch with a printing company that works with several well-known Belgian fashion designers, and figured out they will charge approximately €18/m - €22 VAT included.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>For my project, as I mentioned, I need about €1800 for 70m of fabric. On this fabric, I will have one print printed, and I will be able to make about 60 tops out of it. I will make several types of tops, and put them in my store on speakupfashion.be. If you decide on funding me, I can tell you that I will make one contribution of €60 count as a pre-order. You will be able to get one free top or T-shirt from my store, according to the models I have drawn. Of course, if you contribute €120 or another multiple of €60, you will get a multiple of free shirts. If you have any questions, you can tweet me at @SpeakUpFashion, or post on my Facebook wall. I am still in the process of having my E-mail address configured.<br/></p>
<p>If I don't get to reach my goal, you will get your money back, and I will have to find a different way to get my prints printed, as my margin is too small for what this website is charging me in return for partial fund payments. It's all or nothing :-)<br/></p>
<p>Also, if you decide to contribute less than €60, I'll give you a store discount and a shoutout! I need some capital for my startup, meaning in the end, I should be left with more than enough to refund all of you.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>I want to see confident people, happy kids, and smiles on everyone's faces. Customers will be able to choose their own models, according to the way they are built (I can give some advice, when desired for), so they can flaunt their figures and show off what they have. Feel beautiful. Be beautiful. Have the confidence to speak up!<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>The biggest risk, to me, is not finding customers. I hope, by offering discounts and free T-shirts, to get people excited about my project, build up clientele, gain publicity, and get started. There are no risks for you; if I don't get to reach my goal, you will get a full refund.<br/>

<p>Each attachment features four strong magnets located on the four corners of the gadget. The top of each plate has a pivot point that protrudes slightly from the surface. The bottom of each plate has an exact same point that sinks into the surface (much like a LEGO). These features, along with the magnets, allow the gadgets to snap together and stay perfectly aligned. The entire thickness of all four modules connected together is only 3/4 of an inch. </p>
<p><i><b>The Multi-Tool is the only gadget that does not have magnets on the four corners. This can be done because of a special type of stainless steel that is magnetic. </b></i></p>

<h1>Where The Funds Are Going</h1>
<p>$20,000 seems like a huge number, but we need every bit of it to 
get the best possible pricing for our backers. The more we raise, the 
better the quality and price of our product will be. That being said, 
you're probably wondering where its all going? Here's the current 
breakdown of what we're going to use the funds for:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>4% to Indiegogo. They have to make money too. About $800 will be

<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<div>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>How do I select what color I want?</b></p>
<p>We will contact you at the end of the campaign to record your color choices. The Multi-Tool is the only attachment that does not have a color choice. This is because it is stainless steel so it can't really be colored.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Can I change my perk?</b></p>
<p>Unfortunately, not during the campaign. Each contribution made is recorded as a separate contribution with a separate perk. If you would like to receive a new perk, you can do this in a separate contribution.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>I forgot to pay for international shipping. What should I do?</b></p>
<p>No problem. We've teamed up with BackerKit to get your product to you as fast as possible. After the campaign, they will email you to finalize the details. If you owe any remaining balances, they will notify you. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Can I get multiple perks?</b></p>
<p>Yes! You can back our campaign as many times as you want, choosing as many perks as you want. Once BackerKit emails you to finalize information, you can also choose to add additional perks from the email. </p>
<p><b>How do I select which connector I want for the phone charger?</b></p>
<p>At the end of the campaign we will ask each backer what phone charger model they want. The Micro-USB or the Apple Lightning. </p>
<p><b>How strong will the magnets hold the attachments together?</b></p>
<p>The magnetic strength contained in the rare earth magnets we use is very strong, but only when the magnets come into contact with each other. This makes it hard to pull the attachments straight off, but rather easy to twist them off. </p>
<p><b>Will the magnets damage my phone or credit card?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The short answer: no they won't. The magnets are strong when connected to other magnets, however, by themselves they don't emit a strong enough magnetic field to be destructive. Phones are only destroyed by magnets if they are industrial sized magnets (these small magnets don't even come close). [<a href=""http://blog.first4magnets.com/will-a-magnet-damage-my-smartphone/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://blog.first4magnets.com/will-a-magnet-dam...</a>]</p>
<p>Credit cards are a different issue. For a credit card's information to be wiped it would have to come into direct contact with the magnet and actually be rubbed until it was unreadable. All together your credit cards will be perfectly safe inside the wallet as the magnets are not strong enough to get past the aluminum casing they are pressed into. </p>

</div></div>","- Proto is a combination of gadgets that you choose to carry with you throughout the day. Each one is different. Each one can be customized. How you build your wallet is up to you.









              We're constantly coming up with cool inventions that we use personally everyday. So we thought maybe other people would like them too? ""Proto"" is an idea that came to us when we were trying to solve the problem of every gadget coming in its own shape and bulky size. 

            

              If I wanted to carry a charger for my phone, a bottle opener, or something for my keys then I would probably run out of space in my pockets. That's where our idea came in. We designed gadgets - from the ground up - to all be the same size and as thin and durable as possible.
Proto is unlike anything on the market. It gives you the ability to choose what you want to carry, and when you want to carry it. Not going to a place where you need your keys? Leave the key holder attachment at home. Don't need your wallet with you? Simply detach it and toss it aside. With the many color choices available, your Proto Wallet is completely customizable and tailored to your lifestyle






















Each attachment features four strong magnets located on the four corners of the gadget. The top of each plate has a pivot point that protrudes slightly from the surface. The bottom of each plate has an exact same point that sinks into the surface (much like a LEGO). These features, along with the magnets, allow the gadgets to snap together and stay perfectly aligned. The entire thickness of all four modules connected together is only 3/4 of an inch. 
The Multi-Tool is the only gadget that does not have magnets on the four corners. This can be done because of a special type of stainless steel that is magnetic. 
Weight Comparison: The four modules connected together weight in at approximately 7.1 oz. (201.3 g). 
-Magnets: To learn how the magnets won't affect your credit card or phone, check the FAQ at the bottom of the page












The whole purpose of a portable phone charger is to be able to charge your phone on the go. So why should you have to carry around a four foot phone cable with it? We didn't think you should, which is why the phone charger we designed has its own cable built into the device. It will be able to accurately and quickly recharge your phone from its lithium-ion rechargeable battery. We have designed two models - one with an Apple Lightning Connector, and one with a Micro-USB Connector. We've also included an ultra bright LED flashlight on the opposite end of the charger, just because we could. 

Size: 4 x 2.375 x 1/4 inch (101.6 x 60.33 x 6.35 mm)
Shell: Anodized aluminum
Battery: Lithium Polymer
Battery Capacity: 2000 mAh +
Connection Type: Micro-USB (compatible with all Android phones) 
or Apple Lightning Connector (compatible with iPhone 5, 5S, 6) 
Weight: approx. 2.3 oz. (65.2 g)


Forged out of strong stainless steel and given a close brushed finish, the Multi-Tool not only adds functionality to your everyday carry but also elegance in its design. Featuring a bottle opener, ten hex nut fasteners (five in metric and five in english), a protractor, and a straight edge with both centimeter and inch markings - the Multi-Tool will be sure to impress. Think of something you'd like to see included on the Multi-Tool? Be sure to let us know and we'll consider adding it to the design!


Size: 4 x 2.375 x 1/16 inch (101.6 x 60.33 x 1.59 mm)
Material: Stainless Steel (Magnetic)
Finish: Brushed with laser engraved markings
Weight: approx. 1.6 oz. (45.4 g) 







CNC machined from anodized aluminum, the key holder proves to be a unique alternative to carrying your keys - allowing you to quickly add and remove the keys that you use on a regular basis. The four machined key slots on the ends of the key holder provide an easy means of storing the keys you use everyday. The design of the key holder and the strength at which it will hold the keys you place into it means that you are no longer sacrificing functionality for personality. 

Size:4 x 2.375 x 3/16 inch (101.6 x 60.33 x 4.76 mm)
Shell: Anodized aluminum
Key Capacity: Four standard keys 
Weight: approx. 1.6 oz. (45.4 g)





The Proto wallet combines what everyone wants to see in a minimalist, functional product. Using high quality elastic paired with anodized aluminum plates, the Proto wallet ensures that your valuables remain safe while keeping its sleek profile. Designed to expand, the wallet will be able to hold one card as easily as it holds many. The unique shape means that accessing your money and cards is as easy as sliding them out after breaking the magnetic connection. 

                                                           

Size:4 x 2.375 x 1/4 inch (101.6 x 60.33 x 6.35 mm)
Shell: Anodized aluminum
Internal: Three high-quality elastic bands 
Weight: approx. 1.6 oz. (45.4 g)










Our Team


We are a team of mechanical engineers with a goal of developing exciting new products for consumers. We are located in Toledo, Ohio and attend the University of Toledo. We have spent nearly a year in the design and preparation stage of our product in order to make sure everything runs as seamless as possible. With your help, we will pay for manufacturing costs and make this product a reality. 





Where The Funds Are Going
$20,000 seems like a huge number, but we need every bit of it to 
get the best possible pricing for our backers. The more we raise, the 
better the quality and price of our product will be. That being said, 
you're probably wondering where its all going? Here's the current 
breakdown of what we're going to use the funds for:


4% to Indiegogo. They have to make money too. About $800 will be 
paid to Indiegogo for allowing us to use their site to reach backers. 
86% to manufactures for tooling costs and parts. Some of our 
products require little to no tooling costs, however, the ones that do 
are expensive. About $17,200 will be paid to manufactures for tooling 
costs and initial product costs. 
10% for shipping. $2,000 will be paid for shipping charges and 
warehouse costs. We're outsourcing our shipping so that our product can 
reach backers as quick as possible.

We can´t wait. :)</p></div>","INLU creates playful shoes handcrafted by exceptionally talented Portuguese artisans. Did you know almost all the top-end brands manufacture in Portugal? Nature was our inspiration, together with a promising material: the highly versatile cork. Our first collection is composed of men’s derbies and women’s mules and boots. With several variations and a multitude of colours, INLU shoes are perfect for those who love their style to exude personality.MAN DERBIESThese versatile lace-up derbies fuse premium Italian leather with fine Portuguese cork fabric. Wear them with or without fringes depending on your look of the day. The soles are made of a lightweight microfibre combined with an outsole grip of 100% rubber for more traction and resistance in everyday wear.WOMAN MULESOur pointed toe slip-on mules are handcrafted in Portugal. A trendy style that seamlessly combines premium leather with vibrant coloured cork fabric, as well as soft suede and an innovative new material made out of cork sand and silver glitter. They also come with a leather contrast color lining and cushioned insole for extra comfort. Heel height: 1cm.WOMAN BOOTSThese timeless round toe medium heel boots will grant you a standout look. The fun combination of materials and contrast colours make these boots impossible to miss. They are finished with a fine leather sole and elegant gold zipper closure on the side. Heel height: 5cm. Designed to be a classic round toe low heel ankle boot with a refreshing twist, our bootie boots are the perfect balance between flair and simplicity. They have a gold zipper closure and INLU's statement contrast color lining. Heel height: 1cm.If you are looking for shoes that are stylish, comfortable, affordable that use high-end raw materials, INLU is your perfect match.1. NATURAL AND RECYCABLE MATERIAL - CORKCombining cork with leather gave us the opportunity to present shoes with a modern twist. Cork is light, durable, soft and recyclable. Our top Portuguese partner knows how to explore cork’s true potential and to create our unique colors. 2. 1 PAIR OF SHOES = 1 TREEBack in the summer of 2017, Portugal had a tragic year concerning summer fires where more than 750 thousand acres of forest were lost and more than 100 people’s lives were taken. INLU made the commitement of planting one tree per each pair sold, and so joined Plant a Tree, a Portuguese NGO that develops a volunteer program dedicated to promoting and conserving the Portuguese native forest, as well as the indigenous plant species. 3. FAIR TRADE + TRANSPARENCYOur values are clear: collaboration, respect, trust, quality, kindness. We want to do the right things in the right way. Not the cheap way, nor the fast way. We are actively part of the #FashionRevolution international movement, showing you not only the hands but also the faces of our Portuguese talent. Skilled artisans create our shoes in Portugal. We stand for a high standard of ethics, fair salaries, and humanism in the workplace, so we joined the #FashionRevolution movement.These are the faces of our dream team – all strong and determined women totally committed to the brand.Inês Lebre has an extensive background in Consultancy and Entrepreneurship. The concept of INLU came from a deep desire to create a brand based on offbeat designs using unique materials, and crafted in her home country, Portugal.Ana Fatia is an industrial designer; she thrives on the art of transforming raw materials. Ana was recognized as a young talent in 2012 during Milano Design Week and at ""Now! Le off!,"" the Cité de la Mode et du Design on Paris Design Week.As Rita Pinho puts it, “all I know is how to make shoes.” Rita makes sure her father's craftsmanship legacy stays alive and that their factory incorporate the most innovative processes and machines. Her international clients, with no exception, value the consistency in their quality, and so does INLU.It took us 9 months to get here. After all, developing a new idea and bringing it to life is never easy. Once we get the funds from Indiegogo and your email with the order specifications, we can focus on the production. March 2019 is the latest date we expect to ship. Our partner is DHL express so once we send it from Portugal you can count on a delivery from 1-2 working days. Fast right?The more you back, the more environmentally friendly we can be. If we reach $ 250,000, then 16,000 trees will be planted. Can you imagine? And for each stretch goal, we have compelling surprises, such as more variations and colours, an exclusive pair of socks and the ability to vote on the models of the '19 collection. The earlier you buy, the bigger is the discount you get. If you can grab one of the first 120 limited super early birds you get 50% off retail price. If you couldn't grab the first 120, you can always buy early bird at an also interesting 35% off. A very cool option is to join a friend and get 40% off for 2 pairs or if you convince your entire family or group of friends to get the 45% or the 50% for 4 or 9 pairs. Go ahead, don't be shy. All of our shoes fit true to size. If you take a half-size, please go up to the nearest whole size.

<p>F&amp;W Style owner, Alexandria started her passion for fashion at age ten, when she persuaded her mother to let her be an assistant at her Fashion Design Studio everyday after school. At that young age she learned a lot about design and running a fashion business. At the age of thirteen her family moved from Nigeria to Atlanta, Georgia and she started her modeling career. She modeled for major companies throughout the South. As her modeling career advanced she fell in love with the beauty and glamour of the industry, she fell in love with the well crafted luxurious Items specifically handbags that she got to wear as a model. But soon she realized that most women including her could not afford the luxurious accessories and clothing that she modeled in magazines and on the runway. After earning her Masters Degree in Business Administration in 2008, she decided to put her educational background with her years of experience in the fashion industry and create a luxurious brand for the busy woman on the go. With the support her husband Alfred Alli, F&amp;W Style was born.

Only limited privileged individuals who can afford up-scaled treatments are immune from it. Therefore dealing with ""WET"" acoustic guitars has become our obsession. Eventually we created the KILN.""the KILN"" Website: http://www.thekiln.sg/The KILN is the world's first guitar dehumidifier that employs 3 key principles of wood drying:
Constant heat supply
Heated environment
Air circulation
Using the KILN is as easy as ABC!Simply insert the KILN into your guitar soundhole (not for offset soundhole guitars), turn on the power, and leave it over night (8 hours) and it will be done!See the illustrations below and you will be amazed with how simple the KILN works!See step by step illustration below.The KILN will not mark your beloved guitarsProtective felt layers have been strategically placed on the KILN so that it leaves no marks on your beloved guitar.The KILN dehumidifies by three key wood drying principlesFirst Principle - Constant Heat SupplyThe KILN supplies constant heat to your guitar soundbox.

A team of Industrial Designers were appointed and in October 2012 project ""the KILN"" was kick started.Trimming the divergence of ideas into a few preferred forms.The preferred ones…Arguably laying out the electrical components was one of the toughest challenges we faced thus far. The team would like ""the KILN"" to be compact and slick. These requirements have created challenges in finding space to house the electrical components. The team of Industrial Designers were fully stretched.Adam and Samuel recognized that visual impression is critical to users' acceptance to the product. The team of Industrial Designers have spared no efforts in creating rendered images to create the necessary visual impact. Below are four of many rendered images to aid them in visualizing the product appearances.Brain-storming continued. Adam and Samuel worked with the team of Industrial Designers to narrow the best suited and workable designs. Below are two final proposals and Adam and Samuel have selection the design on the left which is proposal 1.Among guitar enthusiasts, the love for guitars is often communicated through the beauty extroverted from the curves and shapes on guitars. Invariably, certain visual cues were incorporated that speak to guitar enthusiasts. The team want these features to give feelings of familiarity and comfort to guitar enthusiasts. Below are some examples of such features.Apart from aesthetic quality, the team wanted to ensure ""the KILN"" ease of assembly during production phase. The matings of parts within were carefully designed with many technical and manufacturing considerations.Finally, Adam and Samuel have narrowed down to Design Proposal 01. The path towards the selected design was indeed exciting.A well designed product will not go without quality packaging. Likewise, the Industrial Designers maintained their high standards of delivery.Finally the Industrial Design phase was concluded in December 2013. The final design embodied the KILN's operating principles, functional features, ergonomics design and aesthetics value. The team was delighted with the outcome.Full Functional PrototypingAdam was well aware of guitar enthusiasts' love for their guitars. Therefore no compromise was allowable. The team went ahead to make fully functional prototypes to validate our design concepts.Certain issues were surfaced when prototypes were made. The heat produced by the heating element was sufficient to soften the plastic housing. Immediately the Industrial Designers switched to plastics of higher heat resistance properties. To facilitate injection molding, the team made design changes to some plastic parts. There were others… the team tackled them one at a time with opened minds.After a few prototypes, the team managed to eradicate the detected issues. The prototypes were subjected to further validation tests. Picture below is prototype 001.The above and below two pictures showed prototype 001 being subject to validation tests.Multiple sensors were positioned within and outside the test guitars. We were delighted with the temperature and humidity readings. We concluded that prototype 001 has arrived.""the KILN"" Production ForecastAccompanied by a few appointed Industrial Designers, Adam and Samuel have visited potential manufacturers in Malaysia. It was after a process of needs analysis that the supply chain was established. ""the KILN"" has arrived to turnkey stage. The only ingredient current is adequate funding.This campaign is planned for 55 days. Here is our estimated schedule of production and delivery of our promises.1. At the end of this campaign, the first-batch production requires 14 to 16 weeks to complete.2. Shipping out our promises will take 1 to 3 weeks.3. It should take from 23 to 26 weeks to get your rewards. We will expedite the process whenever we can.In relating the production milestones to funding quantum, here is a brief summary,1. USD $77,000 will be able to make all the essential toolings2. USD $155,000 will be able to kick start the first-batch production cycles to fulfill our promises.3. USD $210,00 will be able to create more ""the KILN"" to reach out to more guitar enthusiasts in the world.We definitely need your support to materialize our plans and dreams. Please contribute in anyways you can.Handcrafted PerksWe value your contributions. The founder of Guitaring Passionately will undertake the entire crafting of these perks personally. Assuredly no effort will be spared to make them good.Handmade GuitarThe picture below depicts a handmade guitar made by Adam. If you become a contributor of this perk, you will be receiving a guitar of the like.Wood PicksThe wood picks will be made from blackwood and maple. They are built to last yet aesthetically pleasing. Again they will be handcrafted by Adam.",34.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p><span>Hey Everybody!  You’ve either landed on this page either by mistake or accident,you have an interest in fashion or you are following a link from my youtube channel  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/clothespindolls"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://www.youtube.com/clothespindolls</span></a></span><span>  or website <a href=""http://sugarplumdolls.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://sugarplumdolls.com</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>Over the last couple of years I began posting “how-to” arts and crafts videos to show people how easy it is to make things! If I say the response has been overwhelming that would be an understatement. After getting  over  1,000,000 video views</span><span>  and gaining thousands of subscribers I knew it was time to take the next exciting step! The “</span><span>SugarplumDolls.com Sew Simple Pattern Project”</span><span>  </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>I am now ready to take a leap forward and launch my own line of super easy sewing patterns. My plan is  to create super easy sewing patterns, I hope to have my first pattern available for sale online before Christmas  2012 in my etsy shop. <a href=""http://www.etsy.com/shop/clothespindolls"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://www.etsy.com/shop/clothespindolls</span></a></span><span> </span><span>I need to raise money to help offset the cost of having my pattern digitized, graded, and  printed !</span></p>
<div><span> </span></div>
<div>
<h3>Why this is important</h3>
<p><span>This project is important to me because “I really want everyone” to experience the joy of actually making something with their own two hands”! To create and make is simply human nature! I want  everyone who wants to learn how to sew  to be able to  purchase a pattern, take it home and actually make something cute!  Beginners who want to sew should be able to create something they are proud of without having to have a fashion degree!  So many times people purchase sewing patterns and never end up making anything or start a project and never seem to finish it.  </span></p>
<p> I started researching this project and I've looked at hundreds of sewing patterns, design books made sketches, and samples and finally I have created a few super easy sewing patterns that anyone can make into beautiful children's clothes!  For now I am focusing on children's clothes because they don't required an expensive amount of fabric or materials and most items can be made in an afternoon. With my patterns and basic or little sewing skills almost anyone something very wearable.  Based on the popularity of my youtube channel <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/clothespindolls"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://www.youtube.com/clothespindolls</span></a> , many people have learned how to make things and gone on to even create their own small home based businesses, selling hair bows, tutus or dolls.  Another perk with my patterns is that people who purchase a pattern can make multiple items to sell as long as they include one of my  labels into each item! This will allow people who are starting their own business the opportunity to produce a quality product and not worry about the high cost licensing fees and it also will help to supplement my creating more fabulous patterns.</p>
<div><span> </span></div>
<h3>What the money is for</h3>
<p><span>After speaking with printers, I have learned that print house minimums are 1,000 pieces per style. While the cost per pattern isn’t that high, when you multiply it times 1,000 pieces, it gets expensive really quickly! And that’s just the printed patterns! I also need the instruction sheets and illustrations, as well as photos of the finished items for people to see what they’ll be making. Once totaled, it will cost about $3,500 per design to launch a commercially available </span><span>SugarplumDolls.com Sew Simple Pattern  </span><span>sewing pattern.</span></p>
<p><span>For the </span><span>SugarplumDolls.com Sew Simple Pattern Project </span><span>, I’m hoping to raise $3500, which is enough for me to launch the first  of hopefully an entire collection of sewing patterns! Now, on the off chance that you help me get beyond the first $3500, each additional $3500 raised equals another pattern design. So if I am so lucky as to make my goal, it doesn’t have to end there!</span></p>
<p><span>No donation is too small!</span></p>

<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p><span>What better perk can you get  other than the actual pattern?  Depending on your pledge level you will receive  a pattern professionally printed  </span><span>, a set of paper doll dresses which emulate and give you a sneak peak at my entire collection of patterns, and everyone who donates gets a hand written thank you note from me, as well as acknowledgment on my website.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>And just to let you know how serious I am about  my </strong></span><span>SugarplumDolls.com Sew Simple Pattern Project </span><span><strong>If i do not make my goal I will not  keep any of the money</strong>, as without the money I cannot create any of the patterns or  the perks!</span></p>

<p>With a combined 25 years of design and manufacturing experience between us, it was clear that we didn't need to deal with the impractical, bulky wallets much longer. We could design and produce the perfect wallet. And that's exactly what we set out to do. Through trial and error, we finally landed on a design that is perfect for minimalists, like ourselves, who like to carry the necessary and ditch the bulk. After finalizing the design, We made some samples that we gave away to family and friends. It's over a year later, and everyone is still as happy with the prototypes today as they were when they first saw them. We've even heard the Slickon samples are great conversation starters – because everyone wants to know where they can get one of their own.</p>
<p><strong>THE PLAN</strong></p>
<p>The funds raised through this project will be used for tooling , produce the Slickon wallet line, which includes 6 different wallet styles. <br/>Funding will help us produce a large-scale production run, including supply costs.<br/>We have good relationship with the manufacturer and supplier of silicon<br/>material and are confident that our supplier is capable of producing <br/>Slickon wallets even if we get over funded for larger scale of production.<br/>Shipping of large quantity is going to be fulfilled with professional fulfillment  center .</p>

<p></p>
<h3>Risks and challenges </h3>
<p>The challenges of Slickon Wallets will be getting the word out, and convincing crowdfunders to participate. With so many great projects to choose from, We hope ours will stand apart from the rest. To reach as many people as possible, we are asking friends, families, and various blogs, to help spread the word.</p>
<p>Once the funding is in place, the challenge will be producing on a large scale. Depending on outside help is difficult, but we have been dealing with a manufacturer for months and have established a solid relationship, which has has given us a lot of confidence in them.</p>

After those intense but life-changing months, we both agreed that mainstream society is loosing its essence, its traditions and customs. So we asked ourselves, why not create a reminiscence of our origins for this globalized world?  </p><p>But let us take you back a couple of years, before designing our Ethnic Watches, as without going through this process, we wouldn't be able to guarantee that we have the best specs in the market for quarz watches and the lowest prices. During these years we have attended watch fairs, sold different watch qualities and asked our customers for their feedback which has alllowed us to offer the perfect timepiece. We are true believers that Luxury doesn't have to be expensive, and that top quality is a must. </p><p>In 2016 we put together, both our professional and personal experience to create a timepiece that the world hadn't seen before. A luxury watch that combined modern elegance with traditional colors and patterns. A timepiece that would remind us of our origins, traditions, customs and specially of those that are fighting to preserve them. We took inspiration from indigenous people and ethnic tribes and decided to speak out for them. Thanks to our NGO partners Survival International and Kubuka we are able to help them and protect them against fierce governments which are taking away their land and way of living. </p><p>We believe that everyone should have the right to be who they are, without being forced into a society or group where they don't belong.

After those intense but life-changing months, we both agreed that mainstream society is loosing its essence, its traditions and customs. So we asked ourselves, why not create a reminiscence of our origins for this globalized world?  But let us take you back a couple of years, before designing our Ethnic Watches, as without going through this process, we wouldn't be able to guarantee that we have the best specs in the market for quarz watches and the lowest prices. During these years we have attended watch fairs, sold different watch qualities and asked our customers for their feedback which has alllowed us to offer the perfect timepiece. We are true believers that Luxury doesn't have to be expensive, and that top quality is a must. In 2016 we put together, both our professional and personal experience to create a timepiece that the world hadn't seen before. A luxury watch that combined modern elegance with traditional colors and patterns. A timepiece that would remind us of our origins, traditions, customs and specially of those that are fighting to preserve them. We took inspiration from indigenous people and ethnic tribes and decided to speak out for them. Thanks to our NGO partners Survival International and Kubuka we are able to help them and protect them against fierce governments which are taking away their land and way of living. We believe that everyone should have the right to be who they are, without being forced into a society or group where they don't belong. For this reason our motto is ""Be Your True Self"". We have chosen the best specs in the market to be able to offer a 10 years warranty with every Ethnic Watch. Our ultra-thin 316L Stainless Steel case is the perfect fit for both men and women. These are our top-notch materials: - Plated 316L Stainless Steel case, buckle and crown which are polished until they gleam.- Swiss Ronda 762 movement, to ensure it's perfect functioning- Anti-Scratch Sapphire Crystal with Anti-Reflecting coating which protects your watchs' surface and enhances its durability. Sapphire is one of the hardest and most durable materials in the world.- Indexes and hands are polished in Gold, Silver and Rose Gold- 5 ATM / 50 meters Water Resistance- Sony Baterry- Interchangeable Italian full grain vegetable tanned leather straps with 100% cotton handcut ethnic textileOur ethnic straps are made out of the finest full grain Italian leather which offers a longer durability and a higher resistance to moisture. We use vegetable tanning, which is chromium free and has no harmful chemicals, having therefore a neutral effect on humans. This tanning method doesn’t only provide a more natural and organic texture, it also offers a higher durability and strength. The ethnic textile which is made out of first-class cotton is hand cut, making every strap unique. Unique fashion jewellery.Are you a true Zulu? The Zulus feel attached to their traditions, they are spiritual and put in the community’s needs before their own. If you feel like you identify with the Zulu tribe, this watch is for you.Are you a true Cherokee? The Cherokees are people of dialogue, they always try to reach consensus amongst their members. They are open minded and therefore adapt to any kind of circumstance. We absolutely love the way they are and how they confront life. Are you a true Samburu? The Samburus are undoubtedly authentic, constantly fighting to maintain their ancient traditions. They are known for their beauty and their distinct complements. They have definitely inspired us. Have they inspired you? Are you a true Kalam? The Kalams are very friendly and build strong relationships with the other members of their tribe. They all live together as one big family. They are also in love with nature. So are we! Are you a true Ndebele? The Ndebeles are superstitious, creative and independent. Their unique way of expressing themselves through art makes them one of a kind. Be unique with this exclusive collection. But we aren’t only a watch brand, we care about others!In mainstream society, when we talk about “progress"" and “development"", we unconsciously see it as something positive. But, we have to ask ourselves, is it always a positive change? Perhaps we should ask those people who are watching their land, rights, customs, values and local economies be destroyed in the name of progress. Industrialised societies forcing development and progress on tribal groups does not make them happier or healthier. In fact, the effects are disastrous and can lead to reduced life expectancy, starvation, obesity, depression, suicide, HIV/AIDs and addiction.  From the very beginning, it was clear to us that we wanted to help those who are constantly fighting for their ancestral lands and way of life. We decided for our first collection to take action and donate a % of our sales  to several NGOs who support them. However, we hope to contribute even more after our kickstarter campaign. Please feel free to check out their sites and learn more about their wonderful projects:    - Survival International, the global movement for tribal peoples’ rights https://www.survivalinternational.org  - Kubuka: http://www.kubuka.org/en/kubuka-2/We know that you have heard it before and from other Kickstarter Projects that ""Quality doesn't have to be expensive"", but we would like to explain why we can honestly offer such a low price for a luxurious timepiece.  INTERNET!

I already have business accounts set up with most shipping companies, and I will use the safest and most cost-efficient courier depending on the destination.I need your support!I am ready for production, I have the final prototypes, the technical drawing, and I have the manufacturer ready to begin production. The only thing missing is the initial order fee. I need to order a minimum of 300 watches to keep the price reasonable, and that is where you come in. By becoming a backer for my project, you will help me pay for the first production run, and in exchange you will receive an awesome watch at a highly discounted price!By pledging today, you are pre-ordering a Meanuere watch from the first production run and making sure you receive it as early as possible. You will offered the special Indiegogo price:The backers will get a watch for $59If you want two watches, then the backers will get two watches for $110 ($8 discount)My reach only goes as far as my network. Liking me on Facebook or sending a few quick emails to friends and family can go a long way to help me ensure success!I hope that you love my watches as much as I do and pledge your support in order to receive one of the very first production models from Meanuere!Thank you so much for being a part of this project!Risks and challengesI realize creating and delivering a product is a complicated process which often comes with unexpected hiccups. That is why I have been preparing.I have spent the past several months making sure my supply chain is in check. I have a well-established relationship working with a reliable watch manufacturer. I have experience and I have a contingency plan for all the steps that are out of my control. I am going to keep my backers informed during the production process. I will do this with regular updates and by sharing pictures as often as possible, for example when the watch cases are finished, after plating, during final assembly, when the final packing is printed, etc.If somewhere along the way, I find that there is a setback in production, or that I cannot make the timeline, I will be as open as possible and keep all of my backers informed.In the end, I want to make Meanuere a long-lasting brand of affordable luxury watches. I will do whatever it takes to fulfill my promises and to deliver watches that will exceed my backers’ expectations.P.S. Inspriational sources: Rossling and co's campaign on KickstarterCasioTimexDaniel WellingtonSeiko",10.0,0,"1 Campaign
