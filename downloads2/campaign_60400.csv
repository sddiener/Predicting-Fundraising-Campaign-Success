<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Henry Kiggundu (in white) and I am raising funds to help save my uncle's life (in pale blue shirt).  I am based in Boston now, and I come from a very humble family in Uganda. After my father's death in 2009, the head of the family became my uncle, Kyagulanyai.  Two weeks ago he was diagnosed with coronary artery disease, which means a clot in his main artery is threatening his life, constraining considerably his oxygen intake.  Right now he is only taking aspirin. He has developed high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol. He gets a sharp pain (angina) unpredictably and as a consequence he becomes diaphoresis (short of breath).  His legs are swelling and the doctors say that his heart will stop (develop myocardio infraction) at some point if he doesn't get treatment.  The treatment is a stent surgery which is standard in the US, but unavailable in Uganda.  Being a third world country there are no resources for this kind of surgery.  The closest country where the surgery can be performed is South Africa, but it is prohibitively expensive.  The best option is Bombay, India, where they would charge $5000 USD for the surgery.   </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We have tried so hard and managed to raise the money for the hotel in case he gets the surgery on time and generous people back home have offered to pay for the air tickets .  </p>
<p>I have personally $2000, a friend has given me $500, which means we need to raise $2500. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If you can contribute, even if it is $1, you would be helping to SAVE a life.   And his life means keeping one family and one community strong.  Kyagulanyai is a very kind and generous person. He has raised a family of 12 kids, always present, and has worked hard all his life (until he was asked to stop working because of his condition).  He is a member of 'Feed the Children' organisation, by helping collect food to deliver it to families that don't have the means.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get.</h3>
<h3><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;""> $5000 covers the surgery and post-op recovery. I am giving my savings of $2000 and a friend already gave me $500. That means that,</span></h3>
<p>we need only $2500.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This is what you get:</p>
<p>-  Should you be in Bakuli, Uganda at any point, one of my family members can be your tour guide. </p>
<p>-  I can offer free volleyball lessons. I used to play for the Uganda national team. The lessons can be either in person (if you live close to the Boston area) or by skype if you want some advice.</p>
<p>- I will cook you a homemade traditional Ugandan meal and/or teach you how to make it.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If for some reason we can not get all the money and my uncle does not get the surgery, all the money will be refunded. This is why we are asking for fixed funding.  </p>
<p><br/></p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please help me spread the word. If you have any ideas that can help save my uncle's life, please send them in.  We are in dear need. </p>

<strong>Qui sommes nous ? / </strong>About us</h2>
<p>Bonjour, je m'appelle Catherine j'ai 55 ans et suis infirmière de nuit depuis plus de 30ans. Je monte ce projet avec ma fille Floriane, 28 ans, aide soignante de nuit depuis presque 10ans.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hello, my name is Catherine I'm 55, I'm night nurse for over 30 years. I go up this project with my daughter Floriane, 28, nurse's aide at night for almost 10 years.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>
<strong>Que Présentons-nous ? / </strong>What do we want to do ?</h2>
<p>VOS JOURS HEUREUX ! </p>
<p>Au cours de nos pérégrinations professionnelles, nous avons souvent constater combien l'aidant était seul dans l'accompagnement de la personne âgée qu'il aime et soutient.</p>
<p>C'est pourquoi nous avons réfléchis à la création d'une structure d'accueil de courte durée pour personne âgée et/ou handicapée.</p>
<p>Afin de soulager les aidants et de répondre à leurs besoins, l'accueil se fera sur une durée de 4h, 8h, 24h, 5j ou 7j renouvelable trois fois (soit trois semaines consécutives).</p>
<p>La prise en charge sera effectuée par une aide-soignante pour 5 résidents épaulée par un animateur, dans un cadre idyllique au parc forestier du bois cassé, dans un site totalement clos avec vidéo-surveillance.</p>
<p>Auront lieu chaque jour de nombreuses animations, au gré des désirs des résidents. Il sera fait en moyenne deux fois par mois appel à une association d'artiste au chômage pour animer thé dansant, spectacle de magie ou encore pièce de théâtre. Un salon de coiffure, pédicure et esthétique sera à disposition des résidents, le but étant que chacun se sente comme chez soi tout en gardant une ouverture sur  le monde extérieur.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>YOUR HAPPY DAYS!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>During our professional wanderings we have frequently seen how the caregiver was alone in accompanying the elderly person he loves and supports.</p>
<p>That's why we think about creating a home for short-term elderly and / or disabled structure.</p>
<p>To relieve caregivers, and respond to their needs, Participants will be welcomed over a period of 4h, 8h, 24h, 5d and 7d renewable three times (three weeks).</p>
<p>Support shall be effected by a caregiver for 5 residents supported by a facilitator, in an idyllic setting in a forest park. A site completely enclosed with video surveillance.</p>
<p>Will take place every day, many events, according to the wishes of the residents. It will be done on average twice a month to call an association of artists to animate tea dance, magic show or play. A hairdresser, pedicure and beauty will be available to residents, with the aim that everyone feels at home while maintaining openness to the outside world.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>
<strong>Pourquoi ? / </strong>Why?</h2>
<p align=""center"">La place de la personne âgée, de la personne handicapée dans la société, le respect de sa dignité, de son intégrité, de son être même en tant que sujet, est l'affaire de tous :</p>
<p><strong>c'est en ce sens que nous proposons ce projet<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The place of the elderly, the place of disabled person in society, respect for their dignity, his integrity, his whole being as a subject, is everyone's business:</p>
<p><strong>It is in this sense that we propose this project</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2>
<strong>Comment vous nous aiderez / </strong>How you will help us</h2>
<p>Nous faisons appel à vos dons pour nous permettre de démarrer les travaux de mise aux normes de la structure afin de faire de ce lieu un espace convivial et respirant la joie.</p>
<p>La somme de 35000€ nous permettrait de faire débloquer le crédit de 450000€ demandé auprès des banques.</p>
<p><strong>Nous utiliserions celui-ci pour réaliser sur une surface de 2000m2 : </strong></p>
<p><strong>- 20 chambres d'une superficie de 22m2 avec salle de bain, </strong></p>
<p><strong>- un grand salon, </strong></p>
<p><strong>- une salle télévision, </strong></p>
<p><strong>- une salle de musique, </strong></p>
<p><strong>- plusieurs salles d'activités, </strong></p>
<p><strong>- le salon de coiffure/pédicure/esthétique</strong></p>
<p><strong>- une salle informatique équipée par nos soins</strong></p>
<p><strong>- une grande salle de festivité</strong></p>
<p><strong>- tout le mobilier et la décoration que nous souhaitons gaie et colorée</strong></p>
<p><strong>- une salle de repos pour le personnel</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ojectif atteind ou non le but reste le même !</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>We appeal to your donations to enable us to start work upgrading the structure in order to make this place a friendly and breathable joy.</p>
<p>The amount of € 35,000 would allow us to unlock the credit of € 450,000 requested from banks.</p>
<p><strong>We would use it to make an area of 2000m2:</strong></p>
<p><strong>- 20 rooms with a surface of 22m2 with bathroom,</strong></p>
<p><strong>- A large living room,</strong></p>
<p><strong>- A TV room,</strong></p>
<p><strong>- A music room,</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Several activity rooms,</strong></p>
<p><strong>- A hairdresser / pedicure / aesthetic</strong></p>
<p><strong>- A computer room equipped by our care</strong></p>
<p><strong>- A large living festivity</strong></p>
<p><strong>- All the furniture and decoration that we want cheerful and colorful</strong></p>
<p><strong>- A rest room for staff</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Reach the objective or not, the goal remains the same!</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>

Afin de soulager les aidants et de répondre à leurs besoins, l'accueil se fera sur une durée de 4h, 8h, 24h, 5j ou 7j renouvelable trois fois (soit trois semaines consécutives).
La prise en charge sera effectuée par une aide-soignante pour 5 résidents épaulée par un animateur, dans un cadre idyllique au parc forestier du bois cassé, dans un site totalement clos avec vidéo-surveillance.
Auront lieu chaque jour de nombreuses animations, au gré des désirs des résidents. Il sera fait en moyenne deux fois par mois appel à une association d'artiste au chômage pour animer thé dansant, spectacle de magie ou encore pièce de théâtre. Un salon de coiffure, pédicure et esthétique sera à disposition des résidents, le but étant que chacun se sente comme chez soi tout en gardant une ouverture sur  le monde extérieur.
 
YOUR HAPPY DAYS!
 
During our professional wanderings we have frequently seen how the caregiver was alone in accompanying the elderly person he loves and supports.
That's why we think about creating a home for short-term elderly and / or disabled structure.
To relieve caregivers, and respond to their needs, Participants will be welcomed over a period of 4h, 8h, 24h, 5d and 7d renewable three times (three weeks).
Support shall be effected by a caregiver for 5 residents supported by a facilitator, in an idyllic setting in a forest park. A site completely enclosed with video surveillance.
Will take place every day, many events, according to the wishes of the residents. It will be done on average twice a month to call an association of artists to animate tea dance, magic show or play. A hairdresser, pedicure and beauty will be available to residents, with the aim that everyone feels at home while maintaining openness to the outside world.
 

Pourquoi ? / Why?
La place de la personne âgée, de la personne handicapée dans la société, le respect de sa dignité, de son intégrité, de son être même en tant que sujet, est l'affaire de tous :
c'est en ce sens que nous proposons ce projet
 
The place of the elderly, the place of disabled person in society, respect for their dignity, his integrity, his whole being as a subject, is everyone's business:
It is in this sense that we propose this project
 

Comment vous nous aiderez / How you will help us
Nous faisons appel à vos dons pour nous permettre de démarrer les travaux de mise aux normes de la structure afin de faire de ce lieu un espace convivial et respirant la joie.
La somme de 35000€ nous permettrait de faire débloquer le crédit de 450000€ demandé auprès des banques.
Nous utiliserions celui-ci pour réaliser sur une surface de 2000m2 : 
- 20 chambres d'une superficie de 22m2 avec salle de bain, 
- un grand salon, 
- une salle télévision, 
- une salle de musique, 
- plusieurs salles d'activités, 
- le salon de coiffure/pédicure/esthétique
- une salle informatique équipée par nos soins
- une grande salle de festivité
- tout le mobilier et la décoration que nous souhaitons gaie et colorée
- une salle de repos pour le personnel
Ojectif atteind ou non le but reste le même !
 
 
We appeal to your donations to enable us to start work upgrading the structure in order to make this place a friendly and breathable joy.
The amount of € 35,000 would allow us to unlock the credit of € 450,000 requested from banks.
We would use it to make an area of 2000m2:
- 20 rooms with a surface of 22m2 with bathroom,
- A large living room,
- A TV room,
- A music room,
- Several activity rooms,
- A hairdresser / pedicure / aesthetic
- A computer room equipped by our care
- A large living festivity
- All the furniture and decoration that we want cheerful and colorful
- A rest room for staff
 
Reach the objective or not, the goal remains the same!

<p><br/>Thank you for taking the time to read my project, <br/>For 18 years, I was a smoker. Even after trying E-cigs for the first time 7 years ago, I was still smoking Analogs.

I am now at the point where I have flavors of my own creation that I vape more than any E-liquid that I buy!<br/><br/>Now to the idea/issue: I have been passing liquids to friends and whoever asks, and have repeatedly received feedback that I should try my hand at selling my E-liquid flavors. I have always laughed it off, until now. My wife and I are expecting a baby girl, and recently found out that, while on maternity leave, my wife will only receive 55% of her current pay.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As for what I need, I am looking for enough money to get my liquids online and in shops. I currently have around 12 flavors that are ready to go, and 15 more that I have been testing. What I am having a problem with follows:</p>
<p><br/>•	I have a website in process (Space and Domain is paid for  <a href=""http://www.thevapingdead.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.TheVapingDead.com</a>), but the cost of the Shopping Cart/Processor is out of my reach coming out of pocket (Paypal doesn't support Vaping)</p>

<p>•	I need help to finish the logo and labels for bottles<br/>•	I need to acquire a stock of enough raw materials to support selling to shops, as most local vapor stores do not pay up-front, and I cannot afford to make the supply they are looking for out of pocket.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This may not be seen as a true impact project; but through this whole process, I have helped many of my friends and acquaintances quit smoking.<br/>Vaping is a significantly better for your health, and the health of those around you, which makes for overall better quality of life.

 One of my very good friends, Danny Vanaphan, who also works with me at HBU MHW, and is also an AMAZING TRAINER (big shout outs, lol) has been bugging me to run in one of these with him for a long time. To tell you the truth, this has always been a goal of mine, but I've always been a lil scared to jump in head first. Well, as you can all tell, I've been thinking about James A LOT and how he has just managed to jump in and fight this cancer with a smile on his face, I'm sure he doesn't always FEEL like smiling, but...he doesn't let that stop him! So, what am I afraid of? His fight is so much harder, why am I being a WHIMP? I just signed up for the HALF MARATHON (BABY STEPS...) and I am running in honor of 4 people in my life...my brother, David, who is a throat cancer SURVIVOR, my mother in law, Ramona, who is a throat cancer SURVIVOR...they were both diagnosed and went through treatment around the same time....I just lost a friend, Keasha, to lung cancer last month...she was 38 and never smoked a day in her life....and then, there is JAMES DAY, 13 YEARS OLD, WHO IS CURRENTLY FIGHTNG AND WILL WIN HIS BATTLE AGAINST GERMINOMA! 
JAMES HAS PROVEN TO MANY THAT HE IS A FIGHTER AND HIS SMILE IS LIGHTING UP HIS FACEBOOK GROUP PAGE EVERY DAY! I LOVE THIS!!! I am not only going to be running for him but this fundraiser is dedicated to James and his family.

My Goal is to raise $10,000 before March 4 with all proceeds to got to Jamie, Val and James Day to help with there upcoming travels for radiation treaments...The radiation treatment that James needs is called PENCIL BEAM PROTON and is not available in Maine where James lives.  The family will have to travel in order to receive this treatment that will be so much more gentle on James' recovery process.  It is going to be a costly venture, but a much more gentle and positive treatment for James.  I am really excited James is a candidate for this treatment and want to help The Day Family make this treatment possible by helping them finacially...PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE if you are able to donate in ANY denomination it would be so greatly appreciated!  please visit James' facebook group page to read his postings and view many pictures!  <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/SHANNONEWESLEY#!/groups/218340254921411/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.facebook.com/SHANNONEWESLEY#!/groups...</a></div>","On March 4th there is an Amerian Cancer Society marathon and half marathon in New Orlans, LA...it's called THE ROCk AND ROLL!

Délai attendu pour des premiers résultats d’une année au minimum…Si rien n’est trouvé, la conclusion serait un ‘’accident’’ pendant la conception, les risques alors ‘’minimes’’ quant à avoir un autre enfant comme Julianne, mais rien pour nous rassurer et nous pousser dans cette voix là, vous l'imaginez !...Et pour finir, nous avons parlé du futur de Julianne, ce qui allait potentiellement lui arriver vu son état actuel. Il fallait s’y attendre, les nouvelles ne sont pas bonnes.Julianne a un déficit intellectuel lourd, et le gardera probablement toute sa vie. La marche est envisageable, il va falloir travailler dur, très dur, encore plus dur, mais ce n’est pas exclu. Le langage va par contre être très très compliqué, voir impossible. Tout est lié, le langage vient avec la compréhension… et Julianne est très en retard par rapport à la ‘’normalité’’. Nous devrons donc penser à terme à nous rapprocher de grands centres où tout est fait pour des enfants comme Julianne et là où une intention particulière est donnée aux enfants handicapés… Trouver d'autres moyens de communications, etc etc.Vous l’aurez compris, il m’a fallu quelques longues heures de réflexion avant d’écrire ce message et vous tenir informé.Vous l’aurez aussi compris, nous allons avoir besoin de toute l’aide possible dans toutes ces démarches, dures pour nous, dures pour Julianne et pour toute sa famille sur tous les plans…Donc, et si vous avez des idées pour nous aider à trouver des fonds pour payer toutes ces dépenses astronomiques (la seule journée passée à Necker pour effectuer les tests a coûté + de 1000 euros + les 3 billets d'avion + les dépenses sur place ++), si vous avez des contacts qui ont besoin de sites web, si vous connaissez des personnes qui seraient prêtes à parrainer Julianne financièrement, nous sommes à l’écoute de tout, de vous…Merci d’avance pour Julianne, notre petit ange de la différence, afin de lui permettre de vivre une vie, la plus normale possible !Benjamin, papa de Julianne",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Who am i and what the heck am i up to  now..??   </strong></p>
<p>I am a crisis mental health support worker, advocate for persons of varying abilities, aspiring herbalist and student of Plant Spirit Medicine. My deepest passion is to see balance restored to all beings through heart centred re-integration of humankind with the Divine Natural World.</p>
<p>Currently i am approaching the half way point in my training to become a Plant Spirit Medicine practitioner. (<a href=""http://www.plantspiritmedicine.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.plantspiritmedicine.org/</a>)</p>
<p>My teachers are Tsaurirrikame Eliot Cowan, (a fully intiated senior shaman in the Huichol tradition of Western Mexico,) and Granicera Alison Gayek (weather shaman in the Nahua tradition indigenous to Central Mexico)    </p>
<p><strong>How this medicine works...       </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>By blending eastern five element diagnostics and shamanism and differing from many other forms of herbalism in the importance placed on the personal relationships between plants, client and practitioner, this medicine is gentle but deeply effective.    Without treating symptoms and by looking at the whole person, the practitioner diagnosis the root of a persons' imbalance and identifies blocks to be cleared in much the same way an acupuncturist would. But instead of using needles the practioner calls upon Plant Spirits to do the work of clearing and rebalancing...'needleless needles'. The results are extraordinary. Deep and enduring healing is available for body, mind and spirit. </p>
<p>For many folks the thought of spirits even existing other than in the human context seems outrageous, but it really is a relatively new attitude. The ancients governed their lives according to the belief that ALL is Spirit-therefore sacred and powerful and to be treated as such. </p>
<p>In my experience over the years i have often felt helpless in the face of the pain and destruction i've witnessed in the lives of countless individuals as well as in my own life. To me it seems clear that we, as humans are desperately out of balance and as a result have brought ourselves and the rest of Earth's inhabitants into a very desperate state. Plant Spirits know this and are eagerly waiting to interact with us in a respectful, healing way to bring us back into right relationship with them and all other beings.</p>
<p>Funding for this training enables me to bring this potent medicine to my community where it is urgently needed. Upon graduation I intend to set up a healing practice in my home to begin with and eventually other places in the future. I also intend to offer workshops and spiritual spa days as a space to share indigenous teachings once i have completed my intiations.  and as with everything i do, i intend to make it accessible-working within folk's budgets. i continue to be open to trade and barter situations that honour both human parties as well as the medicine itself.</p>
<p><strong>What i need and where the funds will be going... </strong></p>
<p>i work full time to support a family of four. Situations being as they are right now leave little room for additional costs. All funds received from this campaign will go towards my tuition costs plus room and board and travel costs for the next bunch of months until i graduate (early 2013). Costs per week long stay is $1700US plus $200-$300US/CDN travel roundtrip. I have 5 more sessions to attend. I'm required to be on the land to study every 3 months or so.</p>

Tasia moved from St. George Utah to Salt Lake City late last year to pursue school and learning. On February 19, 2012 Tasia was traveling home with some friends when the car they were driving hit some black ice and rolled several times, ejecting Tasia and ending her short life all to soon.
What We Need & What You Get


Dennis and Teasa are not in agreat position to pay all the money for her funeral. Unfortunatley, they had to get multiple loans to pay for the sudden tragedy. They are now facing a hardship of trying to pay those bills and still supply for a family. They need your help.


The Impact
All of the $6200 (besides the Indiegogo fees) will be going to pay back the loans for this family. As well as ensure a future for their small family.

I’m an exercise scientist with a PhD in health statistics. I’ve been a coach all my life and a trainer for the Canadian Forces. I’ve helped about 10,000 people get in shape 1-on-1, in group classes, and online.</p><p>That’s how I found out that training is hard. It requires time, knowledge, and motivation. And just when you think you’re doing everything right, you can still get injured, get stuck, or lose motivation, and quit. And when you quit, you lose all your gains, and you and have to start all over again… And if that’s ever happened to you, you know how tough that is. Take it from me: I know.</p><p>In 2009, suddenly, I had trouble eating. I had no energy, couldn’t train, and felt my IQ had dropped 15 points. I used to get on the scale at least once a week to track my progress. But I stopped doing that: it was becoming too painful to see I was losing all the gains I’d worked so hard to make. Have a look:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542922637/gnplu7njqpiytwtcnwyx.png"" src=""""/></p><p>On this chart, on the left, you can see that in 2005, when I got on the scale for the first time, I weighed 143 lbs. In 2009, 4 years later, I had gained 18 lbs of muscle. I was proud of that!</p><p>But by 2010, I was down to 140 lbs—see that big dip on the right?</p><p>What happened is I had become intolerant to gluten. But doctors took 1 year to find out. So that year, I couldn't eat, couldn't train, and I ended up lighter than when I first started out.</p><h3>4 years of training: gone—just like that!</h3><p>By 2011, I had learned to manage gluten. I moved to London (England) for my PhD. And I started training with Dave Beattie.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542924806/cjhovr6wkaud75zmjent.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;margin:20px;""/>Dave was a 5-time world champion in powerlifting, and world-record holder in the squat. He had a really no-nonsense approach to training (that contrasted with my obsessive-compulsive style). We were training, and he would just say: do that. Do this. That was it. And...</p><h3>I gained back 21 lbs in 3 months</h3><p>Now granted, when you gain back muscle you’ve lost, it’s quicker. But still, in 3 months, I gained as much muscle as I had in 4 years.</p><p>When I started out, my mistake was that I desperately wanted to discover the best workout plan. I read tons of books to find the best exercises, how long to do them, how many times, how many times a week, and the perfect mix that would get me in great shape... in no time. So that I could get more attention and more respect! But that’s actually a mistake. And here’s why:</p><h3>Even the best workout is almost guaranteed to fail you... at some point</h3><p>While there may be a ""best"" workout plan for you now… That plan is almost guaranteed to stop working in the future. Because your body adapts. So if you keep on doing the same workout... even the BEST workout... you’ll start to notice you’re not improving as fast as you used to.</p><p>Plus, you just might get bored. And when you mix these 2 things, you’re setting yourself up to lose motivation, and quit. And if you're tough, and you really stick with it, you can end up overtrained, and injured. That’s what I was doing, and I was running around in circles with my training... wondering why the other guys were getting bigger, faster, and stronger, and I wasn't keeping up.</p><p>What I <strong>should </strong>have done, and what you <strong>should </strong>do, is to focus on a single fundamental training principle. Every good trainers knows this. My coach Dave in London knew it. In fact, it's exactly what the American College of Sports Medicine recommends (<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19204579"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ACSM, 2009</a>).</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542924505/ulkz6hwjp9cjzpnhj21w.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;margin:20px;""/></p><p>And that principle is <i>progressive overload</i>. Progressive overload just means that to get in better shape, you need to ""overload"" your workout…</p><p>But the way you ""overload"" has to be very specific: you must increase at least one of the major training variables of your workout <i>progressively... </i>So that you keep on challenging your body to transform.</p><p>Just by increasing the load, or repeating each exercise more times, you make your body think:</p><h3>""Oh dear! This is new, and unexpected—I need to improve!""</h3><p>And your body will improve and adapt by building muscle and burning fat. Over time, men usually end up quite muscular, and women, more sculpted; and both get leaner.</p><p>Plus, when you improve your fitness:</p><ul>
<li>Your improve your health</li>
<li>Your improve your looks</li>
<li>Your improve your energy</li>
<li>Your improve your strength</li>
<li>Your improve your muscle mass</li>
<li>Your improve your confidence</li>
<li>Your improve your mood</li>
</ul><h3><strong>You even improve your sex life!</strong></h3><p>You improve your self. I believe in self-improvement, and I really believe getting in shape is one of the best ways you can improve. It’s helped me tremendously.</p><p>But to make it work for you, your workout needs to start at your level, and improve with you. And the best way to ensure that, is to let a personal trainer guide you, motivate you, and update your plan in real time, as you do it. But trainers are expensive…</p><p>I know: I’ve been a trainer for 18 years. Here are just some of the men and women I've helped:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542954483/xxselpnfjqlrffhcjpjs.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542954524/ahaznmnmkvfuvspzpjez.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Now their results are not typical, and if you really want to get in shape, you'll need time, knowledge, and motivation. That’s why training is hard. And why so many people fail.</p><p>You know you’re failing when you’re training and you’re not improving… Or worse: you’ve given up. You’re not training. And now you’re out of shape:</p><h3>You have no stamina—you get out breath when you walk up stairs, and soon your clothes don’t fit</h3><p>Deep down, you’re not proud of yourself, and you know you gotta do something. <span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Just like a friend of mine. A few years ago, he started training with me an hour 3 days a week.</span></p><p>He’s a large dude, and in 2 months, he was lifting 300 lbs (that’s good by any standard). But then he had to skip a week because of work... then he got sick... one thing led to another, and he never came back. These days, he’s completely out of shape, and I really hate to see it.</p><p>I hate to see people fail at training. It's had such a big impact on my life, I’ve always wanted to help more people succeed at it, and change their life. But when I work as a personal trainer, I feel stuck, helping clients 1-on-1. Plus, it's just too expensive for most people. I had to find a better way.</p><p>So, in 2016, I finished my PhD, I gathered a small team, and we started building this new technology. Our vision was to give you the ability to improve almost as fast as if you had trainer, but for much cheaper.</p><p>With this technology, you apply all the latest science and the proven tricks of an experienced trainer automatically. Under the hood, your training is built around progressive overload (the fundamental principle we've just discussed). Your program updates in real time as you do it, so you always get in shape as fast as possible.</p><h3>Here's why you'll get in shape faster with Dr. Muscle...</h3><p><strong>It's more advanced</strong>. Your program:</p><ul>
<li>Starts at your level after a quick 1-time, 7-tap setup</li>
<li>Levels up with you, adding new exercises as you become more experienced, fitter, and stronger</li>
<li>Updates in real time as you work out with the best mix of reps, sets, and rest, so you always get in shape as fast as possible</li>
</ul><p><strong>Plus!</strong></p><p><strong>It's more fun.</strong> As one early access customer put it: <i>""It's like a surprise every workout"".</i></p><p><strong>It's easy and fast.</strong> Your workout is ready at the push of a button. You'll save time.</p><p><strong>You'll never lose your data. </strong>Your workout data is backed up safely in the cloud, so even if you lose your phone, you'll never lose your progress. Simply log in, and you can resume where you left off.</p><p>Exercise by exercise, workout by workout, Dr. Muscle can take you from the beginner stage to the advanced level. It automates almost everything, through the entire process. It guides you like a personal trainer, but it’s 10 times cheaper, always up to date, and available anytime, anywhere.</p><div><h3>Risks &amp; challenges</h3></div><div>
<p>We’ve been building this app for 2 years. To be honest, it wasn't easy. We started out with just 3 people, an idea, and little money. I wasn't sure the idea would stick. The main risk was spending all the money we could raise to build our prototype, just to see it fail.</p>
<p>But today, we’ve already fine tuned our prototype with data from 655 early access customers. We make enough money to keep the ball rolling, so we're here to stay. How much funding we get will influence how fast we implement our next features, so you don't risk backing this project and getting nothing in return. In fact, you'll get access to our prototype right away.</p>
<p>Building the right features is another challenge. My job is to make sure we build the features you want. My boss is you. To get your feedback, we've set up a special website. There, customers (like yourself?) get to suggest and vote for new features. We implement features with the most votes first, and we've already implemented 5 major features that way. So, we really value customer feedback. And when you become a customer, we will reach out and want to hear from you.</p>
</div><h3>You can do this!</h3><p>Training changed my life. I've seen it change the lives of hundreds of people. And it could change your life, too. By giving you strength, discipline, energy, and confidence. But it's hard. That's why we've made Dr. Muscle as easy to use as possible. It automates almost everything. It guides you in real time, and motivates you to get in shape. It's available anytime, anywhere. We're making training a rewarding experience, simple, and fun again. Come get in shape and improve with us. It could change your life.</p></div>","We’re turning to you to secure this round of funding, and your advice and feedback as we build and deliver the next key features of the app. To make sure we build the right features, we'll give you free access to our prototype as soon as you back this project (see perks descriptions on the right for details).

And this new technology may be the easiest and cheapest way to get there fast.""""Ever since I got hit by a car in college, I've looked for new and better ways to become healthy, lean, and fit. AI is the next frontier in fitness, and if you're doing any form of weight lifting, you should definitely check this new technology out.""""90% of people over the age of 35 lose enough muscle every year to burn off an additional 4 pounds of body fat. Don't let this happen to you. Lift weights. You'll look and feel years younger. And this new technology may be the easiest and cheapest way to get there fast.""-John Rowley, best-selling co-author of ""Old School New Body""""This app could get a whole lot of people on track integrating the modern science-based approach to building muscle mass and strength""""This new app looks like a winner. The app figures out sets, reps, volume, loading, and so forth, and does a damn good job of delivering a customized workout based on the individuals progress – or lack there of – using what’s called  “Daily Undulating Periodization” or DUP.""""Short of paying a good strength coach, this app could get a whole lot of people on track integrating the modern science-based approach to building muscle mass and strength while reducing the likelihood injuries and removing the guess work. So far, feedback from BrinkZone users of the app has been excellent.""-Will Brink, SWAT Trainer, Magazine Columnist (Over 50 mags in 9 countries), and author of Bodybuilding Revealed""Transform your body even if you can't afford a personal trainer""""In 2011, I became the WBFF Pro Bodybuilding World Champion. My secret? Dedication, motivation, and determination. You'll need all 3 to transform your body.""  ""What you'll also need is a sound training program. If you can afford it, a real, human personal trainer is the way to go. But this app may just be the next best thing.""  ""I've seen what it can do. It creates a customized workout program for you. Then, as you do it, it tells you exactly how much to lift, and how many reps and sets you should be doing. It's also surprisingly accurate. With this app, you can train smart and transform your body even if you can't afford a personal trainer. I think it has a lot of potential.""-Matt Stirling, Certified Personal Trainer, WBFF Bodybuilding World Champ, 2-Time Musclemania World Champion, and author of The Customized Carb Cycling Solution Customer reviews""I'm stronger at 58 than when I was 27!!"" -Silver Dakota, early access customer""I am a physical therapist that was unfortunately injured on a roller coaster. One cervical spinal fusion later I found myself much weaker than I thought I ever would be. I am happy to say that since using this app safely, and within my tolerance level, my strength (and arms) are coming back to pre-injury levels. I am so happy with my results!"" -Marie Francis, early access customer""This is whats been missing on the market. Wow! This app Knows exactly how to challenge you. I've gone from bench pressing 100 kg to 120 in just 3 months."" -Funkybizz, early access customer""Today my bud said that my arms are looking bigger than when he saw me three weeks ago. This means that Dr. Muscle is working as it is the only training resource that I’ve been using. With all the mess that I experienced earlier this year transitioning to a new health-club and adjusting to working out on my own I’m proud of myself for getting back into fitness and ditching expensive personal trainers with the help of this cool muscle building app."" -Remone Mundle, early access customer""Amazing, accurate, and logical to follow. Everything Dr. Juneau incorporates into his program is based on CURRENT scientific research and he doesn't deviate from that; ever, which I totally respect in this ""profit first"" culture we live in when he could be tempted to tell you B.S. just to get customers to spend more. I've taught science for 30 years and been a weight lifter for the majority of my life. This is easily, without exception, the best program and app available and it is literally customized to your own strength and experience. Seriously, ALL of the exercises, weights, sets, reps, on-the-spot self-evaluation, change in routine, time in between sets, and EVEN the gains you made both numeric and graphed are in this app. It's absolutely incredible and in my opinion revolutionary in the market. I wish I had this 40 years ago, but I don't think Dr. Muscle was around back then! Along with my gym membership, it's the best weight lifting money I've spent in my life and I give it my highest recommendation! Thanks Carl!!!"" -Jim Clift, early access customer A Personal Invitation From Dr. Carl JuneauIf you're looking to get in shape in 2019, then this may be the most important invitation you get this year.My name is Dr. Carl Juneau. I’m an exercise scientist with a PhD in health statistics. I’ve been a coach all my life and a trainer for the Canadian Forces. I’ve helped about 10,000 people get in shape 1-on-1, in group classes, and online.That’s how I found out that training is hard. It requires time, knowledge, and motivation. And just when you think you’re doing everything right, you can still get injured, get stuck, or lose motivation, and quit. And when you quit, you lose all your gains, and you and have to start all over again… And if that’s ever happened to you, you know how tough that is. Take it from me: I know.In 2009, suddenly, I had trouble eating. I had no energy, couldn’t train, and felt my IQ had dropped 15 points. I used to get on the scale at least once a week to track my progress. But I stopped doing that: it was becoming too painful to see I was losing all the gains I’d worked so hard to make. Have a look:On this chart, on the left, you can see that in 2005, when I got on the scale for the first time, I weighed 143 lbs. In 2009, 4 years later, I had gained 18 lbs of muscle. I was proud of that!But by 2010, I was down to 140 lbs—see that big dip on the right?What happened is I had become intolerant to gluten. But doctors took 1 year to find out. So that year, I couldn't eat, couldn't train, and I ended up lighter than when I first started out.4 years of training: gone—just like that!By 2011, I had learned to manage gluten. I moved to London (England) for my PhD. And I started training with Dave Beattie.Dave was a 5-time world champion in powerlifting, and world-record holder in the squat. He had a really no-nonsense approach to training (that contrasted with my obsessive-compulsive style). We were training, and he would just say: do that. Do this. That was it. And...I gained back 21 lbs in 3 monthsNow granted, when you gain back muscle you’ve lost, it’s quicker. But still, in 3 months, I gained as much muscle as I had in 4 years.When I started out, my mistake was that I desperately wanted to discover the best workout plan. I read tons of books to find the best exercises, how long to do them, how many times, how many times a week, and the perfect mix that would get me in great shape... in no time. So that I could get more attention and more respect! But that’s actually a mistake. And here’s why:Even the best workout is almost guaranteed to fail you... at some pointWhile there may be a ""best"" workout plan for you now… That plan is almost guaranteed to stop working in the future. Because your body adapts. So if you keep on doing the same workout... even the BEST workout... you’ll start to notice you’re not improving as fast as you used to.Plus, you just might get bored. And when you mix these 2 things, you’re setting yourself up to lose motivation, and quit. And if you're tough, and you really stick with it, you can end up overtrained, and injured. That’s what I was doing, and I was running around in circles with my training... wondering why the other guys were getting bigger, faster, and stronger, and I wasn't keeping up.What I should have done, and what you should do, is to focus on a single fundamental training principle. Every good trainers knows this. My coach Dave in London knew it. In fact, it's exactly what the American College of Sports Medicine recommends (ACSM, 2009).And that principle is progressive overload. Progressive overload just means that to get in better shape, you need to ""overload"" your workout…But the way you ""overload"" has to be very specific: you must increase at least one of the major training variables of your workout progressively... So that you keep on challenging your body to transform.Just by increasing the load, or repeating each exercise more times, you make your body think:""Oh dear! This is new, and unexpected—I need to improve!""And your body will improve and adapt by building muscle and burning fat. Over time, men usually end up quite muscular, and women, more sculpted; and both get leaner.Plus, when you improve your fitness:
Your improve your health
Your improve your looks
Your improve your energy
Your improve your strength
Your improve your muscle mass
Your improve your confidence
Your improve your mood
You even improve your sex life!You improve your self. I believe in self-improvement, and I really believe getting in shape is one of the best ways you can improve. It’s helped me tremendously.But to make it work for you, your workout needs to start at your level, and improve with you. And the best way to ensure that, is to let a personal trainer guide you, motivate you, and update your plan in real time, as you do it. But trainers are expensive…I know: I’ve been a trainer for 18 years. Here are just some of the men and women I've helped:Now their results are not typical, and if you really want to get in shape, you'll need time, knowledge, and motivation. That’s why training is hard. And why so many people fail.You know you’re failing when you’re training and you’re not improving… Or worse: you’ve given up. You’re not training. And now you’re out of shape:You have no stamina—you get out breath when you walk up stairs, and soon your clothes don’t fitDeep down, you’re not proud of yourself, and you know you gotta do something. Just like a friend of mine. A few years ago, he started training with me an hour 3 days a week.He’s a large dude, and in 2 months, he was lifting 300 lbs (that’s good by any standard). But then he had to skip a week because of work... then he got sick... one thing led to another, and he never came back. These days, he’s completely out of shape, and I really hate to see it.I hate to see people fail at training. It's had such a big impact on my life, I’ve always wanted to help more people succeed at it, and change their life. But when I work as a personal trainer, I feel stuck, helping clients 1-on-1. Plus, it's just too expensive for most people. I had to find a better way.So, in 2016, I finished my PhD, I gathered a small team, and we started building this new technology. Our vision was to give you the ability to improve almost as fast as if you had trainer, but for much cheaper.With this technology, you apply all the latest science and the proven tricks of an experienced trainer automatically. Under the hood, your training is built around progressive overload (the fundamental principle we've just discussed). Your program updates in real time as you do it, so you always get in shape as fast as possible.Here's why you'll get in shape faster with Dr. Muscle...It's more advanced. Your program:
Starts at your level after a quick 1-time, 7-tap setup
Levels up with you, adding new exercises as you become more experienced, fitter, and stronger
Updates in real time as you work out with the best mix of reps, sets, and rest, so you always get in shape as fast as possible
Plus!It's more fun. As one early access customer put it: ""It's like a surprise every workout"".It's easy and fast. Your workout is ready at the push of a button. You'll save time.You'll never lose your data. Your workout data is backed up safely in the cloud, so even if you lose your phone, you'll never lose your progress. Simply log in, and you can resume where you left off.Exercise by exercise, workout by workout, Dr. Muscle can take you from the beginner stage to the advanced level. It automates almost everything, through the entire process. It guides you like a personal trainer, but it’s 10 times cheaper, always up to date, and available anytime, anywhere.Risks & challenges
We’ve been building this app for 2 years. To be honest, it wasn't easy. We started out with just 3 people, an idea, and little money. I wasn't sure the idea would stick. The main risk was spending all the money we could raise to build our prototype, just to see it fail.
But today, we’ve already fine tuned our prototype with data from 655 early access customers. We make enough money to keep the ball rolling, so we're here to stay. How much funding we get will influence how fast we implement our next features, so you don't risk backing this project and getting nothing in return. In fact, you'll get access to our prototype right away.
Building the right features is another challenge. My job is to make sure we build the features you want. My boss is you. To get your feedback, we've set up a special website. There, customers (like yourself?) get to suggest and vote for new features. We implement features with the most votes first, and we've already implemented 5 major features that way. So, we really value customer feedback. And when you become a customer, we will reach out and want to hear from you.
You can do this!Training changed my life. I've seen it change the lives of hundreds of people. And it could change your life, too. By giving you strength, discipline, energy, and confidence. But it's hard. That's why we've made Dr. Muscle as easy to use as possible. It automates almost everything. It guides you in real time, and motivates you to get in shape. It's available anytime, anywhere. We're making training a rewarding experience, simple, and fun again. Come get in shape and improve with us. It could change your life.",34.0,2,"2 Campaigns

<p>For this year 2012, we would sincerely like to invite you and your organization to be part of the following project of Creating an Organic Garden to supply organic food to our school kitchens of Pachar and Rumira which is desperately needed for the severely deprived students of the Sacred Valley, Cusco.</p>
<p><strong>The need for creating an Organic Garden:</strong></p>
<p>Nowadays, markets are filled with food produced with chemicals such as strong insecticides, hormones and genetically modified seeds, hence we would like to produce and grow our food organically, reviving and preserving ancient knowledge of nature.</p>
<p>Our garden will use natural fertilizers such as manure from animals, especially from Cuy (Guinea Pigs), as well as natural insecticides such as plant extracts.</p>
<p>Here, we will facilitate workshops to teach the effective ancient techniques of organic food production. The workshops will emphasize the protection of Pachamama (Mother Earth) and the reforestation of indigenous plants for native animal shelter.</p>
<p>In this garden we will plant medicine herbs, so the teacher of Rumira who is a medicine man who studied natural medicine can teach the children how to make natural medicine from local plants.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>NOW is a pivital moment in Ghana</h3>
<p>We are there at the invitation of <a href=""http://africaictright.blogspot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Africa ICT Right</a> to establish a relationship with the Ghanan government for Free Software in education. This Fall 2012 project marks the first visit to Ghana with the intention of returning every 6 months to deploy 100 more desktops and visit our deployments.

<p><br/>Additionally,<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghanaian_presidential_election,_2012"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Ghana is in the myst of a Presidential election</a>. Therefore, it is critical that now Free Software gets highly visible positive exposure in Ghana, specifically, the sites that we will visit in the capital of <a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/bethlynnandcomputereach/home/where"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Accra and the villages of Gama East, West Gonja, and Ho.</a></p>
<h3>My Role with Free Software and <a href=""http://www.computereach.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Computer Reach</a> </h3>
<p>I am working uncompensated full-time for the 501c3 non-profit Computer Reach as the ""FREE Software Director."" This role joins my interest resolving the digital divide and recycling with my experience in the Free Software Desktop. I am well qualified to deploy 100 desktops in Ghana Africa this Fall because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over 13 years of professional experience in working with GNU/Linux desktops with Pittsburgh Supercomputing, Carnegie Mellon University, TimeSys Corporation, Bettis Laboratory, and Wellspring Worldwide.</li>
<li>I was the engineering architect behind Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science's first Red Hat Linux computer lab.</li>
<li>Through my leadership in Western PA Linux User Group since 2010, I mentored Computer Reach's Executive Director, Dave Sevick, through the process of adding Edubuntu and Free Software offerings for Apple desktops.</li>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Even though this is a full time effort for me, Computer Reach does not have the funding to give me a salary or to reimburse all of my expenses. With the full cost of $250 for each computer, Computer Reach has wisely decided to put as much as their funds as possible into physical resources.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Every time I encounter an expense, <a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/bethlynnandcomputereach/home/expenses?pli=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">I document it on my notebook.</a>
</li>
<li>Travel to an African nation for a US citizen means Visa expenses and immunization.</li>
<li>The flight to Accra, Ghana cost $1500 alone and that is at a price that is hard to beat.</li>
<li>If I don't reach my goal of $3000, my personal savings will be drained. This comes at a time which <strong>I do not have any other income or a ""day job"" to resume after the mission.</strong>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Funding me generously means that I will proceed with confidence. Every six months, I will return to Ghana. Each time I will recruit, train, and manage yet another team of competent professionals in IT, education, and project management to deploy 100 more desktops.</p>
<p>Even though we are deploying 100 desktops, 1000s of lives will be touched as this is the only source of technology for their children and their families.</p>
<p>By using Free Software, we save money for Computer Reach and the program recipients by using non-proprietary software. This insures no surprise</p>

<p>Hello Indiegogo Folks, Buenos Dias, Bonjour, and welcome all to <strong>Angry Clubs !</strong></p>
<h1><strong>Who are we ?</strong></h1>
<p>Like the 3 Musketeers, The Angry Clubs team is comprised of four individuals, but contrary to our French forefathers, we all from different countries: 2 Hispanic Americans, 1 French American and 1 Franco-British American (that would be me), hence the greetings.</p>
<p>We come from all walks of life, but have one thing in common...our love of Golf. We don’t play Golf…we are Golfers, and as you may not know, there is a huge difference between both.</p>
<h1>Our Idea :</h1>
<p>6 months ago I was having a business lunch with one of my (future partners), when during the conversation I “jokingly” threw at him, that I had an idea for a golf gadget, which I thought every relative or friend would love to offer their golfing relatives or friends.</p>
<p>A week later we were on the drawing board to see how we could move my (theoretical) idea to a practical one.</p>
<p>Did you know that last year golfers spent over $72 billion (yes that’s right, 9 zeros) on golf-related products.</p>
<p>There are unfortunately no statistics telling us how much of that money was spent by golfers who had to replace clubs they had broken or thrown into different hazards.</p>
<p>But from my (first-hand) experience, it has got to be several $millions.</p>
<p>Have I ever broken a $300 dollar driver out of pure disgust after a G**awful drive……Youbetcha! Once or twice…</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/196/722/8acf02e739796d92b3f49cc0e19dc6ff_large.jpg?1349672905"" src="""" style=""""/></div>

<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/195/844/0611de5a93cbf79b9db8a8dd71ba830f_large.png?1349597868"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
</div>
<div class=""full-description"">And seeing my friends and so many golfers doing the same thing (and sometimes way worse) got me thinking.
<p>There had to be a better, cheaper and why not funnier solution to breaking or throwing hundreds of dollars of equipment in the Golf courses woods or lakes.</p>
<p>So why not invent a Gadget which would allow us poor masochists (you have to be to play golf seriously) to vent all that anger and frustration we feel, without it not only costing us an arm and leg, but also getting a good laughout of all parties present ?</p>
<p>For example, If you go onto youtube and type in “golf clubs thrown into lakes”, you will be surprised to see that, when a golfer throws or breaks his club, it invariably generates hilarious laughter from his playing partners.</p>
<p>Angry Clubs should also make the “culprit” laugh too! And that’s no mean feat! After all let’s face it, all we are trying to do is hit a small ball into a small hole with a stick ! How complicated can that be?   </p>
<h1><strong>From Theory to Reality :</strong></h1>
<p>So any way we started brainstorming to see how we create an Angry Clubs (I had already trademarked the name and reserved the domain name) which would not only be a fun gadget, but would also be useful and above all, affordable enough to warrant the interest  of hundreds of millions of potential customers.</p>
<p>That is when I realized that like a puzzle, all the pieces were there, we just had to place them in their right spots.</p>
<p>We made our first prototype, for which we filed a utility patent 2 months ago, and this is the result:</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/195/836/a71fc3918e18f48410c4a26426a45520_large.jpg?1349597473"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>We have in the meantime made small alterations to make both the Angry Clubs itself as well as the Angry Clubs Putter Grip (a version of the Angry Club that can be adapted to any putter) even better, but the main concept remains the same. <br/><br/>We then decided it was time to show our prototype to a design specialist so that he might optimize the Angry Clubs and putter grip, making it amongst other things slimmer and better looking.<br/><br/>We knew that we had a great name trademarked, but needed to have a great logo created, so gave it to one of our graphic designer friends, who did what I think is, a great job.</p>
<p>Here is the result and this is what the first Angry Clubs will look like when they will reach the market in March 2013 :</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/188/775/fef76d6c2b1dfdcaf33761ab2b6e2817_large.jpg?1349204910"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<h1>
<strong>Our Target Market</strong> :</h1>
<p>You will probably think I am as mad as a hatter, if I told you it’s not really the golfers themselves.</p>
<p>It’s mostly true, because I would not necessarily buy it for myself, but I would buy one for my dear friend Sam, who lives in Rhode Island (Yup Sam, I already have one of the first ones reserved for you) , and I can guarantee you that my wife or my daughter would buy one for me (if I weren’t the inventor of the Angry Clubs of course).</p>
<p>You don’t believe me?</p>
<p>All you need to do is find a golfer friend, and ask any of their relatives (especially his wife or her husband) if they don’t think that this would be perfect gift for Father’s/Mother’s day, birthday or Christmas present?</p>
<p>Don’t forget to mention that The Angry Clubs should retail for less than $50 compared to the average ordinary Swing trainer which costs $70-$120.</p>
<h1><strong>Our “Problem” :</strong></h1>
<ul>
<li>How do we get our first batch of Angry Clubs manufactured ?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>How do we get the message out to the probably over ½ billion relatives and friends of the 60 million golfers in the world?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>How do we communicate with the 17,000 Golf club presidents in the US alone, who organize over 400,000 tournaments a year ?</li>
</ul>
<h1>
<strong>Our “Solution”</strong> :</h1>
<p>HELLO Indiegogo community...that’s where (we hope) you come in!</p>
<p>You can help us make it happen!</p>
<p>You have done it before many times, and we hope that our enthusiasm and passion for our project will entice you to do it again, for and with us.</p>
<p>We already have secured 3 potential manufacturers and shown them our current working prototype, explained them the technology we want to use as well as the final design that we want for the product.</p>
<p>If we are fortunate enough to receive your support, the promise I will make to you, is that every cent of your funds will go into ordering a first batch of 5000 Angry Clubs, which will be presented and introduced to the Market at the PGA Merchandise Show at Orlando (we already have reserved the booth), January 2013.</p>
<p>29 million golfers in the US is great, but there are as many in the rest of the world, so why not cater to their needs too? We will be presenting the Angry Clubs at the Rhein Golf Messe in Koeln, Germany beginning of March and at the China Golf Show in Beijing end of March 2013.</p>
<p>USA, Europe and Asia, all our bases are covered.</p>
<p>All I need now is “a little help from my friends” as John and Paul would say (I hope you are a Beatles fan, otherwise I might have lost you on that one)</p>
<p>That having been said, I wanted to tell you all, that whatever your eventual pledge (or non pledge) <strong>there is one thing you have already given us : </strong></p>
<p><strong>A dream</strong>…and that’s already pretty cool !</p>
<p>So for that, and the rest... <strong>thank you !</strong><br/><br/>Patrick<br/>ANGRY CLUBS<br/> <br/>N.B : Please note that due to patent applications and  proprietary technology reasons, we have not illustrated some unique components pertaining to our Angry Clubs.

There had to be a better, cheaper and why not funnier solution to breaking or throwing hundreds of dollars of equipment in the Golf courses woods or lakes.
So why not invent a Gadget which would allow us poor masochists (you have to be to play golf seriously) to vent all that anger and frustration we feel, without it not only costing us an arm and leg, but also getting a good laughout of all parties present ?
For example, If you go onto youtube and type in “golf clubs thrown into lakes”, you will be surprised to see that, when a golfer throws or breaks his club, it invariably generates hilarious laughter from his playing partners.
Angry Clubs should also make the “culprit” laugh too! And that’s no mean feat! After all let’s face it, all we are trying to do is hit a small ball into a small hole with a stick ! How complicated can that be?   
From Theory to Reality :
So any way we started brainstorming to see how we create an Angry Clubs (I had already trademarked the name and reserved the domain name) which would not only be a fun gadget, but would also be useful and above all, affordable enough to warrant the interest  of hundreds of millions of potential customers.
That is when I realized that like a puzzle, all the pieces were there, we just had to place them in their right spots.
We made our first prototype, for which we filed a utility patent 2 months ago, and this is the result:

We have in the meantime made small alterations to make both the Angry Clubs itself as well as the Angry Clubs Putter Grip (a version of the Angry Club that can be adapted to any putter) even better, but the main concept remains the same. We then decided it was time to show our prototype to a design specialist so that he might optimize the Angry Clubs and putter grip, making it amongst other things slimmer and better looking.We knew that we had a great name trademarked, but needed to have a great logo created, so gave it to one of our graphic designer friends, who did what I think is, a great job.
Here is the result and this is what the first Angry Clubs will look like when they will reach the market in March 2013 :


Our Target Market :
You will probably think I am as mad as a hatter, if I told you it’s not really the golfers themselves.
It’s mostly true, because I would not necessarily buy it for myself, but I would buy one for my dear friend Sam, who lives in Rhode Island (Yup Sam, I already have one of the first ones reserved for you) , and I can guarantee you that my wife or my daughter would buy one for me (if I weren’t the inventor of the Angry Clubs of course).
You don’t believe me?
All you need to do is find a golfer friend, and ask any of their relatives (especially his wife or her husband) if they don’t think that this would be perfect gift for Father’s/Mother’s day, birthday or Christmas present?
Don’t forget to mention that The Angry Clubs should retail for less than $50 compared to the average ordinary Swing trainer which costs $70-$120.
Our “Problem” :

How do we get our first batch of Angry Clubs manufactured ?


How do we get the message out to the probably over ½ billion relatives and friends of the 60 million golfers in the world?


How do we communicate with the 17,000 Golf club presidents in the US alone, who organize over 400,000 tournaments a year ?


Our “Solution” :
HELLO Indiegogo community...that’s where (we hope) you come in!
You can help us make it happen!
You have done it before many times, and we hope that our enthusiasm and passion for our project will entice you to do it again, for and with us.
We already have secured 3 potential manufacturers and shown them our current working prototype, explained them the technology we want to use as well as the final design that we want for the product.
If we are fortunate enough to receive your support, the promise I will make to you, is that every cent of your funds will go into ordering a first batch of 5000 Angry Clubs, which will be presented and introduced to the Market at the PGA Merchandise Show at Orlando (we already have reserved the booth), January 2013.
29 million golfers in the US is great, but there are as many in the rest of the world, so why not cater to their needs too? We will be presenting the Angry Clubs at the Rhein Golf Messe in Koeln, Germany beginning of March and at the China Golf Show in Beijing end of March 2013.
USA, Europe and Asia, all our bases are covered.
All I need now is “a little help from my friends” as John and Paul would say (I hope you are a Beatles fan, otherwise I might have lost you on that one)
That having been said, I wanted to tell you all, that whatever your eventual pledge (or non pledge) there is one thing you have already given us : 
A dream…and that’s already pretty cool !
So for that, and the rest... thank you !PatrickANGRY CLUBS N.B : Please note that due to patent applications and  proprietary technology reasons, we have not illustrated some unique components pertaining to our Angry Clubs. The Angry Clubs is now trademarked and has a website under construction http://www.angryclubs.com. Utility patents have been filed for both the Angry Clubs and the Angry Clubs Putter Grip.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Elijah Harter and I am a husband and father of three children. I volunteered in my community to help coach baseball, soccer, and football. Since my diagnosis I am unable to continue this time commitment. My wife Amy and I have been together for almost twenty years. My son Tony ""Tee"" plays football, basketball, and soccer. My daughter Sarah nicknamed ""Sarge"" loves soccer and is her teams goalie, she is also part of the art and science clubs at her middle school. My youngest son William can only be described as a young MegaMind from the movie. He is a smart seven year old that hopefully will use his powers for good.</p>
<p>I am able to still work and run a retail store for the outdoor company The North Face. This is a great company that follows my sustainability beliefs and looks to help preserve our outdoor playgrounds. That brings me to my hobbies. I really enjoy the outdoors. I love to hike and do moderate bouldering. Unfortunately my cancer Islocated in my entire sternum and it makes it difficult for me to breath. It also has created an irregular shaped sternum that causes me daily pain. So now I tackle smaller trails but still try to push my limits.</p>
<p>My most recent favorite experience was to visit the Big Basin Redwoods State Park. Here we were with our fellow peers from The North Face. We bonded and mountain biked up one of the mountains. I lost my breath several times and I was about to turn back. My good friend Brett came down the mountain about fifty feet and didn't say a word. He just grabed the bike with me holding on and walked me that last fifty feet to the top of the trail. I was so out of breath all I could do was tear up. I made it. The ride down was breathtaking.</p>
<p>I also love to camp and fish. Minnesota is a great area for both. I will continue to enjoy as much of the outdoors as possible. Having just come back from a family trip to the Black Hills I want to enjoy as much of my life that I can with my family and friends. I am optimistic that I will make the most of my time.</p>
<p>This campaign is important to me because it will help me cover my additional medical bills and hopefully make it so I can still travel with my family and enjoy the little things in life. I can not thank you for your support enough. You will help my children create life long memories with their father.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My medical bills are mainly for all the tests that I need to go through. They are looking to see where my bone marrow is developing holes. This requires several bone marrow biopsies about every six months. I also have skeletal surveys, cat scans, and MRI's. My least favorite is the MRI's. The clostraphobia is difficult.</p>
<p>I have medical insurance with The North Face and it does cover the majority of each procedure but we still need to cover 20% of each bill. The medical bills continue to get higher and will continue for the rest of my life. Each of the funds will go to cover our medical expenses and any related expenses on our credit card..</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We are also planning different garage sales to help raise money. Any contributions of items to these sales would also be helpful.</p>
<p>Also moral support is encouraged. I am a strong believer that the only way to battle cancer is to be open about it and take as much advice as possible.</p>

</div>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span>Some people know it as a “sensory deprivation tank”, but that’s a misnomer, because you aren’t really “depriving” your body. You are actually placing your body in a neutral environment where your senses are heightened.</span></p>
<p>A Floatation Tank is a sound and lightproof spa in which you float effortlessly, like a cork, on the surface of 10 inches of water that is super-saturated with 800 pounds of medical grade Epsom salt. The solution is heated to the exact temperature of your skin (93.5°F), allowing your body to be perfectly supported by a cushion of silky skin-temperature liquid.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434139169/jzof41g5znqfkbovnjs5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Relaxing in a floatation tank is the closest thing to feeling the weightlessness of outerspace, here on earth. It allows the user an experience of deep relaxation in an almost weightless environment, giving the body a chance to heal itself and allowing the mind to drift into the deepest state of relaxation possible.</span><br/></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Experience</h3> <p></p>
</div><p><span>Floatation tanks are some of the few places on earth where you can experience your body free from the forces of gravity.</span></p><p>The temperature of the water means that once you are settled in the tank, it is virtually impossible to distinguish between parts of the body that are in contact with the water and those parts which are floating above the water. The effect is that it “fools” the brain into believing that you are floating in mid-air.</p><p>Every single muscle in the body is allowed to totally relax, and your brain falls into the theta wave state -- the most relaxed you can get without being asleep. With the tank’s interior lights off, the quietness and the darkness allow the mind to drift into a deep state of relaxation.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432370877/kbl2hker7gmjoanaka3l.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 409.917355371901px; height: 240px;""/></p><br/><div><h3><span>The Plan...</span></h3></div><div><span><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Funding will go towards the creation of an oasis in an urban center that is both beautiful and comfortable that needs to be sound-proof, light-proof and well-ventilated.

<h3>The Effects of Floating...</h3> <p></p>
<p><span><b>Unparalleled Mental Calm</b></span></p>
<p>You may have tried other methods relaxation or meditation -- but until you've tried floating, you're missing out on an incredible experience.</p>
<p>A float tank creates a weightless environment in which the body is completely supported, external stimuli is reduced, and there is nothing left for the brain to do. As such, the logical side of the brain is rendered redundant and its activity slows down until it reaches a theta level. Although the user is technically awake, they will enter a “dream-like” state in which the brain begins releasing endorphins and stress hormones, like cortisol, will drop.</p>

<p><b>Physical Relief </b></p>
<p>Flotation therapy is a wonderful way to assist the body in healing itself.</p>
<p>The environment inside the tank allows the body to work unencumbered, bringing itself back to optimum health more effectively and efficiently than any other form of rest. The weightless environment allows your spine and muscles to stretch out and realign themselves, while the epsom salt pull toxins and lactic acids from your body, aiding in the recovery process and lifting your mood.</p>

</div></div>","Help Mission Yoga be able to offer a truly transformative, relaxing and healing experience: A Premier Samadhi Floatation Center! This urban oasis will be the only one of its kind in San Francisco’s busy Mission District. 
Thank
you for checking out our Indiegogo page! Help us fulfill our dream of making Mission
Yoga a truly transformative experience by adding a floatation center. We
believe floating, combined with Bikram Yoga and our in-house massage, will provide
San Francisco’s Mission District a much-needed wellness oasis within our
bustling neighborhood.



We've been floating for years, and we’re eager to share the benefits with the
community. Our plan is to build the floatation center in an unused room in the
studio that will not only create bliss for you, but provide us an additional revenue
stream that will allow us to stay in the heart of one of America’s most
expensive cities. We’ve been in San Francisco’s Mission District since 2001,
and we want to stay! 

Floating is the most powerful tool for human growth and well-being since yoga. Benefits include: 






Reduction of Chronic Pain


Decrease in Stress


Strengthening of Immune System


Promoting Creative Thinking


Enhancing Learning


Calming Mind and Body


Speeding of Healing and Physical Recovery


Lowering of Blood Pressure


Jet lag and Fatigue Recovery


Aid in the Elimination of Addictions (Smoking, Alcohol Intake and Weight Loss)(Scroll down the page for more specifics on the benefits.)







What is a Floatation Tank?


Some people know it as a “sensory deprivation tank”, but that’s a misnomer, because you aren’t really “depriving” your body. You are actually placing your body in a neutral environment where your senses are heightened.
A Floatation Tank is a sound and lightproof spa in which you float effortlessly, like a cork, on the surface of 10 inches of water that is super-saturated with 800 pounds of medical grade Epsom salt. The solution is heated to the exact temperature of your skin (93.5°F), allowing your body to be perfectly supported by a cushion of silky skin-temperature liquid.





Relaxing in a floatation tank is the closest thing to feeling the weightlessness of outerspace, here on earth. It allows the user an experience of deep relaxation in an almost weightless environment, giving the body a chance to heal itself and allowing the mind to drift into the deepest state of relaxation possible.
   
The Experience 
Floatation tanks are some of the few places on earth where you can experience your body free from the forces of gravity.The temperature of the water means that once you are settled in the tank, it is virtually impossible to distinguish between parts of the body that are in contact with the water and those parts which are floating above the water. The effect is that it “fools” the brain into believing that you are floating in mid-air.Every single muscle in the body is allowed to totally relax, and your brain falls into the theta wave state -- the most relaxed you can get without being asleep. With the tank’s interior lights off, the quietness and the darkness allow the mind to drift into a deep state of relaxation.The Plan...Funding will go towards the creation of an oasis in an urban center that is both beautiful and comfortable that needs to be sound-proof, light-proof and well-ventilated. The installation of the tank will require plumbing and electrical plus waterproofing and salt-proofing. Finally, we will need to procure salt for the tank.The good news is we already own one tank and have access to another. We plan to install the tank in our existing yoga business with no interruption to our class schedule.Swag, Yoga, and Massage will be available as soon as we hit our goals, the Floats will be available as soon as we complete the Float Center. (Scroll down for more details!) Our goal is to have the float center up and running by the end of the summer and our Indiegogo contributors will be among the first people to float.


About Us...
We are Steve23 and Juicy Liberty Sanchez of Mission Yoga. Together we have over 30 years in business. We're joining forces with  Shoshana Leibner of Float Dreams to create Mission Float, San Francisco's premier Samadhi tank float center located in the Heart of San Francisco’s Mission District.


The Effects of Floating... 
Unparalleled Mental Calm
You may have tried other methods relaxation or meditation -- but until you've tried floating, you're missing out on an incredible experience.
A float tank creates a weightless environment in which the body is completely supported, external stimuli is reduced, and there is nothing left for the brain to do. As such, the logical side of the brain is rendered redundant and its activity slows down until it reaches a theta level. Although the user is technically awake, they will enter a “dream-like” state in which the brain begins releasing endorphins and stress hormones, like cortisol, will drop.


For many people, floating is the only way to achieve a deep level of relaxation and calm.
Physical Relief 
Flotation therapy is a wonderful way to assist the body in healing itself.
The environment inside the tank allows the body to work unencumbered, bringing itself back to optimum health more effectively and efficiently than any other form of rest. The weightless environment allows your spine and muscles to stretch out and realign themselves, while the epsom salt pull toxins and lactic acids from your body, aiding in the recovery process and lifting your mood.


Flotation therapy has numerous physical benefits:

A refuge from chronic pain such as fibromyalgia, arthritis, and back injuries
Enhances athletic performance & sports rehabilitation
Speeds the healing process
Decreases the production of Cortisol, ACTH, Lactic Acid and Adrenaline
Improves circulation and distribution of oxygen and nutrients

All parents know what it’s like taking children to parks, malls and amusement parks. With all the people around, sometimes it’s quite nerve-racking trying to keep an eye on your children while they’re running about. You don’t want to be overprotective, but there’s always the chance that you might lose sight of them.BeLuvv, a Taiwanese start up company has come up with an answer to this problem: ""Guardian"", a wearable devices that can help parents locate their kids if they wander off, and aid in the location of children before they go missing permanently.




As seen on





Kids wear it
Guardian is a tiny Bluetooth piece that can be inserted into a bracelet. Its minimalist design fits right in with the fashion of the day. Besides, the bracelet are made of natural silicone that are comfortable and so easily to slip on. Your kids will love wearing them everyday!


Parents download it 


Guardian is an accessory that interacts with an App on your phone. As long as your kids are wearing the device, you can see their exact whereabouts on your smartphones through the Guardian App.The app alerts you if your child wanders out of the perimeter you set. Parents can also add trusted ones, such as neighbors, teachers, nannies and relatives, to their group as co-guardians, so that more people can help keep an eye on the little ones.

  

    


Guardian network
The Guardian app is free. The more people who install it, the more watertight the network becomes. Here's why: If a child is found missing, parents can immediately launch a global search. When the child in question passes by a person using Guardian app, the cloud system immediately sends the location to the parents. The user may accidentally save s child's life. 




Your privacy is ensured

Parents may have a privacy concern :""How to avoid someone dangerous downloading the app and locating lost kids?"" BeLuvv takes the safety of your loved ones very seriously. When the lost child passes by a user of the Guardian app, only the parents of the lost child and anyone else the parents chose to include as co-guardians are notified. The user does not know about it. 



Features






Be a hero, bring them home.








There are 8,000,000 instances of missing children all around the world each year. According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, roughly 800,000 children are reported missing each year in the United States -- that's roughly 2,000 per day. It is notable that 76.2 percent of abducted children who are killed are dead within three hours of the abduction. The first three hours are the most critical when trying to locate a missing child. If we could successfully locate the missing child before the end of the 72 hours ""golden window"", tragedy would not have happened. Even more, if the child did not go missing, there would be no sad story. Every child around the world needs your help.

 


The campaign is raising children safety awareness and funds on behalf of BeLuvv, a startup company who launched Guardian recently. BeLuvv pledges to donate 1 unit for every 2 sold. When our customers buy two BeLuvv products, we will donate one to those in need. Your support can more than protect your kids but others.

<b>Production Status</b><br/>Thank you so much to all of our campaign backers - because of your support we are kicking off production.</div><div> </div><div>Our campaign is now closed but watch for news of our live launch later this year.</div><div> </div><div>_____________________________________________________________________</div><p> </p><div> </div><p>What is Hedkayse?</p><p><em><strong>Hedkayse is a revolutionary new helmet technology, design, and approach.</strong></em></p><p>We started with the challenge of creating a better folding helmet. But this quickly led us to completely rethink the design of cycle helmets, forcing us to develop our own our unique, safer, rugged, soft material 'Enkayse' to replace traditional Expanded Polystyrene EPS.</p><div>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.realisedesign.co.uk/clientspace/headkayse/Headkayse_Intro_01.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The resulting Hedkayse One is not only the simplest and most compact folding helmet possible, it's also a better all round helmet for cyclists.</p>
<p>Whatever, type of cycling you do, wherever you go - 'The One' Offers you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>INCREASED SAFETY</strong> - The world's first multiple-impact protection helmet, which conforms to world safety standards.</li>
<li>
<strong>TOUGHNESS!</strong> - Throw it on the floor, in a bag, wherever - it's fine. No more worrying about every small knock to your expensive but fragile helmet.</li>
<li>
<strong>ONE SIZE THAT FITS ALL</strong> - the flexibility &amp; patented adjustment system give the Headkayse unprecedented ability to fit any size of head, from children to large adults. It even quickly adapts to woolly hats!</li>
<li>
<strong>AMAZING COMFORT</strong> - Whatever shape your head is (we're all different!) Hedkayse will adjust &amp; mould to your head, quickly feeling incredibly comfy and secure.</li>
<li>
<strong>CUTTING EDGE STYLING</strong> - Carefully crafted to blend the best helmet shapes that suit the human head - Hedkayse looks surprisingly good on all people. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>Where are we?</h2>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The team have undertaken the research, testing and time to develop this solution. We have the design, we’ve tested it, and we have taken on-board the feedback. </p>
<p>We’re now ready for production.</p>
<p>We have designed, developed and will manufacture entirely in the UK; even the bag and strap webbing is made locally. We want to remain in control, overseeing every single step of this process in order to give you the very best.</p>
<p>Help us make this a commercial reality and enjoy the benefits of a Hedkayse helmet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Why do I need a flexible Helmet?</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Hedkayse embraces individuality. Because of its flexibility, and our patented adjustment system, the helmet simply just adapts to your head shape, making it more comfortable, fit more securely and look more compact.  For the first time since the days of leather helmets in the 1930’s, a cycle helmet conforms to your head shape. And it's truly one size fits ALL, need we say more?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447368870/bjycuxg8mgwn2xaphrpt.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>OK nothing personal but let's be honest, cycle helmets are pretty strange looking things on most people. Aerodynamic wedges for roadies are great if you're in the Tour de France, but a bit weird when yoou're just poppping to the shops. The 'skate park bowl' looks great on a dude with a BMX, but a bit suspect on a middle aged commuter.</p>
<p>So Hedkayse has been designed as an urban hybrid to look good wherever. Flexibility allows it to follow your head shape, meaning there's no sticky out bits making it look like you're wearing a plastic pie.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.realisedesign.co.uk/clientspace/headkayse/Headkayse_Styling_01.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>So how small does it pack?</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Clever use of materials means we don't need any crazy hinges and folding mechanisms. It just folds flat. Simple and quick.</p>
<p><b>Hedkayse flattens by 70% to just 5cm wide, reducing in volume by 50% from 5L to 2.5L</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447371085/xzycujsss2j7kkixvlvi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2>Is it tough?</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Hell yea - We've spent over three years exhaustively testing, retesting and testing again to get the in-depth material knowledge to develop ""Enkayse""</p>
<p>With this helmet, you can drop it on the floor, bosh, bang or scratch it and you don't need to worry about whether you *ought* to get a new one. Our unique “Enkayse” materials will just suck up the punishment and spit it back out! Hoo Ha!</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>For the last 40 years nearly all cycle helmets have used Expanded Polystyrene (EPS). It’s a good energy absorber at high speed impacts, but it's destroyed in the process, meaning traditional EPS cycle helmets only perform once; sacrificing themselves to absorb the energy and providing little help on a second hit.</p>
<p>At lower speeds EPS’s rigidity means a small knock passes the energy straight to your skull, adding up to some nasty long term affects to the brain. Try knocking your knuckles hard (not too hard) on the top of your EPS helmet – it’ll shake your eyeballs about.</p>
<p>So we set out to find a better material. During what turned out to be a much longer process than we thought, we discovered and tested many amazing materials, but none provided the protection we needed when exposed to real life heat or cold.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447370054/wkqxkjyzoumgvkbu7fxb.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>“Testing some of our prototype samples at Inspec Insternational Ltd”</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Helmet standards specify testing across a temperature range of -20deg C to +50deg C, a temperature range that, by a particular quirk, only suits the polystyrene helmets... Until now. </p>
<p><b>Enkayse</b> is the result of all our hard work. Its special combination of slow response and elasticity means it can absorb impacts without permanent damage, whilst the extremely tough outer protection layer is tear proof, and resistant to sharp objects.</p>
<p><b>Enkayse</b> exceeds the requirements of the European cycle helmet standard (EN1078), maintaining performance and keeping you safe.</p>

<p>The flexibility of <b>Enkayse</b> means it can absorb impacts without permanent damage whilst the extremely tough outer protection layer is tear proof, and resistant to sharp objects….Grrr!</p>
<p>When exposed to large impacts, traditional cycle helmets made from Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) only perform once; sacrificing themselves to absorb the energy. There is little forgiveness when exposed to small impacts which don’t meet the threshold for EPS to compress.</p>

<h2>What's next? Why we need you!</h2>
<p>This has been a huge undertaking for us. As a team we have already invested a substantial amount to bring us to pre-production. But we now need your help for a final push to get the product launched:</p>
<p>· Final production tweaks and detailing - For example, we're introducing an even tougher but thinner 3mm Shell Outer layer, which is flexible, enormously strong and tear/scratchproof.</p>
<p>· Setting up our UK production</p>
<p>· Establish shipping, logistics and warehousing partnerships</p>

<p> </p>
<p>We’re on an all or nothing route with Indiegogo so if we don’t make our target we’ll have to search hard to fill the gap (We’re eyeing up George’s kidneys as we type). But with your help this can happen NOW. Be part of our journey (Save George some pain) and become a proud Headkayser!...</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>How You Can Contribute - The Perks</h2>
<h4>Option 1 - buy helmets!</h4>
<p>There is of course the Early bird offers for those of you who help us early - important because Indiegogo will notice and boost the campaign.</p>
<p>Even better of course if you need more than one, how about the family pack (you'll save on postage)</p>
<p>Are you a club, shop or bike hire company? The ""team"" version gives you the early bird price and cheapest postage, WITH customised option of colour and branding applied to the helmets. Woop woop!""</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Option 2 - don't need a helmet but do want to contribute?</h4>
<p>...In that case donate £15 and get one of these luxurious HK branded Beanie hats as a huge warm thank you from us. This a lovely thermal head upgrade which feels warm whilst looking cool.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458046730/swugcwoc2idkyg6vngug.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Better still this will fit under a Hedkayse One (because it's so adjustable) converting that into a full winter helmet - great for keeping your ears warm while bashing into sleety winds.</p>
<p><strong>Or like snow sports?</strong> - the Hedkayse One + Beanie is perfect for hitting the slopes (hopefully not literally) and packs neatly into a rucksack. No annoying helmet hanging off the hand luggage.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Option 3 - Give a lucky loved one a Voucher</h4>
<p>There are a couple of ways of doing this:</p>
<p>1. Give them the £25 discount voucher - which secures them the Early Bird rate and £25 off, meaning they can buy a final Headkayse for £50. This is a great smaller present or mega stocking filler.</p>
<p>2. Go the whole hog and give them a Headkayse One for Christmas - or at least a voucher version of it. This gives them something to look forward to in 2016 other than a diet, and makes them feel part of this story.</p>
<p>For both of these options you will receive a beautifully designed voucher by email, which you can choose to print and give to your ""giftee"" (is that a word?). Each voucher will have a unique code linked to your name. Almost as good as a Wonker Chocolate Golden Ticket, and a lot more real.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>So - let's get on it... Oh Gosh LOOK Up There TOP RIGHT</strong> (hint hint!)</p>
<p>We need to achieve a £60K target in order to manufacture. But after that, here are some additional stretch goals we would love to include so your helmet will be even better.</p>

</div></div>","Production StatusThank you so much to all of our campaign backers - because of your support we are kicking off production. Our campaign is now closed but watch for news of our live launch later this year. _____________________________________________________________________  What is Hedkayse?Hedkayse is a revolutionary new helmet technology, design, and approach.We started with the challenge of creating a better folding helmet. But this quickly led us to completely rethink the design of cycle helmets, forcing us to develop our own our unique, safer, rugged, soft material 'Enkayse' to replace traditional Expanded Polystyrene EPS.
 

The resulting Hedkayse One is not only the simplest and most compact folding helmet possible, it's also a better all round helmet for cyclists.
Whatever, type of cycling you do, wherever you go - 'The One' Offers you:


INCREASED SAFETY - The world's first multiple-impact protection helmet, which conforms to world safety standards.

TOUGHNESS! - Throw it on the floor, in a bag, wherever - it's fine. No more worrying about every small knock to your expensive but fragile helmet.

ONE SIZE THAT FITS ALL - the flexibility & patented adjustment system give the Headkayse unprecedented ability to fit any size of head, from children to large adults. It even quickly adapts to woolly hats!

AMAZING COMFORT - Whatever shape your head is (we're all different!) Hedkayse will adjust & mould to your head, quickly feeling incredibly comfy and secure.

CUTTING EDGE STYLING - Carefully crafted to blend the best helmet shapes that suit the human head - Hedkayse looks surprisingly good on all people. 

 
Where are we?
 
 
The team have undertaken the research, testing and time to develop this solution. We have the design, we’ve tested it, and we have taken on-board the feedback. 
We’re now ready for production.
We have designed, developed and will manufacture entirely in the UK; even the bag and strap webbing is made locally. We want to remain in control, overseeing every single step of this process in order to give you the very best.
Help us make this a commercial reality and enjoy the benefits of a Hedkayse helmet.
 
 
Why do I need a flexible Helmet?
 
Hedkayse embraces individuality. Because of its flexibility, and our patented adjustment system, the helmet simply just adapts to your head shape, making it more comfortable, fit more securely and look more compact.  For the first time since the days of leather helmets in the 1930’s, a cycle helmet conforms to your head shape. And it's truly one size fits ALL, need we say more?
 

OK nothing personal but let's be honest, cycle helmets are pretty strange looking things on most people. Aerodynamic wedges for roadies are great if you're in the Tour de France, but a bit weird when yoou're just poppping to the shops. The 'skate park bowl' looks great on a dude with a BMX, but a bit suspect on a middle aged commuter.
So Hedkayse has been designed as an urban hybrid to look good wherever. Flexibility allows it to follow your head shape, meaning there's no sticky out bits making it look like you're wearing a plastic pie.

 
So how small does it pack?
 
Clever use of materials means we don't need any crazy hinges and folding mechanisms. It just folds flat. Simple and quick.
Hedkayse flattens by 70% to just 5cm wide, reducing in volume by 50% from 5L to 2.5L
 

Is it tough?
 
Hell yea - We've spent over three years exhaustively testing, retesting and testing again to get the in-depth material knowledge to develop ""Enkayse""
With this helmet, you can drop it on the floor, bosh, bang or scratch it and you don't need to worry about whether you *ought* to get a new one. Our unique “Enkayse” materials will just suck up the punishment and spit it back out! Hoo Ha!
 
Is it safe? Yes!

 
 
 
For the last 40 years nearly all cycle helmets have used Expanded Polystyrene (EPS). It’s a good energy absorber at high speed impacts, but it's destroyed in the process, meaning traditional EPS cycle helmets only perform once; sacrificing themselves to absorb the energy and providing little help on a second hit.
At lower speeds EPS’s rigidity means a small knock passes the energy straight to your skull, adding up to some nasty long term affects to the brain. Try knocking your knuckles hard (not too hard) on the top of your EPS helmet – it’ll shake your eyeballs about.
So we set out to find a better material. During what turned out to be a much longer process than we thought, we discovered and tested many amazing materials, but none provided the protection we needed when exposed to real life heat or cold.
 

 
“Testing some of our prototype samples at Inspec Insternational Ltd”
 
Helmet standards specify testing across a temperature range of -20deg C to +50deg C, a temperature range that, by a particular quirk, only suits the polystyrene helmets... Until now. 
Enkayse is the result of all our hard work. Its special combination of slow response and elasticity means it can absorb impacts without permanent damage, whilst the extremely tough outer protection layer is tear proof, and resistant to sharp objects.
Enkayse exceeds the requirements of the European cycle helmet standard (EN1078), maintaining performance and keeping you safe.

 

 
 
The flexibility of Enkayse means it can absorb impacts without permanent damage whilst the extremely tough outer protection layer is tear proof, and resistant to sharp objects….Grrr!
When exposed to large impacts, traditional cycle helmets made from Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) only perform once; sacrificing themselves to absorb the energy. There is little forgiveness when exposed to small impacts which don’t meet the threshold for EPS to compress.

<p>Approximately 10% of children worldwide, and a full third of children in the United States, are obese. Of these children, 70% of them have at least one risk factor for cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>1 out of 7 low-income, preschool-aged children are obese, and this is no coincidence! Many children who come from low-income families do not have access to the physical education or facilities that they need to stay active and stay healthy.</p>
<h2>There is Help!</h2>
<p>Team for Kids is an organization that helps fund health and fitness programs for children who would otherwise have little to no access to regular physical activity.</p>
<p>TFK's programs serve 100,000 children each year in more than 400 community centers and schools in the United States and in Africa.</p>
<h2>My Part</h2>
<p>In order to raise money for this amazing organization, I am running the 2012 ING New York City Marathon. Yes, all 26.2 miles of it! My goal is to raise $2,844 for this organization. $2,844 represents the number of miles I will have run in 1 year on the day of the marathon, November 4th, 2012.</p>
<p>Training for the marathon and being able to raise money for Team for Kids has truly been amazing.</p>
<h2>What You Can Do!</h2>
<p>For starters, run the marathon. Just kidding! I am only asking for your money! =) All donations are welcome, big and small. Please help to support TFK by donating any amount. You will help children living in low-income areas get physically healthy.</p>
<p>Then, come support the marathoners (including your truly) in person on November 4th, starting at 8:30am in all Five Boroughs of New York City.</p>

</h3><p>My name is Shay and I  work with baby Kaden's mother, Angie Griffith. At the age of 6 weeks old, Kaden was diagnosed with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA Type 1). It all began when he was not able to hold his head up and he seemed he was losing strength in his arms and legs, Angie and her husband rushed Kaden to the Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City MO where they did multiple test and genetic testing which came back positive for SMA type 1. The medical team at CMH explained the disease and the prognosis as not good. SMA type 1 is a very serious disease and most kids do not live long because it affects and deteriorates the muscle which will affect his lungs, and his ability to eat. At this point while Kaden is healthy, they have an appointment for him to have a GI tube inserted so when the time comes they can still feed him.  They have many more doctor visits and hospital visits in their future, which can add up and become very costly and not to mention all of the medical equipment such as bi-pap, c-pap machine, and new car seat that lays down in the back of a car so when the time comes he can lay down to help him breath. I am asking for donations to help support this family and help pay any medical bills or pay for any equipment that is not covered by insurance. This is a terrible disease and no family should have to deal with and watch their child die slowly. It is very heartbreaking and I want to try to help them out as much as possible so they can spend every moment with Kaden and not worry about expenses. Please help out this family in this tough time. If you want to learn more about SMA here is a website that explains the disease in more detail fsma.org. Thank you!</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>

The management of the community will be delegated to two teams:
- a BOARD of DIRECTORS, composed by the President
and 6 others directors; three of them named by the President and three elected
every two years by BVAW 2.0 Gold members. The board will have mainly in
charge the definition of the annual calendar of BVAW events and the official
partnership with institutions.

- a TECHNICAL COMMITTEE, composed by 5 people named by the Board of Directors
every two years.
They have mainly to coach and support  all
members interested in organizing a BVAW event and to assessment and validate all event proposals coming from the members.

 There will be two kinds of members:
- Gold Members: those who really believe in BVAW 2.0 and partecipate to the crowdfunding campaign by paying (at least) 50 dollars. They will be lifetime members and will enjoy BVAW 2.0 forever! Moreover, they will also have the right to vote, every two years, for the election of three directors in the Board of Directors.

BE CAREFUL : Available only during the crowfunding campaign



- Members: everyone can decide in any moment to become a member of BVAW 2.0 by paying a 25 dollars as annual fee.  Take this chance: for this crowdfunding campaign those who choose the perk of 25 dollars will become member for two years

<p><strong>What you are supporting:</strong></p>

<p><strong>More About Me:</strong></p>
<p>For over 2 years I have made healing available to people of all backgrounds and financial income.</p>
<p>Within this time my beloved partner,John Kazar- founder of the Boutique Yoga space, have been hosting shamans and other healers from around the world to provide extremely deep and powerful healing.</p>

<h3>My nephew Ian. What can I say he is the most amazing child I have ever met with the most amazing sense of humor and always greats you with a smile. He is resilient and strong yet every day he faces pain constant pain.</h3>
<h3>Ian has what's known as EB (Epidermolysis Bullosa). you may ask ""what is that""? Well it is an inherited connective tissue disease causing blisters in the skin and mucosal membranes, Its severity ranges from mild to lethal.</h3>
<h3>
<br/>As a result, the skin is extremely fragile. Minor friction or trauma will separate the layers of the skin and form blisters. Often referred to as Butterfly Children due to the fact that their skin is as fragile as the wings of a butterfly. It's much like a severe burn in Ian's case all over his body. Ian lives in severe pain on constant pain medication to try to help keep him comfortable. <br/> A bump or scratch or even moving the wrong way can case the skin blister and break. It's a constant battle, one area of the skin heals and then blisters again or won't heal at all. Scar tissue develops making it even worse restricting the movement of arms and legs and even opening the mouth. It doesn't stop there, blisters also develop internally in the eyes, nose, mouth and throat. For EB kids the risk of infection is high and can be fatal. Regular bandage changes are required and are nothing short of horrible and extremely painful.</h3>
<h3>
<br/>In short it is a horrific disease, extremely painful and debilitating. Ian was born with RDEB which is considered to be a severe strain of this disease. Ian is bandaged from head to toe  with blistering and open wounds over most of his body. Ian is unable to walk and is confined to a wheel chair. Ian can not sit up on his own or dress himself and requires constant care. When born Ian was not given much chance of survival and wasn't expected to still be with us today. It is a shear miracle Ian is still with us today and has reached the age of 14.</h3>
<h3>
<br/>87% of children born with one of the more sever forms of EB like Ian's do not live more then 12 months.</h3>
<h3>
<br/> Ian enjoys arts and crafts, likes painting and drawing and watching the Food Network on TV. He enjoys spending time with his Brothers and Sister and his little kitten. Ian dreams of being a Firefighter when he grows up. He collects firefighting memorabilia and just loves all things do do with firefighting. He has an amazing attitude for a child who is in so much pain. With all the procedures he has to endure Ian still manages to retain his sense of humor and I don't know how.</h3>
<h3>
<br/>Ian had the chance of a life time a few weeks ago to travel to Ohio to the Cincinnati Children's Hospital EB Clinic. The reason for his visit was to tackle the issue of how Ian will be able to eat. <br/> Ian has a feeding tube in his nose which provides him with vital nutrition. However in order to continue to insert a feeding tube every few months Ian has to undergo the procedure of having his esophagus dilated. This is alway a risky procedure as the esophagus is very thin and fragile to start with. Ian has had this procedure so many times it is no longer safe to continue to insert this tube. Without it Ian would be unable to eat and unable to survive. High amounts of nutrition are required to help the body heal the skin and fight infection.</h3>
<h3>
<br/>His trip to Cincinnati was to hopefully find another way for Ian to be given food. In the past other methods had been tried and failed due to the deterioration of his skin.</h3>
<h3>
<br/> Ian's visit was a huge success in one way as the doctors will in the coming weeks be able to dilate his esophagus and remove the tube from his nose. However he will have to under go a surgical procedure to insert a Mickey Button in his belly. At the same time Ian will have to have a total of 10 teeth removed, children with EB often have huge issues with teeth.</h3>
<h3>
<br/>If that is not enough during his visit to Cincinnati it was discovered that his spleen and liver were enlarged and after further investigation they found 2 tumors one on each adrenal gland. Ian has spent the last 4 weeks in Cincinatti Childrens Hospital. currentley they have discovered Ian has Fibrosis of the liver and his liver is leaking fluid and we have yet to find a resolution. </h3>
<h3>Ian is experiancing an awful lot of pain and is becoming very home sick for his family. Ian and Delicia have been alone at CCH while the rest of the family is at home. Ian is missing his family and his brothers and sister as well as his Daddy and Grandparents. He is finding it very hard at the moment.<br/> . <br/> Ian's brothers and sister have to continue with school and my sisters husband has to continue work to keep the roof over their head and it is going to be impossible for them to manage all this without help. A one income family who is struggling to survive as it is can not possible manage this and that's why we need your help.</h3>
<h3>Our aim is to raise as much as we can to help cover the costs the on going costs for Delicia and Ian to remain at CCH and to assist the family with visits on the weekend to help keep Ian's spirits up.</h3>
<h3>Any future medical care for Ian will be address in Cincinnati as they have the specialist with the experience needed to treat Ian. The local hospital where Ian has been treated feels that Ian's medical needs have become to specialized for them to continue to handle. So Ian will now be faced with traveling to Cincinnati for just about everything.</h3>

</div></div>","My nephew Ian. What can I say he is the most amazing child I have ever met with the most amazing sense of humor and always greats you with a smile. He is resilient and strong yet every day he faces pain constant pain.
Ian has what's known as EB (Epidermolysis Bullosa). you may ask ""what is that""? Well it is an inherited connective tissue disease causing blisters in the skin and mucosal membranes, Its severity ranges from mild to lethal.

As a result, the skin is extremely fragile. Minor friction or trauma will separate the layers of the skin and form blisters. Often referred to as Butterfly Children due to the fact that their skin is as fragile as the wings of a butterfly. It's much like a severe burn in Ian's case all over his body. Ian lives in severe pain on constant pain medication to try to help keep him comfortable.  A bump or scratch or even moving the wrong way can case the skin blister and break. It's a constant battle, one area of the skin heals and then blisters again or won't heal at all. Scar tissue develops making it even worse restricting the movement of arms and legs and even opening the mouth. It doesn't stop there, blisters also develop internally in the eyes, nose, mouth and throat. For EB kids the risk of infection is high and can be fatal. Regular bandage changes are required and are nothing short of horrible and extremely painful.

In short it is a horrific disease, extremely painful and debilitating. Ian was born with RDEB which is considered to be a severe strain of this disease. Ian is bandaged from head to toe  with blistering and open wounds over most of his body. Ian is unable to walk and is confined to a wheel chair. Ian can not sit up on his own or dress himself and requires constant care. When born Ian was not given much chance of survival and wasn't expected to still be with us today. It is a shear miracle Ian is still with us today and has reached the age of 14.

87% of children born with one of the more sever forms of EB like Ian's do not live more then 12 months.

 Ian enjoys arts and crafts, likes painting and drawing and watching the Food Network on TV. He enjoys spending time with his Brothers and Sister and his little kitten. Ian dreams of being a Firefighter when he grows up. He collects firefighting memorabilia and just loves all things do do with firefighting. He has an amazing attitude for a child who is in so much pain. With all the procedures he has to endure Ian still manages to retain his sense of humor and I don't know how.

Ian had the chance of a life time a few weeks ago to travel to Ohio to the Cincinnati Children's Hospital EB Clinic. The reason for his visit was to tackle the issue of how Ian will be able to eat.  Ian has a feeding tube in his nose which provides him with vital nutrition. However in order to continue to insert a feeding tube every few months Ian has to undergo the procedure of having his esophagus dilated. This is alway a risky procedure as the esophagus is very thin and fragile to start with. Ian has had this procedure so many times it is no longer safe to continue to insert this tube. Without it Ian would be unable to eat and unable to survive. High amounts of nutrition are required to help the body heal the skin and fight infection.

His trip to Cincinnati was to hopefully find another way for Ian to be given food. In the past other methods had been tried and failed due to the deterioration of his skin.

 Ian's visit was a huge success in one way as the doctors will in the coming weeks be able to dilate his esophagus and remove the tube from his nose. However he will have to under go a surgical procedure to insert a Mickey Button in his belly. At the same time Ian will have to have a total of 10 teeth removed, children with EB often have huge issues with teeth.

If that is not enough during his visit to Cincinnati it was discovered that his spleen and liver were enlarged and after further investigation they found 2 tumors one on each adrenal gland. Ian has spent the last 4 weeks in Cincinatti Childrens Hospital. currentley they have discovered Ian has Fibrosis of the liver and his liver is leaking fluid and we have yet to find a resolution. 
Ian is experiancing an awful lot of pain and is becoming very home sick for his family. Ian and Delicia have been alone at CCH while the rest of the family is at home. Ian is missing his family and his brothers and sister as well as his Daddy and Grandparents. He is finding it very hard at the moment. .  Ian's brothers and sister have to continue with school and my sisters husband has to continue work to keep the roof over their head and it is going to be impossible for them to manage all this without help. A one income family who is struggling to survive as it is can not possible manage this and that's why we need your help.
Our aim is to raise as much as we can to help cover the costs the on going costs for Delicia and Ian to remain at CCH and to assist the family with visits on the weekend to help keep Ian's spirits up.
Any future medical care for Ian will be address in Cincinnati as they have the specialist with the experience needed to treat Ian. The local hospital where Ian has been treated feels that Ian's medical needs have become to specialized for them to continue to handle. So Ian will now be faced with traveling to Cincinnati for just about everything.

We just can't afford to cover the trips to Ohio alone we need to raise as much as we can to help Ian and his family during this very dificult time. The cost of travel, food, accommodation for extended stays will mount quickly and Ian really need your help.
If you could find in your heart to help Ian it would mean the world to Ian and his family. Any donation no matter how small can help. If you would like to offer any assistance at all in any way please email at helpian@hotmail.com.We will be posting regular updates on Ian's Facebook Page,

<p>I’m Ruth Ann Bowen and I’m Dave Lutzweiler’s daughter.  As most of you know, my dad has Squamous-Cell Carcinoma.  This is a rare and aggressive form of cancer.  The tumor is currently located in his left jaw which is swollen outward approximately 3 inches and stretches about 5 inches across his face.</p>
<p>Conventional treatment meant cutting away a major portion of his lower-left face, followed by radiation and chemotherapy.  The doctors offered no guarantees or reassurances.  Therefore, he opted for alternative hyperthermia treatments in Germany; he has been there twice and will likely need to return.</p>
<p>We all know that dealing with insurance companies these days is both complicated and frustrating.  My dad's insurance company refused to pay anything toward these treatments.  He was then forced to pay out of pocket on his credit cards.  This has left my parents in a dire financial situation.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Frankly, they need your help.  Without your assistance they simply cannot pay their bills.  His creditors are demanding payments immediately.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You know my father.  He would not ask for help if it wasn't truly needed, and he's spent a lifetime helping others.  To be honest, it took a lot of work to convince him to allow me to start this campaign.</p>
<p>Every penny you donate will go to paying the cost of these cancer treatments.  In doing this, you will literally save my parents from financial ruin.  Furthermore, you just might help save his life.</p>
<p>By donating to this cause you'll also be making a statement about our choices in medical care.  Currently, insurance companies and drug companies hold all the cards.  They refuse to allow doctors and patients viable alternatives.  This is unacceptable.  My dad shouldn't have been made to choose between having his face disfigured beyond recognition and flying to Germany for weeks at a time.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know you might not be able to assist financially.  The economy has hit many of us very hard.  You can still pray.  You can still ask others to pray.  You can get the word out to others who might be interested in aiding my father in this life and death struggle.</p>
<p>Please remember to use the Indiegogo share tools!</p>

It actually felt quite odd to him initially, because he couldn't understand where were dreams like that coming from...</span></span></div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>But in a short time he started feeling sort of internal pressure, because he felt that if this idea could be changed into a real functional catheter, it could truly revolutionize the present practice and procedure of catheterization and more importantly, it could really, really help a lot of seriously ill people.</span><br/><span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>It is likely no coincidence that he has a unique mix of experience in this particular area - he underwent multiple catheterization as a patient, because he spent two years in hospitals recovering from serious injuries he suffered from rock-climbing. In addition, in his work as a doctor and surgeon he often applied catheters to his patients. Being able to experience these procedures from both sides has compelled him to dedicate all of his efforts over the past year to this project and bring these catheters to people in need.</span>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">But the fact is, that this project is designed for people who will appreciate the advantages of RIOCATH catheterization, because their lives depends on them being able to use urinal catheters several times per day – that’s especially true for paraplegics and similarly affected people practicing so called ""intermittent catheterization"", modern way of bladder management. Especially for these people our catheter will be of valuable help by protecting them from urinary tract infections, injuries and consequently increasing their quality of life…</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Very close to these patients are also home care and healthcare insurance companies, who are involved in long term care of patients, which can also benefit very much from this project.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">And finally, we would like to maximize production of our catheters to make them available to as many patients as possible. We therefore offer medical device producers an open license for the duration of our patent protection (c/a 20 years).</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","Riocath catheter represents a new method of catheterization of urinary bladder which is expected to virtually eliminate pain and trauma during insertion as well as the risk of urinary tract infection often caused by catheterization. It is suitable both for all acute urinary bladder catheterizations as well as for paraplegics´ who require chronic, intermittent catheterization.   How the “IDEA” evolved…   It may sound crazy but the inventor of Riocath catheters, Dr. Miroslav Svoboda,  literally woke up one morning with the idea of inside-out principle of catheterization in his head. It actually felt quite odd to him initially, because he couldn't understand where were dreams like that coming from...
But in a short time he started feeling sort of internal pressure, because he felt that if this idea could be changed into a real functional catheter, it could truly revolutionize the present practice and procedure of catheterization and more importantly, it could really, really help a lot of seriously ill people.It is likely no coincidence that he has a unique mix of experience in this particular area - he underwent multiple catheterization as a patient, because he spent two years in hospitals recovering from serious injuries he suffered from rock-climbing. In addition, in his work as a doctor and surgeon he often applied catheters to his patients. Being able to experience these procedures from both sides has compelled him to dedicate all of his efforts over the past year to this project and bring these catheters to people in need.
  Legal coverage - Riocath Medical Devices, a.s. (Inc.)At present, we have established a company dedicated to development, production and marketing of catheters based on the “inside-out” RIOCATH principle. Shareholders in this corporation are, besides the inventor, also some of his business partners as well as strategic partners you have heard mentioned in the videos. We have determined that a private corporation (designated by Inc. in the US or a.s. in Czech) is the most appropriate form of legal entity for this purpose.   Target groups
Above anything else we would be happy for support from anybody who will find this idea beneficial and useful and we hope you will use ongoing Christmas and advent time to make a sincere decision.
But the fact is, that this project is designed for people who will appreciate the advantages of RIOCATH catheterization, because their lives depends on them being able to use urinal catheters several times per day – that’s especially true for paraplegics and similarly affected people practicing so called ""intermittent catheterization"", modern way of bladder management. Especially for these people our catheter will be of valuable help by protecting them from urinary tract infections, injuries and consequently increasing their quality of life…
Very close to these patients are also home care and healthcare insurance companies, who are involved in long term care of patients, which can also benefit very much from this project.
And finally, we would like to maximize production of our catheters to make them available to as many patients as possible. We therefore offer medical device producers an open license for the duration of our patent protection (c/a 20 years).
For all these groups we prepared Perks specifically designed for each of them.
 
 
What we wantWe are also offering to all producers an opportunity to apply RIOCATH principle according to their needs and wishes. Anybody can buy an open license for a very reasonable fee and start production of its own line of catheters based on the RIOCATH principle.With the help of market-management tools, especially by keeping the price of our own products affordable and fully comparable to price of standard catheters, we will regulate the price of RIOCATH urinary catheters at the level of present catheters. We will need to build up our own producing plant to be able to fulfill this. Despite the tremendous advantages of our RIOCATH catheters we WILL NOT charge any „additional premium“.   Our supportersFirst, we would like to stress that because of the collective efforts of all involved parties we have passed the idea stage and moved to a completely defined project phase with a proven prototype, developed manufacturing solution and a strong professional team. We are supported by Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry (well known as the workplace of professor Holy, inventor of the most effective medicals for treating of AIDS. We are fully prepared and equipped to realize the project.   How we will use fundsDuring the year 2015 we will complete all phases of development, enforcing of global patent protection, clinical testing, certification and registration minimally in the EU and USA.Also we are in a close co-operation with a company specialized in 3D printing. Currently we are using 3D printing for the production of master models and molds. We expect being able to apply this technology on production level enabling direct 3D printing of catheters for us.     Budget  (in thousands of USD)

We were married on July 30th, 2011 and headed down the happy life. It continued when we found out we were pregnant with our soon to be grace of a daughter Kylie on Feburary 16th, 2012. On May 10th, 2012 we found out baby Kylie was hydronephrosis on her kidneys. At that time we were unsure of what that was or how it effected our baby, however we would soon get the diagnosis and scare of our lives. If one of her kidneys was damaged or non-functioning Kylie would be able to do so many things in life unaffected, with no kidneys there was nothing she could do but hold on after birth and live on dialysis until a donor could be found. </p><p>     The ultrasound when Audra was 20 weeks pregnant with Kylie had numerous abnormalities that concerned every doctor and tech in the room. Both kidneys were retaining fluid round the skin of the kidney and starting to squeeze the kindeys effecting their ability to work even then. After that we had to have a weekly ultrasounds to monitor how the kidneys were developing (not well). Hard decisions had to be made even before Kylie was born so we had a plan of action when she was born. Doctors were brought in specializing in pediatric kidney problems, a surgical team, and counsellors to help us better understand what was going on and how to deal with it. It was decided that within 24 hours of being born we would need to have a radioligical study performed, this was to be the first of many. She was poked, prodded, sedated and placed in a catheter to be tested for hours shortly after her birth to find out one kydney functioned at 50% of normal and the other at 10% of normal capicity.</p><p>   Her left kydney was obstructed and could not function normally. She had fluid building up around her kidney, she also had reflux on the same side pushing fluid back from her bladder. Three issues on the same side was unheard of according to all the doctors studying the case. It was at this time she was labeled as having sever hydronephrosis. The severity of her diagnosis was so much of a mystery that three her doctors wrote papers and journals on the findings. This however did not offer any solution on how to correct the issue. A temporary solution was to put her on antibiotics from day 1 to limit any possible urinary tract infections due to the reflux; however, this has caused Kylie to build an immunity to common childhood antibiotics and has not given her immune system a chance to develop. This has done nothing to fix her kidney problems, just eleviate a possible system.</p><p>   Kylie has had 20 ultrasounds starting in utero, 2 renograms (a nuclear medicine test where she is sedated, administered a radioactive dye through an IV, then placed under an X-ray machine for an hour taking constant pictures), 11 ER visits, and over 50 consults with pediatric kidney specialists, surgeons, primary pediatrician, pre-natal physichians, and counsellors. Kylie has made it all the way to the operating table, but it was cancelled while in surgery because the surgeon believed she was cured once on the table. His reasoning was because of a camera and dye test that he did prior to operating, he claims miraculously that she healed herself and it was the first of 30 years of practice. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/656362/files/20140617163014-KylieHospital.jpg?1403047814"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Unfortunately another ultrasound and meeting with the pediatric kidney specialist shows that Kylie is now worse than she has ever been.

<h2><strong>          </strong></h2>
<h2><strong>               INTRO AND SUMMARY OF MY PLEA</strong></h2>
<p>Every day I feel the impact and torturous effects of constant pervasive “pure tone” noise in my environment and home, in the quiet town of Monterey, MA.</p>
<p>I am not alone. </p>
<p>Dozens of witnesses have heard the same noxious tones while visiting our town.  Some, forced to shorten their visit, reported to State Public Health Officials about symptoms of pressure in their heads, waking up repeatedly throughout the night, feeling nauseous, anxious, overheated, and experiencing heart palpitations, and problems with hearing aids. </p>
<p>Others report hearing the noise in their own towns.  Day after I day I hear from people suffering like myself.</p>
<p>Several experts who have investigated this noise, report it is a byproduct of radio frequency radiation pollution caused by dirty electricity, wireless telecommunication devices, DSL, Wi-Fi, and wireless meters.  The air in my town, and yours, is different than it was 10 years ago.  Now it is polluted with invisible carcinogenic electromagnetic radio frequency radiation and its byproducts, pure tone noise, delivered to every neighborhood and home by way of the new emerging Smart Grid infrastructure.  </p>
<p>While higher ambient levels in urban towns (cars, traffic, industries) may disguise the pure tone noise that is so clearly heard in rural areas like Monterey, the hazard of the radiation is equally distributed across the nation.   Our children now play on playgrounds and baseball fields blanketed with free-flying microwaves and the resulting pure tones, blending eerily with sounds of birds chirping and wind through the trees.  This pollution will only get worse, as wireless technology increases exponentially each day.  </p>
<p>The advancement of the smart grid infrastructure coupled with wireless microwave transmitting devices has created a dragon of pollution for all of us to fight.  </p>
<p>I have waged my own battle with utility companies in MA for over 6 years.   Without any background in electricity or radio frequencies, I have been able to persist despite scant legal assistance.  Most lawyers I consulted with confessed to an inadequate grasp of the subject, or demanded exorbitant retainers.   I spent hours, daily, learning about noise and radio frequency pollution, while attempting to work with State Regulatory Agencies, submitting complaint after complaint, in an effort to compel National Grid and Verizon to mitigate the pollution and end the noise byproduct.   Each time, State Regulatory Officials met behind closed doors with utility company representatives.  Each time, we were denied a proper hearing.   Each time, the State Regulatory Agencies allowed National Grid to design testing protocols that were blatantly inadequate.   Each time the tests were exposed for their flaws, State Regulatory Agencies failed to compel any corrective testing as per MA Law.  Each time, they failed to bring in independent experts to be sure testing would be done properly.  Each time, State agencies closed the case even when they had some data indicating a clear problem.   And each time, they ignored reams and reams of evidence provided from experts who substantiated our claims. </p>
<p>Is it any surprise that corporations have become so powerful and corrupt when State regulatory agencies collaborate with them to disguise the truth?</p>
<p>My days of waking up joyfully ready for a new day and its wonderful possibilities are gone.  Instead I wake up exhausted, picking up the phone, and calling again for help that doesn’t come.   It is like “Ground Hogs Day” The same hell repeating itself over and over and over.  </p>
<p>I have been willing to stand up alone to this dragon for over 6 years. The dragon has tried to divert me, exhaust me, to try to take me down the wrong path.  Each time I have exposed the truth.  Each time I have gained more insight, more knowledge of the way they work and what they are hiding.</p>
<p>I cannot walk away from this without accomplishing what I set out to do.  While this started out as an issue of my personal suffering, it has become an issue with global consequences.  Each day I hear from more and people suffering in the same way that I am.</p>
<p>Now I realize I need your help to bring this dragon to its knees, expose the truth about radio frequency pollution and the Smart Grid, and to begin to live without this torture.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE REST OF THE STORY, THE EVIDENCE, AND THE OUTCOME SO FAR</strong></p>
<p>I have done many years of homework and talked to hundreds of specialists to get to the truth.  The constant assault of high frequency hissing, buzzing, and rumbling harmonics led to nights, then months, then years of insomnia, nose bleeds, headaches (no previous history) nervous tension, sinus problems, skin rashes, frustration, and anger.   Up until that time I had been in perfect health.  In 2006, while being unable to escape the noise, I started an intensive investigation in my surroundings.  I began by evaluating all the appliances and electric wiring in my home.  They all checked out.  I brought in code enforcement officers and electrician after electrician to try to locate the source in my home, to no avail.   I consulted with audio experts, and power quality specialists.  I read every scientific study I could about the subject.  I called physicists and radio frequency experts.   I had many, many, many noise studies conducted of the air outside my home.  I purchased and was trained in the use of sensitive recording and analyzing equipment from certified electricians and audio engineers.  I paid numerous experts to study and explain the noise. </p>
<p>Here is what they have concluded: The source is outside my home and most likely related to telecommunication signals being broadcast in the environment and delivered to my home by way of the power lines.  These forensic audio experts, power quality engineers, and electricians all verified the presence of a <strong>constant</strong> <strong>man-made audio noise</strong> <strong>pulsing in the air 24/7.  </strong></p>
<p>Our experts confirmed each other’s studies, reporting that the signal delivered to our home, and many other homes across the State of MA and across the US, has microwave characteristics, bursting every second with a 1/8 second microburst.   It was discovered that the dominant audible frequency is 217Hz, originated by microwave signals in the Gigahertz range.  This frequency has been widely researched, with published studies considering it to be a cause of DNA strand breakage in the brain.  </p>
<p>An FCC engineer in Washington asked to see the noise studies and spectrum plot results obtained by our forensic audio expert, and was stunned to see same results in three different study locations.   Never before in the history of mankind has this microwave frequency exposure been so widespread.  This same FCC engineer advised the State Regulatory agencies to investigate the matter more closely.   However, the State Regulatory agencies rely on FCC standards.  The FCC’s guidelines for radio frequency radiation exposure were set in 1986, almost three decades before our current technology was introduced.   The FCC had no idea the extent of toxic emissions that would occur in our lifetime.   The advent of layers of wireless technology over the past thirty years has also created byproducts of the RF pollution, such as this constant noise leaking into our environments and homes.    The electric power grid provides one continuous web of connecting wires, which naturally act as antenna, carrying the torturous noise and illegal emissions as far and wide as the web itself.   Yet, the FCC regulations still stand, antiquated and woefully inadequate to address today’s current combined exposure levels.  </p>
<p>That is how time and again, the State Regulatory agencies and the FCC were able to wash their hands of the issue in my town.   What they won’t tell you is that this is going to get a lot worse for everyone if it hasn’t already done so. </p>
<p>Legislation allowing cell towers to be erected on buildings demonstrates how little interest the FCC has in the health impact of radiation and microwave pollution from cell towers.   Likewise, electric and utility companies are not fully regulated in their installation or use of radio frequency radiation or microwave wireless devices.  They have been permitted to install wireless transmitters in every town, without applying for permits, and without notifying customers, as they prepare for a widespread Smart Grid.  Already homes have been provided with wireless or Smart meters which contain these transmitters.  Soon the entire nation will be serviced under the widespread umbrella of the Smart Microwave Grid. </p>
<p>If you read about the “Smart Grid” on electric companies’ websites, like National Grid, they will use a lot of words but will explain very little.  They will call the system “intelligent” but they won’t tell you it utilizes radio frequency radiation or microwave signals through and across the airwaves to “read” your appliances and meters, and accumulate data about your usage habits to assist them in designing more profitable returns for the company.  They will not tell you that your home environment and the environment outside your home, and all areas with electric grid consumers, will be polluted with massive amounts of radio frequency radiation, microwaves.  No, they will mislead you with propaganda using words like “green” and environmentally friendly, when it is far from either.  They will not tell you that these microwaves are able to detect habits and trends in your daily life, and when you are home or away.  This is an invasion of privacy, and against the law.   </p>
<p> Even when people take matters into their own hands, and go to great lengths to remove wireless devices from their own homes, removing smart or wireless meters, removing EMF producing lights and appliances, installing radiation blocking devices, or using hard wired phone lines, it is impossible to escape the pollution.   All of the other wireless devices in neighborhoods and on neighbor’s homes will continue to broadcast the signal and contribute to the pollution of radiation in the environment. </p>
<p>Exposure is going to happen if you live in areas where wireless transmitters and devices are installed.  Wireless transmitting devices are installed on just about every section of the power lines, on every utility pole, on every street corner, on every home.  The amount in our environment now is far above what is normal for our planet and exceeds the amounts humans should be exposed to on a daily basis.   The World Health Organization deems radio frequency radiation emissions as potential carcinogens.</p>
<p>While this free flying air borne radiation is clearly a hazard, my fight is not about doing away with all radiation.  That would be impossible.  My fight is instead about mandating choices and minimizing exposure.   It is about awareness and prevention of harm.  There must be safer technology that will meet our needs as well as the current industry.   Safer options, such high speed internet utilizing fiber optics and wired phone service, have been relegated to take a back seat to wireless plans, with talk among industry leaders that they will soon be obsolete.  The government has not funded any studies to determine if wireless devices are safe.  Likewise, there are no studies by any source proving they are safe.  This gives free rein to the industry continuing to market wireless devices.   Left to their own schemes, the industry that promotes wireless devices has no interest in making safer choices.  They are purely interested in profit.  Our purchase of the technology and naïve use of it without an awareness of how it impacts our health is what they are banking on. </p>
<p><strong>WHO HAS ALLOWED THIS POLLUTION TO GO UNMITIGATED?</strong></p>
<p>The years I spent attempting to raise the consciousness of State Department Heads, speaking passionately about our suffering, have only resulted in apathetic indifference and accusations of harassment.  Kerry Bowie, Assistant Commissioner DEP, Barbara Kwetz DEP air and compliance, John Aurbach, Commissioner, Environmental Affairs, Martha Coakley, AGO’s office, EPA, FCC, Bob Knorr, Dept of Public Health, Governor Duval Patrick’s Office, Christine O’Toole, Department of Public Utilities, Karen Robinson, Director of Consumer complaints for DTC and DPU, our town officials, our Senator, Benjamin Downing, and our Rep, “Smitty” Pignatelli, have all dismissed my pleas for help, passing the word on to others that listening to me is a waste of their time. </p>
<p>The response from the utility companies has been just as dismal, with Corporate Officers like Verizon’s Cheryl Wenning, saying there is nothing they can do to assist us, and National Grid Corporate Representatives threatening us to stop communicating with their officers and technicians.  The State and the Utility companies have played a red tape, blame game, accusing the other of not cooperating or blaming them for delays or lack of contact.  The truth is that they work quite well together minimizing and then eliminating our concerns.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE ROLE OF THE FCC</strong></p>
<p>The FCC has allowed this to happen.  The FCC is allowing the current and drastically elevated amounts of a known carcinogenic to be delivered to all of us without demanding any updated assurances of safety, and without investigating the impact of levels far beyond what they imagined when they first set the standards for allowable exposure in 1986, decades before the advent of wireless technologies we live with today, exceeding the FCC’s original projections.  The FCC has not updated its guidelines to include it’s own recommendations to consider the amounts and combinations of wireless devices contributing to current exposure levels.   </p>
<p>The following information is taken directly from the FCC.  The points which are relevant to this issue, addressed above are underlined, (<em>FOLLOWED BY ITALISIZED COMMENTARY IN PARENTHESIS)</em>:</p>
<p> <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">On May 31, 2011, the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified radiofrequency fields as “possibly carcinogenic to humans.”</span> The <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">FCC guidelines are based on exposure criteria recommended in 1986 by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP)</span> and on the 1991 standard developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and later adopted as a standard by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI/IEEE C95.1-1992). (<em>tThis regulation is woefully outdated and did not take into consideration the cumulative impact of the huge amounts of wireless technology bombarding us constantly.)</em></p>
<p>Determining whether a potential health hazard could exist with respect to a given transmitting antenna is not always a simple matter.   <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Several important factors must be considered</span> in making that determination.   They include the following: (1) What is the <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">frequency of the RF signal</span> being transmitted?  (2) What is the <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">operating power</span> of the transmitting station and what is the actual power radiated from the antenna? <a href=""#_ftn1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title="""">[1]</a> (3) <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">How long will someone be exposed to the RF signal at a given distance from the antenna?</span> (4) <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What other antennas are located in the area</span>, and <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">what is the exposure from those antennas?</span>  (<em>Current cumulative effects are understated.)</em></p>
<p>In practice, however, since it is unrealistic to measure separately the exposure of each square centimeter of the body, <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">actual compliance with the FCC limits on RF emissions should be determined by “spatially averaging” a person’s exposure over the projected area of an adult human body</span> (this concept is discussed in the FCC’s OET Bulletin 65). <em>(This may not address current significant direct exposure to particular areas of the body.)</em></p>
<p>Transmitters and antennas that operate at 300 MHz or lower include radio broadcast stations, some television broadcast stations, and certain personal wireless service facilities (<em>e.g</em>., some paging stations).  <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Most personal wireless services, including all cellular and PCS, as well as some television broadcast stations, operate at frequencies above 300 MHz.</span></p>
<p>The MPE limits are specified as time‑averaged exposure limits.  This means that exposure can be averaged over the identified time interval (30 minutes for general population/uncontrolled exposure or <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">6 minutes for occupational/controlled exposure</span>). <em>(Current exposure is not limited to 30 minutes, as it is constant, 24 x 7.)</em></p>

<p>Only until large groups of people unite and take a stand against the utility companies’ abuse of our rights, will change be realized.  We can demand safer progressive technology. We can expose the lies, demand the truth and demand less radio frequency exposure.</p>
<p>I believe this trampling of our constitutional rights is grounds for a Supreme Court Decision, and possible Class Action.  My goal is that such action will result in calling the utility companies and their affiliates to task, compelling them to spend the billions of blood money, made while compromising our well-being, to stop the Smart Grid and use our money to mitigate illegal and deadly emissions from existing wireless sources. </p>
<p>The utility companies know how to reduce the pollution. They just do not want to, nor are they required to, spend OUR money to do so.  Current regulatory standards have allowed them to do what they want to do at our cost.  </p>

<p> <strong>Please help me fight for the benefit of all of us.</strong></p>
<h3> WHAT I NEED AND WHAT YOU GET</h3>
<p>I knew I was fighting a dragon.  I did not realize how big and corrupt the dragon was.   I now know I cannot stand up to this dragon alone, especially when it is being fed by powerful interest groups and corporate funded government.  I need help in the form of numbers and financial donations, large and small, to fight the corrupt alliance between powerful utility companies, State government regulatory agencies, and the FCC. Money is the one tool of power that corporations will respect.  Money will enable us to fight a precedent setting legal battle.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">I need your help nationally.</span></p>
<p>The only way to fight this is to fight BIG and to expose this fight on a national scale.</p>
<p>I need your help to question the FCC and compel them to investigate the impact of exposure to combined radio frequency radiation devices.  </p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">I need your help to fight this in Massachusetts and other States.</span></p>
<p>I need your help to launch a full-scale legal battle against the Utility Corporations in our State and in many other States (often the same entity) who have allowed this pollution without restraint, creating a network of leaking radio frequency radiation and pure tone signals at never before experienced levels. </p>
<p>The State has failed to protect us, thereby causing serious, irreversible health risks to my family, my animals, our community, and me.  The same thing is happening in your towns and homes, and to you and your families.   We need your help to bring our State Regulatory Agencies to task, to compel them to do their jobs, and force the utility companies to end radio frequency radiation emissions. </p>
<p>The Utilities, especially power companies like National Grid, with blessings given by the State and Federal Regulatory Agencies, have been allowed to proceed at our peril, with advancements of wireless on an outdated grid infrastructure, a structure that cannot safely handle what has been placed upon it and one they themselves have admitted is in grave need of repair.  Leakage of radiofrequency electromagnetic pollution is pervasive wherever there are power lines.</p>
<p>My family and I want to hire a new team of lawyers now that we have what we need, evidence and grounds, to bring this case to light.  Your help will allow these lawyers to persevere on our behalf even in the face of political and corporate obstacles.  Our lawyers will want to hear from other MA State residents who are suffering from the same pollution.</p>
<p>This case will be precedent setting, making it that much easier for others who wish to follow suit in other States and globally.  Our team is willing to fight this until it is resolved, until the Regulatory Agencies and the FCC realize they may no longer ignore our demands. </p>
<p> If you have an interest in joining this legal battle, we need to hear from you.  If you have an interest in helping fund this legal case, your donations will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>The fight will be long and costly.  We can’t do it without your help.  We can’t do it alone.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">We need your help to help you.</span></p>
<p>Our fear is that the stress of what we are involuntarily being subjected to will manifest in epidemic illness for all of us.  There are thousands of homeowners who have fled their homes like refugees, seeking new homes or places where the radiation levels are tolerable, but are finding that extremely difficult because of the multiple layers of wireless radio frequency radiation technology and its pollution.  It has saturated every environment on the planet.  Many people are too sick to defend themselves and the major portion of the public are unaware of this pollution let alone the possibility that it may be the cause of health issues. </p>
<p>Your help will give a voice to millions of children and families.  We will speak out against the proliferation of massive levels of radio frequency radiation pollution so we can be restored the choice to live without illness. </p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">If you participate in this fight and/or send any amount of donation for our legal battle it will help.</span></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>THE IMPACT OF ACHIEVING OUR GOAL</h3>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">A single well-fought case can make a huge difference in many people’s lives, exposing the lies the utility companies have told and validating the truth others have experienced across the State and Nation</span>.  </p>
<p>The impact of this case is HUGE and will be felt on a personal, National, and global level, as everyone is impacted by radio frequency radiation pollution.</p>
<p>We have the right to a safe and hazard free environment.  </p>
<h3>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</h3>
<p>In addition to providing financila support, there are many other ways you can act now to help preserve a healthy legacy for our children and avoid one of illness and struggle for them to bear. </p>
<p>Not to act shows compliance with the increasing amounts of radio frequency radiation pollution, raising the risk of illness for all of us. </p>
<p>Awareness and activism are the only ways to force corporations to develop technology that will not harm us.   It is possible to create safe technology.  We have the brain power to do this.  We are accepting inferior products and technology because we don’t know any better.  How many of the ideas generated by physicists to help correct this problem are being explored by corporations?   How many of their ideas are being funded by our government?  ZERO. </p>
<p>Corporations who have one goal, profit, are cheating us from solutions that would preserve our well-being.  These corporations have kidnapped our Government.  </p>
<p>What can you do to be active in the fight against this pollution?</p>
<p>1.  We can come together as one strong voice demanding an end to this corrupt abuse of power.  We can bring our voices to Washington demanding effective regulatory legistation before it is too late.</p>
<p>2.  We can write letters to our editors again and again asking why our corporations are not being compelled by our government to design safer technology for us. </p>
<p>3.  I also encourage those who can hear and feel the symptoms to join me in this fight by filing the proper complaints with their respective Departments of Public Utilities, by signing petitions asking for updated research and lower acceptable RF levels.  THE FCC is woefully behind the times, has not proven that RF devices of the magnitude we are being forced to live with are safe, and has yet done nothing to help.</p>
<p>4.  We can demand all wireless or radio frequency transmitting devices be removed from our homes, such as Smart or wireless meters, and wireless modems. </p>
<p>5.  We can speak at schools and churches about the impact of radio frequency radiation for children, and ask that these institutions set an example for the safety of our children and families by reducing wireless technology in schools and churches. </p>
<p>These are just a few things we can do.</p>

<p> Thank you in advance for understanding the urgent call to act and for your generosity.</p>

</div></div>","INTRO AND SUMMARY OF MY PLEA
Every day I feel the impact and torturous effects of constant pervasive “pure tone” noise in my environment and home, in the quiet town of Monterey, MA.
I am not alone. 
Dozens of witnesses have heard the same noxious tones while visiting our town.  Some, forced to shorten their visit, reported to State Public Health Officials about symptoms of pressure in their heads, waking up repeatedly throughout the night, feeling nauseous, anxious, overheated, and experiencing heart palpitations, and problems with hearing aids. 
Others report hearing the noise in their own towns.  Day after I day I hear from people suffering like myself.
Several experts who have investigated this noise, report it is a byproduct of radio frequency radiation pollution caused by dirty electricity, wireless telecommunication devices, DSL, Wi-Fi, and wireless meters.  The air in my town, and yours, is different than it was 10 years ago.  Now it is polluted with invisible carcinogenic electromagnetic radio frequency radiation and its byproducts, pure tone noise, delivered to every neighborhood and home by way of the new emerging Smart Grid infrastructure.  
While higher ambient levels in urban towns (cars, traffic, industries) may disguise the pure tone noise that is so clearly heard in rural areas like Monterey, the hazard of the radiation is equally distributed across the nation.   Our children now play on playgrounds and baseball fields blanketed with free-flying microwaves and the resulting pure tones, blending eerily with sounds of birds chirping and wind through the trees.  This pollution will only get worse, as wireless technology increases exponentially each day.  
The advancement of the smart grid infrastructure coupled with wireless microwave transmitting devices has created a dragon of pollution for all of us to fight.  
I have waged my own battle with utility companies in MA for over 6 years.   Without any background in electricity or radio frequencies, I have been able to persist despite scant legal assistance.  Most lawyers I consulted with confessed to an inadequate grasp of the subject, or demanded exorbitant retainers.   I spent hours, daily, learning about noise and radio frequency pollution, while attempting to work with State Regulatory Agencies, submitting complaint after complaint, in an effort to compel National Grid and Verizon to mitigate the pollution and end the noise byproduct.   Each time, State Regulatory Officials met behind closed doors with utility company representatives.  Each time, we were denied a proper hearing.   Each time, the State Regulatory Agencies allowed National Grid to design testing protocols that were blatantly inadequate.   Each time the tests were exposed for their flaws, State Regulatory Agencies failed to compel any corrective testing as per MA Law.  Each time, they failed to bring in independent experts to be sure testing would be done properly.  Each time, State agencies closed the case even when they had some data indicating a clear problem.   And each time, they ignored reams and reams of evidence provided from experts who substantiated our claims. 
Is it any surprise that corporations have become so powerful and corrupt when State regulatory agencies collaborate with them to disguise the truth?
My days of waking up joyfully ready for a new day and its wonderful possibilities are gone.  Instead I wake up exhausted, picking up the phone, and calling again for help that doesn’t come.   It is like “Ground Hogs Day” The same hell repeating itself over and over and over.  
I have been willing to stand up alone to this dragon for over 6 years. The dragon has tried to divert me, exhaust me, to try to take me down the wrong path.  Each time I have exposed the truth.  Each time I have gained more insight, more knowledge of the way they work and what they are hiding.
I cannot walk away from this without accomplishing what I set out to do.  While this started out as an issue of my personal suffering, it has become an issue with global consequences.  Each day I hear from more and people suffering in the same way that I am.
Now I realize I need your help to bring this dragon to its knees, expose the truth about radio frequency pollution and the Smart Grid, and to begin to live without this torture.
 
THE REST OF THE STORY, THE EVIDENCE, AND THE OUTCOME SO FAR
I have done many years of homework and talked to hundreds of specialists to get to the truth.  The constant assault of high frequency hissing, buzzing, and rumbling harmonics led to nights, then months, then years of insomnia, nose bleeds, headaches (no previous history) nervous tension, sinus problems, skin rashes, frustration, and anger.   Up until that time I had been in perfect health.  In 2006, while being unable to escape the noise, I started an intensive investigation in my surroundings.  I began by evaluating all the appliances and electric wiring in my home.  They all checked out.  I brought in code enforcement officers and electrician after electrician to try to locate the source in my home, to no avail.   I consulted with audio experts, and power quality specialists.  I read every scientific study I could about the subject.  I called physicists and radio frequency experts.   I had many, many, many noise studies conducted of the air outside my home.  I purchased and was trained in the use of sensitive recording and analyzing equipment from certified electricians and audio engineers.  I paid numerous experts to study and explain the noise. 
Here is what they have concluded: The source is outside my home and most likely related to telecommunication signals being broadcast in the environment and delivered to my home by way of the power lines.  These forensic audio experts, power quality engineers, and electricians all verified the presence of a constant man-made audio noise pulsing in the air 24/7.  
Our experts confirmed each other’s studies, reporting that the signal delivered to our home, and many other homes across the State of MA and across the US, has microwave characteristics, bursting every second with a 1/8 second microburst.   It was discovered that the dominant audible frequency is 217Hz, originated by microwave signals in the Gigahertz range.  This frequency has been widely researched, with published studies considering it to be a cause of DNA strand breakage in the brain.  
An FCC engineer in Washington asked to see the noise studies and spectrum plot results obtained by our forensic audio expert, and was stunned to see same results in three different study locations.   Never before in the history of mankind has this microwave frequency exposure been so widespread.  This same FCC engineer advised the State Regulatory agencies to investigate the matter more closely.   However, the State Regulatory agencies rely on FCC standards.  The FCC’s guidelines for radio frequency radiation exposure were set in 1986, almost three decades before our current technology was introduced.   The FCC had no idea the extent of toxic emissions that would occur in our lifetime.   The advent of layers of wireless technology over the past thirty years has also created byproducts of the RF pollution, such as this constant noise leaking into our environments and homes.    The electric power grid provides one continuous web of connecting wires, which naturally act as antenna, carrying the torturous noise and illegal emissions as far and wide as the web itself.   Yet, the FCC regulations still stand, antiquated and woefully inadequate to address today’s current combined exposure levels.  
That is how time and again, the State Regulatory agencies and the FCC were able to wash their hands of the issue in my town.   What they won’t tell you is that this is going to get a lot worse for everyone if it hasn’t already done so. 
Legislation allowing cell towers to be erected on buildings demonstrates how little interest the FCC has in the health impact of radiation and microwave pollution from cell towers.   Likewise, electric and utility companies are not fully regulated in their installation or use of radio frequency radiation or microwave wireless devices.  They have been permitted to install wireless transmitters in every town, without applying for permits, and without notifying customers, as they prepare for a widespread Smart Grid.  Already homes have been provided with wireless or Smart meters which contain these transmitters.  Soon the entire nation will be serviced under the widespread umbrella of the Smart Microwave Grid. 
If you read about the “Smart Grid” on electric companies’ websites, like National Grid, they will use a lot of words but will explain very little.  They will call the system “intelligent” but they won’t tell you it utilizes radio frequency radiation or microwave signals through and across the airwaves to “read” your appliances and meters, and accumulate data about your usage habits to assist them in designing more profitable returns for the company.  They will not tell you that your home environment and the environment outside your home, and all areas with electric grid consumers, will be polluted with massive amounts of radio frequency radiation, microwaves.  No, they will mislead you with propaganda using words like “green” and environmentally friendly, when it is far from either.  They will not tell you that these microwaves are able to detect habits and trends in your daily life, and when you are home or away.  This is an invasion of privacy, and against the law.   
 Even when people take matters into their own hands, and go to great lengths to remove wireless devices from their own homes, removing smart or wireless meters, removing EMF producing lights and appliances, installing radiation blocking devices, or using hard wired phone lines, it is impossible to escape the pollution.   All of the other wireless devices in neighborhoods and on neighbor’s homes will continue to broadcast the signal and contribute to the pollution of radiation in the environment. 
Exposure is going to happen if you live in areas where wireless transmitters and devices are installed.  Wireless transmitting devices are installed on just about every section of the power lines, on every utility pole, on every street corner, on every home.  The amount in our environment now is far above what is normal for our planet and exceeds the amounts humans should be exposed to on a daily basis.   The World Health Organization deems radio frequency radiation emissions as potential carcinogens.
While this free flying air borne radiation is clearly a hazard, my fight is not about doing away with all radiation.  That would be impossible.  My fight is instead about mandating choices and minimizing exposure.   It is about awareness and prevention of harm.  There must be safer technology that will meet our needs as well as the current industry.   Safer options, such high speed internet utilizing fiber optics and wired phone service, have been relegated to take a back seat to wireless plans, with talk among industry leaders that they will soon be obsolete.  The government has not funded any studies to determine if wireless devices are safe.  Likewise, there are no studies by any source proving they are safe.  This gives free rein to the industry continuing to market wireless devices.   Left to their own schemes, the industry that promotes wireless devices has no interest in making safer choices.  They are purely interested in profit.  Our purchase of the technology and naïve use of it without an awareness of how it impacts our health is what they are banking on. 
WHO HAS ALLOWED THIS POLLUTION TO GO UNMITIGATED?
The years I spent attempting to raise the consciousness of State Department Heads, speaking passionately about our suffering, have only resulted in apathetic indifference and accusations of harassment.  Kerry Bowie, Assistant Commissioner DEP, Barbara Kwetz DEP air and compliance, John Aurbach, Commissioner, Environmental Affairs, Martha Coakley, AGO’s office, EPA, FCC, Bob Knorr, Dept of Public Health, Governor Duval Patrick’s Office, Christine O’Toole, Department of Public Utilities, Karen Robinson, Director of Consumer complaints for DTC and DPU, our town officials, our Senator, Benjamin Downing, and our Rep, “Smitty” Pignatelli, have all dismissed my pleas for help, passing the word on to others that listening to me is a waste of their time. 
The response from the utility companies has been just as dismal, with Corporate Officers like Verizon’s Cheryl Wenning, saying there is nothing they can do to assist us, and National Grid Corporate Representatives threatening us to stop communicating with their officers and technicians.  The State and the Utility companies have played a red tape, blame game, accusing the other of not cooperating or blaming them for delays or lack of contact.  The truth is that they work quite well together minimizing and then eliminating our concerns.
 
THE ROLE OF THE FCC
The FCC has allowed this to happen.  The FCC is allowing the current and drastically elevated amounts of a known carcinogenic to be delivered to all of us without demanding any updated assurances of safety, and without investigating the impact of levels far beyond what they imagined when they first set the standards for allowable exposure in 1986, decades before the advent of wireless technologies we live with today, exceeding the FCC’s original projections.  The FCC has not updated its guidelines to include it’s own recommendations to consider the amounts and combinations of wireless devices contributing to current exposure levels.   
The following information is taken directly from the FCC.  The points which are relevant to this issue, addressed above are underlined, (FOLLOWED BY ITALISIZED COMMENTARY IN PARENTHESIS):
 On May 31, 2011, the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified radiofrequency fields as “possibly carcinogenic to humans.” The FCC guidelines are based on exposure criteria recommended in 1986 by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) and on the 1991 standard developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and later adopted as a standard by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI/IEEE C95.1-1992). (tThis regulation is woefully outdated and did not take into consideration the cumulative impact of the huge amounts of wireless technology bombarding us constantly.)
Determining whether a potential health hazard could exist with respect to a given transmitting antenna is not always a simple matter.   Several important factors must be considered in making that determination.   They include the following: (1) What is the frequency of the RF signal being transmitted?  (2) What is the operating power of the transmitting station and what is the actual power radiated from the antenna? [1] (3) How long will someone be exposed to the RF signal at a given distance from the antenna? (4) What other antennas are located in the area, and what is the exposure from those antennas?  (Current cumulative effects are understated.)
In practice, however, since it is unrealistic to measure separately the exposure of each square centimeter of the body, actual compliance with the FCC limits on RF emissions should be determined by “spatially averaging” a person’s exposure over the projected area of an adult human body (this concept is discussed in the FCC’s OET Bulletin 65). (This may not address current significant direct exposure to particular areas of the body.)
Transmitters and antennas that operate at 300 MHz or lower include radio broadcast stations, some television broadcast stations, and certain personal wireless service facilities (e.g., some paging stations).  Most personal wireless services, including all cellular and PCS, as well as some television broadcast stations, operate at frequencies above 300 MHz.
The MPE limits are specified as time‑averaged exposure limits.  This means that exposure can be averaged over the identified time interval (30 minutes for general population/uncontrolled exposure or 6 minutes for occupational/controlled exposure). (Current exposure is not limited to 30 minutes, as it is constant, 24 x 7.)

NOTE 1: Occupational/controlled limits apply in situations in which persons are exposed as a consequence of their employment provided those persons are fully aware of the potential for exposure and can exercise control over their exposure.  Limits for occupational/controlled exposure also apply in situations when an individual is transient through a location where occupational/controlled limits apply provided he or she is made aware of the potential for exposure.
NOTE 2: General population/uncontrolled exposures apply in situations in which the general public may be exposed, or in which persons that are exposed as a consequence of their employment may not be fully aware of the potential for exposure or cannot exercise control over their exposure.
(The electric companies have their equipment all over the place, in effect making your environment and my environment an extension of their work place.  Technicians work on our lines, climb our utility poles and install equipment on our homes daily.  This is their work place.  However, residents are not afforded the same protections as the utility workers.  Furthermore, many of us are not aware of the exposure risks and if we are, cannot control it.)

[1] Power travels from a transmitter through cable or other connecting device to the radiating antenna.  “Operating power of the transmitting station” refers to the power that is fed from the transmitter (transmitter output power) into the cable or connecting device.  “Actual power radiated from the antenna” is the transmitter output power minus the power lost (power losses) in the connecting device plus an apparent increase in power (if any) due to the design of the antenna.   
 
NOW THAT YOU KNOW THE FACTS. . . . . . . 
WHY MUST WE WORK TOGETHER TO STOP THIS?
Only until large groups of people unite and take a stand against the utility companies’ abuse of our rights, will change be realized.  We can demand safer progressive technology. We can expose the lies, demand the truth and demand less radio frequency exposure.
I believe this trampling of our constitutional rights is grounds for a Supreme Court Decision, and possible Class Action.  My goal is that such action will result in calling the utility companies and their affiliates to task, compelling them to spend the billions of blood money, made while compromising our well-being, to stop the Smart Grid and use our money to mitigate illegal and deadly emissions from existing wireless sources. 
The utility companies know how to reduce the pollution. They just do not want to, nor are they required to, spend OUR money to do so.  Current regulatory standards have allowed them to do what they want to do at our cost.

Americans Beware: Nationwide Violations of FCC Radiation Limits 
at Wireless Antenna Sites

Mar 20, 2013 09:02 ETMARSHFIELD, VT--(Marketwire - Mar 20, 2013) - The EMRadiation Policy Institute (EMRPI) releases Videos revealing the FCC's failure to protect Americans from wireless radiofrequency (RF) radiation. US workers and families are at risk of overexposure to RF at hazardous levels. Hundreds of wireless industry-operated antenna sites from Maine to California have been tested by EMRPI and found to be in gross violation -- up to and in excess of 600% -- of the FCC's public exposure limits. These sites > ...Want to read more about it? http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/-1770139.htm

 Please help me fight for the benefit of all of us.
 WHAT I NEED AND WHAT YOU GET
I knew I was fighting a dragon.  I did not realize how big and corrupt the dragon was.   I now know I cannot stand up to this dragon alone, especially when it is being fed by powerful interest groups and corporate funded government.  I need help in the form of numbers and financial donations, large and small, to fight the corrupt alliance between powerful utility companies, State government regulatory agencies, and the FCC. Money is the one tool of power that corporations will respect.  Money will enable us to fight a precedent setting legal battle.
I need your help nationally.
The only way to fight this is to fight BIG and to expose this fight on a national scale.
I need your help to question the FCC and compel them to investigate the impact of exposure to combined radio frequency radiation devices.  
I need your help to fight this in Massachusetts and other States.
I need your help to launch a full-scale legal battle against the Utility Corporations in our State and in many other States (often the same entity) who have allowed this pollution without restraint, creating a network of leaking radio frequency radiation and pure tone signals at never before experienced levels. 
The State has failed to protect us, thereby causing serious, irreversible health risks to my family, my animals, our community, and me.  The same thing is happening in your towns and homes, and to you and your families.   We need your help to bring our State Regulatory Agencies to task, to compel them to do their jobs, and force the utility companies to end radio frequency radiation emissions. 
The Utilities, especially power companies like National Grid, with blessings given by the State and Federal Regulatory Agencies, have been allowed to proceed at our peril, with advancements of wireless on an outdated grid infrastructure, a structure that cannot safely handle what has been placed upon it and one they themselves have admitted is in grave need of repair.  Leakage of radiofrequency electromagnetic pollution is pervasive wherever there are power lines.
My family and I want to hire a new team of lawyers now that we have what we need, evidence and grounds, to bring this case to light.  Your help will allow these lawyers to persevere on our behalf even in the face of political and corporate obstacles.  Our lawyers will want to hear from other MA State residents who are suffering from the same pollution.
This case will be precedent setting, making it that much easier for others who wish to follow suit in other States and globally.  Our team is willing to fight this until it is resolved, until the Regulatory Agencies and the FCC realize they may no longer ignore our demands. 
 If you have an interest in joining this legal battle, we need to hear from you.  If you have an interest in helping fund this legal case, your donations will be greatly appreciated.
The fight will be long and costly.  We can’t do it without your help.  We can’t do it alone.
We need your help to help you.
Our fear is that the stress of what we are involuntarily being subjected to will manifest in epidemic illness for all of us.  There are thousands of homeowners who have fled their homes like refugees, seeking new homes or places where the radiation levels are tolerable, but are finding that extremely difficult because of the multiple layers of wireless radio frequency radiation technology and its pollution.  It has saturated every environment on the planet.  Many people are too sick to defend themselves and the major portion of the public are unaware of this pollution let alone the possibility that it may be the cause of health issues. 
Your help will give a voice to millions of children and families.  We will speak out against the proliferation of massive levels of radio frequency radiation pollution so we can be restored the choice to live without illness. 
If you participate in this fight and/or send any amount of donation for our legal battle it will help.
 
THE IMPACT OF ACHIEVING OUR GOAL
A single well-fought case can make a huge difference in many people’s lives, exposing the lies the utility companies have told and validating the truth others have experienced across the State and Nation.  
The impact of this case is HUGE and will be felt on a personal, National, and global level, as everyone is impacted by radio frequency radiation pollution.
We have the right to a safe and hazard free environment.  
OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP
In addition to providing financila support, there are many other ways you can act now to help preserve a healthy legacy for our children and avoid one of illness and struggle for them to bear. 
Not to act shows compliance with the increasing amounts of radio frequency radiation pollution, raising the risk of illness for all of us. 
Awareness and activism are the only ways to force corporations to develop technology that will not harm us.   It is possible to create safe technology.  We have the brain power to do this.  We are accepting inferior products and technology because we don’t know any better.  How many of the ideas generated by physicists to help correct this problem are being explored by corporations?   How many of their ideas are being funded by our government?  ZERO. 
Corporations who have one goal, profit, are cheating us from solutions that would preserve our well-being.  These corporations have kidnapped our Government.  
What can you do to be active in the fight against this pollution?
1.  We can come together as one strong voice demanding an end to this corrupt abuse of power.  We can bring our voices to Washington demanding effective regulatory legistation before it is too late.
2.  We can write letters to our editors again and again asking why our corporations are not being compelled by our government to design safer technology for us. 
3.  I also encourage those who can hear and feel the symptoms to join me in this fight by filing the proper complaints with their respective Departments of Public Utilities, by signing petitions asking for updated research and lower acceptable RF levels.  THE FCC is woefully behind the times, has not proven that RF devices of the magnitude we are being forced to live with are safe, and has yet done nothing to help.
4.  We can demand all wireless or radio frequency transmitting devices be removed from our homes, such as Smart or wireless meters, and wireless modems. 
5.  We can speak at schools and churches about the impact of radio frequency radiation for children, and ask that these institutions set an example for the safety of our children and families by reducing wireless technology in schools and churches. 
These are just a few things we can do.

Joshua has continued to beat the odds as this disease has slowly taken away things we take for granted everyday. Joshua is confined to a wheelchair and his mobility has become more difficult and also painful.</p>
<p>     SMA causes scoliosis in most cases and Joshua is no exception. Joshua currently has a curve of 57 degrees and has begun to affect his lung function, ability to sit up straight and sleep at night. Joshua will be having surgery on August 30, 2012 at Vanderbilt Childrens Hospital to help correct this curve and insert rods. Following his surgery, Joshua will have to make almost exclusive use of his electric wheelchair.</p>
<p>     It is important to keep Joshua active not only at home but within the family and community. Staying active will help him recover from his surgery quicker and will also help him with the depression that follows most when they are restricted to their homes due to inability to get around. Your contribution will go a long way to not only heal Joshua physically, but also mentally and spiritually.</p>

<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>     Joshua is in need of a wheelchair ramp for a Minivan. These small portable ramps allow the electric chair to be easily driven up into a van with the seats taken out. The ramp is also lightweight and capable of folding into small, more manageable parts. The ability to fold the ramp and take it apart makes it light enough for my wife to carry and small enough to fit inside the vehicle.</p>
<p>     A second item Joshua is in need of is a Trailer Hitch Mounted Wheelchair carrier for the SUV we also drive. The minivan is a very old vehicle and is not reliable to get Joshua back and forth to his doctor appointments in Nashville. However, with the trailer hitch mounted carrier, we can continue to get Joshua to his appointments.</p>
<p>     The ramp for the minivan and the hitch carrier will cost at least $1,000 and that is not including the shipping, handling, and taxes. Any extra that we have after the ramp and carrier is purchased will go towards repairing a wheelchair ramp and deck to the house so Joshua can continue to come in and out of the house safely.</p>
<p>    With each donation up to $25 you will receive a signed thank you card. For donations between $26 and $35 you will receive a signed thank you card and signed picture of Joshua. For larger donations we have a few brand new Partylite items in addition to the signed thank you card and signed picture of Joshua. We have a Valentine Velvet Rose Gift Set, Gaia Tealight Lamp, Global Fusion Hurricane Lamp, and an Infinite Reflections Candle Holder.</p>
<p>     Should we fail to reach our goal, we will use whatever funds are donated and put it towards the purchase of the ramp and the trailer hitch mounted carrier.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
     Through the donations that you provide, children such as Joshua have an opportunity to experience the everyday freedoms that we so often take for granted. He can go outside and play, go to the park with his family or even just simply go shopping for groceries. He can feel included in the family unit and not feel left out all the time.</div>
<div>     Joshua never complains nor does he ask for much. I know he wants to be included each time we leave the house and we do the best we can to accomodate him and include him. However, without the ramp and the carrier this will become increasingly difficult. The one thing Joshua asked for took him many years to obtain due to the cost of the item and mounting medical bills. Joshua only wanted a bike. His legs do not allow him to ride a normal bicycle so Joshua had to have a recumbent hand bike. His story of receiving this bike was followed on local news and you can click on this link to follow the story. <a href=""http://www.newschannel5.com/story/9719427/11-year-old-boys-one-dream-comes-true"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.newschannel5.com/story/9719427/11-year-old-boys-one-dream-comes-true</a>
</div>
<div>     Your contribution will be far reaching with an impact that will be immediate and long lasting. From Joshua and all of us in his family, thank you for reading his story and thank you for donating from the bottom of our hearts.</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>     If you're unable to make a financial contribution then all we ask is for you to please place Joshua and all other children stricken with a disease on your praryer list. The value of prayer can never have a monetary unit placed upon it. Also, please visit <a href=""http://www.fsma.org/FSMACommunity/UnderstandingSMA/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.fsma.org/FSMACommunity/UnderstandingSMA/</a> and read about SMA (spinal muscular atrophy).</p>
<p>     Please also share this story with as many people as possible using Indiegogo share tools! As each share will certainly get a prayer and bring awareness to SMA!</p>

The superfruit with super powers.  Packed with 90 different healing compounds, it’s your drinkable beauty boost. Does your smart phone greet you first thing in the morning?  Do you fall asleep on your laptop at night? Is your dry, lifeless skin begging for a break from your hectic, connected life?What if screen time could become green time? What if there was a drink that could harness the power of nature to fix all of this without having to give up any of that? What if there was a functional water that could help reduce the damaging effects of stress, blue light and sunlight?   A beauty and wellness beverage that could help protect your eyes, your skin and so much more?Wouldn’t you drink to that? Don't just take our words for it. Hear what others think!GacLife has been featured in:***Here are what real users think about our drinks:“I’m in heaven! I could immediately tell that GacLife isn’t filled with tons of sugars and fake ingredients like other juices brands are….” - Tory J., 29 ***“Even though it’s completely organic and natural, there is a delicate sweetness to the water that makes it tasteful. It’s not too raw, or too artificial. A happy medium.” - Jessica C., 31 ***“A lot of ‘hangover remedy’ juices actually end up giving me a worse headache because of all the sugar and fake ingredients. This was one of the only juices I could drink after a night out and actually feel better. I felt more refreshed and lighter.” - Oliver B, 27 ***“When I am tired of my morning coffee routine and looking for a little pick up, the GacLife water is that for me. Simple taste that I know isn’t dehydrating me like coffee but giving me the pick me up I need.” - Jordan A., 26 The superfruit with the super weird name, gấc (Momordica cochinchinensis) is a rare fruit found only in Southeast Asia.For thousands of years, the people of Southeast Asia have cherished this ""fruit from heaven"" for good reason. This prickly orange powerhouse is a treasure trove of nutrients and antioxidants.And we bet you’ve never heard of it. Gac fruit has been Asia’s best-kept health and beauty secret for centuries. When mixed into a liquid form, gac is like a fountain of youth in your water bottle.Named after the superfruit, gấc is drinkable beauty sent straight from heaven. But don’t take our word for it. The science is real.Here’s what science geeks love about gấc. A healthy diet, rich in antioxidants including carotenoids, could serve as the best preventive strategy against skin aging.Gac friut contains more antioxidants, including Vitamins A,C, E, and flavonoids, polyphenols than you’ll find in other fruits and vegetables.  But gac’s biggest beauty boost comes from its mega high concentration of carotenoids that your body can actually absorb. It contains high levels of α-carotene, β-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin and lycopene.The ""low sugar"" box is also checked. Gac is mild tasting, similar to avocados with cucumber-like aroma. It contains very little sugar  – only 7g sugar/100g fresh gac aril.   Gac fruit contains the highest concentration of carotenoids, one of the world’s most potent antioxidants, than you’ll find anywhere else.Carotenoids are cool.  But the key to absorbing them is their bioavailability (amount that your body actually digests and absorbs). And gac’s natural carotenoids got that. Not only are the carotenoids available, they’re bioavailable. Meaning your body can use and absorb them.  Our founder, Yin Zou discovered the magic of gac fruit firsthand on a business trip to Vietnam. Amazed by gac’s refreshingly mild taste and health benefits, Yin noticed improvements in her skin, vision and overall energy level by making gac a daily staple in her diet. Yin was inspired to do more research and create a functional water to share with the world. Based on extensive scientific research, Yin and her team took one of the world’s rarest superfruits and bottled it for maximum beauty benefits.  Now you can choose from five, lip-smacking tropical fruity flavors mixed with either sparkling or still water. Pineapple, peach, passionfruit, lemon or mango. Yum.  How can a functional water that tastes so light and refreshing work so hard to keep you healthy, hydrated and protected? Glad you asked.  Here’s what’s in it: (nutrition slightly varies by all-natural fruit juice in each flavor) You may ask. How much is 20mg? What does it mean? Here is roughly what you’ll need to eat to obtain 20mg of carotenoids.  Gấc’s beauty is more than just skin deep. It’s your beverage friend with benefits. Our drinks offer you antioxidants, including Carotenoids (lycopene, beta-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin), Vitamins A, C, E, and other healing compounds naturally occur in gac. 
Vitamins A,C, E & carotenoids can rejuvenate collagen, which keeps your skin looking firm and young.
Lutein, Zeaxanthin can protect your eyes against oxidative damage from visible blue light and UVs and improve hand-eye coordination. 
Lycopene can reduce oxidative DNA damage and cardiovascular risk during physical exercises. 
Gấc is antioxidant and pro beauty. Now that’s a potent elixir.   Here’s what gấc doesn’t contain.  No added sugars, no preservatives, and none of the yucky chemicals found in most functional water drinks, fruit juices and sodas that claim to be healthy.Our ingredients are simple: water or carbonated water & fruit juices (not from concentrate). Each 12oz bottle contains only 0 ~ 3g sugar – all from 100% natural fruit juice.   Stunning on the outside.  Smart on the inside. Just like your college crush. Made of 100% recyclable aluminum, our made-in-USA bottles are reusable and Mother Earth approved.  Hey, we know you’re not going to give up your devices or your busy lifestyle.  You work hard. Isn’t it time for a cool, new, functional wellness water that works as hard as you do?So you keep doing you.  Just add gấc into the mix and let your beauty flag fly. Here’s what we’ll do with your dollars when you preorder gấc.We’re all about sustainable bottling and creating a product that’s earth friendly. If you join our crowd funding effort, you’ll help us purchase the special tools we need to package our drinks in 100% recyclable, reusable aluminum bottles here in Los Angeles, CA at our bottler Seven Up’s facility.C’mon, let’s make funding fun.  Help us bring this rare superfruit drinkable skincare to the U.S. and beyond in the most sustainable packaging!On behalf of the GacLife crew, thank you for your support! Meet Team GacLife

<p>86 year old Australian aged pensioner, Dietrich Durdis travelled to Bali, Indonesia in early August, shortly thereafter he fell and broke his hip. Dietrich is without travel insurance, and due to his injury was unable to return on his booked flight back to Australia, so has spent the last 9 weeks in traction at Sanglah Hospital in Bali. Sanglah Medical Practitioners have advised that Dietrich requires surgery and have quoted approximately $15000 AUD to undertake the operation. Dietrich is extremely hesitant to undergo the surgery in Indonesia and would rather receive medical treatment in Australia. Without travel insurance Dietrich's options to return to Australia for medical treatment are extremely limited. Due to his injuries, Dietrich is required to travel on a stretcher and with a medical escort. The only airline that is able to accommodate such a requirement from Bali, Indonesia, to Darwin, Australia (one way) is Silk airlines, their quote of $30000 AUD is considerably less that the quote received from Flight Care International (Australia) which came in at $39773.93 AUD (though would require travel from Australia to Indonesia return). The Australian Embassy is able to assist with the making of arrangements and have been very helpful, though unfortunately are unable to assist financially. Sanglah Hospital are charging $100 AUD per day, and to date, directly related expenses have reached over $8000 AUD (which has been met by friends and family within the community). Dietrich is also being fined daily by the Indonesian Government for overstaying his Visa due to not being able afford appropriate travel and leave Indonesia. During the last 9 weeks, Dietrich's health has deteriorated and he has suffered significant weight loss.</p>
<p>My name is Darlene Devery, I am a family friend of Dietrich. I am a long term resident of Darwin and an active member of my community. I hold very grave concerns for Dietrich's health and feel that if Dietrich is not financially assisted to return to Australia for medical treatment it may ultimately result in his demise. My goal is to assist Dietrich to return to Australia in any way that I possibly can. Myself and other members of the Darwin (and indeed nationally throughout Australia) community have banded together and created a group page on Facebook where our progress, ideas and support are being posted, you can find this page at <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/groups/BringDietrichHome"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.facebook.com/groups/BringDietrichHome</a><br/></p>
<p>We believe that if we can raise enough community awareness about Dietrich's plight and disastrous circumstances we will reach our fundraising goal of $55000 AUD. Social networking is a fabulous tool and can really be used to benefit this gentleman to return home to Australia to undergo medical treatment and regain his health. If the fundraising goal of $55000 is reached, these funds will be used directly to pay hospital expenses, fines in relation to Dietrich's overstay of his visa in Indonesia and retrieval from Bali returning him home to Darwin and Australian medical treatment. If the goal of $50000 is not reached, we will continue to fundraise until we can afford to get Dietrich home to Australia.<br/></p>
<p>With Australian 'Schoolies Week' fast approaching us, this campaign can also be utilised as a community education tool, to ensure that youths and their parents who may be travelling abroad to celebrate 'Schoolies Week' take out appropriate travel / health insurance as in Dietrich's circumstances, one never knows when something as disastrous as this can happen to an individual whilst abroad.</p>
<p>Whilst I understand that not everyone can afford to donate financially to the 'Bring Dietrich Home to Australia' Campaign there are many other ways that you can contribute to the cause. You can share posts from our Facebook page to raise community awareness, you could encourage your friends to do the same. Our campaign also relies heavily on community support and anything else you can do to help spread our message.</p>
<p>So far: Contacts in Bali will be visiting Dietrich whilst he is in hospital; Darwin community members who are travelling to Bali in the near future have committed to taking required items to Dietrich; we have been interviewed by the Northern Territory News (Darwin) and they have committed to featuring an article to raise awareness of our campaign. We are also contacting local government members and other community groups and or organisations to ascertain what assistance they may provide.</p>

<br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","86 year old Australian aged pensioner, Dietrich Durdis travelled to Bali, Indonesia in early August, shortly thereafter he fell and broke his hip. Dietrich is without travel insurance, and due to his injury was unable to return on his booked flight back to Australia, so has spent the last 9 weeks in traction at Sanglah Hospital in Bali. Sanglah Medical Practitioners have advised that Dietrich requires surgery and have quoted approximately $15000 AUD to undertake the operation. Dietrich is extremely hesitant to undergo the surgery in Indonesia and would rather receive medical treatment in Australia. Without travel insurance Dietrich's options to return to Australia for medical treatment are extremely limited. Due to his injuries, Dietrich is required to travel on a stretcher and with a medical escort. The only airline that is able to accommodate such a requirement from Bali, Indonesia, to Darwin, Australia (one way) is Silk airlines, their quote of $30000 AUD is considerably less that the quote received from Flight Care International (Australia) which came in at $39773.93 AUD (though would require travel from Australia to Indonesia return). The Australian Embassy is able to assist with the making of arrangements and have been very helpful, though unfortunately are unable to assist financially. Sanglah Hospital are charging $100 AUD per day, and to date, directly related expenses have reached over $8000 AUD (which has been met by friends and family within the community). Dietrich is also being fined daily by the Indonesian Government for overstaying his Visa due to not being able afford appropriate travel and leave Indonesia. During the last 9 weeks, Dietrich's health has deteriorated and he has suffered significant weight loss.
My name is Darlene Devery, I am a family friend of Dietrich. I am a long term resident of Darwin and an active member of my community. I hold very grave concerns for Dietrich's health and feel that if Dietrich is not financially assisted to return to Australia for medical treatment it may ultimately result in his demise. My goal is to assist Dietrich to return to Australia in any way that I possibly can. Myself and other members of the Darwin (and indeed nationally throughout Australia) community have banded together and created a group page on Facebook where our progress, ideas and support are being posted, you can find this page at www.facebook.com/groups/BringDietrichHome

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Please allow me to introduce myself and explain my campaign and why it is so important to me. <br/><br/>My name is Tracy Wilder-Garmon. In July of 1986, while pregnant with my first child, my mother Anne Wilder was diagnosed with breast cancer. In September of '86, she underwent a double mastectomy and a lymphectomy. At that time, her oncologist declared her 'cancer free' and sent her on her way. Fast forward to Christmas Eve, 1987; while showering that night, my mother felt a hard mass on her breast bone. She didn't tell our family until after the holidays and after her follow-up with her oncologist. Sadly, the breast cancer had returned. When I got the news, I was incredulous! I did not understand how a woman with no breast, no breast tissue and no lymph nodes could have breast cancer again. It was explained to us that a rogue cell had escaped the surgery and that my mom was no in the fight of her life. The mass was removed and my mother began a regimen of chemo and radiation. She did it with bravery and a sense of humor. She kept <em>our</em><span style=""font-style: normal;""> spirits up with her grace and courage. In the midst of her treatments and two months after finding out I was expecting my second child, my daddy succumbed to a massive heart attack. It punched a hole in our world...in our hearts and I could see in my mom's eyes that she was losing her will to fight. She continued her treatments, but she had no fight left in her. Even the birth of a second grandbaby was not enough to bring the life back in her eyes and on March 21, 1991, after an almost five year battle with breast cancer, my mom passed away. Not a day goes by that I don't miss my mom and wish she had won her battle. She missed out on so much. The birth of a third grandbaby. All the joys that come along with being 'Grandma'. Watching those gBabies grow up and have babies of their own. She would be overjoyed to spoil her two GREAT granddaughters!<br/><br/>That is what brings me here to Indiegogo and my campaign to 'Kick Cancer's Ass!'. Since October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, I felt like this would be a good time to launch my campaign and let people know about the project I have planned for this month. One of my mother's many talents was sewing and she passed that talent and love on to me. I know own my own sewing and embroidery company. During the month of October, I will be selling quilt panels and when I have finished the quilt, there will (hopefully) be at least 100 squares honoring and/or memorializing loved ones who are battling, have battled and won their fight with cancer or battled and sadly lost their courageous battle. </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><span style=""font-style: normal;"">The quilt panels are $25.00 each. Each panel will be approximately 7” x 7” and I will monogram each panel that is sold. For example, I will buy a panel that says 'In Memory Of Anne Wilder'. You can buy more than one panel and each honoree can have more than one panel. Every single person reading this has been touched by cancer in some way. It is a cruel and relentless disease when left untreated. Even those this is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, you can honor anyone with any kind of cancer. </span></p>

<h3>After successful funding we will start building immediately. It will be a fascinating project developing anywhere in the world where people need it most.  </h3>
<h3>We estimate two years of pre-planning, production and constructing on site.

<h2>My Story</h2>
<p>Several years ago, my life partner was diagnosed with a rare genetic disease called Porphyria and it had proven to be a struggle as many doctors had not had any experience. She can't be exposed to the sun for long, or she develops 3rd degree burns on her limbs that require constant attention.</p>
<p><br/>These past few years we have adjusted and learned how to deal and adapt to this, after several hospital stays and constant fear that my partner would lose her life.</p>
<p>I couldn't be more proud of her now, overcoming such a painful and horrible disease and learning to live day by day.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A couple of months ago, I felt lumps on my breast and assumed it was fibercists sprouting up again. I was <strong>wrong</strong>.</p>
I have been diagnosed with Stage 3A Breast Cancer and now I have to adjust to losing my hair, my breasts and everything I know.</div>
<p>I'm a musician, I'm a mother, I'm a life parnter, I'm a Buddhist, I'm a hippie... and soon, I hope to be a breast cancer survivor.</p>
<div> </div>
<div>I have a team of doctors at UTMB Health Breast Center that working as diligently as they can to stop this cancer before it claims my life.</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>What We Can Expect</h2>
<p>After many, many, many tests and doctor's appointments, we have determined the best course of action, unfortunately it requires nearly every treatment option known to breast cancer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuous Doctor's Appointments</li>
<li>MRI</li>
<li>PET Scan</li>
<li>ECHO Scan</li>
<li>Blood Work</li>
<li>Biopsies</li>
</ul><p>And this is all BEFORE actual treatment, and my medical bills have already staggered pretty high.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The doctors want to pursue an aggressive treatment, because my cells were considered a grade 3.... which means they are severely cancerous and aggressive. They have a 1 year plan to hopefully turn me into a breast cancer survivor.</p>
<p><strong>The treatment includes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A double mastectomy</li>
<li>Breast reconstruction</li>
<li>Chemotherapy</li>
<li>Radiation</li>
<li>HER2 Protein Therapy</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong>Recovery aids include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Heavy duty Aair sanitizers</li>
<li>Wigs</li>
<li>Probably much more I haven't thought of</li>
</ul><p>We estimate these treatments to total over $10,000 (not including recovery aids) if not more in the next year. We do not expect to reach our full goal of course, but we hope to make at least enough to not cost our home and well-being in exchange for my life.</p></div>","My Story

I have a team of doctors at UTMB Health Breast Center that working as diligently as they can to stop this cancer before it claims my life.
 
What We Can Expect
After many, many, many tests and doctor's appointments, we have determined the best course of action, unfortunately it requires nearly every treatment option known to breast cancer.

Continuous Doctor's Appointments
MRI
PET Scan
ECHO Scan
Blood Work
Biopsies
And this is all BEFORE actual treatment, and my medical bills have already staggered pretty high.
 
The doctors want to pursue an aggressive treatment, because my cells were considered a grade 3.... which means they are severely cancerous and aggressive. They have a 1 year plan to hopefully turn me into a breast cancer survivor.
The treatment includes:

A double mastectomy
Breast reconstruction
Chemotherapy
Radiation
HER2 Protein Therapy
 
Recovery aids include:

Heavy duty Aair sanitizers
Wigs
Probably much more I haven't thought of
We estimate these treatments to total over $10,000 (not including recovery aids) if not more in the next year. We do not expect to reach our full goal of course, but we hope to make at least enough to not cost our home and well-being in exchange for my life.",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<h3>What is the Expert Marksman System?</h3>
<p>I came up with the idea for the EM system after supervising Small Arms Instructors (SAIs) for the US Coast Guard.  We would spend hours of instructor time and hundreds of bullets teaching a new shooter basic marksmanship to the point where they could qualify to carry a weapon.  The EM system was developed for military/police marksmanship training but is avalible for anyone wanting to improve their marksmanship skills.</p>
<p>The EM system is based on motion sensors like those found in your smartphone and most gaming systems.  These measure acceleration and rotation of the firearm during the trigger pull to display any mistakes the shooter makes while shooting.  By providing immediate feedback to the shooter, they can more quickly train themselves to perform a smooth trigger pull.  The EM system also works during live fire training to detect anticipation motion before firing!  </p>
<p>For experienced shooters, the EM system provides a great dry-fire warm-up to any range day and lets you diagnose shooting problems by seeing the detailed motion of your trigger pull like it has never been seen before.  The result is better shooting with fewer bullets!  The EM system is accurate to under .5 inches at 25 yards and under 2 inches at 100 yards.</p>
<p>The EM system works with a hand held or laptop device via a Bluetooth 4.0 connection available on all new iPhones and iPads and most Android phones and tablets.  The EM system can also interface with a 4.0 compatible windows device or windows based laptop via a USB dongle adaptor.  </p>
<p>The EM system can be integrated into the firearm in multiple ways but we have settled on the two best approaches.  The EM system can be attached to the rail mount system on most modern firearms for training and removed just as easily and is therefor the simplest approach that we will be launching with.  For firearms without a rail system, we can integrate the EM system into a magazine.  The large number of magazines that are currently used means that we will be rolling these devices out separately in the future.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Benefits of the EM system</h3>
<p>The EM system include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced number of bullets required to initially training and maintain marksmanship competency.</li>
<li>Never before seen insight into what a student's trigger pull looks like and direct feedback on any errors.</li>
<li>Reduced workload for Small Arms Instructors to maintain firearms qualifications.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Project Status</h3>
<p>The EM system has been under development for over three years and is ready for our first production run!  Some of the tasks completed are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fundamental physics is well understood and validated with experiments</li>
<li>A proof of concept device was fabricated and used to test the system and user interface.</li>
<li>A set of rail mount production prototypes were designed and fabricated for wireless units.</li>
<li>The basic iOS code has been developed.</li>
<li>A Li-Ion battery was found that can supply over 5 hours of continuous operation between charges.</li>
<li>The production prototypes have been extensively live fire tested.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Race to Product Release!</h3>
<p>We are attempting to finish the last few development tasks and go to production to launch the EM system at several Law Enforcement trade shows this fall with the big launch at the 2014 SHOT SHOW in Vegas!  This is where you can help.  The money raised in this project will be used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial Production run of the EM system.  We are looking at at least 1000 units with more if needed.</li>
<li>Complete the iOS user interface.  The iPhone/iPad software works but the user interface is a little clunky.  A big task will be to streamline the interface so that the system is easy and intuitive to use.</li>
<li>Develop Java based software for Android based systems.  We don't want to limit this to the Apple only crowd!</li>
<li>Trade shows here we come!</li>

I know that Everyone has rough patches, Everyone has their own problems and no matter how bad Someone does have it, there is ALWAYS someone who has it worse, but if you have a few minutes to read our Families story and possibly help in anyway you can it would be greatly appreciated. I will tell the story of our Family and my Mom here, but I also tell it in the video as well, if you would rather watch than read. (Sorry its quite the long read). <b>The reason we are needing to reach out is my Mom has Stage 3 Ovarian Cancer which has recently spread to her Brain, The costs of Treatments, Medications, and other Expenses like Gas to and from her Oncologist and Specialists that are a 5 to 6 hour round trip several times a week all adds up very fast, plus we have had several other issues that have come up recently and were barley keeping afloat as it is. My Dad and I are also both disabled so the little income we do get is gone before we get it, with the costs of all of our Medical Bills, Medications, etc. were barley staying a float. Also after a Recent storm our bathroom ceiling fell in &amp; revealed not only do we have to fix the ceiling, but also there is Black Mold to deal with as well. If you have the time, I will tell our full story below. If you can share this link it would be much appreciated, <a href=""http://www.4Lynnette.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.4Lynnette.com</a>.</b><br/></p><p>My name is Richard, most people call me Rich. I would like the take the time to tell the story of our Family but most of all about my Wonderful Mom. My Mom Lynnette has had it particularly hard from a very young age, at the age of 9 she was first diagnosed with Kidney Disease and between the ages of 9 and 14 she spent more time in the hospital then at home. In 1978 she required a Kidney Transplant, the Doctors thought it would be a pretty easy match as my Mom is a Twin, but unfortunately in 1982 the Kidney started to reject and she required a 2nd transplant, she received a Kidney from her Brother Rick (which I was named after) and after that transplant all looked well! Except for the fact that she was told her body would not take well to a pregnancy, so when my parents found out they were pregnant the Doctors immediately told her to have a abortion. When my Mom found out that I would have a 90+% survival rate she refused the abortion.........even though SHE only had a 15% survival rate, that is just the type of loving and selfless person my Mother is! Although it was not a perfect pregnancy, she pushed through it, giving birth to me in 1984. Even though her new Kidney was not rejecting, it didn't mean her life was easy. She basically has NO Immune System and was constantly battling sickness, and actually had several near fatal incidents.</p><p>Although her life was hard and she had to fight daily, she still did not show signs of weakness and always stayed strong for her Family, always putting us first. She worked a Full Time job and was our Families only income after 1989, because my Dad was in a horrible accident. While riding his bicycle to work, a car ran a red light and hit my Dad, breaking his Back, Neck, several other bones and also leaving him with a Closed Head Injury, after half a dozen surgeries my Dad was still disabled and unable to work. My Mom still always made sure he was taken care of after every surgery, even after working a 10 hour job. She always stayed strong and always showed us love and care!</p><p>In early 2000s my Mom was in a pretty bad car accident which left her with a lot of added problems she didn't deserve like back and knee problems, she was a Pharmacy Tech so her job required her to be on her feet for 8-10 hours everyday and it just got to a point where the pain was to much for her and she had to stop working. She ended up having a Knee Replacement and several procedures to try and help her back with little to no relief. She still put a smile on her face not to show the pain she was in on a daily basis.</p><p>Then on July 30th, 2005 I was in a life changing motorcycle accident. I was cut off on the expressway, I had to slam my brakes on and unfortunately in doing so, the brakes locked up and I ended up going over the windshield of my motorcycle at 80MPH. I tumbled, slide, bounced and flew nearly a football field in length, leaving over 50% of my body burned from road rash. Treating me as a full burn victim, I was hospitalized for weeks and my Mom &amp; Dad were there by my side as often and as much as they could be, even though they were going through their own pain, they wanted to be there for me! Even after leaving the hospital I had to be home cared for nearly a year after the accident and my Mom volunteered to be my at home nurse and change my bandages, clean me, give me my medications and anything that needed to be done to someone bed ridden, and she never once complained, and ALWAYS smiling, loving and caring. Even though she HAD to be in so much pain herself, she never ever made me feel like a burden, that's just the kind-hearted wonderful person she is! I am now disabled with problems with my Back, Hip,<b> </b>Both Knees, and Permanent Nerve Damage to most of the left side of my Body, she was always there for me. AND I love her SO MUCH for that!</p><p>Our Extended Family always called us the THREE MUSKETEERS! The 3 of us all Disabled, but we all depended and counted on each other. All three of us have been through so much, But even though we have been through so much we always liked to try and do for others. My Dad helps every single year a Local Organization put on a Motorcycle Rally and together they help raise nearly $80,000 every year for Hospice. My Mom was always giving back by donating to the food drive and clothing donations, she hated seeing things that COULD be used to benefit someone just siting in a closet so why not donate them to someone who could use them! And I ran a small Organization called Kids Get Diggin' and I helped raise Cash Donations and Equipment Donations to help less fortunate children and Families get Metal Detecting Equipment to help get them Active and spend time with their Families but also find Historical Artifacts that helps them learn American History! So I feel like our Family should have enough Karma to be able to relax and live a nice normal life, right? Unfortunately Not!</p><p>In December 2012 my Mom was Diagnosed with Stage 3 Ovarian Cancer, at first the doctors had mixed feelings about what diagnosis it was because of my Moms previous health issues and Kidney Transplants, etc. They first thought it was Stomach Cancer, either-way our Family was devastated to hear that my Mom was diagnosed with any type of Cancer. After the Diagnosis was firmly Ovarian Cancer her Oncologist worked with her Kidney Doctors to work out a plan to rid my Mom of this horrible disease! They treated her with Khemo, and everything looked to be going the right way, the Tumors were shrinking, the treatments were working. The Doctor felt comfortable enough to perform surgery and remove what needed to be removed. Again after the surgery she continued with her Khemo and everything was looking good. A year has past by now and after months and months of her numbers going in the RIGHT directions, Doctors started seeing things out of the ordinary, just to make sure everything was still on track the Doctors decided to do a complete check up on everything.</p><p>The day is July 31st, 9 years to the day since being in my Motorcycle accident. The day is particularly rough on me, but July 31st, 2014 was completely different, July 31st, 2014 is the day we found out that not only does my Mom have Stage 3 Ovarian Cancer......my Mom has Brain Cancer. My Mom has Brain Cancer, just take a second and say those words out loud. The words that can bring a grown man to his knees in tears. I was in shock at first, not wanting to hear it or believe it, maybe it is just a nightmare and I will wake up any minute now. But unfortunately I was not and am not dreaming. My Mom and Dad are literally my best friends, and they have been amazingly strong throughout this whole process, they have kept me stable over the years but July 31, 2014 was a day I cried the day away.</p><p>After finding out my Moms Cancer has spread to her Brain, her Doctors had to work on a strategy on her next steps and it all happens very fast, she found out she had Brain Cancer on July 31st, she met with her Neurologist on August 4th and her Procedure was scheduled for August 19th. After running several tests to assess the situation, they found that she had 6 masses that all varied in sizes from barely visible all the way to 4-5mm. Leading up to the Procedure I could tell my Mom was getting very nervous (with good reason), and I felt so useless with not being able to do nothing but comfort her. The Procedure she had done was called a 'Gamma Knife' and although they do not actually cut anything, the Procedure is still very uncomfortable, they have to put this big rigid, metal framing around her head and have to screw it into her skull so it does not move around, they then place her into a machine where she is unable to move what so ever for a couple hours as they precisely place Radiation Beams in the specific spots in her head where the masses are located.</p><p>After going through all that she still could get side effects from the procedure that could occur hours or even days after the procedure! So she was scared and uneasy that whole night. Her head was hurting all that night and her eyes actually swelled up so much she could barely even see out of them! I couldn't even imagine what my Mom has had to go through over these past 2 years but the past 2 years don't even come close to the amount of stress, scared and unknowing look that I seen in my Moms eyes over the past Month.</p><p>The unfortunate thing is after going though all that, the Procedure did not go as well as the Doctors had hoped for, and although nothing went ""wrong"", it did not go ""well"" either, so they had to schedule ANOTHER Gamma Knife Procedure for September 3rd, and this time with my Mom knowing what she was going to have to go through, she was even MORE stress and uneasy! After finishing the 2nd Gamma Knife Procedure the Doctors seemed like the procedure went the way they wanted it to, but unfortunately they will not know if it was a partial or complete success for what could be up to two MONTHS. If after the 2 months are up and the Doctors do not see what they are wanting to see, her other options are nothing the Doctors nor my Mom are wanting, with one of the options being ""Experimental"" means that if my Mom has to go that route that her Insurance would not cover it.</p><p>I am sorry for the long message, but if you made it this far the story must have touched your heart, so I hope that you can take the time to say a prayer, if you dont pray just keep her in your thoughts. Also if you can pass this Campaign along, that also would be greatly appreciated. If you are able to donate even just a little it would mean a lot to us, every little bit help! If you make a donation and would like to show your support even more by wearing a support bracelet just let me know and I will have one in the mail ASAP for you to show your support that way too! Thanks again for taking the time to read our story, <br/></p><p><br/></p></div>","Hello and Thank You for taking the time to look at this Campaign.

When my Mom found out that I would have a 90+% survival rate she refused the abortion.........even though SHE only had a 15% survival rate, that is just the type of loving and selfless person my Mother is! Although it was not a perfect pregnancy, she pushed through it, giving birth to me in 1984. Even though her new Kidney was not rejecting, it didn't mean her life was easy. She basically has NO Immune System and was constantly battling sickness, and actually had several near fatal incidents.Although her life was hard and she had to fight daily, she still did not show signs of weakness and always stayed strong for her Family, always putting us first. She worked a Full Time job and was our Families only income after 1989, because my Dad was in a horrible accident. While riding his bicycle to work, a car ran a red light and hit my Dad, breaking his Back, Neck, several other bones and also leaving him with a Closed Head Injury, after half a dozen surgeries my Dad was still disabled and unable to work. My Mom still always made sure he was taken care of after every surgery, even after working a 10 hour job. She always stayed strong and always showed us love and care!In early 2000s my Mom was in a pretty bad car accident which left her with a lot of added problems she didn't deserve like back and knee problems, she was a Pharmacy Tech so her job required her to be on her feet for 8-10 hours everyday and it just got to a point where the pain was to much for her and she had to stop working. She ended up having a Knee Replacement and several procedures to try and help her back with little to no relief. She still put a smile on her face not to show the pain she was in on a daily basis.Then on July 30th, 2005 I was in a life changing motorcycle accident. I was cut off on the expressway, I had to slam my brakes on and unfortunately in doing so, the brakes locked up and I ended up going over the windshield of my motorcycle at 80MPH. I tumbled, slide, bounced and flew nearly a football field in length, leaving over 50% of my body burned from road rash. Treating me as a full burn victim, I was hospitalized for weeks and my Mom & Dad were there by my side as often and as much as they could be, even though they were going through their own pain, they wanted to be there for me! Even after leaving the hospital I had to be home cared for nearly a year after the accident and my Mom volunteered to be my at home nurse and change my bandages, clean me, give me my medications and anything that needed to be done to someone bed ridden, and she never once complained, and ALWAYS smiling, loving and caring. Even though she HAD to be in so much pain herself, she never ever made me feel like a burden, that's just the kind-hearted wonderful person she is! I am now disabled with problems with my Back, Hip, Both Knees, and Permanent Nerve Damage to most of the left side of my Body, she was always there for me. AND I love her SO MUCH for that!Our Extended Family always called us the THREE MUSKETEERS! The 3 of us all Disabled, but we all depended and counted on each other. All three of us have been through so much, But even though we have been through so much we always liked to try and do for others. My Dad helps every single year a Local Organization put on a Motorcycle Rally and together they help raise nearly $80,000 every year for Hospice. My Mom was always giving back by donating to the food drive and clothing donations, she hated seeing things that COULD be used to benefit someone just siting in a closet so why not donate them to someone who could use them! And I ran a small Organization called Kids Get Diggin' and I helped raise Cash Donations and Equipment Donations to help less fortunate children and Families get Metal Detecting Equipment to help get them Active and spend time with their Families but also find Historical Artifacts that helps them learn American History! So I feel like our Family should have enough Karma to be able to relax and live a nice normal life, right? Unfortunately Not!In December 2012 my Mom was Diagnosed with Stage 3 Ovarian Cancer, at first the doctors had mixed feelings about what diagnosis it was because of my Moms previous health issues and Kidney Transplants, etc. They first thought it was Stomach Cancer, either-way our Family was devastated to hear that my Mom was diagnosed with any type of Cancer. After the Diagnosis was firmly Ovarian Cancer her Oncologist worked with her Kidney Doctors to work out a plan to rid my Mom of this horrible disease! They treated her with Khemo, and everything looked to be going the right way, the Tumors were shrinking, the treatments were working. The Doctor felt comfortable enough to perform surgery and remove what needed to be removed. Again after the surgery she continued with her Khemo and everything was looking good. A year has past by now and after months and months of her numbers going in the RIGHT directions, Doctors started seeing things out of the ordinary, just to make sure everything was still on track the Doctors decided to do a complete check up on everything.The day is July 31st, 9 years to the day since being in my Motorcycle accident. The day is particularly rough on me, but July 31st, 2014 was completely different, July 31st, 2014 is the day we found out that not only does my Mom have Stage 3 Ovarian Cancer......my Mom has Brain Cancer. My Mom has Brain Cancer, just take a second and say those words out loud. The words that can bring a grown man to his knees in tears. I was in shock at first, not wanting to hear it or believe it, maybe it is just a nightmare and I will wake up any minute now. But unfortunately I was not and am not dreaming. My Mom and Dad are literally my best friends, and they have been amazingly strong throughout this whole process, they have kept me stable over the years but July 31, 2014 was a day I cried the day away.After finding out my Moms Cancer has spread to her Brain, her Doctors had to work on a strategy on her next steps and it all happens very fast, she found out she had Brain Cancer on July 31st, she met with her Neurologist on August 4th and her Procedure was scheduled for August 19th. After running several tests to assess the situation, they found that she had 6 masses that all varied in sizes from barely visible all the way to 4-5mm. Leading up to the Procedure I could tell my Mom was getting very nervous (with good reason), and I felt so useless with not being able to do nothing but comfort her. The Procedure she had done was called a 'Gamma Knife' and although they do not actually cut anything, the Procedure is still very uncomfortable, they have to put this big rigid, metal framing around her head and have to screw it into her skull so it does not move around, they then place her into a machine where she is unable to move what so ever for a couple hours as they precisely place Radiation Beams in the specific spots in her head where the masses are located.After going through all that she still could get side effects from the procedure that could occur hours or even days after the procedure! So she was scared and uneasy that whole night. Her head was hurting all that night and her eyes actually swelled up so much she could barely even see out of them! I couldn't even imagine what my Mom has had to go through over these past 2 years but the past 2 years don't even come close to the amount of stress, scared and unknowing look that I seen in my Moms eyes over the past Month.The unfortunate thing is after going though all that, the Procedure did not go as well as the Doctors had hoped for, and although nothing went ""wrong"", it did not go ""well"" either, so they had to schedule ANOTHER Gamma Knife Procedure for September 3rd, and this time with my Mom knowing what she was going to have to go through, she was even MORE stress and uneasy! After finishing the 2nd Gamma Knife Procedure the Doctors seemed like the procedure went the way they wanted it to, but unfortunately they will not know if it was a partial or complete success for what could be up to two MONTHS. If after the 2 months are up and the Doctors do not see what they are wanting to see, her other options are nothing the Doctors nor my Mom are wanting, with one of the options being ""Experimental"" means that if my Mom has to go that route that her Insurance would not cover it.I am sorry for the long message, but if you made it this far the story must have touched your heart, so I hope that you can take the time to say a prayer, if you dont pray just keep her in your thoughts. Also if you can pass this Campaign along, that also would be greatly appreciated. If you are able to donate even just a little it would mean a lot to us, every little bit help! If you make a donation and would like to show your support even more by wearing a support bracelet just let me know and I will have one in the mail ASAP for you to show your support that way too!

Gululu is a sleek design bottle combined with a modern-day Tamagotchi-like smart toy to encourage both kids and adults to keep hydrated and stay informed through a cloud-based App. Animated pets come to life in the Gululu Universe as you drink more water, reaching new levels and revealing new powers. Advanced sensors in the hardware, together with reward-based game design and social software, let you care for their virtual pet and make new friends. Automatic software update continues to push add-on digital content and makes the Gululu Universe ever expanding to enable a healthy habit.












Share our Indiegogo page and get our special gifts: Gululu coloring pages! In order to share and get your free coloring pages, follow the steps below and click on the buttons









Do you know how much water is enough for your kids? Gululu personalizes and sets goals based on your child’s age, weight, and location. Water intake data is automatically synced to the cloud through WiFi, letting you easily track your child’s water intake through the app.



Water is tasteless, so kids need motivation to drink enough water! As your child drinks more water, the virtual pet in the bottle grows, collects treasures, and explores an underwater world of adventure called the ""Gululu Universe.""



 “Shake! Shake! – Be my friend!”

Shake two nearby Gululu bottles to make friends, then watch the pets play together. Kids can compare their hydration progress and habit scores, and parents can get a glimpse of their children's social circle.






Gululu is equipped with multiple embedded sensors that work together to not only measure water intake, but also to detect whether your child is drinking water, or pouring it out. The pets thrive in and explore the Gululu Universe as your child drinks more water. 


 “Kids will never get bored”
As our team of developers iterates the game to include more treasures, levels, characters and perhaps surprises, the bottle automatically updates, keeping your child engaged in fresh and exciting new challenges.











We carefully designed our bottle for the care-free little ones.  We took care of the details so that they can focus on being curious.  




Kids are quite active and careless sometimes. So we covered the bottle using a durable, eraser-like material to offer better grip and drop protection.





We thought it was really annoying have unreachable spots in our bottle. So we made ours with detachable spout so that you can easily clean or replace them.





No exposed metal, no plugs to plug.  Our bottle features a wireless charging cradle. So that all you have to do is drop it in the dock and watch the charging fish recharge itself. 






Drops happen.  Just pick it up and keep going.  Our bottle is covered in shock absorbing material to withstand drops up to 1 meter.  




Take Gululu for a wash! It is certified IP67 dust and water proof.  Meaning that it can be submerged in water within 1 meter for up to 30 minutes.   









The Gululu Universe: Ima and the Dream Guardian
We designed not only a bottle and a game, but a world behind, called the Gululu Universe!  By drinking water, children guide virtual pets and explore the Gululu Universe. Gululu gives kids a mission and a spark for the imagination, which enhances their motivation to drink a healthy amount of water. The first chapter of Ima and the Dream Guardian  is unfolding! See how amazing it is!




Interaction with pets
Touching or shaking the bottle causes the virtual pet to react by laughing, leaping, and playing. Pets grow and evolve over time, and kids develop a connection to their animated pets. 







We define Gululu as a child-centric product, so working closely with the kids is a must! After a long time in the research and testing phase, Gululu has launched the pilot user program. We gathered pilot users from USA, UK and countries all around the world, and initialed the first Gululu community!





“This is a dream come true for me (and my daughter). It both allows me to monitor her water intake, even when she is away from me, at school, and it will help motivate her to remember to actually drink her water, plus it's made for kids, so durable!”  -Lisa
 ""The 8 year old boy loved setting it up and bringing it to school!"" -Michelle




""I wanted to tell you that my son loves his bottle. He won’t let it out of his sight!  He loves Ninji and the sword makes him laugh so loudly. "" -Eva
""To make a comparison, wearable fitness trackers generally offer limited functionality as a stand alone device. Although additional information may be available through an app, the product can be used straight out of the box. "" -Eric

About 2 years ago Wistiki’s first tracker was launched in France. 
We
sold many of them, and it proved that French people lose their things a

<p><strong>About The Get Him Out of His Skin Project</strong><br/>My name is Steven Farmer and I'm a fitness professional that has been training Randy Gill for a little over a year. Within that time he has lost 130lbs and 16% Body Fat.</p>
<p><br/>This is important to me because it's important to Randy. This all he lives for. Randy was on the verge of serious health problems, almost being fired for his heavy breathing, had trouble sleeping, heart palpatations., and even had a hunch on his back. Now he's in tremendous shape, and he only cares about working out. I'd like him to finally be able to reach his goals so he can focus on the other areas of his life. No one deserves this more than Randy<br/>Randy will go from being almost 500lbs to having a 6 pack. Randy will be able to become a personal trainer, working in the field he loves. Randy will finally be able to walk around without a shirt and not be self-conscious. Randy will meet more girls(sounds shallow but you know it's true), more opportunites in life, and show that no matter where you started you can achieve your goals.</p>
<p>Donations Are Tax Deductible!</p>

<p><br/>We need $9,000 and it will all go towards Randy's skin reduction surgery. Removing excess tissue from his midsection as well as give him a pectoral lift.</p>

<p>Hello, my name is Jean Nicol and I have been trying to support Robert Moldenhauer and his parents any way I can for the past 7 months. I am a very passionate autism advocate and my heart went out to this young man who had been refused the life saving treatment he needed by 8 hospitals, 2 in their home state of Wisconsin, USA. They could not provide dialysis for him because he is autistic. Their advice to let him die was not an option for Robert’s parents.</p>
<p>Robert has been receiving needed treatment at Boston Children’s for nearly 6 months. Now strong enough to have a kidney transplant, with a donor waiting, they begin a lengthy period of tests and preparation.</p>
<p>I am hoping by setting up this campaign to run briefly until Oct 17/12 we can raise $50,000 they will need to live in Boston for approx 1 year. Robert has made tremendous gains in the past 6 months with the marvelous care he has received at Boston Children’s. They will face huge medical bills one day as their health insurance with Physicians’ Insurance will not cover out of state care costs. But for now they just need our help so they can live in Boston to celebrate Robert’s good health when he gets his new kidney! Your contribution will help make this possible.</p>
<p>The Moldenhauers have been living at Yawkey House near the hospital, funded by donations that have run out and now they must leave there and find an apt. The minimum rent for a 1 bdrm apt near the hospital  is $2000 plus they have transportation costs when Robert’s father must return to work in WI every 2 weeks. They will need approx $50,000 over the next year to rent a 1 bdr apt near the hospital, transportation costs for when dad has to return to work in WI every 2 weeks and medical costs for medications, nutritional supplements and special renal dietary requirements.</p>
<p>$50,000 is a lot to raise in 2 weeks but I know it can be done and we need to do this. I have followed Robert’s struggle with challenges and his strength over the past 7 months. Robert has certainly displayed  a  will to live, we need to provide the means for him to do that!</p>
<p>Know that by contributing to this campaign you will help to save his life. What a wonderful opportunity that is!</p>
<p>If we don’t make it to $50,000 by Oct 17 we will have what we raise minus 9% in fees. Let’s work together to not lose that 9%.</p>
<p>I was originally drawn to know about Robert because he is autistic and it is my passion to do what I can for children and families living with autism. I have come to know Robert’s family well over the past 7 months and still want to help for these reasons but now because I look at the health challenges he has had since birth and the strength he has had to overcome them.  I want to help him to again be able to live a healthy life but I can’t do this alone, I need the help of many who will donate to this campaign. The Cardiologist says his heart is very strong again, with the good medical care he has had the past 5 months at Boston Children’s, and should last a lifetime. This is the transplanted heart he received shortly after birth!</p>
<p>If at this time you find you are unable to contribute financially there are other ways you can help by sharing this story with others and helping us get more donations. Use available indiegogo share tools.</p>

<p>Our <strong>Volunteer Airline Pilots</strong> are trained in the most advanded aircraft in the world. Everyday they are responsible for thousands of travelers to get to their destinations. There are many situations in normal operations such as weather, other traffic and terrain that a pilot must be equipped with the best techonlogy available to ensure the safety of flight. With the added element of navigating to remote areas after sustaining a natural disaster not only requires the well trained pilots, but also the proper equipement needed for the safety of the passengers. It is for these reasons that the Volunteer Airline Pilots choose the Challenger 604 to complete this mission. It is the aircraft that we are most familiar with and feel the safest completing the mission of LifeAbove ministry worldwide.  </p>

<p>One key aspect of <strong>LifeAbove's mission is providing medical rehabilitation to the victims and responders of a natural diaster</strong>. Although, many foreign aid respond to natural disasters to help and give medical care to the victims in response to saving lives, rehabilitation services are severly lacking.

DID YOU KNOW...
That after the wake of terror from the earthquake in Haiti, airlines suspended their travel to and from Haiti from January 12th until February 19th. For over a month, people suffered and the only air travel in and out of Haiti were business/cargo aircraft. LifeAbove's mission will help end the suffering...
LifeAbove Mission
LifeAbove is a nonprofit Christian organization committed to providing rehabilitation to God's children that have sustained injuries or disabilities as a result from a natural disaster event. LifeAbove is a ministry from Life Church based out of Bloomington MN.


Deployment Ready: LifeAbove teams plan on being deployment ready, travel arranged and on scene with an assignment confirmed by our host country to reduce response times for victims.


Critical Phase Response: Identify people post-trauma care to start rehabilitation to minimize future functional impairment and disability.


Mobilize Phase Support: Develop and initiate rehabilitation programs that focus on mobilizing victims to become self reliant/producing for their family and community.


Infrastructure Development: Initiate long term educational/community based rehabilitation programs with communities for persons with disabilities.


LifeAbove purpose is to show Christ love through aviation, medicine and counseling by providing humanitarian aid to areas affected by natural disasters and/or have a lack of rehabilitative resources.
TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE TODAY!

What will the money be used for...
Aviation

Our Volunteer Airline Pilots are trained in the most advanded aircraft in the world. Everyday they are responsible for thousands of travelers to get to their destinations. There are many situations in normal operations such as weather, other traffic and terrain that a pilot must be equipped with the best techonlogy available to ensure the safety of flight. With the added element of navigating to remote areas after sustaining a natural disaster not only requires the well trained pilots, but also the proper equipement needed for the safety of the passengers. It is for these reasons that the Volunteer Airline Pilots choose the Challenger 604 to complete this mission. It is the aircraft that we are most familiar with and feel the safest completing the mission of LifeAbove ministry worldwide.  

Instead of purchasing an $12,000,000 aircraft, it is in our best interest based on the amount of hours we operate (approx 100) the aircraft to lease.
Monthly lease = $45,000.00 per month
Hourly Cost =$600.00 per hour (Engines & Maintenance Reserve)
Hanger Rental = $15,000.00 per year
Insurance = $45,000.00
Fuel = $179,000 per year (based on Fuel burn @ 100 hours per year)

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>20fold world record holder Wim Hof (the Iceman) has developed a method that enables humans to positively influence their auto immune system and fight a number of related diseases in 3 simple steps. Gradual exposure to the cold, breathing exercises and focus of the mind. Anyone can learn these skills in only a few days. </b></p>
<p>On the 24th of january 2014, a team of 25 healthy and ill people, guided by ’the Iceman’ Wim Hof, will set off for Tanzania to climb the Kilimanjaro (5890m), accompanied by a medical research team from the prestigious UMC Radbout university Nijmegen. Amongst the climbers are people with Cancer, Rheumatism, Asthma, Crohn’s disease, and Multiple Sclerosis. They will climb the Kilimanjaro shirtless, wearing only shorts and shoes in only 3 days (usually takes 6).</p>
<p>Why? To show that it is possible for humans to transcend themselves, their diseases and to directly influence their autonomous nervous system and hence the auto immune system. The challenge is threefoold. First there is the extreme cold at the top (up to minus 20 degrees celcius / xx degrees fahrenheit). Then there is the physical challenge of ascending 4500 meters on a 35km route in just 3 days. But the biggest challenge is the danger of altitude disease. It is not unusual for an ascend in altitude this fast that less than 40% of the attendees reach the summit. Above 4000 m there is only 60 % of oxygen in the air. By applying the special breathing techniques and extreme focus, the teammembers will influence their auto immunesystem and rapidly increase the count of red bloodcells in their blood, which is required to cope with the shortage of oxigen which causes altitude disease (which can be deadly).</p>
<p>By exposing his body to extreme circumstances in nature for over 35 years, Wim Hof discovered a method which any human being can learn in just a few days. It allows for control over his or her autonomic nervous system (something science claims to be impossible). In turn, this control allows people to activate the self-healing capacities of the body and thereby positively help the body fight against diseases. We need further scientific research to gather official proof for the excelent results we are already seeing amongst the teammembers for this expedition.</p>
<p>Absolute astonishment about the capacity of our body. Is that simple for us to affect our immune system? Step by step our skeptical view changed into amazement. How far can one reach with the Wim Hof Method (WHM)? Imagine how ill people could influence their health and how healthy people could become so much fitter, stronger and more energetic. The medical researchers have been chained to these questions since they connected to the Wim Hof Method and their current main purpose has become to collect hard scientific evidence to change the worldwide belief about true human potential with the right mind/body connection. It is therefore that medical professors all over the world are interested in the results Wim Hof has achieved. Wim holds over 20 world records, mostly related to challenging and surviving the extreme cold.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What Do You Get</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>We will apply the funds from this campaign to cover the expenses for the scientific medical staff and equipment that is required to scientifically record all medical data of teammembers. Any additional funds would be used to cover for additional expenses made by the team as a whole.</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>In order to convince medical staff and common laymen around the world of the amazing and powefull results of the simple but effective Wim Hof method, we need more scientific evidence. The Kilimanjaro climb is one of the events we are organising to gather this evidence. During the Kilimanjaro trip we will use the extreme circumstances as our reference; the goal is to show how the method could also be added to combat against auto-imune diseases. </p>

Two very close friends of mine had Alcohol Flush Reaction (AFR) and were complaining about a lack of solutions. I started to do some research and soon found out about the serious health risks associated with AFR (those with it are at significantly increased risk of gastric and esophageal cancer, liver cirrhosis, and even Alzheimer's Disease). Not just was this a cosmetic problem, or an immediate problem, but a very important medical and health issue, that not many are aware of. I spent the next two years obsessing, researching, formulating, and testing the NoGlo product based on the specific disorder.</p><p>AFR is caused by a genetic mutation which leads to a deficiency in breaking down a compound called acetaldehyde, a known carcinogen that is 30-times as toxic as alcohol. Acetaldehyde is created from alcohol when you drink it. Since those with AFR cannot break it down properly, it accumulates to extreme levels in the blood, causing dizziness, nausea, headache, increased heart rate and body temperature, and intense red facial flushing. Additionally it leads to the oxidative damage that may lead to the long-term health issues described above. NoGlo is designed to reduce the accumulation of acetaldehyde.</p><p>We recently completed an internal-placebo controlled, human clinical trial for the NoGlo product in Los Angeles, CA. All subjects in the study had AFR. The trial demonstrated a reduction in the symptoms of dizziness, nausea, lightheadedness, overheating, and physical discomfort. More importantly however, NoGlo significantly reduced the blood acetaldehyde levels that lead to the symptoms and damage. </p><p>NoGlo is an encapsulated formula designed to be taken daily for best effect, or 1 hour before you drink. NoGlo can really help people. We have researched it, developed it, and tested it and it is time to get it out to the people who should really know about it!</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What we need to spread NoGlo and AFR awareness, and what you will receive for helping our cause! </h3><p>Our goals are to spread awareness about Alcohol Flush Reaction as a serious problem beyond just turning red, and to spread awareness about the NoGlo product, which can positively impact the lives and health of those with AFE. </p><p>We are asking for funds so that we can continue the development of the NoGlo product, and spread the word about NoGlo to those it will benefit. It takes a lot to spread a message, even if it is something great. </p><p>In return we will give you what we make... NoGlo! Even if you don't have Alcohol Flush Reaction (AFR), NoGlo is a potent anti-hangover product, because the same compound that causes the redness and all the damage and symptoms of AFR, is the same compound that leads to hangovers in any drinker! This compound is called acetaldehyde, and reducing its accumulation is what NoGlo demonstrated in our recent clinical study. It is also filled with some of the strongest anti-oxidants known to promote general health. All ingredients are recognized and established as safe by the US FDA.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Our Impact</h3><p>AFR is a problem that affects approximately 1 billion people globally, and 40% of all people of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean descent. It is an enormous unmet need with real health implication. Your contribution will help us not only spread a product that will help, but also spread knowledge. A huge hurdle in tackling AFR is education, because many who have it are not aware of the health risks and should be drinking responsibly and moderately if they are going to drink. The more people know, the more we can make lifestyle decisions with our health in mind.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Just spread the word!

Additionally it leads to the oxidative damage that may lead to the long-term health issues described above. NoGlo is designed to reduce the accumulation of acetaldehyde.We recently completed an internal-placebo controlled, human clinical trial for the NoGlo product in Los Angeles, CA. All subjects in the study had AFR. The trial demonstrated a reduction in the symptoms of dizziness, nausea, lightheadedness, overheating, and physical discomfort. More importantly however, NoGlo significantly reduced the blood acetaldehyde levels that lead to the symptoms and damage. NoGlo is an encapsulated formula designed to be taken daily for best effect, or 1 hour before you drink. NoGlo can really help people. We have researched it, developed it, and tested it and it is time to get it out to the people who should really know about it!What we need to spread NoGlo and AFR awareness, and what you will receive for helping our cause! Our goals are to spread awareness about Alcohol Flush Reaction as a serious problem beyond just turning red, and to spread awareness about the NoGlo product, which can positively impact the lives and health of those with AFE. We are asking for funds so that we can continue the development of the NoGlo product, and spread the word about NoGlo to those it will benefit. It takes a lot to spread a message, even if it is something great. In return we will give you what we make... NoGlo! Even if you don't have Alcohol Flush Reaction (AFR), NoGlo is a potent anti-hangover product, because the same compound that causes the redness and all the damage and symptoms of AFR, is the same compound that leads to hangovers in any drinker! This compound is called acetaldehyde, and reducing its accumulation is what NoGlo demonstrated in our recent clinical study. It is also filled with some of the strongest anti-oxidants known to promote general health. All ingredients are recognized and established as safe by the US FDA.Our ImpactAFR is a problem that affects approximately 1 billion people globally, and 40% of all people of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean descent. It is an enormous unmet need with real health implication. Your contribution will help us not only spread a product that will help, but also spread knowledge. A huge hurdle in tackling AFR is education, because many who have it are not aware of the health risks and should be drinking responsibly and moderately if they are going to drink. The more people know, the more we can make lifestyle decisions with our health in mind.Other Ways You Can HelpJust spread the word!

<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>The United States produces approximately 6 million tons of medical waste each year.  Much of this is equipment and supplies that are still in usable condition.</p>
<p>At the same time, Cameroon suffers some of the worst supported health care on earth.  Cameroon was ranked number 164 out of 190 countries considered by the World Health Organization.  The Cameroonian government spends only 0.9% of its GDP on health, contrary to the World Health Organization’s recommended minimum of 4%.  With 48% of the population living below the poverty line, this leaves a burden for health payments the Cameroonian people cannot afford to bear: 80% of the population cannot afford even basic health care. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Our Mission</h3>
<p>SHARE is dedicated to promoting sustainable healthcare through the recycling of used medical equipment from the US for use in Cameroon.  SHARE aims to bridge the disconnect between the excess of recycled equipment in the United States and the need for equipment in Cameroonian hospitals.</p>
<p>The basis of SHARE can be summarized by 4 Cs: Contact, Collect, Consign, and Coach. Contact hospitals in the developing nations that are in dire need of supplies and equipment, collect the medical supplies, consign the needed supplies to developing nations (starting in Cameroon), and coach the physicians on proper care and use of equipment. Our focus is not only to provide support in the initial stages with medical supplies and extensive internal training, but also to foster the hospitals abroad to become self-sufficient without us in the long-run.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will make a real and lasting impact.  Our pilot partner hospital is one of only two mental health hospitals serving the entire Cameroonian population of 20 million people. The hospital also has pulmonary and HIV/AIDS divisions, and the staff is dedicated and passionate about their patients.  However, there is a severe lack of equipment, particularly beds.  Your contribution will help us ship beds and other equipment to this hospital, transforming the lives of the patients there.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Our Vision</h3>
<p>SHARE is unique in that we are training and providing long-term support to develop hospital autonomy. In addition, our final goal is to differentiate SHARE from other organizations by creating enduring connections between hospitals in the United States and Cameroon.  To do so, we plan to implement a “Sister Hospital” program, as well as to create an online database to improve the connection between suppliers of equipment in the United States and seekers of equipment abroad.</p>
<p>Within one year's time following the first shipment, SHARE will collaborate with the partner hospital to create a statistical analysis of the impact of the equipment, which will involve both qualitative and quantitative studies.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our vision is for a world in which Cameroonian hospitals can function to their full potential, and provide their patients with the care they deserve. </p>
<p>Please join us in our efforts! Every little bit counts.</p>

At the same time, Cameroon suffers some of the worst supported health care on earth.  Cameroon was ranked number 164 out of 190 countries considered by the World Health Organization.  The Cameroonian government spends only 0.9% of its GDP on health, contrary to the World Health Organization’s recommended minimum of 4%.  With 48% of the population living below the poverty line, this leaves a burden for health payments the Cameroonian people cannot afford to bear: 80% of the population cannot afford even basic health care. 


Our Mission
SHARE is dedicated to promoting sustainable healthcare through the recycling of used medical equipment from the US for use in Cameroon.  SHARE aims to bridge the disconnect between the excess of recycled equipment in the United States and the need for equipment in Cameroonian hospitals.
The basis of SHARE can be summarized by 4 Cs: Contact, Collect, Consign, and Coach. Contact hospitals in the developing nations that are in dire need of supplies and equipment, collect the medical supplies, consign the needed supplies to developing nations (starting in Cameroon), and coach the physicians on proper care and use of equipment. Our focus is not only to provide support in the initial stages with medical supplies and extensive internal training, but also to foster the hospitals abroad to become self-sufficient without us in the long-run.


The Impact
Your contribution will make a real and lasting impact.  Our pilot partner hospital is one of only two mental health hospitals serving the entire Cameroonian population of 20 million people. The hospital also has pulmonary and HIV/AIDS divisions, and the staff is dedicated and passionate about their patients.  However, there is a severe lack of equipment, particularly beds.  Your contribution will help us ship beds and other equipment to this hospital, transforming the lives of the patients there.


Our Vision
SHARE is unique in that we are training and providing long-term support to develop hospital autonomy. In addition, our final goal is to differentiate SHARE from other organizations by creating enduring connections between hospitals in the United States and Cameroon.  To do so, we plan to implement a “Sister Hospital” program, as well as to create an online database to improve the connection between suppliers of equipment in the United States and seekers of equipment abroad.
Within one year's time following the first shipment, SHARE will collaborate with the partner hospital to create a statistical analysis of the impact of the equipment, which will involve both qualitative and quantitative studies.  
 
Our vision is for a world in which Cameroonian hospitals can function to their full potential, and provide their patients with the care they deserve.

The clinic was built in response to the need for accessible, quality healthcare in Bunabuyoka and the surrounding areas. This village has a population of 3,000 people, and the only way to access the community is by hiking a steep mountain. </p>

<li>People die each year from preventable illnesses, like diarrhea.</li>
<li>Mothers deliver their own babies with only a razor blade to cut the umbilical cord.</li>
</ul><p>Construction of the health clinic was a joint effort between HELP volunteers and the members of the village. For the first time, the people of Bunabuyoka now have access to a doctor and are able to receive life-saving care at the Zion Medical Community Clinic! The clinic officially opened on February 6, 2013, holding clinic days on Tuesdays and Wednesdays each week. It is operating very successfully and is providing quality healthcare and health education in a very efficient and effective manner. And the waiting room is always full! People come from villages all over the mountain to receive treatment at the Zion Clinic. On average, the clinic treats about 100 patients each week. The clinic also provides health education to the community through a team of 20 trained community health educators.</p>
<p align=""left"">Despite these successes, ZMCC is currently facing great financial challenges. Through a cost-sharing program, patients pay a small fee for services and medication to help fund the clinic’s operational costs. However, residents of this village struggle to meet basic needs—daily meals, clean water and adequate housing. Patients are only able to pay 2,000 Ugandan Shillings, about $0.80, per visit, which does not cover the full operating costs of the clinic. In addition, the recent loss of a large grant that had been promised to ZMCC has left the clinic operating off of little to no funds, and it is often in debt to multiple sources. The amazing staff at ZMCC has been very understanding, and in the past 5 months, they have only been paid 2 months salary. Each week, administrators scramble to try to find money to pay for the staff’s food and transport and money to keep the clinic stocked with essential medications, but the clinic will not be able to operate much longer under these circumstances.</p>
<p align=""left"">Plans are being put in place for the future financial sustainability of the clinic, but none of these can provide funding to ZMCC in the immediate future. Therefore, we are launching this fundraiser with the goal of raising one year of operational costs for the clinic. This will allow the clinic to function more normally and without the daily financial stress while the clinic’s administrators work on securing more funding and further developing sustainability plans for the future.

<p>My name is Anton Kodra and I am part of a non-profit organization associated with the University of Utah and the Bennion Community Service Center called Running Forward. This is an awesome program that takes place in underprivileged communities around Salt Lake County. We go to local elementary schools and train 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> grade students to run and teach them valuable life lessons to better their future outlook. We are practicing every week with them right now to help them reach their goal of running in a 5K at the end of the school year. This program teaches the kids self-confidence and the importance of exercising and being healthy. We teach them weekly lessons on subjects such as finances, choosing good friends, and academic goals. I will be running in the SLC Half-Marathon this spring to raise money for 150 youth in Running Forward. Contributors will have a huge impact on these amazing kids. Most of them will never get the chance to run in a fresh pair of Nikes, Asics, or any other new running shoe. The money raised will go towards purchasing new running shoes and program shirts for the talented young kids who complete their 5K race. It will also be a message of encouragement to help these youth reach their full potential.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So, I am asking for any donation at all, as every little bit helps. If the kids all had bigger feet, I would donate my shoe collection. I need to raise $500 to contribute to my organization’s needs. The money will go towards making this year’s program shirts for Running Forward and also to purchasing many pairs of new running shoes. These kids are great and they need your help! What’s more exciting than donating towards a cause that helps our community’s youth? There will be perks for donating to our program. You will be able to send messages of encouragement, get race updates, and be invited to help with the Sports Days and training for our 5K race. The goal is set at $500, but as I said before all donations count and even if I don’t reach my entire goal, the funds will still be put to use for our organizational needs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This project is an excellent way to keep the youth in our community active and engaged. A lot of them may come from “rough backgrounds” with a negative outlook on life and their future. This project helps motivate them to set and accomplish goals that are important in their lives and to their future success. We teach them simple life lessons, which go beyond the basic math and reading they learn in the classroom. We apply what they learn academically to real world situations and examples. As a pre-med student, one of my goals and visions on becoming a doctor is to promote public health and health awareness, especially in youth. Health and exercise are very important and can lead to a better quality of life. These kids are awesome and have a lot of talent and potential. I see the next Alan Webb in the group, and some of these kids will be faster than I ever was.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I appreciate your time and consideration. Even if you can’t contribute funds, there are still ways to help! Spread the word about Running Forward. This is a great program affiliated with the University of Utah. Make some noise about youth programs in your area, and see what you can do to help!
