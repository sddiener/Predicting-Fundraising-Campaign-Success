<h3>The CFT: Your Hub for Tattoo Education</h3>
<p>The Center for Tattoo History and Culture is a new, not-for-profit foundation that operates outside of traditional academic channels. Our team consists of an ever-growing group of passionate people who believe that we can rethink how academic and archival tattoo-related content is made available to anyone interested in doing deeper research. We come from a wide variety of backgrounds: anthropology, archaeology, art history, history, library science, philosophy, popular culture studies, the tattoo industry, and more. We're admittedly nerdy, and we care deeply about making sure that tattoo myths are not perpetuated and that quality content about tattoo history and culture is readily accessible.</p>
<p>Tattooing has experienced unprecedented global popularity in the 21st century. Ever more people have been interested in studying tattooing in a formal way. But expert knowledge can be hard to find. Resources are currently scattered across libraries and museums, hidden away in private collections, randomly spread across numerous internet archives. This has left large gaps in the corpus of scholarly resources and caused people seeking tattoo knowledge to fend for themselves, often relying upon erroneous secondary sources that perpetuate myth, treat folklore as fact, or promote theories based on outdated concepts.</p>
<p>The CFT will be a virtual “center”—a digital hub with a variety of public-facing informational services and a subscription-based* area for those doing more intensive research. This way, we can reach far more people in a much easier way than the current mess of having to visit never-ending numbers of websites, pay for (often exorbitant) access to traditional academic journals, vainly google-search for that article you loved that you read 5 years ago but which now seems to have disappeared, endlessly scroll through an Instagram feed to try to find an image you remember was maybe posted by a certain person...Phew. Sound familiar? We have solutions for you!</p>
<p>Beyond our digital platform, we also seek to create a research- and archives-based tattoo community. As advisory board member, Kimberly Baltzer-Jaray, mentions in the video above: the CFT “can bring together amateurs and scholars from across the globe: so philosophers like myself...anthropologists, sociologists, psychologists, fine arts majors, everyday people, anyone, everyone who's interested in anything to do with tattooing.”</p>
<p>Please read about our many planned projects on our website: <a href=""https://centerfortattoo.org/projects/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://centerfortattoo.org/projects/</a></p>
<p>*Our subscription-based area will always be free for students and low-income researchers who can provide appropriate documentation.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why does the Center for Tattoo History and Culture need funding?</h3>
<p>All of the CFT's resources will be available digital-humanities style through a website-based interface. Since our mission is an educational one, not a profit-making one, we will be incorporating as a 501(c)3 not-for-profit organization. Not having a brick-and-mortar location saves us a lot in overhead!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">1) We have so much amazing information and so many resources to share, but we need to create the proper digital platform. A large part of our campaign will let us hire a web development team that can create a site that has both a content-rich public face and an even content-richer subscription service that hosts text-, image-, and ultimately video-intensive databases. We’ll also be hosting discussion forums and ways for enthusiasts to help volunteer for the project à la citizen-scientist initiatives. This will be an expensive website to build—not a DIY Wordpress project, as much as many of us involved with the CFT love dabbling in web development. With our $30,000 campaign successfully funded, we will be able to build phase one of the website: a set of public-facing informational pages, a structure for starting in on our database projects, and a subscription interface. With our stretch goal met (see below), we can build the entire site that we have envisioned.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">2) Setting up a foundation as a properly accredited 501(c)3 takes proper professional help. We’d like to hire a legal team (hopefully at discounted rates) to make sure all our t’s are crossed and our i’s dotted so that we’re serving the public good correctly and that we’ll be well-positioned to raise additional money through government and private-foundation grants. We also want to hire an accounting team to make sure that all funds are allocated responsibly. As a 501(c)3, all of the legal and financial side of things will be transparent.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">3) Quality content requires fees that range from licensing arrangements to paying people to share their intellectual property. We are tired of so many content mills that refuse to pay contributors (hmmmmm…perhaps that's why there are so many problems with tattoo-related content out there on the internet?). The foundation deeply believes in paying contributors to the project for their work and so the last part of the initial goal will be to begin compensating CFT writers and researchers to upload quality content to the website.</p>
<p>We’d like to add a stretch goal beyond the initial $30,000 that comprises an additional $30,000. This will enable the CFT to build the entire website we envision complete with discussion forums, e-commerce, and citizen-scientist capacity, and upload even more content while awaiting successful grant applications and fund disbursement.</p>
<p>If we don’t meet our funding goal, it just means it might take us longer to implement the first phase of the foundation project—we’ll focus on getting all of our paperwork in order and phase in the web development and content uploading over a longer time frame. But we have a feeling that there are many of you out there with an equal passion for tattoo history and culture who would like to see our vision become a reality. Let’s get the CFT funded!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>We’re offering a range of perks to fit a variety of budgets and levels of interest in researching tattoos. See the perk list for our complete offerings, but here are some highlights:</p>
<p>For those of you who anticipate researching tattooing on a regular basis over several years and paying to use our comprehensive text-, image-, and oral-history databases, we have two particularly value-minded perks:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">•A lifetime behind-the-paywall subscription for a donation of $200—the price of a small tattoo! We’ll be starting the subscription service at an annual fee of $25, and as we continue to add more content, the annual price will go up. With successful funding, we hope to have the subscription area of the website ready by this time next year.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">•A 2-years-for-the-price-of-1 subscription for a donation of $25—you can even select what year you’d like this to begin. (For example, if you are a student now, and thus subject to a free annual subscription, you can elect to redeem your subscription once you’re done with school.)</p>
<p>For those of you who have a more casual interest in tattoo history and culture and will be primarily using our public-facing content such as our blog and our referral service, we have many ways you can help crowdfund the foundation from standard t-shirts and stickers to more unique items:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">•A set of temporary tattoos for a donation of $20—the CFT logo plus 7 other designs hand-chosen by our advisory board members to reflect their research. These motifs will help you travel across the world and through time.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">•A $5 “the CFT is awesome” donation for those of you who are looking forward to having the public-facing part of the CFT to browse or for those of you frustrated by academia and excited to see a scholarly project being created outside the walls of the ivory tower. Of course, you are welcome to contribute much more...</p>

<div>
<p>My name is Nadine
Dorvelus, I was born and raised in Port-Au-Prince, Haiti, but have lived in New
York for over 20 years. During the time that I lived in Haiti, much of the
country’s population was under a state of poverty; this frequently occurred at
the expense of the island’s children - parents often didn’t have enough food to
feed their children or money to send them to school or provide adequate
clothing or shelter. I grew up watching so many abandoned children roaming the
streets during all hours of the day and night, in search of food, shelter and
sometimes their parents. Some who consider themselves fortunate end up living
with strangers who treat them as child slave. Before the devastating 2010 earthquake,
400,000 children, approximately 1 of 10, were living in an orphanage. After the
earthquake struck, that number quickly doubled and added to the already urgent condition
of children with nowhere to go. </p>
<p>In
2012, I, along with a few close friends from Haiti, <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">founded </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Oceanie
Orphanage of Haiti</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">, </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Inc.</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> with the
belief that every child, despite circumstances, deserves an opportunity to simply
be a child - to laugh, play, run, grow and be happy. In 2014, we got approved
as a 501(c)(3) organization, and Oceanie Orphanage moved a step closer to
coming to fruition.</span></p>
</div>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>Our target is to raise at least <b>$50,000</b> by November 30, 2015. This amount will support <b>Oceanie Orphanage of Haiti</b> in the following ways:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Purchase (or temporarily rent) a house and other accompanying expenses, including furniture, beds, tables, and chairs for about 10children;</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Support the daily needs for our children including hygiene care, clothing, and food during the first few months of operations;</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Establish an educational and training program for our children in our first year of operation; and</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Support the general operations including wages for staff</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>100% of all funds donated
to this campaign will be given to the <b>Oceanie
Orphanage of Haiti, Inc.</b>. Full accounting of the funds donated will
take place by the conclusion of the 2015 calendar year and will be
published along with <b>Oceanie Orphanage
of Haiti’s</b> yearly financials. All donations are tax-deductible.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>Our goal is to purchase a home or
facility in an area in Haiti with less outreach than the areas that have
received attention since 2012 and to house about 10 children by Spring 2016. We will

</div></div>","Short Summary

My name is Nadine
Dorvelus, I was born and raised in Port-Au-Prince, Haiti, but have lived in New
York for over 20 years. During the time that I lived in Haiti, much of the
country’s population was under a state of poverty; this frequently occurred at
the expense of the island’s children - parents often didn’t have enough food to
feed their children or money to send them to school or provide adequate
clothing or shelter. I grew up watching so many abandoned children roaming the
streets during all hours of the day and night, in search of food, shelter and
sometimes their parents. Some who consider themselves fortunate end up living
with strangers who treat them as child slave. Before the devastating 2010 earthquake,
400,000 children, approximately 1 of 10, were living in an orphanage. After the
earthquake struck, that number quickly doubled and added to the already urgent condition
of children with nowhere to go. 
In
2012, I, along with a few close friends from Haiti, founded Oceanie
Orphanage of Haiti, Inc. with the
belief that every child, despite circumstances, deserves an opportunity to simply
be a child - to laugh, play, run, grow and be happy. In 2014, we got approved
as a 501(c)(3) organization, and Oceanie Orphanage moved a step closer to
coming to fruition.


What We Need & What You Get 
Our target is to raise at least $50,000 by November 30, 2015. This amount will support Oceanie Orphanage of Haiti in the following ways:



Purchase (or temporarily rent) a house and other accompanying expenses, including furniture, beds, tables, and chairs for about 10children;


Support the daily needs for our children including hygiene care, clothing, and food during the first few months of operations;


Establish an educational and training program for our children in our first year of operation; and


Support the general operations including wages for staff



100% of all funds donated
to this campaign will be given to the Oceanie
Orphanage of Haiti, Inc.. Full accounting of the funds donated will
take place by the conclusion of the 2015 calendar year and will be
published along with Oceanie Orphanage
of Haiti’s yearly financials. All donations are tax-deductible.

The Impact
Our goal is to purchase a home or
facility in an area in Haiti with less outreach than the areas that have
received attention since 2012 and to house about 10 children by Spring 2016. We will
use additional funds raised through this campaign to provide the children with
food, education, clothing, medical care, etc.
   Risks & Challenges In the Haitian culture, there is a saying: piti, piti, swazo fè nich li, meaning that ‘little by little the bird builds its nest,’ the undertaking of Oceanie Orphanage of Haiti is no small feat, we realize this, but we are committed and ready for the challenge of changing the lives of Haitian children for generations to come until poverty is eradicated in our home country. There is a tremendous amount of work to be done, and with your help, building our nest, the Oceanie Orphanage of Haiti, will be possible!

Pelser and Lodewyk Uys here.  We are 2 very excited entrepreneurs from Gauteng, South Africa.
 My brother and I started making our dream a reality about 2 years ago when we launched our first web-based startup company called Notes&Crosses.
Notes&Crosses is an online platform where students can sell and buy study notes as well as get online tutoring.  Students looove the idea and we can see it making a real difference when studying for exams!
We have seen some steady growth and have been bootstrapping (funding the company from our own pockets, no easy feat!) the company for the last 24 months.  We recently entered and were interviewed by the ""the best technology conference on the planet"" (according to Forbes) called Websummit.  Much to our surprise and delight they invited us to exhibit our company at WebSummit 2015 happening in November 2015 in Dublin, Ireland! Seeing as they interviewed close to 25 000 startups and, in 2014, only 10 startups from Africa was invited, we see this as a massive opportunity! 
Websummit you might say, what is that? 
Basically, its where the Tech World meets.  Investors, inventors, startups and massive Fortune 500 companies (Google, Facebook etc.) from 130 different countries come together for 3 days of conversations, talks and pitching of ideas, all happening in Dublin Ireland. This is the place to meet investors, to rub shoulders with the giants of the tech world and to make connections like no other place on earth.
So imagine this - a small (yet growing) startup all the way from South Africa gets invited to exhibit their startup and showcase it to the world, we are over the moon!   What We Need & What You Get
Ok, so we get to exhibit for free and only need to pay a basic registration fee of 1950 Euro.  To put this in perspective - large companies such as Google etc pay 10950 Euros to exhibit at the same event!
What we get when registering:

The package contains:

Four tickets to Web Summit which include access to all three days (500+ speakers across 15 different stages, 100+ Partners, 500+ startups) and the Night Summit. (3 nights of of socialising, networking and building relationships across Dublin’s fair city) .
Exhibition space for one of the three days in your chosen industry area.
Startup Search Profile: Online circulation to investors, media & strategic partners. (this is a massive opportunity!)
Access to partner activations (workshops, roundtables, office hours etc).
Fulfilment officer to help with preparations and gather all your information 5 weeks out from the event.
Access to Web Summit networking app to help you build connections prior to the event & curate your own schedule. (Released 1 week before event).

If we don't reach our goal we will use the money to further develop and grow our product, a win-win situation!
We want to give you something in return - so why not give us a shopping list or wish list whilst we are in Ireland and we can get it for you?
   The Impact Our long term plan is to expand our startup into Europe and this would be the perfect platform to launch the business in Europe.  
Why did we start Notes&Crosses? Well - we feel that, for the average student, there must be an easier way to study and that the current academic model is outdated.  We offer a platform where students can make money by selling their notes and tutoring online and also a platform where the average student can actually buy study aid and study smarter and believe us, the students love this!
    Risks & Challenges We believe that we have a great product that could really add value to a students life.  The risks involved in going to the Summit is minimal, we know this is a massive opportunity and need to be there to grow our business.
    Other Ways You Can Help If you want to contribute but cannot at this stage - please share the campaign and get the Notes&Crosses word out, but if at all possible, please donate to this cause! 
Kind regards

could grow from within and expand through the very people that it helped?  Armed with a bucket load of ambition, a pinch of

universities offer, millions of students return back to poverty even after

Namaskaram, We have a question for you. Solving or mitigating poverty is a huge task. Is it possible to really solve poverty
with just a SUSTAINABLE model? A model that just keeps the organization's head above water with no room for growth?  This was our question two years ago when we set out on out mission to solve poverty using business principles. Why not solve poverty with a model that was SCALABLE? One that

crazy and two years of trial and error under our belt, we are finally ready
launch that venture, that dream, that change. 
This is not a
side project or something that our team does part-time. We have committed heart and
soul to successfully creating a venture that is capable of solving poverty at
scale. I may not be able to change the world yet -- but I do want to change India. With
your help, we will take our first step in launching a venture that we believe
will solve poverty in India like never before. 
What we need 
Our school focuses on helping slum and village students to transition into the professional work force and pull themselves out of their caste and poverty cycle. We have trained over 150 students in the last two years under the sustainable model. We have room to grow. To build our
first official school and become the brand of helping in India we need to raise a minimum of $15,000. In addition to this amount, we have
found a sponsor who has agreed to match every dollar donated to this campaign. The money raised in this campaign will go towards laying out the foundation for our school, a marketing
budget, legal fee’s and compensation for our early employees.What pain are we solving?
India graduates 6 million college students every year, of which
only 3% are employable due to a lack of soft skills and English fluency. Low
income families send their children to universities in hopes that they will
develop the necessary skills to find quality employment and break free from
generational poverty. Due to the lack of employment preparation that
universities offer, millions of students return back to poverty even after
getting a college education. 
What is our solution?
At KVM we bridge the gap between education and employability. We
have created a state-of-the-art professional development program where
impoverished students can engage in an intensive, two-month English immersion
program that prepares them to face job interviews and ultimately find quality
employment. 

Who do we help?
Our beneficiaries are graduated college students who are seeking
employment. We deal with students from various backgrounds and majors, ranging
from electrical engineering and math to teachers and IT support. All of our
students are between ages 18-28 years old and come from families that aspire to
see their children reach new levels of financial freedom.
How do we measure our success?
Our success will be measured by the
percentage of students we are able to place in the workforce.We have already seen many of our students complete our program

What have we done so far?
We have run KVM in India now for over 2 1/2 years. During
that time we have:
·  Raised seed funds of
$60,000·  Graduated 105 students

<h3><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px;""><h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Baked goods, frozen pizza, and magazine subscriptions. What do all three of these things have in common? Answer: we all have some not-so-fond memories of selling one of these for a school fundraiser. As a result, we ended up with a freezer full of pizza and about three total sales to family members—not exactly the most effective fundraiser for the schools. </p>
<p>The issue of school funding has been around since before most of us can remember but no one has taken the initiative to develop school fundraiser that not only works, but is also one that that students and parents actually want to participate in.</p>
<p>Until now...</p>
<p>WhatINeedforSchool.com is the first and only program of its kind where students, parents, educators, and businesses can work together to raise money for education and earn money for themselves at the same time! That's right, a school fundraiser where instead of receiving unneeded and unwanted rewards for all your hard work, you receive a check with your name on it to be spent on school fees, school supplies, extracurricular activities, or whatever you else you want.</p>

I am a husband and father of five so I know just as well as anyone that sending your kids to school is expensive. With this burden in mind, I began wondering, “How can I help solve the ongoing problem of school funding while helping myself, my family, and my community at the same time?” Finally it hit me. Students could sell a new and advanced savings program as a means of raising money for themselves and their school. Not only would we help raise money for education, but we would also help people save money daily.</p>
<p>In this savings program, the program will be available as an application on your smart phone—no more checking expiration dates or clipping coupons. All our deals will be as easy to access as sending a text message. Our savings program will consist of special deals submitted by both national and local businesses in your community. Every business that signs up will have the opportunity to advertise one standard deal good for one year for FREE! This generates more customers for business while branding them as proud supporters of students, their family's, &amp; schools in the communities they serve.  We will also have two paid advertising programs where businesses can advertise a weekly special or a daily special or both! All of these deals will be pushed out to the users through our mobile application.</p>
<p>Every time someone signs up for our savings program, part of each purchase will go directly to the person who made the sale, part to the school they are supporting, and part to help our company continue to build and expand its capabilities.</p>
<p>But it doesn't end there. We are also in production of The School is Cool Foundation which will receive one dollar of every sale of our $25 savings program. We're setting up this foundation to help students overcome obstacles of adversity in their lives as they work to acquire an education. </p>
<p>In short, EVERYONE wins!</p>
<p>After running a very successful beta test, we began development about a year ago and we now have a fully functioning website with every public school, private school, and college in the country entered in to our database. As our team builds and expands, we will introduce our mobile applications and continue to improve our website and expand our databases of schools to include the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Germany, France, Sweden, Japan, Netherlands, Singapore, and throughout the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Our team, as of now, is small but growing quickly. The team started off with just me and an idea. I hired a team of developers to help get the idea off the ground. On a vacation in March, I met Dann, a communications major, and after his stellar Whitney Houston karaoke performance, I knew I needed Dann working with me on this project so I brought him on board. From there, we began recruiting passionate college interns from all fields to help get WhatINeedForSchool.com fully staffed. Currently the team is around twelve people and growing quickly.</p>

At the end of the day, the only real risk is what are we going to worry about once the issue of school funding is finally solved?",8.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p>I have been teaching and writing about history for 30 years. I have also been an Apple developer for almost that long. I live in Tel Aviv and author a weekly column in Newsweek, entitled “Tel Aviv Diary”. </p>
<p>I work extensively with my son Eytan, currently a high school senior and software developer. Eytan is a three-time recipient of the Apple Student Scholar Award, one of 300 students worldwide to receive that honor annually. At the behest of Moreshet, and with the support of the Polish government, we developed the initial Poland app together, two years ago.</p>
<p>This project is being sponsored by Mordechai Anielevich Memorial Holocaust Study and Research Center. Moreshet  was established by the HaShomer HaTzair Kibbutz movement in 1961 to commemorate Jewish organized resistance during World War II and the Holocaust. All donations to this campaign will be funded through American Friends of Moreshet, a recognized U.S. non-profit organization.</p>
<p><strong>THE PROBLEM</strong></p>
<p>Teaching history has always been my main passion and I have authored over a dozen history apps. Poland is where most of my family comes from, so learning about and exploring the history of Poland and its Jewish community has always been important to me. I have been concerned for some time about our responsibility to understand how we can honor the memory and secure the enduring lessons of the Holocaust after the last survivor and last perpetrator are gone.</p>
<p>OUR SOLUTION</p>
<p>I believe it is critical that we expand our existing Guide to Poland app to include the cities and towns that were home to Poland’s perished Jewish communities. Poland is rapidly changing, and while many of those places have been frozen in time, time is catching up with them. Our window for mapping the remnants of Polish Jewish life (including all of the cemeteries and buildings that were once part of Poland’s vibrant Jewish community) are rapidly closing. </p>
<p>Poland is also a growing tourist destination, with Auschwitz being the singular most visited site. By providing the best and most comprehensive guide app on Poland, we will help define the narrative embraced by travelers to Poland, instead of leaving that mission to others. </p>
<p>WHAT YOU CAN DO</p>
<p>By donating to this campaign you will help ensure that the story of the rest of Polish Jewry will be included in our Poland guide book app.</p>
<p>This funding campaign will allow our research and development team (including several members who live in Poland) to visit each of the towns and villages that once housed a Jewish community and to locate and photograph what remains of the Jewish cemeteries, as well as other Jewish communal buildings. </p>
<p>We believe that if we reach the $20,000 goal, we will be able to include 95% of the cities and towns that made up Jewish Poland in our newly expanded app. If we do not reach our goal, we will still go ahead and expand the app, but we will only cover a modest percentage of the rest of Poland. In the event that we exceed our goal (which is our hope), we will extend the app to include neighboring countries, such as: Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and the Ukraine … AND we will upload the same information and photos included in the app onto a dedicated website.</p>
<p>In addition, as soon as the funds permit, we plan to translate our guidebook app into Polish, Spanish and Chinese. </p>

Donate $30.00 and get a copy of ""No Bullies: Solutions for Saving Our Children From Today's Bullies,"" by Bobby Kipper and Bud Ramey and published by Morgan James Publishing, New York.   The Impact 100% of the proceeds will be used to help bring bullying to an end through our GreenZone™ program.

<p>To that end, the FALLEN HERO MEMORIAL CHEST FUND, a 501c non-profit foundation is being created.  The sole purpose is to make solid cherry memorial chests for military families who have made the ultimate sacrifice.</p>
<p>Memorial Chests are used to store the uniform, medals, gear and flag of a fallen soldier, airman, marine, sailor, police officer or fire fighter.  The chests are bench-made from ethically sourced solid cherry lumber with eco-friendly finishes by ShaKa Studios, in the Greater Houston, Texas area.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Indiegogo Campaign is to raise money to launch the foundation and finish making the first three memorial chests.  The first three recipients are the families of Cpl Tyler S. Trovillion, 2nd Lt Peter H. Burks, and Sgt 1st Class Raymond J. Munden.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1236190/files/20150220103114-Panels_1000_x_700.jpg?1424457074"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<h4>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h4>
<p>We have already started making the first three memorial chests.  The panels have been delivered to the engraver and the chests will be completed in a couple of weeks.  We have also hired an attorney to file the 501c paperwork.</p>

<p>InDemand Goal 1:  If we raise $4800 we can issue a refund to the family of SPC Mabry Anders who purchased the pictured chest. </p>
<p><i>We want to do even more.</i></p>

tricks, and connect with art you are proud to display.</p>

</p>
<p><span>We
live in a time of overloaded instant gratification. Instagram, Facebook,

all about?


We are
Roam Cooperative, thanks for stopping by. We currently consist of three
photographers: Jason Hales, Benjamin Brinker and Aaron Coury. We're going on a
photography journey to Yosemite and we want you to come along!



Why Join
Roam Cooperative?
Unlike
many indiegogo campaigns we do not need funding to go on this trip; our trip is
already paid in full.  We are offering you an opportunity to join our
cooperative, experience Yosemite national park, learn photography tips and
tricks, and connect with art you are proud to display.


We
live in a time of overloaded instant gratification. Instagram, Facebook,
Pinterest and numerous other social platforms feed us fresh content daily. As
photographers, we take pride in creating unique and inspiring images that
hopefully make you stop scrolling, even if only for a few seconds, to take in
the beauty we've captured. 







This project is founded on the
idea that photos are actually captured memories of a specific time that meant
something and they are worth more than a few seconds of view. The
three of us are already good friends, but we know this trip will deepen our
friendship even more. Memories will be made and moments captured forever. 

You
can go to many stores and galleries to buy photographic or many other forms of
art. It may look great on your wall, but beyond that you have no real
connection.  By joining roam cooperative you will get to get to know the
photographers, watch us make your art, know why and how we made it, and know
that you were the reason we made it. 










We want and are asking you to buy prints from our trip. As you follow our journey through our blog, facebook, and instagram,  the
print or prints that you purchase will not only be created with you in mind,
but they will have a story behind them.






We will be showcasing new art every day of our trip (february 22nd - march 1st, 2015), along with behind the scenes footage, and how to videos.  We want this experience to be interactive, so we will be answering questions and taking photo requests (within reason;) from co-op members.  At the end of our trip all cooperative members will be able to choose your art from a combined gallery of all three photographers. We believe in each other, so you won't know who took each photo. We are working together on this trip to create beautiful images for you.










Purchasing prints from this trip not only supports us as photographers, it proves that people still care about the preservation of tangible art.



How do you join roam cooperative?  Simple. Support our campaign.

</h3>
<b><i>Move over “Barney and Friends”.  Look out “Flintstones” and “Jetsons”! <br/></i></b><br/>      The Dino Community(TM) and DinoKids (TM) is a project that I have been working on for over 20 years.  This project brings lively fun stories, interesting facts, and engaging activities to children through dinosaurs.  The stories and songs contain positive messages combined, through fun, with science, sports and music; however, the ""education"" part is subtle.  Children will learn because the stories, songs and activities are all dinosaur-related, creative and interesting.<br/><br/>      Our NEW website will include online coloring books and posters, songs, games and science experiments.  All of the characters in the stories live in the Dino Community.  This is where they go to school, play sports, take music lessons, and join together for group activities.  The characters are engaging, positive role models who creatively resolve age-appropriate conflicts.<br/>       You can view our former website here just to get an idea of the characters, stories and possible activities: <br/><b><a href=""http://www.flutepianoguitar.com/dinokids/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.flutepianoguitar.com/dinokids/</a></b><br/><b>        Please watch for updates, LIKE OUR PAGE and become a friend of The Dino Community:  <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/thedinocommunity"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.facebook.com/thedinocommunity</a><br/><br/>About me:</b><br/>My name is Dr.Kathleen Bondurant. I graduated as the youngest woman in the School of Arts and Sciences with a Ph.D. in Music Education and Music Performance from New York University.  Years ago when my step-children were young, they were really into dinosaurs and complained that there was nothing with dinosaurs on the internet or TV.  This was my inspiration for The Dino Community.  If you have children in your life, I am certain you would like to have trusted activities for them which do not include sex, sexual innuendo, or graphic violence.  This is just fun, imagination and learning about dinosaurs.<br/><br/><b>About my colleagues:</b><br/>Attorney Lisa DeLong is Vice President of Legal Affairs, for contracts, etc...<br/>Attorney Daniel Jochnowitz is our Intellectual Property consultant.<br/>Andrew Morris is Vice President of Advertising and one of a very few certified Google ad specialists and he will be doing the marketing.<br/>Patty Reeh is our Corporate Secretary.<br/>Richard Dean Johnson is our game consultant.<br/>Glen Gibson is our tax and business consultant.<br/>DinoKids Enterprises, Inc. is a privately held corporation.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>The Dino Community is ready to start out as a bilingual website with activities, stories, games and songs.<br/><ul>
<li>Funding is needed for web design to update the original website created in 1998 (which you can see at the end of this presentation) and artwork to illustrate the stories and activities.  <br/>
</li>
<li>A few dollars will go to computer and software upgrades.  None of this money will be going toward salaries or remuneration of the officers.</li>
<li>Funding is needed to master the 8 existing songs and complete two more songs, plus production and marketing of the CD.<br/>
</li>
<li> We also need money for further development of the game and adding sound effects and music.  The game application already exists.<br/>
</li>
<li>As a reward for having faith in this project, you will be entitled to a T-shirt, Tote bag, or the opportunity to name a Dino character.  Please see our ""Perks List"".   As this project grows, there will be many more ""ground floor"" opportunities offered to initial contributors. We always love to make new friends, too!<br/>
</li> <li>Funds will go to expand on the initial community and characters.  Should we not reach our goal, it will be disappointing, but several other avenues of funding, including an SBA loan are being pursued.</li>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>This is a concept that parents and grandparents can trust, and have no doubts about it including questionable or morally unacceptable content.   Kids will be glued to the website learning about dinosaurs, following the stories and activities of the characters with new content created every week.<br/></p>
<p>In my current test group of children, ages 6 to 12, it has been DEMANDED of me to continue writing as many stories and songs as fast as I can.  <br/></p>

<p>      Personally, I have about $50,000 invested in this already, along with years of work.  My current ""greatest challenge"" is to get funding to finish the song album and produce it for marketing (2 more songs are needed about $8,000); have another generation of art rendered for the new website, album cover, story illustration, etc. (approx. $5,000); and then there is getting appropriate applications written for the dino game, so it can be online and cell. phone friendly.  We would like to get a short animation created for the website, too.<br/></p>

<p>Everything
from basic control to the cross platform GUI is written in Python and is
provided for free through the popular version control software Git on our public repository on GitHub. This allows and even encourages
people to look at the code, modify it, and share what they have done with it to the world.</p>
<p>By design CoroBot Spark chassis and accessories were designed to be reproduced on a laser cutter and 3D printers, tools that are typically available at local Makerspaces, Techshops, and even some
schools. Don't have access to these tools? We will still provide the entire kit to
be purchased.</p>
<p><b>How can you help?</b></p>
<p>Even if you aren't
interested in getting a CoroBot Spark kit for yourself but believe in our
vision of providing better educational tools to students, by contributing even
the smallest donation of $5, $10, or $10,000 will go a LONG way towards helping
those who need our help the most. By contributing to this campaign, you are
standing with us in helping students of the future get the tools they need to
tackle the problems of tomorrow.</p>
<p>By contributing in
whatever fashion you can, it will help us in develop not only the hardware
related with this project but also the free and open software, educational
materials, and even help support future outreach events &amp; projects. Not
only will your support help us getting this project off the ground and into the
real world, but it will also let us know that we are on the right path and
there are others who believe in our vision.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Powered by Python </b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Not
only will the CoroBot Spark be powered by Python but each Debian image will
come preloaded with powerful tools like Anaconda, SciPy, iPython Notebook, and
many other great tools. These are software packages designed to be powerful
enough to manipulate any data set of nearly any size and quickly, making the
CoroBot Spark a valuable tool for teaching subjects like Mathematics, Computer
Science, and about AI. If you ever have issues with the software on the CoroBot
Spark, this same software image will be available online through the CoroBot
Spark GitHub account which makes reseting the units back to ""factory"" settings a breeze.</p>
<p><b>Kit Contents:</b></p>
<p>Unlike all of the robotics platforms out there that you see today that use the Raspberry Pi or Arduino as the primary platform, the CoroBot Spark provides everything you need to build a powerful robot straight out of the box. At the very core of the Spark is the CoroBot Pi Hat, a fully engineered Pi Hat that combines motor drivers, powerful microcontrollers, servo drivers, and so much more into a single board that doesn't require ANY breadboarding, jumper wires, and NO FRUSTRATION. It's all designed to be plug and play. </p>

<p>Driving the powerful CoroBot Pi Hat is the latest and greatest offering from the Raspberry Pi Foundation, the Raspberry Pi 2.

<p>Included with each full kit are 4 small yet powerful metal geared motors, front facing ultrasonic sensors, pan/tilt mechanism for the Pi Camera, and IR distance sensors.</p>

<p>
</p>
<p><b>Hardware specifics: </b></p>
<p>The
CoroBot Spark is primarily powered by the Raspberry Pi 2 which handles much of
the higher level computing for tasks like machine vision and path planning
algorithms. Supporting the Raspberry Pi, is our custom developed Pi Hat which
uses a combination of the PSoC 5LP and PSoC 4 (4200 Series). The beauty of the
PSoC from Cypress is that it features the power of digitally reprogrammable
logic. This means that you can customize which pins do what on the fly. This is
very similar to how an FPGA works, but with the simplicity and power of a
microcontroller. </p>

<br/>
<p>For
sensors, the CoroBot Spark comes fully equipped with two front facing
ultrasonic sensors, a front facing IR sensor, the Raspberry Pi Camera mounted
on a pan/tilt mechanism, and then a rear facing ultrasonic sensor. All of which
plugs directly into the Pi Hat, leaving almost all of the Raspberry Pi GPIO and
additional Pi Hat pins available to be expanded upon. </p>
<p>Driving
the Spark are four independent DC motors with high power gear boxes. This
allows high control of each wheel as well as the potential to replace the
wheels with omni-directional wheels. </p>
<p>Any robot would be

<p><b>Risks and
challenges</b></p>
<p>As
professionals, planning for the unforeseen is what we do best. By leveraging
the professional experience of the CoroWare Robotics Solutions group, we are
confident after successful funding of the CoroBot Spark project will only have
three main risks:</p>
<p>1)
Large scale production: We have already built numerous prototypes that have
been tested by engineers along the way but things can change once they have
been scaled up. This is why we have partnered with specialists who specialize
in automated PCB manufacturing and large production laser cutting services.
Luckily by being physically near these companies, we can resolve issues quickly
when they arise.</p>
<p>2)
Fulfillment: By being in the business of developing robotic platforms for
business and academic research, we don't ship things until they have been fully
tested and know that they will work straight out of the box. This is why we
have built into our fabrication processes, testing procedures to ensure that
each kit delivered is like the next, perfect.</p>
<p>3)
Software Support: The last major risk is software support. This is why the
entire project has been focused on developing a robot based upon Python, one of
the fastest growing programming languages that is both easy to use and
extremely powerful! Secondly, by combining a full time engineering staff with
an open source project that will be openly available via GitHub, problems, if

 had so much fun at these events, we wanted to make these sorts of 
virtual experiences available to everyone, everyday. We also realized 
there was a massive talent pool of developers in Melbourne with the 
skills and the desire to create the ""next big thing"" but lacked access 
to the latest hardware solutions.<br/><br/>What if we had space filled 
with the latest in virtual reality and augmented reality hardware and 
software?  A hardware library for enthusiasts to explore and for 
developers to test their ideas. A co-working space dedicated to the 
development of this brand new consumer medium.<br/><br/>We began this 
IndieGoGo with this idea, the passion and the hope we could find like 
minded people to make such a project reality. Then we met the guys at 
Revolver Creative and <b>""The VR Den"" </b>was born...<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1304697/files/20150318024500-20150318_142916_resized.jpg?1426671900"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/>
<h3>A home for cutting edge technology...
</h3><p>Sometimes getting access to the latest hardware can be the biggest 
challenge, especially in Australia. We have built many relationships in 
the emerging Virtual Reality space, so by having this physical location 
we will be able to offer manufacturers a space to showcase their latest 
hardware and for enthusiasts to test drive equipment otherwise not 
available locally.

11/03/2015 - What's in a name?
16/03/2015 - Attention Flight Sim Enthusiasts...
19/03/2015 - Announcing ""The VR Den""
20/03/2015 - Thanks to our sponsors...

We make Virtual Experiences Infinity Amusements started its life manufacturing Virtual 
Pinball machines, but as we're all geeks here, it wasn't long before we 
started incorporating our love of virtual reality into the overall 
business. So far we have built and run the following VR experiences for 
expos and events: 
Backlot Theatre preshow Horror Experience
GO Festival 2014 - VR Experience
Samsung Island VR Bike Ride Experience
Bupa Challenge ""Santos Tour Down Under"" Experience
GO Festival 2015 - Gaming Zone
People
 had so much fun at these events, we wanted to make these sorts of 
virtual experiences available to everyone, everyday. We also realized 
there was a massive talent pool of developers in Melbourne with the 
skills and the desire to create the ""next big thing"" but lacked access 
to the latest hardware solutions.What if we had space filled 
with the latest in virtual reality and augmented reality hardware and 
software?  A hardware library for enthusiasts to explore and for 
developers to test their ideas. A co-working space dedicated to the 
development of this brand new consumer medium.We began this 
IndieGoGo with this idea, the passion and the hope we could find like 
minded people to make such a project reality. Then we met the guys at 
Revolver Creative and ""The VR Den"" was born...
A home for cutting edge technology...
Sometimes getting access to the latest hardware can be the biggest 
challenge, especially in Australia. We have built many relationships in 
the emerging Virtual Reality space, so by having this physical location 
we will be able to offer manufacturers a space to showcase their latest 
hardware and for enthusiasts to test drive equipment otherwise not 
available locally.



Why now? Virtual Reality has been ""coming"" for years with the Oculus 
Rift Kickstarter marking the true beginning of the consumer VR 
revolution. We've been developing in the space for about 18 months now 
and have amassed the following gear: 
3 x Oculus Rift DK2 Virtual Reality headsets
1 x Samsung Gear VR
2 x Gaming Grade PC's
Next Level Racing motion simulator with swappable Logitech G25 racing controls or the Thrustmaster A-10 Warthog HOTAS.
Static simulator with Thrustmaster HOTAS-X or Saitek Yoke/Pedal 
flight controls. Suitable for flight experiences and non-interactive 
experiences (ie rollercoasters, ghost trains)
A boat load of software
Microsoft Kinect V1 with various cloud-point scanning programs
Leap Motion tracking sensor
6 x 1080p action cams for 3D or 360 video recording
We can only work on so many projects at once, so we thought why not make
 all of this gear available to both the general public and fellow 
developers.When the team at SimPit NZ heard about what we 
were planning they made us a very special offer. Would you like to 
experience a HD virtual environment, with full 180 degree field of view without a HMD? The Icarus Avenger makes that a reality... And
 we will have the only one of it's kind in Australia. If you're a fan of
 flight simulators and you're not excited yet - better check that pulse.The VR Den will be an extension to the resources at Revolver 
Creative (RC) - a dedicated space for the exploration and development of
 virtual reality technology and solutions. We're on track to open to the public shortly after Easter (April 2015).What's next? Over the next 6 months we have the following equipment on its way:
Virtuix Omni VR treadmill
Sixense STEM full body tracking
More cloud-point recording software and hardware solutions
A few super special secrets. We'd tell you, but we'd have to kill you.



Why an open campaign? 
We have already invested in enough equipment to establish The VR Den and run our trial, so we've split the campaign into two stages:


Step One: A Place to Play - Secure our space at Revolver Creative and make Chapel St, Melbourne the capital of virtual reality.

Step Two: Additional Equipment: There is nothing like competing 
against your mates. All funds raised beyond this point will go towards 
additional HMDs, treadmills, motion-simulators, etc so we can offer 2, 3 
or 4 player experiences and test environments.What are our funding goals?

$4600 - Secure our space at Revolver Creative for a further six months
$5600 - Add a third gaming grade PC for running a third DK2
$6600 -  Add a second Virtuix Omni VR treadmill
$10,000 - Add a secomd Next Level Motion Platform

<p>FindYourTrip is an educative game on IOS Ipad designed for kids
from 6 to 10 years old. The player's goal in FindYourTrip is to free cities that have been invaded by Pumas. To do so, the player will have to help Messi the monkey by outsmarting pumas who kidnapped his friends. Not only kids will be able to improve their education, but they will discover countries all around the world through real life shot videos designed by our team from Youtube. In addition, FindYourTrip will display information about the local culture.</p><p>FindYourTrip creates the perfect environment and attraction
so that your children can learn while having fun. Studies
have found that when a child feels more comfortable in an environment, learning experience will be better. The best way to make kids practicing is to make them discover by being amazed of what they can find out. We have setup FindYourTrip in one
of the biggest and most beautiful cities in the world, Bangkok Thailand.</p><p><i></i></p><h3><i><i>Parents will be able to control their kids progress without them to notice they are being tested.</i></i></h3><div>The purpose of FindYourTrip is to offer and content both parents and kids. Kids will learn through having a funny experience by discovering. In parents side, FindYourTrip will be a tool to assess their kids' progress INSTANTLY by receiving a complete report.

Game designWe've created FindYourTrip with the best technologies available on the market in order to maximize kid's gaming experience.



Unity 3D: One of the best engine to code a game on the market. Famous and popular games already use this technology (Assassin's Creed Identity, Clash of Clans, Endless Legend...)


Educational content: US standards in term of education have become world's standards. We have chosen this content from different sources to make sure your kids will learn in the best.


Graphic design: Using the most powerful software to design awesome graphic content, we have tried to create a familiar environment within the game. Both real and fancy animations will keep your mind into the game.


Videos: We have shot with Canon Mark III live scene of Bangkok locations. The kids while playing will be able to see what are the locations they are playing in reality.

We are trying with FindYourTrip to make education more fun. 



FindYourTrip is an educative game on IOS Ipad designed for kids
from 6 to 10 years old. The player's goal in FindYourTrip is to free cities that have been invaded by Pumas. To do so, the player will have to help Messi the monkey by outsmarting pumas who kidnapped his friends. Not only kids will be able to improve their education, but they will discover countries all around the world through real life shot videos designed by our team from Youtube. In addition, FindYourTrip will display information about the local culture.FindYourTrip creates the perfect environment and attraction
so that your children can learn while having fun. Studies
have found that when a child feels more comfortable in an environment, learning experience will be better. The best way to make kids practicing is to make them discover by being amazed of what they can find out. We have setup FindYourTrip in one
of the biggest and most beautiful cities in the world, Bangkok Thailand.Parents will be able to control their kids progress without them to notice they are being tested.The purpose of FindYourTrip is to offer and content both parents and kids. Kids will learn through having a funny experience by discovering. In parents side, FindYourTrip will be a tool to assess their kids' progress INSTANTLY by receiving a complete report. NOTE this function will be only available on v2 of the game.
Our history
We've started FindYourTrip in 2011, at the beginning it was during our square time. We wanted to create a game through which the player would travel and learn, and of course have fun.We tried a first beta on Samsung Smart TV, but failed in the fact the engine to code on the TV was hard to use at that time, and also because we had no resources after that. We gave up the project for almost one year, waiting for our audience to grow.After plenty of brainstorming, the project was changed. We have decided to launch FindYourTrip on Smartphones and Tablets because there was a real demand for education game.3 years later thanks to our improvements, Expara and an accelerator program [I4-X] gave us a chance to relaunch the project with a seed funding in Bangkok.What
about us?

Our team is
young and wiling to reach the sky to make this project come true! We have worked successfully between Bangkok and
Singapore for 4 years now
as part of a video online marketing startup (FindYourWayInTheWorld) created by our own.

We are
operating in the video online marketing field and have produced over than 200
videos for worldwide clients. According to this, we have acquiered strong
skills in online marketing compaign.Passionate
of videos and strongly believe that a video can speak more than words, we want
share our vision with our future players.
Some others
passionate teams has already joined us:
- 
Pinata a game development studio of Singapore (We
usually call them “the little genius”). Andy, Fa, and Raymond have supported all coding phase and testings.
- 
Red and Steve are both 3d creator/video
editing/graphic experts for 15 years in the industry (“The magicians”) have pushed the game to the next level!

</ul><h4>Technology in the Classroom -- Student Perspectives<br/>
</h4><p>  I think
that the one to one idea for next year is a fantastic idea. iPads will be an
incredible asset to our school as a whole. 
It would make it a lot easier to keep track of homework and due dates
because you can set reminders for it and you can do most of your work on the
iPad. It would be extremely easy to transfer homework, tests, quizzes, etc. to
the iPad.  <u>Also, I think this would
draw students to our school.  Not many
small Christian schools have a program like 1 to 1.</u></p><p>
</p><p><i>Austen, Junior, PPCS</i></p>
<p>  I think we
should have iPads in the classroom because it’s hands on learning, making what
you learn memorable.</p>
<p><i>Kaitlyn, Senior, PPCS</i></p>
<p>  I think we
need iPads because it allows us access to the Internet for learning on
educational websites.</p>
<p><i>Mark, Senior, PPCS</i></p>
<p>  In order
for Pikes Peak Christian to remain an effective learning environment that is
more advanced than a public school system, we need to keep up with the pace of
life and head in the direction of success. In college, using the Internet and
computers are a huge part of studying and staying ahead.  When we use iPads, we teach students to effectively
learn to use the web to aid them in finding information, and educate students
on modern programs used in school, professions, jobs, etc. (programs such as
Microsoft Office programs, iMovie, iPhoto and others).  The use of older, more outdated computers
holds us back; many local public schools here use Apple or Windows 8
systems.  Outdated technology is not used
in the business world.  </p>
<p><i>Effy, Senior, PPCS</i></p>
<p>  iPads allow
greater freedom of learning.  The power
of the internet has never been greater - accessing more information faster –
allowing each student to learn by hearing, seeing or typing notes.  Apps also allow faster calculations.  iPads are the future.</p>
<p><i>Nate, Senior, PPCS</i></p>
<p><i>  </i>Having iPads gives an advantage
to the school and students.  It makes
things quicker, like notes, studying and reading.</p>
<p><i>Shyanne, Sophomore, PPCS</i></p>
<p>I would love to have iPads for school next year.  It would help with my notes and studying and
having a lighter load to take home if books or textbooks were on the iPad.</p>
<p><i>Tristina, Sophomore, PPCS</i></p>
<p>  It would
attract more people to the school and more students means more funding, which
means higher budgets for this.  Having
iPads would also help students with studying because if they are out sick, they
can Facetime their teachers and get help with what they missed.  And finally, for foreign students, they could
have apps explain and help them comprehend more.  </p>
<p><i>Gabe, Freshman, PPCS</i></p>
<p>  We should
have iPads because they will give us many abilities like extra help and
language assistance. </p>
<p><i>Malora, Freshman, PPCS</i></p>
<p>  While many
fail to understand the modern world and its technology, within any workplace – in
which college degrees are required, use and understanding of technology is a
steadily growing requirement.  The neglect
of technology and use of it is a critical error.  Even with the neglect to do so and apply
technology – students will use their own appliances to answer homework and
school work.  </p>
<p><i>Mark, Junior, PPCS</i></p>
<p>  iPads may
sound like a waste of energy and money for the school.  You may think students wouldn’t benefit or
may just misuse the device. In reality, iPads will be one of the most used
tools you could give them.  I know from
experience that when you give us something and trust us to use it, we normally
want to prove to you we can do it.  We
all know how to use an iPad, we know how to use the applications, and if you
made things like a calculator, language translator, notepad, and any other tool
in one central place like an iPad, more kids would be more likely to do their
work.  We wouldn’t be bringing home a
bunch of books or work things; we’d just bring home the iPad. </p>
<p><i>Aspen, Junior, PPCS</i></p>
<p>  It will
give us time to work at our own speed, so as fast as we like or as slow as we
like, but we have to keep on a schedule. We have to learn the material, and we can
ask a question at our house instead of not doing it that night when we have
time.</p>
<p><i>Kenzie, 8<sup>th</sup> Grade, PPCS</i></p>
<p>  I truly believe that iPads could
change schools forever.  First off, iPads
are going to save us so much money on paper. We could use the money we save from not using
paper on the iPads.  Second, I think that
it’s going to get kids really excited about learning. Third, the iPads allow you to work at your own
pace.  I love the fact that the videos I
watch for math, I can fast forward or rewatch whenever I feel like it.  Lastly, I think it will help us kids
understand the importance of responsibility. 
Let’s be honest, having an iPad is work. 
You have to be sure you take care of it. 
I think this will prepare us for the real world! By the time I’m in the workforce, I’m pretty
sure we’re going have touch screen everything. 
Don’t you think it’s better that we learn about how to use this
technology now instead of when we’re adults? 
</p>
<p><i>Krista, 8<sup>th</sup> Grade, PPCS</i></p>
<p>  Having
iPads in the class would be convenient because it gives us a new way to
learn.  Lectures are kind of boring…it’s
nice to have something new.  Our hands
won’t hurt from writing notes and solving problems.  We can also experience the type of technology
we will be exposed to when we are older.</p>
<p><i>Ola, 8<sup>th</sup> Grade, PPCS</i></p>
<p>  It’s a
great idea to have iPads for school next year for several reasons.  It helps kids with the technology skills…when
going into a technology filled world.  It
gives an advantage to well-known sources for help.  You would be able to chat with teachers and
students for help or transfer work to students that are absent.</p>
<p><i>Jake, Junior, PPCS</i></p>
<p>  Even though
I will be graduating this year, I believe in bettering the learning system of
the students by going to 1-to-1.  As the
world advances, teens rely more and more on technology – what better method of
learning than having individual tablets to experiment with?  <u>I believe that having individual tablets
would be extremely attractive to teens considering PPCS.  I hope to see this school grow abundantly in
the future.</u>  </p>

incredible asset to our school as a whole. 
It would make it a lot easier to keep track of homework and due dates
because you can set reminders for it and you can do most of your work on the
iPad. It would be extremely easy to transfer homework, tests, quizzes, etc. to
the iPad.  Also, I think this would
draw students to our school.  Not many
small Christian schools have a program like 1 to 1.
Austen, Junior, PPCS
  I think we
should have iPads in the classroom because it’s hands on learning, making what
you learn memorable.
Kaitlyn, Senior, PPCS
  I think we
need iPads because it allows us access to the Internet for learning on
educational websites.
Mark, Senior, PPCS
  In order
for Pikes Peak Christian to remain an effective learning environment that is
more advanced than a public school system, we need to keep up with the pace of
life and head in the direction of success. In college, using the Internet and
computers are a huge part of studying and staying ahead.  When we use iPads, we teach students to effectively
learn to use the web to aid them in finding information, and educate students
on modern programs used in school, professions, jobs, etc. (programs such as
Microsoft Office programs, iMovie, iPhoto and others).  The use of older, more outdated computers
holds us back; many local public schools here use Apple or Windows 8
systems.  Outdated technology is not used
in the business world.  
Effy, Senior, PPCS
  iPads allow
greater freedom of learning.  The power
of the internet has never been greater - accessing more information faster –
allowing each student to learn by hearing, seeing or typing notes.  Apps also allow faster calculations.  iPads are the future.
Nate, Senior, PPCS
  Having iPads gives an advantage
to the school and students.  It makes
things quicker, like notes, studying and reading.
Shyanne, Sophomore, PPCS
I would love to have iPads for school next year.  It would help with my notes and studying and
having a lighter load to take home if books or textbooks were on the iPad.
Tristina, Sophomore, PPCS
  It would
attract more people to the school and more students means more funding, which
means higher budgets for this.  Having
iPads would also help students with studying because if they are out sick, they
can Facetime their teachers and get help with what they missed.  And finally, for foreign students, they could
have apps explain and help them comprehend more.  
Gabe, Freshman, PPCS
  We should
have iPads because they will give us many abilities like extra help and
language assistance. 
Malora, Freshman, PPCS
  While many
fail to understand the modern world and its technology, within any workplace – in
which college degrees are required, use and understanding of technology is a
steadily growing requirement.  The neglect
of technology and use of it is a critical error.  Even with the neglect to do so and apply
technology – students will use their own appliances to answer homework and
school work.  
Mark, Junior, PPCS
  iPads may
sound like a waste of energy and money for the school.  You may think students wouldn’t benefit or
may just misuse the device. In reality, iPads will be one of the most used
tools you could give them.  I know from
experience that when you give us something and trust us to use it, we normally
want to prove to you we can do it.  We
all know how to use an iPad, we know how to use the applications, and if you
made things like a calculator, language translator, notepad, and any other tool
in one central place like an iPad, more kids would be more likely to do their
work.  We wouldn’t be bringing home a
bunch of books or work things; we’d just bring home the iPad. 
Aspen, Junior, PPCS
  It will
give us time to work at our own speed, so as fast as we like or as slow as we
like, but we have to keep on a schedule. We have to learn the material, and we can
ask a question at our house instead of not doing it that night when we have
time.
Kenzie, 8th Grade, PPCS
  I truly believe that iPads could
change schools forever.  First off, iPads
are going to save us so much money on paper. We could use the money we save from not using
paper on the iPads.  Second, I think that
it’s going to get kids really excited about learning. Third, the iPads allow you to work at your own
pace.  I love the fact that the videos I
watch for math, I can fast forward or rewatch whenever I feel like it.  Lastly, I think it will help us kids
understand the importance of responsibility. 
Let’s be honest, having an iPad is work. 
You have to be sure you take care of it. 
I think this will prepare us for the real world! By the time I’m in the workforce, I’m pretty
sure we’re going have touch screen everything. 
Don’t you think it’s better that we learn about how to use this
technology now instead of when we’re adults? 

Krista, 8th Grade, PPCS
  Having
iPads in the class would be convenient because it gives us a new way to
learn.  Lectures are kind of boring…it’s
nice to have something new.  Our hands
won’t hurt from writing notes and solving problems.  We can also experience the type of technology
we will be exposed to when we are older.
Ola, 8th Grade, PPCS
  It’s a
great idea to have iPads for school next year for several reasons.  It helps kids with the technology skills…when
going into a technology filled world.  It
gives an advantage to well-known sources for help.  You would be able to chat with teachers and
students for help or transfer work to students that are absent.
Jake, Junior, PPCS
  Even though
I will be graduating this year, I believe in bettering the learning system of
the students by going to 1-to-1.  As the
world advances, teens rely more and more on technology – what better method of
learning than having individual tablets to experiment with?  I believe that having individual tablets
would be extremely attractive to teens considering PPCS.  I hope to see this school grow abundantly in
the future.

Before a child even starts primary school, she will be able to use her 
mom's smartphone to learn her numbers and letters. Software will be able
 to see when she's having trouble with the material and adjust for her 
pace. Of course, software will never replace teachers. But by allowing 
teachers to do things like upload videos of themselves and get feedback 
from their peers, it can connect them in new ways.
What
 will it take to make sure life really does improve faster for the poor?
 We need advances in technology and we need to deliver them to the 
people who need them most. We also need to close the gender gap. 
Countries where girls don't go to school or women can't open a business 
will be left behind. We can build this online platform so that girls only need internet access to learn. 

""Countries where girls don't go to school or women can't open a business will be left behind.""
Bill and Melinda Gates

""It is time that we all see gender as a spectrum instead of 
two sets of opposing ideals. We should stop defining each other by what 
we are not, and start defining ourselves by who we are. [...]
I want men to take up this mantle so their 
daughters, sisters and mothers can be free from prejudice but also so 
their sons have permission to be vulnerable and human, too and in doing 
so, be a more true and complete version of themselves.""Emma Watson at the United Nations""There is an ironic, philosophical gap between the creative idealism of 
the startup industry and the investors who fund them. Our industry, with
 its insatiable appetite for ideas that will ‘change the world,’ is 
stuck in a traditional paradigm that does a regrettable disservice to 
the industry it claims to support.""-

<h3><strong>What we need &amp; what you'll get in return</strong></h3>
<p>We are raising €6,000 (≈ 57 000 SEK) to pay for all costs at the Nordic Cannabis Conference. Along with the space rental, we must cover the cost of equipment, food, hired personell, accomodation, fees, guest &amp; admin costs etc.<br/><br/>Because of the subject of the event, NCC can't seek traditional funding here in the Nordic countries. Thus having to rely on private donations and sponsors, and that is where <strong>you</strong> as an individual can make a big difference. </p>
<p>If we do not reach our entire goal we will do our best to find a smaller/cheaper venue for this event. </p>
<p><strong>Cost Breakdown: </strong></p>
<p>• €1500 - 1,800 Space rental + cafeteria fees<br/><br/>• €500 Material &amp; Equipment t-shirts, flyers, posters, banners etc. <br/><br/>• €1500 Accomodation &amp; Travel expenses<br/><br/>• €2000 Guest &amp; Admin costs</p>

What we need & what you'll get in return
We are raising €6,000 (≈ 57 000 SEK) to pay for all costs at the Nordic Cannabis Conference. Along with the space rental, we must cover the cost of equipment, food, hired personell, accomodation, fees, guest & admin costs etc.Because of the subject of the event, NCC can't seek traditional funding here in the Nordic countries. Thus having to rely on private donations and sponsors, and that is where you as an individual can make a big difference. 
If we do not reach our entire goal we will do our best to find a smaller/cheaper venue for this event. 
Cost Breakdown: 
• €1500 - 1,800 Space rental + cafeteria fees• €500 Material & Equipment t-shirts, flyers, posters, banners etc. • €1500 Accomodation & Travel expenses• €2000 Guest & Admin costs
We also have perks for our contributors which include things such as signed stickers, cups, t-shirts and reserved front row tickets to the event.
Other Ways You Can Help
We appreciate everyone's hard earned money and understand that not everyone can contribute financially. So if you like the project, feel free to spread the word on your blogs, social media, among friends or if just come to the actual event :)  About Us  Guerilla Tactics Entertainment is an independent production team that first came to light in 2014. We specialize in thought-provoking, entertaining multimedia, with a focus on telling different stories in unique ways and in a variety of genres that resonates with audiences both domestically and abroad.Sweden has always been well known to the rest of the world as a progressive, forward nation, bound to protect human rights and fight injustice on all aspects of life. Yet, Sweden harbours one of the most repressive and destructive drug policies in the Western world. With that comes a stigma and an entire society that is brainwashed into ""Reefer Madness"" maners and also ignorantly proud of their lack of knowledge when it comes to drugs. Cannabis is still considered a slippery slope to heroine addiction in Sweden and even with harsh fines and potential prison time for soft drugs, such as cannabis, Sweden still has more than 500 drug related deaths annually and a current spice (synthetic cannabis) epidemic. A direct result of the Swedish criminalization of cannabis.Sweden, a nation of 10 million inhabitants has roughly the same amount of heroin addicts as The Netherlands (ca 18 million inhabitants ), even though The Netherlands has one of the more liberal drug laws in the world. How is that possible?That is why we at Guerilla Tactics Entertainment has decided to arrange this first-time, and hopefully annual, event together with the largest Swedish Cannabis Movement, ""Avkriminalisera Cannabis"" (Decriminalize Cannabis) to raise awareness and educate the Nordic people. The event will be completely free to attend for everyone and we'll hope to see you September 23 in Malmö",2.0,0,"6 Campaigns

<p>Hello! </p>
<p>This is Egle and  Gintare. We are two creative souls who grew up  in small town Rumsiskes in the middle of Lithuania. After studies, traveling. many life lessons and experiences, we came back to our homelands.  We both have 6 years of experience working with kids. Children's Garden idea is around for a while and finally we have the chance to make this dream come true. We kindly ask you to be part of it!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Children's Garden is proposed to be a natural learning environment for children aged 2 years old and above located in the beautiful countryside near capital Vilnius.  At its heart is our desire for young ones to experience and explore Lithuanian traditions and heritage. We want to create a space where children can gain knowledge about Lithuanian heritage by spending time learning and playing in spaces that reflect Lithuanian traditions. We want to encourage their curiosity about the culture from which they come.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Children will be able to choose from a variety of activities and experiences while immersed in a traditional Lithuanian country setting. We will provide natural materials such as flax, clay, wood, and stones as well as tools and guidance under trained supervisors to help them explore their imagination and creativity, all while forming lifelong friendships in a positive learning atmosphere. Traditional artists and craftspeople will make goods and teach skills so that all children can learn at their own pace while exploring what it means to be Lithuanian.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our ethos stems from an aversion to 'Helicopter Parenting', where parents who take an overprotective or excessive interest in the life of their children can leave them lifelong issues around the fear of new things, general anxiety and dependence issues later in life, as well as a lack of basic life skills. While we would of course adhere to safety standards and proper supervision and training requirements, the main focus would be on nurturing what the children choose to experience for themselves, therefore allowing them the independence to explore their individual talents and curiosities. The goal is for children to leave the garden equipped with a stronger sense of self-confidence as they mature further in life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lithuania is currently experiencing issues involving heavy emigration resulting in the threat of a loss of cultural identity. Many young people have left the country to seek better opportunities elsewhere. Even those who have stayed have typically moved to the main cities and therefore lost touch with the countryside. As the next generation is raised, who will pass on the traditions and sense of cultural heritage?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Children's Garden will have:</p>
<p>1. A day care with provision for children aged 2-6 years old</p>
<p>2. Holiday day camps catering for older children</p>
<p>3. Summer camps for those children who may have grown up in cities or abroad and have lost touch with their heritage and ancestry</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There is so much potential to create such a space with all these learning possibilities and experiences! As those little ones can’t wait to get started with us - this is why we need your help!</p>
<p>Your support will:</p>
<p>1. allow to provide children care for those in need and those who needs to get back to the roots of their culture!</p>
<p>2. promote and support local artists (perks you will get are handmade)</p>
<p>3. allow children to try out materials from the nature promoting growing them environmental-friendly spirit</p>
<p>What we have so far:</p>
<p>1. A country house with land (16a) passed down through familial generations located in a beautiful countryside setting</p>
<p>2. Access to knowledge and skills through artisans and craftspeople of traditional Lithuanian heritage and activities</p>
<p>3. A passion for independent and group learning through direct interaction with real working tools and materials</p>
<p>4. A love of creating and passing on a sense of one's roots from a young age as a basis for continuing to develop through one's life</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our 'To-Do' list:</p>
<p>1. We really need to fix up the house in order to provide a suitable indoor learning space for the children. The main issues include replacing and updating the roof, heating system, windows and doors.</p>
<p>2. We would love to build an outdoor kitchen for our lovely summer weather and for the children to experience traditional outdoor cooking</p>
<p>3. We will create secure learning spaces and environments in which children can play, learn and explore; each with a unique focus such as  the pottery corner, the veggie garden, the greenhouse and hopefully one day a small animal house too.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your time, donation and interest. If you believe in this dream with me - please share this page with your friends! </p>

Each act of support is warmly received and appreciated by us.A little bit about ourselves:In July 2014 we took part in the International Citizen Service program with Tearfund, which changed all our lives and impacted us positively. In a team of Rwandans and UK volunteers, we worked day by day to help vulnerable people to lift themselves out of poverty in 10 weeks (Team Video) .Afterwards, Jean Luc Habimana and myself were lucky to win ICV Alumni Grant from Tearfund that helped start a project called “the Green Saves”, with the help of our two colleagues. The project helped the beneficiaries who were the occupants of refugee camp to start a new life, through training them about self-help groups (which help them to save from whatever they have, use the savings in resolving their own problems and give them the opportunity to start small businesses), nutrition and making kitchen gardens (more about the Green Saves Project is available here).Today, Jean Luc and I with other colleagues have a social organization called MyStory that uses stories to inspire, connect and enable young people to bring their dreams to life through telling motivating stories and bringing people together and we were lucky to be selected to represent Rwanda at the 19th World Festival of Youth and Students in Sochi, Russia this October (one week to go).This is an amazing opportunity to share inspirational stories on a global youth platform and also bring those stories back to Rwanda, as well as having open discussions on global issues.For this to happen we need a support in covering traveling costs to and from the event venue.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>About AMUN</h3>
<p>AMUN is an opportunity for Albanian youth to expand their horizons. This is a meaningful experience for students in a country that up until 25 years ago, had closed borders. This campaign is dedicated to help fund the costs of holding regional conferences where students will demonstrate the skills they have been working on throughout the year.</p>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<div>
<p>AMUN is making this program as sustainable as possible through a student led local fundraising for transportation costs, and by partnering with local organizations like the Ministry of Education and NGOs. This year AMUN has partnered with the English Language Teachers Association of Albania - ELTA.</p>
<p>Students fund raise their way to the final conference but fundraising is not a common concept here in Albania, and can only cover a portion of the costs. Funding from this campaign will go towards transportation costs for student delegations to their regional and final conferences, as well as small conference needs such as snacks and printing costs. The venues are generously donated by local organizations and those moderating the conferences donate their time.</p>
<p>The first regional conference allows students to practice the unique structure and debate of MUN. Between the first and second regional conference, students reflect on their performance in the first conference and find ways to improve for the second conference. By the final conference, it becomes a true, spirited debate and collaboration for the more seasoned students to achieve resolutions and present solutions to current problems affecting the world today. In addition to the fundraising component, students also participate in:</p>
<p>• A community project that allows students to engage their local communities in the spirit of education and opportunity, while practicing skills like public speaking and community outreach</p>
<p>• A social media competition to raise awareness to other Albanian youth and get them excited about current issues. All the funds collected will go towards putting on the MUN conferences.</p>
</div>
<div> </div>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will allow students to experience something quite different than anything else they have encountered. Students can gain many important skills that aren't presently taught in the Albanian Education system. Albania is searching for its role in the world and these students truly are the future of Albania. Creating global citizens within the country is key to Albania’s success in a rapidly changing world.</p>
<p>AMUN is growing each year, and becoming more competitive as more schools and youth groups take notice. Groups that participated in previous years are extremely eager for the AMUN program to start up again, and those who were delegates and have graduated high school still reach out to find a way to continue to be a part of the program. It is a testament to the success of the program and the positive experience that students have year after year.</p>
<p>Risks &amp; Challenges</p>
</div><div>
<p>Lack of funding is the biggest challenge as transporting students from their towns and villages to conference venues is the most important and costly factor in putting on conferences.</p>
<p>We hope that we will be able to successfully reach our goal and fund these students' costs of conference participation. </p>

<h3>Paris Talks: The Project!</h3>
<p>After a little more than three years of community and event management, time has come for us to embrace brand new challenges.</p>
<p>Introducing <strong><a href=""https://paris-talks.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PARIS TALKS</a></strong>:</p>
<p>Paris Talks is a conference done in the form of short, powerful, inspiring talks (15 minutes or less), entertainment, and networking opportunities.</p>
<p>It’s a one-day gathering for decision-makers, artists, entrepreneurs, inventors, scientists, educators, futurists, environmentalists, economists, visionaries and any curious people out there.</p>
<p>This platform is a place where you’ll hear and learn about promising new findings, ideas and approaches on how to deal with some of the world’s toughest current and future challenges related to <strong>economics, finance, science, art, design, education, technology, environment</strong> and so much more.</p>
<p>Paris Talks will take place in March 2018 in Paris and will be done entirely in English.</p>
<p>After brainstorming for more than 12 months, designing the website, defining the conference’s vision, theme, and area of focus, time has arrived to get you involved.</p>
<h2>
<strong>What's the long-term impact of this </strong><strong>campaign?</strong>
</h2>
</div><div>
<p>We really want this project to be a success and by backing us, you’ll have contributed enormously in creating:</p>
<ol>
<li>A platform that deals with serious issues that need to be re-examined</li>
<li>The one and only platform that deals with issues related to the Future of our universe in Paris, France and in entirely done in English.</li>
<li>A platform that doesn’t aim at predicting the future but rather warning and reminding us of the best and sustainable actions, to get involved into right now, to ensure a better future for the coming generations.</li>
<li>A platform where experts and influencers in different fields will meet to network, learn and challenge each other to look at the future of our world with an unconventional eye.</li>
<li>The Place where people from different walks of life, with the thirst for knowledge and the passion of inspiring others, can meet. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491815578/amziheqcq2rxwuaopwrh.png"" src=""""/>
</li>
</ol>
</div><div>
<h3>What's the need...</h3>
<p>Paris Talks will be an annual event, and the goal is that this conference will fund and sustain itself moving forward, but the nature of it being the first edition means <strong>we need a little help</strong> with seed money for up-front expenses such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Securing the venue,</li>
<li>Making deposits for keynote speakers (they’ll be announced soon)</li>

</div><p><i>Paris Talks, Fixing The Future.</i></p></div>","Paris Talks: The Project!
After a little more than three years of community and event management, time has come for us to embrace brand new challenges.
Introducing PARIS TALKS:
Paris Talks is a conference done in the form of short, powerful, inspiring talks (15 minutes or less), entertainment, and networking opportunities.
It’s a one-day gathering for decision-makers, artists, entrepreneurs, inventors, scientists, educators, futurists, environmentalists, economists, visionaries and any curious people out there.
This platform is a place where you’ll hear and learn about promising new findings, ideas and approaches on how to deal with some of the world’s toughest current and future challenges related to economics, finance, science, art, design, education, technology, environment and so much more.
Paris Talks will take place in March 2018 in Paris and will be done entirely in English.
After brainstorming for more than 12 months, designing the website, defining the conference’s vision, theme, and area of focus, time has arrived to get you involved.

What's the long-term impact of this campaign?


We really want this project to be a success and by backing us, you’ll have contributed enormously in creating:

A platform that deals with serious issues that need to be re-examined
The one and only platform that deals with issues related to the Future of our universe in Paris, France and in entirely done in English.
A platform that doesn’t aim at predicting the future but rather warning and reminding us of the best and sustainable actions, to get involved into right now, to ensure a better future for the coming generations.
A platform where experts and influencers in different fields will meet to network, learn and challenge each other to look at the future of our world with an unconventional eye.
The Place where people from different walks of life, with the thirst for knowledge and the passion of inspiring others, can meet. 



What's the need...
Paris Talks will be an annual event, and the goal is that this conference will fund and sustain itself moving forward, but the nature of it being the first edition means we need a little help with seed money for up-front expenses such as:

Securing the venue,
Making deposits for keynote speakers (they’ll be announced soon)
And Marketing campaign (printing, postage, advertising costs)

So, here’s the thing: Whether we meet our goal or not, any funds raised through this campaign will be an immediate and incredible jump-start for the conference.

<p>In March of 2016, the OKE Love, Peace, and Light Foundation teamed up with private individuals, and the Embassy of Switzerland in Nigeria/Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation to address the lack of water and sanitation facilities in the school, collapsing ceilings, dilapidated floors, presence of a community dumpsite on the school premises, and rundown appearance of the school buildings, plus overcrowded and ill equipped classrooms.

<p> </p>
<p>Thus far, over the course of 2016, we have completed the clean up of the waste site, construction of toilet facilities, creation of a borehole for clean water, and started ceiling and floor work on classrooms.

This school serves 600 students who have been struggling in overcrowded and poorly equipped classrooms and a difficult school environment generally.

<p>Hi my name is Steven Edwards I am the parent of two mixed raced boys. Seven years ago my elder son (who is now 14)  came home from school  and asked  me a question I was not really prepared for . He said “Some of the children said they were Indian and others said they were African but they said I am neither and nobody. Daddy what am I?” and I replied “Son you are beautiful”.  I then proceeded to tell him a story entitled “Six of One Half a Dozen of the Other. “  It’s a story of a fish called <strong>JOEY</strong> whose mother was a rainbow trout and father was a Barracuda.  Without giving too much of it away, at the end of the story his reply was  “Daddy I know what I am now , I am beautiful!”</p>
<p>This has been <u><strong>a long six year journey </strong></u>. We've just finished illustrating and editing the book. But we need your help in getting it printed and 11 minutes of the digital version animated. In this volatile time of race talk and race relations, I want you to help me to send a message throughout the world that “<strong>LOVE CONQUERS ALL</strong>”. No matter your color, class or creed together we can make this world a better place for our children.  A place where they are free to be themselves, and do that which they were created for.</p>
<p><strong>We want to partner with you to accomplish the following:</strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Purchase ISBN numbers to create several formats of the book </i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Print, Market and Distribute the first 10 000 copies.</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Create the digital version with 11 minutes of animation</i></strong></p>

<p><strong>The book has been written, illustrated and edited, talent has been sourced we just need you, to  add the missing piece of the puzzle.​<i>​</i></strong></p>
<p>When I tried to do this, six years ago it was ten times as much. It was virtually impossible, but with the technological advancements and crowd funding opportunities made since then, the time is now.</p>
<p>Whether it’s five dollars or five thousand we are grateful for every cent that would be given in support of this project.

<h3>   THE 12 AND UNDER SUPER COOL POETRY OPEN MIC!! </h3>
<p>King Thomas Moore is the youngest Knight Arts Foundation Award Winner in History. He's a 10 year old poet, and he is on a mission to create a space that supports youth voices.  He created and hosts <strong>The 12 and Under Super Cool Poetry Open Mic!</strong>!  Now he has to raise 15k to match his grant award.  The 12 and Under Super Cool Poetry Open Mic is an open mic and workshop series geared toward children under 12 year old!  We have partnered with The Motown Museum to kick off our poetry workshops in MAY for all children who sign up!  A series of workshops will help build up the writing and exposure to poetry to our elementary aged youth. King  created a fun, educational space for his friends and peers to be able to express themselves fully.  He's already doing the work, he just needs  funds to pay for the full program and help us market at home and across the country. </p>
<p>Who are you supporting? </p>
<p>Our Kids!  The money raised will help us publish an anthology of the Super Cool Poets work.  It will also help us produce an exciting  culminating event at a large cultural institution in the city.  It will help us pay for t-shirts, bags, pens, notebooks,  (cool literacy swag) etc, and also allow us to pay  our workshop facilitators and the spaces to do this important youth driven literacy work, fueled by the vision of a 10 year old budding poet and youth leader. </p>
</div><div>
<p>This project is valuable to my son, because he has been empowered by writing and reading poetry and he wants other children his age to have this same experience together in a safe place.  King has performed his work all over the country, and is becoming more confident in the process.  We've been getting beautiful turn outs and feedback every time we produce the event.</p>
<p>""<i>As a professional poet and book publisher, I have been inspired so much by the vision of my young son.  He has a big heart and I'm loving watching him grow and become a void-filler at such a young age.  I hope that you can help us reach this goal, as we want to get to work with the first set of workshops and getting SUPER COOL participants signed up for  summer classes.  The open mic is already headed to Gallery 992 in  Atlanta, GA  as a part of a major arts and literature festival.  </i></p>
<p><i>Supporting this effort, could just mean sharing it with someone who can make a donation, or a corporate entity that may want to help us buy gift bags or ice cream for our young poets.

</li> </ul> </div> </div>","If you believe in the importance of expanding awareness of the 
repression of LGBTI people in 76+ countries with anti-gay laws, please 
support the work of Erasing 76 Crimes and its French-language companion, 76 Crimes en français. The
 blogs focus on the human toll of those countries’ anti-gay laws and on 
the struggle to repeal them. As part of that work, we publish a list of hundreds of LGBTI people currently in prison or awaiting trial on homosexuality-related charges, a sad tally of LGBTI people murdered worldwide and an archive of positive articles about progress toward equality and fair treatment.You can contribute directly through this site, or make a U.S. tax-deductible contribution through the St. Paul’s Foundation for International Reconciliation website.
 (On the foundation's site, specify “Erasing 76 Crimes Blog” in the 
drop-down menu on the lower half of the page under the heading “Donated 
For.”)Please share this appeal with friends and colleagues who also might want to support truthful reporting about the status of LGBTI people worldwide. The blogs’ publisher, editors and reporters all work on a
 volunteer basis. Only the reporters receive any money, and that is 
limited to reimbursement of expenses. Those include costs such as bus 
fare to reach locations where LGBTI defendants have been imprisoned for 
their sexual orientation, telecommunication costs, and sometimes the 
price of a soft drink for a government official who otherwise won’t 
agree to be interviewed. The editors of the blog have paid those
 expenses from our pockets, supplemented by very modest earnings from 
sales of the blog’s book “From Wrongs to Gay Rights.”  Now
 we are offering you the opportunity to contribute to this quest for 
justice for LGBTI people. What will you receive in return for your 
donation? Realization that you are helping to pay the reporting expenses incurred by each of the writers of articles on the website. In addition, for contributions of $150 or more, you will receive: • A signed copy of the book “From Wrongs to Gay Rights.” Your
 donations will support the continued work of the blog’s reporting team 
and, if possible, will allow us to expand our news coverage to 
additional repressive countries and perhaps even replace the inadequate,
 aging equipment that our best volunteer reporters are using. 
Thank you from everyone at Erasing 76 Crimes on behalf of the harassed, 
repressed, stigmatized and imprisoned LGBTI people of the world.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, I’m Al Arevalo, the inventor/founder of Straptie.  The basis of design for the Straptie started with a simple observation.  With over 10,000 hours of soccer coaching experience, I noticed a continual issue with players’ footwear.  No matter what make or model laces loosened during play or were not properly tied. Efficiency,repetition, and progression are paramount in player formation...that all goes out the window when a player has improper cleats secured to their feet. For the more experienced players, loose laces not only create a physical impediment during play, but create a psychological disturbance. Posture, confidence, attention, and player formation as a whole diminishes with loose footwear. </p>
<p>My simple observation was further validated when watching a professional soccer game and noticed TWO players kneel down to retie their laces during play. I started to think about a potential solution to this problem, and a few months later the Straptie was born.  </p>
<p>Modern sports footwear technology is trying to do away with laces, however, in high pivoting sports like soccer, lacrosse, rugby, and football the foot needs to have minimal movement inside the boot. This means the footwear should not stretch &amp; feel like a snug glove. Rather, it needs to be secure and feel like taped up boxing gloves. </p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with laces. It's the dreaded knot that needs to be eliminated and thats exactly what I did!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have done diligent work in testing and choosing the best materials with the elite player in mind. In doing so, we have a great quality product and all the pieces are in place to proudly manufacture the Straptie here in the USA. To do so, however, we need quantities to catapult production.</p>
<p>My parents emigrated from Bolivia when I was a young child to achieve the American dream. I have a strong conviction with everything in place to begin manufacturing  here in the U.S. We can't do it without your help. For supporting this endeavor we are offering you awesome early bird pricing.<span style=""font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;"">                                  </span></p>

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p> </p>
<div><b>Is this only for cleats?</b></div>
<div>No, Strapties wrap under the sole for to work with cleats but also wrap around the ankle/back part of high-top cleats and flats.  </div>
<div><b>What sports shoes use the Straptie</b></div>
<div>We have put Strapties on Soccer, Rugby, Lacrosse, and football cleats. They also work great on hightop wrestling shoes and high-tops of all sorts with tradition eyelet all the way up the shoe.</div>

</div><p> </p></div>","Short Summary
Hi, I’m Al Arevalo, the inventor/founder of Straptie.  The basis of design for the Straptie started with a simple observation.  With over 10,000 hours of soccer coaching experience, I noticed a continual issue with players’ footwear.  No matter what make or model laces loosened during play or were not properly tied. Efficiency,repetition, and progression are paramount in player formation...that all goes out the window when a player has improper cleats secured to their feet. For the more experienced players, loose laces not only create a physical impediment during play, but create a psychological disturbance. Posture, confidence, attention, and player formation as a whole diminishes with loose footwear. 
My simple observation was further validated when watching a professional soccer game and noticed TWO players kneel down to retie their laces during play. I started to think about a potential solution to this problem, and a few months later the Straptie was born.  
Modern sports footwear technology is trying to do away with laces, however, in high pivoting sports like soccer, lacrosse, rugby, and football the foot needs to have minimal movement inside the boot. This means the footwear should not stretch & feel like a snug glove. Rather, it needs to be secure and feel like taped up boxing gloves. 
There is nothing wrong with laces. It's the dreaded knot that needs to be eliminated and thats exactly what I did!


What We Need & What You Get
We have done diligent work in testing and choosing the best materials with the elite player in mind. In doing so, we have a great quality product and all the pieces are in place to proudly manufacture the Straptie here in the USA. To do so, however, we need quantities to catapult production.
My parents emigrated from Bolivia when I was a young child to achieve the American dream. I have a strong conviction with everything in place to begin manufacturing  here in the U.S. We can't do it without your help. For supporting this endeavor we are offering you awesome early bird pricing.                                  
Other Ways You Can Help
Gift a pair of Strapties to a loved one or friend. With our featured perk we guaranteed you will receive your Strapties in time for the holidays.

<p>My name is Agatha Maloda from Chamwino - Dodoma , Tanzania. I am a certificate holder of Marketing and a diploma holder of procurement and supply management from the College of Business Education. I am currently working with Chamwino Arts Center as a communication person and a Youth leader also working as a seasonal program leader with Rustic Pathways.</p>
<p>I have been working with youth from different countries for four years now, first as a youth volunteer in Bulgaria for the project Arts for social change with Chamwino Arts Center as a sending organization and Open space foundation as a hosting organization funded by Erasmus plus program of European union. I have also been working as a program leader with Rustic Pathways in Tanzania, Nepal and India. Participating in different international youth exchanges and different projects, the latest this year was a personal project named Youth opportunity recognition aimed at increasing youth's knowledge on how to recognize opportunities and use the resources around to act on the opportunities.</p>
<p>Working with youth from different part of the world have made me love and want to work with youth more and more. Coming with different youth project ideas aiming at making a positive impact to the community has been something so exciting to do in my life . As a result I have been thinking of different ways on how I can play part in acting on different challenges facing youth in my community. As a result I came with an idea of having a place where youth facing different challenges can come learn, practice and improve their knowledge through baking as a main activity, Making ""<strong>Luseko bakery for youth</strong> "" a place where youth will feel welcomed and take their life step from there.</p>
<p>This campaign aim at finding the Capital which is the biggest challenge for establishing this center . All funds from this campaign will be used for constructing the place, buying equipment and first three months operating expenses overcoming the risk of survival from luck of operating expenses. In Tanzania we have a say saying '' Youth is today's generation and the kids they do bring is Tomorrow's generation'' Let us help today's and tomorrow's generation then.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Imagine being able to change the lives of many. Imagine being able to help people not only chase dreams, but reach out from the depths of poverty and become successful and thriving human beings.  English at Will has that potential. Through our website and upcoming app, there is a difference that can be made in the lives of many. </p>
<p>Helping impoverished people excel has been my wish and goal with teaching English since I got my first taste while teaching abroad. I’ve traveled to favelas in Brazil and slums in Mexico. I have seen poor in Guatemala and Korea and it has broken my heart. I have dedicated my career to assisting those wanting a better life by teaching the skill of English. </p>
<p>My love of teaching English began as a teacher in South Korea in 2011. That experience drove me to return home with the goal of getting my masters degree in Teaching English as a Second Language. With my bachelors degree being in public relations and business, this was a little bit of a switch up, but it was a move that I just knew was right. </p>
<p>I have loved teaching every step of the journey and I have realized how much English can change the life of a person who has learned it. I have also realized how amazing the people are who take their time to learn the language I was blessed enough to be born into. </p>
<p>I have spent the past 5 years as a college instructor teaching English to students from other countries. These past 5 years have been amazing. I have made so many friends. Even though I’m supposed to be their “teacher” and not their friend, I cannot separate teaching them from loving them, so, many of these students have really become my friends. </p>
<p>I’ve been given so many opportunities in these 5 years. Instead of just teaching English, I’ve been able to teach leadership, also. I’ve also been able to coordinate and develop programs that have given me insights into how the programs are run. </p>
<p>I thought that helping immigrants at the university level was going to be my career for the foreseeable future, but sometimes life can throw some unexpected curveballs. When things seem to be rolling along, speed-bumps often decide to slow you down, but sometimes, the path you have been traveling on becomes completely blocked and you have to take a detour. </p>
<p>That’s why it saddens me that I will have to come out of the classroom as I deal with a medical issue that is robbing me of my ability to teach in the classroom. I have been diagnosed with a cyst in my spinal cord that causes numbness in my hands and pain in my neck and shoulders. This causes the actions of teaching to be almost impossible to do day in and day out. I was told by a neurologist to consider going on disability, but that is not what I am about. I would rather chase my dreams and help others chase theirs. So, with the inability to be affective in a full time position, I’ll have to make a transition into entrepreneurship. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The problem for us is that our plan for starting this business is now being rushed due to the fact that I have developed syringomyelia, a cyst in my spinal cord. With the cyst, I can’t teach the rigorous classes that are required for English courses at the University level, because it requires a lot of movement, up and down, and looking around in the classroom. This is going to cause me to have to cut out my time in the classroom. I will not be able to continue building towards this dream the way that I had planned. </p>
<p><u>That is the reason for this fundraiser. </u></p>
<p>I am asking for you to invest in me with the end goal of me helping many people from around the world reach their dreams. With my inability to continue my career, we have to jumpstart this new chapter in our life. </p>
<p>The process will continue with the app and website getting finished as I recruit 2 teachers to create content. As the app is getting developed we will be creating the marketing materials and designing ads to help teachers and students know about the free tools available on all the platforms. We will be building up the social media accounts while the app is getting finished. The recruited teachers will be trained and I will help them create videos and lessons that will be branded for the teachers to build their brand as the app and website are fully developed. </p>
<p>I have insurance from my job for the next 4 months, so I will continue to get treatment as much as I can while this is active, but the business will be my focus outside of my medical treatments. I will also need to insure that we have the means to live on and I get my medical treatments as I build out this business. </p>
<p>My other plan action will be starting my own tutoring classes at a local church. Though I cannot work at a university any longer, I feel I can still help people here in Florida become better English speakers and communicators with a less rigorous schedule.</p>
<p>The money earned from that can help with the development and deployment of the app and marketing plan. It will also go into equipment for making videos for students. The new iPhone has a great camera and awesome capabilities and I can do that on ATT payments. I will get a good microphone to capture audio for podcasts and videos. So while I build revenue to put into the business, I’ll also be able to give a high value product to immigrants in Boca Raton. I will able to give these dream chasers a valuable service for a fraction of what other entities are charging. </p>
<p>Your donations will help me fully develop the English at Will app and website. It will help us develop free materials to assist English teachers have access to quality lessons and videos. Most importantly, it will allow us to begin the process of helping people from all around the world with a FREE option for learning English. </p>
<p>When English at Will gets enough paying subscribers for the premium teacher access options, we will be set on our path of developing free schools for the underprivileged children who could most benefit from learning English. </p>
<p>Your donations will be a HUGE step towards helping many people emerge from a hole that they could have never dreamed was escapable. </p>
<p>So, please, give what you can. Every dollar matters in this mission to build English at Will into a ray of hope for those around the world who would benefit from English and for me, who is looking for a way to continue pursuing my goal of helping others reach their dreams. </p>
<p>If we make our goal, we can begin the process of helping those in need right away. This will be able to be a full time job for my wife and I as we work to change the world.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We have designed this business to be beneficial to English learners around the world who wish to learn for free. We will also have a subscription option for those who wish to have more access to a teacher. We are also designing it to be beneficial to teachers currently in classrooms by creating lessons for them to use for free and to help their students become better communicators.</p>
<p>Our model is also designed to disrupt the system with how teachers are paid. There will be a great benefit for the teachers who will work with English at Will. </p>
<p><u><strong>Our model is built around helping as many people as we can. Our mission is to help as many people chase their dreams as possible. </strong></u></p>
<p>Our end goal is for English at Will to have enough paid students and successful teachers that we will be able to open free English schools around the world. </p>
<p>Our end goal is to be able to provide the tool of English to those who would otherwise not be able to obtain the skill. Knowing English can change the life of an individual in a country not as blessed as the USA, and I know that from being in the classroom over the years and from my time traveling abroad, is why I am passionate about providing low-cost and free options for the less fortunate to learn English. </p>
<p>The other aspect of our model is to put the power in the hands of the teachers. We are planning on letting the teachers who create the content and provide the lessons keep the majority of the money earned. Instead of small percentages of the tuitions paid by students, we hope to help teachers essentially work for themselves with high earning potential. Teachers, who are the most important person after the student, often get the scraps of what the students pay. English at Will aims at changing that. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our biggest risk is having our model copied and not being first, but we are actually ok with that. If it leads to our goal of many people becoming better speakers of English and reaching their goals, we will be at peace with our model being duplicated. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please, share this campaign with as many people as you are comfortable sharing it with. Please tell businesses about the services we are offering and how we could help them. Convince a company to be a sponsor and to have their logo and link on our page for people around the world to see that the business cares about them. </p>

Imagine being able to change the lives of many. Imagine being able to help people not only chase dreams, but reach out from the depths of poverty and become successful and thriving human beings.  English at Will has that potential.

The process will continue with the app and website getting finished as I recruit 2 teachers to create content. As the app is getting developed we will be creating the marketing materials and designing ads to help teachers and students know about the free tools available on all the platforms. We will be building up the social media accounts while the app is getting finished. The recruited teachers will be trained and I will help them create videos and lessons that will be branded for the teachers to build their brand as the app and website are fully developed. 
I have insurance from my job for the next 4 months, so I will continue to get treatment as much as I can while this is active, but the business will be my focus outside of my medical treatments. I will also need to insure that we have the means to live on and I get my medical treatments as I build out this business. 
My other plan action will be starting my own tutoring classes at a local church. Though I cannot work at a university any longer, I feel I can still help people here in Florida become better English speakers and communicators with a less rigorous schedule.
The money earned from that can help with the development and deployment of the app and marketing plan. It will also go into equipment for making videos for students. The new iPhone has a great camera and awesome capabilities and I can do that on ATT payments. I will get a good microphone to capture audio for podcasts and videos. So while I build revenue to put into the business, I’ll also be able to give a high value product to immigrants in Boca Raton. I will able to give these dream chasers a valuable service for a fraction of what other entities are charging. 
Your donations will help me fully develop the English at Will app and website. It will help us develop free materials to assist English teachers have access to quality lessons and videos. Most importantly, it will allow us to begin the process of helping people from all around the world with a FREE option for learning English. 
When English at Will gets enough paying subscribers for the premium teacher access options, we will be set on our path of developing free schools for the underprivileged children who could most benefit from learning English. 
Your donations will be a HUGE step towards helping many people emerge from a hole that they could have never dreamed was escapable. 
So, please, give what you can. Every dollar matters in this mission to build English at Will into a ray of hope for those around the world who would benefit from English and for me, who is looking for a way to continue pursuing my goal of helping others reach their dreams. 
If we make our goal, we can begin the process of helping those in need right away. This will be able to be a full time job for my wife and I as we work to change the world.

The Impact
We have designed this business to be beneficial to English learners around the world who wish to learn for free. We will also have a subscription option for those who wish to have more access to a teacher. We are also designing it to be beneficial to teachers currently in classrooms by creating lessons for them to use for free and to help their students become better communicators.
Our model is also designed to disrupt the system with how teachers are paid. There will be a great benefit for the teachers who will work with English at Will. 
Our model is built around helping as many people as we can. Our mission is to help as many people chase their dreams as possible. 
Our end goal is for English at Will to have enough paid students and successful teachers that we will be able to open free English schools around the world. 
Our end goal is to be able to provide the tool of English to those who would otherwise not be able to obtain the skill. Knowing English can change the life of an individual in a country not as blessed as the USA, and I know that from being in the classroom over the years and from my time traveling abroad, is why I am passionate about providing low-cost and free options for the less fortunate to learn English. 
The other aspect of our model is to put the power in the hands of the teachers. We are planning on letting the teachers who create the content and provide the lessons keep the majority of the money earned. Instead of small percentages of the tuitions paid by students, we hope to help teachers essentially work for themselves with high earning potential. Teachers, who are the most important person after the student, often get the scraps of what the students pay. English at Will aims at changing that. 

Risks & Challenges
Our biggest risk is having our model copied and not being first, but we are actually ok with that. If it leads to our goal of many people becoming better speakers of English and reaching their goals, we will be at peace with our model being duplicated.

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>We are a group of high school and college students from around the nation and world from the East Coast to Texas to Virginia all the way to Switzerland. Our diverse team offers a unique perspective in the classroom and how it is run from all of our experiences. Together we have created Lecturely a learning management platform. Lecturely was thought of at the 2019 Stanford’s Silicon Valley Innovation Academy. This platform utilizes students' interests that are taken at the account creation level to then replace objects in a Madlib style curriculum creation process that the teacher uses to engage their students. Using automatic reporting based on metrics such as correct/incorrect answers, time spent on questions, and work that needs to be done/is done a teacher, student, and parent can all be in the know of their student's education. </p>
<h2>Team</h2>
<p>As a team of high school and college students, we see this problem first-hand at our schools. Although we're all high school students we are qualified to build this platform. Our COO, Jason, does software development, attribution models, and was responsible for bringing RedHat Academy to his high school through their ambassador program, a first for high school education. Our Head of Marketing, Caterina, got accepted to Stanford University's class of 2024. Our CSO, Josey is a senior at Chapman University majoring in Political Science and minoring in a combination of Economics Philosophy and English. Our CTO, Taylor, has got awards in competitions for his app development and has led many hackathon development teams. And our CEO, Caleb, cofounded FloatMe, a financial wellness app for employees (<a href=""https://floatme.io"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://floatme.io</a>).</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Ever since the industrial revolution, classrooms haven't seen much change. The ability of technology has increased exponentially every year and continues to do so but schools are being left behind. Schools today have the technology to bring education into the 21st century but companies aren't developing software that puts education where it needs to be in the modern era with a rise in specialized jobs and a decrease in industrial jobs. Our team noticed this problem and decided to do something about it. We came up with Lecturely, Lecturely is a classroom management platform that tracks students' interests and bases curriculum on those interests so it's no longer just math, it's math with Minecraft or science with rockets. Our Adaptive Curriculum will keep students more engaged and encourage them to pursue their interests rather it be tomorrow's doctors or astronauts, in today's world interests, are critical to inspiring the future generation that will one-day cure cancer and the first to step on Mars.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our biggest challenge at the moment is not having the funds available to support our Amazon Web Services servers to supply our users. Each user we add to our service is another risk we are taking on.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Not only can you contribute financially to support Lecturely, but if you are a developer, researcher, student, or teacher we would love to hear feedback on our learning management platform.</p>

<h3>Our Stop, Breathe &amp; Think Curriculum</h3>
<p>Tools for Peace developed Stop, Breathe &amp; Think, a step-by-step mindfulness, meditation, and compassion-in-action curriculum that guides participants through a variety of mindfulness activities, personal reflection, and group discussion.

<p><strong>Becoming Aware</strong></p>
<p>Participants deepen their awareness of their thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations.</p>
<p><strong>Broadening Perspective</strong></p>
<p>Participants learn to settle themselves down and proactively manage their actions and reactions.</p>
<p><strong>Compassion-in-Action</strong></p>
<p>Participants engage in service-learning projects that address a community need in their classrooms, on campus, or within the wider community.<br/> </p>

<h3><strong>Short Summary</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Having worked in alternative communities and schools for over 2 decades both in India (Auroville, South India) and the UK, I've had the privilege of meeting some incredible people, explored brilliant ideas and seen first-hand, practical strategies that both support, empower and awaken our children's creative potential in a balanced, age-appropriate way that takes care of their emotional wellbeing too. </li>
<li>I wish this for all children, everywhere. </li>
<li>I believe that until we can help every child thrive, no child can truly flourish. </li>
<li>Festival of the Child will be shared by live broadcast over 7 days in November 2019 and will be completely free to watch live, for all registered participants. The replays will also be available for free for 48 hours following the original broadcast. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564953906/ink6orgfqtc4dhiv6xfo.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Why Is This Important For You &amp; Your Family?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>As parents and educators and people who care about the future, I know that you want to contribute to a world in which your children feel happy, healthy and balanced and a world in which they can truly thrive.</li>
<li>Even if you don't have children yourselves, as stewards of life on this planet, I know that you care about the next generation's wellbeing.</li>
<li>Parents have told us that they want to balance their child's wellbeing alongside their love of learning so that they are better equipped to deal with this age of information overload that we find ourselves in.</li>
<li>Our children and teenagers face unprecedented scrutiny than when we were young, as every bit of their lives is documented and posted online.</li>
<li>Do you ever worry about whether your children are losing the ability to connect authentically to themselves and each other as more and more of their world is online?</li>
<li>Festival of the Child is about providing tools and inspiration for you as parents, educators, and guardians of the next generation's future. </li>
<li>Just like me, I know you want to be a good ancestor to your children. </li>
<li>Over the last 2 decades, I've met some incredible teachers, experts, authors, and storytellers and life-long learners and I strongly feel that what they have to share is for everybody, not just for those with access to alternative forms of education, often only available in private school settings.</li>
<li>Contributing to this project means that more families and children can benefit from access to these ideas and resources. </li>
<li>Whether or not you are a parent or a teacher, or just somebody who cares about humanity, if you feel passionately that the next generation deserve a chance to truly thrive, your support will make that critical difference and enable us to reach more families and children. </li>
<li>Every single contribution makes a TREMENDOUS difference!</li>
<li>Even just £10 means we can directly reach more families.</li>
</ul>

</div></div>","Short Summary

Having worked in alternative communities and schools for over 2 decades both in India (Auroville, South India) and the UK, I've had the privilege of meeting some incredible people, explored brilliant ideas and seen first-hand, practical strategies that both support, empower and awaken our children's creative potential in a balanced, age-appropriate way that takes care of their emotional wellbeing too. 
I wish this for all children, everywhere. 
I believe that until we can help every child thrive, no child can truly flourish. 
Festival of the Child will be shared by live broadcast over 7 days in November 2019 and will be completely free to watch live, for all registered participants. The replays will also be available for free for 48 hours following the original broadcast. 

 

 
Why Is This Important For You & Your Family?

As parents and educators and people who care about the future, I know that you want to contribute to a world in which your children feel happy, healthy and balanced and a world in which they can truly thrive.
Even if you don't have children yourselves, as stewards of life on this planet, I know that you care about the next generation's wellbeing.
Parents have told us that they want to balance their child's wellbeing alongside their love of learning so that they are better equipped to deal with this age of information overload that we find ourselves in.
Our children and teenagers face unprecedented scrutiny than when we were young, as every bit of their lives is documented and posted online.
Do you ever worry about whether your children are losing the ability to connect authentically to themselves and each other as more and more of their world is online?
Festival of the Child is about providing tools and inspiration for you as parents, educators, and guardians of the next generation's future. 
Just like me, I know you want to be a good ancestor to your children. 
Over the last 2 decades, I've met some incredible teachers, experts, authors, and storytellers and life-long learners and I strongly feel that what they have to share is for everybody, not just for those with access to alternative forms of education, often only available in private school settings.
Contributing to this project means that more families and children can benefit from access to these ideas and resources. 
Whether or not you are a parent or a teacher, or just somebody who cares about humanity, if you feel passionately that the next generation deserve a chance to truly thrive, your support will make that critical difference and enable us to reach more families and children. 
Every single contribution makes a TREMENDOUS difference!
Even just £10 means we can directly reach more families.

This is a passion project and a complete labour of love. We've already spent 4.5 months sourcing speakers, creating and curating content, recording interviews, creating graphics for the website, working on a campaign for social media etc. and so much more!
It's been an amazing, enriching experience connecting with some truly wonderful and extraordinary human beings. Human beings just like you with their own personal wisdom and fresh perspectives to share.

Website, Development & Hosting £1,375

We are reimagining education and bringing a revolution to learning. With our children subject to increased and insane levels of testing in schools and our teenagers suffering from higher levels of mental anxiety, stress and depression than ever before, it's vital that we REIMAGINE EDUCATION now. 
Now is the time for each one of us to courageously come together and see what future we can co-create.

The Impact:

I've spent the last 2 decades working alongside schools in both India & the UK and have spoken with literally hundreds of parents sharing their concerns about their children and their deepest wishes and dreams for them too.
We are building a community from the grassroots up - we've listened to your concerns and worries about what the future holds for your children and this is a direct response to that. 
Your contribution directly means we can reach even more parents. We'd love to reach 100k people. 
You will be supporting not just the project, but the wellbeing of children everywhere. Until we can support every child to thrive, no child can truly flourish.
I dream of a world where we think of each other's children as we think of our own. A world where taking collective responsibility for how we raise and educate the next generation is the best way to ensure we have a sustainable future on planet earth.
Over the last 2 decades, I've successfully supported schools and organisations to communicate their message more clearly and reach the people who are longing to hear from them!  I've been involved with community building through a wide variety of activities, including sharing in-house print and digital magazines, organising fundraising events and fairs and generally helping to spread the word about ideas that work through parent talks, informative articles in national publications and much much more. 
Since 2013, I've created and managed 2 Facebook pages with a shared fan base of 20k people (including Imagine A School Where) that are reaching audiences of 60-270k people each week).
It's clear from these pages that parents and educators just like you are hungry for ideas and strategies that work and can support your parenting journey.
Engagement is high and we are at a critical threshold to raise awareness about tools and practices that help children thrive. Too many children are suffering and it doesn't need to be that way. 
Your support allows us to reach a tremendous amount of parents and families just like you, all longing to create a future where their children are happy and can truly thrive.
When speaking to over 100 parents, they all have shared the same thing, ""I just want my children to be happy."" We're pretty confident that's you too!
Your contribution helps us empower more families and help ALL our children to thrive.

<p><strong>Why Real Spanish?</strong></p>
<p>We’ve tested some prototype materials  with a focus group. The results of the survey were extremely encouraging. For example:</p>
<p>“High quality of all aspects of layout and presentation.”</p>
<p>“Very good pedagogical approach. Real movies, news, speech. Full transcripts and translation. Tests are thorough.”</p>
<p>“The introductory explanation was comprehensive and the main video and ancillary learning materials provided interest, both from cultural and linguistic aspect. The material encourages further learning.”</p>
<p>“I was impressed overall, with how engaging and well presented the learning materials are.”</p>
<p>“The PDFs are very helpful, it is good to have the transcript and the grammar for reference. The cultural and social content is interesting. The exercises work well.”</p>
<p>“Great concept, picked up a lot of expressions just in the introduction!”</p>
<p>“I like the concept of using real-life Spanish video material in the teaching of Spanish to foreigners very much indeed! And I liked the introductions and the whole set up of the lecciones. I found the grammar and the transcriptions very useful too, and the self-test apparatus as well. I like the accent on colloquial (as opposed to literary or formal) language - that strikes me as very useful indeed.""</p>

<p><strong>She Did It Anyway is a compilation of stories, illustrated with comics, about 17 Italian women who were told their dreams were ‘impossible’ or ‘absurd’ and did the unimaginable anyway.</strong></p>

<p>The idea for this book came from the many discussions we had at CLF with middle school kids who attended CLF's leadership development program: <i>Let's Make a Difference</i>. During the program participants are asked to name, outside of sports or entertainment, 10 famous Italian women. 95% of participants couldn't name more than one or two Italian women. When asked why it was hard to name women, some common answers included: 'women wanted to stay home', 'women weren't allowed to do a lot of things' or 'women weren't interested in achievement'.</p>
<p><i>L'idea di questo libro è nata dai numerosi incontri fatti con i ragazzi delle scuole medie che hanno partecipato al programma di sviluppo della leadership della CLF: 'Facciamo la differenza'. Durante il programma ai partecipanti veniva chiesto di nominare 10 donne italiane famose, escludendo i settori dello sport o dello spettacolo.  Il 95% dei partecipanti non poteva nominarne più di una o due. Alla domanda sul perché fosse difficile nominare donne italiane capaci di distinguersi, alcune risposte piú comuni erano: ""le donne volevano restare a casa"", ""alle donne non era permesso fare molte cose"" o ""le donne non erano interessate ai risultati"".</i></p>

In the case of Cerebral Palsy, in the U.S. alone, 764,000 people have at least 1 symptom of Cerebral Palsy, and around 10,000 babies are born each year with Cerebral palsy.When it comes to motor, physical and intellectual disabilities in general, the percentage of people with disabilities in the US population rose from 11.9% in 2010 to 12.6% in 2013, and it kept rising ever since. Globally, according to the WHO, about 15% of the world's population lives with some form of disability. However, despite the fact that there are literally hundreds of millions of people with physical, motor and intellectual disabilities all over the world, the truth is that, up until now, these people didn't have any specialized tool that allowed them to autonomously and efficiently use a computer or even a smartphone.That's why we're so happy to introduce you to the Key-X Multifunctional Keyboard, a special keypad with just eleven touch-sensitive keys, which can be even activated by the blink of an eye, in case its user has a severe physical disability.The Key-X was designed by Key2Enable to be the perfect special education resource for students with Cerebral Palsy and many other disabilities and the perfect keypad for adults with Cerebral Palsy or any motor impairment. With the Key-X, a person with any disability can efficiently and autonomously write, work, study and play with a computer, tablet or smartphone without any barriers.Can you imagine how many thoughts become unexpressed, experiences unenjoyed, and talents unexplored just due to the fact that millions of people with Cerebral Palsy can't make a free and autonomous use of essential devices such as computers? Well, we can, which is why Key2Enable decided to develop a keyboard that is literally a key to open the doors of digital inclusion to people with Cerebral Palsy while also designing it to be just as useful to people with Down Syndrome, Autism, Tremors, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and many other physical, motor and intellectual disabilities.Developed in Brazil, Key-X has been already tested by over 2,000 people with different disabilities who have enjoyed the easy typing experience that the keyboard offers with its iconographic keys that are activated in double sequences.They have found that, with Key-X, they can even type any alphanumeric or accentuation character, along with punctuation, symbols, and any other command that is available in a conventional keyboard. This multifunctional keyboard also allows users to have precise control of the cursor on the screen, working like any common mouse, allowing people with Cerebral Palsy and other motor disabilities to work, write, study, research and even play.Also, keeping in mind the special needs of Key-X’s users, the keypad for people with Cerebral Palsy and other motor impairments is built with large, well-spaced and touch-sensitive keys that allow the use of the panel without needing much force. However, the keyboard is robust enough to resist rough touches, and it can even be used with the feet, to further open more possibilities of usage to everyone who needs such a keyboard.The Key-X does not require any specific software in order to be used for internet browsing, social networks, text editors and even games, and its plug-and-play USB interface requires no configuration. Indeed, this device has been developed to offer unparalleled autonomy and control over computers, smartphones, and tablets to disabled people who have thus far struggled to make an autonomous and functional use of these devices.The Key-X also comes with accessories and aid applications that make it even more versatile and efficient as a tool for the digital inclusion of people with Cerebral Palsy and other disabled people:In the present campaign, we are offering the X-Trig as a complimentary extra reward for the backers who buy the Key-X or donate it to one of the pre-selected organizations that this campaign wants to support through the donation of Key-X Keyboards.The X-Trig, a robust external click switch, that allows full control of the Key-X for the users whose disabilities keep them from directly using the keyboard, is an accessory that comes with the Key-X as a reward of this campaignEarlier in 2018, the Key-X earned the inestimable support of the Singularity University, who has taken Key2Enable into its portfolio of companies that are leveraging exponential technologies to address the world’s most intractable problems, and our experience in Brazil has been nothing but encouraging. To say that this fills our hearts with pride and motivation is an understatement.Gleisson Fernandes, a computer scientist with Cerebral Palsy, was the original developer of a special 9-key keyboard that allowed him to easily use a computer instead of the helmet pointer that he used before. When Key2Enable founders met Gleisson, an immediate friendship and collaboration began. Key2Enable took it from there, eventually developing the Key-X, an improved 11-key version keyboard that has all the functions of a normal keyboard and mouse.Daniel is learning how to code Java while using the Key-X just by blinking his eyes, using Key-X’s accessory a-Blin-X, which allows people to use the keyboard even if they are severely disabled.Julia, on the other hand, was isolated due to her struggle with the limitations that Cerebral Palsy previously imposed on her, but she now goes to a regular classroom, in which the Key-X has allowed her to be considered the best mathematics student in her class.These are just two examples of success stories but, in Brazil, there are literally hundreds of similar stories of children and adults who overcame the typical barriers to communicate, work, study and play by using the Key-X.By being simply activated through a combination of two keys to delivering one command, and by having only 11 keys that control all the more than 200 functions that a regular keyboard has, Key-X is the perfect tool for the digital inclusion of people with Cerebral Palsy and other disabilities.Through our Indiegogo campaign, we want to:
Allow people with Cerebral Palsy and other disabled people, as well as those who care for them, to know about our assistive technology and how it can improve their quality of life
Promote the use of Key-X in the USA and around the world, creating an empowering culture for its use
Pilot our Assistive Technologies in selected markets and channels across the United States in the next 6 months
Work on our channels with partners with contracts at schools and reaching organizations for people with motor disabilities
Reach a significant part of the 10 million people with motor disabilities in the United States over the course of the next 3 years
You can support the Key-X Multifunctional Keyboard by purchasing one for yourself or for a loved one, or you can purchase one of these very special multifunctional keyboards and donate it to any hospital or organization in the world that you choose — and we will make sure that a Key-X will get there.Alternatively, since every dollar counts, you can make a contribution of any amount and we will pool all these smaller contributions together to purchase Key-X Keyboards and send them to the pre-selected and vetted organizations in our list above. So, when you make a contribution between $1 and $750, please make sure that you let us know to which one of these organizations above you want the Key-X Keyboard that you help to purchase and donate to go.We're in the early stage of an ambitious worldwide mission to offer autonomous and efficient digital inclusion and empowerment to people with Cerebral Palsy and other disabilities all over the globe to develop their skills, unleash their talents, and explore their individualities.

The organization is run by a team of volunteer counsellors, many of whom were campers before joining the staff. Much like other summer camps, we have plenty of fun and engaging activities, a compassionate staff and a beautiful setting up at Camp Kinkora in the Laurentians! </p><p>What sets Youth in Action apart from the rest is the commitment to provide access to the camp to children of all economic backgrounds. One of our fundamental principles is that we never turn down a camper for lack of funds. In order to accommodate this, we have a fund that provides subsidies to any camper that requires financial aid. The demand for subsidies grows every year. In 2013, we subsidized 24 campers to attend, in 2014, the number raised to almost 30. In 2015, we're expecting subsidy requests to be higher than in any year prior. Please help us to keep sending children to camp by donating to this fund right here on our indiegogo campaign page!</p><p></p><p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;""></span></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F-18Ov80FvoA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D-18Ov80FvoA&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F-18Ov80FvoA%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">The Impact</span></p><p>Sending one camper to camp for the week costs $350. </p><p>If we can get 35 people to donate $10, we've got it. </p><p>That ten dollars that you would have spent on a sandwich for lunch, or two coffees this week, or a ticket to a movie, will go towards making sure that one lucky kid will get to have a life-changing experience at Youth in Action Camp next summer. </p><p>And what's better than sending ONE lucky kid to camp???

President of Accelerating Catholic Church Reform, Inc. (ACCR), which publishes
the free, on-line quarterly magazine, OMG!
A Journal of Religion & Culture. 
My campaign team consists
of our Editor/Publisher Mary Anne Winfield; Managing Editor M.D. Ridge;
Webmaster Megan Carson; and the four students from the Communications and Film
Course at LeMoyne College, Ashley Colon, Keara Sammon, Ronnie Bertrand and
Nicole Shutowich who produced our video.
In October 2013 the
leadership of ACCR realized there was a need for a vehicle to clearly communicate
authoritative information on many issues to the Church, hierarchy and laity in
order to advance the notion that to survive the Church must completely change
the way it does business.
We decided the best vehicle
was a high quality, thoughtful, all-inclusive and free, on-line quarterly magazine,
which soon became OMG! A Journal of
Religion & Culture.
I asked my friend, internationally
known journalist and author Robert Blair Kaiser to help us make this concept a
reality as its Editor/Publisher. He quickly accepted, with two conditions I readily embraced:
· 
He would publish OMG! for a year,
to a year and a half, by convincing some of his writer friends to donate
articles previously published elsewhere, at no cost to us.
· 
When he had enough quarterly issues to
demonstrate the quality level he wanted, he would personally approach three or
four of his “wealthy friends” for funding “which would allow us to pay our
writers a living wage, putting us in a rather elite group”.

You can also help support workshops, psilocybin identification outings, book clubs and gatherings.    What We Need  We are asking for  €1250 to aid the first year of events for the Psychedelic Society of Ireland. This money will go towards:


Rent of a suitable venues in cities across Ireland
Travel costs for guest speakers including Irish shamans and experts on the safe use of psychedelics.
Flights and other travel costs for UK based guest speakers including professors specializing in the medicinal used of psilocybin, LSD and MDMA, who are currently undertaking testing in the UK.
PA hire for the events.
Printing for promotion and advertisements.


What You Get
Everyone who supports this campaign with even the smallest donation will get a huge THANK YOU from everyone in the Psychedelic Society. You will be personally thanked on the event programmes. Your support will not only benefit us, but it will benefit a large community of people in Ireland who are hungry for information and experience.



If you donate €20+ you will receive an official Psychedelic Society poster.


If you donate €50+ you will become an official member of the Psychedelic Society and will gain priority tickets for every event we hold (keeping in mind many events will be intimate with a limited amount of tickets available) This will ensure you can attend every event you so kindly helped support. 


If you cannot financially support us, you can help us in other ways. Please make some noise about this campaign! Post it on your social medias, tell your friends and family, and please keep in contact with us on our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/psysocire


Most importantly, be open about your interest in psychedelics. We aim to break the taboo in Ireland, and you can help us do this.
    We have the contacts, we have the professionals, we have the market, all we need is your financial support to bring the Psychedelic Society to Ireland.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</h3> <p>The highest rate of female AND male murders in Canada, at a heinous, serial level, are among its Aboriginal People. </p>
<p>Most publicized is <b><a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/martin-lukacs/aboriginal-women_b_994185.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Missing &amp; Murdered Native Women</a></b>. Over 1,200 Women are missing from known, plus many deemed unknown, causes. (Please note scripts in blue indicates LINKs for more information.)</p>
<p>Known causes include those who have lost their lives at the hands of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Pickton"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Robert Picton</b></a>, a serial killer in Port Coquitlam, B.C., many missing on the<b> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_of_Tears_murders"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Highway of Tears</a></b>, a 500 mile section of Hwy 16 between Prince George and Prince Rupert, B.C., to the many naive Youth who so sadly fall prey to evil men when they leave the sanctuary of their homes to either visit or move to large cities.</p>
<p>Despite continued pleas from its Aboriginal People, the Government of Canada has steadfastly refused to call a <b><a href=""http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/national-inquiry-into-missing-and-murdered-aboriginal-women/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">National Inquiry</a></b> into this horrific situation. </p>
<p>Regardless of when the Canadian Government finally decides to call a full National Inquiry, one Canadian has stepped in to help with an information programme to help educate Canada's vulnerable youth, of all races, colours and creeds, hoping that through this initiative, they will be better trained to choose and make the right decisions when faced with potential dangerous situations.</p>
<p>Niagara, Ontario portrait artist, <b><a href=""http://www.cbc.ca/player/News/Canada/Toronto/ID/2431650081/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Michael Rilstone</a></b>, has painted <b><a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/news/tina-fontaine/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tina Fontaine</a></b>, one of the vulnerable Native youth who visited a large city and was killed. She was found murdered, wrapped in plastic, and tossed into Winnipeg, Manitoba's Red River on August 17, 2014. She was only 15 years old!</p>
<p>Winnipeg's Police Sgt. John O’Donovan stated on television, ""This is a child that's been murdered. I think society would be horrified if someone put a litter of kittens or pups in the river in this condition. This is a child. She has been in this city for barely a month, exploited, murdered and put in the river in this condition.""<br/></p>
<p>Rilstone, himself a parent, felt like he had been kicked in the stomach when watching Tina's body being pulled from the river and decided to do something to help stop this carnage. He states, ""We are all of the human race, in this together. We must all keep talking, educating, and providing information to stop the travesty.""</p>
<p>Crafting an educational plan for schools Canada-wide, he will furnish schools with two teaching aids. </p>
<p>First, Rilstone spent several months on Tina's portrait. Legally blind, he paints one drop at a time, acrylic on canvas, using a toothpick for a brush. He paints looking through a powerful magnifying light, necessary to see where he is applying each drop. Tina's portrait is approximately 25,000 individual drops of paint.</p>
<p>Rilstone says, ""I do not understand the Creator, God and spirituality, but I did feel Tina was guiding my hand while painting and helping to formulate this project to educate her peers into the evils that lurk to hurt our Youth.""</p>
<p>He creates his portraits in a unique, monochromatic style, generally using shades of grays, plus black and white. When he thought he had finished, Rilstone felt Tina's hand once more and added some blue, which gave high contrast and impact to his finished portrait: a blue teary eye and two blue tear drops on her cheek.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The final portrait is called <b>Trillions of Tears</b> and to Rilstone it represents not only the tears for Canada's Missing &amp; Murdered Native Women and Men, but also the colonialism and genocide that Aboriginal People have suffered on Turtle Island since 1492.</span><br/></p>
<p>Rilstone plans to supply artist-signed, fine art prints of <b>Trillions of Tears </b>to as many schools in Canada as possible. It will be a constant reminder to our Youth of the evils that lurk in waiting, ready to exploit, hurt and often murder them.</p>

Rilstone plans to supply artist-signed, fine art prints of Trillions of Tears to as many schools in Canada as possible. It will be a constant reminder to our Youth of the evils that lurk in waiting, ready to exploit, hurt and often murder them.
The educational information campaign will also include The Tina Fontaine Story which will recount what a beautiful girl Tina was and her sad demise in Winnipeg. 
The Tina Fontaine Story will be co-written by Tina's Family and Rilstone, in consultation with experts specializing in teaching, plus a member of Canada's penal system. The highest percentage of inmates in Canadian prisons are Aboriginal. Hopefully, The Tina Initiative can also assist our Native Youth to make better decisions before they break the law.  
This IndieGoGo fundraising drive will assist Rilstone with the launch of The Tina Initiative. 
Once operational, Rilstone will be donating a major portion of all proceeds made on the sale of Tina's portrait Trillions of Tears to help keep supplying schools Nationwide with this educational campaign.

This powerful message came from one KNOWS: one who works with troubled Native Women in Canada's prison system. Commenting on The Tina Initiative, she wrote, ""Bravo! I do programming at our institution to raise awareness on the missing and murdered with the women for themselves and to pass on to their children as well. Sadly, our Native Sisters are over represented in jail to the tune of about 30% here in the south and up to 100% in the north versus 2% of the general population. I would be pleased to assist in any way I can and would love to post Tina's picture in our institution and give the women an opportunity to read her story. Success depends on your perspective. If one woman's life is saved through your work I call it an unparalleled and valuable success. I suspect however, that your initiative may serve to generate more collective action and save many.""

    Other Ways You Can Help Thank you for taking your valuable time to learn about, and hopefully support, The Tina Initiative. If you have reached this point, you must be a caring person, wanting our world to be a far better place for all.
We hope to inscribe your name as a Friend of The Tina Initiative on every Trillions of Tears print.
And please share our programme with as many friends as possible! 
We CAN save lives and we WILL!
Above all, keep talking about Missing & Murdered Women and Men in Canada. Nothing gets accomplished when the talking stops. Or as Martin Luther King Jr. said, ""Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.""

</div></div>","Many young women living in urban slums are without their right to choose their own destinies. Often they are unable to join the workforce as they are forced to stay home with their young (pre school age) children or end up employed as domestic workers. Despite their important role, women are among the most exploited in the world.



By improving access to affordable and quality early childhood care and education, we can ensure young mothers have a safe and convenient place to keep their children during the working day while empowering other young women to join the workforce in more meaningful and dignified ways. 








The Social Impacts

The term yogya translates from Sanskrit to ‘worthy.’
Yogya is an innovative early childhood solution that empowers young women from urban slums to become next generation leaders in delivering early childhood care and education.


Yogya's aim is to provide employment, education and entrepreneurship opportunities for young women from urban slums, between the ages of 18-25, with the goal of inspiring future mothers, educators and social entrepreneurs.
We are designed to make the path to leadership easier for young women by offering an integrated training program and safe space for women to deliver early childhood care and education to children from urban slums, between the ages of 1-4, that focuses on the underlying characteristics of trust, autonomy and initiative. 
Our Integrated Training Program 




SMS Interactive Training - basic training is offered at a freemium leveraging SMS technology and coupled with distributed visual guidebooks  

Observation Training - intermediate training is offered through a peer to peer training model 

In-Field Training - advanced training and basic compensation is offered through an experiential training model 

Levelled Training - ongoing training through SMS technology is required monthly to maintain full compensation over a two year training period









Our Goal This Year: Minimum Viable Product 







Our Goal 5 Years: Product Scale 








The Impact of $25,000

Our Implementation Plan -July/August 2015

    








Who We Are 

We are a team of aspiring social entrepreneurs from the Masters of Design in Strategic Foresight and Innovation program at OCAD University in Toronto. 
This past March, we competed in the Regional Finals of the Hult Prize Challenge in San Francisco, one of the largest student competition and start up platforms for social good - and we're fortunate to have made top 6. This experience only fuelled our passion for moving forward... 
We're now fighting for a chance to make the wildcard round of the 2015 Hult Prize Global Finals for a chance to secure USD1 million in seed capital to launch our sustainable social venture. 

               

Other Ways You Can Help As students ourselves, we understand that some of you might find it difficult to contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help! There's always a way to show your support:

<p>The Yellow Movement Valentine's Day fundraiser first took place in 2013 with 500 flowers donation and the movement was able to raise 4000 ($200) Ethiopian Birr by selling the flowers at Addis Ababa University Main Campus. The following year, we added one more location and took our fundraiser to the streets of 4kilo. That year, we were able to raise 42,000 ($2,000) Ethiopian Birr. In February of 2015, we expanded even more; by delivering large bouquets to businesses and persons who made larger donations. That year we were able to raise 107,000 ($5,000) Ethiopian Birr and were able to launch 'The Yellow Movement Scholarship Fund'. Finally, in 2016, with support the Global Shapers Addis and U.S. Embassy, we expanded to over six location and with dozens more deliveries we we’re able to raise 168,000 Birr ($8,000).</p>
<p>The scholarship fund is different from the simple fundraiser we have been doing in the fact that it pre-selects students and provides a continuous support throughout the year.

We plan to establish a shop where profits directly go to the scholarship fund. We also plan to link it with a mentorship program so that students are able to get more than financial support.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary We are a brand new NGO aimed at increasing awareness around issues of technology addiction and promoting the responsible use of technology.
We love technology and appreciate all the amazing advantages that it brings us, but we also recognise some of the ways it can be harmful. So many of us are addicted to our phones, tablets, computers and gaming consoles that we believe, as a society, our relationship to technology has become unhealthy. 
And we want to do something about it.
Some of the issues we're working on include:

Developing programmes for those affected by cyberbullying

Helping build awareness and legislation around texting and driving and other issues of road safety linked to technology Creating a network of support for those with gaming addictions


Building awareness around our every day use of technology, how it affects us and our relationships, and how we can make it healthier 
Developing school programmes to teach kids and teens about how to use technology in a healthy way

Corporate consulting programmes for businesses to help increase job satisfaction, productivity and maintain healthy work-life balance  
Why We Need Your Help 
Here's the deal: we are currently a (very new) non-profit organisation. In the UK, a non-profit needs to have £5,000 in donations before it can register as a charity. Once we make the leap from non-profit organisation to an official bonafide charity, we are eligible to apply for lots of grants and funding that as a non-profit we can't apply for. 
All the funds we raise will simultaneously help us become a charity and will also help us develop awareness projects and educational programmes. So it's almost like you're making a donation towards two great causes. 
We can't express enough the magnitude of what reaching this goal would entail, how much it would help develop these programmes in the early stages, and how grateful we would be for the support.    The Impact Still not sure? Here are some of the reasons we think this is important:   Addiction. 60% of teens and 37% of adults admit they are 'highly addicted' to their phones. 
69% of kids have been affected by cyberbullying. (Bullying, in any form, can lead to greater instances of isolation, depression, decreased self-esteem, self-harm and suicide.)
Texting and driving makes us 23 times more likely to crash. (Hands-free devices aren't much better.)

Internet Gaming Disorder is being considered for inclusion in the DSM, which means gaming addiction may soon be classified as a mental disorder.

Prevalence. One study showed that 16-24 years olds consumed over 14 hours and 7 minutes of media per day and that adults consumed over 12 hours per day. Most of us reach for technology immediately when we wake up, have it with us throughout the day, and sleep next to it at night (if not literally with us in bed). 



    
We spend our lives surrounded by technology, and while it certainly makes things easier, we rarely pause to think about the drawbacks and the long-term effects of our consumption, which we don't yet fully understand. Until we understand the full implications of our technology use, we believe it is extra important to be aware of how much we use our devices and in what ways, so we can enjoy a healthy and moderated relationship to technology. 
Other Ways You Can Help  Our goal is to see people step back, be present, and appreciate all the amazing things that aren't on a phone or device. The simplest way you can help us is by doing just that: take a break from your phone, tablet and/or computer. (Some ideas: don't sleep next to it/use it as your alarm. Never use it while you're driving. Turn off notifications and only check your devices when you choose to. Turn it off on vacation. Remove social media apps--or other apps that distract you--from your phone. Ignore it while you're with your friends and family.)

SUMMARY - Zero Tolerance in Greece

Hi and
thanks for looking at our initiative. Please watch the video as it will give
you a really good sense of what we are looking to accomplish through Zero
Tolerance.

My name
is Gaz Kishere and I have been working in community development for more than
25 years. The last 6 of these have been working in Counter Child Trafficking
across Europe.Through working with Cross Border Initiatives (www.crossborderinitiatives.org) and the International organisation Love146 (www.love146.org), I have largely been developing out of the box approaches and tools to protect children.
It all
began for me with a 5,000 mile roadtrip following Europes Trafficking routes in the chilly winter of 2009.
It
became clear to me on that trip, in each country visited, that it is the lack of self-esteem and basic awareness, that Trafficking exists, which is making recruitment by Traffickers the largest and most lucrative of all organized crimes in Europe. Through research and first hand experience, i know of communities where 90% of the girls approached will apply to adverts for obviously bogus jobs. There are communities where boys grow up aspiring to become pimps and traffickers as their number 1 job choice.Change is possible, it has to be, children and young people in Europe and beyond are counting on it, are counting on us !

I am a
strong believer that through creativity and innovation we can find new ways to
impact this 'modern day' slavery. 

We need
to do what we can to protect children from joining the 1.2 Million new children
being trafficked each year.ZERO TOLERANCE

Im going to tell you about a youth culture magazine called Zero Tolerance which gives us privileged access to an audience of young
people where we can:


·  Invest in young peoples self-esteem
addressing vulnerabilities that will stop them becoming future victims of exploitation
at home and abroad.

·  Sustain a campaign, breaking the taboos
of silence for those experiencing abuse in institutions and family.

·  Help them become activists who stand against
the exploitation happening in their own country. 

·  Challenge cultural worldviews so that
exploitation becomes unacceptable.
In my
experience prevention is the most strategic response to Human Trafficking, both
in terms of protecting vulnerable young people and confronting demand.

However,
it seems the hardest to fund and it is individuals like you that make a
critical difference to helping to birth fresh ideas.

Through
creating multiple editions of Zero Tolerance and growing an online community
of support, we believe we can take a generation of young people on a sustained journey
of personal development and assure the freedom that all children deserve.

Zero
Tolerance Edition 1 is ready to go to the printer and be distributed now! 

We
wanted to show you what we can actually accomplish, not just share our aspirations.WHAT WE
NEED AND WHAT YOU GET

We are
looking to raise funding for the following:
3 new
editions of the magazine in year 1 @ $18,000                                                      (3 x 5,000 copies of each magazine)
Essential part time personnel to include designer and editor in year 1 @ $12,000

We have
some great incentives to say thank you for your support, these can be found in
the side column.
These include
ZT Trucker Caps individually Graffiti’d by UK artist Trevor Loveys. 

There
are some unique recycled denim ZT DJ bags made by local Abolitionists. 

One of the donations gets you a ZT designed color A4 ‘I WANT TO CHANGE THE WORLD’
poster of the Margaret Meade quote ‘Never
doubt that a small group of committed individuals can change the world, in fact
it is the only thing that ever has’. 

Finally,
you can also get a 20 minute personal or group skype call with Gaz Kishere to chat about his experiences of Human
Trafficking, strategy development and stories about work on the ground in
Europe and beyond.

All
funds given will go directly towards putting these magazines in the hands of
vulnerable young people and future change makers.

<div>There are few challenges which are unique to StaxTeam, they are as follows and we are confident to resolve them:</div>
<div><ul>
<li>
<b>Breaking the stigma of physical work space:</b> Even though in few industries physical presence is not required, managers and team leads prefer to have physical presence of a person. The change requires convincing and the trend in current technologies like BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) etc.. is pointing towards the change. </li>
<li>
<b>Team Work Experience: </b>Maintaining a good team is essential to any organization, we strive to make our collaboration module in the system to be as perfect as providing the physical presence. We believe we can provide a good experience for people who join the company and people who provide the work.</li>
<li>
<b>Technological Challenges:</b> By far the most challenging part is providing the virtual workspace solution which can be tied to the corporate network. Even though this is the final phase of the project, it is very important to StaxTeam, we are working on the solution to this problem and are in touch with experts from the various fields. We are confident that with more experts working on the issue we can resolve it and the campaign will assist us in doing so. </li>
