<h3>Hello!</h3>
<div>We are a young business that brings together students, parents and teachers in a common cause, healthy choices in school!  Our school is very close to a commercial street where fast food restaurants are numerous.  Since our start in 2013, our goal has been to offer interesting options that are nutritious at a great price!  We feel that our cause is just and that students can make the right choice.   Already our biggest seller is fruit!  We feel we are on the right track to being the first choice for a lot of students and we need your help to continue to be available to them.</div>
<h3>Bonjour!  </h3>
<p>Nous sommes une jeunes entreprise qui rassemble étudiants, parents et enseignants dans un même but qui est d'offrir un choix santé à l'école.  Notre école se situe très près d'une rue commerciale où les restaurants abondent.  Depuis notre conception en 2013, nous avons travaillé à offrir aux élèves des repas intéressants qui sont nourrissants et peu dispendieux.  Nous croyons que notre cause est importante et que les élèves sont capables de faire les bons choix.  Déjà, les plus gros vendeurs sont des fruits.  Nous croyons être sur la bonne voie et nous avons besoin de votre aide afin de demeurer disponibles pour eux.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What we need from you is simple, its a chance.</h3>
<div>We all know how difficult it is to start a business at any given time but our clientele is a really small one and they have been going out to lunch for years now.  We need to make them see that the cafeteria is a great place and that we have what they need!  For this we need time and well, time is money.  The money we are asking for is just a little help in the day to day.  We need a little backup for when thing break, and they do!  We are housed in the first building to get electricity in our city, that means, its really old!  We are a non-profit organization that just want to have the time to get established and we see that this will work because our most loyal customers are the younger students.  </div>

<h3>Ce dont nous avons besoin est simple, c'est une chance.</h3>
<div>Nous savons tous combien il est difficile de démarrer une entreprise à n'importe quel moment mais notre clientèle est très petite et elle sort pour aller diner depuis des années.  Nous avons besoin de leur faire voir que la cafétéria est un endroit intéressant et que nous avons ce qu'ils veulent!  Pour cela, nous avons besoin de temps et le temps, c'est de l'argent.  L'argent que nous vous demandons servira un peu au jour le jour.  Nous avons aussi besoin d'un petit coussin pour quand les choses brisent, et elles brisent!  Nous sommes situés dans le premier bâtiment à recevoir l'électricité dans notre ville, ce qui veut dire qu'il est vraiment vieux!  Nous sommes un organisme à but non lucratif qui veut seulement avoir le temps de s'établir et nous savons que cela va fonctionner parce que le plus gros de notre clientèle se compose de jeunes élèves.  </div>

<p>I am Pamela Tilley, a retired, disabled, U.S. Army female
veteran who served 21 years including during the Vietnam campaign. We've
created a product campaign to support our veteran efforts.</p>
<p><b>This BuddyVet is a simple vehicle designed for social
entrepreneurship. </b>BuddyVet initially inspires all persons to support a veteran
from any level they can. The hand-made object itself is charming, catchy, and
it draws others to support veterans.</p>
<p>BuddyVet is an important campaign because it is an
example of how to give support to other non-profit veteran services that we
have established. It provides opportunities to other veterans -- especially
disabled vets -- a place for part-time employment by producing BuddyVets.
Several designs for products are already established, but it takes capital to
generate a factory concept to both employ veterans and serve large retail
organizations with our products. We have interest but cannot supply in large
enough quantities until we establish a larger stock and a factory concept.</p>
<p><i>Contributors can help us achieve large quantities through
mass production and help service other BuddyVet products for the same intent.</i></p>
<p>Our first major hurdle is having the right tooling for mass
production of our hard plastic BuddyVet; that being the digital designs and the molding development, which
are the most costly. Our molding process is $35,000 - $40,000; materials (fabric, thread, sewing machines, and stuffing) and
standardization of our BuddyVet plush requires $8,000 - $10,000; the remaining
$10,000 is for product processing, packaging and shipping, wherein lies the part-time
employment vehicle for our veterans.</p>
<p>This is the essence of our factory concept and the total
estimate for this initial project is approximately $60,000. We can produce
large volume products, supply large retail outlets, and employ veterans all within
one year of this funding. Our challenge is not having funds in a timely enough
fashion to meet upcoming market opportunities, thus losing a year that could
have employed veterans.</p>
<p><i><b>People love our BuddyVet products!</b></i> It reconnects them with
their veteran family members regardless of where they are. It reminds us all of
veterans who have served.</p>
<p>If funded, our project will employ veterans, increase
awareness for veteran support, and most importantly, be a duplicating avenue
for other veterans to re-establish themselves through social entrepreneurship.
<b>Your contributions will make this possible.</b> And by helping to spread the word,
you are creating a lasting way to support veterans.</p>

<div><b>History of the Market</b></div>
<div>In January 2015 a few small-acreage farmer friends started brainstorming the idea of starting up a farmers market in East Whatcom County as there were no fresh produce markets to be had.  An application to the Community Food Coop's Farm Fund kickstarted the project with a $2,000 grant that allowed us to rescue an old abandoned trailer frame from the blackberries and buy supplies to begin transformation into a mobile produce-moving machine.  Our trailer subcommittee spent the next 5 months getting the trailer constructed for opening day.  We purchased metal from the local scrapyard and constructed our mobile enterprise.  </div>
<div>A call was sent out to the local farmer community to see if any other farmers would be interested in participating.  In the end 8 farms signed on for the season, to try out a new model of market.  The Twin Sisters Market is non-traditional.  Farmers collaborate on supplying produce each week, i.e. one farm brings beets, carrots, and kale, while another brings tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers.  We strive to keep thing equitable and fair, making sure each farm has the opportunity to get a fair piece of the pie.  As a full member of the market you are also expected to work your fair share of the market.  With 8 farms, this meant that each farm had to work approximately one market per month for our June through October season.  </div>
<div>We survived year one with a great response from the community and ran a profitable enterprise.  Farmers made money and the community experienced a huge uptick in access to fresh, local, healthy, and affordable produce.  </div>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Red Elm Café is the brain-child of three sisters living in
the Hilltop neighborhood of Tacoma, Wash. What started as a dream of buying a
coffee shop to run, quickly turned into a dream of creating a place in <i>our</i> neighborhood where people could meet
with friends over good food.</p>
<p>This is a big dream that has been in the making for
two years. It is a dream for a community gathering place in the neighborhood we
love. It is a dream for a bacon cheddar waffle and a really great cappuccino on
a Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>Red Elm Café will be the mom and pop (or sister and sister
and sister) home away from home—where the place smells like espresso and
blueberry muffins and the staff is happy to see you (the staff is us and we
will be happy to see you).</p>
<p>Two years ago we started planning and searching for a space
to open up shop. In that time we have filled Adina’s garage with refrigerators
and her basement with tables and chairs. We have stacked dishes and high chairs
in Jenn’s office and parked an espresso machine in her laundry room.
And a shiny pile of kitchen sinks greets Sarah at her front door every morning.
We are so ready to move these treasures into our café space and plug in and go,
but we need to make one final push to get us open.</p>
<p>Help us make this dream a reality and get Hilltop a great
place for breakfast and coffee!</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>We are reaching out to our friends and neighbors for support to bring this cafe to Hilltop!</p>
<p>We are looking to raise $25,000 (or more!) to get our espresso counter built in and put up walls for a reservable conference room (you can reserve it for a birthday party, or maybe a business meeting!). We also need to purchase a few last pieces of equipment to bring you the tastiest waffles and sandwiches, plus we need to pay to get the lights on and water running.</p>

<p><b></b></p><h2><b>- DECRYPTION - lexicon</b></h2><br/><b></b><p><b>Encrypted Currency</b></p>
<p><b>Often called</b> <b>crypto currency</b> is a medium of exchange and electronic payment using cryptography to secure the transactions and to control the creation of new monetary units.</p>
<p><b>BlockChain</b></p>
<p>A distributed data store that holds a public ledger of transactions in cryptocurrencies. This record is enforced cryptographically and hosted on machines running the software.</p>
<p><b>P2P or Peer to Peer</b></p>
<p>P2P is a distributed, non-centralized information network in which there is no single server containing the exchanged data. The data is divided and distributed among several copies to all network clients.</p>
<p><b>BTC, XBT, mBTC, µBTC</b></p>
<p>The abbreviated currency code for the bitcoin is BTC or XBT. BTC is an informal acronym as with most crypto-currencies and XBT is the acronym validated by ISO standards. As bitcoins have appreciated in value, it has become increasingly common to work with thousandths or even millionths of bitcoins, which are called millibitcoins (mBTC) and microbitcoins (μBTC), respectively.</p>
<p><b>Satoshi</b></p>
<p>The smallest unit, a hundred millionth of a bitcoin (0.00000001 bitcoin), is called a satoshi in honor of Satoshi Nakamoto</p>
<p>0,00000001BTC.</p>
<p><b>ASIC</b></p>
<p>ASIC stands for Application-Specific Integrated Circuit, which is a microchip designed for a special application. In crypto-currencies, ASICs are used to solve a mining puzzle algorithm, for example, SCRIPT or SHA-256.</p>
<p><b>Mining</b></p>
<p>This refers to the actual creation of currency by the solving of the mining puzzle algorithm.</p>
<p><b>Hash</b></p>
<p>The term «hashing» means how quickly your hardware is processing data from the Blockchain. A hash algorithm turns an arbitrarily-large amount of data into a fixed-length hash. The same hash will always result from the same data, but modifying the data by even one bit will completely change the hash. Like all computer data, hashes are large numbers, and are usually written as hexadecimal.</p>
<p><b>GH/S - Gigahashes/sec</b></p>
<p>The number of hashes calculated in a second. This measures the power of a component or ASIC network.</p>
<p><b>“Mining farms”</b></p>
<p>Large spaces (buildings) combining a number of ASIC generating units blasting powers of the order of Petahash (1000000GH).</p><p><br/></p>

Kodi® is an open source software for which a community of web developers constantly create new features. A wide selection of plugins are available through various portals, and addons are available from most web services.

UPNP (Universal Plug and Play)
With its UPnP compatibility, you can share from/to IOTA. This universal network protocol, allows you to enjoy and share your media to or from any mobile device or computer on your local wireless or Ethernet network.IOTA is also Airplay ready.WHY IOTA ?IOTA is a technology born of the demand to strengthen and support the rapidly increasing number of transactions over the Bitcoin network. Our technology will achieve this by an even distribution of Bitcoin relays around the globe. By multiplying the number of relays throughout the world, the transmission time of Bitcoin transactions will decrease from the present delay of minutes, to just seconds.Bitcoin is a decentralized digital cash system, that differs from all state currencies as bitcoins are not produced by a central bank, but are generated by a digital process called ‘mining’, which takes place in hundreds of datacenters throughout the world, called mining farms. One bitcoin today trades at 241.2 USD, and is created as a reward for payment processing work.All Bitcoin miners offer their computing power to verify and record payments into the public ledger. These users are rewarded with new bitcoins proportional to the amount of computing power they donate to the network. But the public Bitcoin network is also made up of merchants, exchangers, users and other relay nodes. These are essential members of the network who are not compensated for securing and strengthening the network. Your IOTA mediacenter is a paid Bitcoin relay.
To strengthen Bitcoin it is necessary to spread evenly around the globe a great number of transaction relays.
// THE REWARD

When IOTA is ON whether you use it or not it acts as a relay and you get paid !
How ? In bitcoins.
How often ? Daily.
How much is worth one bitcoin ? today: ~$242 USD.
Can you trade it ? yes (www.bitstamp.net).
What could i buy with bitcoins ? Whatever you want or need.How much IOTA pays you ?

The goal of the node is to be online 24/7 and thus can relay transactions in its perimeter. 
By default, IOTA will only use 100kbits/sec IN and OUT (10% of an average dsl line OUT) ~1Mbits/sec).

Thus, the user letting IOTA switched on will be rewarded as a Bitcoin miner owning around 150GH/s mining power. A miner with this computing speed will get rewarded around 1 bitcoin among 36 months*, knowing the payments are on daily basis : 0,001BTC or 100000 Satoshi per day. (One Satoshi is the tiniest fraction of a Bitcoin (0,00000001BTC)).
How does it work ? 

You create a Bitcoin wallet on a platform like Blockchain.info / Coinbase / Paymium ( France ). You fill your Bitcoin wallet address (account number ) in your IOTA interface. See a daily payment satoshis on your interface against part of the  uptime of your IOTA .
It can stay always on because its power consumption is reduced below 30W. IOTA still acts as a relay during media player sessions and do not affect in any way your experience.
IOTA will not mess with your internet bandwidth or your DslTV broadcast because you can set a limit in the usage of your your connection
IOTA’s custom interface will show you the hosted Bitcoin Core activity. It will display the status of the node and activity surrounding it : blockchain size, connected pairs, total bitcoins mined, total number of bit coin nodes, and more…
Today (2015/05/19) one bitcoin can be bought around 240$, its value went from $00 in 2009 to over $1000 in november 2013.
What will 1 bitcoin earned with IOTA be worth in 3 years ?
* estimate of total awards received between 04/15/2015 and 04/15/2018


Who are we ?IOTA is supported by the business startup, Synapse Labs. www.synapse-labs.fr The Synapse Labs is a team of six community-oriented, multimedia specialists and crypto-currency enthusiasts aiming to share the success and benefits of free software through innovative products and services to as many people as possible.With over 15 years experience, our team at Synapse Labs works passionately to leverage our competence in systems integration and security, network engineering, the graphic and media arts, and in all Internet technologies.Our primary objective is to strengthen Bitcoin and make the Bitcoin network more efficient, multiplying the number of active bitcoin relays by distributing a maximum number of units across the globe.Secondly, we offer IOTA users exclusive services and both additional software and hardware features to make the most of the system’s potential.Why do we need your help ?The IOTA project is a community vision, and it is as a community that the IOTA System will succeed. It is in this spirit of community that we are initiating our crowd-funding campaign with INDIEGOGO to raise funds for the completion of the IOTA Project and secure the manufacture of the IOTA box.

- DECRYPTION - lexiconEncrypted Currency
Often called crypto currency is a medium of exchange and electronic payment using cryptography to secure the transactions and to control the creation of new monetary units.
BlockChain
A distributed data store that holds a public ledger of transactions in cryptocurrencies. This record is enforced cryptographically and hosted on machines running the software.
P2P or Peer to Peer
P2P is a distributed, non-centralized information network in which there is no single server containing the exchanged data. The data is divided and distributed among several copies to all network clients.
BTC, XBT, mBTC, µBTC
The abbreviated currency code for the bitcoin is BTC or XBT. BTC is an informal acronym as with most crypto-currencies and XBT is the acronym validated by ISO standards. As bitcoins have appreciated in value, it has become increasingly common to work with thousandths or even millionths of bitcoins, which are called millibitcoins (mBTC) and microbitcoins (μBTC), respectively.
Satoshi
The smallest unit, a hundred millionth of a bitcoin (0.00000001 bitcoin), is called a satoshi in honor of Satoshi Nakamoto
0,00000001BTC.
ASIC
ASIC stands for Application-Specific Integrated Circuit, which is a microchip designed for a special application. In crypto-currencies, ASICs are used to solve a mining puzzle algorithm, for example, SCRIPT or SHA-256.
Mining
This refers to the actual creation of currency by the solving of the mining puzzle algorithm.
Hash
The term «hashing» means how quickly your hardware is processing data from the Blockchain. A hash algorithm turns an arbitrarily-large amount of data into a fixed-length hash. The same hash will always result from the same data, but modifying the data by even one bit will completely change the hash. Like all computer data, hashes are large numbers, and are usually written as hexadecimal.
GH/S - Gigahashes/sec
The number of hashes calculated in a second. This measures the power of a component or ASIC network.
“Mining farms”
Large spaces (buildings) combining a number of ASIC generating units blasting powers of the order of Petahash (1000000GH).

<p><b>***Just one day to go, now is the
time to show your support.***</b></p>
<p>I've been getting really great
feedback about our concept and we've had an outstanding amount of traffic on
the site in the last few days. Thanks to everyone I met at Paleofx in Austin
for taking the time to look us up and check out our story.</p>
<p>We want to make low-carb options as
easy as getting your favorite cup of coffee! Consider contributing the amount
of your favorite cup of coffee. We believe in truth and wisdom and want to give
you more control of your food choices and make it easier for you and family to
enjoy the benefits of a low-carb diet. </p>
<p>Participation at just one dollar will demonstrate support.
Now is the time to make it happen. Thank you for helping us reach our
goal!</p>

<p></p> <p></p>
<p>We want to open a shop serving delicious low-carb food that is convenient when you are short on time. We all know where to find fast food, but we want healthy fast food. We want to open <b>Tambourine </b>where everything we serve is low-carb (gluten-free and sugar-free too!), delicious, and reliable: your go-to on the go. Our name comes from being inspired by music and travel. Tambourines make us happy and we like to eat foods that make us happy too! We will offer food that both tastes good and makes us feel good!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Low-carb diets are already preferred by many people. A diet with low-carbs and healthy fats helps
regulate blood sugar, energy, moods, and weight. With current options, it's not always easy to come by.</p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our mission is to give you more control of of what you eat by making delicious low-carb meals readily available while living our busy lives.</b></p>

<h3><b><b>Why IndieGoGo?</b></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>For everyone who understands low-carb high-fat eating, many
people think it’s crazy because it contradicts the dietary guidelines from the last 40 years. Have you or someone you know ever had success with
low-carb eating? It can be hard to maintain because sugar and carbs have become
so pervasive in our eating habits. Tambourine offers all low-carb options, so
you can enjoy everything without feeling guilty or worrying about the consequences.</p>
<p>We need the wisdom of crowds to help get this idea off the
ground as shown in this presentation by Tom Naughton:<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzPnnDDCIjo&amp;feature=youtu.be"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzPnnDDCIjo&amp;feature=youtu.be<span><br/></span></a><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">He had an alternate title called, “Why people looking for health advice are
turning away from doctors, nutritionists, government agencies, medical trade
organizations, and other established authorities and are instead getting
information from bloggers, podcasters, independent filmmakers, and countless
other dedicated amateurs who communicate through social media.”</span></p>
<p>Our great-grandparents knew about sensible eating, so did athletic
trainers and doctors of their generation; it’s time to bring this wisdom back and we need everyone
to be a part of it.</p>
<p>It's about community. We want to build community together and offer something new!  In fact, we have decided to donate a portion of our proceeds from this campaign to the Edgewood Center for Children and Families and the UCSF Pediatric Obesity Clinic.</p>

</div></div>","***Just one day to go, now is the
time to show your support.***
I've been getting really great
feedback about our concept and we've had an outstanding amount of traffic on
the site in the last few days. Thanks to everyone I met at Paleofx in Austin
for taking the time to look us up and check out our story.
We want to make low-carb options as
easy as getting your favorite cup of coffee! Consider contributing the amount
of your favorite cup of coffee. We believe in truth and wisdom and want to give
you more control of your food choices and make it easier for you and family to
enjoy the benefits of a low-carb diet. 
Participation at just one dollar will demonstrate support.
Now is the time to make it happen. Thank you for helping us reach our
goal!
Our Story
 
We want to open a shop serving delicious low-carb food that is convenient when you are short on time. We all know where to find fast food, but we want healthy fast food. We want to open Tambourine where everything we serve is low-carb (gluten-free and sugar-free too!), delicious, and reliable: your go-to on the go. Our name comes from being inspired by music and travel. Tambourines make us happy and we like to eat foods that make us happy too! We will offer food that both tastes good and makes us feel good!


Low-carb diets are already preferred by many people. A diet with low-carbs and healthy fats helps
regulate blood sugar, energy, moods, and weight. With current options, it's not always easy to come by.
Our mission is to give you more control of of what you eat by making delicious low-carb meals readily available while living our busy lives.

                             

Why are low-carb options important? 


Scientific research shows physical and mental health benefits when carbohydrate consumption is reduced. Our son was 7 years old when he was diagnosed with a mental illness. After several years of medications and therapies, it was the low-carb eating plan that brought us real hope in managing his symptoms. We have experienced so many benefits from the low-carb lifestyle including having more energy and more mental clarity.  

Low-carb diets have been shown to improve symptoms of the following mental and physical conditions: ADHD, anxiety and stress, chronic headaches and migraines, depression, diabetes, epilepsy, focus and concentration problems, inflammatory conditions and diseases (arthritis), insomnia, intestinal problems, gluten sensitivity, memory problems related to preliminary Alzheimer’s, mood disorders, overweight and obesity, Tourette’s, and more. -Perlmutter, David, Grain Brain, Little, Brown and Company, New York, 2013.

Families, athletes, professionals, and others are looking for healthy low-carb food options!




                 



Why IndieGoGo?

For everyone who understands low-carb high-fat eating, many
people think it’s crazy because it contradicts the dietary guidelines from the last 40 years. Have you or someone you know ever had success with
low-carb eating? It can be hard to maintain because sugar and carbs have become
so pervasive in our eating habits. Tambourine offers all low-carb options, so
you can enjoy everything without feeling guilty or worrying about the consequences.
We need the wisdom of crowds to help get this idea off the
ground as shown in this presentation by Tom Naughton:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzPnnDDCIjo&feature=youtu.beHe had an alternate title called, “Why people looking for health advice are
turning away from doctors, nutritionists, government agencies, medical trade
organizations, and other established authorities and are instead getting
information from bloggers, podcasters, independent filmmakers, and countless
other dedicated amateurs who communicate through social media.”
Our great-grandparents knew about sensible eating, so did athletic
trainers and doctors of their generation; it’s time to bring this wisdom back and we need everyone
to be a part of it.
It's about community. We want to build community together and offer something new!  In fact, we have decided to donate a portion of our proceeds from this campaign to the Edgewood Center for Children and Families and the UCSF Pediatric Obesity Clinic.
Contribute now and we can get the word out together!

Support for Tambourine


Nina Teicholz, best selling author of The Big Fat Surprise, supports our idea and contributed at the founder level.  

Here's what some people have been saying about a low-carb diet and Tambourine:

""This is a great idea! I can't believe it doesn't exist already. I am always frustrated when I can't find low-carb options. I needed Tambourine yesterday."" - Renee, executive coach, Arizona
""Switching to low-carb meals was like waking up from a coma."" - Dave, software engineer, San Francisco

“I do it because I want better health. It doesn’t change my previous diet, Just removed some part.” - Rie, speech pathologist, Japan
""I used to do it, but then it was too hard to find the right food and I didn't have enough time."" - Maria, nail salon owner, San Francisco
Your donation is important to make Tambourine a reality. We are committed that everything we offer will be low in carbohydrate content. Our dishes will be made with natural, antibiotic-free, GMO-free, and gluten-free ingredients. There will be a range of dishes from vegetarian to dairy-free and more so that everyone can get what they know is best for them and it will be quick and easy! Even better, the food we serve will be so tasty that everyone will want to come and enjoy it.

                     

What We Need 

While our long-term goal remains the same, to open a storefront, this initial campaign will help us with our first step to
open a pop-up restaurant this year. We have a potential location near Golden Gate Park
that we are very excited about! 
Contribute now and for $25, you will get a $100 gift certificate to be redeemed when we open! Tell your friends so they can get this special offer too. This will only be available for a limited time!
For $100, your name will be along side Nina Teicholz and others on Founder's Wall in our shop and on our website. 
Check out our family dinner special and get a preview of our tasty options!
Tambourine offers you familiar favorites prepared without carbs and without having to do all the research and time-consuming food preparations. That is something you can count on!








We are passionate about this idea and we are committed to making Tambourine a reality for everyone to enjoy. We understand the value and benefits of low-carb living and want to make it accessible for everyone.
When you contribute today you get to help develop the idea. You will be a part of Tambourine as we build the business from concept to reality.

</div></div>","Brief summary


We launch the funding ""HELP FOR HELPERS"" to help cover the daily costs of volunteers.
Numerous tourists coming for holidays become volunteers and help a lot where they can, resident or ex-pat volunteer on site and bring a value manual and logistical help, spending money (e.g. for gas) and energy, some other volunteers pay out of their own pockets for trip, accommodation, food, transport... just to come and to help (mostly a lot). Some of them take special leaves without pay. Others cannot afford a hotel's room and have to camp.

I, Frederic Morlet (https://es.linkedin.com/in/fredmorlet), and my wife Ceyda Goral (https://es.linkedin.com/in/ceydagoralmorlet) volunteer for UNICEF in Spain (delegación Baleares). Watching the catastrophic situation of refugees in Greece, we took the initiative to go to Lesvos last summer and to help refugees on the field during almost 3 months mainly in the refugee transit camp of Kara Tepe on Lesvos, but also in Moria, and in Turkey. We dedicated ourself to interact directly with
refugees, improving or organizing the distribution of non-food items, collecting
information for NGOs and collaborating effectively with them.

We suggested elements to improve the camp and implement solutions (e. g. to avoid that
people take advantage of refugees in the camp...), and provided refugees
basic hygiene and WASH advices and answered, when possible, all questions based
on Dublin III, they may have regarding Europe or life conditions in the different countries.

Since we're back to Spain, we decided to continue our action while helping international volunteers before they come. We federated within 2
weeks more than 700 sympathizers, volunteers, donors, NGOs, activists, and UN-staff... on our Facebook page (Volunteers-coordination Lesvos),
and coordinate thus crowd-funding actions, propose improvement solutions for
refugees, organize the logistic upstream, search for survival items providers etc...
Volunteers are an indispensable cluster of the
humanitarian assistance. Their daily contribution on the field is enormous.
They are for example still the only helpers at the arriving of the numerous boats of
refugees in the north of Lesvos. That's the reason why we dedicate
currently to support them on the island. This initiative is important in terms
of assuring their stay and facilitate their work and logistic.
What volunteers do

Their work is very useful in terms of strengthening the coordination between different structures on the island and due to the daily interaction giving a certain confidence to refugees who feel themselves completely unsecure. 
Today this situation led us to create a task consisting of coordination and camp management. We created an official Facebook page (...) where all NGOs and helpers gather for all information requested to help in Lesvos. This initiative facilitated the task of each group of volunteers and also drew the attention of volunteers from all over the world wanting to help us in Lesvos. Each day demand increases. 

We took the opportunity to
create a volunteers network to be able to organize their arrivals on the island
and place them to appropriate tasks between groups taking action. We
established effective relations with local and diverse other organizations
(Mayor of Lesvos, IRC, Christian Peacemaker Teams, MDM, Red-Cross Greece and Belgium, Village
of all together...)
active on the island. We collaborate with them in order to bring our help in
the refugee camp of Kara Tepe. Here are some examples of our help to the extent
of our means:



Photo: Volunteers prepare and offer warm meals in Kara Tepe for 900 refugees




Crowd-funding to buy draw and color kits for children and distribution in the camp


Buying and distributing in the camp of olive oil soaps


Giving WASH instructions to refugees


Camp cleaning


Storage and sorting out of received items


Identifying of sick children and report them to MDM and MSF


Interpreting work for MDM (Turkish – English)


Shelter allocation


Giving info on their stay in Lesvos, their trip to Athens and on life in general in European countries


Daily interaction with refugees


Chasing the merchants trafficking currencies in the camp and taking advantage of refugees


Summary Report to IOM

What volunteers need


This initiative concerns all volunteers. In order to
strengthen our solidarity with them and also bring more contribution to refugees, we suggest a crowd-funding to ""help the helpers"". The funds collected
will be used to cover their basic needs like accommodation, food, or gasoline. 



We suggest the following sharing out:1) For
volunteers on holidays or resident on the island, the providing of the food on the field + gas + car's repair when necessary (some helpers use their private car to transport refugees covering until hundreds of kilometres a day)


Photo: Thom's car broken, after having transported during months numerous refugees from Molyvos to the registering points in Mytilini


Food and gas, or a daily forfeit (8 EUR)

2) For
specialized volunteers and volunteers coming on purpose and taking special leave without pay, at least:



Accommodation (in a shared house), or a daily forfeit (5 EUR)


Their
food for the whole stay, or a daily forfeit (5 EUR)


The
transportation by bus on the island, or a daily forfeit (3 EUR)







Lots of volunteers accept to help in very limited conditions, and sleep in tents because they can’t afford rooms. Some volunteers simply cannot join us by lack of money.




How you can help
3,000 Euro would help us to fit out a big house in Mytilini and host until 12 volunteers for 50 euro/each per month. 
With 6,000 Euro we fit out a big house in Mytilini, can host until 12 volunteers for free, and provide gas and food also for the resident volunteers during 1 month. 
With 9,000 Euro we fit out a big house in Mytilini, can host until 12 volunteers for free, provide gas and food also for the resident volunteers during 2 months, and have Thom's car repaired.

<p>Hi, I’m
romance author AJ Harmon and I’d like you to help me help survivors of
domestic violence.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I’ve written two books that have changed my life. I’ve written 15 total, and I love them all,
but two have really had an impact on my life: First Class to New York, my very first
book, and A Choice for Claire, the novel I published in February, 2015. </p>
<p>A Choice for
Claire has touched my life and the lives of thousands of readers and it has
awoken me to the sad reality that thousands of women and children who are
survivors of domestic violence need help finding safety and starting over. </p>

I want to help them, like Rebekah helps Claire in my book. But the need is too big for one person or even a dozen people to
handle alone. So I'm asking you to join us.<br/>

<div>
<b>Mélanie GEISER (Chargée des Opérations) : </b>a travaillé dans le milieu humanitaire pendant 6 années dans les domaines de la logistique, des finances et des ressources humaines. Elle a été Directrice Pays d'une ONG Suisse ces deux dernières années en Haïti . </div>
<div>
<b>Laure BOTTINELLI (Fondatrice): </b>En tant que spécialiste Eau, Assainissement et Hygiène dans le milieu humanitaire, Laure a passé ces 5 dernières années au sein de différentes ONG afin de faciliter l'accès a l'eau, l'hygiène et l'assainissement pour les plus démunis. </div>
<div>
<b>Julie ALA (Chargée Communication):</b> Consultante en communication depuis 4 années, Julie travaille dans le domaine du graphic design, web marketing et montage vidéo pour des entreprises telles que Dior, Guerlin, Alstom et Coca-Cola. </div>
<div>-----</div>
<div><b>                                        <u>COMMENT TOUT A COMMENCE</u></b></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Depuis plusieurs années, ce projet trottait dans la tête de Laure. Sa passion pour la thématique de l'Eau, l'Assainissement et l'Hygiène associée à son rêve de démarrer sa propre organisation a pris racine en 2014 quand elle a rencontré Mélanie. Pendant une année, elles ont vécu dans la même ville en Haïti et de là est née l'envie de travailler ensemble. Au travers de cette amitié, elles ont rapidement réalisé qu'elles partageaient de nombreuses valeurs humanitaires et souhaitaient avoir un impact sur la croissance d'Haïti en utilisant les mêmes approches. L'une d'entre elles consistait à pérenniser l'accès aux services d'eau potable et d'hygiene pour les plus vulnérables car elles savaient que répondre à ces besoins de base pourrait sauver des milliers de vie. <br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Julie et Laure sont amies depuis leurs années universitaires. Elles sont restées proches et se sont soutenues mutuellement dans leurs projets et leurs  aspirations. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>En Juin 2015, Julie, Mélanie et Laure se sont rencontrées en Haïti pour la première fois et ont discuté plus en profondeur de leur envie de commencer une initiative de recyclage de savon. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Pour que ce rêve devienne une réalité, Laure a quitté Haïti en Juillet 2015 et a passé plusieurs mois en Asie du Sud Est avec l'idée de récolter davantage d'informations sur les méthodes de fabrication de recyclage de savon. A Bali et au Cambodge, elle est allée à la rencontre d'organisations de recyclage de savon prospères qui l'ont aidée à comprendre leurs activités et modes de fonctionnement. C'est à partir de ce moment qu'elle était convaincu: ceci pouvait aussi fonctionner en Haïti. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>En Janvier 2016, elle est retournée en Haïti, prête à commencer cette nouvelle aventure avec Julie et Mélanie.... et ANACAONA est né ! </div>
<div>

                                                 <b><u>NOS LIEUX DE TRAVAIL</u></b>
</div>
<div><b><u><br/></u></b></div>
<div>ANACAONA travaille en Haïti sur 3 zones géographiques: Jacmel, Port-au-Prince et la Côte-des-Arcadins. Dans les prochains mois, nous souhaitons nous étendre à la zone des Cayes et au Cap-Haitien. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>                                                   <u><b>OU VA VOTRE ARGENT?</b></u> </div>
<div>
<b>Avec 50,000 USD:</b> </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>-<b> 2,500 USD</b>: 100 kits d'hygiène pour des écoles primaires </div>
<div>-<b>5,000 USD</b>: 100 formations d'hygiene pour des professeurs d'écoles primaires</div>
<div>-<b>6,000 USD</b>: 60 filtres à eau pour des écoles et des hôpitaux</div>
<div>-<b>20,500 USD</b>: 12 mois de salaire pour 7 employées </div>
<div>-<b>6,000 USD</b>: Collecte et distribution mensuelle de savon </div>
<div>-<b>10,000 USD</b>: Une année entière de savon pour au moins 5000 écoliers</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>                                                       <u><b>RISQUES ET DEFIS</b></u>
</div>
<div><u><b><br/></b></u></div>
<div>Felicitations d'être arrivé jusqu'ici ! </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Comme vous êtes maintenant l'un de nos plus grands supporters, il est impératif que nous soyons 100% transparentes avec vous...</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Si nous n'atteignons pas notre objectif de 50 000 USD au 16 mai, nous ne serons pas en mesure de maintenir nos activités pour les 12 prochains mois. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Pour ANACANONA, il est important de proposer une solution sur le long terme pour le peuple haïtien et il ne fait aucun sens pour nous de nous arrêter alors que nous commençons à peine. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Imaginez-nous dire à nos écoles partenaires: ""Désolée, nous vous avons aidé pendant 6 mois, mais pour le reste de l'année scolaire, les écoliers n'auront pas de savon..."" </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Imaginez-nous dire à nos employées: ""Désolée mesdames, nous avons été en mesure de vous payer un salaire pour vous et votre famille depuis quelques mois, mais maintenant, nous n'avons pas assez d'argent pour continuer à vous employer...""</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Vous vous demandez alors surement: ""Que devient mon argent si ANACAONA n'atteint pas les 50 000 USD?"" Si tel était le cas, votre aide aura permis au pays d'avoir une aide supplémentaire au niveau de l'accès à l'eau et l'hygiène, dans la mesure où votre contribution aura été mise à profit pour couvrir les frais des premiers mois du projet: les frais d'atelier, les ingredients pour le savon, les distributions de savon et la logistique. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>On aimerait aussi vous dire que nos salaires (Laure, Melanie et Julie) ne sont pas inclus dans les 50,000 USD. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Dernier point, mais non le moindre: la vie en Haïti est un défi quotidien. Après plusieurs années passées à vivre dans ce pays, nous sommes bien conscientes des difficultés et le moins qu'on puisse dire c'est que nous en avons déja surmonté beaucoup! </div>

</div></div>","is a humanitarian aid worker with 6 years of experience in logistics, finance & human resources. She has been the country director of a Swiss Non-Governmental Organization in Haiti for the last 2 years.


As a Water, Sanitation and Hygiene specialist humanitarian worker,Laure has spent the past 5 years of her life working with Non-Governmental Organizations providing clean water, sanitation and hygiene ?to people in need.

is a communications consultant with 4 years of experience working in graphic design, web marketing & video montage for companies such as Dior, Guerlain, Alstom, and Coca Cola.




This project has been in Laure's mind for several years now. Her passion for water, hygiene and sanitation combined with her dream to start her own organization took root in 2014 when she met Melanie. They spent one year working in the same city in Haiti and from there, developed the desire to work together. Through their friendship, they quickly realized they shared many humanitarian aid values and wanted to make an impact on Haiti's growth using the same approaches. One of these approaches was to continue providing access to hygiene and drinkable water to the poorest, as they both knew these basic needs could save thousands of lives.
Julie and Laure have been friends ever since college and have always stayed in touch, supporting each other's hopes and aspirations.  
In June 2015, Julie, Melanie, and Laure met in Haiti for the first time and the three of them discussed further the idea of starting a soap recycling initiative. 
To turn this dream into reality, Laure left Haiti in July 2015 and spent several months in South East Asia, researching soap manufacturing methods. While in Bali and in Cambodia, she met with successful soap recycling organizations who helped her understand their activities and made it clear to her: it could also work in Haiti. 
In January 2016, she came back to Haiti, ready to start this new adventure with Melanie and Julie.... and ANACAONA was born!






      
Haiti is located in the Greater Antilles archipelago of the Caribbean, on the island of Hispaniola, shared with the Dominican Republic.

 The 3 black stars you see on the picture below is where we work currently: Jacmel, Port-au-Prince and Cotes des Arcadins. In the coming months, we are hoping to expand to Cap-Haitian and Les Cayes Region.

       Congratulations! You have made it this far! As you are now among our biggest supporters, it's imperative that we be 100% transparent with you...If we do not raise 50,000 USD by May 16th, we will not be able to sustain our activities for the next 12 months. ANACAONA is interested in providing a long term solution for the Haitian people and it would make no sense for us to stop just as we are getting started! Imagine us telling our schools partners: ""Sorry, we have helped you for 6 months, but for the rest of the school year, the children will have no soap..."" Imagine us telling our women employees: ""Sorry ladies, we have been able to provide a salary for you and your family for the past few months but now we have no money left to continue..."" You may then ask yourself, ""What happens to my money if the girls are not able to raise 50,000 dollars?"" if this is the case, you will have allowed the country a head start in health and hygiene, for your donation will have been put to use for the costs incurred during the first months of the project: workshop expenses, soap ingredients, soap donation, and logistics. 
And oh, for what it's worth , our salaries (Melanie, Laure and Julie) are not included in the 50,000 USD.
Last but not least: life in Haiti is challenging. After several years spent living in the country, we are well aware of the daily difficulties and we have already overcome many of them to say the least ! Even though Haiti is often in the press for its turmoil, we believe it is now the time to give the country a sustainable chance.

  / VERSION FRANCAISE: 
                                               L'EQUIPE ANACAONA


Mélanie GEISER (Chargée des Opérations) : a travaillé dans le milieu humanitaire pendant 6 années dans les domaines de la logistique, des finances et des ressources humaines. Elle a été Directrice Pays d'une ONG Suisse ces deux dernières années en Haïti . 

Laure BOTTINELLI (Fondatrice): En tant que spécialiste Eau, Assainissement et Hygiène dans le milieu humanitaire, Laure a passé ces 5 dernières années au sein de différentes ONG afin de faciliter l'accès a l'eau, l'hygiène et l'assainissement pour les plus démunis. 

Julie ALA (Chargée Communication): Consultante en communication depuis 4 années, Julie travaille dans le domaine du graphic design, web marketing et montage vidéo pour des entreprises telles que Dior, Guerlin, Alstom et Coca-Cola.

                                        COMMENT TOUT A COMMENCE

Depuis plusieurs années, ce projet trottait dans la tête de Laure. Sa passion pour la thématique de l'Eau, l'Assainissement et l'Hygiène associée à son rêve de démarrer sa propre organisation a pris racine en 2014 quand elle a rencontré Mélanie. Pendant une année, elles ont vécu dans la même ville en Haïti et de là est née l'envie de travailler ensemble. Au travers de cette amitié, elles ont rapidement réalisé qu'elles partageaient de nombreuses valeurs humanitaires et souhaitaient avoir un impact sur la croissance d'Haïti en utilisant les mêmes approches. L'une d'entre elles consistait à pérenniser l'accès aux services d'eau potable et d'hygiene pour les plus vulnérables car elles savaient que répondre à ces besoins de base pourrait sauver des milliers de vie. 


Julie et Laure sont amies depuis leurs années universitaires. Elles sont restées proches et se sont soutenues mutuellement dans leurs projets et leurs  aspirations. 

En Juin 2015, Julie, Mélanie et Laure se sont rencontrées en Haïti pour la première fois et ont discuté plus en profondeur de leur envie de commencer une initiative de recyclage de savon. 

Pour que ce rêve devienne une réalité, Laure a quitté Haïti en Juillet 2015 et a passé plusieurs mois en Asie du Sud Est avec l'idée de récolter davantage d'informations sur les méthodes de fabrication de recyclage de savon. A Bali et au Cambodge, elle est allée à la rencontre d'organisations de recyclage de savon prospères qui l'ont aidée à comprendre leurs activités et modes de fonctionnement. C'est à partir de ce moment qu'elle était convaincu: ceci pouvait aussi fonctionner en Haïti. 

En Janvier 2016, elle est retournée en Haïti, prête à commencer cette nouvelle aventure avec Julie et Mélanie.... et ANACAONA est né ! 

                                            
                                                 NOS LIEUX DE TRAVAIL


ANACAONA travaille en Haïti sur 3 zones géographiques: Jacmel, Port-au-Prince et la Côte-des-Arcadins. Dans les prochains mois, nous souhaitons nous étendre à la zone des Cayes et au Cap-Haitien. 

                                                   OU VA VOTRE ARGENT? 

Avec 50,000 USD: 

- 2,500 USD: 100 kits d'hygiène pour des écoles primaires 
-5,000 USD: 100 formations d'hygiene pour des professeurs d'écoles primaires
-6,000 USD: 60 filtres à eau pour des écoles et des hôpitaux
-20,500 USD: 12 mois de salaire pour 7 employées 
-6,000 USD: Collecte et distribution mensuelle de savon 
-10,000 USD: Une année entière de savon pour au moins 5000 écoliers

                                                       RISQUES ET DEFIS


Felicitations d'être arrivé jusqu'ici ! 

Comme vous êtes maintenant l'un de nos plus grands supporters, il est impératif que nous soyons 100% transparentes avec vous...

Si nous n'atteignons pas notre objectif de 50 000 USD au 16 mai, nous ne serons pas en mesure de maintenir nos activités pour les 12 prochains mois. 

Pour ANACANONA, il est important de proposer une solution sur le long terme pour le peuple haïtien et il ne fait aucun sens pour nous de nous arrêter alors que nous commençons à peine. 

Imaginez-nous dire à nos écoles partenaires: ""Désolée, nous vous avons aidé pendant 6 mois, mais pour le reste de l'année scolaire, les écoliers n'auront pas de savon..."" 

Imaginez-nous dire à nos employées: ""Désolée mesdames, nous avons été en mesure de vous payer un salaire pour vous et votre famille depuis quelques mois, mais maintenant, nous n'avons pas assez d'argent pour continuer à vous employer...""

Vous vous demandez alors surement: ""Que devient mon argent si ANACAONA n'atteint pas les 50 000 USD?"" Si tel était le cas, votre aide aura permis au pays d'avoir une aide supplémentaire au niveau de l'accès à l'eau et l'hygiène, dans la mesure où votre contribution aura été mise à profit pour couvrir les frais des premiers mois du projet: les frais d'atelier, les ingredients pour le savon, les distributions de savon et la logistique. 

On aimerait aussi vous dire que nos salaires (Laure, Melanie et Julie) ne sont pas inclus dans les 50,000 USD. 

Dernier point, mais non le moindre: la vie en Haïti est un défi quotidien. Après plusieurs années passées à vivre dans ce pays, nous sommes bien conscientes des difficultés et le moins qu'on puisse dire c'est que nous en avons déja surmonté beaucoup! 

                                       NOUS AVONS BESOIN DE VOUS MAINTENANT!

<p>The first time I submitted
a story for publication, I waited for months before receiving a polite form
letter rejecting my story. With no idea why it wasn’t chosen, I submitted it to
a different publisher with the same results. After several attempts, I made a
few minor modifications and submitted again. This time it was selected for
publication, but I never knew if it was because of my changes or if the editor
would have liked the original just as well.</p>
<p>Years later, I was working at a prominent literary magazine and saw first hand how their selection process worked. They would go through hundreds of manuscripts in a day and reject many of them on first glance. They didn’t spend the time to really examine a story. Then Interns stuffed a copy of the form letter into the envelope and send it to the writer. Only occasionally would the editor take the time to write a personal note to a rejected author. One such author waited almost a year and received a message saying, “Close. Please submit again.” The problem is, they just didn’t have the staff or the time to do it differently.</p>

<p>Call us crazy, but the
staff here at Mad Cats Press wants to start a traditional publishing company,
but run it in a very non-traditional way. Starting with the selection process.
We plan to evaluate each manuscript carefully so that we can provide feedback
to the authors. This way the author will have an idea why we didn’t choose
their work, and more importantly, what they can do that might improve their
story and get it published.</p>
<p>We’re not expecting every
manuscript to be perfect. We know that isn’t possible. Everyone on our staff is
an experienced writer and editor and we know how much work goes into writing.
What we want to do is to help authors produce the best manuscript possible and
realize their dream.</p>
<p>That brings us to the
next way we plan to be a little different. We also plan to offer editing and
design services to writers that might want a little help. With the popularity
of self-publishing continually rising, the amount of virtually unreadable books
rise with it. It’s not because the stories are bad, it’s because they haven’t
been professionally edited. After writing and revising a manuscript, it is very
hard for an author to catch their own errors. Stories sometimes contain subtle
problems with the storyline or important details go missing. Simple mistakes in
grammar and spelling are common. Too many of these mistakes become distracting
and cause many readers to stop reading a book altogether. That’s why books need
to be professionally edited before publication.</p>
<p>This is where Mad Cats
Press can help. Our content editors can carefully inspect a manuscript for
problems and suggest minor changes that could significantly improve the work.
After revisions are made, our copy editors can go through and check
punctuation, grammar, spelling, and detail accuracy to polish the manuscript
prior to making it into a book. Our artists and designers can even create book
covers or do internal book design if that’s what an author wants. Even if all
that is needed is a simple proofread, we plan to make any of our services
available to those who desire them.</p>

faceless publisher that just produces books. We want to be a part of all
aspects of the process and help the writing community as a whole.</p>
<p>To do all of this, we’re
going to need your help. Starting a small press from the ground up is
expensive. There are legal costs, fees, licenses, equipment, software, and
numerous other expenses we need to cover before we can get started. Not to
mention production costs for the first round of books. Because of this, we’ve
started a crowd funding campaign with three goals in mind. If we can raise
$10,000 we’ll have enough money to get started. This will allow us to cover
initial expenses and start the editing and manuscript selection process. At
this level, the first year will be a real struggle, but we can make it with
enough hard work and clients.   Our next major goal is raising $20,000. At
this level we can get everything we need to produce audio books as well as the
print books and ebooks. Our ultimate goal is to raise $50,000. This would be
enough to get everything we need, but would also cover printing, marketing, and
production costs for our first year of operation. We need to produce at least
six books in our first year, but the more money we raise, the more books we can
produce.</p>
<p>We hope you’ll consider
donating to help us get the press started. Our rewards list consists of some
Mad Cats Press branded swag, book preorders, invitations to our first book
release party, and discounted editing services. If you are able to donate $300
or more and are not interested in the editing services, please let us know when
we contact you and we will be happy to issue you books instead.</p>

would like to help, but can’t afford to help us financially. If this is the
case, there is still an important roll you can play. Spread the word. Tell your
friends and colleagues. Share this on your social media feeds. Use the Indiegogo
share tools. The only way we’ll succeed is with your help.</p>

The Mad Hopyard, Naples, NYIn the spring of 2014, MadHops Founder Peter Hanley planted a hopyard in the Finger Lakes region of New York state, a center of fine wine and beer-making.

<p><b>HELLO! </b>Welcome to Tori Ramen's humble beginning. We are very excited to bring you a whole new bird to the art form of Japanese ramen. Wait...what does that mean you ask? Well, ramen by ""tradition"" consists of a broth made from pork bones cooked over long periods of time as you may already know. For you ramen geeks, this means it will produce rich and velvety tonkotsu, a balanced shoyu, or a very flavorful miso soup. </p>
<p>4/19 UPDATE#1: Our funding is nearly complete. Though we didn't get our funding goal, we are still going to open the restaurant. Our lease is signed and were ready and motivated to bring you the best ramen shop ever. Please stay informed with our Facebook page for more info. </p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p><b>WHAT WE DO:</b> Our spin on ramen will bring you a soup that can achieve the same results with chicken and other birds, hence Tori (<i>bird in Japanese)...</i>made from the best ingredients available. Think Kadjen and Wild Acres Farms. At Tori, we also want to bring you food that we value and care about. This means you will not see corn syrup, artificial flavors or colors, GMO's, or MSG. We also love the challenge of creating a vegetarian made broth, so 'veggies' have no fear, we are looking out for you too!</p>
<p><b>OUR BACKGROUND: </b>Asiya and I got our start at United Noodles during the Minneapolis Ramen Revolution and brought you Ramen Mondays at United Noodles. We took over the Unideli and produced Minnesota's first hits such as ""Tantanmen"", ""Tonkotsu Black"", Tsukemen, and the ever popular ""DRAMEN"". We believe 2016 is our year to make a mark on the city for what we hope to be many years in the making. </p>

<h4><b>THE NAME: (significance)</b></h4>
<p>Tori Ramen is not just unique in name and practice. Tori, short for Victoria is a name we settled on when we found out we were have a baby girl due in late July.This is all great news to us and we hope you will be excited to have our family in the Twin Cities serving you the best ramen you may ever have!</p>
<h4>WANTS VS. NEEDS: (bare essentials)</h4>
<p>Tori Ramen, like any other restaurant or business needs funding. We are going to invest every dollar we have accumulated over the past few years to bring you our dream, but we will need your help in getting there. We don't want a hand out though, so we intend to give back what you give us in the form of fantastic food, and superior service to boot. To keep our costs low, Asiya and I are going to do the build out in house with our own bare hands. We are going to look for the best possible prices on equipment and economical materials. This will keep our project at a minimum of 22-30k. We have a great building picked out with a super nice landlord in the purrrfect area. </p>
</div><div> <h4>THE IMPACT: (rooted in the community)</h4>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We value honest food, great experiences, and helping others. This is not an understatement in any sense. Our morals are in line with the way food began, and the way it should be to this day, cruelty free and non modified. To pair with this, we believe in celebration with food and drink, and giving back what we receive to the community and others that are on the same path as us. A portion of our proceeds will go back to enrich the neighborhood and help young entrepreneurs in food and arts. </span></p>
<h4>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES: (determination)</h4>
</div><div> <p>We have learned so much in the past year, that it has given us great insight into the how and what we need to make this a success. It has literally taken us to rock bottom and back up again. We've endured so many challenges in the planning and execution of this business model, from the search of partnerships and investors, to raising capitol, and finally deciding that the best coarse of action is through our own means, with our own ideas at the forefront. </p>
<p>Though funding is the most important part in any restaurant, we also know that there a lot more contributing factors involved such as acquiring all necessary licenses and permits (registration, building permits, food inspection, liquor license, plumbing) the restaurants build out/remodel, equipment sourcing, vendor sourcing, and hiring staff. </p>
<p>All of this is undoubtably a huge task to take on - all before the doors even open. Once open, we face more obstacles in becoming an established restaurant, and sustaining a foothold in St Paul. Our business will be live in August of this year to give us the time we need to open and lay the roots. </p>
<p>Thankfully, having the experience working in restaurants has enabled us to recognize each arising set back that may occur. We have been part of restaurant openings, build outs, and have attained knowledge that will be key in opening our own restaurant. We have learned that one of the biggest issues in opening a restaurant is patience. Having the patience to not rush the opening, waiting for the state departments to approve licensing, setting up social media, building the restaurants floor plan, and making sure everything is in place before opening so as to have a strong start. We know we can make the Twin Cities proud!</p> </div> <div> <h4>WE NEED YOU! (thank you)</h4> <p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help...</p>

</h3>
<p>Smartroad Tools (tm) is a system to test and monitor highways and other high-value infrastructure for hidden damage.</p>
<p>Roads, highways, airport runways, railways, and levees (dikes) consist of multiple layers resting on an earthen subbase. Over time, erosion, nearby construction, weather, seismic activity, and other causes can create gaps in this subbase. There is no sign of this on the surface, until a collapse suddenly occurs. This collapse leads to expenses for immediate repair, costs to the surrounding communities due to disruption of transport, environmental and property damage, and human casualties.<br/></p>
<p>At present there is no practical way to monitor the condition of the earthen subbase. We have invented a ""smart"" material which is embedded during construction or reconstruction, and which provides a fast and easy-to-use way to check the subbase.<br/></p>
<p>In addition to roads and highways, this technology is applicable to flood prevention levees, railways, tunnels, and airport runways. In some cases this technology may apply to oil and gas pipelines, to mining waste ponds, to bridges and highway overpasses, and to high-security buildings such as bank vaults and nuclear power plants.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Who We Are<br/>
</h3>We are computer specialists who have been designing and building computer software and hardware for many years. One of our specialities is geospatial analysis - processing information usually acquired from earth satellites or GPS, and building geographic information and computer mapping systems.<p>Smartroad Tools (patents applied for) is a radical departure from traditional geospatial methods. No satellites are involved - it all happens here on earth - yet it still uses our image processing and data analysis expertise.</p>

</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Right now, we need exposure. Tell your friends about us. Better yet, tell your Congressperson about us.</p>
<p>We have several presentations lined up over the next few months at international conferences. At these events, we can show our technology to scientists, industry leaders, and government decision-makers. Unfortunately exhibits at these conferences cost a bundle. We're asking you to help send us to these conferences: in London, in Stockholm, in Korea, and in the U.S. If we do not reach our target, we will go to as many of the events as we can afford. If we exceed the target, the money will go for other, future events and for advancing our research and development. Please contact us with questions or suggestions. We try to reply within 3 days.</p>

</div></div>","Smartroad ToolsEarly Warnings of Pavement and Dike Failure

Smartroad Tools (tm) is a system to test and monitor highways and other high-value infrastructure for hidden damage.
Roads, highways, airport runways, railways, and levees (dikes) consist of multiple layers resting on an earthen subbase. Over time, erosion, nearby construction, weather, seismic activity, and other causes can create gaps in this subbase. There is no sign of this on the surface, until a collapse suddenly occurs. This collapse leads to expenses for immediate repair, costs to the surrounding communities due to disruption of transport, environmental and property damage, and human casualties.
At present there is no practical way to monitor the condition of the earthen subbase. We have invented a ""smart"" material which is embedded during construction or reconstruction, and which provides a fast and easy-to-use way to check the subbase.
In addition to roads and highways, this technology is applicable to flood prevention levees, railways, tunnels, and airport runways. In some cases this technology may apply to oil and gas pipelines, to mining waste ponds, to bridges and highway overpasses, and to high-security buildings such as bank vaults and nuclear power plants.

Who We Are
We are computer specialists who have been designing and building computer software and hardware for many years. One of our specialities is geospatial analysis - processing information usually acquired from earth satellites or GPS, and building geographic information and computer mapping systems.Smartroad Tools (patents applied for) is a radical departure from traditional geospatial methods. No satellites are involved - it all happens here on earth - yet it still uses our image processing and data analysis expertise.
                          Sally describes the Smartroad Tools mission
                         Kurt tells how he became interested in collapsing roads

  What We Need & What You Get Right now, we need exposure. Tell your friends about us. Better yet, tell your Congressperson about us.
We have several presentations lined up over the next few months at international conferences. At these events, we can show our technology to scientists, industry leaders, and government decision-makers. Unfortunately exhibits at these conferences cost a bundle. We're asking you to help send us to these conferences: in London, in Stockholm, in Korea, and in the U.S. If we do not reach our target, we will go to as many of the events as we can afford. If we exceed the target, the money will go for other, future events and for advancing our research and development. Please contact us with questions or suggestions. We try to reply within 3 days.

<p>Without the rest of your arm, this in itself causes stress to the shoulder area and back extremities, an effect due to sagging or total weight distribution from the top part of your body–from your shoulders down to your lower back. The result leads to an uncomfortable body posture causing the body to eventually strain and fatigue to the areas.  <i>The lower arm rest are just too low and drivers always tend to rest their arms on the upper door panel, simply because it is more natural height.</i>  <b>With the air cushioned pad, this discomfort is alleviated, as the comfortable arm rest pad slides to your desired position and comfort, reducing the strain to your body, and simply makes you drive more comfortable.  </b></p>

<p>We all spend a lot of time on the road, if you don't sit right, you will notice the small discomforts of the low back, upper back, shoulders, and neck. Leaning against the door will hurt your back in a long run. The air cushioned slidable armrest pad allows you to rest your arm in a more comfortable fashion, thereby giving your body a more relaxed resting position, removing the restless feeling of driving.</p>

<p>The ArmRestor can be fitted along any area of your door panel. The slid-able cushion pad helps to avoid any objects on the door panel without sacrificing the comfort of arm resting. By slightly pressing the release button located in the center of the pad, the pad can slide easily with slight pressure: the pad will move along the base and lock in various preset intervals by releasing the button. The pad can be removed from the uni-body base unit for cleaning purposes. The pad has a slid-able capacity area of about 4-5 inches out from the base ends. </p>

<h3>Questions and Answers:</h3>
<p>Q: I have a big truck, small car, or SUV-will ArmRestor fit it? </p>
<p>A: ArmRestor was made to fit all vehicles types. The hook mechanism expands to allow a universal fit.  The ArmRestor also fits vertically perfect on the interior door pane for a snug fit since the dimensions are standardized in all vehicles between the vertical X axis .</p>
<p>Q: Does the ArmRestor need any adhesives, screws, or other attaching elements? </p>
<p>A: No, the ArmRestor device was developed and patented to allow the unit to station on your door panel without the use of these tools or attachment materials. The lip adjustment allows the device to fit securely &amp; comfortable along any door panel. </p>
<p>Q: Will ArmRestor be intrusive on the side airbags?</p>
<p>A: NO! , the hook mechanism that holds the body's mainframe will give way upon the pressure of the air bag opening if one happens to be in the general area where the ArmRestor is placed, thereby giving the cover to release upon the air bag dispensing. Also it actually happens to be a protectorant in that many covers of the door fly outwardly upon the bag being pressurized and released. This keeps the panel from flying out into the person while the airbag commonly disperses from the bottom upward where it is stored. The ArmRestor does not cover the lower extremities of the cover or where the airbag dispenses from.! </p>
<p>Q: What type of leather ArmRestor is using?</p>
<p>A: Synthetic leather- it is made with high-grade vinyl which is tough and durable, easy to clean and maintain.</p>
<p>Q: Will the ArmRestor look or appear to fit smoothly or look right? </p>
<p>A: Yes, the patented features and ergonomic design fits smoothly on the door panel. The adjustable lip will allow the ArmRestor to press tightly along the door panel for a tight and smooth fit without the lumbered appearance. </p>
<p>Q: Is the ArmRestor permanently positioned on the door panel? </p>
<p>A: NO, it is your choice to leave it there permanently or not. The device is portable and the adjustment mechanisms allow you to easily remove it, reposition it, or replace it back on your door panel. </p>
<p>Q: Can the ArmRestor Device only be on the driver’s side door panel? </p>
<p>A: No, the device was designed &amp; patented to be used as a reversible Armrest and can be used on any one of your door panels. The bottle holder positions on each side of the Device, allowing the bottle tray removed and positioned on either side. This will allow the bottle tray to position in the front. </p>
<p>Q: Can you place the bottle holder on the back end of the Device? </p>
<p>A: Yes, the bottle holder has two positions, one on each end. It is up to the owner to use it to their best intentions. We recommend having the bottle holder rest in the front side for easy access while driving. For passenger use, the bottle holder can be in either position. </p>
<p>Q: Will the Lip scratch the window? </p>
<p>A: No, the material used is plastic. The ergonomically developed Lip avoids the back end from rubbing against your window. </p>
<p>Q: What material is ArmRestor using?</p>
<p>A: The ArmRestor is made of automotive friendly plastics with UV stabilizers and is scratch resistant.</p>
<p>Q: Will a drink spill while driving? </p>
<p>A: No, the design of the bottle holder and unit will withstand road bumps, so it acts as a shock absorber. Your bottle of water will be safe. </p>
<p>Q: Will the drink come out of the bottle holder if I slam the door? </p>
<p>A: It is intended for water bottle, so it will be fine. Let's not slam your door, bad for your car!</p>
<h3><b>Installation instructions</b></h3>
<p>1) Place the ArmRestor in an area along the door panel where it avoids any intrusion of your door latch or door LIP release knob.</p>
<p>2) The best option of inserting the lip of the hook, is to have your window rolled down completely and in some cases, to leave the window slightly visible, then locate the lip between the window and area of your weather stripping, then roll the window up to ensure it is attached properly.</p>
<p>3) The device will comfortably stay in position by simply pressing the body of the ArmRestor against the side of the inside door panel, first by pressing in the hook release button located on the top side of the hook area device: Adjust the hook according to the depth of your door panel. This will ensure the device properly secures against the door base by allowing the adjustable hook attachment to adjust to the depth or thickness of your door panel &amp; allow the device to stay in position with the window open or closed, without coming off.</p>
<p>NOTES: </p>
<p>- Allow the positioning of the ArmRestor along the door panel to avoid interference with the steering wheel, so that you have the most comfortable positioning of the Device. The slidable pad allows you to use the device as close or far from you since the pad feature moves along the base. </p>
<p>- Be diligent where you place the device on the door panel so to avoid the objects that may be on your door panel such as the handle to open the door or the doorknob. </p>
<p>- Before closing or slamming your car door, be sure to remove any drinking cup from the bottle- holder that does not have a lid cover, as precaution, so to avoid the cup from potentially spilling out any liquid. </p>
<p>- Be cautious of drinking hot items placed in your bottle holder as you may unintentionally hit the cup while driving and may burn your hand or leg. Place water bottle only in the bottle holder in the appropriate position.</p>

</div></div>","Today there are over 940 million vehicles on the road worldwide. In the United States alone there are over 240 million vehicles on the road. Worldwide car registrations and owners are increasing at a rate of 6% yearly making the roadways a large venue for recreational driving as well as for everyday usage.  Our goal is to provide the needs that today's vehicles lack.                          ArmRestor Deluxe- the introduction of our Multi-Functional Arm Rest with a Custom Hand Made Stitched Air Cushioned Pad (100% Cotton) that gives your vehicle the look and feel of a unique style and look to your interior. Fits and adjust to all makes and models and offers so many features and functions. Check out the rest of the story to see how the ArmRestor provides the necessities for your Car, SUV,Truck, Van.....
  

  The ArmRestor serves many uses besides a slid-able arm rest, so if you don't fancy the arm rest feature,  the ArmRestor offers other useful purposes for your vehicle. Use it for the driver or use it for the passenger-yes-all features are reversible!! Use it for storing, organizing and dispensing your coins and storage and dispensing of tissues (2 types-large and compact) or use the swiveling cup, bottle and cell phone holder. It like having your own personal service attendant. 
Lets face it, cars get messy and cluttered. Coins are thrown in ash trays, glove compartments or stored in the cup trays.  Making a messy appearance, or worse, glued and stuck to the tray after a coffee or soda spill. Good luck trying to pickup your coins in that mess!!!You can never find the coins you need when you need them. Always looking for spare change for coffee, news paper, tolls-whatever it may be. Simply annoying!!!  
Tissues have  bulky boxes and are thrown in the car, crushed between the driver and passenger seats, stuffed or stuck under the seats, or worse- misplaced in the back somewhere- never in reach when you need it most, when driving. A need for a sneeze, a wipe after a bite , a drip after a sip. Those tissues are never there when in need. 
And we can always use a trilateral cup holder that accommodates bottles, cups and cell-phones. Convenience right at your disposal with its swiveling action. Can't ask for a more personal service when available at a moments notice.

Do you know the distance a distracted driver took his/her eyes off the road for an average of 5 seconds while driving at 60 mph? It could be the entire length of a FOOTBALL FIELD without looking!!  Thousands of people die each year as a result of distraction while driving. Reaching out to something while driving is certainly one of the unnecessary distractions that can be minimized.

                                                   Safety is our Concern


                     



When you ""do not"" correctly positioned in a sitting stance, and rest your arm(s) on an arm rest, you tend to have more drag and weight being placed on your back and shoulders. Simply said, you tend to Sag your body! When correctly using a positioned arm rest, your body posture is in its natural sitting stance. The arm is resting naturally, reducing your back from slouching and shoulders from sagging inwardly while driving. 


Without the rest of your arm, this in itself causes stress to the shoulder area and back extremities, an effect due to sagging or total weight distribution from the top part of your body–from your shoulders down to your lower back. The result leads to an uncomfortable body posture causing the body to eventually strain and fatigue to the areas.  The lower arm rest are just too low and drivers always tend to rest their arms on the upper door panel, simply because it is more natural height.  With the air cushioned pad, this discomfort is alleviated, as the comfortable arm rest pad slides to your desired position and comfort, reducing the strain to your body, and simply makes you drive more comfortable.  

                               






 Drivers like when their vehicles are organized and more importantly, like to have easy access to their daily traveling needs.  No longer thrown displaced coins in the center console or ashtray or crushed displaced tissues.  


                                               Solution- ArmRestor


          
     

            




                             
                            An Ergonomic Design
Parts simply mate without the use of tools, screws or other outside materials. Easy to clean, easy to remove, easy to attach.




                   ArmRestor is an all-in-one armrest solution-a one fix solution so that all of us can enjoy our ride the way it should be. The ArmRestor fits in all vehicle types, providing an easy attachment between the window and weather stripping without any obstruction to your vehicle. The material used for the device is High grade scratch resistant plastic- avoiding damage to the window or the interior of your vehicle. The plastic material can withstand different temperature conditions keeping the longevity of your device.                                      SLEEK, SLENDER, & ELEGANT



                                                              






 
1. Comfort in all weather conditions 

 Nice! but without Armrestor, it is not comfy.
We all spend a lot of time on the road, if you don't sit right, you will notice the small discomforts of the low back, upper back, shoulders, and neck. Leaning against the door will hurt your back in a long run. The air cushioned slidable armrest pad allows you to rest your arm in a more comfortable fashion, thereby giving your body a more relaxed resting position, removing the restless feeling of driving.

                       

                       Raining? You can still enjoy ArmRestor with the window closed!You do not have to wait for a sunny day for a good ride. You can enjoy your ride in a rainy day too!     Even in a small car such as a Cooper (above and below Pic)
2. Safety- Keep your eyes on the road.

          You do not have to reach out to your glove box or the center armrest to get tissues and coins. ArmRestor is in your eyesight and will help you to keep your eyes on the road.
3. Convenience- One central location for your stuff

                       Tissue Dispenser, Coins Dispenser, and Bottle/Phone Holder. You can get a simple upgrade in your car with Armrestor.
4. Easy to use and Tool-less installation
It will take less than a minute to install ArmRestor to your car without any tool. That's right, no tool! A 2 step process. The ArmRestor lip slips into any area on your door panel between the weather stripping & window in an open or closed position. Position the hook and slide in the main body-that is it.

                 


ArmRestor
Deluxe in Black or Creme with a custom hand stitched cloth with                                                            embossed logo                                                            Black with black pad or Creme with dark brown pad
       





 
PAD ADJUSTMENT:

       
The ArmRestor can be fitted along any area of your door panel. The slid-able cushion pad helps to avoid any objects on the door panel without sacrificing the comfort of arm resting. By slightly pressing the release button located in the center of the pad, the pad can slide easily with slight pressure: the pad will move along the base and lock in various preset intervals by releasing the button. The pad can be removed from the uni-body base unit for cleaning purposes. The pad has a slid-able capacity area of about 4-5 inches out from the base ends. 

Hook Adjustment:The universal hook attachment has a unique patented mechanism that allows the expanding and contraction of the hook, permitting the ArmRestor to fit on all vehicle types.>>>insert the video here>>>

Tissue Compartment:

                                                Work flawlessly with Napkins or Pocket Size Tissue

                    

The tissue dispenser holds large household tissues or standard size Kleenex tissues purchased at any shopping grocery center. In the back of device, simply insert the tissues in the center of the inner backside lip. Pull out one tissue to have the tissue exposed through the tissue lip for easy dispensing.
Coin Dispenser:

                   

                   
Holds your quarters, nickels and dimes. Simply insert your coins into the proper coin chambers (Q,N,D) from the front: the puck attaches to a spring, securely holding your coins for disbursement. Removing a coin is simple, just place your finger under the mouth opening and slide the coin out. 
Detachable Bottle/Phone HOLDER:

                 

      
     
                                       
This awesome feature allows you to move the cup to either side tray located at the end of the device. Simply push down the button feature located on the arm base of the cup holder, slide out the cup holder from the tray. To place the cup holder on either side of the unit: simply press down the button feature located on the arm base, and snap the cup holder into the aperture located within the tray.
The bottle holder allows swivel action to accommodate the end user comfort by just moving the bottle holder in a 270-degree fashion with preset locking positions. The ergonomically designed cup holder allows for standard Industry bottles,  cans and Styrofoam cups. The cup holder will tightly hold any drink into position while driving.
The swivel action allows cell phone to be at your fingertips for easy access. Avoid Cell Phone Tickets- or get road side distractions. The cell phone holder allows you to have direct access to your cell phone right where you need it, near your body for easy hearing and one touch finger action.

                 CUP HOLDER HAS MANY USES:
         Hot cups, Sweaty bottles-no more. Protective rim and grip handle

                                                                   Portable-detachable ANYTIME, ANYWHERE

                                      

                   PAD HEIGHT ADJUSTMENT

                           
The ArmRestor has the capability to incline the pad to your comfort level. Now you can have the pad up high or down low!!!! If  the pad is to high for your comfort, simply either raise your seat to accommodate the use of the ArmRestor's pad or lower the pad by pressing the adjustable hook to incline the unit. Caveat: ensure not to incline more then the 2nd or 3rd preposition lock, for a more secure fit and ensure the cup holder is not in use.

Questions and Answers:
Q: I have a big truck, small car, or SUV-will ArmRestor fit it? 
A: ArmRestor was made to fit all vehicles types. The hook mechanism expands to allow a universal fit.  The ArmRestor also fits vertically perfect on the interior door pane for a snug fit since the dimensions are standardized in all vehicles between the vertical X axis .
Q: Does the ArmRestor need any adhesives, screws, or other attaching elements? 
A: No, the ArmRestor device was developed and patented to allow the unit to station on your door panel without the use of these tools or attachment materials. The lip adjustment allows the device to fit securely & comfortable along any door panel. 
Q: Will ArmRestor be intrusive on the side airbags?
A: NO! , the hook mechanism that holds the body's mainframe will give way upon the pressure of the air bag opening if one happens to be in the general area where the ArmRestor is placed, thereby giving the cover to release upon the air bag dispensing. Also it actually happens to be a protectorant in that many covers of the door fly outwardly upon the bag being pressurized and released. This keeps the panel from flying out into the person while the airbag commonly disperses from the bottom upward where it is stored. The ArmRestor does not cover the lower extremities of the cover or where the airbag dispenses from.! 
Q: What type of leather ArmRestor is using?
A: Synthetic leather- it is made with high-grade vinyl which is tough and durable, easy to clean and maintain.
Q: Will the ArmRestor look or appear to fit smoothly or look right? 
A: Yes, the patented features and ergonomic design fits smoothly on the door panel. The adjustable lip will allow the ArmRestor to press tightly along the door panel for a tight and smooth fit without the lumbered appearance. 
Q: Is the ArmRestor permanently positioned on the door panel? 
A: NO, it is your choice to leave it there permanently or not. The device is portable and the adjustment mechanisms allow you to easily remove it, reposition it, or replace it back on your door panel. 
Q: Can the ArmRestor Device only be on the driver’s side door panel? 
A: No, the device was designed & patented to be used as a reversible Armrest and can be used on any one of your door panels. The bottle holder positions on each side of the Device, allowing the bottle tray removed and positioned on either side. This will allow the bottle tray to position in the front. 
Q: Can you place the bottle holder on the back end of the Device? 
A: Yes, the bottle holder has two positions, one on each end. It is up to the owner to use it to their best intentions. We recommend having the bottle holder rest in the front side for easy access while driving. For passenger use, the bottle holder can be in either position. 
Q: Will the Lip scratch the window? 
A: No, the material used is plastic. The ergonomically developed Lip avoids the back end from rubbing against your window. 
Q: What material is ArmRestor using?
A: The ArmRestor is made of automotive friendly plastics with UV stabilizers and is scratch resistant.
Q: Will a drink spill while driving? 
A: No, the design of the bottle holder and unit will withstand road bumps, so it acts as a shock absorber. Your bottle of water will be safe. 
Q: Will the drink come out of the bottle holder if I slam the door? 
A: It is intended for water bottle, so it will be fine. Let's not slam your door, bad for your car!

Many conceptual ideas I have created for eventual introduction in areas of housewares, stationary goods, Aftermarket.... My first success begins with the ArmRestor.

The ArmRestor is a product that aids all drivers and passengers with functionality that today's vehicles lack. This lack of amenities gave rise to my passion to introduce to the market a unique vehicle accessory and arm rest, allowing safety, convenience, and medicinal options.

Supporters are an immense part of the project not only to see the vision come to life through their financial support but through their on-going interest in seeing this through, making it a joint venture.

Risks & Challenges
It took me many years and more than 30 revisions to design and perfect the ArmRestor. I had spent most of our time in the main body design starting with multi-components to the unibody design.

<h2>More about Cherrywood...</h2>
<p><b>Who are our customers?</b> Quilters, Fiber Artists, Garment Makers, Sewers, Seamstresses, Crafters, Doll Makers, Interior Designers, you get the picture…</p>
<p><b>What do we make? </b> We dye solid cotton fabric. That's all we do, and we do it well!  Our special ""suede"" technique has been perfected over our 30 years in business.  </p>
<p><b>What do we mean by “solids?”</b> If you walk into a quilt shop or fabric store, you will see an amazing array of beautiful designs, prints and textures on bolts of fabric. Gorgeous? Yes. Overwhelming? Maybe. At Cherrywood, we have proven that solid colors can be just as powerful as an array of patterns and prints. When you let the COLOR of the fabric do all the heavy lifting, the DESIGN is what rises to the top. The eye is not distracted by printed images in the fabric. But even better is how well Cherrywood plays with other fabrics. It is very welcoming, polite, complementary and makes those prints look good. Everything a good friend should be!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433178283/mo6dixkllgge4nm2w8rt.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>So, big deal - there’s tons of plain colored fabric out there, right?  </p>
<p><b>What makes Cherrywood so special? </b>We start with a high-quality 100% cotton unbleached muslin. Then, we use our secret formulas, procion dyes, and proprietary technique to create a fabric so soft- so organic - so “broken-in” - that you gotta feel it to believe it!  The dyeing process, including two hot water rinse cycles, results in an extremely high thread count. (This is important, for those keeping track.) The gentle 'mottling' creates a tone-on-tone texture that gives these solid fabrics an amazing depth and richness. <b> It actually looks like suede! </b> Even non-quilters feel the need to touch it.</p>
<p>That's the official answer to ""Oh my gosh, how do you get this to feel so fabulous?""  But it just may also have something to do with the fact that our team of experts has touched it countless times before it comes to you.</p>

What is Cherrywood?


We are a small hand-dyed fabric business in Brainerd, Minnesota, that has a BIG following in the quilting world.  Our claim to fame is our luscious ""suede look"", our amazing solid colors bundled together in gradations, and our high quality. 
(If you want to know more about us, keep scrolling through to the end!)

What do we need?
We desperately need a new building.  Cherrywood Hand Dyed Fabric is taking a long overdue step. We are trying to move forward, but have reached capacity in our current building. UPDATE: We have found a building!

It is in great condition and will need very little remodel! A bank loan has been secured for the purchase of the building.  We are also using personal finances and waiting to hear if we will receive a grant from the Initiative Foundation. **To celebrate, we have added new perks below - check it out! There are some gorgeous quilts, table runners and placemats up for grabs!**Your donations will be used for the remodeling costs. The list includes:installing customized streamline plumbing to accommodate many washing machines, with potential to double the number of machines.wall construction to separate three work areas: messy (dyeing), somewhat messy (processing), and clean (office and design)ventilation and fans to control dust particles and lint to keep our lungs healthypurchasing new equipment such as washing machines, dryers, and cutting tablesWe hope to begin construction mid August, and move in the new space this fall before our heavy travel season begins.  Your donation towards the build-out will help us move faster and make this a reality!
What happens if we surpass our goal?  Well, we have identified two stretch goals for ourselves that will increase our efficiency even more:

purchase another mangle for $2000
hire a general manager so that Karla can focus on the creative side of the business

Why do we need it?

Our working conditions are working against us. 
The current location of Cherrywood was meant to be temporary. Thanks to our devoted fans, we have flourished and ended up staying longer than planned. 
However, the old, multi-level building has many obstacles:
Dyeing process takes place in a small basement • Extreme high humidity that affects the dyes and sometimes causes us to shut down production • Lack of air conditioning • Old pipes  crumbling from tree roots • Continual floor drain back up •   Lack of proper space in dye ""room"" causing us to stack buckets of dye making them hard to access •  Absolutely no space to expand production •  Lack of storage for all materials under one roof • Lack of loading dock • Lack of personal work spaces •  Inefficient work flow • Two flights of stairs forcing us to haul fabric rolls,  10 lb. dye buckets, 5 gallon Synthrapol buckets, 50 pound bags of soda ash,  wet bins of fabric, and finished inventory by hand… 
Our employees' needs are pretty basic: safe, efficient working conditions… rolling carts instead of aching muscles. 
How can we stop working against our environment and make it work for us? With the purchase of a new building! 
YOU can help us get to the NEXT LEVEL---
ONE LEVEL!
We have plans for a building that will allow us to be more efficient in so many ways:  
- We will be able to handle our production with MUCH more efficiency and even increase to meet our growing demand. 
- A better workflow means handling the product fewer times, increasing efficiency.  We can move materials with rolling carts instead of our backs. This will allow us to keep our labor-intense product at an affordable price.
- With increased efficiency, Karla hopes to find more time for designing new patterns, formulating new gradations and developing new projects like the hugely successful ""WICKED Challenge"". 
- Dorothy will be able to nurture and grow our wholesale division, which gets Cherrywood closer to YOU through your local quilt shop. We have not been able to take on many wholesale orders because of our physical limitations. 
- Our shipping department can be just that - an actual department separated from the general work areas. This delivers Cherrywood to YOU faster! 
- We would love to accommodate tours and groups that we have had to turn away in the past. We are also dreaming about a sewing and education space to teach customers how to cut into their beloved stash!

What do we make?  We dye solid cotton fabric. That's all we do, and we do it well!  Our special ""suede"" technique has been perfected over our 30 years in business.  
What do we mean by “solids?” If you walk into a quilt shop or fabric store, you will see an amazing array of beautiful designs, prints and textures on bolts of fabric. Gorgeous? Yes. Overwhelming? Maybe. At Cherrywood, we have proven that solid colors can be just as powerful as an array of patterns and prints. When you let the COLOR of the fabric do all the heavy lifting, the DESIGN is what rises to the top. The eye is not distracted by printed images in the fabric. But even better is how well Cherrywood plays with other fabrics. It is very welcoming, polite, complementary and makes those prints look good. Everything a good friend should be!

So, big deal - there’s tons of plain colored fabric out there, right?  
What makes Cherrywood so special? We start with a high-quality 100% cotton unbleached muslin. Then, we use our secret formulas, procion dyes, and proprietary technique to create a fabric so soft- so organic - so “broken-in” - that you gotta feel it to believe it!  The dyeing process, including two hot water rinse cycles, results in an extremely high thread count. (This is important, for those keeping track.) The gentle 'mottling' creates a tone-on-tone texture that gives these solid fabrics an amazing depth and richness.  It actually looks like suede!  Even non-quilters feel the need to touch it.
That's the official answer to ""Oh my gosh, how do you get this to feel so fabulous?""  But it just may also have something to do with the fact that our team of experts has touched it countless times before it comes to you.
Who is Cherrywood?  
Cherrywood is: Karla Overland, owner of Cherrywood. I am a Designer and am addicted to designing everything - color gradations, fabrics, quilts, patterns, websites, and graphics. 

Cherrywood is: Dorothy Cronin, my right-hand woman. She is passionate about what she does and puts her nose to the grindstone until a job is complete. She coordinates all our trade shows and handles the wholesale accounts.

Cherrywood is: Melissa Yeager, our newest addition. She gets your mail orders sent to you in the blink of an eye and is the contact person for our WICKED Challenge logistics.

Cherrywood is: Arlo Hill, Darla Grotzke and Lorrene Maroney - the “Cherrywood Manglers,” a.k.a. Pressing and Packaging Engineers, a.k.a. the women who take piles and piles of wet fabric and magically turn it into those perfectly folded bundles you can't resist.

Cherrywood is: “showgirls!” It’s not what you think, but it is still a pretty kickin' job. We need extra helpers at the 10 national quilt shows we go to, and this gives me an opportunity to bring along trusted friends, colleagues and even my sisters Brenda and Stacy. 
Cherrywood is also YOU - our customers, our supporters, our cheerleaders, our creative muses, our family, our friends. Many of you have been Cherrywood fans since the beginning 30 years ago and have watched us evolve. 
Your feedback is crucial to us. 
Your ideas are inspiring to us. 
Your compliments are humbling to us.
And now, your donations make you part of us. 



THANK YOU! THANK YOU!

<p><b>We're all just chronically sore all of the time. Sometimes we can barely speak.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Laryngopharyngeal Reflux (LPR) is a chronic, life changing disease that involves damaging contents from the stomach whooshing upwards past the oesophagus to damage the voicebox, mouth and nose. There is no evidence based cure and symptomatic treatment is often unsuccessful. It is not a lifestyle disease and it affects all people, even those who are perilously thin. LPR is thought to be a risk factor for the development of laryngeal cancer.</p>
<p>We are seeking funding to set up a support site for this condition and to campaign for improved recognition and treatment of this difficult disease.</p>
<p>Our key aims are as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">To provide evidence based information about LPR and Extra-Oesophageal (EOR) disease. Where conflicting theories exist, to provide details of both.</span><br/>

<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">To provide information about investigations, therapies and procedures that may be of benefit, giving the reader an immediate sense of the strength of the supporting evidence for each</span><br/>

<li>Miscellaneous administration costs (e.g. stock photos for the site, domain name registration etc)</li> <li>We expect to be able to have a web presence even if the funding falls short. However, the greater the funds, the more impact we can have.</li>
<li>We believe transparency is the key here and ALL financial transactions will be posted on the website, so that everyone can see where each and every cent has been spent.</li> </ul>
<br/>Please note that the site requires independent funding sources as we will not accept any contributions from the healthcare industry or in fact any commercial source. We will also not be displaying advertising. This is vital if the site is to provide objective guidance. <br/><br/><div><b>How can you help?</b></div>

Laryngopharyngeal Reflux (LPR) is a chronic, life changing disease that involves damaging contents from the stomach whooshing upwards past the oesophagus to damage the voicebox, mouth and nose. There is no evidence based cure and symptomatic treatment is often unsuccessful. It is not a lifestyle disease and it affects all people, even those who are perilously thin. LPR is thought to be a risk factor for the development of laryngeal cancer.
We are seeking funding to set up a support site for this condition and to campaign for improved recognition and treatment of this difficult disease.
Our key aims are as follows:



To provide evidence based information about LPR and Extra-Oesophageal (EOR) disease. Where conflicting theories exist, to provide details of both.


To provide information about investigations, therapies and procedures that may be of benefit, giving the reader an immediate sense of the strength of the supporting evidence for each


To act as an internet focal point for LPR / EOR sufferers


To campaign for improved recognition and treatment of LPR/EOR


To achieve funding for long-term goals



In the longer term, we hope to be in a position to achieve charitable status and support distinct research on LPR/EOR.

Why do we need cash?

We are seeking to raise £2000 in our initial efforts to raise the profile of this disease. This will support
  
Server and IT Costs £10-20 per month (3 years funding = £720). A domain name has already been secured.
 Costs to access academic journals and articles relating to LPR. Unfortunately, information is not free these days.
Miscellaneous administration costs (e.g. stock photos for the site, domain name registration etc) We expect to be able to have a web presence even if the funding falls short. However, the greater the funds, the more impact we can have.
We believe transparency is the key here and ALL financial transactions will be posted on the website, so that everyone can see where each and every cent has been spent. 
Please note that the site requires independent funding sources as we will not accept any contributions from the healthcare industry or in fact any commercial source. We will also not be displaying advertising. This is vital if the site is to provide objective guidance. How can you help?
We don't necessarily want big investors, just a few dollars or pounds here and there from anyone who is interested in battling this disease. We have heard countless stories of how people's lives have been changed through this annoying, horrible, irritating, unsettling, worrying,  ****** awful disease. Yes, the ***** is necessary for this disease.We know what it's like because we're going through it too. Right now.

We know lots of people are battling many serious conditions and many of those are more devastating than LPR. We don't want sympathy. We just want what everybody else with a chronic disease wants, the hope that one day it will be gone.
We're not saying this funding will change the situation  overnight. But isn't about time we started to change? Let's Play Rough and be rid of LPR.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

THE ISSUES 
The world is in crisis. Cities are facing particularly big challenges as the climate changes and natural resources become scarcer. Industrialization and continued globalization threaten to wipe out the basic knowledge that has kept humankind in harmony with the planet for centuries. 

OUR SOLUTIONS

Rather than focus on developing technology, which disconnects us further from life, we want connect with the land and Nature, remind ourselves of our responsibility to Earth, of our love and care for this planet.

We are inspired by our own experiences of living in nature. We realize, after years away from cities, the importance of sharing this lost knowledge of living off the land, especially for children. 


Earth will soon be in the hands of the next generation. We want to provide them with the keys to access and maintain harmony between all living forms. We must begin to practice a cleaner, healthier and balanced lifestyle to secure our children a safe and rich future.

<p>1. The Healing Center needs to finish the Salt Water Solar Heated Pool, Outdoor Spa Bathrooms and Outdoor Kitchen and Dining Space  </p>
<p>2. The Yin Yang Yurt Village needs to complete the Yurts, create a source of electricity, create outdoor spa bathrooms, create catfish and tilapia pond and plant fruit orchard  </p>
<p>3. Our Aquaponic Farm and Edible Food Forest needs to finish the 20x60ft greenhouse, create aquaponic system, plant spiral herb garden, put up strawberry and lilikoi trellises and plant an edible food forest in our 7-acre Volcanic paradise </p>
<p>4. Our Ceremonial Space needs to finish our tipis,  finish the Bamboo Star Temple, create Ifugao Hut created by Ifugao Shaman and Sculptor Mamerto ""Lagitan"" Tindongan and mediation huts and paths through the Rainforest. </p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Our way of saying MAHALO ~ SALAMAT ~ ARIGATO and THANK YOU in all other languages of the heart is to give you gifts of prayers, healing, opportunities of deep spiritual transformation and inspiration.

saving the world may be her end goal, we need to start a little
smaller…increasing the number of people and ways that we can serve clients
through No Knots Professional Massage &amp; Bodywork, Inc. </p>
<p>That is the reason that we have decided that we are going to
run a Crowd-funding campaign to help us raise the capital needed to expand our
business. We understand that a certain percentage of people will think that
using Crowd-funding is a tacky way to help us expand, and to those people, we
are sorry that you feel that way.  As a
small business that does not sell a lot of retail (yet) and relies on our
massage therapists’ time (and ability to continue working) to make money, it is
hard to expand. Unfortunately, it is not as easy to get a loan for expansion
when your business relies solely on the time of a few people. However, that
just means that we have to get creative! 
</p>
<p>Watch our video to hear more about what this expansion means to our owner, Jennifer.  In the meantime, let us tell you a bit about ourselves, as well as our
expansion goal, so that you can see where we are coming from and how we are
going to move forward when we have the funds.</p>
<p>At the age of 19, Jennifer started No Knots Professional
Massage &amp; Bodywork by providing in-home massage services to clients 6 days per week.  Shortly after she started she was approached
by an amazing woman who was the
sole caregiver for her adult daughter who was disabled from Multiple
Sclerosis. Jennifer quickly found that <b>connecting with
people and providing them with safe, loving touch, not only gave benefit to clients
but filled her heart as well</b>.  Jennifer
has continued to serve her clients with a full heart since the very beginning but realizes that she has
so much more to give.  </p>
<p>In 2011, Jennifer’s schedule had gotten so busy that she had
to expand to a physical location in order to eliminate some of the travel time that was causing her to miss out on time to serve more of her clients. She opened the 675 square foot massage
clinic that currently houses No Knots Professional Massage &amp; Bodywork,
Inc.  After a few years in this location, Jennifer started
to run out of room in her schedule again. 
She started the search for a second massage therapist, to no avail.
Instead, she found a phenomenal assistant that soon became the newest member of
the No Knots team.  Nicole was not only a
great assistant, she was in the process of getting her Reiki Energy Work
certification.  She soon became the Reiki
Master at the office, as well as Jennifer’s assistant. </p>
<p></p>After Nicole started in the office, Jennifer realized a new goal…helping
new health practitioners find their place in the market and healing themselves in
a positive work environment as they helped to heal others.  The more high quality health practitioners
that the general public has access to, the more people we can help. That means
<b>less pain, less stress and more healthy people</b> living and working in our
communities!  Jennifer’s new expansion
dream started to grow from there.  
</div><div>
<p>This month another practitioner started to work out of the No Knots space. She is one more person that can make a difference in the lives and
health of others.  Jennifer has a vision
to house several more health practitioners in the new space adjacent to our
current space.  With the extra space in this expansion our team will have the opportunity to grow and to change thousands of lives. </p>
<p>When we raise the funds to complete this expansion, our
clients will not only have access to the practitioners that are currently in
the office but will have easy access to additional alternative therapies to
help them deal with stress, pain, emotional trauma and a wide variety of other
health issues. In conjunction with more
treatment modalities, we plan to offer a variety of seminars to help educate our clients on many avenues of health and wellness.  As you already read
above, it is our passion to serve people.  With our current practitioner team in place, we are now starting to form our team of supporters. <br/></p>

choices for the business, we are constantly re-assessing where we are 
with this expansion plan as well as the funding for the expansion.  
After a review of our timeline for the expansion, we have decided to 
scale back the original plan and move forward more slowly than anticipated. This will help us to
 focus on one section of the expansion at a time and ensure the 
continued success of each portion of the business. If there is one thing
 that we have learned over the years, it is that growth is a process of 
ever changing strategy and decisions must be made and re-assessed 
often.</b> </i><br/></p><p>Our overall expansion plan is to add an additional 2,700 square feet to
our current 675 square foot- two treatment room location (in red box below.)  This will include
up to 5 more treatment rooms, a retail space, a bathroom, a small seminar
space, a large seminar space, room for storage and a laundry room.  This space would allow us to help educate our
clients and others in the community, offer more services to our clients and
give us the space to expand our retail store to bring clients the products that
they have been asking for. <br/></p><p>At this time, we will be moving forward on a portion of that space.  The image below shows the expansion plan in its entirety, however, we will be starting with expanding into the space on the top half of the plan.  This will give us two additional treatment rooms, a large area for a gift shop/product store and two large closets for storage.  We will continue to use the common area (a large open space within our building) for seminars until we expand further. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440511213/ouciqdnqejxqncyycaqq.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 622.58px; height: 481px;""/></p>
<p><strong>With the changes to our expansion pace, our monetary goal for this campaign is also changing.  The new goal will be $20,000.</strong>  Here is what the $20,000 will

</div><p>
</p><p>For the past 14 years, our goal is to <strong><em><em>help change the lives
of thousands of people</em></em></strong> for the better by giving them access to compassionate
health practitioners that are educated on the human body and how it works and
use this knowledge to teach our clients one on one how to care for their body.  We can
make a larger impact by adding health and wellness seminars/classes to teach in
a larger setting as well as more practitioners that can help them heal.  Many of our current clients come to us with
pain, stress, anxiety and fear about the health decisions that they are
making.  Our practitioners utilize their
knowledge to help clear their mind, release their stress and assist their body
back in to balance so that it can heal itself. 
We want to be able to do this for more people.  Our practitioners are professionals that are
passionate about helping people and love to do this “job”.  We want to help these clients thrive in the
lives.  </p>
<p>As you may have read earlier, our owner (Jennifer), has a
passion for volunteer service and is very active in her community.  As part of the expansion, Jennifer has
<b>committed to donating</b> the use of the seminar space (for a select number of
events per month) to non-profits that fit in with the No Knots Professional Massage
&amp; Bodywork, Inc. mission.  These
non-profits will be selected based on an application that shows the activities that are done in the local
community to raise awareness about health and wellness topics, the number of
people served, their commitment to their own mission as well as the
availability of the space for their selected events.  </p>

practitioners that we have working in the office as independent contractors. We
want to give other practitioners a safe and healing environment to grow and
expand their business while teaming up with like-minded individuals to help our
clients and the community members.  The
challenge is finding practitioners that work well together, have similar goals
and are strong enough in their own business to rent space at our clinic.  We are confident that we can do this because
our current practitioners all have connections in the communities surrounding
our office and are all involved with business networking groups that bolster
relationships with like-minded individuals. 
With the contacts that we make through other organizations, we often
find practitioners that are a good fit for our team. </p><div>
</div><p>Our second challenge is getting the word out to our client

social media, email newsletters, word of mouth marketing and local newspaper
advertising options to draw more individuals and families in to our seminars
and classes.  We will be polling our
current client base on what content that they would like to see offered.  Per our original clinic design, we also have
the advantage of being a storefront location. 
Signage will be prominently displayed on our building so that new
customers/clients and community members can clearly see what we offer.  </p><div>
</div><p>Our main risk on this adventure is committing to a lease
without having a full time practitioner base to start with and a full schedule

that we will succeed due to our strong network of supporters, clients,
colleagues, friends and families.  We are
currently working on a list of classes/seminars and will be posting them as soon
as we have final commitment from our instructors. We are continually looking
for practitioners that can work with us to accomplish the goals that we have
set and that have goals that we can help them accomplish. </p><div>

<p>We know that some of our biggest supporters will be
individuals that don’t have the funds to contribute to our campaign.  That is okay! 
We still love you for showing your support!  </p>
<p>If you cannot contribute financially, we ask that you
contribute your time.  <strong>Take some time to

to change the lives of thousands for the better!</p>
<p>There is one more way that you can support us.  When we opened our current location, we knew
that it was important for us to fill our space from the inside-out with
positive blessings and kind words.  We
asked our family, friends and acquaintances to fill out blessing cards for us
to hang inside the walls of our space. These
blessings offered support, “May the practitioners working in this space have the
strength and knowledge to help each person they touch” or words of intention, “Let
each person who steps foot in this room be filled with love, light and positive
energy” or a blessing for healing “May all that enter this space be blessed
with good health and healing.”  We had a
lot of people participate and had blessing cards from each one to hang. Before
the sheetrock went up in the space, we hung all of the cards and set the
intention of filling our space with love, compassion and positive healing
energy. We believe that it has worked, so
we would love to do this in our expanded space as well.  <br/></p><p>If you would like to <b>create a blessing card

No Knots Professional Massage & Bodywork, Inc. has, for

and wellness goals. For those of you that know our owner, Jennifer, you know
that her heart is always focused on her clients and how she can serve one more
person and eventually save the world. (Insert laughter here) While
saving the world may be her end goal, we need to start a little
smaller…increasing the number of people and ways that we can serve clients
through No Knots Professional Massage & Bodywork, Inc. 
That is the reason that we have decided that we are going to
run a Crowd-funding campaign to help us raise the capital needed to expand our
business. We understand that a certain percentage of people will think that

<p>We are two girls (Camille, 28 and Dominique, 32) originally from Manila with the biggest dreams in the
world. Camille is a traveling journalist, while Dominique works as a marketing specialist and a hostel manager. Since we have the innate yearning for the sea, traveling, and pursuing our dreams, we did not pass off an opportunity when one of us saw a lot in General Luna, Siargao with a hut in it. And we thought, “this is our
home. We will grow old here.”</p>
<p>As we write this, materials for construction have been
bought and repairs are being done in the house. The original hut used to be a shop, and we
want to make it as cozy as possible so that it can become a comfortable nesting
place for like-minded and free-spirited individuals. It is now being built into
a two-storey house with an attic. The house is too big for the two of us and we
are planning to transform the remaining space into a homestay or an AirBnb-rented inn with 5
hammocks, some beds, and a space to pitch tents for budget travelers and surfers visiting this beautiful little
island. There will also be a ""hangout"" area with trippy lights, mats, pillows, bean bags to serve as the common area where we can all chill. We are two women starting small, and we are noticing that the repairs
are becoming quite costly. </p>

dreams coming true.All of us have this wish that someday, we will live
somewhere in a place we’ve always dreamed of. Away from the bustling city and

everyone, but for the two of us, we found it in Siargao Island.
We are two girls (Camille, 28 and Dominique, 32) originally from Manila with the biggest dreams in the

hammocks, some beds, and a space to pitch tents for budget travelers and surfers visiting this beautiful little

are becoming quite costly.

<h3><b>Who We Are</b></h3>
<p>My name is Christine and I founded Mo'Pweeze Bakery as a way to provide safe treats for my son and other kids to enjoy. As an allergy sufferer and head of a household of allergy sufferers including three kids, my youngest son suffers from 35 different allergies and was the inspiration for developing desserts that are Top '8' allergen free.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>The eight foods identified by the FDA are:</em></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Milk</strong></li>
<li><strong>Eggs</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>Fish</strong> (e.g., bass, flounder, cod)</li>
<li>
<strong>Crustacean shellfish</strong> (e.g. crab, lobster, shrimp)</li>
<li>
<strong>Tree nuts</strong> (e.g., almonds, walnuts, pecans)</li>
<li><strong>Peanuts</strong></li>
<li><strong>Wheat</strong></li>
<li><strong>Soybeans</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">Our mission here at Mo'Pweeze is to take the worries from parents, caregivers and allergy sufferers who are looking for safe, delicious treats. We use the finest, freshest ingredients, free from all common allergens and look to provide a menu that is filled with safe, scrumptious foods.</span></p>
<p>Mo'Pweeze Bakery is an online bakery based <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">in the Northern NJ area. Recently Voted 'Best bakery in Bergen' for 2016 by Bergen magazine, Mo'Pweeze has recently relocated to  a gluten-free, nut-free kitchen in Denville, NJ and has a growing fan base of customers who we reach through our website at </span><a href=""http://www.mopweezebakery.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">www.mopweezebakery.com</a><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> as well as a number of Farmers markets in the Northern NJ area. Mo'Pweeze also attends a number of special events and expos focused on Vegan, Specialty Food, and Allergen markets.</span></p>
<p>And as for our name, it was inspired by our son Maddox words after tasting his first yummy allergy free treat - Mo'Pweeze (More please).</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472591548/20130616_160700_q0qclb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p> <p><b>Why we need Funding</b></p>Just as we began Mo'Pweeze as a way to provide treats to our own son who suffers from multiple allergies, we know that there are many individuals, families and kids who are not able to enjoy foods that most of us take for granted. We live for feedback from our customers describing how we were their or their children's first store bought cupcake or cake EVER.  We seek to create one of NJ's only all Allergen-free and Vegan retail bakeries to give customers a little haven, and where we can be more accessible to customers in need of our products in a family friendly atmosphere. </div><div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476985783/uwp280gn7z0iydqzgt9h.png"" src="""" style=""""/></div><div>
<p>Along with being able to provide a wider variety of baked goods for retail, A space like this would allow us to:</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">·</span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">  </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Provide kids decorating classes.</span><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">.  Provide an allergen-free party room</span><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">·</span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">  </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Partner with local food artisans to showcase new allergy friendly products.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Along with finishing the storefront space, your funding will help us with additional equipment purchasing and fit outs, and to get us stocked up for a grand opening.</span></p>
</div><div>We seek <b>25K</b> through the IndieGogo campaign in order to fit out our storefront.  If we exceed this goal the additional funds will go towards purchasing equipment and stocking up on initial inventory. Alternatively, additional funding will be sought through business loans and equipment financing. </div><div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476985829/iomtdpurvsqg1h4zdh55.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div><div> </div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Your contributions will allow us to bring smiles to more faces of allergy sufferers, celiacs, vegans, and gluten free adherents who have a hard time finding safe and delicious treats</span></div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">.</span></div><div><b>What we Hope to Bring to you</b></div><div>
<p>Mo'Pweeze Bakery sells a wide range of gourmet cupcakes, sweet breads, cookies, and custom cakes. Each item is made from scratch using all natural and verified allergen free sources sourced through largely local suppliers or distributors. It is important that our products not only taste delicious but that they also look appealing and attractive to the eye. </p>
<p>Customers may purchase pre-made or made-to-order products. We also have the ability to customize special orders for our customers in order to eliminate additional allergens without loss of taste. This attention to the health needs of our customers as well as taste profile has gained us much positive good will and positive reviews.</p>
<p>We have only just begun in creating a line of allergen treats. A retail storefront will give everyone an accessible spot to pick up or see the smile on their kids faces when they can choose whatever store treat of their choosing.

</div></div>","Who We Are
My name is Christine and I founded Mo'Pweeze Bakery as a way to provide safe treats for my son and other kids to enjoy. As an allergy sufferer and head of a household of allergy sufferers including three kids, my youngest son suffers from 35 different allergies and was the inspiration for developing desserts that are Top '8' allergen free.
 
The eight foods identified by the FDA are:

Milk
Eggs

Fish (e.g., bass, flounder, cod)

Crustacean shellfish (e.g. crab, lobster, shrimp)

Tree nuts (e.g., almonds, walnuts, pecans)
Peanuts
Wheat
Soybeans

Our mission here at Mo'Pweeze is to take the worries from parents, caregivers and allergy sufferers who are looking for safe, delicious treats. We use the finest, freshest ingredients, free from all common allergens and look to provide a menu that is filled with safe, scrumptious foods.
Mo'Pweeze Bakery is an online bakery based in the Northern NJ area. Recently Voted 'Best bakery in Bergen' for 2016 by Bergen magazine, Mo'Pweeze has recently relocated to  a gluten-free, nut-free kitchen in Denville, NJ and has a growing fan base of customers who we reach through our website at www.mopweezebakery.com as well as a number of Farmers markets in the Northern NJ area. Mo'Pweeze also attends a number of special events and expos focused on Vegan, Specialty Food, and Allergen markets.
And as for our name, it was inspired by our son Maddox words after tasting his first yummy allergy free treat - Mo'Pweeze (More please).
 
 
 Why we need FundingJust as we began Mo'Pweeze as a way to provide treats to our own son who suffers from multiple allergies, we know that there are many individuals, families and kids who are not able to enjoy foods that most of us take for granted. We live for feedback from our customers describing how we were their or their children's first store bought cupcake or cake EVER.  We seek to create one of NJ's only all Allergen-free and Vegan retail bakeries to give customers a little haven, and where we can be more accessible to customers in need of our products in a family friendly atmosphere. 
Along with being able to provide a wider variety of baked goods for retail, A space like this would allow us to:
·  Provide kids decorating classes..  Provide an allergen-free party room·  Partner with local food artisans to showcase new allergy friendly products.
Along with finishing the storefront space, your funding will help us with additional equipment purchasing and fit outs, and to get us stocked up for a grand opening.
We seek 25K through the IndieGogo campaign in order to fit out our storefront.  If we exceed this goal the additional funds will go towards purchasing equipment and stocking up on initial inventory. Alternatively, additional funding will be sought through business loans and equipment financing.  Your contributions will allow us to bring smiles to more faces of allergy sufferers, celiacs, vegans, and gluten free adherents who have a hard time finding safe and delicious treats.What we Hope to Bring to you
Mo'Pweeze Bakery sells a wide range of gourmet cupcakes, sweet breads, cookies, and custom cakes. Each item is made from scratch using all natural and verified allergen free sources sourced through largely local suppliers or distributors. It is important that our products not only taste delicious but that they also look appealing and attractive to the eye. 
Customers may purchase pre-made or made-to-order products. We also have the ability to customize special orders for our customers in order to eliminate additional allergens without loss of taste. This attention to the health needs of our customers as well as taste profile has gained us much positive good will and positive reviews.
We have only just begun in creating a line of allergen treats. A retail storefront will give everyone an accessible spot to pick up or see the smile on their kids faces when they can choose whatever store treat of their choosing. A storefront will also allow us to expand our line to include additional goods such as donuts, sandwich breads, brownies, as well as accessory items that would provide for a more thorough cafe experience such as specialty teas, and coffees using non dairy milks and creamers. 
 
 The Impact
With your help we hope to bring safe and delicious foods to kids and families in NY/NJ.

</p><p><b><u>Our business:</u></b></p>
<p>Hello, my name is Etienne Desnoyers and I am the owner of the Dumoine
Valley Guides lodge<span>  and I am here today
seeking help in expanding my small business. 
The Dumoine Valley Guides is what we call an outfitter; we provide
lodging, meals, cottages, equipment and guiding services for people that wish
to enjoy nature in our region.  We can
help you with just about anything you want to do in our great wilderness.  Where are we located?  Our lodge is located on the island of Rapides
des Joachims, in the province of Québec, Canada.  We are easily accessible as we less than 10
minutes from the Trans Canadian highway (2 hours from the city of Ottawa). 
I live on location with my wife Kieran and my young baby boy,  Seth.  </span></p>
<p>This business was founded by my parents back in 1982 and has been
operated by my father since.<span>  Sadly in
2012 my father passed away and left the lodge to my sister and I.  I have since decided to take over the
business; I left my job as an aircraft maintenance technician to work here full
time in the village where I grew up. After three years I do not see myself do
anything else now and I will continue to be here and take care of what my
father has left me.  It’s a therapeutic place
for me and helps me in my grief.  As for
my sister she is a member of the Canadian forces and has for now established a life in
Nova Scotia. </span></p>
<p>I am launching this campaign in the hopes that I can raise enough money
to help develop my business.<span>  Our lodge
and cottages are constructed on an 8 acres property on the shores of the Ottawa
River. This property has potential to become a fantastic place for people to
vacation with their family and friends, our problem is that this property is
cut in half by a steep hill and a dense forest that greatly limit access to the
waterfront.</span></p>
<p><b><u>The project:</u></b></p>
<p>This money will be used for a few different things. Firstly, hire
landscapers to excavate the hill in order to build a small road down to the
river, the estimated price of this phase is $15 000.<span>  The second stage will be to purchase and
install a quality eco-friendly plastic dock system in our bay; this will allow
our customer to take full advantage of the water access with rental fishing
boats that people can take when they want, the cost of this dock system is $6
500. The last major step will be to make some space at the bottom of the hill
(removal of some of the trees) to give space for people to play, camp or
whatever they feel like doing. Hiring a professional logger and his equipment
will account for the remaining $3 500. </span></p>
<p>Once a proper access is made we can then start developing, with nice
areas for people to relax and play.<span>  Our
goal is not to pack our property with customer like sardines but to give people
some room to move, creating a space that people can be themselves with their
family and friends at an affordable price.</span></p>
<p>Why not get a bank loan?<span>  This is
a simple and obvious question, as a touristic business we do have a down season
(fall and spring) where we do not see much in the way of customers and
therefore income.  A bank loan can
greatly reduce our chance of survival as payments have to be made even when you
might not be able to afford it.  As the
economy gets hard for some of us, vacations are the first thing people might
sacrifice.  It can be a tough situation
for business like me as debt is the number 1 killer for business like ours. </span></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p><b><u>Our strategy:</u></b></p>
<p>Our strategy is a simple one: allow people to invest in our business giving
them discounts worth many times their initial investment.<span>  This will serve two goals; finance our
projects without getting into heavy loans and create a customer base that will
have a big incentive to return multiple times.</span></p>
<p>If we do not meet our goal we will finance other smaller projects that
will need to be accomplished (updating our fishing boat fleet, renovations,
etc.).<span>  In the event that we are close to
our goal, we will then try to find other source of funding (banks, government
loans) to cover the difference.  On the
other hand if we exceed this hefty goal we will perform the landscaping and the
construction of the dock and do renovations of our installations and equipment.</span></p>
<p>All promised perks will stay the same (or get better) and be honoured. </p>
<p><b><u>The perks:</u></b><span>  </span></p>
<p>The first perk is for the people that donate $10; we understand that
some people might live too far to have a chance to visit us so this one is
simply if you feel like giving us a hand.<span> 
So a nice shout out on our Facebook page will let everyone know that
you’re pretty cool.</span></p>
<p>Second perk, $20 dollars will get the mentioned above FB shout out plus
a nice homemade postal card with pictures of the local wildlife we have taken with our camera.<br/></p>
<p>$50 is where things get interesting; this one will get you all of the
above plus a 15% discount for all of our services.<span>  So imagine you are looking at renting a
cottage, maybe do some fishing, or some canoeing this coupon can potentially
save you hundreds of dollars when you pay us a visit.</span></p>
<p>$150, you get a 10% life time discount
card.<span>  We will send you a nice plastic
card that will allow you to get a 10% discount every time you visit us for
life. </span></p>
<p>$200 gets you a
15% life time discount card when you visit us and enjoy what you helped us
build. </p>
<p>Now for the big one; $500 gets you the Facebook thanks, the post card
and a 25% lifetime discount (plastic card). This one is for the people that
really love spending some time in nature.<span> 
With all of the great stuff to do on our beautiful island you will
always have a place to stay at the most discounted price, with a potential to
save you thousands of dollar for your entire lifetime. </span></p>
<p><b><u>The challenge:</u></b></p>
<p>This project has a few challenges.<span> 
We make a living by bringing people close to nature.  Without nature I don’t have much to offer my
customers, this is why we have to be very careful with what we do with our environment.  We can’t just put an excavator on the
property and tear it up; we have strict regulations to follow when it comes to
tree removals and the type of plants we introduce. Soil retention is also very important, our
cottages are on top of a very steep hill and if we do not approach the
landscaping of that hill with care we could end up with the cottages at the
bottom of the hill.  Local plant species
will be used to preserve the soil.</span></p>
<p>We will not remove any trees near the shore to prevent erosion and
follow local regulations.</p>
<p>I do know that this campaign is mostly directed to people that live
within a certain distance from us as it might be hard for people from around
the world to pay us a visit and take advantage of the bigger perks, the target
audience can be quite small making this goal difficult to reach but with enough
people sharing this campaign I guess you really don’t know what could happen.</p>
<p>Please check our website and see what we have to currently offer and do
not hesitate to give us a call of send us an email if you have any questions
about our business and this campaign.  Sharing this campaign is another way to help us in a big way. <br/></p>

</div></div>","Save the Mansion!@SyracuseHistory on Instagram is partnering with the George & Rebecca Barnes Foundation at 930 James Street in Syracuse, NY to help fund the foundations mission to preserve the Barnes-Hiscock Mansion.  George and Rebecca Barnes built this home in 1853.  Their home was a center of civic-minded activity in our community.  In honor of their leadership and commitment to the people of Central New York, the Foundation has been established in their names.George and Rebecca Barnes were dedicated abolitionists and often placed themselves in danger to help a slave flee to safety.  The mansion played a key role in the abolitionist movement in Syracuse, and has been recongized as one of the stops along the Underground Railroad, Freedom Trail.  George and Rebecca held many meetings in the house and oral history supports that they hid slaves during their long journey north, often having them hide in the basement and carriage house until safe passage could be found.
_____________________________________________________________________________

A building of this size and of this age needs significant upkeep and last December, New York State granted the foundation a $300,000 grant from the state's Regional Economic Development Council initiative.  

The money will be used to completely restore the roof system and decorative elements of the Barnes Hiscock Mansion to allow for further interior and exterior restoration.
But first, the foundation must raise $100,000 in the next year and a half, in order to receive the grant.  This is where you come in!  The George and Rebecca Barnes Foundation along with the support of the Syracuse community must prove their commitment to preserving the historical home.  A donation of any kind, even time, can help.  So Syracuse, will you help save the mansion?
_____________________________________________________________________________
The Board of Directors at the Foundation has tirelessly shown their dedication to this home.  Even more, in August 2014, they demonstrated their continued commitment when they hired their first ever Executive Director, Kristin Earle, to help spearhead efforts to preserve the mansion, with hopes of one day opening it to the public as a museum.  Linked below is just some of their recent work that has received media attention.  We hope that you too will help #savethemansion with a donation today.

</p><p><b>WHO WE ARE</b></p><p>The idea of Nii Juinti came from shaman Roger Daniel Lopez Ramos with the purpose of serving and helping his community and people. It was born when the right team of people came together to help him realize his vision by creating a school.</p>

region, Perú.</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The
mission of the school “Nii Juinti” is to pass on the Shipibo ancestral culture

knowledge.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>OUR GOAL</b></p>
<p>The
objective of the school “Nii Juinti” is to provide a space for 20 Shipibo
children to acquire the ancestral knowledge of the plants, with a focus on the
conservation and use of medicinal plants. Nii Juinti will thus provide the
cognitive and practical tools to train the future <i>curanderos </i>or shamans.</p>
<p>The activities of Nii Juinti are directed
towards children with scarce resources, whose families are not able to fulfil
their primary needs. Nii Juinti will provide housing, nourishment, clothing and
education. In this way, children who live in difficult conditions and with very
few possibilities to develop their potential, will have the opportunity to live
in a protected environment in proximity to their families and to follow a path
of personal and community growth.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>SOME BACKGROUND INFO</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Shipibo people are an ancient
indigenous people from the Amazon rainforest whose lands are located on the
banks of the river Ucayali, in today's Peru. Their physical existence and
culture is based on their harmonious interaction with nature. From the
construction of houses, to the conservation of wildlife and biodiversity, the craft of embroidery and the healing properties of medicinal plants - their
culture has flourished thanks to the traditional knowledge passed on from
generation to generation. </p>
<p>The Nii Juinti initiative arises from the
need to give more relevance to the rural context in which the descendants of
the Shipibo people have their roots. Every year, and with increasing frequency,
many young people choose to leave their traditions behind and migrate towards
bigger cities such as the capital Lima, thereby endangering the precious traditions, knowledge and
wisdom of their Shipibo culture. This phenomenon of loss and migration feeds the process of
urbanization and undermines the formation of “grassroots” development. </p><p></p><p>The conservation of the cultural heritage of the Shipibo people is important not only to their identity, but also to the world at large. More and more people around the Western world are interested in alternative healing methods and in undertaking a path of inner healing through the use of the so-called “master plants”. Nii Juinti will thus also provide a bridge to connect Shipibo culture, including the use of medicinal plants, with the broader Western world. Nii Juinti will serve to enhance human consciousness regarding spiritual balance and environmental stewardship by preserving and deepening Shipibo culture.</p><p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></b></p><p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">THE

SOME BACKGROUND INFO

The Shipibo people are an ancient
indigenous people from the Amazon rainforest whose lands are located on the

culture is based on their harmonious interaction with nature. From the
construction of houses, to the conservation of wildlife and biodiversity, the craft of embroidery and the healing properties of medicinal plants - their
culture has flourished thanks to the traditional knowledge passed on from
generation to generation. 
The Nii Juinti initiative arises from the
need to give more relevance to the rural context in which the descendants of
the Shipibo people have their roots. Every year, and with increasing frequency,
many young people choose to leave their traditions behind and migrate towards
bigger cities such as the capital Lima, thereby endangering the precious traditions, knowledge and
wisdom of their Shipibo culture. This phenomenon of loss and migration feeds the process of
urbanization and undermines the formation of “grassroots” development. The conservation of the cultural heritage of the Shipibo people is important not only to their identity, but also to the world at large. More and more people around the Western world are interested in alternative healing methods and in undertaking a path of inner healing through the use of the so-called “master plants”. Nii Juinti will thus also provide a bridge to connect Shipibo culture, including the use of medicinal plants, with the broader Western world.

We want to work with artists to create a compilation coffee table style art and scrap book that tells the story of Aurora Rise and the people we have been working with, while compiling amazing </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">superhero art work. We will use the funds raised from selling the book and excess funding to expand our own programming to include memorial scholarships and more.</span></span></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3> <p>Aurora Rise is looking to raise $10,000 in order to compile, publish, and print a hardcover coffee table art book. Aurora Rise will sell the art book in order to raise funds to continue providing direct support to those people affected by the Aurora theater shooting who still need it and to help start our memorial scholarship program. For this fundraiser, we have set up some special perks for donors and checkpoints of what we will do with any funds raised in excess to our fundraising goal.</p> <ul> <li>Funding Checkpoints:<br/><p><span>$10,000 - Print Hardcover Sketch Book<br/>-At $10,000 we will be able to compile and publish a full length color coffee table art book that will tell the story of Aurora Rise and some of the people we have worked with. The book will be a compilation of stories, a scrapbook of our early photos from events, and the majority of the book will be dedicated to superhero artwork donated to Aurora Rise. The funds raised from selling the book will go to help start the first Aurora Rise memorial scholarship and help the victims of the Aurora theater shooting.</span></p>
<p>$15,000 - Commission Sketches for Book<br/>-At $15,000 we will be able to compile and publish the full length coffee table book and have funds to commission a few really big name comic artists. While most of the Aurora Rise sketches are donated, the extra funding would allow us to work with some professional artists to do a quality piece instead of a rushed free sketch.</p>
<p>$35,000 - Purchase a handicap van for Aurora Rise<br/>-Aurora Rise works directly with some victims who were disabled in the theater shooting. We try to bring these people out for events, such as Comic Con. However, we have no reliable way of transporting them and using accessible cab services hasn't always worked. We would use the extra funding to purchase a handicap accessible van to provide a stable source of transportation for the people we help who need it most.</p>
<p>$45,000 - Establish 2nd Memorial Scholarship<br/>-One of our main missions is to ensure that those people we lost in the theater will never be forgotten. Aurora Rise will establish our first memorial scholarship this year. If we can raise this much money, it will allow Aurora Rise to establish a second memorial scholarship and ensure that we can continue that scholarship for at least five years.</p>
<p>$50,000 - Bring Artists/Writers to Annual Auction<br/>-If we raise up to the $50,000 dollar mark, we would like to use some of it to help bring out some of the bigger writers and artists who have worked with us to our annual auction. Having artists and writers doing signings at our auctions in the past has help vastly improve the turnout and ensure more money is raised at the auction overall.</p>
<p>$60,000 - Establish 3rd Memorial Scholarship<br/>-One of our main missions is to ensure that those people we lost in the theater will never be forgotten. Aurora Rise will establish our first memorial scholarship this year. If we can raise this much money, it will allow Aurora Rise to establish a third memorial scholarship and ensure that we can continue that scholarship for at least five years.<br/></p>
<p>$75,000 - Establish Aurora Rise Community Memorial<br/>- This is one of our most ambitious checkpoints. If we can raise the extra funding, Aurora Rise would like to establish a permanent community memorial honoring the people we lost in the theater. However, Aurora Rise would like to commission an artist to sculpt a superhero themed memorial to be put up somewhere near the theater to show that their are heroes looking after our community and watching over our fallen.</p>
<p>$85,000 - Establish 4th Memorial Scholarship<br/>-One of our main missions is to ensure that those people we lost in the theater will never be forgotten. Aurora Rise will establish our first memorial scholarship this year. If we can raise this much money, it will allow Aurora Rise to establish a fourth memorial scholarship and ensure that we can continue that scholarship for at least five years.<br/></p>
<p>$100,000 - Sustain AR Scholarships for Five Years<br/>-This is the big one! If we can raise $100,000 we will have enough to sustain the Aurora Rise scholarship programs with five memorial scholarships (maybe more) for at least five years. This would allow Aurora Rise to expand our operations and allow us the most capability to help our applicants.</p>

With the trial now going on, many people are finding themselves once again in need of support. We have helped our applicants in many ways. For example, many people took off work or lost their jobs due to the shooting. After a year or two living on savings, these families are now left without jobs and at risk of losing their homes, all because they never got things back on track from the shooting. We work with people in these types of situations to help them make bills, help with transportation so they can get back to work, and in general doing anything we can to make their lives a little better. Many people are taking time off for the trial and finding it much hard to cope with the proceedings than they expected. Aurora Rise is ready to help everyone we can through this tough time every step of the way.</p>
<p>The other part of the Aurora Rise mission is to support the Aurora Community and make sure those lives lost in the theater will never be forgotten. To this end, we have established the Aurora Rise Scholarship Program which will offer scholarships to local students.</p>
<p>From the beginning, Aurora Rise has been supported by the comic book industry. We were all very shaken to see such a tragic event happen during a Batman movie. The comic community immediately sought to help anyway that they could. With their help, we have been able to keep Aurora Rise going for three years. Aurora Rise believe that superheroes are an important factor in how we work with the community; we do everything from our sketch books to movie showings and working with local cosplayers. Aurora Rise wants everyone in the community of Aurora, the comic community, and everyone who has supported us that you are our heroes.</p>

</div></div>","Our Story Aurora Rise is a 501(c)(3) non-profit founded to provide direct support to those people affected by the Dark Knight Rises Aurora theater shooting on July 20, 2012 and to ensure that those we lost will never be forgotten.  
Aurora Rise has seen the power of superheroes up close as we have worked with comic creators, publishers, writers, artists, and cosplayers to bring the Aurora community together. In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, many people in the comic book industry reached out to local comic book store, All C's Collectibles, to see how they could help. Aurora Rise's first fundraiser in August of 2012 brought together comic book artists for a signing event and a live auction with thousands of donations, many from the comic book industry. 
We have continued to use superheroes to inspire the community through our fundraisers and events. We have worked with dozens of artists who donate comic book sketch covers for us to compile into compilations sketch books, the profits from which go to support our mission.
With your help, Aurora Rise is looking to expand with our next project. We want to work with artists to create a compilation coffee table style art and scrap book that tells the story of Aurora Rise and the people we have been working with, while compiling amazing superhero art work. We will use the funds raised from selling the book and excess funding to expand our own programming to include memorial scholarships and more.

<p>That's me at age 4. From childhood, I’ve always loved baking. At 14, my first real job was at a bakery. As I got older, I began working at corporate jobs to get more experience in my field of graphic design/marketing. Even while working full time and going to school full time, I always managed to find time to bake. After earning my degree, I settled into a full time desk job, but the baking started to fill more and more of my time.</p>

<p>Slowly, my coworkers began to know me more for my treats than the work I was being paid to do at my job. I started receiving orders from coworkers asking if I could bring in scratch made cakes or cookies or ice creams for their celebrations. Eventually it became clear to me that it was possible to pursue a career I had real passion for: baking.</p>

<p>In 2009, I took the leap and started full time pastry school in the evenings, while maintaining my day job. I sacrificed free time and started working weekends at a local bakery to get my feet back into the retail baking. After completing my first semester of school, I said goodbye to the corporate world and hello to a full time bakery job.</p>

<p>I worked at 4am five days a week, while still going to school 5 evenings a week. I maintained this pace for the next year, while helping open two new bakeries in the area. Before the start of my final semester, I left retail baking to build a pastry program from the ground up at Ces &amp; Judy's, the premiere catering company in St. Louis. In May 2014, I graduated with my associates in applied science with an emphasis in Baking &amp; Pastry, and became a Certified Pastry Culinarian through the American Culinary Federation.</p>

While getting SugarBot off the ground, I worked a few overnight shifts a week helping my good friend and St. Louis' very own doughnut savant, Vincent Marsden of Vincent Van Doughnut, make doughnuts.

</div></div>","Welcome to the crowdfunding page for SugarBot Sweet Shop’s brick-and-mortar storefront, a soon-to-be full service, 100% from scratch, American-style bakery at 433 Jackson Street in the heart of St. Charles, MO. We’ll be specializing in childhood favorites even better than you remember them - with offerings including: layer cakes, cupcakes, muffins, scones, cheesecakes, pies, cookies (classic and decorated iced sugar), ice cream, craft sodas, and other confectionary delights. We’ll have options that cater to the general public, as well as items that are safe choices for special diets, such as low glycemic, gluten/wheat free, peanut free, and dairy free.


SugarBot's Background 


That's me at age 4. From childhood, I’ve always loved baking. At 14, my first real job was at a bakery. As I got older, I began working at corporate jobs to get more experience in my field of graphic design/marketing. Even while working full time and going to school full time, I always managed to find time to bake. After earning my degree, I settled into a full time desk job, but the baking started to fill more and more of my time.

  
Slowly, my coworkers began to know me more for my treats than the work I was being paid to do at my job. I started receiving orders from coworkers asking if I could bring in scratch made cakes or cookies or ice creams for their celebrations. Eventually it became clear to me that it was possible to pursue a career I had real passion for: baking.

  

In 2009, I took the leap and started full time pastry school in the evenings, while maintaining my day job. I sacrificed free time and started working weekends at a local bakery to get my feet back into the retail baking. After completing my first semester of school, I said goodbye to the corporate world and hello to a full time bakery job.

  



  



I worked at 4am five days a week, while still going to school 5 evenings a week. I maintained this pace for the next year, while helping open two new bakeries in the area. Before the start of my final semester, I left retail baking to build a pastry program from the ground up at Ces & Judy's, the premiere catering company in St. Louis. In May 2014, I graduated with my associates in applied science with an emphasis in Baking & Pastry, and became a Certified Pastry Culinarian through the American Culinary Federation.

  



  



Last September, after a full year of catering parties both large and small, it was clear to me that I was ready to make my biggest jump yet - to leave the stability of full time employment and start doing my own thing: SugarBot Sweet Shop.


  


While getting SugarBot off the ground, I worked a few overnight shifts a week helping my good friend and St. Louis' very own doughnut savant, Vincent Marsden of Vincent Van Doughnut, make doughnuts. By day, I met with clients and vendors, baked and perfected recipes, wrote business plans, and scouted locations for our shop’s future home.
     After months of potential site visits, and a roller coaster of hopes rising and falling, we found a building in an excellent location with a lot of potential. After looking over the demographics for the area, the traffic studies for the intersection, and the other businesses nearby, we decided it was just what we’d been looking for.

    Our Current Standing 
Building Plans: Our building plans have already been drawn up by our architect and approved by the city of St. Charles, as well as the historic board.
Building & Financing: Our Small Business Association Loan through St. John’s Bank has been granted, and we used a portion to purchase our building in mid-May.
Permits & Licenses: There are a several permits and licenses needed to open a bakery, and with each one comes application, registration, and processing fees.
Renovations: When we closed on the building, it was set up as a retail shop without a kitchen, commercial or otherwise.

Risks & Challenges

Opening a storefront bakery isn't all sprinkles and disco dust - there's a lot of hard work involved too.  
Cost: As shown in the previous section, starting a bakery is not an inexpensive task. Many costs are accrued and due before the doors can open, and this campaign will help bring in the income to balance those costs.
Getting Started: Countless studies show that it’s typical for a small business to not show any profits for the first year (or more!) of their opening day.

<h3><b>Our Story</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Spirit Lake Idaho is a small
town in the panhandle of north Idaho. A beautiful mountainous area that
attracts thousands of visitors every year. The attractions are plentiful year
around. The town is walking distance from one of the most beautiful lakes in
the world, only seven miles from two fabulous 18 hole golf courses. We enjoy
ATV trails in every direction, horse trails, hiking trails and feature many
miles of bicycle trails. The bike trails offer every level of riding in and
throughout the scenic mountains surrounding the area. Wonderful country wide
views and plenty of wildlife to see on every ride. There are three large
destination ski mountains with-in 30 miles of our town and a huge theme park
only eight miles away. Hunting, fishing and camping are a way of life.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>The only thing missing in
our historic small town is enough rooms to put our visitors up overnight. We
have some camp sights and some small local rooms available but there are no
new, clean motel rooms within 20 miles of our town. However, if you would like to visit us before our motel is completed there is a 100+ year old historic hotel with rooms available downtown. Our Indiegogo campaign is
an attempt to help fund the building of a new motel in our over 100 year old
town.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431629373/dddp6jdxa5wgbenu72wt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The land has been purchase,
the architectural work is complete and ground should break in a few weeks. Much
of the project is already funded. We are using this crowdfunding tactic for two
reasons. To help you and to help us. If we can raise some of the needed money
to help reduce our interest and bank payments, we can keep our cost down. This
will translate into lower rates to our guest. Secondarily but more important we
can offer reduced price perks to our campaign contributors. These rooms will average
about $90.00 per night depending on time of the week and time of the year. As
an incentive we can offer an overnight use of the facilities for every $50.00
contributed to this campaign. (More in perks).</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3>Why Now?</h3> Our town is growing; the chamber of commerce along with
some local visionaries has recognized our area as what is quickly becoming a
destination bike riding area. Many miles of single track technical riding
trails are being added every month. Bike riders will be coming from many parts
of the world to experience the true beauty of this area. Bike trail heads are
being added daily. A new parking area and bike trail head downtown sets the
stage for bike riders of all ages and abilities. We just need a place for them
to stay while they are enjoying our friendly fun loving town and area.<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431375793/gnzwnehqelfuclbozqo7.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 418.66px; height: 314px;""/></p>
<p><strong><i>Spirit Lake in the distance from the top of Mt. Spokane</i></strong></p>
<p><b>Some of our small town assets</b></p>Our motel will be located
on Maine Street downtown. It is a short (two block) walk to a grocery store,
convenience store, liquor store, gift shop, city hall, hardware store, book
store, bank, post office, full service salon, two parks, three restaurants
(kids welcome), one beer and wine bar, one cocktail lounge, one
lounge/restaurants and one lounge / restaurant/ sports bar/party bar. We also
have a new lakeside park featuring 300 feet of beach with kayak and bicycle
rentals. Our guest could conceivably park at the motel with their bike, or rent
a bike, and not have to drive for their entire stay.</div><div>

<p><b><i>Kayaking is very popular on our
beautiful 1500 acre lake.</i></b></p>
</div><p>
</p><p><b></b></p><h3><b></b></h3><p></p><h3>Perks</h3><p></p><p>As pointed out earlier in our story one of our favorite advantages to crowdfunding this project is what we can give back. Our average room rent will be about $90 per night to our non-contributing guest. This rate will vary due to season, weekends and premium scheduling. We are offering our contributors as many $50.00 per night room as you desire. If you selected to contribute $1,000.00 to our campaign you would then be eligible to stay with us for 20 nights (no additional charge). $5,000.00 would get you 100 nights. Obviously $50.00 would get you one night stay in our new motel. Any contribution in $50.00 increments will be appreciated and apply to your stays with us.</p><p>Your $50.00 nights are not available Friday or Saturday unless booked for at least Thursday through Sunday. This is a 22 unit motel. Only half the rooms will be available for contributors during peak season. Premium nights may be available for an additional fee.</p><h3>Perk 2</h3><p>These nights that you accumulate are transferable. Contribute enough for 20 nights and bring guest to use 4 rooms for 5 nights all together. Or, you can send your son in Seattle a three night package for his next birthday present. Use your imagination. Pick up extra $50.00 per night stay vouchers now for your vacation to the Pacific Northwest in 2020. Fully transferable and will not expire. Use for your own pleasure or gifts to friends and family.</p>Please join us:<p></p><p>If you are looking at this campaign you are probably
aware of the surge of e-bike manufactures involved in crowdfunding projects.
You may even be involved in some of these campaigns, as I am. The extra perk
from joining our campaign is to have a place to travel where like minds will be
enjoying all of the advantages of a bike riding destination area.</p>

<h3>
<b>Do Some Homework:</b> </h3><p>Check out our Spirit Lake Idaho Chamber of Commerce web
page, things to do and bike trails. Also check Silverwood Theme Park (8 miles),
Mt Spokane Ski area (20 miles) Schweitzer Mt. Ski area (25 miles), Silver Mt
ski and year around waterpark ( 30 miles). Spirit Lake events. One of the
largest lawn mower drag races in the U.S. (Father’s Day). Labor Day at the
park. Bike rides, Car Show, tons of fun. City wide swap meet and Blue Grass in
the park. (first Sat. in Aug.). Winter wonderland. We often get plenty of snow
for all outdoor winter fun. Cross country, snow shoeing and snowmobiles
included.</p>
<p><b>Time frame</b>; as
previously mentioned the property has been purchased and is free and clear. The
architecture and business plan are both complete. The city is behind the
project and all permit requirements have been fulfilled. As soon as the
financing portion of the project is determined the building will begin. This
motel should be open for your enjoyment in early 2016. With your help, even
earlier. </p>
<p><b>Your
Perk Verification; </b>when
the campaign is complete each contributor will be issued verification vouchers.
The vouchers will be individualized with your specific accounting of
days/nights available for your use, and Id. passwords. Remember, the vouchers
will never expire and they are transferable. We will require identification
when you redeem your voucher. If transferring your voucher we will need you to
verify your password so we can transfer the voucher. We will recommend you
start making your reservation ASAP to increase your chances of getting your
most desired dates.</p>
<p>Priority will be given the
earliest the highest contributions. As the opening date is determined the first
and the highest contributors will be notified. At this point priority dates can
be reserved. This will allow for large contributors to reserve bundles of
rooms. For instance, if someone contributed $10,000.00 they could then bundle
20 rooms @ $50.00 per night for 10 days. This could allow someone to book the
entire motel for a large wedding party, corporation retreat, etc. </p>
<p><b>Financial needs; </b>the finished motel is projected at $880,000.00. The land
and initial architectural work have already been secured. The process is
started and we have nearly $100,000.00 invested to date. Another $140,000.00 is
in a bank ready to be used for the down payment. We would like to fund 5% ($44,000.00)
of the total cost using crowdfunding. This number allows us to get the best
rates at the bank and it does not exceed the quantity of rooms available for
reservations by our contributors. If we reach and exceed the crowdfunding
figures the money will be used to reduce bank financing and pass the savings on
to our guest.</p>

burnt over 3,000,000 board feet of the mills stockpile. It is the general consciences

between negative growth and overwhelming growth. This project will help me

some local visionaries has recognized our area as what is quickly becoming a
destination bike riding area. Many miles of single track technical riding
trails are being added every month. Bike riders will be coming from many parts
of the world to experience the true beauty of this area. Bike trail heads are
being added daily. A new parking area and bike trail head downtown sets the
stage for bike riders of all ages and abilities. We just need a place for them
to stay while they are enjoying our friendly fun loving town and area.

  
Spirit Lake in the distance from the top of Mt. Spokane
Some of our small town assetsOur motel will be located
on Maine Street downtown. It is a short (two block) walk to a grocery store,
convenience store, liquor store, gift shop, city hall, hardware store, book
store, bank, post office, full service salon, two parks, three restaurants
(kids welcome), one beer and wine bar, one cocktail lounge, one
lounge/restaurants and one lounge / restaurant/ sports bar/party bar. We also
have a new lakeside park featuring 300 feet of beach with kayak and bicycle
rentals. Our guest could conceivably park at the motel with their bike, or rent
a bike, and not have to drive for their entire stay.

Kayaking is very popular on our
beautiful 1500 acre lake.

PerksAs pointed out earlier in our story one of our favorite advantages to crowdfunding this project is what we can give back. Our average room rent will be about $90 per night to our non-contributing guest. This rate will vary due to season, weekends and premium scheduling. We are offering our contributors as many $50.00 per night room as you desire. If you selected to contribute $1,000.00 to our campaign you would then be eligible to stay with us for 20 nights (no additional charge). $5,000.00 would get you 100 nights. Obviously $50.00 would get you one night stay in our new motel. Any contribution in $50.00 increments will be appreciated and apply to your stays with us.Your $50.00 nights are not available Friday or Saturday unless booked for at least Thursday through Sunday. This is a 22 unit motel. Only half the rooms will be available for contributors during peak season. Premium nights may be available for an additional fee.Perk 2These nights that you accumulate are transferable. Contribute enough for 20 nights and bring guest to use 4 rooms for 5 nights all together. Or, you can send your son in Seattle a three night package for his next birthday present. Use your imagination. Pick up extra $50.00 per night stay vouchers now for your vacation to the Pacific Northwest in 2020. Fully transferable and will not expire. Use for your own pleasure or gifts to friends and family.Please join us:If you are looking at this campaign you are probably
aware of the surge of e-bike manufactures involved in crowdfunding projects.
You may even be involved in some of these campaigns, as I am. The extra perk
from joining our campaign is to have a place to travel where like minds will be
enjoying all of the advantages of a bike riding destination area.


Do Some Homework: Check out our Spirit Lake Idaho Chamber of Commerce web
page, things to do and bike trails. Also check Silverwood Theme Park (8 miles),
Mt Spokane Ski area (20 miles) Schweitzer Mt. Ski area (25 miles), Silver Mt
ski and year around waterpark ( 30 miles). Spirit Lake events. One of the
largest lawn mower drag races in the U.S. (Father’s Day). Labor Day at the
park. Bike rides, Car Show, tons of fun. City wide swap meet and Blue Grass in
the park. (first Sat. in Aug.). Winter wonderland. We often get plenty of snow
for all outdoor winter fun. Cross country, snow shoeing and snowmobiles
included.
Time frame; as
previously mentioned the property has been purchased and is free and clear. The
architecture and business plan are both complete. The city is behind the
project and all permit requirements have been fulfilled. As soon as the
financing portion of the project is determined the building will begin. This
motel should be open for your enjoyment in early 2016. With your help, even
earlier. 
Your
Perk Verification; when
the campaign is complete each contributor will be issued verification vouchers.
The vouchers will be individualized with your specific accounting of
days/nights available for your use, and Id. passwords. Remember, the vouchers
will never expire and they are transferable. We will require identification
when you redeem your voucher. If transferring your voucher we will need you to
verify your password so we can transfer the voucher. We will recommend you
start making your reservation ASAP to increase your chances of getting your
most desired dates.
Priority will be given the
earliest the highest contributions. As the opening date is determined the first
and the highest contributors will be notified. At this point priority dates can
be reserved. This will allow for large contributors to reserve bundles of
rooms. For instance, if someone contributed $10,000.00 they could then bundle
20 rooms @ $50.00 per night for 10 days. This could allow someone to book the
entire motel for a large wedding party, corporation retreat, etc. 
Financial needs; the finished motel is projected at $880,000.00. The land
and initial architectural work have already been secured. The process is
started and we have nearly $100,000.00 invested to date. Another $140,000.00 is
in a bank ready to be used for the down payment. We would like to fund 5% ($44,000.00)
of the total cost using crowdfunding. This number allows us to get the best
rates at the bank and it does not exceed the quantity of rooms available for
reservations by our contributors. If we reach and exceed the crowdfunding
figures the money will be used to reduce bank financing and pass the savings on
to our guest.
Key Personnel; 
Doug Freeland, motel property
owner, motivator, investor and dreamer. I live on Sprit Lake only one mile from
the future motel site. My family has been a part of the town and local area for
nearly 85 years. Both of my grandfathers worked for the lumber mill which was
responsible for the towns founding in 1907. It was a dream of my family to help
this small town survive and flourish in a way that would only improve and
benefit the town and surrounding area. My parents and grandparents have all
passed now with their dream still active in my hopes for the future. This small
town has survived its share of setbacks, including the huge fire of 1939 which
burnt over 3,000,000 board feet of the mills stockpile. It is the general consciences
of our town that a motel will give us the chance to find some economic balance
between negative growth and overwhelming growth. This project will help me
fulfill some of my family’s hopes for the future of our town.

We offer Coming of Age Programs and mentoring to youth ages 11-15. Since 2010, we have been giving a powerful rite of passage experience to youth and families, without any outside funding.

</div></div>","Short Summary

     Rooted Emerging is a small nonprofit in Bellingham, Washington. We offer Coming of Age Programs and mentoring to youth ages 11-15. Since 2010, we have been giving a powerful rite of passage experience to youth and families, without any outside funding. We are at capacity now for what we can create, with two six-month programs and a monthly return involvement group for girls. In 2014, the organization's 20 members logged 2,065 volunteer hours. The Director position (25-30 hours/week) is still unpaid. We are in transition now to become an independent 501(c)(3) nonprofit - and we need your help to make it happen!
   By contributing now, donors can be part of a movement to bring a celebratory, community-wide experience to youth at sexual maturity. Our ancestors knew a deep sense of place by coming together to mark life transitions, and claim their new role within their villages. We believe there is something valuable to be reclaimed of personal and community health by bringing this practice current. Contributing now ensures that this model of modern rites of passage can continue to joyfully rise up.



What We Need & What You Get

   We need to reach $6720 this summer to successfully move into our next phase. Programs start in the fall and we are already preparing for our start of year events in September. The allocation of funds will look like this:
 Scholarships - we consistently have requests for financial assistance, and have had to turn people away who could not afford $350 for our six month program. Below are listed full (families pay only a $50 deposit) and partial scholarship amounts.
     Girls Program                 Boys Program
         300                                     300         200                                     200           150                                      150          150                                      150     __________________________________                                                                1300
  Director - a stipend for 25-30 hours/week, coordinating Mentors, Interns, Board Meetings, Girls Return Involvement group & general administration. A minimum allowance until independent nonprofit status is achieved.
    ___________________________________                                                                1000
 Mentors & Teachers - we have 5 adults mentoring in each Coming of Age program. Mentor, Co-Mentor, Visiting Teacher (2-3 workshops + Culmination Weekend), Visiting Teacher (one workshop + Culmination) and Visiting Teacher (one workshop). Minimum stipends will greatly enhance our programs by giving incentive for wonderful people to stay on year after year.

________________________________________                                                                       2550
  Nonprofit application fee - to apply with the IRS for independent 501(c)(3) status, we must include a fee. We are already a nonprofit subordinate, with our own EIN. This step gives us the freedom and benefits of being our own organization, making future funding more accessible.
 ________________________________________Nonprofit application fee                          400
  Events & Operating - all the little costs (that rapidly add up) to make our community celebrations happen. 
 We start the year with three events. ""The Council of the Animals"" at Fairhaven Park welcomes young people in grades 5-8 to a story/riddle challenge and lets them experience our organization to see if they are a fit. The Director holds a Q & A session for parents in the Upper Shelter to learn about our philosophy and practices. ""A Masquerade Eve"" is our annual, all-ages Halloween celebration, a chance for the Director to announce and honor the Mentors who have signed on to serve in the upcoming year's programs. Lastly, we have a Roundtable Discussion event for professionals, with a Keynote Speaker, bringing education and resources to parents, teachers, counselors, healthcare workers and others who serve youth.

The Impact

  How are we impacting young people and our community? Here are a few things people have said, ""I think every boy and girl in Whatcom County should take this class. You see this magic in their eye, and there is no pressure to be anything other than who they are."" And, ""This is really part of healing the feminine in our culture, how every generation of women can give their daughters a little bit more..."". Every time a parent calls, with a sense of excitement and even relief to know that kind of support exists, we are giving hope.
  Here are a few outcomes our Interns are preparing to measure:  healthy body image for young people at puberty - fewer teen pregnancies - an understanding of boundaries & negotiating romantic relationships - a deep sense of inner worth - resilience - lowering overall stress levels for families - lowering rates of teen depression - lowering rates of self-harm - less suicidal ideation - less risk-taking behaviors - increased confidence - willingness to speak up for oneself - positive recognition - sense of place - connection.




Risks & Challenges

  This age group can be hard to reach. If the idea comes from parents, it is sometimes met with resistance. Fortunately, when the suggestion comes from past participants the kids can really identify and get excited about it. Our return involvement program, the Girls Advisory Board, is working right now to extend outreach into the local middle schools through presentations - and involvement in our upcoming events.

With minimum stipends, folks could count on compensation, and bring a higher level of commitment to their role as Mentor or Teacher. All of us are trained annually as 4-H Leaders and Rooted Emerging Mentors, with screening and insurance through 4-H.

<div>
<p>Jug Creek Distillery was founded in 2015 by Heath Frazier
&amp; Kyle Luttrell. As close as brothers, the two have shared a
great love of high quality spirits for many years. In 2009, great
state of Tennessee made Heath &amp; Kyle's dream of owning their own distillery a real
possibility with the legalization of craft distilleries. Since then, a few distilleries have paved the way, but overall demand for local craft spirits largely outweighs the supply. So while you still
can’t make your own Moonshine &amp; Bourbon at home, the good news is we are
prepared to make it for you! </p>
<p></p>
<p>    <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434048316/aw1z4qa87evps0mzxj2v.png"" src="""" style=""width: 571.594202898551px; height: 340px;""/></p>
<p>In the nature of transparency, we admit that our first love
and the bread and butter of Jug Creek Distillery is our Bourbon. However,
as we all know, it takes time to age a good Bourbon to perfection- at least two
years to be exact (the older the better). So while we will be steadily
barreling our bourbon for a rainy day 2 years down the road, we will keep the doors open by starting with Moonshine. Who knows, there may even be the
occasional limited supply of Rum, Brandy, or Vodka available! Have no fear though, we are dedicated to making our Moonshine some of the best to pass through your lips for many years to come. While Moonshine has
traditionally been more of a “hillbilly” spirit, we want to make a high quality tasting alcohol with combinations of flavors unique to
us.</p>
<p>In addition to providing you with premium quality spirits, we also want Jug Creek Distillery be an outdoors event venue that can serve as a scenic location for many events and occasions. Although the partaking of our fine spirits is reserved for adults, we want Jug Creek to be a family friendly environment (bring the kids!) where you can tour our facility, then enjoy a lunch on our picnic tables while taking in the scenic beauty of the rolling hills. Our goal is to become a destination people want to visit for family and social events as well as a venue for live music and various entertainment that will help bring tourism to Wilson County. </p>
<p>The original plan was a goal of distilling by January 2017 and opening to the public by March, 2017. However, we have made some pretty great connections with people so that date may be accelerated by many months! We can't promise anything sooner just yet, but promise to keep you guys in the loop as we check things off of our list.</p>

<p></p>
<p>We are inviting you to be a part of something special by
becoming an official “Juggite”. Now you may be wondering, what in the world is
a Juggite? Well, simply put, Juggites are our followers who are helping to
make this dream a reality! You are friends, family, and even strangers to us.
You appreciate quality craft spirits and want to help keep the “spirit” alive!
Because you hold such a special place in our hearts, we want to reward you for
your faithfulness. Every membership will enroll you in our newsletter that will
keep you updated on our progress, as well as bring you information on specials
and events to come. More perks will be offered after we open, and the initial membership will be good for one year after opening to the public. Take a
look at our three levels of membership we offer and decide which one is right
for you! </p>
<p>**Contingencies: Due to the nature of our awesome memberships, we do have to require
that you be 21 in order to choose a membership option that includes a liquor voucher. All vouchers must be redeemed on distillery premises and no alcohol will be shipped. Naturally, vouchers will only be
redeemable once all permitting through the regulatory agencies have given us
the go ahead to distill. It would be a little hard to make our dream a reality
if we were in federal prison for illegally distilling without the proper taxation and permits!</p>

<h4>The Grand Opening</h4>
<p>Because we are still in the planning phase, we will want you
to be part of deciding what should be included in our Grand Opening
celebration! While we aren’t allowed to ""serve""alcohol on the premises, you are
more than welcome to throw back a tasting (after showing ID, of course) and
purchase your own bottle! We have many things in mind and
are confident that this will be one party you don’t want to miss. Anyone that
knows us knows that one thing we know how to do is to throw a good party! Food,
entertainment, and good company are sure to be included in this. You never know
if someone famous might even show up. After all, we are located right outside
of Music City, otherwise known as Nash-Vegas, home to many celebrities. This will be a ticketed or guest list only event, so make sure you are included! We cannot guarantee that more tickets will be available after the close of our campaign so don't miss out. </p>

</div></div>","THE DREAM...

Jug Creek Distillery was founded in 2015 by Heath Frazier
& Kyle Luttrell. As close as brothers, the two have shared a
great love of high quality spirits for many years. In 2009, great
state of Tennessee made Heath & Kyle's dream of owning their own distillery a real
possibility with the legalization of craft distilleries. Since then, a few distilleries have paved the way, but overall demand for local craft spirits largely outweighs the supply. So while you still
can’t make your own Moonshine & Bourbon at home, the good news is we are
prepared to make it for you! 

    
In the nature of transparency, we admit that our first love
and the bread and butter of Jug Creek Distillery is our Bourbon. However,
as we all know, it takes time to age a good Bourbon to perfection- at least two
years to be exact (the older the better). So while we will be steadily
barreling our bourbon for a rainy day 2 years down the road, we will keep the doors open by starting with Moonshine. Who knows, there may even be the
occasional limited supply of Rum, Brandy, or Vodka available! Have no fear though, we are dedicated to making our Moonshine some of the best to pass through your lips for many years to come. While Moonshine has
traditionally been more of a “hillbilly” spirit, we want to make a high quality tasting alcohol with combinations of flavors unique to
us.
In addition to providing you with premium quality spirits, we also want Jug Creek Distillery be an outdoors event venue that can serve as a scenic location for many events and occasions. Although the partaking of our fine spirits is reserved for adults, we want Jug Creek to be a family friendly environment (bring the kids!) where you can tour our facility, then enjoy a lunch on our picnic tables while taking in the scenic beauty of the rolling hills. Our goal is to become a destination people want to visit for family and social events as well as a venue for live music and various entertainment that will help bring tourism to Wilson County. 
The original plan was a goal of distilling by January 2017 and opening to the public by March, 2017. However, we have made some pretty great connections with people so that date may be accelerated by many months! We can't promise anything sooner just yet, but promise to keep you guys in the loop as we check things off of our list.

                        


WHAT WE NEED...

 
As it turns out, opening a distillery can be pretty
expensive! While we fully anticipate to sign away at least one of our children
to a bank for loans, there are still plenty of expenses that we need your help
for. Here is a quick rundown of the major categories of expenses required to make this
dream a reality:



Equipment necessary to make, bottle & distribute that fine Bourbon and Moonshine: approximately $150,000


Permitting with the federal, state, & local authorities
to make it all legal and lawyer fees: $15,000 (optimistically)


Property and building construction: $250,000 (give or take
$50K or so)








As you can see, we don’t think your hard earned money will go to waste, and we clearly are not too proud to beg! We set a modest goal $20,000 but would love to raise in the range of $60,000 With $20,000 we could...


Attend a swanky distilling university so we have this biz down to an art 

Pay for permitting through the federal, state, and local regulatory agencies 
Pay lawyer fees associated with local red tape and business formation matters

With $60,000 we could...

Pay for construction of the building 
Hire a landscape architect to design the ultimate distillery location and everything necessary to make that a reality 
Improve our product branding/logo design and website


THE PERKS (WHAT YOU GET)...
So now you ask yourself, ""Well, of course I want to contribute, but what do I get in return?"" We wouldn’t think to ask you to give without also giving back! We
have put together some pretty great rewards that we think you’ll really like as a way
to say thanks for believing in us.  Some
of these will be redeemable sooner than others, but all will be awesome.

""Risks and challengesAs small business owners, my wife and I understand and accept that adversity will always be one of the biggest factors in our path to creating a life saving product and a successful business.The time is takes to create such a high quality handmade product has produced a huge amount of challenges that we have overcome by hard work and dedication, but we know there are an astronomical number of even bigger challenges we will face as time rolls on.That being said, I pledge to you - with my word - that I will do everything in my power to stand by my commitment and oath of creating the best products that I can possibly make within the allotted time we have given ourselves for this Indiegogo project. You will receive the best of what our brand has to offer.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

I'm Tamy, the owner and creator of maca. More likely than not, you've seen me around the greater Boston area chit chatting about my love for macarons.<br/><br/>I grew up in the restaurant business, loving food. From a young age, I learned how to bake everything from the classic chocolate chip cookie to homemade pies (fun fact: raw pie dough is my favorite).

</div></div>","Short Summary I want to create a website,  videos and tutorials about C# and .NET tools and common practices. Think about  verticals( logging, security) that every application needs to have. 
It will be a common knowledge base(book, video and website , and mobile application ) about how to use those applications.
  What We Need & What You Get
We need to implement the site ,to write the book and to make the mobile application and the videos( already having a part of those at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4aSKgR4yk4OnmJW6PlBuDOXdYk6zTGps )
 We have the main things to be presented - and we want to be a common source of knowledge. We want, after the launch, to be crowd sourcing of tools for programming.

The Impact
We are sure that everyone had problems when they began to think how to do different tasks in the application and what is the best way to do it.

This product will make available to everyone a sure path to find knowledge and tools to work fast and reliable.

Risks & Challenges
 
Too many existing resources are written by seasoned experts who have trouble relating to the perspective of what the problem is and how it should be addressed . This book will be different. 
My goal is to use my experience of 17 years in programming to make an approachable narrative. 

The risk for the book and  website is that will be not so fashionable - I am not an expert designer. However the information and the examples will be easy to reproduce them in your work.
Also English is not my mother tongue - so the book and the videos and the website must be proof checked.

Other Ways You Can Help
 You can spread the word by going to github : https://github.com/ignatandrei/toolsForProgrammers 
You can help with the design of the book / website and / or forwording questions .

that doesn’t define me and neither should the wages most companies want to pay
me. 
</b>I shared my dream with Mike of someday having a job that pays a
livable wage so I can support myself 100%. I do not enjoy needing public
assistance to survive. <b>I dream of getting my driver’s license, a car, and starting a family.</b> When Mike proposed to start a company together that can help make mine and others dreams
come true I said,<b> “When do we start?” </b></p>- Hello, I’m Mike Hauser and also a proud co-founder of <i>One Are We</i>.  I was fortunate to meet Randy and the other
athletes three years ago while coaching for Special Olympics.  Randy and this
dynamic community have been a true inspiration for me. <b>I think you will be
equally inspired when you hear their incredible stories and accomplishments.</b>  <b>When Randy shared his dream with me, a
dream that many of us take for granted</b><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'><b>, </b>I knew I wanted to help him, and others in this
community, make their dreams come true while benefiting from their positive
attitude and inspiration.</span>

</div></div>","Randy & Mike

- Hi friends, my name is Randy Smith and I'm a proud co-founder of One
Are We.  I happen to have Cerebral Palsy, but
that doesn’t define me and neither should the wages most companies want to pay
me. 
I shared my dream with Mike of someday having a job that pays a
livable wage so I can support myself 100%. I do not enjoy needing public
assistance to survive. I dream of getting my driver’s license, a car, and starting a family. When Mike proposed to start a company together that can help make mine and others dreams
come true I said, “When do we start?” - Hello, I’m Mike Hauser and also a proud co-founder of One Are We.  I was fortunate to meet Randy and the other
athletes three years ago while coaching for Special Olympics.  Randy and this
dynamic community have been a true inspiration for me. I think you will be
equally inspired when you hear their incredible stories and accomplishments.  When Randy shared his dream with me, a
dream that many of us take for granted, I knew I wanted to help him, and others in this
community, make their dreams come true while benefiting from their positive
attitude and inspiration.


What will the money be used for?
Our Indiegogo campaign is seeking $10,000. The net proceeds will
provide us with needed seed money and exposure. We will use the net proceeds to
develop future products and further develop our marketing campaign. The expanded product
line will be marketed to our smaller retail and
corporate accounts. This will create more jobs and advocacy capabilities.
Meeting or exceeding our goal will help prove
to companies and possible investors that our proof of concept works. 
Please join with us in this social movement.

ABOUT OUR FOUNDERS

We will make
our mission happen – we have the business experience, corporate contacts, endless
passion, and you!


                       
Co-founder Mike has over
15 years experience running a company in the handmade fair-trade wholesale gift
industry and has witnessed a strong
movement for consumers and companies toward socially conscious products and
companies. Over the last 15 years Mike has established many small and large
retail contacts that One Are We will be pursuing.  
”We know the consumers will not only respond to our unique
products but also to our true social agenda. We not only provide gifts, but a
rewarding sense of altruism for the companies and the buyer. We will be a leader
in the industry.""
Co-founder Randy, who
has never let his Cerebral Palsy get him down, will be a great salesman and
ambassador for One Are We. The council running the 2015 Special Olympics World
Games chose Randy to be a Global World Messenger. Quite an honor. Randy has given
numerous public speeches and interviews in addition to being featured in the
Huffington Post. He has been employed where he made less than $1.00/hour, and he plans to change that at One Are We. “Never
bet against Randy” is something we continuously say.
We
are devoted to make all of our employees’ visions a reality.
Our Greater Vision:

We will grow the business so we can make a larger impact on the
American population. We have established a support base for our business
consisting of social conscious companies, individuals, family members and
friends of the disabled who have a big heart and wish to support and/or be
involved with us.
We are a company who corporations will want
to be affiliated with, inspiring them to follow suit in helping the disabled
community.
To the
amazing caregivers  - Our campaign would not be complete without giving a big shout out to all of you who
have devoted your lives to molding, encouraging, and supporting this dynamic
community. You have sacrificed so much – and we believe you are the true

<p>Art is very important. Art develops our mind and brings beauty into our
lives. Art is all around us and we don´t perceive it. </p>
<p>It’s said in the Czech Republic, ""<i>Every Czech is a musician</i>"",
but! In the Czech Republic people are not interested in art because it is
expensive or unavailable. Therefore, I would like to open a café, where people
will savour a cup of good coffee and listen to anything from classical music to
jazz and so on.</p>
<p>I want to help people with perceiving art but I would also like to support,
for example conservatory students and emerging artists. In the future, also an
amateur photographer whose photos galleries refused.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436430743/cmt5g4wehqpmulemilac.png"" src="""" style=""width: 23.2222222222222px; height: 33px; background-color: initial;""/></p>

</div></div>","Hello :). There is is very
little opportunity to find a place where art meets ordinary life in the Czech
Republic. I want to change it. I would like to open an art café with a music
program, author’s readings, later with a gallery and more and more. 





Art is very important. Art develops our mind and brings beauty into our
lives. Art is all around us and we don´t perceive it. 
It’s said in the Czech Republic, ""Every Czech is a musician"",
but! In the Czech Republic people are not interested in art because it is
expensive or unavailable. Therefore, I would like to open a café, where people
will savour a cup of good coffee and listen to anything from classical music to
jazz and so on.
I want to help people with perceiving art but I would also like to support,
for example conservatory students and emerging artists. In the future, also an
amateur photographer whose photos galleries refused.



These funds will cover:



Cafes equipment (tables, chairs, food, musical instrument, etc.)                      


Rent


Remodeling of the interior.


Exterior styling


Small advertising


Savings          



Points of interest:

""I received mugs into my dream café with the logo ""Dene
Cofee"" for Chritmass from my boyfriend. I hope I will not disappoint
him"" <3 


                                                                                                                                                                   


And why coffee?
Coffee is an amazing drink that is a pleasure, passion and still great
potential. I believe that someone who loves my coffee will also love all
the songs playing in my café.
So... help me and welcome to Dene coffe bar :).
I hope you're not offended for my English.
With love and big thanks, Jakub",39.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>About me!</b></p>
<p>Righto, well I'm a 28-year-old
woman, with over 10 years experience in the financial services industry (yawn).
I have a brilliant idea for a minimal outlay business that has the means to be
quite successful, but I need help, and I need cash to start up.</p>
<p>Currently there are no
mobile teeth whitening services in Toowoomba and surrounds, meaning - NO
COMPETITION. I can offer a service, at an affordable price ($150 approx,
compared to $600-$1000 at the dentist, all in the comfort of your own home!!)
Can you tell I'm excited?</p>
<p>I have always had an
interest in the beauty industry, so as an add on to teeth whitening, I'll be
also offering a mobile tanning business. Again, a market that is not highly
saturated in the region. As my clientele expands, and my business improves, I
will continue to engage in education and add services.</p>
<p>I'm basically asking
for a bit of help to do something I KNOW I'll be good at, and I KNOW that I’ll
love. If you can help in any way, it would really mean a lot.</p>
<p>Whether I can raise the money via crowd funding, or I
have to fund it myself, this is a venture I am passionate about succeeding in.</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What
You Get</b></p>
<p>Break down of funds
needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>$2500 - All tools needed to run the teeth whitening side of the
     business (LED light, treatment for 12 clients, signage, training and
     support).</li>
<li>$150 - Spray tanning course.</li>
<li>$1500 - All tools and equipment needed to run spray-tanning side of
     the business (Gun, portable booth, tanning solution).</li>
<li>$500 - Initial marketing.</li>
<li>$500 - Point of sale products.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any extra funds raised, will go towards
marketing and getting out there!! Every cent raised will go into building the
business.</p>
<p>What you get for
helping:</p>
<ul>
<li>$20 - Spray tan (Toowoomba and Darling Downs Region)</li>
<li>$50 - DIY teeth whitening kit (Nationwide postage)</li>
<li>$100 - In home teeth whitening service (Toowoomba and Darling Downs
     Region) </li>
<li>$150 - 2 in home teeth whitening service. One for you and a partner
     or friend. (Toowoomba and Darling Downs Region)</li>
<li>$500 - In home teeth whitening service PARTY for up to 6 people
     (Toowoomba, Darling Downs and BRISBANE regions)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not in an area where I am
able to offer you incentives to donate, and you would still like to help, that
would be AWESOME and KARMA will most definitely jump on your side!!</p>
<p>**You will be issued with a gift
certificate that will be valid for 24 months for all incentives.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Living in a smaller
rural town, work is slim. You will be helping me to build a business doing
something I feel really passionate about.</p>
<ul>
<li>I will be able to achieve good profit margins in an industry that

     this area).</li>
<li>You will help me maintain a family/work life balance with
     flexibility.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>The risk is minimal.
The market I'm targeting has little to no saturation. The outlay is minimal.
I'm passionate. To be as realistic as possible, a risk I can somewhat see is
not raising enough to be able to advertise and start strongly.</p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>

<p>It seems like if you talk to local cyclists about what the best routes are in Boulder and the surrounding area, you'll get a lot of the same responses. Flagstaff climb, Magnolia road and Sugarloaf are all staples if you're looking for some elevation gain. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Now if you ask me the same question I'll have an entirely different answer. Just over 30 miles from Boulder (and Loveland/Fort Collins), lies a little mountain town with so many great ride secrets and a place that my family and I call home.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Estes Park is located roughly 7500ft in the air and at the east entrance of Rocky Mountain National Park. If climbing is what you're looking for, you can get almost 5000ft of it from the entrance of the park to the top of the RMNP Visitors Center at over 11,500ft. It's riding perfection and only one of so many other great routes in the immediate surrounding area including a ton of mountain bike trails as well.</span></p>
<p>But aren't there a ton of bike shops in the area? There sure are!...about 30+ miles away. The closest being in Boulder or Fort Collins which is at minimum about 45 minutes away by car. This is both extremely inconvenient for locals and those looking for a mid-ride stop on their way through.</p>
<p>After being laid off right before my birthday in September 2014, I gave a lot of thought to what I wanted to do next. After over 15 years of working as a web/software developer for ad agencies, I decided to finally follow my passion and provide something valuable for my community at the same time.</p>
<p>The vision is to create a small shop with a big purpose: Provide Estes Park residents with a bike shop that they can be proud of. Service, sales, and a place to fuel up before, after or instead of riding. In addition, what we're looking to do is help introduce cycling to a younger generation as well as hundreds of thousands of seasonal tourists that visit this mountain town every year. Did I mention that we're also a cafe too (i.e. COFFEE AND FOOD)?</p>
<p>On a personal note, creating this in Estes Park is to fill the void of not having a shop to call home. I've heard from many of you that you're also feeling a little bit of that void.  So, whether you love bicycles, coffee, Estes Park, or just the idea of a small local-owned &amp; operated business, I'd love to know about it and have your support in one form or another.</p>

It seems like if you talk to local cyclists about what the best routes are in Boulder and the surrounding area, you'll get a lot of the same responses. Flagstaff climb, Magnolia road and Sugarloaf are all staples if you're looking for some elevation gain. Now if you ask me the same question I'll have an entirely different answer. Just over 30 miles from Boulder (and Loveland/Fort Collins), lies a little mountain town with so many great ride secrets and a place that my family and I call home.
Estes Park is located roughly 7500ft in the air and at the east entrance of Rocky Mountain National Park. If climbing is what you're looking for, you can get almost 5000ft of it from the entrance of the park to the top of the RMNP Visitors Center at over 11,500ft. It's riding perfection and only one of so many other great routes in the immediate surrounding area including a ton of mountain bike trails as well.
But aren't there a ton of bike shops in the area? There sure are!...about 30+ miles away. The closest being in Boulder or Fort Collins which is at minimum about 45 minutes away by car. This is both extremely inconvenient for locals and those looking for a mid-ride stop on their way through.

Did I mention that this oven is right in the window to the kitchen, so you can watch as we bake your delicious treats?</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">My goal is to be as efficient as possible with everything, especially energy. For that reason, I also want to acquire at least one but ideally two, standard-size <b>convection ovens</b> for times when I don't need the capacity of the huge, revolving oven.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul><li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Because my commitment to the environment is central to my business, I intend to purchase </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">compostable and biodegradable packaging made from plants </b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">and sold by a local, New England distributor.

</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Last, but not least, it is my desire for Jodi Bee Bakes to be a bakery and café where the community (and visitors) can gather in a welcoming and warm atmosphere. Thankfully, I've secured a space large enough to do this but a bigger space requires more paint, chairs, couches, tables and, if finances allow, a rustic, reclaimed-wood table large enough to host the <b>vegan and gluten-free pop-up dinners and high tea services</b> I'd love to offer! </li>

Well, now that we have the bakery, you don't ever have to make that tough decision again because you'll be able to mix and match your dozen. Oh the freedom!


Well, we're already on our way to making those visions a reality! Our first order of business was to remove the fake, potted plants that were hanging from the ceiling!

Big improvement with limited effort and NO money. Score!
But not everything is like fake, potted plants; there are other steps that require a little more effort and money. Here are some things I need your help with:


I was lucky enough to find a space that has an enormous, built-in bagel oven - check it out!
Sadly, the unit hasn't been used in years but if we can get it serviced and bring it back to life, I'm thinking vegan & gluten-free bagels are a necessity! Did I mention that this oven is right in the window to the kitchen, so you can watch as we bake your delicious treats?



My goal is to be as efficient as possible with everything, especially energy. For that reason, I also want to acquire at least one but ideally two, standard-size convection ovens for times when I don't need the capacity of the huge, revolving oven.


Because my commitment to the environment is central to my business, I intend to purchase compostable and biodegradable packaging made from plants and sold by a local, New England distributor. I'm so excited about the quality and durability of the products I've found but at more than triple the cost of those average products that end up in landfills, it's a bigger investment.


Who doesn't love chocolate? My beloved gluten-free & dairy-free coconut macaroons are hand-dipped in it! Because of the ever increasing demand for them, I'd like to invest in a chocolate tempering machine to simplify production and I have the perfect spot for it: right in the window to the kitchen so you can watch us happily dipping away as well as baking.


Last, but not least, it is my desire for Jodi Bee Bakes to be a bakery and café where the community (and visitors) can gather in a welcoming and warm atmosphere. Thankfully, I've secured a space large enough to do this but a bigger space requires more paint, chairs, couches, tables and, if finances allow, a rustic, reclaimed-wood table large enough to host the vegan and gluten-free pop-up dinners and high tea services I'd love to offer! 


    Why Participate?
Here are some reasons why you should be involved in this campaign:


A vegetarian, a vegan and a gluten-intolerant person walk into a bakery . . .and they all eat great food together. No joke!

Our commitment to the environment inspires you.
You've had our food and want more of it!
You see the value in supporting small, local businesses.

The absolutely amazing perks. Check them out!


    Risks & Challenges I believe that I've positioned myself for success but opening a new business is never without risk. Right now, my biggest challenge is ensuring I stay on schedule; that means not letting perfect get in the way of excellence! I need to continue to find creative ways to bring you the best experience possible while staying on time and on budget. As with everything in life, balance is the key. 
    Become a Part of the Jodi Bee Bakes Family
The support and enthusiasm of people like you, my generous donors, and my amazing, loyal customers has been invaluable these past two years and helped keep me going even when the going wasn't easy. Your financial support will go a long way in helping to acquire the important things detailed above and make the Jodi Bee Bakes bakery and café a reality!But for me, launching this business isn't first about the money, most importantly it's about my passion to make great food for great people. So, if you find yourself wanting to help but not able to donate, please consider a donation of your own passion: spread the word and share a link to this campaign. Do you have insight, time, or supplies to spare? Just let me know! Have you tried my food and loved it? Explain to others why it is important to have a neighborhood bakery and café where you can get a vegan breakfast or a gluten-free lunch or just a really sinful dessert! You are advocating more than just a bakery, you are advocating for a business that has a mission to bring people joy and honor the planet while we do it, and I (and Mother Nature) sincerely thank you for it!",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

 you wanted a house so you built one? What if we wanted a car so we 
built one? If we need fuel we grow it. If we need food we grow it or 
raise it, and we know whats in it because we grew it. We'll know whats in 
everything because we'll make it, and we'll teach other people to do it too.

houses as I want, and invite you all to come work and party. That's just
 one idea. There have to be loop holes upon loop holes. Ways to beat the
 system. Ways we can live together work together and party. That's what 
this life is about. When we are doing it right, when we follow the 
Golden Rule it's one huge party. It's a great life to live. <br/></p><p>My name is Kyle Wood, and I am fortunate enough to live in the Pacific North West.  There is a saying here
amongst friends ""Pacific North Blessed."" I agree with all my heart.  Despite all of my trying to flee when I was
younger God kept bringing me back home. I've been blessed. Not by my own works,
but by grace. Last week I got baptized, yesterday I became a certified pastor (you can do it online), today I'm asking you to help me
show the world a better way. </p>
<p>Did I mention I'm a tattooer? I provide free space for the artists who work
at my shop. There is no rent or percentage, they pay to the shop what they
can, and it works. I take care of them, and they take care of me. I don't
charge for tattoos either. My clients take care of me, and I take care of them.
It's a beautiful way to live and I just did an interview with Inked Magazine
about it yesterday. I'm also gathering people together to shoot a documentary
about this whole project this summer. What better opportunity to show the world
what Christianity really looks like? Quoting another friend ""why wouldn't
ya?"" </p>
<p>The tattoo shop was just the beginning; I believe God has led me to build a
community here in Kingston, a city on a hill, if you will. A beacon of light. A
community 100% self-sustaining in the world but not of the world. With the one
true God at the forefront, I want to build a community under the Golden Rule:
love each other. If anyone is thirsty they will have something to drink. If
anyone is hungry they will have something to eat. If anyone needs a roof they
will have one. If someone asks me to walk a mile, I'll walk with them two. If
we are given generously we will give generously. Do you remember anything you
crammed for in school? Nope, neither do I. I remember what I was taught
standing next to someone though. We learn one way. I learned it in the Army; ""I
do, we do, you do.” That’s what true discipleship looks like.  I did it with my tattoo shop, help me do it
with this community, then we can show the world: I do, we do, you do. What are
we doing? Passion over profit!</p>
<p>You will never find a private jet on this property, you will never see a
campaign donation, you'll only see change. Real change. You will find joy, real
joy you can taste. The whole point is to have no money at the end of every year. I'm not saving for retirement, I don't believe it's for me. I find joy in working and helping other people get to where they are going, I can't see my personality changing at any age. Whatever I am given is going to go right back to helping other people. </p>
<p>Through tattooing my community I have met all of the people that we need to
start. Architects, engineers, lumberjacks, earth movers, organic farmers,
care givers, foster parents, musicians, producers, directors, cinematographers,
photographers, designers, screen printers, nurses, carpenters... the
list goes on and on. The one thing we don't have is a 22 acre $800,000 lot of land. It has a lake, it has green houses, it has a giant barn (venue, community center) and it has a shop. It has everything we need to get started and it's for sale, right now. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>2 Corinthians 9</p>

</div></div>","We created a log siding so historically authentic it boggles the eye!  Better yet, it discourages the need to tear down old historic cabins for their reclaimed logs!  
Our Home Started a Nationwide Trend!


Hi Folks, I'm Richard Gunst and this is my wife Chris on the deck of our newly built cabin home in 2005, high above Breckenridge, Colorado. 
After decades of graphic arts and studio set design, I retired the theatrical glitz of Southern California and together we hit the dusty trail for Breckenridge Colorado. 
Our Dream! Build a cabin, hike, bike, ski and visit some great Old Ghost Towns. But, while visiting them we noticed ODD that would change our Lives Forever. 
Sporadic footprints where buildings once stood, were gone! Then we found out why. Reclaimed wood brings BIG dollars, sold into Private Estates never to be seen by the public again!  We started thinking, ""If this continues the only thing left to visit will be... Photo Graphics!
Little did we know we were about to change things. 
After completing our Log Cabin Home, the drive by compliments were over the TOP! Most everyone loved our home and wanted to know where we got our logs. The Idea hit us like a Lam Beg Drum, Loud and Clear! 


Pioneer Log Siding was Born!

Pioneer is crafted using the same type of tools our ancestors used plus, a few updated to meet the demand. Our wood is Doug Fir, Kiln Dried from the same types of trees our ancestors used.   




Pioneer Log Siding requires NIL to NO upkeep. The older it becomes the more authentic it appears. Unlike factory milled boards, concrete or plastic,  Pioneer Log Siding is the real frontier McCoy!

LOOK AGAIN! This Log Wall is a SIDING!  





Our Passion: 

""Preserving Historic Cabins Across America!""

Pioneer Log Siding has become a great solution over reclaimed logs. Historic structures like these are being dismantled daily for their logs. Our customers have told us that without Pioneer they would have chosen old historic reclaimed logs. 


If we continue to tare down these old historic structures for                                   their logs, The only thing left for anyone to visit will be Photo Graphics. HELP us Save these old Historic Places!


Each time Pioneer Log Siding is used, another cabin is saved. To continue we must relocate to the central part of the United States.
Relocating our business to the Central part of the United States will save our customers on their shipping costs and place us a Building for the first time.
Help is needed BUT, only if we can give BACK! 


We're offering some GREAT PERKS for contributions of any size, especially if you plan to transform your home into a Mountain Retreat!              


               Please contribute to only one Perk.

Funds are for... 




To Relocate: We need to relocate our BUSINESS from Washington State to the Central part of the United States. This would save our Eastern customers on their high shipping costs and place us in a dryer climate.   

A Building: We've always worked outside in the worst kinds of weather. It's always, ""Duck for cover, here it comes Again!"" We fight extreme winds and thrashing rains for days on end. It's tarps on and tarps off several times a day.

Working inside a BUILDING would be a Blessing! 

This is where we create countless Pioneer projects.  But, most of our efforts are lost struggling with the weather, covering and uncovering then ducking for cover. The building interior belongs to someone else.

<p><b><u>El Ranchito Economic
Development Project</u></b></p>
<p>Global Effect is a non-profit mission organization that exists to bring hope, change lives, and transform communities in impoverished areas around the world. One of the ways that Global Effect is able to do these things is through an economic development program that creates jobs for people in the impoverished areas. As part of Global Effect’s community transformation and economic
development mission, an agricultural project is being launched. The economic impact this
project will have on a very poor community in the central part of the Dominican
Republic is astronomical and will exponentially impact the entire
community.  The project will create a
minimum of fifty (50) new full-time jobs and one hundred (100) new part time
jobs for workers directly employed by the agricultural project manager.  Based on minimum salaries being paid to
workers in the fields, there will be on average $240,000 pesos (approximately
$5,000 US Dollars) going into the community weekly.  In addition to the jobs created directly by
the project, a minimum of fifty (50) new jobs will be indirectly created to
provide services to the workers in the field including but not limited to:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Food preparation and delivery to the site, </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Vegetable inspectors hired by export companies, </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Drivers to load and pick up crops from the
fields and deliver to exporters and local purchasers, and</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>People to grow plantings from seeds that will
then be planted in the fields.</p>

This project consists of purchasing 23 acres of farm land in El Ranchito, Dominican Republic where fruits and vegetable will be grown and then exported.  The amount of income going into the community
weekly will also have a huge impact on other local businesses, churches and
families in the area.  With the net
profit from this project, the agricultural project manager(s) will be paid a
weekly salary which will also be income going back into the community.  With a portion of the net profits, benefits will
be provided to the workers in the fields (for example, funeral insurance,
health insurance, and funds available for emergency needs.)  In addition, Global Effect will also earmark
a portion of the net profits to other programs that will have a spiritual,
economic, and educational impact:<p></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Education programs (e.g., after-school tutoring,
scholarship funds, and character leadership high school program),</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Business development (e.g., micro-lending, job
creation activities, and apprenticeship program), and</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Community Outreach (e.g., partnering with local
churches to meet community needs, establishing a food coop, and funding
Authentic Manhood programs).</p>
</div><div> <p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b><u>Project Budget</u></b></p>
<p>The following budget is based on information gathered from the project
manager (Carmelo Vasquez).  Carmelo has
been involved in all phases of agriculture in the Dominican Republic for over
20 years.  Carmelo has been serving with
Global Effect over the past 4 years in the community of El Ranchito where he
grew up and still lives.  Carmelo has
demonstrated over the past 4 years his passion and great desire to help the
people in his community.  He envisions
this project as a way to not only provide jobs for people in the community but
a way to minister and demonstrate the love of Christ.  Included in the budget is the salary for a US
person to oversee the project with Carmelo and who will live in the area for a
minimum of 7-8 months during the start-up phase of the project.  This US person will be accessible daily to
Carmelo as well as Global Effect USA to ensure the project is moving forward,
communication channels are open and funds are available and being appropriated
as planned.</p>

</div></div>","El Ranchito Economic
Development Project
Global Effect is a non-profit mission organization that exists to bring hope, change lives, and transform communities in impoverished areas around the world. One of the ways that Global Effect is able to do these things is through an economic development program that creates jobs for people in the impoverished areas. As part of Global Effect’s community transformation and economic
development mission, an agricultural project is being launched. The economic impact this
project will have on a very poor community in the central part of the Dominican
Republic is astronomical and will exponentially impact the entire
community.  The project will create a
minimum of fifty (50) new full-time jobs and one hundred (100) new part time
jobs for workers directly employed by the agricultural project manager.  Based on minimum salaries being paid to
workers in the fields, there will be on average $240,000 pesos (approximately
$5,000 US Dollars) going into the community weekly.  In addition to the jobs created directly by
the project, a minimum of fifty (50) new jobs will be indirectly created to
provide services to the workers in the field including but not limited to:
· 
Food preparation and delivery to the site, 
· 
Vegetable inspectors hired by export companies, 
· 
Drivers to load and pick up crops from the
fields and deliver to exporters and local purchasers, and
· 
People to grow plantings from seeds that will
then be planted in the fields.

This project consists of purchasing 23 acres of farm land in El Ranchito, Dominican Republic where fruits and vegetable will be grown and then exported.  The amount of income going into the community
weekly will also have a huge impact on other local businesses, churches and
families in the area.  With the net
profit from this project, the agricultural project manager(s) will be paid a
weekly salary which will also be income going back into the community.  With a portion of the net profits, benefits will
be provided to the workers in the fields (for example, funeral insurance,
health insurance, and funds available for emergency needs.)  In addition, Global Effect will also earmark
a portion of the net profits to other programs that will have a spiritual,
economic, and educational impact:
· 
Education programs (e.g., after-school tutoring,
scholarship funds, and character leadership high school program),
· 
Business development (e.g., micro-lending, job
creation activities, and apprenticeship program), and
· 
Community Outreach (e.g., partnering with local
churches to meet community needs, establishing a food coop, and funding
Authentic Manhood programs).
 


Project Budget
The following budget is based on information gathered from the project
manager (Carmelo Vasquez).  Carmelo has
been involved in all phases of agriculture in the Dominican Republic for over
20 years.  Carmelo has been serving with
Global Effect over the past 4 years in the community of El Ranchito where he
grew up and still lives.  Carmelo has
demonstrated over the past 4 years his passion and great desire to help the
people in his community.  He envisions
this project as a way to not only provide jobs for people in the community but
a way to minister and demonstrate the love of Christ.  Included in the budget is the salary for a US
person to oversee the project with Carmelo and who will live in the area for a
minimum of 7-8 months during the start-up phase of the project.  This US person will be accessible daily to
Carmelo as well as Global Effect USA to ensure the project is moving forward,
communication channels are open and funds are available and being appropriated
as planned.

<p>My name is Madison Knight and I currently reside in Shawnee, Kansas. Growing up, my biggest dream was to finally own a dog of my very own. My sophomore year in college, my dreams came true when I rescued my first puppy at 5 weeks old, a blue heeler-lab mix named Dexter. I knew from the minute I saw him, I was already in love. In December, we celebrated Dexter's first birthday. One thing I have never been able to do however, is leave Dex at a dog boarding center. I can tend to be a little over protective of him, but he is my first puppy, and was solely my responsibility. My boyfriend also had a puppy of his own, a german shepherd mix named Ted. Dexter met Ted when he was only 6 weeks old and since then, they have been absolutely inseparable. Now I had two dogs that I was absolutely in love with, and always wanted the best care possible for them. I have had multiple scenarios, where I was needing to board them, mainly family vacations where dogs were not allowed in the hotels. I had researched every dog boarding center within 50 miles of my home, and only one seemed to satisfied my requirements. Excited, my boyfriend Patrick and I took Dexter for a meet and greet of this facility, and what I saw absolutely horrified me. Chain linked fences surrounded dirty concrete floors where the dogs were kept that were covered in feces and urine. On the website, they boasted their outdoor playground, where the dogs could explore and receive their daily exercise. What they showed me was horrendous. A few broken pieces of old children's playground equipment were scattered across a patch of dirt. After deciding against boarding him, I had researched a few places more, further from my home. I saw a common trend among these places: they did not feel like home. My dog is my world. I felt the safest when I was able to leave him with a family member or a close friend. That is what I want my business to feel exactly like that. It will always feel comfortable to leave your dog in a place where you can trust they are being treated exactly as they should. A dog is one of the most important aspects of a family, so why would you send them to a place where they would not be treated that way? That's when I vowed that I wanted to start a business. My dream was a homey, boarding and daycare center where no owner ever felt skeptical that their dogs were getting less than amazing care. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Starting my dream business is definitely not cheap. What sets us aside from most of our competitors is our idea of building our business on a significant amount of land. Also, we are wanting to be within a reasonable distance of our customers. With our current goal of $20,000, we will be able to get a start on purchasing our land and begin the designing and building of our facility. Our very own boarding center included dreams of building on land with at least a couple of fenced in acres. I also want amenities for the dogs to enjoy such as a separate exercise area with equipment for dogs to play with and complete with an indoor area for the dogs to play if the weather is unmanageable, and a dog pool for the pups to cool down in during those warm summer days! For overnight care, I want to be absolutely cage free. Individual rooms for each pup to enjoy while being furnished with their own bed, but still being roomy enough for their owners to bring in their own belongings to make their pup's stay as comfortable as possible. Another aspect is I want owners to be able to stay in contact with their dog, especially during overnight stays. I want to set up a digital stream that is accessible online where owners can watch their pups at play or happily dreaming and everything in between.  I dream of a boarding center that dogs will leave happy and exhausted after a day of play. Owners will be able to pick up their dogs confident that they were provided with the best possible care during their stay. Our current goal is pretty far reaching. But you can feel safe that every single penny that is donated will go towards the business. Even if we are not able to reach our set amount, every contribution helps!</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In today's day and age, dogs are just as much a part of the family as ever. They receive the best care at home, and there is no reason that they should not receive the best care everywhere else. Our business does one thing that many boarding facilities do not: we cater to the dog. We set out to provide the best experience for your loved one, while also making it easier for owners to leave their pups at a place they can trust. At the end of the day, we want to see happy pups leaving with happy owners.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>To set us apart from our competitors, our business has to stand out. I am not willing to take shortcuts in order to become more profitable, especially if it lowers the quality of care. Currently, I am in progress to graduate with my BHS from the University of Missouri next May. Without any prior experience in business, my partner Patrick Daly will be handling the financial standpoint of the business. He currently holds a Business and Finance degree from Central College. Nowadays, many business owners are only in it to get a paycheck. This is the most important factor that I believe will truly set us apart. My true goal in this business is to provide our customers with an excellent service, profit will not be an overwhelming factor on our end. As our business grows, I am hoping to provide our own line of healthy and organic treats and dog accessories, including collars and leashes. In the future, we are hoping to expand to include other services, such as grooming. To ensure that our business is built with all of my ideals in mind, it can cost upwards of $200,000. With other financial obstacles in our way such as insurance, permitting fees and licenses, every contribution helps! You can help us start a new generation of the pet friendly business!</p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<div>
<p>Twin Dragons Yachts is a new boat building company that
specialises in unique green technology and design for high performance
catamarans and small boats.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">
</span></p><p>We’re sailors, and passionately
love the ocean. We wanted to build the most exciting boat in the world. One
that won’t harm the environment. </p><p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span>
</p>
<p><b>The Dragon TD15 is a noble,
powerful craft. </b></p>
<p>It is a hydro foiling cruising
catamaran that is fast in the lightest breeze and can fly along in the teeth of
a gale without having a sail blowout. It is yacht without normal sails or fossil
fuel engines, and is as easy to sail as it is to drive a car. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">This boat is a high tech marvel,
stable and easy to control even when things get rough.</span></p>
<p>At 15 metres long (50 ft) and 8,6
metres wide (28ft), it has wave piercing bows, hydrofoils, aerofoils and twin
wing masts. Plus a luxurious interior that caters to all the physical comforts
you want on a boat. </p>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430910836/wtpjtk26m8nfayyqbtfw.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>It’s an intelligent boat that
cooperates with you and takes the hard work out of sailing. Intuitive control
systems and sensors constantly maintain stability, position and sail
deployment.</p>
<p>Wind and solar energy ensures a
constant supply of electricity and power. Innovative technology calculates your
course, maintains your track and adjusts the sails and hydrofoils every few
seconds. The Dragon almost sails itself. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We guarantee that you’ll be swept
away by the power and performance of the Dragon.</span></p>
<p><b>Wing sails</b></p>
<p>Wing sails (aero foils) provide extreme
power and amazing performance. The Dragon will sail up to 10 degrees into the
wind – this angle of attack is unheard-of in monohulls, and impossible for
catamarans (the sails start flapping and your boat loses power). </p>
<p><b>No more tacking</b></p>
<p>The most exciting thing about the
Dragon is that it <b><i>never </i></b>tacks – that’s right, no boom to swing, no sails to
adjust. No ropes to trip over. The mast and the sails do it all, no matter what
direction the wind comes from. Sophisticated control systems ensure that you always
have powerful acceleration and performance at your fingertips.</p>
<p><b>Hydrofoils</b></p>
<p>The hydrofoils lift the boat out
of the water to make it super fast and exceptionally stable. Custom-built
controls keep all systems functioning smoothly. Super-effective electric motors
ensure zero noise pollution, so you can glide into marine reserves and watch
the manta rays and turtles feeding under your boat undisturbed. You’ll drift
over magical underwater vistas and not one creature will know that you’re
there, a silent spectator that leaves the environment as pristine as you found
it.  </p>
<p>Solar panel arrays and electric
engines mean that there will be no oil or fuel leaks from the Dragon – ever. No
diesel fumes. Even the tender (dinghy) has an electric engine. </p>
<p>The latest carbon fibre and
exotic materials make the boat light and fast. All materials that touch the
ocean surface are plant based and environmentally friendly. </p>
<p><b>Our experts</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Innovation always attracts
attention, and the Dragon team has been fortunate enough to have experts in the fields of aeronautical engineering, boat building, exotic
materials and solar energy advising us and overseeing how we implement these
new technologies. </p>
<p><b>A Healthy Planet</b></p>
<p>We aim to raise awareness of the
amazing new green products that are being invented now, and actively encourage
people to find constructive ways to repair the environment. We’re very aware
that our choices can ensure that the children of the future will have clean
oceans and a healthy planet. </p>
<p><b>Progress</b></p>
<p>We’ve done extensive research and
experimentation since starting in August 2014, and the aluminium hulls for the first
TD15 were built up to the first chine in November 2014. </p>
<p>We built an experimental single
hull kayak in January 2015, and after sea trials in March 2015, established
that the composite material has the correct strength for the bigger boat,
established that the foil positioning was correct, determined the floatation
centre of gravity and qualified that all our design ratios are correct. The
investment in the test kayak was successful.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Small Craft</b></p>
<p>Our small craft follow the radical design of the TD15 hull, and give a sense of excitement and speed to a new class of craft. </p>In April 2015, we began building
a scaled-down version (7.1m) of the TD15 called the Kymaran, to further test
our mast and sail concepts. Work on this prototype is nearing completion, and
we’ll have video footage of the first sea trials by the end of May. <p><b>Quality</b></p>
<p>The
personal attention that is lavished on each boat ensures that everything works
for the comfort and safety of all sailors on board. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430917169/ry3xo80wxgjvrxilxiws.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Visit our website at <a href=""http://www.twin-dragons.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.twin-dragons.org</a> for some more information.<br/></p>
<p>We are now entering the next phase of the project to complete the TD15 demonstrating that luxury does not come at the cost of the environment. Being lovers of the environment and the sea, we wish to provide a solution to the yachting world that does not pollute the seas. The principles we are using will be scalable to be usable on large ships. </p>
<p>Imagine a sea with no more oil spills! You can be a part of this revolution in environmentally friendly innovations.<br/></p>
<p>Videos of the sea trials of the Kymaran will be made available within two weeks, so keep an eye out here!</p>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We require more funding to achieve our goal of launching the TD15 by December 2015.  </p>
<p>We are seeking £100,000 in to reach the next phase of development. This will be broken down into materials, rent of premises and cost of building, including the salaries of the engineer and workshop staff for the next 6 months. This phase will allow us to complete the first catamaran to a point from which sales will commence. We do not envisage further funding to be necessary after this as sales of the Kymaran and the TD15 will then carry the business from there on.</p>
<p>The funds will be disbursed as follows:</p>
<p>Rent: £15,000</p>
<p>Operating expenses: £15,000</p>
<p>Materials: £70,000</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We will begin production of the
Kymaran in June 2015 once sea trials are completed. Our
marketing campaign will commence at the end of May. Sales income from Kymaran will be used to keep the business
running until we have reached our financial funding target.</p>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>There is a growing trend for ""green"" yachts that
are carbon neutral.  Although yachts are generally more
environmentally friendly, many people wish to have even less of a detrimental impact
to the oceanic environment. </p>
<p>The demand for a cruising catamaran that can perform well

Twin Dragons Yachts is a new boat building company that
specialises in unique green technology and design for high performance
catamarans and small boats.

We’re sailors, and passionately
love the ocean. We wanted to build the most exciting boat in the world. One
that won’t harm the environment. 


The Dragon TD15 is a noble,
powerful craft. 
It is a hydro foiling cruising
catamaran that is fast in the lightest breeze and can fly along in the teeth of
a gale without having a sail blowout. It is yacht without normal sails or fossil
fuel engines, and is as easy to sail as it is to drive a car. This boat is a high tech marvel,
stable and easy to control even when things get rough.
At 15 metres long (50 ft) and 8,6
metres wide (28ft), it has wave piercing bows, hydrofoils, aerofoils and twin
wing masts. Plus a luxurious interior that caters to all the physical comforts
you want on a boat. 







It’s an intelligent boat that
cooperates with you and takes the hard work out of sailing. Intuitive control
systems and sensors constantly maintain stability, position and sail
deployment.
Wind and solar energy ensures a
constant supply of electricity and power. Innovative technology calculates your
course, maintains your track and adjusts the sails and hydrofoils every few
seconds. The Dragon almost sails itself. We guarantee that you’ll be swept
away by the power and performance of the Dragon.
Wing sails
Wing sails (aero foils) provide extreme
power and amazing performance. The Dragon will sail up to 10 degrees into the
wind – this angle of attack is unheard-of in monohulls, and impossible for
catamarans (the sails start flapping and your boat loses power). 
No more tacking
The most exciting thing about the
Dragon is that it never tacks – that’s right, no boom to swing, no sails to
adjust. No ropes to trip over. The mast and the sails do it all, no matter what
direction the wind comes from. Sophisticated control systems ensure that you always
have powerful acceleration and performance at your fingertips.
Hydrofoils
The hydrofoils lift the boat out
of the water to make it super fast and exceptionally stable. Custom-built
controls keep all systems functioning smoothly. Super-effective electric motors
ensure zero noise pollution, so you can glide into marine reserves and watch
the manta rays and turtles feeding under your boat undisturbed. You’ll drift
over magical underwater vistas and not one creature will know that you’re
there, a silent spectator that leaves the environment as pristine as you found
it.  
Solar panel arrays and electric
engines mean that there will be no oil or fuel leaks from the Dragon – ever. No
diesel fumes. Even the tender (dinghy) has an electric engine. 
The latest carbon fibre and
exotic materials make the boat light and fast. All materials that touch the
ocean surface are plant based and environmentally friendly. 
Our experts


Innovation always attracts
attention, and the Dragon team has been fortunate enough to have experts in the fields of aeronautical engineering, boat building, exotic
materials and solar energy advising us and overseeing how we implement these
new technologies. 
A Healthy Planet
We aim to raise awareness of the
amazing new green products that are being invented now, and actively encourage
people to find constructive ways to repair the environment. We’re very aware
that our choices can ensure that the children of the future will have clean
oceans and a healthy planet. 
Progress
We’ve done extensive research and
experimentation since starting in August 2014, and the aluminium hulls for the first
TD15 were built up to the first chine in November 2014. 
We built an experimental single
hull kayak in January 2015, and after sea trials in March 2015, established
that the composite material has the correct strength for the bigger boat,
established that the foil positioning was correct, determined the floatation
centre of gravity and qualified that all our design ratios are correct. The
investment in the test kayak was successful.

Small Craft
Our small craft follow the radical design of the TD15 hull, and give a sense of excitement and speed to a new class of craft. In April 2015, we began building
a scaled-down version (7.1m) of the TD15 called the Kymaran, to further test
our mast and sail concepts. Work on this prototype is nearing completion, and
we’ll have video footage of the first sea trials by the end of May. Quality
The
personal attention that is lavished on each boat ensures that everything works
for the comfort and safety of all sailors on board. 

Visit our website at www.twin-dragons.org for some more information.
We are now entering the next phase of the project to complete the TD15 demonstrating that luxury does not come at the cost of the environment. Being lovers of the environment and the sea, we wish to provide a solution to the yachting world that does not pollute the seas. The principles we are using will be scalable to be usable on large ships. 
Imagine a sea with no more oil spills! You can be a part of this revolution in environmentally friendly innovations.
Videos of the sea trials of the Kymaran will be made available within two weeks, so keep an eye out here!
   What We Need & What You Get We require more funding to achieve our goal of launching the TD15 by December 2015.  
We are seeking £100,000 in to reach the next phase of development. This will be broken down into materials, rent of premises and cost of building, including the salaries of the engineer and workshop staff for the next 6 months. This phase will allow us to complete the first catamaran to a point from which sales will commence. We do not envisage further funding to be necessary after this as sales of the Kymaran and the TD15 will then carry the business from there on.
The funds will be disbursed as follows:
Rent: £15,000
Operating expenses: £15,000
Materials: £70,000


We will begin production of the
Kymaran in June 2015 once sea trials are completed. Our
marketing campaign will commence at the end of May. Sales income from Kymaran will be used to keep the business
running until we have reached our financial funding target.
Some of the exciting perks you can get for investing include:


·  Be a partner in the boat that is going to change the
face of leisure sailing forever.
·  Sail with us across the Atlantic in the 2017 Cape to
Rio yacht race. 
·  Participate on a training course to learn how to sail the
Dragon.
·  Buy a superfast Kymaran at a special early bird
discounted price.
·  Get the coolest Dragon T-shirts and caps.
·  Our e-book on greener living and sailing.
·  A limited edition model of the Dragon.

    The Impact 

There is a growing trend for ""green"" yachts that
are carbon neutral.  Although yachts are generally more
environmentally friendly, many people wish to have even less of a detrimental impact
to the oceanic environment. 
The demand for a cruising catamaran that can perform well
in races has never been completely fulfilled in the yacht industry.
The TD15 will be a cruising catamaran that uses processor controlled hydrofoils
and wing sails along with sophisticated electronic control systems that will
deliver exciting performance as well as a comfortable passage. 
By utilising green technology, we are helping to lessen the destructive impact on the environment, raise awareness of green technologies and highlight the serious damage already done to the environment. Our technologies can pave the way for the future so that our children will be able to benefit from clean oceans and a healthy planet.
Your contribution will go a long way to making this a reality.
    Risks & Challenges 

Our designs are unique and offer a major technological
breakthrough in hydrofoiling performance. A hydrofoil is a wing like
structure that operates in water to create lift. Hydrofoils situated underneath
the boat lift the hull out of the water, increasing speed and performance by
reducing drag on the hull itself. Although we have tested the concept using a hydrofoiling kayak with 100% success, we have still to test this on a large working model. We have every reason to believe this will be just as successful.
Our next challenge is to perfect the solar energy systems. We have made tremendous advances already, but more development is still required to perfect this. 
We currently have a number of prominent experts in the fields of aeronautic engineering, boat building, materials and solar energy advising and overseeing these new technologies.

Nedikenya in collaboration with Medishare Africa are organizations aimed to alleviated poverty to the vulnerable people in Kenya through creation of sources of water for doing sustainable income generating activities. This organizations are run by Daniel Manthi and Benjamin Musunza respectively. (www.nedikenya.org and www.medishareafrica.org)
Here in Mwingi - Kenya annual rainfall is between 650 – 1250 mm, which is not sufficient to
sustain permanent rivers. The percentage of households collecting potable water
at reasonable distance of less than 30minutes is less than 12.9% and 9.3% during dry and wet season
respectively. The percentage of
people accessing water clean and sufficient water is lower compared to that of
the province 23.4% and national 30%. This calls for more effort to enhance the
available water sources for utilization by the community.

This campaign will help us  construct an earth dam which will be used as sources of water for the community people for both domestic and agribusiness activities to generate some income to sustain their families.



     What We Need & What You Get  With $122000 we will construct an earth dam which will be used as a source of water for the community people. During rainy season, the dam will be full of water which will be sustained till the next rainy season.
With the installation of a hand pump the community people will be using it to collect water for domestic use. Since we do so many community projects here in Kenya, if the targeted amount from the fund raising is not reached, we will use the available amount to do small projects like environmental conservation, youth empowerment, women empowerment, capacity building in agriculture and many other.    The Impact This project will be of great importance to the community because:-



Young girls and women in this area will now be relieved from the burden
of walking for long distance searching for water. 

Since now water will be
available and closer to them, this community will start some development
projects like growing vegetables creating sources of income(agribusiness) and increasing
nutritional value.

 I have gained experience though working with community on this kind of projects for several years. I have seen lives of people be transformed to better by utilizing the available resources.



    Risks & Challenges 


We face many challenges when working with community. Sometime some community people may not be willing to work if not paid if even the project is for their benefit. This is usually a challenge because there is usually no funds allocated for that. This forces us to do capacity building on the importance of that kind of project to them.

Other challenges is culture of different communities. But through it all we overcome because we have a strong spirit towards the work of the community. We believe that whenever there is a challenge, an opportunity is at the door step.

Jump to: Your Cash Machine ∞ Testimonials ∞ Sense of Meaning ∞ The Team ∞ The Main Features ∞ Timeline ∞ How You Improve Your Reward Per Hire ∞ Share & Improve.Have a question? We have the answer. Contact us at hello@donehire.com.Important: DoneHire is incorporated under the state of California and we are launching the first version of out platform with our pilot customers. We didn't launch this campaign for us, it's for you! So that you can improve your reward per hire before we launch our application for everyone! Before Uber, only taxi drivers were profiting from that market. Uber leveled the playing field so that everyone could benefit and profit from it. Uber not only is changing the transportation industry but also is improving the quality of life for thousands if not millions of people.That's what we are doing with the hiring industry.Organizations today are spending on average $4,000 per hire, reaching over $100,000 just for one hire. They have the budget, they have the money, so this is how you gain access to it:Turn Your Job Hunting Into a Cash Machine!It's beautiful: through DoneHire, get paid at least $1,000 for getting yourself, or your referral, hired! Yes, you read that right! Even if you are applying and you get the job, the money is yours! From the employer to you! Regardless if you are an employee or not of that company!So... why apply or refer candidates to job openings through a job board or any other website, when you can do it through DoneHire and make good money in the process?The better you are, the more you get!The better you are, the more you will make! When applying, your reputation will increase every time: 1- you apply and 2- you are hired. When referring someone, your reputation will increase every time: 1- your referral accepts your invitation to become a candidate for the job opening and 2- your referral is hired. So, for almost every action associated with applying or referring someone, your reputation will increase. The higher your score, the more money you will make per hire and organizations will have a higher consideration for your applications and referrals. You can win up to $4,000 per hire! There's one additional way you can increase your reward per hire. Once you are a user of DoneHire, you will be able to invite your friends to become DoneHire users and for every invitation that transforms into a new user, you both will get an additional $20 for the next reward you receive.Eliminating the noise and avoiding spamming!We want to help you be more profitable and we also want to help everyone fill the job openings faster and better, so we do that by eliminating all the noise generated by low-quality candidates that have no fit with the job openings. How? Every month we will give you at least 20 tokens to use where 1 token equals one application or one referral and you will see, from the example bellow, that's very easy to have more tokens per month by increasing your score. You can get up to 100 tokens per month!Here's an example of how your reputation increases with almost every action associated with you applying or referring someone, increasing your reward per hire and your tokens per month:
Click Here to Enlarge Image
What does it cost to use the system?It's completely free for job hunters and referrers. Companies pay the fee.This campaign is designed for the US market, organizations, and job openings. If you are located in another country you can still take this opportunity because you will be able to interact with the US openings. We will open operations in other countries, and for each one, we will probably have a different reward range, adapted to the country's economy.

The feedback and validation we have received have been so amazing that we finally had enough information to start developing and bring this solution to life.
Here are some of the comments we have received so far: (2 of the companies here are our pilot customers, 1 multinational and 1 company growing from San Francisco)
Here you can check the entire conversation our founder Carlos had with Karen Gaydon, the SVP of HR for Synaptics (www.synaptics.com):

At DoneHire we believe that all businesses should have a meaningful purpose that pushes them to go above and beyond their comfort zones, to improve quality of life and to leave this world better than they found it.
Not only DoneHire is built with a clear focus on improving lives, but there are also other amazing organizations out there already working hard to have a positive impact on life and our beautiful spaceship Earth. We want to support them!
We have made the decision of donating at least 6% of our business revenue to support organizations that we believe have the biggest potential for improving our lives.

</h1><h1>Short Summary</h1>
<p>Part of growing a
nation is to empower its people. African Grandeur is a retail outlet that buys
articles from skilled artists and designers in Africa. These items are then
imported and our aim is to grow the company and take it from the online
sales site, to having retail stores across the nation. </p><p><br/></p>
<h1>The Impact</h1>
<p>Together we can positively
impact the lives of many people living in Africa. The continent has so much to
offer, and we provide the channel for them to help spur growth. </p>
<p>It’s not only about buying
what they make. In some cases, we supply the tools and materials for them to make
their products. We can proudly say that our company actively creates jobs in

Part of growing a
nation is to empower its people. African Grandeur is a retail outlet that buys
articles from skilled artists and designers in Africa. These items are then
imported and our aim is to grow the company and take it from the online
sales site, to having retail stores across the nation. 
The Impact
Together we can positively
impact the lives of many people living in Africa. The continent has so much to
offer, and we provide the channel for them to help spur growth. 
It’s not only about buying
what they make. In some cases, we supply the tools and materials for them to make
their products. We can proudly say that our company actively creates jobs in
Africa. We will also be generating jobs within the United States with the retail
outlets we’re opening. 
Africa is a land of
picturesque beauty, intriguing sights, and fascinating sounds. The continent of
Africa continues to captivate the world. For not only is Africa endowed with
sensational wildlife, music and varied culture, it also boasts a variety of

</div><p><b><u>Sahabu’s
stillness</u></b></p>
<p>Every year in Uganda a
great percentage of children are born with disabilities and few live to
celebrate their 5<sup>th</sup> birthdays due to the unkind conditions that
distress them, either due to the recklessness of those close to them, long distances
to hospitals and clinics or just mere neglection from hospital staff whereby if
not given some money, they won’t administer treatment to them.  </p>
<p>Kisakye
sahabu was born 16 years ago in idogolo, a village in Jinja district, Uganda to
Naigaga Barbra and Muzamiru Menya who were both unemployed; Barbra a teenage
mother could barely afford a daily meal yet was abandoned by her reckless husband
who later denied responsibility of his family due to his son’s medical
situation that was at hand , Sahabu was then taken to his grandmother’s home
Mrs. Sssegonga Mary a 62 year old woman where with the help her other daughter Rachel
Magoola have managed to support, raise and protect Sahabu .</p>
<p>Rachel
Magoola Who turns out to be a maternal aunt to Sahabu tells his story as he
cannot talk, feed or sit on his own.</p>
<p>“Sahabu’s
situation started way back when he was 3 months old, he could not  do what 
a normal three month baby was supposed to do , he would neither move his
limbs nor play around , and respond to different sounds like other children of  his age; we didn’t know that these were the
first signs of his illness.  At 9 years
he developed a spinal cord disorder that has restrained him to his bed up to
today” she recalls. </p>
<p>“We
were then forced to take him to katalemwa, a rehabilitation centre with the
help of his grandmother where he was diagnosed with permanent paralysis, this
was the biggest blow our family could take because with barely enough support
from the father’s side both physical and financial, our greatest night mare hit
us the more” she goes on to lament. “We were asked to buy a wheel chair for his
support but then we couldn’t afford it not even could we afford a supporting
belt for his spinal cord. The cost of the wheel chair and supporting belt by
then (2014) was 2,298,000 Uganda shillings (USD $.686). This is thrice my
monthly earnings. </p>
<p>We
then desperately decided to let off some of his siblings stay away from school
just to help lift and assist him whenever he needed to either sit, feed, or
help himself. It has now become a burden to most of them who have decided to
run away from home because of the fatigue they have to face every day, so they
have let him be which has pushed his grand mother to restrain and help him
alone but as we all know its very difficult for a woman her age to manage.</p>
<p>In
2014, while on a Mobile clinic in Idogolo , Tiner Africa Foundation with the
help of Benjamin Musasizi and a group of medical doctors led by Dr.Chris Bingi
identified Sahabu who was found to weigh less his age and was put under special
care and the nutrition clinic for futher observation. Every month the
organization renders treatment and financial help to Sahabu’s family.</p>
<p>Currently
Sahabu’s greatest need is to get a wheel chair and to get him to a
rehabilitation centre where he can be helped to access the right treatment for
his situation.This will cost <b>USD $.5421.</b></p>
<p>Sahabu
will also need to be taken to a special needs education school once he is done
with his treatment to attain skills.</p>
<p>We
are now looking for friends and partners to help Sahabu and other children in
his category. Contact us on email address: <a href=""mailto:care@tinerfoundation.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">care@tinerfoundation.org</a> to get

<p>We
are glad to help people like sahabu with our different approaches tailored
towards meeting the most unique characteristics and needs of children as they
progress, join us fight ignorance among the grass root people , let as stand as
one and be part of a greater change in Uganda.  </p><p></p></div>","Sahabu’s

<p>Bed bugs are attracted to you while you sleep by the carbon dioxide (CO2) you exhale when you breathe.

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">What Makes ClearVue Traps So Effective?</span><br/>
</h3>
<p>ClearVue Traps intercept hungry bed bugs that come out of hiding seeking a meal. Our traps use a safe low-level carbon dioxide (CO2) beacon which mimics the exhaled breath of a human. This CO2 becomes highly concentrated within the base of the trap, forming a pocket of CO2 that bed bugs cannot resist. Natural instincts compel bed bugs to follow the CO2 beacon to its source where it is trapped on a glue floor. Once inside, the patent-pending design ensures trapped bed bugs can't escape.</p>
<p>Pesticide powder and spray treatments force bed bugs to flee and hide deeper inside your walls making the problem worse over the long run. In addition, pesticide sprays expose your home and family to potentially toxic chemicals.</p><p>ClearVue's active traps use no toxic chemicals or pesticides. Each trap takes less than a minute to prepare and place, and protects your family for weeks. We recommend replacing the traps monthly for continuous monitoring and protection.</p>

<p>ClearVue Traps have been field tested and proven effective in a number of locations:

</p><ul>
<li>A multi-family apartment with a severe infestation: After repeated use of ClearVue traps, several thousand bed bugs were captured and the tenants reported no more bites.</li>
<li>A major hotel that had been spraying rooms with pesticide powders and sprays for 15 years but couldn’t eliminate their bed bug problem:
Immediately following professional spray treatments (which can drive bed bugs deeper into the walls), physical inspections revealed no more bugs in the rooms. But placing ClearVue Traps continued to draw out and trap more bed bugs.</li>
<li>A validation test by a top regional pest control company in a house with an active bed bug infestation awaiting professional heat treatment: Hundreds of bed bugs were intercepted before they could reach their human hosts.</li>
<li>An apartment that had been sprayed weekly for nine weeks in a row: Within 15 minutes of placing a ClearVue trap, an adult female bed bug was captured.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Monitoring and Interception is EXTREMELY Important!</h3>
<p>Bed bugs can hide in paper-thin crevices and typically come out at night to feed on blood from you, your kids and your pets. Bed bugs are so incredibly tiny they’re able to spread from room to room using the wall outlets and air vents. If your neighboring apartment has bed bugs, you're only six inches away from having them too.</p>

<p><br/></p><p>Bed bugs only feed on fresh blood. In severe cases, people have been bitten up to 500 times in one night. By the time you see even one bed bug, there are usually hundreds or thousands more hiding nearby.</p>

<p>ClearVue Traps have been designed for superior performance using patent-pending technologies. Measuring just 4 inches by 5 inches by 1 inch tall, these traps are small enough to be hidden discreetly throughout your home.</p>
<p>Activate the trap by pouring the included Activation Liquid onto the sponge, placing the tablets on the sponge, and replacing the cap.  Once activated, simply place one trap on the floor at each bedpost at the head of your bed for monitoring, or one at all 4 bedposts for further protection.</p>
<p>The bed bug food beacon is produced using non-toxic, food-grade materials. The trap’s sticky surfaces are tucked away inside. The trap's design lets you easily see any trapped bugs.

<p>Play is the missing variable in current event discover platforms that fail to increase user interaction with the platform when the user is not in need of the event discovery service. Play's social interactions create an urge and dependency to return to the platform even when there is no need of event discovery services.</p>The concept is simple: people use Play to discover activities and events, Play connects people with activities and events, and businesses reach consumers through featured and non-featured targeted placement.<p></p> </div><p>Playen started to experiment early in 2015.

</p><p><b>WHO WE ARE</b></p>
<p>We are Tim
and NiQui Chatfield, married for 29 years, parents to 5 children and business
partners for 15 years. 2015 was a rough year to say the least – starting with
selling our home of 7 years and then a stage 3-cancer diagnosis for NiQui a
week later. It took all year, all of our energy and resources to battle the cancer. We lost our land that we had planned to build our homestead on.  Now it is a new year, and we are taking
charge of our lives with the knowledge learned surviving 2015. The lesson is to be self-reliant,
accountable, and consciously seek a simpler life. We have been devastated and it is time to rebuild - and we need your help to do that.</p>
<p><b>WHAT’S THE PROBLEM and WHY SHOULD YOU
CARE?</b></p>
<p>This campaign
is to fund the start of our new business, Sunshine Seasons that offers a variety of products for people wanting to scale back their life to better enjoy living with the land. This venture is a direct result of our own journey and learning what is truly important in life. As we are at a point in our lives where personal resources are scarce but passion and determination are abundant, we WILL make this all happen - we have to. Interestingly enough there is a season for everything in life – and Spring is the best time for us to start ... coincidentally it's the best time to start this type of business! </p>
<p>The physical
business located in Delaware County will offer a variety of products from the
tiniest of seeds all the way up to high-quality, Amish built tiny homes. Sunshine
Seasons has secured the property location, set up manufacturers that will
supply us with the quality products that we will be retailing <i>(see pics in the Photo Gallery)</i>. Also,
Sunshine Seasons has set up the network of local businesses and organizations
that share our mission. Why is this important? An essential part of the vision
is to partner and educate others on the benefits of this lifestyle. The only
thing missing is the funding to bring the whole vision to life.</p>
<p><b>WE NEED YOU AS A PARTNER</b></p>
<p>Your
financial contribution is essential to making this happen. Without you it will
not get off the ground. This is a valuable project you can be a part of from
the start by helping us cross the bridge to our new, better life and business. Together
we can make a difference for Tim, Niqui and most importantly our community.</p>
<p>This business
will serve a much needed market in the community and it will help us generate the money to buy land again (we lost our land last year)
so that we can build our own homestead like we have been dreaming of for the
last 10 years.</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>What exactly
is this new business? Homesteading products such as:</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Four Square Garden Kits</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Potting Sheds</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Tiny Homes</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Barns</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Chicken Coops</p>
<p>·<span>  Poly Furniture</span></p>
<p>How will we
sell them? Tim has been in sales for 20 years. We have secured a lease for an
excellent location on a high-traffic highway in Central Ohio. This allows us to exhibit
a homestead experience for people who visit and shop at our retail location. We
have also set up partnerships with an Amish Building Company for the sheds,
tiny houses, chicken coops, play sets, barns, and poly furniture.</p>
<p><b>Why do we need $20,000? </b></p>
<p>Funds will go
to the items in the order they are listed below: </p>
<p>1. Fees to
comply with Township and County Building Codes: $1,000</p>
<p>2. Utility
set up fees  $1000</p>
<p>3. Lease for
Commercial Property, $1500 per month, to get started we need $4,500</p>
<p>4. Excavation
of the site and prep for buildings: $2,000</p>
<p>5. Initial Marketing:
$2,000</p>
<p>6. Cost of
some of the Products to display and sell: $7,500</p>
<p>7.
Landscaping of the site and around buildings: $2,000</p>
<p>Total  $20,000</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454472449/f441kci8fsajw8pfv0x5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The most
important aspect is to secure the excellent location, prepare the nearly 1 acre
of land and be ready to sell. Many of our partnerships are placing products at

<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>We are very
excited to bring awareness; education and products to our community that will
help people realize a healthy, successful life of being more self-sufficient.
For the urbanite, the small land owner, business owners in the community –
learning to garden wherever you are, have a tiny home mentality wherever you are; take
care of yourself and ensure your own well-being.</p>
<p>With our
business Progress Academy/Polaris School we offered an affordable Kindergarten
through graduation curriculum package online to families all over the world. We
continue to want to build businesses that solve problems, help families and
improve the community we live in.</p>
<p><b>What Qualifies Us to do this Business?</b></p>
<p>We have run
several successful businesses and employed dozens of people in our history.
This is the first time we have done a campaign like this to ask for help
getting this new business started. We have set up very successful partnerships,
arranged an excellent location and lease, created a website, and have done our
research and practical application of the homesteading products. Now we simply
need help bridging the gap from where we are now to the launch of this new
venture. The businesses we have started so far have been bootstrapped, in which
we did not invest large amounts of capital. We are good at being creative and
getting things done. We are very fortunate that Tim is able to creatively solve issues associated with new and established businesses, for instance he built a basic
website for this new business (<a href=""http://www.sunshineseasons.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.sunshineseasons.com</a>) and that will save us considerable
money. </p>
<p><b>Other Ways
You Can Help</b></p>
<p>We thank you
for taking the time to read our story. It has been difficult over the past year
to stay in touch with family and friends. And we hope that this will open the
window into a view of our lives. We appreciate your love, support, well wishes
and hopefully your contribution. We would respectfully ask you to share this
with all of your friends, family and business contacts. Indiegogo provides many
tools to make sharing easy. Our family’s story can be an inspiration to many
and we thank you for sharing.</p>
<br/></div>","WHO WE ARE
We are Tim
and NiQui Chatfield, married for 29 years, parents to 5 children and business
partners for 15 years. 2015 was a rough year to say the least – starting with
selling our home of 7 years and then a stage 3-cancer diagnosis for NiQui a
week later. It took all year, all of our energy and resources to battle the cancer. We lost our land that we had planned to build our homestead on.  Now it is a new year, and we are taking
charge of our lives with the knowledge learned surviving 2015. The lesson is to be self-reliant,
accountable, and consciously seek a simpler life. We have been devastated and it is time to rebuild - and we need your help to do that.
WHAT’S THE PROBLEM and WHY SHOULD YOU
CARE?
This campaign
is to fund the start of our new business, Sunshine Seasons that offers a variety of products for people wanting to scale back their life to better enjoy living with the land. This venture is a direct result of our own journey and learning what is truly important in life. As we are at a point in our lives where personal resources are scarce but passion and determination are abundant, we WILL make this all happen - we have to. Interestingly enough there is a season for everything in life – and Spring is the best time for us to start ... coincidentally it's the best time to start this type of business! 
The physical
business located in Delaware County will offer a variety of products from the
tiniest of seeds all the way up to high-quality, Amish built tiny homes. Sunshine
Seasons has secured the property location, set up manufacturers that will
supply us with the quality products that we will be retailing (see pics in the Photo Gallery). Also,
Sunshine Seasons has set up the network of local businesses and organizations
that share our mission. Why is this important? An essential part of the vision
is to partner and educate others on the benefits of this lifestyle. The only
thing missing is the funding to bring the whole vision to life.
WE NEED YOU AS A PARTNER
Your
financial contribution is essential to making this happen. Without you it will
not get off the ground. This is a valuable project you can be a part of from
the start by helping us cross the bridge to our new, better life and business. Together
we can make a difference for Tim, Niqui and most importantly our community.
This business
will serve a much needed market in the community and it will help us generate the money to buy land again (we lost our land last year)
so that we can build our own homestead like we have been dreaming of for the
last 10 years.
What We Need & What You Get
What exactly
is this new business? Homesteading products such as:
·  Four Square Garden Kits
·  Potting Sheds
·  Tiny Homes
·  Barns
·  Chicken Coops
·  Poly Furniture
How will we
sell them? Tim has been in sales for 20 years. We have secured a lease for an
excellent location on a high-traffic highway in Central Ohio. This allows us to exhibit
a homestead experience for people who visit and shop at our retail location. We
have also set up partnerships with an Amish Building Company for the sheds,
tiny houses, chicken coops, play sets, barns, and poly furniture.
Why do we need $20,000? 
Funds will go
to the items in the order they are listed below: 
1. Fees to
comply with Township and County Building Codes: $1,000
2. Utility
set up fees  $1000
3. Lease for
Commercial Property, $1500 per month, to get started we need $4,500
4. Excavation
of the site and prep for buildings: $2,000
5. Initial Marketing:
$2,000
6. Cost of
some of the Products to display and sell: $7,500
7.
Landscaping of the site and around buildings: $2,000
Total  $20,000

The most
important aspect is to secure the excellent location, prepare the nearly 1 acre
of land and be ready to sell. Many of our partnerships are placing products at
no cost to us to display and sell. But we will need some inventory (the $7500)
to have on hand to sell right away.

The first thing that is obvious is the amount of digital data we associate with those services - photos. videos, blogs, comments, friends requests, likes etc.  What is not so obvious is how to quickly find a particular piece of digital information buried in your mountain of social media.</span><br/></p>
<p>With that in mind, we are developing the Circle of Life for your Pet.  Imagine a circular graphic representation that easily and quickly allows you to select a specific year in the life of your Pet.  Once selected, you are offered a number of options to view the various content that was pinned to that year.  </p>
<p>Upload any data to your <b>Pet-Page</b> and you will be asked if you want to pin it to the Circle of Life.  Same goes for all the other categories of digital content. Just plug in the year this event happened and it is now available. The data pinned to the selected year will be shown in a chronological manner within that year.  This allows you to quickly review everything that occurred, or was said about your Pet, in the course of that year.  No more digging around trying to figure out where a particular picture went and how to find it.  Of course, we will also support individual folders that can contain data both pinned and unpinned to your Circle of Life.</p>
<p>We are well on our way to having the architecture for this feature completed and encourage any feedback./suggestions/comments you can offer to help us make it better - after all, this is for you and your Pet!!!</p>

<div>There are many organizations around the world that provide help &amp; assistance  to the animal community.  At <b>Pages4Pets</b> we intend to embrace these groups and do all we can to help them succeed.  These groups will be urged to signup and use the features available to them within a consolidated Pet website such as <b>Pages4Pets</b>. These features can be used to expand a groups' reach into the community and enhance the good works they pursue.  From our <b>Lost &amp; Found </b>service to promoting those organizations projects, goals and needs, our intention is to unite <b>Our Heroes</b> with the animal community at large.</div>
<div>Donation links to these accredited organizations will be supported on our website. Go to their page under <b>Our Heroes</b> and you can donate directly to them - and every $$$ you donate to them - stays with them!</div>

Why?  Because the Pets we love deserve the attention...  And, we think the world is ready for a pet specific, social-media website!  Someplace we can share all the great things that make our Pets, our Pets!  
Pages4Pets is a FREE, Web-Based resource dedicated to sharing our Pet experiences with a community of like-minded Pet lovers.   We are creating an easy to use website, where anyone can post their own Pet related profile called a Pet-Page.  We encourage communication between members of the Pages4Pets community by implementing a user to user chat feature, as well as sharing informational links relative to our Pets.  A number of additional community functions and activities will be supported, including a section where accredited organizations who do good for animals, can post information about their services. All activities posted by Pages4Pets are intended to further bring the Pet community together. Sharing the chronicles of our Pet's adventures, and those special moments we spend together, will build a warmer bond between us.
On Pages4Pets, anyone can create a Pet-Page for their Pet.  Your Pet-Page can be shared with millions of people around the world and  can include pictures, videos, descriptions, comments and information about the Pets we love and cherish.  Have multiple Pets - create multiple Pet-Pages.  Is your Pet a Dog? Cat? Bird? Horse? Whatever! All Pets are important and all types of Pets are welcome on Pages4Pets! Our goal  is to provide you with the platform and tools needed to quickly and easily bring your Pet-Page together and make it something to be proud of!
Page4Pets is initially being launched in the USA, but our ultimate goal is to make it available in many countries around the world.      
Our Pets are important to us! 



Sometimes we are not sure if we are raising our Pet - or vice-versa! We do know however, that our relationship with our Pets is woven into the fabric of our everyday life.   Our Pets are considered an integral part of our family. So let's treat them like members of the family - make them Social Media Stars!
Ever spend time with your Pet and wonder what they were thinking?  We suspect you know your Pet much better than you think, and vice-versa.  On Pages4Pets you act as your Pet's personal biographer, keeping a running account of their life and adventures.  We humans are just the tool for preserving these special memories!
   What can Pages4Pets do for you and your Pet?


 

At Pages4Pets, we are on a mission to create an easy to use website that allows everyone to share their experiences involving Pets.  Sharing with others who similarly appreciate the relationship we  have with our Pets can be a fun way of expanding our connections with other Pet minded people.  As a Social Media platform for Pets, Pages4Pets will share many similarities to popular human social media platforms - except everything is about your Pet.  We will offer a feature rich environment where you can record and share all those special things about your Pet.  
Some of the features included in Pages4Pets are: 



Photos and Videos:  upload Photos and Videos of your Pet in action, or sharing a warm moment with the family.  These can also be archived in the Circle of Life feature which is described below.


Lost & Found:   is a section devoted to helping Pets and families reunite when one or the other goes missing.  Members can post special pages to this section describing their lost Pet and any pertinent information that may lead to their being reunited.   Pages can also be posted in this section describing lost Pets you may have come across in our neighborhood.


Play Date:   is a community resource where members can arrange play dates for their Pets with other members of the Pages4Pets community, or announce community gatherings involving your Pets 


Community Chat:  is a resource of the website whereby community members can exchange Pet related ideas, information and comments with
others through chat/messaging/notifications 


Best-Buds: is similar to Friends on a typical human social media site. Requests to become a Best-Bud must be accepted by the creator of the Pet-Page 


Golden Age: is devoted to issues relating to senior citizens and special needs humans, who have a special bond with their Pets.  This section supports comments and suggestions unique to seniors and service dog owners


Bravo:  is a feature that is similar to Liking something about a posting or pictures on a typical human social site  


Indiegogo Wall of Fame:   will recognize and honor the members of our community who have supported this Indiegogo funding campaign and helped to make it a success


Circle of Life: is an automated tool for creating a visual representation of the life of your Pet, and can be viewed by community members visiting your page (see more info below)


Our Search:   provides Pages4Pets members  the ability to search the Pet community by category, and that search can be factored by distance from your location


Who's Online:  presents an opportunity to see which other members of the community are currently online and available for chat  


Our Heroes:   this section feature pages describing accredited organizations who devote their time and resources in a best effort to help Pets in general, and disadvantaged Pets in particular.  Donation links directly to these qualified organizations will be featured on their page


In-Rememberance:  is devoted to our beloved Pets who have passed on to another life.  Special Pet-Pages can be created to help remember the Pets we have enjoyed throughout our lives.   Existing Pet-Pages can be moved to this section upon the passing of your Pet


Daily Blog:  is a section of your Pet-Page that serves as a diary of the daily adventures of you and your Pet  















A Little More About Lost & Found!



Have you ever had that sinking feeling when you realize your Pet is not where they are supposed to be?  All of us who have lost Pets, even for a short time, realize the anxiety and pain that this experience can bring.  



We want Pages4Pets to become THE community resource for reuniting lost Pets with their families.  We will prominently feature a section of the website called Lost & Found.  

We will encourage members of the community to post a special notice in this section when they find that their Pet is lost or missing.  Concerned community members may also post information on abandoned/found Pets they may see in their neighborhood. We would also like to solicit the help of the Pet community in making various animal shelters and support groups aware of this tool for reuniting lost Pets with their families.  We intend to provide a method by which these organizations can review posts and contact information for missing Pets in their area, as well as post Pet-Pages for newly found Pets. 

Because this is a nationwide website that can be searched by Zip Code, we will be able to help isolate the whereabouts of lost or found Pets.  If you are active with any of the animal support organizations in your area, please ask them to reach out to us so we can bring this important feature to life in the shortest possible time.







Circle of Life for my Pet?



At Pages4Pets, we have spent a great deal of time looking at features and functionality available on many of the more prominent human social media services. The first thing that is obvious is the amount of digital data we associate with those services - photos. videos, blogs, comments, friends requests, likes etc.  What is not so obvious is how to quickly find a particular piece of digital information buried in your mountain of social media.
With that in mind, we are developing the Circle of Life for your Pet.  Imagine a circular graphic representation that easily and quickly allows you to select a specific year in the life of your Pet.  Once selected, you are offered a number of options to view the various content that was pinned to that year.  
Upload any data to your Pet-Page and you will be asked if you want to pin it to the Circle of Life.  Same goes for all the other categories of digital content. Just plug in the year this event happened and it is now available. The data pinned to the selected year will be shown in a chronological manner within that year.  This allows you to quickly review everything that occurred, or was said about your Pet, in the course of that year.  No more digging around trying to figure out where a particular picture went and how to find it.  Of course, we will also support individual folders that can contain data both pinned and unpinned to your Circle of Life.
We are well on our way to having the architecture for this feature completed and encourage any feedback./suggestions/comments you can offer to help us make it better - after all, this is for you and your Pet!!!



Our Heroes!


There are many organizations around the world that provide help & assistance  to the animal community.  At Pages4Pets we intend to embrace these groups and do all we can to help them succeed.  These groups will be urged to signup and use the features available to them within a consolidated Pet website such as Pages4Pets. These features can be used to expand a groups' reach into the community and enhance the good works they pursue.  From our Lost & Found service to promoting those organizations projects, goals and needs, our intention is to unite Our Heroes with the animal community at large.
Donation links to these accredited organizations will be supported on our website. Go to their page under Our Heroes and you can donate directly to them - and every $$$ you donate to them - stays with them!


How do I sign up for a pages4pets.com account?



Pages4Pets is FREE to join and use!  You can create Pet-Pages for each of the Pets in your family.  Pages4Pets is ad supported, with tasteful ads from partners who understand our focus on Pets, and who have products that will appeal to the Pages4Pets community.   


The basic site requires a simple user account to be
created.  This process requires only the basic information seen in any account creation. 
Once a user creates a Pages4Pets account, they can browse any Pet Pages on the
site that are marked as public.  Page creators will also have the option of making their Pet Pages private, which will include a password which can be shared with others by the page creator. 
Once the user account has been created, you can create your own Pet-Pages.  Creating a Pet-Page presents the opportunity to enter information about your Pet, including photos, videos, comments and awards etc and can be assigned to the Circle of Life based on the date the event occurred.
  
Pet-Page Creation:  What Does It Take?


To create a Pet-Page, you will be directed to an online wizard that will ask you a number of questions about the Pet who is the subject of this Pet-Page.  Most of this information is optional but we urge you to share as much as you can to enhance the entire experience.  Some typical information would be:


Pet's name?

Type of Pet?

When did your Pet adopt you?


Category of Pet  (from categories)

What is your Pet's birthday (if Known)
What breed is your pet (Mutt/Purebred/Don't Know/Don't Care)
Are
there any links to articles or mentions of your pet that you would like to
share?
Was your Pet ever trained for special duty, such as a service, police or military companion?
Was your Pet a rescue?  If so, from Where?
Was your Pet purchased?  If so, from Where?
Do you want to keep a daily blog about your Pet?
Would you like to upload photos and video to your Pet-Page?
Would you like to include these pictures or videos on your Pet's Circle of Life?
Do you want your Pet-Page to be Public or Private? (enter password if private)
Does your Pet have any special skills you would
like to mention on their Pet-Page?




A special thought as we get older...


As we grow older  and retirement looms, a special void called loneliness often appears in our life.  Kids have moved on and we are often retired from our jobs leaving little in our everyday life.  
When this happens, we sometimes lack for even the simplest companionship! This void can often be filled by that special Pet, who can provide  companionship and comfort in our later years.  
Pets can be wonderful friends and we should not forget the comfort and enjoyment they can bring to us in the later years of our lives.  It's not that they supplant our human family experiences.  Rather, they are a bonus in the aging process and become our constant companions, often dedicating their entire lives to making us happy. 
We intend to support this special bond at Pages4Pets and encourage our senior community to post pictures, comments and tributes to your Pets, who work so hard to keep you happy in the later stages of our lives. 


In-Remembrance:  A Lasting Tribute to our Pets! 

Unfortunately, time has a way of fading our memories - happens to even the best of us...  Because Pets often have a much shorter lifespan than humans, we are faced with the tragic loss of our Pets more often, and it can become difficult to keep the memory of those Pets fresh in our mind.  Pages 4Pets intends to support a special section of the site called In-Remembrance.  Community members can post Pet-Pages for the Pets they have loved and  lost - Pet-Pages that are just like those for our living Pets but honored with an RIP symbol.  We also support an RIP link on the profiles of your existing Pets. In the event your Pet passes on, the existing Pet-Page can be moved to the RIP section of the site and other members of the community with whom you are connected can be notified of your loss.


Our Funding Effort:


Initial funding has been provided by the site's founders
Indiegogo Crowdfunding  campaign launches in April
Ongoing funding for the site will be ad supported
Primary ad participation from pet industry companies
Site is free to join and free to post  Pet-Pages

Direct donation links to qualified charitable Pet organizations such as adoption shelters, clinics etc will be supported 




Our Perks!

Our Perks in this campaign are offered to help us complete the construction, launch and marketing of our fully working Pages4Pets website:

We hope you will join Pages4Pets and be an active member of our community.  We want the website to be someplace that our community can have fun, meet new Pet-minded people and show off the Pets we are so proud of.  You will also be honored with a notation in our ""Indiegogo Wall of Fame"":  The website will contain a special link that is dedicated to the loyal Indiegogo contributors who have contributed to our campaign and are responsible for making it a success.





Some Perks offer one or more of the Pages4Pets community tags which can be worn by your Pet.  This shows that your Pet is a charter member of our community by displaying this logoed tag on your Pet's collar, leash or cage.  Let others in the Pet community know that you are involved and taking part in using Pages4Pets to create a social media experience for your Pet.  These tags are a great way of recognizing and interacting with other members of the Pages4Pets family.  


Other Perks offer protection against Identity theft and hacking, which has reached epidemic proportions around the world.  For some years the Credit Card Industry has been moving toward a change in the method used to store card information and personal data on credit cards.  The old magnetic stripe that has been a staple of identification information for many years, had simply outgrown its usefulness and is very vulnerable to being compromised. The new technology implemented was embedding an  radio frequency ID tag (RFID) enabled chip into the card, as a replacement for the mag stripe.  The logoed aluminum wallet we are offering  shields your chipped card and defeats the scanning devices used by the hackers. (Color may vary based on availability)


Growing our Ground Game! 

If politics has shown us anything, it is that every campaign needs a good ground game in order to be successful.  By that, we mean the local community getting together and making others aware of the benefits of backing a good cause like Pages4Pets.  We encourage our community members to become Grassroots organizers, who will reach out to others in their area to promote the benefits that Pages4Pets offers to the Pet community.  We need your help in connecting with as many Pet families as we can and appreciate all the effort you are making!  


Stay tuned after Pages4Pets launches to see our line of logoed apparel and accessories.  These will show the world that you are a supporter of our Pet community!

<h3>The World's First Personality Coach</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>Have you ever wished you were more level-headed, more focused, or more confident? While such personality changes may seem impossible, researchers at the University of Nottingham have discovered that motivated people can change their personality in just a few days with the help of a digital coach. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Based on this evidence, the research team has developed TraitMap, the world's first Personality Coach. A fully-automated device that can detect health-damaging character traits that hold you back – and deliver personalized trait-lifting activities to help you reach your full potential.</span>
</div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div><div><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">What is TraitMap's design method?</b></div><div>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">TraitMap applies a game design strategy that requires you follow one simple rule: “to exercise a personality trait outside your comfort zone at least once a day”. </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">For example, to become more extraverted, one trait-boosting challenge asks that you pretend you’re comfortable in social situations by starting a conversation with a stranger. In other words, “fake it till you make it.” </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">New thought and behaviour patterns create new brain pathways the more you exercise traits outside your comfort zone. In short, changing your personality.</span>

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Frequently Asked Questions</span><br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Who developed TraitMap?</b></p>
<p>TraitMap is the result of a global initiative, with resource support from the Division of Rehabilitation and Ageing at the University of Nottingham (UK) and the National Institute of Health Innovation (NIHI) at the University of Auckland (NZ).</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>How is TraitMap funded?</strong></p>
<p>TraitMap relies on a wide range of funding channels, including community support donations, pro bono services between the Universities of Nottingham and Auckland, and individual philanthropic donors. As preliminary data has become available on the effectiveness of TraitMap, the team has decided to seek additional funding from public and private sources.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>What type of smartphones do TraitMap support?</b></p>
<p>TraitMap is compatible with all smartphones running a BLE-enabled Android or iOS operating system.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What is the scientific evidence behind TraitMap?</b></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.traitmap.me/evidence"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">E</a><a href=""http://www.traitmap.me/evidence"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">vidence</a> shows that <a href=""http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpmc%2Farticles%2FPMC3972619%2F&amp;t=NmU1ZDAxMDNjNTY0NjM4N2RjYjVhNzQ3YTNjNzAwMDc5ZGIxMTc2NCxUbU4zdWpESg%3D%3D"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">bad habits are determined by key traits</a> and that these traits can be reversed by <a href=""http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpubmed%2F22251379&amp;t=ZTdlZGI4NzViZDliMTg5MGFkYWM3NTAwMjBmM2VlNzI0ZTcwZTYwMSxUbU4zdWpESg%3D%3D"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">targeted gaming interventions</a>.These studies have found that motivated people can not only change their personality within weeks of starting an intervention but that their trait changes remain stable after several months.</p>

<p><b>What qualifies as a TraitMap success?</b></p>
<p>You succeed when you are no longer a slave to your traits vulnerabilities. Of course you’ll feel vulnerable during a trait-boosting challenge as it will be out of your comfort zone. But you’ll break through feeling vulnerable and do the exercise anyway. You will know for yourself that trait-boosting is not a devastating event to be totally shunned at all costs but the mother of your future success. It is only your fear of failing that has hidden this ultimate truth from you.</p>
<p>Find out what counts as a <a href=""http://www.traitmap.me/success"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">success</a>.</p>
<p><b>What qualifies as a TraitMap failure?</b></p>
<p>You do absolutely nothing, and continue living your current life.</p>
<p><strong><strong><strong>What should I do if I can’t/don’t want to do a trait-boosting challenge</strong><strong>?</strong></strong></strong></p>
<p>Each daily trait-boosting challenge is a hint. Attempt it in whatever context you are currently in (making sure the exercise is out of your comfort zone) and make it happen. Don’t forget, when you attempt the trait-boosting challenge it’s important to work the exercise as much as you can because it means you courageously availed yourself to new opportunities. Failure is just part of the game too.</p>
<p><strong>Is it good for me to encourage others to share the experience?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. The Law of Attraction states that by focusing on positive or negative thoughts you bring positive or negative experiences into your life. Encouraging trait-boosting in others means you're helping them transform into the best they can be. Just remember to treat everyone with kindness and respect</p>

</div></div>","The World's First Personality Coach 
Have you ever wished you were more level-headed, more focused, or more confident? While such personality changes may seem impossible, researchers at the University of Nottingham have discovered that motivated people can change their personality in just a few days with the help of a digital coach. Based on this evidence, the research team has developed TraitMap, the world's first Personality Coach. A fully-automated device that can detect health-damaging character traits that hold you back – and deliver personalized trait-lifting activities to help you reach your full potential.
What is TraitMap's design method?
TraitMap applies a game design strategy that requires you follow one simple rule: “to exercise a personality trait outside your comfort zone at least once a day”. For example, to become more extraverted, one trait-boosting challenge asks that you pretend you’re comfortable in social situations by starting a conversation with a stranger. In other words, “fake it till you make it.” New thought and behaviour patterns create new brain pathways the more you exercise traits outside your comfort zone. In short, changing your personality.


What are the goals of TraitMap?
a) To raise your awareness of how bad traits control and restrict your lifeb) To transform restrictive personality traits into ones that empower youc) To avoid perfection and permit failure – it’s part of the game!d) To take pleasure and learn from each TraitMap challenge

The secret to TraitMap's success is its unique 5-step gameplay:



Trait-coaching ""modules"" inform you of optimal trait goals


Trait-tracking ""goals"" raise awareness of your positive changes over time


Trait-lifting “challenges” turn bad traits into ones that empower you


Trait-gifting ""rewards"" keep you motivated to stay on track


Trait-sharing “stories"" help others toward positive change










The responsiveness of TraitMap is the result of our ETHOS™ Technology which combines a novel algorithm with data feedback from five sensors – microphone, accelerometer, motion sensor, touch display, and video camera. Passively detecting personality traits that hold you back – and delivering tailored activities in order to change and grow them. Resulting in positive life improvements that stabilize over the long-term.




   

How Does TraitMap Work?










Frequently Asked Questions



Who developed TraitMap?
TraitMap is the result of a global initiative, with resource support from the Division of Rehabilitation and Ageing at the University of Nottingham (UK) and the National Institute of Health Innovation (NIHI) at the University of Auckland (NZ).

How is TraitMap funded?
TraitMap relies on a wide range of funding channels, including community support donations, pro bono services between the Universities of Nottingham and Auckland, and individual philanthropic donors. As preliminary data has become available on the effectiveness of TraitMap, the team has decided to seek additional funding from public and private sources.
What type of smartphones do TraitMap support?
TraitMap is compatible with all smartphones running a BLE-enabled Android or iOS operating system.

What is the scientific evidence behind TraitMap?
Evidence shows that bad habits are determined by key traits and that these traits can be reversed by targeted gaming interventions.These studies have found that motivated people can not only change their personality within weeks of starting an intervention but that their trait changes remain stable after several months.



What qualifies as a TraitMap success?
You succeed when you are no longer a slave to your traits vulnerabilities. Of course you’ll feel vulnerable during a trait-boosting challenge as it will be out of your comfort zone. But you’ll break through feeling vulnerable and do the exercise anyway. You will know for yourself that trait-boosting is not a devastating event to be totally shunned at all costs but the mother of your future success. It is only your fear of failing that has hidden this ultimate truth from you.
Find out what counts as a success.
What qualifies as a TraitMap failure?
You do absolutely nothing, and continue living your current life.
What should I do if I can’t/don’t want to do a trait-boosting challenge?
Each daily trait-boosting challenge is a hint. Attempt it in whatever context you are currently in (making sure the exercise is out of your comfort zone) and make it happen. Don’t forget, when you attempt the trait-boosting challenge it’s important to work the exercise as much as you can because it means you courageously availed yourself to new opportunities. Failure is just part of the game too.
Is it good for me to encourage others to share the experience?
Yes. The Law of Attraction states that by focusing on positive or negative thoughts you bring positive or negative experiences into your life. Encouraging trait-boosting in others means you're helping them transform into the best they can be. Just remember to treat everyone with kindness and respect

</div></div>","Our Story
Kopa Leo is a peer lending business operating virtually through an App on Android store making  invitation to
people who need to borrow and others to lend. Our aim was to
match borrowing needs of our clients with available financial
resources invested by Grand peers with us. 
The idea was born out of the conventional lending practices where clientelle  visit a shop or a grocery store and request for credit terms. As opposed to the
conventional method of Credit terms where the clients receive the
goods, a record is made on a book and the proprietor waits for the
client to pay on an agreed date, Kopa leo
started offering small loans to its clients, who would eventually
make their intended purchases from its own shop outlet and possibly also make
other purchases elsewhere with the change.



This
lending model was very successful since it neither limited clients to
making purchases from Kopa leo outlet nor make purchases for the goods we
stock alone.
Most of our borrowing requests are to cover basic necessities like food, clothing, shelter, education and medical needs.

<h2>A Quick Summary<br/>
</h2>
<p>A cup of coffee on average in the U.S. costs about $3 which in the global market can buy a pound of unroasted coffee beans. Nevertheless, the farmers do not receive adequate benefit from the transaction.</p>
<p>It is known that more than 500 million people around the world depend on coffee for their livelihood while 25 million of them are coffee farmers. Moreover, women represent the majority of the coffee farmers around the world, and they often experience additional challenges as they struggle with gender inequality. It is also reported that the 70% of the world’s poor are women and they face more difficulty accessing resources compared to men in general.</p>
<p>We want to <b>revolutionize the coffee industry with our storytelling subscription based model to bridge the gap between coffee consumers of the global North and coffee producers of the global South,</b> and also work towards more just and equal world for everyone regardless of their gender or class.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Background<br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>From our interactions with coffee farmers from Costa Rica and Nepal, we were made aware that often the small-scale coffee farmers are unable to sustain their farming as the sales of coffee do not guarantee that their cost of production is paid for.</p>
<p>Additionally, the sobering fact is that lack of market facilitation directly results in low or stunted economic growth in communities. This inevitably results in social problems such as illiteracy and depreciating health care. Small scale farmers in these areas have minimal resources, making it impossible to expand their businesses outside of local communities, and/or leading them to leave their native community behind to migrate to the city in search of job opportunities.</p>While many farming communities in Costa Rica have women’s associations, our interaction with them has informed us that they lack financial and societal support. The lack of support for women in leadership roles in the coffee farming communities has presented additional challenges for increasing women's  leadership in the community and their ability to flourish in those roles.<p></p>

<h2>The Impact</h2>

Our direct trade with farmers will ensure a sustainable source of income for the farmers, that it has real potential to restore balance, and to be a bridge to participation in larger economies.

Moreover, farmers tell us that coffee is a potentially valuable and sustainable source of income. Our intention is to connect the rural coffee farmers in these countries with the coffee lovers around the world through stories, and use the profit to address the issues that they raise in their region. We are not only helping the farmers establish a sustainable source of income but we are also creating social-awareness and appreciation for coffee.<p></p>

<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>The potential risks that we have identified for our social venture are related to both the customer segments and local communities that we are impacting. Our customer segment includes young professionals, and college students. With regards to them, we realize that we need to create specific and attractive packaging to create a vicarious experience for our customer. The specialty coffee business, as we realize, is quite competitive, and requires us to stand out for the customers. We hope to achieve this through creative marketing, and subscription based storytelling model, and one-to-one customer relations. Additionally, our model that focus solely on subscriptions and stories of the women coffee farmers is rare to non-existent. We see a great value in working with female farmers granting them the opportunity to become financially independent. Having recognized these risks, we also understand that social ventures require time and creativity in solving many of these issues.

My destiny was formed. In 2015 my lovely wife and I made Independence, CA, our home, (part-time) where I began to hone my craft as a coffee roaster. Soon my new hobby developed into a vehicle to promote the awesomeness of the Owens Valley. I named the roasting company after the town of Independence, a hub and restocking location for hikers along the Pacific Crest  and John Muir Trail, and each roast was named after a specific destination or location in Inyo County.  I then packed and hand stamped each bag thinking I would only sell a few bags a month. Not the case! Sales rapidly grew and to date production has become overwhelming to keep up with demand.  After months of researching commercial roasters, I was led to The San Franciscan Roasters, family owned and manufactured in Carson City, NV. The San Franciscan SF-6 is “primarily designed as a manual artisan roaster for the craftsman”.  (That's me!)  I’ve had the honor to roast on one and loved it!  (Thanks to Richard at Cafe Santana, Oakland, CA). Scouring the classifieds and calling upon coffee houses in search of a used San Franciscan roaster was to no avail. Not to mention the small business loans, grants, grants for women, grants for start ups, grants for underdogs, etc. brought me to the conclusion that most small business owners face; We don't qualify.  In January 2016, I emptied my savings and borrowed what I needed for a deposit on a commercial roaster.  Today I'm asking for your help in contributing to my new roaster campaign so that I may continue to create a coffee oasis in the majestic Owens Valley.   For your viewing pleasure, please check out all the videos I've created. With gratitude, GunnerIndy Coffee Roasting Company",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

We thought it was a dream come true. We went from bad to an amazingly beautiful space in a great area to what we thought was a welcoming landlord. Sadly, our dream has turned into a nightmare. <br/><br/>We moved in and began pouring money into this new location to renovate and make it Infinity ready. But there were issues with the heating (not again). When we told the landlord he came out and saw our poles. The landlord went from super helpful to wanting to find anyway to get us out immediately due to his personal beliefs and him thinking what we do is wrong and dirty. We'd been honest about our studio and love of both fabric and metal but it seems maybe his realtor left out our love of chrome. <br/><br/>We tried and tried to get him to fix the heating issues but to no avail. A lawyer had to be called in and we brought in our own heating guy. What we found out was that there are major code violations. But still the landlord hasn't been willing to fix his mistakes. So we called the city. While there were violations on the landlords part it seems the landlord wasn't so honest about what needed to be done to remove the drop ceiling. We were told only he had to approve it, not that we had to get a permit, not that we had to immediately have the sprinkler system brought up to ceiling height. <br/><br/>So now here we are, cited for the sprinklers that we have to bring up to code but also with other fire code violations that the landlord wont fix. What that means is we can't teach in what was supposed to be our beautiful new home until everything is fixed. With a landlord that doesn't want us there and unwilling to take care of his part we've got no choice but to move yet again. But, after putting so much money into moving already and loosing out on all of it we just don't have the cash in hand to move. <br/><br/>That's why we need all of you. We love this studio which is more than a studio, it's our family. Losing it is not an option. It's been growing since 2007 and there's no intention to stop that growth because that would mean losing this family of amazing people too. This has turned into a nightmare but we have a realtor working overtime with lots of options to get us moved into a better home. We just need the funds to make it happen. Any help we get would mean the world to us. Teaching is our life and passion and there's nothing else in the world we want to do more than continue helping all our amazing students grow and become better and stronger.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>UPDATE: just when we thought things couldn't get worse as we were clearing out the studio yesterday to make it fire safe until repairs are done Tuesday that we are paying for we get served eviction papers. Our ""wonderful"" landlord is claiming he never got rent this month. Funny because our attorney handed the check to him personally and got receipt. This landlord has made it abundantly clear he doesn't want us there and we're taking care of repairs we shouldn't have to just to make the space useable while our realtor secures our new location. All we want to do is teach our students </p></div>","As most everyone knows we recently moved from our old location that was in a not so great area with heating issues to a new location.

What that means is we can't teach in what was supposed to be our beautiful new home until everything is fixed. With a landlord that doesn't want us there and unwilling to take care of his part we've got no choice but to move yet again. But, after putting so much money into moving already and loosing out on all of it we just don't have the cash in hand to move. That's why we need all of you. We love this studio which is more than a studio, it's our family. Losing it is not an option. It's been growing since 2007 and there's no intention to stop that growth because that would mean losing this family of amazing people too. This has turned into a nightmare but we have a realtor working overtime with lots of options to get us moved into a better home. We just need the funds to make it happen. Any help we get would mean the world to us. Teaching is our life and passion and there's nothing else in the world we want to do more than continue helping all our amazing students grow and become better and stronger.UPDATE: just when we thought things couldn't get worse as we were clearing out the studio yesterday to make it fire safe until repairs are done Tuesday that we are paying for we get served eviction papers. Our ""wonderful"" landlord is claiming he never got rent this month. Funny because our attorney handed the check to him personally and got receipt. This landlord has made it abundantly clear he doesn't want us there and we're taking care of repairs we shouldn't have to just to make the space useable while our realtor secures our new location. All we want to do is teach our students",0.0,0,"1 Campaign
