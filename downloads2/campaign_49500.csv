<h3>Who is Katelin Maylum?</h3>
<p>My name is Katelin Maylum and I have been writing, acting, producing and directing for over ten years now. I attended Wayne State University and received my BA in Theater with a Specialization in Performance in 2015. I have been honored to receive several awards and nominations for my work throughout the years, most notably the Tompkins Award from Wayne State University's Department of English for ""The Front Lines"", a play later to be the basis for the Detroit Filmmaker Awards nominated feature film, ""Stay"". I am asking for your support for my newest and third feature film, ""Jennifer's Counsel"", a comedy.</p>
<h3>What is ""Jennifer's Counsel""?</h3>
<p>""Jennifer's Counsel"" is about four lawyers on a mission to find their missing paralegal, Jennifer. Their adventure takes them to a strip club, the north side of Flint and to an epic fight to the death! It's definitely a comedy with some edge to it as it deals with race and racial tensions, but we feel that this film is a great story to be told and that it is a fun and hilarious ride from beginning to end! It truly has something for everyone - romance, comedy, a pinch of drama, fight scenes, guns and beautiful women!</p>
<p>We believe that JC has the chance to be our big breakout film, but we have to have the funds, equipment and support to do it big like we dream of. We want to be able to enter film festivals, have an amazing premiere, and show everyone all the talent that Michigan has to offer, <u><strong>but we absolutely need your help!</strong></u></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need funding for equipment, craft services, compensation for crew and cast positions, location fees and whatever else we might run into along the way on this crazy filmmaking journey. We have a lofty goal of $2,000, but any amount helps!</p>
<p>We will be offering some cool swag for donations, such as: Angry Macey Films DVDs, hand written thank you notes with Hershey Kisses, Special Thanks credits, Facebook shout outs, cameos and more!</p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal, we will use all funds raised to help support the film, whether it be for a few meals on set, a gas card for a cast member, or some batteries.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is important because we have been on a mission since the beginning to try and expose the world to the amazing talent that Michigan has to offer. We see incredibly talented individuals doing awesome work all of the time, but they simply don't have the funds to get onto a bigger platform. We want to change that. We want to make so much on this fundraiser that we can not only <strong>PAY </strong>cast <strong>AND</strong> crew, but we can make a beautiful professional product that can compete with the best of them, and put money into the pockets of Flint residents.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Being a filmmaker, I have seen some pretty crazy things over the years with several short films under my belt and three feature films. Not only that, I have been acting professionally since I was 12 years old. Sometimes, things don't work out. Some examples of things not working out in the past: the lead completely disappears from the face of the earth before we are done filming, we are no longer allowed to use the same location that we've been using, the location is a last minute cancellation - no call, no show with the owner, or everyone is just incredibly late to set and we only have an hour or so to shoot. I've dealt with it all, and I've still been able to pull it altogether to create a beautiful work of art. With a little bit of rewriting, re-figuring and determination, there isn't much that has gotten in my way of creating a successful project. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We can always accept in kind donations of film equipment, batteries, food/snacks or just spreading the word! We also need some dedicated crew members, so if that's something you're interested in, let us know! </p>

<p> <strong>EMILY CLASSEN</strong> - Plays <b><i>“Vanessa Taylor”  </i></b>in the film Smack. </p>
<p>Emily Classen is clever enough to begin her bio with big credits, so watch her in a lead role in “The Forgiving” on Amazon Prime Video (Marketing for Change, Co). Emily is currently based in Baltimore but is originally from New Orleans, and she can’t go back now because then being southern wouldn’t be interesting. Since moving to the DMV area, she’s put her acting degree from the University of Southern Mississippi to good use in both film and theatre. Local stage credits run the gamut from original musicals (Baltimore Rock Opera Society) to the classics (Baltimore Shakespeare Factory). Her film work includes “Ape Canyon” (Mind in Motion Productions) and the tv series “Thespian” (Hold for Scooter Films). She plans to grow her film career in both comedy and drama. Emily was drawn to the impactful story of “Smack,” and she hopes to bring honesty to the romance and grit housing the story’s message. In addition to “Smack,” Emily’s upcoming projects include the feature film “WNUf Halloween Sequel,” produced by Chris and Melissa LaMartina. EmilyClassen.com</p>
<p><i><strong>What intrigued you about ""Smack?""</strong></i></p>
<p>Films are often the most impactful when they show us things that aren’t pretty. I was drawn to Smack because it explores the full extent of what addiction can do to lives. The script doesn’t shy away from ugliness, and I think that’s what makes it so powerful, because the issue itself is ugly. The slippery slope of addiction is something that almost everyone has a story about, so I think that we as storytellers need to traverse that terrain. I hope that we can help facilitate conversation with this project. </p>

She is currently a Washington, DC based actress/performer and has appeared in music videos, commercials, and performed with different dance troupes throughout the DC area. </p>
<p>Alice made her TV debut on Investigation Discovery’s “Southern Fried Homicide” playing a Polo player’s ex-girlfriend. She continued work on several other Investigation Discovery shows and landed a lead on “Deadly Affairs” as Jennifer Pammer. One of her most esteemed roles, however, was a Campaign Staffer in the Netflix original series “House of Cards” where she had the privilege of doing a scene with actress Robin Wright. </p>
<p>She later got involved with a unique SAG-AFTRA web-series called “Cecilie La Rue: Vampire Hunter” playing a lead as the Vampire Hunter named Edith Sorenson. Alice went on to land another lead as Katrina in the thrilling film “VOORHEES: A Friday the 13th Fan Film,” which has now hit over 1 MILLION VIEWS! She is currently in the principal photography stage of “The Haddonfield Nightmare: A Halloween Fan Film” in a supporting role as Vanessa Cooper, Lauren Tate’s best friend, and post-production stage of “The Dark Office,” where she played Vickie, a pothead and supernatural enthusiast. </p>
<p>Although Alice is usually in front of the camera, SMACK will be her debut as a Director, allowing her to utilize and hone other facets of hers. She believes that to fully understand and appreciate what it takes to produce an impactful film, it is important to experience and develop in all aspects of the creative process.</p>
<p><i><strong>What intrigued you about ""Smack?""</strong></i></p>

<p>Come completion of the film, the Wet Paint Pictures Team is diving head on into the film festival circuit. We believe our story and our team have something truly special here. A portion of the funds will be put aside for submission fees. We have high hopes for possibly getting selected!</p>
<p>That being said, we do want to be fully transparent with our amazing backers. One of the major conditions of many festivals is the prohibition of a public theatrical exhibition (including online release). Therefore, the film cannot be viewed by the general public prior to submission or it may be automatically disqualified or deemed ineligible for award consideration. Consequently, this will cause a minor delay on some rewards, such as Blu-Rays and Screenplays. We do not want this to be a deterrent, but rather a testament to our dedication, passion, and importance of the film’s message. We hope you understand this requirement and believe in our journey!</p>

KATHY SANDERS - Plays ""Robin Taylor""  in the film Smack.
Kathy is an actress and associate producer who loves bringing great stories to life. Her resume includes several films streaming on Amazon Prime, an award-winning web series, tv appearances and numerous commercial & print jobs.She also enjoys working as a film festival judge and a casting assistant.
What intrigued you about ""Smack?""
""Addiction is a dark & ugly beast that destroys everything in its path which is why I was so drawn to Smack's raw depiction of this truth.  Cody's passion for the project is palpable and I'm so grateful to be a part of his vision and desire to bring awareness.""

BRIAN LYONS-BURKE - Plays ""Jim Ross"" in the film Smack.
Brian Lyons-Burke  is a Washington DC stage, film and voiceover actor. He is a two time a WATCH award winner for his portrayal of Judge Turpin in Sweeney Todd and Roger DeBris in The Producers.  Upcoming films include the short films “Three Clicks” and “Departure”.
What intrigued you about ""Smack?""
""I was attracted to this project by the commitment and passion of the film-makers, and the power of the script.  This is a serious film, dealing with a serious issue, and the role of Jim Ross will provide a challenge that I look forward to.""

JORDAN MILLER - Jordan Miller is an award-winning writer, director and musician from Maryland.  His first feature, ""The Red Effect"" (now streaming on Tubi TV), was released in early 2017 to praise and awards from both the Queens World Film Festival and the San Francisco Black Film Festival. Jordan's most recent film, a horror short entitled ""Three"", won various festival awards in 2018 with a subsequent release on popular horror web platform, Crypt TV. He has also directed many music videos across genres and is currently working on completing feature length horror anthology film ""The Black Hills Night Hike"".
What intrigued you about ""Smack?""
""My natural gravitation towards dark storytelling is what drew me to this story initially. That, and the entire addiction aspect. I have seen family and friends fight that fight and in some sad cases lose that battle.""

ALICE BOZGA - Alice C. Bozga was born in Oradea, Romania, part of the region known as Transylvania, and moved to the US with her family as a child. She attended The Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute in New York City as a teen and later graduated college with an AA Degree focused in Performing Arts. She is currently a Washington, DC based actress/performer and has appeared in music videos, commercials, and performed with different dance troupes throughout the DC area. 
Alice made her TV debut on Investigation Discovery’s “Southern Fried Homicide” playing a Polo player’s ex-girlfriend. She continued work on several other Investigation Discovery shows and landed a lead on “Deadly Affairs” as Jennifer Pammer. One of her most esteemed roles, however, was a Campaign Staffer in the Netflix original series “House of Cards” where she had the privilege of doing a scene with actress Robin Wright. 
She later got involved with a unique SAG-AFTRA web-series called “Cecilie La Rue: Vampire Hunter” playing a lead as the Vampire Hunter named Edith Sorenson. Alice went on to land another lead as Katrina in the thrilling film “VOORHEES: A Friday the 13th Fan Film,” which has now hit over 1 MILLION VIEWS! She is currently in the principal photography stage of “The Haddonfield Nightmare: A Halloween Fan Film” in a supporting role as Vanessa Cooper, Lauren Tate’s best friend, and post-production stage of “The Dark Office,” where she played Vickie, a pothead and supernatural enthusiast. 
Although Alice is usually in front of the camera, SMACK will be her debut as a Director, allowing her to utilize and hone other facets of hers. She believes that to fully understand and appreciate what it takes to produce an impactful film, it is important to experience and develop in all aspects of the creative process.
What intrigued you about ""Smack?""
“SMACK is a gritty, realistic take on the struggles and destruction of drug addiction. Although a romantic drama, it won't be shying away from the painful truth, that sometimes love is not enough.”

CODY FAULK - “We hope you all can support this project and help us bring this vision to life. It’s more than just making a movie, it’s about spreading awareness. This film is deeply personal for me and for many others around the world. It’s a real topic that needs to be talked about MORE. Help be a voice for the voiceless.​ If we can save just ONE life. Then we made a good movie.”

Our goal with this campaign is to raise $15,000 in order to afford the cost of Principal Photography and Post-Production for the film. 

All funds designated for production will go towards film permits, insurance, gear and vehicle rentals, stunts, special FX & make up,  post-production services and other items that are essential in running a safe and productive film set. This funding will allow our production crew to film with the proper Camera and Lighting Equipment, Special-FX Make-Up, Costumes, Props, Food, and several other Post-Production costs such as Editing, Sound Design, Sound and Music Mixing, Color Grading, Marketing, Festival fees, and of course, great Perks for our backers!

GOING BIG!


Come completion of the film, the Wet Paint Pictures Team is diving head on into the film festival circuit. We believe our story and our team have something truly special here. A portion of the funds will be put aside for submission fees. We have high hopes for possibly getting selected!
That being said, we do want to be fully transparent with our amazing backers. One of the major conditions of many festivals is the prohibition of a public theatrical exhibition (including online release). Therefore, the film cannot be viewed by the general public prior to submission or it may be automatically disqualified or deemed ineligible for award consideration. Consequently, this will cause a minor delay on some rewards, such as Blu-Rays and Screenplays. We do not want this to be a deterrent, but rather a testament to our dedication, passion, and importance of the film’s message. We hope you understand this requirement and believe in our journey!
Thank you all for your support, we cannot do this without YOU!

Thank you for taking the time to look over our campaign and know that we are greatly appreciative for any support you can give. After making your contribution, we simply ask that you please share this campaign with friends or family you believe will enjoy this film.
Thank you again for your continued support of independent films. It means the world!",22.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>""Rico"" Documentary Film</h3>
<h3>Fundraising Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>At 90 years of age, watercolourist Richard Demarco CBE is recognised as Scotland’s leading promoter of all the arts. For almost 60 years, he has invited 1000s of artists to participate in the Edinburgh Festival and subsequently brought global recognition to some of the 20th century's biggest names in contemporary art; Joseph Beuys, Tadeusz Kantor and Paul Neagu among them. </strong></p>
<p>However, as the global pandemic halts exhibitions (Richard's only source of income), and with the current home to his archive in complete disrepair, Demarco now faces eviction by Edinburgh City Council. Out-of-favour because he dares to confront the folly of the modern art world,  <strong>“Rico”</strong> (his mother's nickname for him) believes he’s in a race against time to find a permanent home for his “<strong>shrine to the Edinburgh Festival”</strong> - or risk losing it upon his death to those who <strong>“have commodified the visual art world.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Emmy and Golden Globe winner Brian Cox joins luminaries in contemporary art such as Marina Abramovic and Sir Nicolas Serota, alongside some of Richard's dearest friends, embarking  on a journey through the incredible Demarco Archive and learning more about this remarkable man...""The last great titan of Scottish art!""</strong></p>
<p>Award-winning filmmaker Dr Marco Federici has directed, produced and edited the film, using personal footage from over 2 decades of filming Richard, as well as precious materials digitised from the Demarco archive.  This is a story of how a man born from hardworking Italo Scottish immigrants, overcame the odds to become one of the nation's most important living figures in art...yet has lived in penury for the last thirty years and is on the verge of losing his life's work. This Indiegogo campaign is an attempt to raise funds to complete the post-production and fund entry to the worlds biggest film festivals, bringing Richard's story to the attention of a global audience.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need to raise £20,000 to complete cinema-standard post-production and market the film to prestigious festivals including Sundance, Tribeca, Venice and Berlin.</li>
<li>The post-production will include colour-grading, sound mixing, visual effects work from Scotland's most professional facilities, culminating in the final delivery of a feature-length film for cinema, streaming and televisual broadcast. Currently, the duration is 99mins.</li>
<li>In return for your contributions, there are a series of exciting ""perks"" available, including signed prints from Richard Demarco, DVD's and of course perpetual credits in the final film.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Richard's life story is incredible however, he is arguably more celebrated and recognised in Poland, Germany, Romania and Italy than in his native Scotland. The documentary aims to tell for the first time on film the high-points and controversies of his career, and the distress of his current plight. The film will introduce him to a new global audience and it is hoped, attract the interest of academic institutions who may wish to learn more about the Demarco Archive.</p>
<p>Richard Demarco has arguably been an unpaid diplomat for Scotland, building bridges between alienated nations in Europe where others turned their backs, and as a result, he has discovered some of the most important contemporary artists of the late 20th century.</p>
<p><strong>Filmmaker Marco Federici is a long-established producer and filmmaker for Scottish Television and BBC Scotland.

<h3>About Project H</h3>
<p>In 2014, filmmakers Aaron Toney, Jason Sweat, and Linda Jewell set out to create an original film IP entitled “Throne”.</p>
<p>Collectively cumulating in over four decades in stunts, acting, writing, and producing, their partnership bolstered the success of “Throne” and its amazing following. With fans and friends asking for more content, it was clear that “Throne” had created a steady fandom.</p>
<p>Adding Co-Producer, Julia Maggio, and a more direct vision, Halvon Corp. Entertainment and Global Forge Studios was created to pool assets together and develop the expansive world of “Throne”. </p>
<p>This campaign is to crowdfund for the pilot episode of the series.</p>
<p>Project H is not just some spur of the moment concept thought up over night. This world, its lore, and it’s characters have been passionately refined over the course of YEARS! And each member of this team believes in this material!</p>

<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Project H is a full budget production. Although we are efficiently and effectively using our resources (financial and otherwise), in accordance with our budget, we needed to create a crowdfunding campaign. The financial resources acquired through a successful campaign will be used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fulfill the contracts of our amazing cast and production crews</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! We are fundraising to make a short film that aims to raise dementia awareness. Our SAG film, ""27 Candles,"" follows a grandfather and granddaughter over 25 years as they struggle to make memories before dementia takes its toll. The story highlights identity, family, and the importance of making a memory. The screenplay has placed in five festivals to date, and we have pulled together an all-star cast and crew to make this come to life! Our cast members (including Michael Potts, Sofia Bryant, and Alysha Deslorieux) have starred in Netflix,  HBO, and Broadway shows; our cinematographers (Peter Pasacucci &amp; Nikita Carpenter) have created work for Grammy and Emmy winners; and our director (Naaji Adzimah) has worked alongside Emmy winners and Academy Award nominees. We are working to make a film of the utmost quality to increase viewership to spread our message far and wide. With that mission comes the high cost of top quality equipment, shooting in quality locations, meeting new and expensive COVID requirements to keep everyone safe, and continuing to hire (and feed!) an amazing team. Please support our vision coming to fruition, and putting the spotlight on an illness that afflicts 50 million people, and affects the millions more that care for them. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to increase opportunities for distribution, enhanced viewership, and reach of our message, we are making a high caliber film. We can make a top-notch film for $49,336 - that would cover costs throughout pre-production, filming for a week, editing, through submissions for film festival screenings (our path to eventual distribution). The highest costs of our project are professional-grade camera and lighting equipment, rental fees for our various locations, compensation for our team, entry to film festivals, and costs associated to COVID protections. SAG now requires everyone involved to be rapid tested every three days, to have a COVID Compliance Officer on set, have PPE (masks, gloves, etc.) available to all, and to have all locations thoroughly sanitized and prepped. These COVID-prevention-related costs have demanded a sharp increase in our budget, but it is absolutely necessary to keep our team safe. </p>
<p>In exchange for your support, we can offer producer titles in our credits and on IMDB, signed photos, invitations to the cast/crew screenings, exclusive behind the scenes footage, and more.</p>
<p>If you are interested in supporting us in exchange for a tax benefit, please email naajisky@gmail.com for information on how to donate through our 501(c)(3) non-profit fiscal sponsor.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Every cent truly matters in helping us to make a quality film! We really appreciate any contributions in assisting us to carry our message forth.  The director's last film on mental illness, ""Postal,"" has been an official selection of 16 film festivals, has played for and educated thousands on schizophrenia, and sparked numerous discussions on how we can better care for our mentally ill neighbors. We want this film to have even broader reach, with the aim to have it viewable on popular streaming platforms to continue to educate and raise awareness about an illness with an astounding 10 million new cases annually.</p>

<p>Hello, fellow horror fans or curious individuals! We are Deranged Minds Entertainment, a self-founded independent production company run by two insanely passionate horror fan and film buffs. We wrote, produced, and landed distribution across America on our first film ""Red Eye"" when we were 18 years old. Now, we're 22 and on post-production for our second feature film, ""Inverted"". That's the one you're probably curious about, so here is a short summary of our newest film below.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Set in the '70s, an off-the-grid satanic cult known as the ""Inverts"" kidnap four individuals to recruit for the holy war against the second coming of Christ. A lesbian hippie, drug-addicted prostitute, a man in drag, and a pedophile priest fight to survive through various initiations that push past the most brutal of boundaries. ""Inverted"" is a satanic slay-fest that is sure to satisfy even the most hardcore horror fans appetite. If ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""The Lord's of Salem"" had a 70's acid baby, it would be ""Inverted"".</p>

<p>Here's the breakdown, folks! We launched this campaign to give anyone one last chance to preorder ""Inverted"" in its glorious uncut, limited, hand-numbered and autographed edition.

<p>Admittedly, £5,000 seems like a lot of money to the normal person. However, in regards to filmmaking, it is considered somewhat of a micro-budget. We need your help in order to fund various different aspects of production, such as: </p>
<ul>
<li>Securing the various locations needed for the film</li>
<li>Hiring sufficient lighting equipment</li>
<li>Feeding our cast and crew</li>
<li>Transport costs for our cast, crew and equipment</li>
<li>Film Festival submissions<br/> </li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1600089215/makngs92vjm6eedv0zdo.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><br/>We have high aspirations for the film, from screening in prestigious film festivals around the world to receiving official distribution ready for its public release. Your contributions and involvement with our project is crucial for us to make <i>Kate &amp; Jake</i> a reality, and even sharing our campaign with others who may be able to help can drive this production in the right direction.</p>
<p>A visual breakdown of our budget is laid out below for you to see what your support would be going towards...</p>

<p>If we fail to reach our intended goal of £5,000, <u><strong>we will still create the film</strong></u>. No question. It is definitely happening. This is a story that our creative team are determined to tell the world, however, our backs will be up against the wall and production will be much more difficult - that's why every single donation is crucial to the quality of the final product. Our cast and crew are already working for free, so the first element that will take a hit is our budget allowance for film festival submissions. This may result in us setting up a seperate Indiegogo campaign AFTER we have wrapped up on filming.</p>
<p>On the flip side, if we manage to <u>SURPASS</u> our £5,000 target, then we can begin to actually pay our cast and crew for their hard work on the project - which would be lovely. </p>
<p>Please make sure to check out all of the available perks on offer, there are loads of great ways to get involved with the project and support us!</p>

COVID-19 has the potential to derail this, depending on if it escalates again throughout December and forces us to shut down production. If this is the case, it will simply result in a <u>delay</u> of the film and we can confirm that the film will still head into production as soon as it is deemed safe to do so.</p>
<p>As discussed further above, we will also be filming <i>Kate &amp; Jake</i> regardless of whether or not we meet the £5,000 target goal. Unlike a Sci-Fi or Western genre film, we don't have the challenge of elaborate costume and/or set design. Our story is grounded in drama, and therefore we have the upperhand in telling the story either way. The noticeable only difference will be in our production value - which we obviously would prefer to be as professional as possible.</p>

</div></div>","After being separated for three months, Kate calls up Jake to ask if they can meet. She has some news that is exciting, yet devastating. The meeting prompts the pair to reminisce, exploring what happened to their relationship...
Kate & Jake is a truthful, hard-hitting yet funny tale of adolescent love and working class hardships, exploring the themes of guilt, loss and dreams within the city of Liverpool, England.
 

 


 
Admittedly, £5,000 seems like a lot of money to the normal person. However, in regards to filmmaking, it is considered somewhat of a micro-budget. We need your help in order to fund various different aspects of production, such as: 

Securing the various locations needed for the film
Hiring sufficient lighting equipment
Feeding our cast and crew
Transport costs for our cast, crew and equipment
Film Festival submissions 


We have high aspirations for the film, from screening in prestigious film festivals around the world to receiving official distribution ready for its public release. Your contributions and involvement with our project is crucial for us to make Kate & Jake a reality, and even sharing our campaign with others who may be able to help can drive this production in the right direction.
A visual breakdown of our budget is laid out below for you to see what your support would be going towards...
 

 
If we fail to reach our intended goal of £5,000, we will still create the film. No question. It is definitely happening. This is a story that our creative team are determined to tell the world, however, our backs will be up against the wall and production will be much more difficult - that's why every single donation is crucial to the quality of the final product. Our cast and crew are already working for free, so the first element that will take a hit is our budget allowance for film festival submissions. This may result in us setting up a seperate Indiegogo campaign AFTER we have wrapped up on filming.
On the flip side, if we manage to SURPASS our £5,000 target, then we can begin to actually pay our cast and crew for their hard work on the project - which would be lovely. 
Please make sure to check out all of the available perks on offer, there are loads of great ways to get involved with the project and support us!

<h3>Our film, <i>A City Within a City</i>, tells historical and contemporary stories of Black men and women in Grand Rapids, Michigan struggling for freedom, equality, and justice.</h3>
<p>We explore these stories through the lens of Dr. Todd Robinson's concept of ""managerial racism"" from his book of the same title. It's the polite, covert tactics that limit the progress of Black citizens while creating the impression of forward movement in a progressive, justice-minded environment.</p>
<p>We started this journey two years ago encapsulated in this book that, as Black Grand Rapidians, we felt had shined a light on a dark history that was hidden. We wanted to find a way to bring the stories from the book to more people, since most people don't read academic dissertations! So the best way for us to get the contents of the book to the masses, especially young people, was to put it in a film. With your help!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This film will be distributed across the country to help other communities where managerial racism is rampant. It will equip all who care about their city and want it to be healthier by providing examples of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resistance to gatekeeping</li>
<li>Overcoming roadblocks</li>
<li>Identifying managerial racism as it shapeshifts</li>
<li>Debating strategies of Black excellence vs. accommodation</li>
<li>White allyship</li>
</ul>
<p>And this is just the beginning. The apprentices we place to learn major film crew roles will be the pioneers for our 501c3 incubator program, <strong>Grand Rapids Media Initiative &amp; Film Incubator</strong>.

In the spirit of his work, we bring you the story of the subversion of Bolivian democracy, culminating in a deadly coup and the massacre of dozens of poor and indigenous protesters.
Discover how Bolivia's self-proclaimed democratic revolution has lifted up poor and working people—and provoked the ire of foreign and domestic elites

Learn how the United States has interfered in Bolivia's politics for decades, going back to the George W. Bush administration and the anticipated assassination of Evo Morales
See how a U.S.-backed fake news operation spread disinformation about Bolivia's government on social media, among international and American audiences
Understand the multi-layered conspiracy that framed a president for electoral fraud, provoked a military uprising, and shattered a country
With rarely seen evidence and interviews with journalists, academics, and Bolivians on the ground, we aim to draw attention to this tragic and criminal plot against a sovereign country, dispelling the State Department and corporate media myths that enabled it and striking a blow against imperialist aggression.Who we areWe're a team of artists and journalists with a history of independent reporting on issues of empire. Moreover, we're assembling a group of prominent academics, commentators, and other personalities to help place this story in its greater context, who we hope to reveal to you very soon.We need your help!Your contribution to this project helps us increase our production values and more effectively spread the word by:
Allowing us to travel to interview subjects in person
Enabling us to dedicate more time to production and editing
Helping us ascertain rights to music and footage, invest in equipment, and enter the finished documentary into film festivals
Hitting our fundraising goal will allow us to devote all the resources we need to making this project a success and getting the truth out to as many people as possible. Anything else raised up to that point will go into funding the most crucial elements of the project. See the list of perks we offer our contributors, including various credits and other rewards.The impactAs of the time of this writing, justice is yet to be served for the many families victimized during the Bolivian coup. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights has yet to release their final decision. Major conspirators are still walking free, even receiving protection in the United States. Bolivian society has been torn apart by those arguing different interpretations of the events, and the reputation of the country's first indigenous government and the movement behind it has been damaged.Bolivians deserve the truth. And the people of the United States and other countries that took part in this conspiracy deserve to know what their governments do in their name. We hope to offer the definitive statement on Bolivia's 2019 political crisis, using all available evidence to establish without a doubt what took place. Your contribution helps make that happen!Other ways you can helpEven small contributions help! You can also use the share tools above to help spread the word about this project. We're looking to get the word out to as many people as possible before the funding deadline, so please share this page on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other platforms. Making noise about this project in your local activist groups, DSA/PSL chapters, etc. also really helps us out; remember, www.washingtonbullets.movie will take people to this page.Your support will earn our eternal thanks, and the gratitude and solidarity of poor and working-class Bolivians struggling to tell their truth

Resumo
Em seu livro Killing Hope, William Blum documenta mais de 50 exemplos de interferência dos EUA em países ao redor do mundo, quase metade deles na América Latina. No espírito de seu trabalho, trazemos a você a história da subversão da democracia boliviana, que culminou em um golpe fatal e no massacre de dezenas de manifestantes pobres e indígenas.

Descubra como a revolução democrática da Bolívia levantou os pobres e os trabalhadores—e provocou a ira das elites estrangeiras e domésticas.

Saiba como os Estados Unidos interferiram na política boliviana por décadas, desde o governo George W. Bush e o antecipado assassinato de Evo Morales.
Veja como uma operação de notícias falsas apoiada pelos EUA espalhou desinformação sobre o governo boliviano nas redes sociais, para o público internacional e americano.
Entenda a conspiração multifacetada que acusou falsamente um presidente de fraude eleitoral, desencadeou uma revolta militar e dividiu um país.

Com evidências raras e entrevistas com jornalistas, acadêmicos e bolivianos no terreno, nosso objetivo é chamar a atenção para esta trama trágica e criminosa contra um país soberano, desfazendo os mitos do Departamento de Estado e da mídia corporativa que o permitiu e dando um golpe contra as agressões imperialistas.

It is all of that. It's also hilarious (unless you're easily offended, in which case you might want to skip this one). But also, it's the product of hard work and what happens when determination meets opportunity. It's a movie made by a bunch of outsiders you've never heard of and yet somehow, we've managed to find our way to you. We've clawed for every inch to get here. Me, personally? I look back to when I had a freakin' dollar to my name. And now on behalf of my badass team, I'm here, getting to talk to you. This movie's a testament to following your dreams. And not quitting, even if you're moving furniture and living in your parents' basement to get there.OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELPMoney's tight. We respect that. Every buck counts. Let me say that again. Every buck counts. But if you don't have a buck, share us, tell someone about us. Social outreach goes a long way and is heavy lifting we can't do on our own.SEE YOU SOONER THAN LATERThanks for tuning in. We're looking forward to bringing you into our furniture family and sharing this movie with you. Cheers and stay ultimate.Best,Ben and The Team",37.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi everyone, I am Theresa Godly, a professional Actor, Screenwriter and Producer.   I was inspired to write 'The Stranger I Love'<strong> </strong>because two years ago, I suddenly and without explanation lost contact with my child. I am still fighting my own battle in UK family courts.  When this strange behaviour began I was broken, but I pieced myself together and began to research via every avenue I could find.  I soon discovered that I had become another victim of <u><strong>Parental Alienation</strong></u>  -  a term I had never heard of before.  It astounded me that something which affects millions of people globally and so tragically was virtually unheard of! </p>
<p>That got me thinking and led me to write an episodic series which took a year.  The idea to write the short film came from a friend who worked as an EP on 'Trial of the Chicago 7' (nominated for 7 Oscars, 3 BAFTAs and winner of Best screenplay at the 2021 Golden Globes) - I figured he knows his stuff, and embarked on writing this film.  The goal is to make sure everyone knows what Parental Alienation is and that we move towards this being illegal in every country of the world.</p>
<p>Our Director is the inimitable Martin Gooch, who is not only hugely experienced but someone I have known for years, worked with and trust implicitly with this film.  Martin is a BBC trained Director and has worked all over the world with many major broadcasters. He directed the BAFTA award winning and EMMY nominated Spooks Interactive (BBC/Kudos) and is a two time BBC New Director of the Year winner. Martin is a Director known for getting great performances from his actors, and every film and TV show he has directed has won an award. He has directed five feature films and worked on more than 200 productions. Martin has a Masters Degree in screenwriting and over 1000 days on set experience. </p>
<p>This crowdfunding campaign will enable us to raise enough money to hire the best equipment, an experienced crew, and professional actors, as well as supporting artists.  It will assist with location hire, catering, transport,  production insurances and putting sustainability processes in place.  Once we have made the film, the hard work continues with the post-production process. Funds raised will help us to hire an experienced Editor, Sound Mixer, Colour Grader and implement CGI where necessary. All these ingredients go towards making the very best film of the highest sound and picture quality.  Once we have our finished product, we then begin the job of submitting to 176 BAFTA and Academy Awards qualifying film festivals around the world which costs thousands, so funds raised will also help the film to be seen widely and to be considered for various awards.</p>
<p>By donating whatever you can to this crowdfunder, you will be actively helping to affect real change for millions of alienated parents and children.  It will get discussions going around the world which means that the media, and governments have to sit and up and listen.   By educating the world about Parental Alienation;  what it is, it's damaging and destructive results  and how to recognise early signs - we can go some way to preventing other families around the world from being torn apart,  and from  despairing parents taking their own lives.  We really want you to feel you are part of something important, because anyone donating really is and will very much be part of the movement for change.</p>
<p>Hopefully the videos on the crowdfunder page  will go some way to demonstrating just why this film has to be made.  We have been privileged enough to have some very brave victims of Parental Alienation share their stories with us.  They're not easy to watch, but I implore you to. That will make this as real as it gets, especially if you are unaware of the subject matter.</p>
<p>I am not simply a Writer, Actor and Producer - I am an alienated parent who understands first-hand the pain, the grief and the torture of living life without my child. To live in a permanent state of bereavement  whilst trying to get on with daily life.  I hope that my film means alienated parents never having to answer questions like ""Why doesn't your child want to see you?"" or ""What did you do?"" - this film aims to be the catalyst for change around the world where Parental Alienation takes place every single day.</p>

video store clerk, projectionist, background actor, quality assurance tester, film critic, filmmaker.    Born and raised in South Jersey, not far from Philadelphia, he made the move to Los Angeles in 1998 where he continues to work in the film industry.  He wrote and executive produced the multiple award-winning short film A FUNNY THING HAPPENED ON THE WAY TO THE THEATRE.  His essay about JOHN CARPENTER'S THE THING was published in the Amazon bestselling book MY FAVORITE HORROR MOVIE.   Ernie makes his directorial debut with HOWARD THE DOC. MICHAEL KALLIO - PRODUCERProducer Michael Kallio was bitten by the filmmaking bug at the early age of six.  Things snowballed after he worked on a horror movie when he was sixteen.  He has worked in numerous departments within the film industry, including art department, lighting and grip and professional special effects, make-up effects and pyrotechnics.   Michael made his feature film directorial debut with his 2002 film HATRED OF A MINUTE which was produced by genre favorite Bruce Campbell.     He made the permanent move from Detroit to Los Angeles in 2004 and has worked on numerous projects ever since arriving.  He currently has several projects in various stages of development and production, including a documentary about Gunnar Hansen 'DINNER WITH LEATHERFACE' and new projects with Bruce Campbell.                                                                                                                                                       Photo: Zb ImagesBEN GOLOMB - COMPOSER/LYRICISTMusic Composer Ben Golomb (who also doubles as the frontman for the LA-based shoegaze band, Modern Time Machines) has contributed music/songs to projects ranging from Adult Swim’s “The Eric Andre Show”, Netflix’s “My Teacher, My Obsession”, various Lifetime TV movies and short films/commercials, and has been heard on the airwaves on the LA radio station KROQ 106.7FM.  Ben is also scoring various projects in development, including SO HELP YOU GOD by noted filmmaker Ashely York (Netflix’s TIG, HILLBILLY).  Ben was working on a new song with Allee Willis up until her untimely passing.ELENA SWEENEY - SENIOR GRAPHIC DESIGNER Elena Sweeney is a designer, producer, illustrator, and animator. As a producer, she contributed to the feature of Yahoo Finance's Origin Stories. In college, Sweeney began developing her work from zines to animated features in Williamsburg, New York City.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Sally Muiruri, and I am a visual storyteller. I'm working on a new film called 15 Years Later. It’s a short family drama about parent-child re-connection. Having lived apart from my mom for 13 years, my experiences inform this film on how years of separation and distance resulting from migration, affects family relationships.</p>
<p>In the film, we see how the main characters, PATRICIA and her daughter CHLOE struggle with inner thoughts that lead to distrust and regrets. We see how both characters attempt to face their deep emotional pain and come to terms with an unpleasant mismatch between the reality on the ground and their perceptions towards one another.</p>

<p>Gifts of any amount add up. If you are able to give $500 or more, we are offering you an exclusive private screening of the film in Boston, Massachusetts.</p>

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Just This Once follows couple Nora and Michael, as they road-trip towards the California coastline. After many pit-stops and slow downs, an emotionally fragile Nora and a concerned Michael, question wether if and when they will reach their destination. </p>
<p>Ultimately, this is a story about love, guilt, grief, and mental health. Because of first-hand experience and a deep interest in the psychology of humans, I have always been incredibly passionate about breaking down taboos that plague mental health and mental illness. The more we keep these discussions going, the less people might feel alone or ashamed. Just This Once is only the tip of the iceberg, but I sincerely hope it can convey an important truth and spark honest conversation.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The conversation about mental health, mental illness, and suicide prevention is one that needs to be had. Openly, honestly, and frequently. We hope that Just This Once will spark and continue  that conversation. We also are optimistic this film will be able to be screened at many festivals internationally, and hopefully available to the general public in the future. </p>
<p>I am also proud to announce that this crew will be made up mostly of wildly talented women in the industry!</p>

<p>- We aim to accomplish our funding goals by the end of February 2021</p>
<p>-We aim to shoot by late March or early April 2021</p>
<p>-Film submissions to festivals beginning summer 2021</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>One of our main concerns will be keeping our crew and actors safe from COVID-19. Because of the pandemic, much of your donations will be used to have a safety officer on set, per SAG regulations, make sure everyone is regularly tested, and acquire the appropriate PPE.</p>

</div></div>","The Story
Just This Once follows couple Nora and Michael, as they road-trip towards the California coastline. After many pit-stops and slow downs, an emotionally fragile Nora and a concerned Michael, question wether if and when they will reach their destination. 
Ultimately, this is a story about love, guilt, grief, and mental health. Because of first-hand experience and a deep interest in the psychology of humans, I have always been incredibly passionate about breaking down taboos that plague mental health and mental illness. The more we keep these discussions going, the less people might feel alone or ashamed. Just This Once is only the tip of the iceberg, but I sincerely hope it can convey an important truth and spark honest conversation.

Again, our film is a mystery, not a romance even though everything has its time and place.   THANK YOU WHOLEHEARTEDLY... You're valuable to us!

<p><i><strong>Balls of Tin</strong></i> is a web series and is a show within a show. It is a comedy. The first season, for which we are seeking funding, is comprised of six episodes.</p>
<p><i>Balls of Tin</i> takes its title from the oft-used mountain bike phrase ""balls of steel"" for anyone bold enough to do intense, big maneuvers. This is the story of a small film crew attempting to produce a series about freeride mountain biking in New England called <i>New England Freeride Unleashed:</i></p>

<p>Lindsay, the show’s creator and director, is an avid cyclist and is early in her career in making sports media content. She teams up with her cycling pal, Edwardo, to pitch the series idea to her ex-girlfriend, Claire. Claire is an executive with a streaming content producer called NewStream, a subsidiary of  Dane Media Group. Claire is now married to Roger Dane. Claire agrees to back the project with the caveat that they use her stepson, Dan Dane, as the star of the show. Dan Dane believes he is a great rider, but he is not. Thus, <i>Balls of Tin</i>. The story is told from shifting perspectives. The view alternates from the ""meta"" <i>Balls of Tin</i> view of the crew making their series and a view of the <i>New England Freeride Unleashed</i> series they are filming. An additional perspective is offered by the TikTok account of Dan Dane (@TheDanDane) as he takes out his phone to reach out to what he calls ""Dan's Fans.""</p>

<h3>Who are you?</h3>
<p>Hey! I'm Dustin Weible, an independent filmmaker located in Orlando, FL. Since I was three years old, I knew I wanted to make movies. I wasn't exactly sure what that meant at the time, how many thousands of hours it would take to learn the craft, or how impossibly difficult it was to ""break in"" to the industry. All I knew was that I wanted to tell good stories. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1589898488/se44juz9gqrdz6r2wbhs.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I've always financed my own short films up until now. I've spent years building connections and making friends with extremely talented people in this field, and I love collaborating on projects with them. Generally, I could make a short film for a few hundred dollars by utilizing these connections and spending the time in pre-production to cut down the luxury items on my wish list. I want that to change with this next film. There's only so much you can do with small budgets, and while I believe the challenge of working within these constraints is a useful tool to have, I also believe you have to <i>know</i> when you're ready to take it up a notch.</p>
<p>I'm very excited about the possibilities with my new script <i>A Monster in the House.</i> I decided to turn to crowdfunding as a way of helping this project reach its potential, as well as to test out this avenue for even bigger projects down the road.</p>
<p>If you would like to know more about me personally, see some of my work, or meet with me over some coffee, please visit <a href=""http://www.dustinweible.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">my website</a> to find out more!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What is the film about?</h3>
<p><i>A Monster in the House</i> is about two siblings who must learn to confront their childhood traumas when their abusive father passes away. Their old house, where all of their bad memories remain, is handed down to them. So, they task themselves with cleaning it out to sell and be rid of those memories for good. But their demons don't go away so easily. Sometimes, those demons fight back.</p>
<p>First and foremost, this is a horror film. The story takes place in an old two story home filled with atmosphere, and once the monster comes out to play, things get crazy. The highest compliment I've received from everyone who has read the script is that they got chills when the monster is first introduced. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1589898287/weagm2kiz75u8arhu9cz.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Secondly, this is a drama film. We want to portray a realistic brother-sister relationship. Growing up in an abusive household with shared-trauam brings them close together, but like with anyone, sometimes it's difficult to express what's really going on inside you, so you deflect with humor instead of tackling your emotions head-on.</p>
<p>Thirdly, this is a physiological deep dive into the effects of childhood abuse, depression and addiction. How do your past experiences define you? What are you passing down to your children? How do you cope with trauma? I hope watching this short film will make you ask the same questions.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What do you need from me?</h3>
<p>Simply put, we need around $5,000... but more would be nice too.</p>
<p>Yes, short films may be less expensive than features, but making movies in and of itself is an expensive adventure. Let me break down the costs if we did everything the right way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cast - $1,000 (5 actors, 4 days of production with SAG minimum payment)</li>
<li>Crew - $5,000 (10-12 crew members behind the scenes over 4 days of production)</li>
<li>Costume/Wardrobe - $3,000 (Custom monsters are expensive)</li>
<li>Set Design/Props - $1,500 (Your sets need to look as nice as the actors)</li>
<li>Equipment Rentals - $1000 (Good cameras and lenses don't come cheap)</li>
<li>Craft Services - $500 (People gotta eat)</li>
<li>BTS Photographer - $400 (Perfect for promotion and updating producers)</li>
<li>Stunt Coordinator (or VFX) - $2,500 (There's a pretty big stunt in the film)</li>
<li>Location - $1,000 (The house will make or break the entire story)</li>
<li>Post Audio - $3,000 (If a movie looks good but sounds horrible, I bet you won't watch it)</li>
<li>Music Composer - $3,000 (Building custom tension one note at a time)</li>
<li>Festival Budgets/Marketing - $1,500 (We gotta get it out there somehow)</li>
</ul>
<p>Grand Total - $22,400</p>
<p>Of course, this is the ideal number. We can make adjustments, ask favors, cut some services and ultimately settle for cheaper options, but with a little more latitude, we can do so much more.</p>
<p>That's why we have set our goal to $10,000. We believe this would be the perfect balance between doing what we want and doing what we can. The quality will still be there, but the favors will still need to be asked.</p>
<p>With that being said, for everyone who contributes, we have some pretty cool rewards for you.</p>

<h3>Ancient story. Modern jokes.</h3>
<p>BAE WOLF is a feature-length horror-comedy set in the world of the Beowulf legend.</p>
<p>In our telling of this timeless tale, the hero Beowulf is a woman and a con artist. She and her band of Geats extort villages for protection against fake monsters. But the Danish village of Heorot really is under assault by a very real monster, the desperately-lonely Grendel. Her fraud exposed, Beowulf must transform into a genuine warrior.</p>
<p>Shot on location at a medieval-style castle in Trenton, South Carolina, BAE WOLF boasts striking and authentic production design. But its tone, language, humor and conflicts are all very modern.</p>

<h3>Comedy that is out of this world!</h3>
<p><i>""Bug-Eyed Monsters Invade the Earth!"" </i>is the new movie from Canadian actor and filmmaker Anthony D.P. Mann (<i>The Wicker Man</i>, <i>Terror of Dracula</i>, <i>Return to Frightenstein</i>). The film is a story of the things that we love, and those parts of our childhood that we can’t let go of... it’s about love, loss, disappointment, triumph… and it’s got bug-eyed monsters, so what more could you possibly ask for?</p>
<p>As you can tell from the title, the movie is an homage to classic sci-fi films and TV series of the 1950's and 60's, as well as a celebration of our fellow fanboys / fangirls and geekdom everywhere. The plot involves a bus tour taking fans of the obscure TV show “<i>The Adventures of Professor Qur-I/0</i>” to various locations where the series was shot. When the bus breaks down in the middle of nowhere, this band of misfits finds themselves in the middle of a REAL alien invasion, and it’s up to the old series star - Professor Qur-I/0 himself! - to save the day.</p>
<p>In a major coup for our production, ""Klakk"" - the central alien menace of the film - will be voiced by legendary actor Sylvester McCoy, best known for his portrayal of the seventh television incarnation of <i>Doctor Who</i>, and as ""Radagast the Brown"" in Peter Jackson's <i>Hobbit</i> movies. Sylvester has already completed his work on <i>Bug-Eyed Monsters Invade the Earth!</i></p>

<h3>PROJECT SUMMARY </h3>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/544299239?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>""Ampe Study; or Leap into the Sky, Black Girl'' is a documentary film by Ghanaian and Nigerian artists Chineze Okpalaoka, Ife Oluwamuyide, and Claudia Owusu. Set in Columbus, OH and Accra, Ghana, the film highlights the journey of Black Girlhood and the relationships that Ghanaian girls have with their childhood selves through the lens of the traditional game, ampe. Ampe is a rhythmic, high-energy game played by girls in Ghana, West Africa. It includes jumping, clapping, and an all-around cheer and hype as two teams select a stepping pattern and face off. The teams have leading players, referred to as “the mothers'', who start the game and encourage players to compete at their best. The innate joy and competitive edge of ampe reveals the desire that Black girls have to be set free and feel a range of emotions without judgement.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>PROJECT FOCUS</h3>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/544298930?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>Ampe is slowly disappearing from the Ghanaian-American cultural landscape; and it's now rare to see Ghanaian girls in Columbus, OH engaging in the game, even though Columbus is home to over 10,000 Ghanaian immigrants and stands as a sister city to Accra, Ghana. With each new generation of immigrants, there’s a loss of history and personal connection. Ampe Study; or Leap into the Sky, Black Girl seeks to reconcile and preserve the cultural memory of Ghanaian traditions. By documenting the experiences of 10 young Ghanaian women in Columbus and Accra, we want to understand the history of ampe as a coming-of-age ritual across the African diaspora, how it informs the way Ghanaian women view themselves, each other, and the world around them.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many platforms to cancel grant applications or place them on a temporary hold; due to this, we have experienced great difficulty acquiring funds, which has caused us to delay our production timeline. The pandemic has also placed a barrier in our ability to access our subjects due to past flight cancellations and lockdowns. With all of these factors in mind, we are motivated to conduct a safe and sensible production. Before shooting begins, we will require that the cast and crew take COVID-19 tests and wear masks on set. Our first-aid kit will include a thermometer to check temperatures and fevers. As we handle different equipment and props, we will sanitize all surfaces and areas after each interview, and socially distance while on set, and in between shoots. Before we leave for Ghana, we will quarantine for two weeks, take a rapid-result COVID-19 test 72 hours before our flight, and take another test upon arrival. We’ll also take another COVID-19 test 72 hours before our departure from Ghana. We understand the life-threatening effects of COVID-19, and intend to follow all the rules and regulations from the CDC guidelines.</p>

As he nears the end of his court-mandated rehabilitation, Martin is still unable to fight his urges and begins to peep again. It is then that he discovers Rowan, the girl of his dreams. As his obsession with her grows, he begins to suspect that she may be involved with the occult. Using his peeping skills, Martin begins an investigation that leads him down a twisted path to something more horrible than anything he could ever imagine and realizes that all the while, he's being watched himself.Every movie begins as a spark of artistic inspiration followed by generating sufficient funds to provide tinder vital for turning sparks into healthy, crackling, flames.  Creating an independent, high quality, low-budget, feature-length film during a global pandemic just may be the equivalent of creating fire without matches in the rain forest, but with determination, hard work, and your help, we believe our little spark can roar.Creating a low-budget independent film means that 100% of each donation will be spent creating a thought-provoking movie even the most ardent fans of psychological horror will find challenging. All the funds raised here will cover pre-determined costs within our stringent budget and will go towards physical production, taking us through the completion of principal photography, not towards the craft table.  We hope you will join us in creating a movie even the most ardent psychological horror fans and movie lovers will find nuanced, challenging, and worthy of rewatching again and again.To not compromise our vision, we are combining our own funds and resources, such as wonderful filming locations throughout Connecticut, with this campaign. We arrived at our funding goal only after our own funds were depleted, all other avenues exhausted, and every resource we could muster confirmed. While unusual, the route of combining our own funds with a fundraising campaign should attest to our relentless passion and confidence in this film.By sharing our unbridled confidence and conviction in this movie, we hope it will engender you to support us, allowing for the creation of a movie that will carve out a place in the hallowed halls of our beloved genre of horror. Movie-makers apologetic about creating horror movies are growing tiresome.

<h2>Welcome to Dropout Productions! </h2>
<p>My name is Ari Lozano, and I am the founder of Dropout Productions and the writer/director of the brand new short-film MADRUGADA. The team and I couldn't be more excited about this project, and we hope you will be too!</p>
<p>My journey as a film maker has just begun, however I have been involved in the film industry for some time, working on films and commercials in many different capacities. The appreciation and knowledge I have gained during this time has been invaluable. Because the film industry was put on hold due to the pandemic, I decided to undertake my own project to submit for the 2022 spring film festival season.</p>
<p>The team that we have put together is made up of extremely talented, professional, and enthusiastic individuals who all share the same passion for creative endeavors, specifically movies! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>MADRUGADA Plot Summary</h3>
<p>Zane, a hopeless romantic, sits at a bar with his two outcast friends, building up the courage to finally talk to his secret crush Blanche, the bartender. However, Zane is soon going to realize that there are bigger, scarier, and more hairy obstacles in his way than he anticipated, and it's going to be a long night.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Empower a Community</h3>
<p>We are located in Denton, Texas which is also where the film takes place. This small Texas college town is overflowing with young, eager, creative minds that are desperate for a chance to put their expertise to use, and Dropout Productions has managed to do just that. </p>
<p>With your contribution, you will single-handedly allow a tight-knit community of friends, artists and collaborators, the ability to infuse their talents and creative perspectives through the wonderful medium of film! </p>

<p>Sarah Harley: Sarah has had a passion for acting for as long as she can remember. Early childhood was spent directing and performing plays with her siblings in her family’s living room until she finally became involved in community theatre at the age of 11. Sarah earned her Bachelor of Science in Performance/Directing and Musical Theatre from Northwestern State University of Louisiana. During her time in college, Sarah received special training in performing Shakespeare, Ibsen and Chekhov, as well as Stage Combat. Throughout her theatre career, she earned several awards for her performances (Best Featured Actress - Penny/Hairspray; Irene Ryan Award Nominee – Echo/Eleemosynary; Best Actress – Brooke Wyeth/Other Desert Cities;  Best Actress – Wendy/Peter Pan). Sarah has also worked on short films across the country and we are excited to have her on the team.</p>

<h3>Why Your Contribution Helps So Much! </h3>
<p>We have spent many hours crafting the budget to be as economical as possible without sacrificing the quality of the film. This means that every donation, big or small, will help enable us to accomplish our aspirations. Below are examples of what we will need to make our film. </p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong><u>Costumes and props</u> </strong>- When you see the word ""costume"" you might think Victorian period-piece or a cowboy wearing a leather vest. There will be no curly wigs or spurs featured in this story, however, we need to be able to appropriately dress our characters in a way that expresses who they are as individuals, so the audience can better understand them in the story. </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong><u>Lens rental</u> </strong>- If you've ever been behind a camera, you will agree that one of the most important aspects of capturing great shots is the lens (and lighting). We have found a fantastic local company that rents camera gear at resonable prices. Your contributions will allow us to get high-quality gear on set for our talented camera crew to use, turning our super- fun project into a super-fun project that looks great! </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<u><strong>Location fees</strong></u> - We are thrilled to announce that we were able to snag a fantastic location for free, thanks to our awesome producers and wonderful community that believes in our efforts and supports local art! This will enable us to boost the production quality of the film by dispersing the location fees of the budget as needed.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<u><strong>Hair and makeup</strong></u> (and prosthetics!!...shhhhhh) - It's fun to watch an actor go from zero to hero in a four-minute montage, while we lay on the couch and try to throw pieces of popcorn into our mouths. What we usually don't realize is that the four-minute montage probably took a minimum of three days of twelve-hour shooting! This means that someone had to make the actor oily or sweaty or dirty every single moment of the three-day shoot! Let's not even mention the effort it takes to make someone look beat up or bloody. Your contribution will allow us to buy the necessary products our talented makeup-team needs in order to create popcorn-munching movie magic! </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong><u>Set design </u></strong>- If you do it right, the attention to detail in the set design can and should immerse the character and the audience by creating an environment that feels authentic to the story. When you make a donation, it will allow us to create the environment for the characters to exist in, and as a result, produce the movie-going experience we are all striving for! </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong><u>Composer and Music licensing</u></strong> - Have you ever watched ""Jaws"" with the sound off? OF COURSE NOT! The animatronic shark is almost powerless without the brilliance of John Williams' score lurking alongside it. We realize that music and sound might be one of the most important aspects of making a good film, and people with the ability to write good music are far and few between. Fortunately, our team has moved mountains again, and we have found a professional composer (with Broadway credentials) to volunteer his talents to write and oversee the music portion of the project. With your contribution, we will be able to complete this very valuable part of the process using the funds for sound equipment and music licensing fees which can add up very quickly. </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong><u>Film Festival Entry Fees</u></strong> - Festivals are an important part of the independent filmmaker's journey and we're not just talking backstage passes. As mentioned before, our ultimate goal is to get MADRUGADA shown at film festivals all around the country and the world. This can potentially lead to more exposure, naturally connecting us to more donors, which in turn will help us be able to continue making movies. Film Festival entry fees can range from $25 to $125. Your donation will assist us in entering MADRUGADA in the film festival circuit arena, so that we have the chance to not only continue doing what we love, but to be able to share what we love with the rest of the world. </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>We want to show our appreciation for your donation by offering ""perks"" to those of you who contribute specific amounts we feel will have a large impact on the progress of our project. Check out the perks we offer at the top of this page! </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you find yourself in a position where you are interested in our project but can not financially contribute, do not be dismayed. Help us by spreading the word about our film through social media, email and the Indiegogo share tools! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are extremely excited to collaborate our efforts and see this project though. Thank you so much for your time and for your interest in Dropout Productions, and in our brand-new film MADRUGADA! </p>

The animatronic shark is almost powerless without the brilliance of John Williams' score lurking alongside it. We realize that music and sound might be one of the most important aspects of making a good film, and people with the ability to write good music are far and few between. Fortunately, our team has moved mountains again, and we have found a professional composer (with Broadway credentials) to volunteer his talents to write and oversee the music portion of the project. With your contribution, we will be able to complete this very valuable part of the process using the funds for sound equipment and music licensing fees which can add up very quickly. 
 

Film Festival Entry Fees - Festivals are an important part of the independent filmmaker's journey and we're not just talking backstage passes. As mentioned before, our ultimate goal is to get MADRUGADA shown at film festivals all around the country and the world. This can potentially lead to more exposure, naturally connecting us to more donors, which in turn will help us be able to continue making movies. Film Festival entry fees can range from $25 to $125. Your donation will assist us in entering MADRUGADA in the film festival circuit arena, so that we have the chance to not only continue doing what we love, but to be able to share what we love with the rest of the world. 
 
Perks
We want to show our appreciation for your donation by offering ""perks"" to those of you who contribute specific amounts we feel will have a large impact on the progress of our project. Check out the perks we offer at the top of this page!

<p>    I read Lovecraft for the first time by accident. It was a strange chain of events that started the most important project of my life.</p>
<p>   When I was fifteen, I was listening to Metallica's ""<i>Call of Ktulu</i>"", and that strange name made me curious. I searched on the internet and read about Lovecraft, the monster, the story ... But I didn't think much more about it.<br/>   Months later, I don't know how or why, the name mysteriously returned to my mind: <strong>Cthulhu</strong>.<br/>   I was going to buy the book on the Internet, but my father stopped me and said, ""Look, the book is in the library"". So I looked at the top shelf of the library and there was this row of very old white booklets. When I took the book, it was small, ruined, with a really bad cover and yellowed pages. Suddenly I was reluctant to read it. Nevertheless, that night, I started reading.   I read it overnight. I was sorry to find that the story was very short, 33 pages, but immediately afterwards it began another one: ""<i>The Shadow Over Innsmouth</i>"". I was shaken by those stories, and they became a fixed idea in my mind.</p>
<p>   During high school I started thinking of making a movie about Lovecraft and his creatures... Searching the Internet, I didn't find anything faithfully representing the story of Cthulhu or the inhabitants of Innsmouth. So I started writing the script, dutifully following the two stories and weaving them together with caution.</p>
<p>   After many years the script was ready, but I've realized it was just an utopian idea...</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Or <strong>maybe not</strong>?</p>
<p>   I got some notions of 3D animation and doing the movie in this way seemed like the best approach. So I assembled a <strong>team</strong> of designers, 3D modelers, animators and we started to work on this teaser trailer...</p>

<p>  In 1926, a young student finds, among documents left to him by his deceased great-uncle, a clay statuette representing a <strong>strange monster</strong>... From the notes of his uncle, he learns that the sculpture is the work of contemporary artist Henry Wilcox, who made it after awakening from a <strong>nightmare</strong>. Driven by his strong curiosity, the young man begins to connect <strong>several stories</strong>, like puzzle pieces coming from different places and different times.</p>
<p>  What combines the <strong>delirious nightmares</strong> of a young artist, the <strong>report </strong>of an elderly New Orleans police inspector, the story of a <strong>Greenland expedition</strong>, and the <strong>diary</strong> of a Norwegian sailor who <strong>died in mysterious circumstances</strong>?</p>
<p>   What is the unholy <strong>Cult of Cthulhu</strong> that unites all these stories?</p>
<p>   In parallel, another student travels with the intention of visiting the most characteristic location in Massachusetts. He arrives in the sinister <strong>harbor town of Innsmouth</strong>, whose gloomy and mysterious citizens hide an enormous and <strong>unspeakable secret</strong>...</p>
<p>   Between the walls of those houses,<strong> horror awaits the innocent prey...</strong></p>

<p>   While we were writing the script we realized the impossibility of making the film in live action, at least in a satisfactory and professional way for our means. Setting everything in 1920's America (and we're Italians …) is quite impossible for us. It would be just as impossible to create locations such as the fantastical R'lyeh, the foreboding Innsmouth and many others - not to mention Cthulhu himself!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511536747/zvoeanicirhvpxovtjgq.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>   <strong>Animation</strong> seemed the solution to the problem. Animation affords a greater, more precise <strong>style</strong>, as well as being more <strong>artistic </strong>and <strong>functional </strong>to the story.</p>

<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518475025/tvc8abg6ztol4fivu1yz.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>

<p>   When the idea of bringing Cthulhu and the inhabitants of Innsmouth to life came into our minds – it was 2011- we started to organize the workflow in <strong>every single detail</strong>.  </p>
<p>   We decided to start with small steps, which is why the campaign goal is ""low"" (compared to the budget normally needed in such productions). But nothing prohibits us from overcoming our goals and moving in leaps and bounds!</p>
<p>   The <strong>first</strong> <strong>step</strong>, is to realize the concepts for every visual aspect, which will be the basis for the creation of 3d models (characters, locations, props, etc), and to draw a precise <strong>storyboard </strong>of every shot. Basically, we need <strong>professional artists</strong>!  </p>
<div>   Then, we need to give to all the characters a voice of their own! In the production of an animated movie, voices are recorded before the animation process itself, to allow the animators to synchronize the character's mouth during dialogue. So, we need <strong>professional voice actors</strong>.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>   These are the two principals goals we're trying to reach with this campaign.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>   After completing these two steps, we will start with the actual <strong>production phase</strong>, using the budget collected through this campaign.</div>
<div> </div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>Almost a third of the estimated budget</i></strong><br/><strong><i>will be allocated to the realization<br/>and delivery of rewards.</i></strong></p>

Beyond the Contribution




    I read Lovecraft for the first time by accident. It was a strange chain of events that started the most important project of my life.
   When I was fifteen, I was listening to Metallica's ""Call of Ktulu"", and that strange name made me curious. I searched on the internet and read about Lovecraft, the monster, the story ... But I didn't think much more about it.   Months later, I don't know how or why, the name mysteriously returned to my mind: Cthulhu.   I was going to buy the book on the Internet, but my father stopped me and said, ""Look, the book is in the library"". So I looked at the top shelf of the library and there was this row of very old white booklets. When I took the book, it was small, ruined, with a really bad cover and yellowed pages. Suddenly I was reluctant to read it. Nevertheless, that night, I started reading.   I read it overnight. I was sorry to find that the story was very short, 33 pages, but immediately afterwards it began another one: ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth"". I was shaken by those stories, and they became a fixed idea in my mind.
   During high school I started thinking of making a movie about Lovecraft and his creatures... Searching the Internet, I didn't find anything faithfully representing the story of Cthulhu or the inhabitants of Innsmouth. So I started writing the script, dutifully following the two stories and weaving them together with caution.
   After many years the script was ready, but I've realized it was just an utopian idea...
Or maybe not?
   I got some notions of 3D animation and doing the movie in this way seemed like the best approach. So I assembled a team of designers, 3D modelers, animators and we started to work on this teaser trailer...



  In 1926, a young student finds, among documents left to him by his deceased great-uncle, a clay statuette representing a strange monster... From the notes of his uncle, he learns that the sculpture is the work of contemporary artist Henry Wilcox, who made it after awakening from a nightmare. Driven by his strong curiosity, the young man begins to connect several stories, like puzzle pieces coming from different places and different times.
  What combines the delirious nightmares of a young artist, the report of an elderly New Orleans police inspector, the story of a Greenland expedition, and the diary of a Norwegian sailor who died in mysterious circumstances?
   What is the unholy Cult of Cthulhu that unites all these stories?
   In parallel, another student travels with the intention of visiting the most characteristic location in Massachusetts. He arrives in the sinister harbor town of Innsmouth, whose gloomy and mysterious citizens hide an enormous and unspeakable secret...
   Between the walls of those houses, horror awaits the innocent prey...


   While we were writing the script we realized the impossibility of making the film in live action, at least in a satisfactory and professional way for our means. Setting everything in 1920's America (and we're Italians …) is quite impossible for us. It would be just as impossible to create locations such as the fantastical R'lyeh, the foreboding Innsmouth and many others - not to mention Cthulhu himself!

   Animation seemed the solution to the problem. Animation affords a greater, more precise style, as well as being more artistic and functional to the story.
 

   An animatic is an animated storyboard. Boards are cut together with the correct timing and pace of the film. They include basic sound effects, dialogue recordings and scratch soundtrack.
   Take a look!

 

   When the idea of bringing Cthulhu and the inhabitants of Innsmouth to life came into our minds – it was 2011- we started to organize the workflow in every single detail.  
   We decided to start with small steps, which is why the campaign goal is ""low"" (compared to the budget normally needed in such productions). But nothing prohibits us from overcoming our goals and moving in leaps and bounds!
   The first step, is to realize the concepts for every visual aspect, which will be the basis for the creation of 3d models (characters, locations, props, etc), and to draw a precise storyboard of every shot. Basically, we need professional artists!  
   Then, we need to give to all the characters a voice of their own! In the production of an animated movie, voices are recorded before the animation process itself, to allow the animators to synchronize the character's mouth during dialogue. So, we need professional voice actors.  
 
   These are the two principals goals we're trying to reach with this campaign.
 
   After completing these two steps, we will start with the actual production phase, using the budget collected through this campaign.
 
Almost a third of the estimated budgetwill be allocated to the realizationand delivery of rewards.


   These perks were carefully imagined by our team. Some of them are limited perks, due to manufacting and shipping cost – so hurry up! 
   For a more detailed description of the content of each reward check the column to the right.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>""Gabriel’s script ‘Finding Your True Self’ is from the heart and delves into so many emotions. We should be giving filmmakers like Gabriel the opportunity to develop their voice and make films that they care deeply about. I can’t wait to see this script brought to life.""<i> - </i>Chris Foggin, Director, <i>Fisherman's Friends.</i></strong></p>
<h3><u>The Premise</u></h3>
<p><i>Finding Your True Self </i>is a slice of life story about James, an isolated young man whose only primary human contact is his controlling brother Charlie, whom James also lives with. A chance encounter with best friends Rosalind and Dave, a pair of fun, outgoing personalities, allows James the chance to break free of Charlie, while simultaneously giving him a new chance at friendship and life in general.</p>
<p>With influence from works such as <i>God Help the Girl</i>, <i>T2 Trainspotting</i>, and <i>The Perks of Being a Wallflower</i>, and undertones of drama and romance, <i>Finding Your True Self</i> is a film with an award winning script and an extremely talented cast, set to shoot in the North East of England in early 2021.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606854960/khebs4kyvepphlswcctk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3><u>Production Background</u></h3>
<p>In the crazy times we are living in, we are endeavouring to stay creative, and <i>Finding Your True Self</i> is the result! </p>
<p>This film is important to us due to its relatable nature. It is about real people working their way through life, all with very different personalities and stories. This is a true to life tale that looks at strained relationships, and the coming of age you undergo during your 20's.</p>
<p>This film is important to us because of where we live. The North East is relatively lacking when it comes to film shoots, and we want to change that! We want to show that this area is full of talent and potential, and that there are dedicated and passionate filmmakers here with stories to tell.</p>
<p>As well as that, another factor that is key to the creation of this film is our hope to showcase the North East as an amazing area for filming. We plan on utilising plenty of local venues as well as engaging with the amazing businesses we have here.</p>
<p>We also have an absolutely fantastic cast that includes a handful of North East based actors, as well as one young rising star!</p>

<p> </p>
<p>We've also had some amazing reviews of the script:</p>
<p><strong><i>""The script takes advantage of its seemingly simple premise and, with its heart, essence and identity, turns it into a very dynamic and emotive story of growth and personal triumph.</i></strong><i><strong>This is a very original story that dares to explore somewhat dark but important themes, without going overboard.""</strong> </i>- Feel The Reel International Film Festival</p>
<p><i><strong>""The concept is compelling and reliable. The author explores an exciting idea that proves to be among the script’s strengths. This is a quality drama that should see the light of the day.""</strong> </i>- The Monthly Film Festival</p>
<p>The film has also had some further festival selections as well at Bridge Fest and the Rome Independent Prisma Awards.</p>

<h3><u>What We Need &amp; What You Get!</u></h3>
<p>A great amount of time has been spent totting up the costs of putting something like this together. We are doing our best to keep things lower budget and self funded where at all possible, but some help from you will help us truly bring this project to life.</p>
<p>When talking about funding delegations, we agreed that there would be prioritised delegations of funding which would be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accommodation - £1,580. Some of our actors will need a place to stay for filming, and our intention is also to combine their accommodation with filming locations to help lower costs. </li>
<li>Food - £920. Everyone needs to be well fed on set, and a well fed cast and crew is a happy cast and crew! This is our total allocation based on cast and crews numbers for each day, with a total of 17 shooting days.</li>
<li>Actor and Crew Expenses - £835. At the absolute minimum, we want to be able to cover any travel costs for our cast and crew. This total is based on various methods of transport that cast and crew will be using, and is again based on a per day basis.</li>
<li>Drone &amp; Props  - £120. There's a scene in the film where we plan to show off Newcastle in all its natural beauty, and some drone footage will help us do just that. Aside from this, there are one or two unique props to be created for the film, and an allocation of costs will go to these.</li>
<li>Covid Safety - £33. We already have a temperature gun, but these funds will help us purchase additional face coverings and a large hand sanitiser to help us keep clean and stay safe on set!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Any additional amounts generated beyond our funding goal will be placed into areas to generally improve the film and get it seen by as many people as possible, such as paying for screening events to allow the film to be shown to a wider audience.</p>
<p>We have a host of brilliant perks including originally written and personalised monologues for actors, business promo videos, signed scripts, and Zoom calls with our cast and crew!</p>
<p>Every perk has been thought out with the film and TV world in mind, ideal for those working both in front of and behind the camera! That said, there are still plenty of perks to be enjoyed by all, such as a digital download of the film, PDF's of the script, and product placement opportunities.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><u>Risks &amp; Challenges</u></h3>
<p>As is expected, the main challenge we face is the coronavirus, the elephant in the room! However, we will be undertaking many precautions to make sure our cast and crew are as safe as can be.</p>
<p>Firstly, we are creating two varying shooting schedules. One of these will be for tier 1, with interior and exterior scenes being permitted for filming. However we are also creating a tier 2/3 shooting schedule, prioritising exterior scenes first, so no matter what, we will be able to film come February!</p>
<p>As well as this we will have all the expected precautions on set, including social distancing, face coverings, hand sanitiser, and temperature checks before entry into any location. All cast and crew will also be completing the ‘Coronavirus basic awareness on production training’ assessment recommended and provided by ScreenSkills UK.</p>
<p>We will be doing everything we possibly can to create a fun, but safe, shooting environment!</p>

We should be giving filmmakers like Gabriel the opportunity to develop their voice and make films that they care deeply about. I can’t wait to see this script brought to life."" - Chris Foggin, Director, Fisherman's Friends.
The Premise
Finding Your True Self is a slice of life story about James, an isolated young man whose only primary human contact is his controlling brother Charlie, whom James also lives with. A chance encounter with best friends Rosalind and Dave, a pair of fun, outgoing personalities, allows James the chance to break free of Charlie, while simultaneously giving him a new chance at friendship and life in general.
With influence from works such as God Help the Girl, T2 Trainspotting, and The Perks of Being a Wallflower, and undertones of drama and romance, Finding Your True Self is a film with an award winning script and an extremely talented cast, set to shoot in the North East of England in early 2021.

Production Background
In the crazy times we are living in, we are endeavouring to stay creative, and Finding Your True Self is the result! 
This film is important to us due to its relatable nature. It is about real people working their way through life, all with very different personalities and stories. This is a true to life tale that looks at strained relationships, and the coming of age you undergo during your 20's.
This film is important to us because of where we live. The North East is relatively lacking when it comes to film shoots, and we want to change that! We want to show that this area is full of talent and potential, and that there are dedicated and passionate filmmakers here with stories to tell.
As well as that, another factor that is key to the creation of this film is our hope to showcase the North East as an amazing area for filming. We plan on utilising plenty of local venues as well as engaging with the amazing businesses we have here.
We also have an absolutely fantastic cast that includes a handful of North East based actors, as well as one young rising star!

Awards And Reviews
The script itself has already been a recipient of several awards at a range of film festivals.
The script has won the following awards so far:

Best First Time Screenwriter - Best Script Awards
Feature Script (Outstanding Achievement Award) - Calcutta International Cult Film Festival
Best Screenwriter Of The Month - CKF International Film Festival
Feature Script (Outstanding Achievement Award) - Cult Critic Movie Awards
Honorable Mention: First Time Screenwriter - Kosice International Monthly Film Festival
Best Feature Script - Prague International Monthly Film Festival
Feature Script (Critic's Choice Award) - Tagore International Film Festival
2nd Place (Best Written Screenplay) - Feel The Reel International Film Festival

 

 
We've also had some amazing reviews of the script:
""The script takes advantage of its seemingly simple premise and, with its heart, essence and identity, turns it into a very dynamic and emotive story of growth and personal triumph.This is a very original story that dares to explore somewhat dark but important themes, without going overboard."" - Feel The Reel International Film Festival
""The concept is compelling and reliable. The author explores an exciting idea that proves to be among the script’s strengths. This is a quality drama that should see the light of the day."" - The Monthly Film Festival
The film has also had some further festival selections as well at Bridge Fest and the Rome Independent Prisma Awards.

 
What We Need & What You Get!
A great amount of time has been spent totting up the costs of putting something like this together. We are doing our best to keep things lower budget and self funded where at all possible, but some help from you will help us truly bring this project to life.
When talking about funding delegations, we agreed that there would be prioritised delegations of funding which would be as follows:

Accommodation - £1,580. Some of our actors will need a place to stay for filming, and our intention is also to combine their accommodation with filming locations to help lower costs. 
Food - £920. Everyone needs to be well fed on set, and a well fed cast and crew is a happy cast and crew! This is our total allocation based on cast and crews numbers for each day, with a total of 17 shooting days.
Actor and Crew Expenses - £835. At the absolute minimum, we want to be able to cover any travel costs for our cast and crew. This total is based on various methods of transport that cast and crew will be using, and is again based on a per day basis.
Drone & Props  - £120. There's a scene in the film where we plan to show off Newcastle in all its natural beauty, and some drone footage will help us do just that. Aside from this, there are one or two unique props to be created for the film, and an allocation of costs will go to these.
Covid Safety - £33. We already have a temperature gun, but these funds will help us purchase additional face coverings and a large hand sanitiser to help us keep clean and stay safe on set!

 
Any additional amounts generated beyond our funding goal will be placed into areas to generally improve the film and get it seen by as many people as possible, such as paying for screening events to allow the film to be shown to a wider audience.
We have a host of brilliant perks including originally written and personalised monologues for actors, business promo videos, signed scripts, and Zoom calls with our cast and crew!
Every perk has been thought out with the film and TV world in mind, ideal for those working both in front of and behind the camera! That said, there are still plenty of perks to be enjoyed by all, such as a digital download of the film, PDF's of the script, and product placement opportunities.
 

Risks & Challenges
As is expected, the main challenge we face is the coronavirus, the elephant in the room! However, we will be undertaking many precautions to make sure our cast and crew are as safe as can be.
Firstly, we are creating two varying shooting schedules. One of these will be for tier 1, with interior and exterior scenes being permitted for filming. However we are also creating a tier 2/3 shooting schedule, prioritising exterior scenes first, so no matter what, we will be able to film come February!
As well as this we will have all the expected precautions on set, including social distancing, face coverings, hand sanitiser, and temperature checks before entry into any location. All cast and crew will also be completing the ‘Coronavirus basic awareness on production training’ assessment recommended and provided by ScreenSkills UK.
We will be doing everything we possibly can to create a fun, but safe, shooting environment!
 
Our Cast
We have a fantastic cast already signed on to help make this film the best it can be, including feature film newcomers and one rising star!

<p>Hi all! This is Nadia, the director/producer of Phishing. We are so excited to share this story with you. Phishing finds our protagonist at a major crossroads in her life. It's inspired by real women who pioneered a new form of digital connection through BBS servers, like the one where Cassidy meets Alice, our supporting lead. BBS's were a series of virtual bulletin boards that briefly existed before the dawn of the internet age. It was a dial-up operation that allowed tech savvy youth to interact in ways previously unthinkable. They could be anonymous. They could message each other through an early form of email. They could meet without ever having to leave their homes. When I learned about these servers, I wondered how it must have felt to experience this kind of privacy for the first time. I was curious about the ways it could be utilized to build community and explore identity. </p>
<p>Luckily for me, nothing on the internet is ever truly lost. I found several archives of lgbt+ women discussing their experiences on these servers. One member in particular described how quickly and fully she and another member fell in love. In her words, it was because they saw each other for who they were before they ever saw one another's faces. Some developed lifelong friendships. Others used the spaces like a private group journal. Conversely, some women stayed anonymous, either closeted, married, or simply curious. These servers provided safe havens for queer women at a time when they were desperately needed. I wanted to tell a story set in this period as a way to highlight this forgotten history. </p>
<p>Once I knew the story would take place in the early 80s, I set about finding a team to help connect our modern filmmaking practices to some of the iconic techniques and aesthetics popularized in the era. We hope this film will serve as an homage to 1980s queer stories both real and imagined. We'd love to recruit you on our journey to making this possible. Any donation would help.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We endeavor to create a COVID safe production environment. While all people involved in the project are fully vaccinated, we are monitoring CDC guidelines for any additional guidance and guidelines.

<h2>About the Film </h2>
<p><i>Stumblers, </i>is a dramatic comedy short about four high school students from starkly different backgrounds who are brought together under accusations of a threat. Stuck together in a detention room, the four find unlikely common ground as they await their fates. Inspired by <i>The Breakfast Club, </i>this film is sure to leave people invested in each of the characters lives, and what they will do next. </p>
<p>This film is our senior thesis project and we want to make it as professional as possible. In order to make the film the best it can be we need funding. All funds will go towards equipment rentals, food for cast and crew, location, costumes, props, film festival entries, paying actors, etc. It is crucial that we secure the funds necessary to make this the highest production value possible and really bring the script to life. </p>

<p>Thank you for checking out our project!</p>
<p>My name is Jackson Davis, and I'm Stumblers writer and director!</p>
<p>I am currently a senior at San Diego State University studying Television, Film, and New Media with an emphasis in Production. </p>
<p>When I first joined the major in the Fall of 2019, I wanted to challenge myself by creating a story that allows people to identify with characters with whom they wouldn’t have expected to identify and see others through a more open, inclusive lens.</p>
<p>The classic movies from the 80’s that so many people love, and that I love, have all white characters.  I want to create a movie in this genre, where all people can see themselves, identifying with both characters who look like them and characters who do not.</p>
<p>Stumblers is a story I hold close to my heart that I’m excited to share with you. </p>
<p>I really appreciate you taking the time to look into our project. I hope you decide to join us on this journey!</p>

<p>Hi! My Name is Katie Russell and I am the producer and assistant director of <i>Stumblers</i>.</p>
<p>I am currently in my senior year at San Diego State University as a Television, Film and New Media Production major. I am a writer/director/producer and am so excited to be working on this project.</p>
<p>Ever since I was little, I have had a passion for the arts. From putting on plays for friends and family to doing school talent shows. I am incredibly honored to be producing and assistant directing. I love bringing stories to life on screen and working with actors, as I believe they are a crucial part of what makes or breaks a film.</p>
<p>I always aim to make and work on films that inspire me, and tell a bigger story than what meets the eye. This film does just that, as it has dynamic characters who are diverse and rarely represented on screen. In my career, I hope to improve representation for those who have been historically left out or misrepresented in Hollywood. This is a great start. </p>
<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to view our campaign! We can't wait to show you our film!</p>

<p> My name is Robert Carver. I am a senior San Diego State University and the Director of Photography for <i>Stumblers</i>. Filmmaking is my passion. Whether it’s films, documentaries, music videos, or videography/editing, I hope to experience the world through this drive I have to express myself visually. I hope to learn more about this world, its people, and myself through these experiences, and in turn become a better version of myself, a better friend/ family member, and a better filmmaker. </p>
<p>This film is important to me because of its diverse set of main characters. It’s important to have films about diverse main characters and their struggles as those people. Although I feel it’s just as important to have diverse main characters where their struggles don’t directly correlate to their diverse characteristics, as in <i>Stumblers</i>. Also I feel it’s going to be a fun time to watch characters that break stereotypes interact in a way that feels real. This means I’m going to have a lot of fun with the camera as well.</p>

<p>This film is incredibly important to us because it is about diversity and how under even the most dire circumstances, people can be brought together and find common ground.

<h3>The Documentary</h3>
<p>Dreama Walton, the subject of the film, is an ultra-marathon runner, full-time worker and a mom. She has to juggle so much in her schedule to be able to train and compete in races that are as long as 100 miles in under 30 hours. Yes, that's right - 100 miles. Dreama was offered a spot in The Western States 100, the oldest 100-mile race in the world, in Olympic Valley, California.</p>
<p>This story follows her training as she gets ready for Western States, but more importantly, it dives in to the life of Dreama, as we explore her motivation for entering willfully into struggle. Why would somebody ever sign up for something so difficult? What keeps her moving? Who are the people in her life that inspire her to continue running? How is she able to train for something so hard with so many other aspects of regular life seeking her attention?</p>
<p>Our goal is to create an 8-15 minute short documentary, that explores these questions, and culminates in her performance at The Western States 100 race this June 26th, 2021.</p>

<h3>Why Help</h3>

We also want to tell about how she received so much encouragement from so many strangers over the course of her life, and believe that by donating, you will be helping us help inspire others to do the same.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Documentary filmmaking is difficult. You have to be in the right place at the right time, and there is only one opportunity to ""get the shot"".</p>
<ul>
<li>There will be a lot of logistics planning as we look over the route, to see all the opportunities to film Dreama as she crosses our path during the race.</li>
<li>This is a non-stop, 100-mile race, that could take up to 30 hours. This means filming in the heat, filming in the weather, and filming at night. We will need to film in-between naps, and stay alert enough to get coverage of both Dreama, and her crew.</li>
<li>Amidst all this, we need to make sure we are getting the ""heart"" of the story, by spending time only on the worthwhile moments.</li>

Our immediate goal now is to raise that same amount in order to shoot the next third of the film in Arizona in August/September 2021. Last year, we raised about $14k, so it is our hope to raise the remaining $16k during this crowd fund! If we surpass this goal, fantastic *stretch goals*, these funds would go towards completing the final portions of INSPIRATION ROAD (2022).The plan is still to shoot in Arizona, California (and eventually South Dakota), which is very important to the story and unfortunately costs more than shooting in our backyards! ""It takes a village,"" a lot of resources and logistics to make an independent film: Cast, Crew (DP, Sound, Script Supervisor, Grips, Gaffers, PAs, Editors, Colorist, Sound Designer, Mixer, etc.), Locations Fees, Insurance, Equipment (Camera, Lenses, Grip Truck, Dolly, Audio, Drives, etc.), Transportation, Props, Costuming, Food, etc. Plus time, planning, and facilitating during pre-production, production, and post-production.

Foregoing a traditional casting process, I simply got on the phone, called my friends and colleagues and set to work crafting a story that showcases each actor’s range in a fun, dynamic way. They are all working for free, dedicating their time and considerable talents to making this project a top notch thriller of which we can all be proud!Eva Hamilton - Maisie Tackling the role of charismatic outlaw Maisie Jackson is magnetic leading lady Eva Hamilton. We're very excited to work with Eva and bring this dignified but dangerous woman to the screen!  Credits include ""Ruin Me,"" ""Death Kiss"" and ""Max Reload and the Nether Blasters""Cameron Kotecki - RiggsLast seen in Eminence Hill, the versatile actor leads Skinwalker’s cast as Nat Riggs, an idealistic young Marshall, tasked with the transport of a dangerous outlaw.  Cameron John Kotecki is an Arizona born actor, screenwriter and aspiring director. Credits include “Eminence Hill,”  “Senioritis,” and “Rhea.”Amelia Haberman - NellieOne of AZ’s most talented and prolific young actors, Amelia joins Skinwalker as Nellie, a young homesteader who calls the cursed mountain her home.  With performances ranging from the heartbreaking to the terrifying, Amelia has displayed her range time and again in such projects as “The Covenant,” “Krampus Origins,” “My Secret War,” and “The System.”Jeff Yazzie - Proud FistAZ Actor Jeff Yazzie takes charge as Proud Fist, the Native Warrior joining Storm Talker in a dangerous quest to restore peace to their mountain.  Credits include ""Eminence Hill"" ""Run for the High Country,"" and ""Out West""Victorio Pope - Storm TalkerAZ Actor Victorio Pope brings an intense complexity to the role of Storm Talker, a Native warrior tasked with a dangerous mission.  Credits include ""Eminence Hill"", ""Out West"" and ""Run for the High Country""Nathaniel Burns - BennyThe  role of “Benny,” a low down grave robber, will be played by AZ actor Nathaniel Burns. We can look forward to the raw humanity and intense presence Nathaniel brings to all of his roles.  Credits include “Eminence Hill,” “Battlefield 2025,” and “Krampus: the Reckoning.”Dan Higgins - BascomThe incomparable Dan Higgins hits the trail as tough-as-nails lawman, Marshall Bascom. Having last worked with Dan on “Breakdown Lane” in 2017, I’m thrilled to have him back to see him capture the grit and pathos of Bascom like no one else can.  Past credits include “Exit To Hell”, “The Encounter” and “There’s an Octopus in Your Head”Daniel Link - WillardTaking up the reins as Willard, a  Homesteader with a dark secret, is AZ actor Daniel Link. Daniel’s wide range brings just the right mixture of humanity and menace to this pivotal role in “Skinwalker.”  Daniel’s past credits include “Mind the Gap,” “Human Threads,” “The System” and “Krampus Unleashed.”William “Bill” Connor - HitchProlific and powerful AZ actor William “Bill” Connor portrays Vern in “Skinwalker.”  Bill’s strong screen presence and considerable talent make him the perfect choice to play this rugged outlaw with a heart of gold.  Bill’s credits include “Eminence Hill,” “Bloodthirst,” “Gearhead” and “Battlefield 2025.”  From Script to Screen By contributing to my campaign, you will be playing a pivotal role in bringing this film to life.

<strong>Thank you all for your continued support!!!</strong><br/><br/>Director's Note</h2>
<p>First of all, let me start by saying THANK YOU for even taking the time to hear our story! While doing a film about the anxiety of living with a loved one lost to suicide at any given moment can be triggering, I know this film is important because it gives visibility to the families that feel like they're alone. I know what it's like to plead with someone to want to live their life, pour love into them as much as you can, call every health care facility, behavioral therapist, holistic doctor - call anyone and everyone to try and find some solution but to only be met with a cycle of dead ends. The anxiety is constant but knowing you're not alone in this fight is so important and that is what this film provides.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1623191356/lf02opiluadsgbezs0le.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The film takes place in one day, where both tragedy and opportunity align. On the same day that our protagonist (LAMAR) is prepping for one of the biggest auditions of his career, he receives a phone call that his brother (DEVIN) might have committed suicide. Moments away from being called in to audition, Lamar must grapple with the fact that he might not see his brother alive and there's nothing that he can do to change that. He's sent on a rollercoaster of emotions the thought of losing his brother nearly breaks him. However, when the words of his monologue reflect his internal battle,  he finds a way to repurpose his trauma to ultimately nail his audition. In the end, this film explores the fact that despite our biggest adversities, it's within our nature to rise up and stay resilient. </p>

<p><strong>Logline: </strong>Robin faces his past from before the Teen Titans when a mysterious challenger appears, as a newly-arrived Starfire tries to make amends with her neglected older sister, Blackfire, who seeks the throne of their home planet, Tamaran.</p>
<p><strong>The Synopsis: </strong>An 18-year-old Robin has been leading the team known as the Teen Titans for three years now, through many a petty crime. Longing for their big moment, the Titans grow tired of Robin’s optimism.  However, when Robin finds a strange alien girl wearing in a purple dress and glowing green eyes, the lives of the team will change. After what seems like just another day on the job, now with the addition of Starfire, the team encounters Red X, which sends Robin on a journey to hunt this mysterious masked figure down. Now may be more than an opportunity than ever for the rest of the Titans to get the action they think they deserve, with Starfire's older vengeance-driven sister hot on her tail...</p>
<p>Our goal is to make a film that fans of any rendition of the Teen Titans can appreciate. From the original <i>Teen Titans </i>animated show, to <i>Teen Titans: GO!,  </i>to <i>Titans</i>, this is an even blend of cartoon humor with realistic action and themes. So no matter what your stance on each rendition is, this film will be something you can enjoy and take away from!</p>

<h3 data-unsp-sanitized=""clean"">The Gist</h3>
<p>Heyo, I'm Max. My background is extremely boring, so I'll keep it brief. I make stuff and think it has some semblance of value, so I'd like to make more stuff, but need some help.</p>
<p>This is the latest (and biggest, most challenging) bit of stuff I'm making: A live-action feature film about a young woman who learns why her actions make her feel the way they do (not to spoil it for you). It's a big ol' 90 minute therapy session that will hopefully make you very happy, and sad, and uncomfortable with how these emotions strike you, keeping in tune with that theme. That's what people like to feel during a movie, right? Uncomfortable?</p>
<p>I'd recommend watching the above video about the project, then this below sizzle I cut together using other film &amp; TV footage to convey the general tone &amp; approach:</p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/248811672?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><i>password: <strong>DATV</strong></i></div>
<div> </div>
</div><div>
<h3 data-unsp-sanitized=""clean"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We currently have over $40k dedicated to the project, and we need $30k more to push that uphill boulder over the top and get principal photography rolling.</p>
<p>We plan on getting this money, or at least a comparable amount, no matter what -- whether through investors, loans, and/or good ol' fashioned credit card suicide. But this is best way to do it. It gives us 100% creative control, significantly softens our debt (which will be helpful for the next inevitable project), and make it so the people who are genuinely interested in the movie are the ones involved, rather than people purely interested in finances.</p>
<p>What you'll be getting as a result is the movie itself + lots of bonus aspects to the production. They're mostly digital, rather than tangible perks like mugs &amp; hats, to ensure every dollar truly goes into the production itself. The tradeoff is that these digital perks are hopefully much more involving &amp; rewarding, such as credits in the film itself, a custom doodle, a script PDF, an advanced screener link, and a download of the soundtrack.</p>
</div><div>
<h3 data-unsp-sanitized=""clean"">The Team (so far)</h3>
<p align=""justify"">Conversations are taking place with a bunch of different people at the moment, but here are some of the ones that are locked in to be involved in some capacity:</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong><i>WRITER/DIRECTOR/PRODUCER/EDITOR</i></strong><strong> - MAX WERKMEISTER</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">Mr. Werkmeister was artificially grown in a petri dish over the course of 1968, mostly scraped together from the leftover remains of other lab samples across upstate New York. After a fifty-six year stint as the host of a ghost-hunting program for Freeform (then known as Fox Family), an existential crisis brought him back to the world of independent film.</p>
<p align=""justify"">That's when the drinking started.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Who can say why, in absence of a child, the best substitute for cradling is a bottle of Henny? Maybe it's the comparable smooth texture with the added security of a tough exterior. The only audible weeping coming from that of the cradler; the cradled's cries being replaced by soft swishes of the liquid therapy whose whispers promise to make one forget. Perhaps the greater question is -- why did he ever give it up?</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong><i>“DANNI”</i></strong><strong> - ALEXANDRA LANDAU</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">Ms. Landau got her start performing in Shakespearean productions as a child in the late 1590s, portraying deceased bodies and old crones, due to a rare, backward-aging condition. This condition was thought to simply be hideousness until the aging rapidly kicked in at the start of the new millennium. Now, with the little time she has left before becoming a baby, Ms. Landau has opted to take on a role more challenging than those of her heyday -- a spritely young adult.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong><i>PRODUCTION DESIGNER</i></strong><strong> - DANICA CAROTHERS</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">During the fall of 1998, a young girl named Carotha Danick went exploring through the harrowing Norwegian forests in pursuit of an unidentified satellite she had seen crashing down from the aurora borealis she'd been admiring earlier. Ms. Danick disappeared for the next six weeks, and, upon her miraculous return home, had changed her demeanor entirely. Insisting on now being called ""Danica Carothers"", she began a diet that consisted exclusively of rodents no lighter than two pounds and no heavier than four. This was just the beginning of an unsettling trend of erratic &amp; dangerous behaviors. While there is no hard evidence, it is widely speculated that something unknown has taken up residence inside Ms. Danick, and is waiting for the perfect time to come bursting out.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong><i>COMPOSER</i></strong><strong> - SEANDAN KELLY</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">The two-headed Mr. Kelly hails from the surliest of Irishmen, a stone-cold soul who’s hard to talk to without being assaulted by foul language, and harder to work alongside without being assaulted by even fouler blows. It took Max over 20 years to tame this beast in the workplace, an achievement he’s most proud of. As a result, the two have made beautiful music together, in a primarily nonsexual way.</p>
<p align=""justify""><strong><i>“MARGARET”</i></strong><strong> - CARON CLANCEY</strong></p>
<p align=""justify"">As a former elephant feeder, Ms. Caron “Ron” Clancey has grown very tired of the manipulation, the politics, and the yearly zoo conferences that got her to the top. As a result, she has chosen to take all the pain she’s harbored from this life and channel it into heart-wrenching performances. This film will be the first time she’s been on a set, eaten from a snack table, and seen a camera, if you don’t count the documentary crew that’s been following her since birth (she is the youngest of 16).</p>
</div><div>
<h3 data-unsp-sanitized=""clean"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>With filmmaking, every single day is packed with risks and challenges by virtue of the fact that collaboration + limited resources + limited time is a combination that invites them.</p>

Heyo, I'm Max. My background is extremely boring, so I'll keep it brief. I make stuff and think it has some semblance of value, so I'd like to make more stuff, but need some help.
This is the latest (and biggest, most challenging) bit of stuff I'm making: A live-action feature film about a young woman who learns why her actions make her feel the way they do (not to spoil it for you). It's a big ol' 90 minute therapy session that will hopefully make you very happy, and sad, and uncomfortable with how these emotions strike you, keeping in tune with that theme. That's what people like to feel during a movie, right? Uncomfortable?
I'd recommend watching the above video about the project, then this below sizzle I cut together using other film & TV footage to convey the general tone & approach:

password: DATV
 

What We Need & What You Get
We currently have over $40k dedicated to the project, and we need $30k more to push that uphill boulder over the top and get principal photography rolling.
We plan on getting this money, or at least a comparable amount, no matter what -- whether through investors, loans, and/or good ol' fashioned credit card suicide. But this is best way to do it. It gives us 100% creative control, significantly softens our debt (which will be helpful for the next inevitable project), and make it so the people who are genuinely interested in the movie are the ones involved, rather than people purely interested in finances.
What you'll be getting as a result is the movie itself + lots of bonus aspects to the production. They're mostly digital, rather than tangible perks like mugs & hats, to ensure every dollar truly goes into the production itself. The tradeoff is that these digital perks are hopefully much more involving & rewarding, such as credits in the film itself, a custom doodle, a script PDF, an advanced screener link, and a download of the soundtrack.

The Team (so far)
Conversations are taking place with a bunch of different people at the moment, but here are some of the ones that are locked in to be involved in some capacity:
WRITER/DIRECTOR/PRODUCER/EDITOR - MAX WERKMEISTER
Mr. Werkmeister was artificially grown in a petri dish over the course of 1968, mostly scraped together from the leftover remains of other lab samples across upstate New York. After a fifty-six year stint as the host of a ghost-hunting program for Freeform (then known as Fox Family), an existential crisis brought him back to the world of independent film.
That's when the drinking started.
Who can say why, in absence of a child, the best substitute for cradling is a bottle of Henny? Maybe it's the comparable smooth texture with the added security of a tough exterior. The only audible weeping coming from that of the cradler; the cradled's cries being replaced by soft swishes of the liquid therapy whose whispers promise to make one forget. Perhaps the greater question is -- why did he ever give it up?
“DANNI” - ALEXANDRA LANDAU
Ms. Landau got her start performing in Shakespearean productions as a child in the late 1590s, portraying deceased bodies and old crones, due to a rare, backward-aging condition. This condition was thought to simply be hideousness until the aging rapidly kicked in at the start of the new millennium. Now, with the little time she has left before becoming a baby, Ms. Landau has opted to take on a role more challenging than those of her heyday -- a spritely young adult.
PRODUCTION DESIGNER - DANICA CAROTHERS
During the fall of 1998, a young girl named Carotha Danick went exploring through the harrowing Norwegian forests in pursuit of an unidentified satellite she had seen crashing down from the aurora borealis she'd been admiring earlier. Ms. Danick disappeared for the next six weeks, and, upon her miraculous return home, had changed her demeanor entirely. Insisting on now being called ""Danica Carothers"", she began a diet that consisted exclusively of rodents no lighter than two pounds and no heavier than four. This was just the beginning of an unsettling trend of erratic & dangerous behaviors. While there is no hard evidence, it is widely speculated that something unknown has taken up residence inside Ms. Danick, and is waiting for the perfect time to come bursting out.
COMPOSER - SEANDAN KELLY
The two-headed Mr. Kelly hails from the surliest of Irishmen, a stone-cold soul who’s hard to talk to without being assaulted by foul language, and harder to work alongside without being assaulted by even fouler blows. It took Max over 20 years to tame this beast in the workplace, an achievement he’s most proud of. As a result, the two have made beautiful music together, in a primarily nonsexual way.
“MARGARET” - CARON CLANCEY
As a former elephant feeder, Ms. Caron “Ron” Clancey has grown very tired of the manipulation, the politics, and the yearly zoo conferences that got her to the top. As a result, she has chosen to take all the pain she’s harbored from this life and channel it into heart-wrenching performances. This film will be the first time she’s been on a set, eaten from a snack table, and seen a camera, if you don’t count the documentary crew that’s been following her since birth (she is the youngest of 16).

Risks & Challenges
With filmmaking, every single day is packed with risks and challenges by virtue of the fact that collaboration + limited resources + limited time is a combination that invites them.
With this project in particular, however, the story is a very ambitious scale for something with its limitations. It includes a healthy amount of practical effects and expensive locations in the middle of a hot California summer with a potentially unhealthy amount of hands on deck.
The attempt to overcome these challenges before they truly hit is for us to show up as prepared as possible, with contingency plans if anything doesn't work out within our given constraints. Every scene is being storyboarded and shot lists are being worked out weeks in advance, allowing for improvisation, rescheduling, and cuts for when they inevitably become necessary.

Other Ways You Can Help
Whether you're in a position to financially help or not, you can still:

Share this campaign with people online (and in LIFE) so they can get all stoked up
Contribute in a production role if you're a film person as eager and as desperate as us (crew/extras/graphics/etc.)
Spread the word to trustworthy friends who are the above ^

I hope you hop aboard our ship, if only to see whether or not it sinks. Either way, it'll be a real hoot of a ride. If you still have questions, reach out, and you'll get answers!Thank ya!",0.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>Writer/Actress - Gemma Harvey</strong></h3>
<p>There is a need in the entertainment industry for change and growth when it comes to casting and story, however sadly, this isn't always fulfilled.  As an actress I am often frustrated with the work out there for myself,  but rather than complain about the problem, I want to be part of the solution. My continuous work with award winning learning disabled theatre company, Access All Areas and autistic actor Julius Robertson, was my inspiration to write this film. Born from our genuine interactions, his honesty, humour and fresh look at the world compelled me to write something that doesn't just highlight a ""disability"" - but shows an everyday situation of unrequited love.</p>
<p>While we plan to work with friends and call in favours where we can, it’s not always possible to make a film freely or cheaply. After careful budgeting for equipment rentals, locations and looking after cast and crew properly, we are hoping to raise £8000.  We want the best possible film to be made and to see that money ‘up on the screen’ but have also factored in film festival costs, as the main objective is to raise awareness and for the film to be seen.  If we don’t reach our budget goal, we will still plan to make the film, maybe tightening our belts in certain areas, but also continuing to raise funds.</p>
<p>While making films isn't necessarily in the same realm as medical breakthroughs and saving lives, provoking change in the industry is still very important. Your donations are essential in making these changes happen.  Diversity may be the current word on everyone's lips, but this film will be an example for other learning disabled actors and allow them to see themselves being portrayed on screen in an accurate way.  </p>
<p>I am an actress first and foremost and will be acting opposite Jules in this film. I have partnered with a creative team who between them have decades of experience in various backgrounds through TV, film and theatre – a creative collaboration that won’t fail.</p>

<h3><strong>Why Colombia?</strong></h3>
<p>I (Phil Svitek) have a friend named Edgar who lives in Bogota and one of the main actresses is Colombian.

<h2>What is this story about?</h2>
<p><strong>All I Hear is Static</strong> is an absurdist/science fiction short film about a paranoid introvert named Blake who’s lack of belonging is exploited after a mysterious tube television appears on his porch. As Blake’s denials are ignored, and the tube television continues to reappear, its ominous origins come both further and farther into focus. </p>
<p>This story is a fictional retelling inspired by a true story. <strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qarzxkn3jAM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Don’t believe me?</a></strong></p>
<p>In 2018 in Henrico, Virginia over 60 families awoke to find vintage tube televisions left on their porch. Upon inspection of security footage, local authorities discovered an unknown deliverer dawning a television helmet dropping all of these tv's off with no explanation in the middle of the night. The assailant was never caught.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>Why do I want to tell this story?</h2>
<p>Absurdist tales have always been in my interest. For the last year all of us have had our lives changed permanently due to the pandemic. The isolation is what's stuck with me. Things have gotten better, and it's made me deeply appreciate the friends and family who've supported me. This film serves as an allegory for where that isolation can lead you without support. Although not fully comedic in tone, this film aims to be a trip through the uncanny valley explored through a satirical and artsy story, that you aren’t soon to forget.</p>
<h3>Where does the money go?</h3>
<p>Filmmaking is expensive. Even for student productions like this the costs can add up.  Your contributions help pay for cast and crew members, catering, gear, locations, production insurance, post production, film festival submissions, and marketing, and so much more.  </p>
<h3>What you get out of it?</h3>
<p>We have reward tiers set up so you get some exclusive goodies for supporting us. We're giving out perks like a Special Thanks in the credits of the film, digital Behind the Scenes Reel and Photo Access, Signed Copies of the script (from writer/director), Co-Producer, and Executive Producer credits, and for &gt;$100, you get entered into a raffle to receive one of three exclusive production props from the set as well as everything else!!</p>
<p><i>**All of our rewards will be disbursed/shipped at or after the Griffon Film Festival at Missouri Western State University in the late Spring of 2022. </i></p>

<p><strong>Spliff Temple</strong> is a band based out of Kansas City, Missouri. It consists of members (listed in order from left to right) Roswell, Mün, Saint Paul, and Saminull. They blend a variety of electronic styles and bring a unique sound to each piece they produce. The group has been making private and public works for the past five years, and is now branching further into soundtrack composition. Spliff Temple scored PMO PRODUCTION’s previous film, LITTLE FAVORS.They are excited to bring their unique soundscape to All I Hear is Static to enhance the experience.</p>
<p>How are we spending the $$$?</p>
<p>Despite us only asking for &gt;$3,500 dollars, our budget is actually closer to $9,000. We've raised over half of the funds already! But with your contributions we'll be able to afford all of the expenses listed below. Here's what our budget breakdown looks like: </p>
<p>$1,000 - <strong>Catering, snacks, and beverages. </strong></p>
<p>$750 - <strong>Industry Standard Sound Department Stipend</strong></p>
<p>$750 - <strong>Industry Standard Production Designer Stipend</strong></p>
<p>$1,700 - <strong>Camera Equipment Rentals &amp; Purchases</strong></p>
<p>$1,700 - <strong>Production Design, Props &amp; Wardrobe</strong></p>
<p>$500 - <strong>Location Rentals</strong></p>
<p>$300 - <strong>Transportations</strong></p>
<p>$500 - <strong>General Liability Production Insurance</strong></p>
<p>$500 - <strong>Industry Standard Post Audio Mixing</strong> </p>
<p>$1,250 - <strong>Marketing and Film Festival Submissions</strong></p>
<p><i>Barring unexpected expenditures, all funding collected that exceeds budget is to be distributed as crew stipends to various crew members currently signed on as deferred.</i></p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Covid 19 has rocked the world of cinema with our standards for safety and wellness. Thanks to the industry being pro-active, we have standards set in place to ensure everyone's safety and compliance with CDC guidelines. We aim for most cast/crew members to be vaccinated, and as a fail safe we will be checking temperatures and following social distancing protocols throughout the full duration of the set. </p>
<p>One of the most difficult challenges with student productions is the cost of production. Often times, no matter how much you believe in a project certain aspects come down to money.  Without it, you are left to sacrifice the production quality of the film, or you sacrifice the ability to take care of crew.</p>
<p>Charles and the PMO PRODUCTIONS team aims to cover both of these bases, and this is difficult task. As most of the crew are working for reduced or deferred rates, he aims to offer substantial meals and a professional set experience to boost the skills of everyone involved. Charles works on professional commercial and narrative projects and has seen first hand the quality of the industry. He is committed to maintaining those standards even with a student production. This allows fellow classmates and underclassmen a chance to advance their portfolios on a student film that sets its standards on par with productions that have multiple times the budget. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't donate, that doesn't mean you can't contribute. Sharing the campaign on your social media helps spread the word about the project and helps showcase all of the crew members that are diligently working on this short film. </p>
</div></div>","What is this story about?
All I Hear is Static is an absurdist/science fiction short film about a paranoid introvert named Blake who’s lack of belonging is exploited after a mysterious tube television appears on his porch. As Blake’s denials are ignored, and the tube television continues to reappear, its ominous origins come both further and farther into focus. 
This story is a fictional retelling inspired by a true story. Don’t believe me?
In 2018 in Henrico, Virginia over 60 families awoke to find vintage tube televisions left on their porch. Upon inspection of security footage, local authorities discovered an unknown deliverer dawning a television helmet dropping all of these tv's off with no explanation in the middle of the night. The assailant was never caught.

Why do I want to tell this story?
Absurdist tales have always been in my interest. For the last year all of us have had our lives changed permanently due to the pandemic. The isolation is what's stuck with me. Things have gotten better, and it's made me deeply appreciate the friends and family who've supported me. This film serves as an allegory for where that isolation can lead you without support. Although not fully comedic in tone, this film aims to be a trip through the uncanny valley explored through a satirical and artsy story, that you aren’t soon to forget.
Where does the money go?
Filmmaking is expensive. Even for student productions like this the costs can add up.  Your contributions help pay for cast and crew members, catering, gear, locations, production insurance, post production, film festival submissions, and marketing, and so much more.  
What you get out of it?
We have reward tiers set up so you get some exclusive goodies for supporting us. We're giving out perks like a Special Thanks in the credits of the film, digital Behind the Scenes Reel and Photo Access, Signed Copies of the script (from writer/director), Co-Producer, and Executive Producer credits, and for >$100, you get entered into a raffle to receive one of three exclusive production props from the set as well as everything else!!
**All of our rewards will be disbursed/shipped at or after the Griffon Film Festival at Missouri Western State University in the late Spring of 2022.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This is to help with an independent film that is planned for filming starting late September to December 2020. The movie is during the year 2050 when pollution, radiation and virus are rampant all over the world, and people needs to live with masks covering their faces. This story is about a serial killer is on the lose and the detectives need to catch the killer before it's too late. But they somehow ventured into a world of sorcery and witchcraft.</p>
<p>We opted to film this in Fall/Winter season as it helps increase production value for the film as well as having something for everyone to do during this slow seasons. We will be filming with at least 4 cameras (BMPCC4K and GH5, all using their highest quality standard) and breaking into different units. As this film's story evolves at evenings and night time, we opted to use mostly the Sirui's Anamorphic lenses.</p>
<p>Our crew for this project has been considered the all star members within the Cleveland/Akron film community while our Cast are seasonal veterans and we believed they will bring the story to life.</p>
<p>We have had very successful crowdfunding campaigns in the past and have also made several feature films that got distributions worldwide, our current feature film Wu Xia 2 The Code is now being distributed starting September 1st as <strong>Immortal Combat The Code</strong> by High Octane Picture,  it has been screen at many film festivals as well as being the recipient of Best Action Feature Film at the 2020 Indie Gathering and Film Festival, here's the current trailer for Immortal Combat the Code:</p>

<h3>The Impact and Concern</h3>
<p>We understand while living in the current pandemic world, film productions are needed to adapt and increase safety precautions to make sure all members of the project is protected and safe.</p>
<p>As an no/low budget independent filmmaker, me and my team have been championing production safety. It is our number one priority in the past and continued to be so now. We have created a detailed safety guidelines as well as having  a national pandemic team representative as part of our crew. We are also, perhaps, the first in Ohio's independent filmmakers that will include various type of face masks, face shields and others to be part of the set where cast will be wearing them as part of the story, while it may limit their facial expression, but it would be also a welcoming challenge that they've accepted to demonstrate how talented they are. Of course, we will follow CDC and State's recommendation and suggestions and constantly adapt as needed. While we can not guaranteed everyone would be 100% safe, like everything in life, there is always risk involved, and here, we are doing our best to make sure everyone's safety is our priority.</p>
<p>Suffice to say: <strong><i>We will do as much as we can to make sure everyone on set is safe and protected. While creating an opportunity for us to express our vision and creativity to make a compelling feature film. </i></strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As this is a crowdfunding, there always risk involved, however, we will keep it as minimal, and perhaps the worst it may happen is that due to CDC and State's Mandate, we may have to push it to 2021. As of now, we are still planned ahead.</p>
<p>Your contribution will help us finish our production that you will be proud of.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<h3>The Mixtape: A Live Comedy Concert Film</h3>
<p>My name is Taylor Moorey, and I am a comedian, writer, and musician based in Vancouver, Canada.</p>
<p>LINE-UP: Alisha Dhillon, Amanda Smith, Amber Harper-Young, Ed Konyha, Jake Spencer,  K.C. Novak, Kevin von Helvete, Kwasi Thomas, Robert Peng, Taylor Moorey</p>
<p>TICKETS: <a href=""https://admitone.com/events/mixtape-vancouver-7"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://admitone.com/events/mixtape-vancouver-7</a>...</p>
<p>Facebook event: <a href=""https://fb.me/e/C9YUDRJ5"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://fb.me/e/C9YUDRJ5</a></p>
<p>NEW: ANY DONOR WHO DONATES $50 OR MORE WILL BE GIVEN ONE FREE TICKET!</p>
<p>The Mixtape shoots November 19, live at the Biltmore Cabaret in Vancouver, British Columbia, and my aim with this project is to make an event out of a comedy special, in a time when every conceivable piece of art and entertainment is so ubiquitous as to be made boring among the ever-growing double-edged sword of streaming services. To that end, this live stand-up special will be part documentary on the challenges, hills, and valleys of independent comedy and art in Canada, and featuring some of Vancouver's top rising comedians. It will then be submitted to film festivals and theaters to bring this to a wide audience.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The total budget of this project is a modest $6, 500, including perk production costs. This pays for every facet including venue rental, security, comedians, our skeleton crew, gear rental, original music, film festival submissions, as well as merchandise production for Indiegogo perks, and more. Here is the full breakdown of costs:</p>
<p>SHOW COSTS: $5000<br/>Venue and security: $1100<br/>Gear Rental: $1000<br/>Comedians: $1650<br/>Crew: $400<br/>Original Music: $200<br/>Advertising: $250<br/>Film Festival Submissions: $400(x8)</p>
<p>Perk production is a huge variable, as items will be printed as needed, but each item has been priced to pay for its production, along with contributing to the project. Including Indiegogo's platform, transaction, and transfer fees, there is &lt;$1000 buffer for merchandise production.</p>
<p>If we go over any amount (in which case, oh my god, thank you), all money will go back into the project. If we fail to raise the full amount, we will go ahead with whatever we have, priority going to pay comics and crew. Here is a breakdown of bonus costs:<br/><br/>$6500-$8000 - these funds will go towards paying for a professional to mix and master the audio<br/>&gt;$8000 - these funds will towards paying a professional for colour correction<br/>&gt;$10 000 - these funds will go towards my inevitable hospital bills from glee-induced cardiac arrest (just kidding; bonuses for comedians and crew, and whatever else we can do to make this show better).</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Over the last year, everyone has lost so much, and had to conquer deeply disturbing hurdles - artists among them. In Vancouver, live stand-up comedy has suffered a lot - clubs have closed, businesses were lost, careers put on pause, or on the verge of imploding. And while music can be practised, mastered, recorded, and sold in a home studio, stand-up comedy, by its very nature, cannot. By contributing to this project, you are lending credence and legitimacy to aspiring professionals.</p>
<p>But perhaps more relevant than that, The Mixtape seeks to be a document in an ongoing battle within Canada. The Canadian arts sector is anemic, and sadly, has been for a long, long time. Our media is dominated by the US, and we lose a lot of our talent to them, understandably. More frustratingly, it is kept anemic by the government and large, risk-averse telecommunications corporations that monopolize the kind of media, art and performances that Canadians get to see, and interfere with or water down the creative goals. Whereas American entertainment is a blank slate, Canadian performing arts is kneecapped by the mandate: ""Uniquely Canadian"". Lastly, stand-up comedy is not considered a legitimate art form (by many), but most troublingly by the Canadian government. Therefore, this eliminates the ability to receive grants and other funding, as well as facing a confusing and extremely costly process in trying to get any work in the US while remaining a Canadian citizen. While the CASC (Canadian Associating of Stand-Up Comedians) has done amazing work in this direction, there is ever an uphill battle.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Any positive response to this campaign and movie are more than overwhelming for me, and I realize that despite having an amazing team of people with me, this is a lot of work I have never done before, and there are a lot of hurdles, but we will face them and rise to the challenge. I've never dealt with such a hurry-up-and-wait situation before, so let's also see the toll it takes on my mental health!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Money and time and resources are tight for everyone right now, so no sweat if you can't contribute. But if you could help share this with friends and family, that would be massively appreciated. To anyone who cares, I thank you from the bottom of my heart.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A quick note about perks: Any physical merchandise (posters, stickers, shirts) is expected to be fulfilled in October. Once the campaign ends, orders will be placed, and will be sent out as soon as possible.<br/>Thank-yous and roasts will be fulfilled by the end of September.<br/>Any film elements (completed cut, BTS material, stills, etc.) will be fulfilled April of next year, as I will need a few months to edit.</p>

<p>As graduating RTA Media Production students, our Thesis film is something we look forward to throughout the four years of our program. A chance to create a project we’re truly passionate about and assert our voices as artists and storytellers. The COVID-19 pandemic has completely turned the last year of our program upside down, forcing us all to adapt to collaborating virtually with the rest of the world. </p>
<p>Despite these challenges, we’ve spent the last 7 months in pre-production (100% virtually) for this film, writing and creating a nearly 700-page bible that includes schedules, budgets, storyboards, mood boards, costume &amp; set designs and <u>much</u> more. We begin production in September 2021 and plan to release the film in March of 2022, but we cannot do it without your help.</p>
<p>To make our vision a reality, we’re asking you to join us in putting all these plans into action to create this refreshing and poignant coming-of-age film.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Weeks before ageing out of the foster care system, 17-year old Kay falls into an electric friendship with Olivia, transforming the way they see themselves and their future. </strong></p>
<p>Dandelion Green is a coming-of-age short film that explores the friendship of two foster teens, who meet while placed in the same Toronto home. Kay, a non-binary, guarded teen, is weeks away from ageing out of the system. Olivia, a 16-year-old budding artist, acts as a support system for her mother, who suffers from mental illness. </p>
<p>When the two teens meet, they are instantly drawn to each other, and bond over their shared experiences in the foster care system. As Kay’s impending 18th birthday approaches, and as Olivia’s mother’s health improves, both teens are forced to make a difficult decision. </p>
<p>Inspired by the resilient stories of foster kids and our own friendships growing up, the film will challenge the idea of what family and ‘romantic’ relationships look like.</p>
<p>Toronto’s Little Italy and Annex neighbourhoods serve as the romantic backdrop to this intimate exploration of queer friendship, growing up, and the idea of ‘home’. </p>

<p>Over 12,000 minors are in foster care in Ontario (Canadian Child Welfare Research Portal), and according to studies, LGBTQ+ youth are at a higher risk of experiencing abuse and mental illness while in the system (Youth.Gov). Foster kids are all around us, but their stories are rarely told. With Dandelion Green, we aim to explore the stories of foster kids respectively, in order to give them a voice. Our goal is for youth in foster care to see Dandelion Green and recognize pieces of themselves on screen.</p>
</div><div>
<p>When we see people that remind us of ourselves represented in the media, we feel more confident in our identities. By placing queer foster kids at the heart of this story, we aim to provide that representation. Kay and Olivia’s individual queer identities are not the driving forces of the film, as we believe that it’s important that stories about queer characters go beyond the traditional coming-out narrative. Just as their experiences in the foster care system do not define them, neither do their queer identities. They are simply one aspect of their evolving identities, explored in this coming-of-age story.</p>
<p>Dandelion Green is a teenage exploration of home, growing up, and the unexpected ways your friends shape you. In this short coming-of-age film, we hope to accomplish certain goals.</p>

<p>At the moment, our biggest risk and challenge is the <strong>Covid-19 Pandemic</strong>. With safety at the highest priority level, we are determined to keep our cast and crew safe while creating a beautiful and authentic film.</p>
<p>We have created an in-depth safety plan following provincial and federal guidelines to ensure on-set safety for the duration of our shoot.

(n) a state of unease or generational dissatisfaction with life
When a suicidal woman is exposed to the stark reality of someone taking their own life,she begins to question her own 
""We're making this film to give Asian women suffering from 
hidden mental health issues a voice"" - Yennis Cheung & team
Haunted by intrusive nightmares and flashbacks for the past three years, Lucia Leung, a Chinese immigrant in London, struggles with post-traumatic stress disorder. Despite having no one who understands her mental illness - not even her husband - she soldiers on with life. However, she starts to lose control of her brain, and her loneliness grows stronger.
Lucia’s pain, invisible to others, becomes unbearable. Living in a cosmopolitan city with a loving husband and a high-flying career no longer has meaning. Her mental illness chips away at her identity; she cannot see the end of the tunnel.
Just when Lucia decides to end her life, she witnesses another woman’s suicide in broad daylight. This woman, who’s also Chinese, lies dead on the road after getting hit by a car. ""That should be me,” Lucia whispers to herself.
Witnessing this incident puts Lucia into a weird trance; she finds herself talking to the deceased’s spirit.The departed’s name is Janet, and despite their drastically different personalities, the two Chinese women's circumstances are similar. In their conversation, Lucia learns about Janet's abusive father and partner, and Janet learns about Lucia's suffering.
Janet shares with Lucia the Buddhist practice she uses to manage her adversities, and the two bond over their common culture.
Just when Lucia thinks she’s finally found someone to talk to, she realises Janet is merely a mirror of her imagination.
Nevertheless, this surreal encounter allows Lucia to realise that maybe the most effective way to relieve her suffering is to let go of her desire to control the negative intrusions in her brain and hold on to the happy moments, no matter how minute they are. Maybe she can learn to find comfort within herself.

<p><strong>Plot Overview</strong></p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""> </h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>WHAT IS <i>DANGEROUS</i>?</strong></h2>
<p><i>Dangerous</i> is an award-winning neo-noir Western set in Southern Appalachia. <i>Dangerous</i> is a modern myth filled with heroes, villains, and important lessons. After all, <i>Dangerous </i>is a modern-interpretation of the Labors of Theseus. <i>Dangerous</i> is a lot of things, but at its core, <i>Dangerous </i>is an intense action adventure that will have you on the edge of your seat, and leave you begging for more!</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1626137771/antctsgpsmb42asmzygf.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
</div><div>
<p>The story of <i>Dangerous</i> revolves around two characters and the choices they have to make if they’re going to survive the night at the Procter Motel. </p>
<p><strong>Theo Troezen </strong>is a motorcycle riding cowboy on a mysterious quest for justice. After receiving a prophecy that he will use all six bullets in his Father’s revolver, Theo is determined to use them on evildoers. After all, an eye for an eye, right?</p>
<p><strong>Lilly Procter</strong> is a young woman who acts tough, but is trapped in a terrible situation and forced to commit unspeakable acts by her abuser, her “sweet-as-pie” Aunt Polly.</p>
<p><strong>Polly Procter</strong>, the villain of our story, is a southern belle and wicked serial killer. She’s determined to deal her own form of justice, luring men to stay at her motel then seducing, torturing, and murdering them. </p>
<p>Theo will have to decide if his ideals are worth clinging on to, and Lilly will have to choose to escape the situation she’s in, even if it means more danger. </p>
<p>Dangerous takes its inspiration from myth and legend, but also many of your favorite movies and television shows. Check it out!</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1626137840/ghsl0wvgiikhfhsjthqf.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">WHAT WE NEED</h2>
<p><i>Dangerous</i> aims to earn as much acclaim as a film as it has earned as a script. To do this, <i>Dangerous </i>needs to raise a total of $60,000.</p>
<p>As you can see in the graphic below, <i>Dangerous</i> aims to put the majority of its budget into production. From the unsettlingly prim design of the Procter Motel to Theo’s iconic revolver, the budget for <i>Dangerous</i> will appear on screen for viewers to enjoy. Currently, <i>Dangerous </i>plans to shoot in New Mexico, so funds donated in our campaign will go to travel, lodging, and food for our talented cast and crew. Furthermore, it is important to us to pay all of our cast and crew a fair rate. It's not enough to make our film; we want to do it <i>right</i>. </p>

</div></div>","WHAT IS DANGEROUS?
Dangerous is an award-winning neo-noir Western set in Southern Appalachia. Dangerous is a modern myth filled with heroes, villains, and important lessons. After all, Dangerous is a modern-interpretation of the Labors of Theseus. Dangerous is a lot of things, but at its core, Dangerous is an intense action adventure that will have you on the edge of your seat, and leave you begging for more!


The story of Dangerous revolves around two characters and the choices they have to make if they’re going to survive the night at the Procter Motel. 
Theo Troezen is a motorcycle riding cowboy on a mysterious quest for justice. After receiving a prophecy that he will use all six bullets in his Father’s revolver, Theo is determined to use them on evildoers. After all, an eye for an eye, right?
Lilly Procter is a young woman who acts tough, but is trapped in a terrible situation and forced to commit unspeakable acts by her abuser, her “sweet-as-pie” Aunt Polly.
Polly Procter, the villain of our story, is a southern belle and wicked serial killer. She’s determined to deal her own form of justice, luring men to stay at her motel then seducing, torturing, and murdering them. 
Theo will have to decide if his ideals are worth clinging on to, and Lilly will have to choose to escape the situation she’s in, even if it means more danger. 
Dangerous takes its inspiration from myth and legend, but also many of your favorite movies and television shows. Check it out!

WHAT WE NEED
Dangerous aims to earn as much acclaim as a film as it has earned as a script. To do this, Dangerous needs to raise a total of $60,000.
As you can see in the graphic below, Dangerous aims to put the majority of its budget into production. From the unsettlingly prim design of the Procter Motel to Theo’s iconic revolver, the budget for Dangerous will appear on screen for viewers to enjoy. Currently, Dangerous plans to shoot in New Mexico, so funds donated in our campaign will go to travel, lodging, and food for our talented cast and crew. Furthermore, it is important to us to pay all of our cast and crew a fair rate. It's not enough to make our film; we want to do it right. 

PERKS & HOW YOU CAN HELP

<h3>Welcome to the Cave!</h3>
<p>We're making another film and this time we want to invite you to be part of the journey. We're expanding our production in multiple departments and with your help it's going be a bloody good time. </p>
<h3>Ba'al Out</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Recently unemployed and frustrated with where his life is headed, a debt burdened millennial’s future is at a crossroad. On his search for truth he finds himself on the spiritual battleground with an ancient archon.</p>
<p>This is going to be a short story that we intend to build upon as a launching pad for a rich immersive world that will expand over time. We're going to be bringing in some top tier talent that has just as much love for the horror genre as we do. We will be showcasing the folks helping bring the project to life throughout the duration of the campaign.</p>
<p>This project is estimated to cost roughly $4,000. If we can raise half of that we would be in great shape for being able to finance the film without selling our soul to Ba'al. </p>
<p>Here are a couple specific areas that we intended to allocate campaign funds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creature design - We have killer concept for manifesting Ba'al, but it's going to cost roughly a quarter of our budget to have it done right. The demon's share of the funding will go to costuming including the wardrobe, masking, make-up, and prosthetics.</li>
<li>Casting - We're brining in seasoned actors with a genuine passion for the genre and we're going to compensate them accordingly. </li>
<li>Crew - Our crew support the cause as a labor of love, but their technical expertise deserves just as much credit and compensation as the acting talent.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

<p>For those who may not be familiar, Cave House Studios has been around since 2005.

All of our projects have been successfully completed on time and within the budget we had in our pockets.</p>
<p>Yes we're scaling up a little with this project, but in a very manageable way with folks who we have established solid relationships. There are little to no foreseeable risks with our project, aside from eternal damnation. If we don't hit our fundraising goals we'll simply charge it to the debt collectors and hope we get <i>Ba'al'd Out</i> down the road. Ba'al WILL BE released from his dark chamber and he asks that you join him for his reign of terror.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Short Summary</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>WHEN WE FACE BEREAVEMENT, HOW DO WE MOVE ON?</i></p>
<p>On top of the pandemic, I was faced with the horrifying act of finding a missing friend from my LGBTQIA+ circle. I was worried. We all were. Our friend had a history of suicide in their family and the pandemic shook their mental wellbeing. The spectrum of heavy emotions wasn't the only challenge. It also occurred when I requested to file a missing persons report. the police officer asked, ""what if they don't want to be found?""</p>
<p>This line tortured me for days. I kept wondering on repeat, “what if I called and checked on them more?” I was heartbroken. Simultaneously, I kept seeing strange clouds that resembled UFOs. It was all too eerie. It was as if a bigger message was trying to come through…</p>
<p>Suicide and mental health are not foreign topics for LGBTQIA+ folx. Most of the time, we only hear about the individual who had suffered or who passed. What about the loved ones who are left behind? The loss creates a fractured mirror, reflecting their grief like ghosts that haunt us.</p>
<p>Although my friend was thankfully found, they left an indelible mark on me. It was a mark of trauma and a mark of healing, resilience, and eventually hope. I'm grateful I had support to move through this challenging time, but I often think about the people who don't have access to therapy or bereavement groups. Where do they turn to when all hope seems lost?</p>
<p>This is <i>Found</i>. A sci-fi story of LGBTQIA+ mental awareness and those who are left behind. With a majority queer womxn creative team, we aim to tell a universal story of bereavement: of finding, forgiving and committing to yourself after adversity. and by doing so, reclaiming your inner peace.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Story</h3>
<p>Rowan is grieving.</p>
<p>We meeting Rowan in her car, holding a bouquet of white roses and chugging her flask. There's a photograph a  woman on her dash--and a looming UFO in the sky. From the car radio, we learn it's the first anniversary of seven UFOs appearing across the world. To this day, no one knows what or why they're here.</p>
<p>A phone call interrupts, it's Rowan's friend and she's  PANICKED.  Their friend Sadie has been missing after switching her depressants two week ago. </p>
<p>After a series of lost calls, Rowan finally gets connected with the police. She tries to file a missing persons report but the officer chillingly responds, ""when they go missing, they don't want to be found.""</p>
<p>Suddenly, there's a deafening silence that grows into an otherworldly sound. Rowan tries to escape but <i>something</i> forces her body to drive toward the UFO. Once she arrives at the craft, Rowan surrenders to a fate darker than her grief. She lies down under UFO. Intense BRIGHT LIGHTS shine on her skin--</p>
<p>Rowan wakes up to a surprisingly peaceful scenery and a WOMAN-- the same woman from the dash photograph. It's JILL, her partner who went missing over a year ago. Jill tells Rowan that ""they wanted to find you."" Jill confesses ""It didn't matter how much you loved me. When I left, that was on me. Not you."" Rowan sobs. This is what she needed to hear. After their goodbye, the intense lights shine on them, climaxing to a blackout.</p>
<p>When Rowan gets back to her car, her skin strangely starts to glow. She finally found what she was looking for: peace within.... and a phone call from Sadie.</p>

Short Summary
WHEN WE FACE BEREAVEMENT, HOW DO WE MOVE ON?
On top of the pandemic, I was faced with the horrifying act of finding a missing friend from my LGBTQIA+ circle. I was worried. We all were. Our friend had a history of suicide in their family and the pandemic shook their mental wellbeing. The spectrum of heavy emotions wasn't the only challenge. It also occurred when I requested to file a missing persons report. the police officer asked, ""what if they don't want to be found?""
This line tortured me for days. I kept wondering on repeat, “what if I called and checked on them more?” I was heartbroken. Simultaneously, I kept seeing strange clouds that resembled UFOs. It was all too eerie. It was as if a bigger message was trying to come through…
Suicide and mental health are not foreign topics for LGBTQIA+ folx. Most of the time, we only hear about the individual who had suffered or who passed. What about the loved ones who are left behind? The loss creates a fractured mirror, reflecting their grief like ghosts that haunt us.
Although my friend was thankfully found, they left an indelible mark on me. It was a mark of trauma and a mark of healing, resilience, and eventually hope. I'm grateful I had support to move through this challenging time, but I often think about the people who don't have access to therapy or bereavement groups. Where do they turn to when all hope seems lost?
This is Found. A sci-fi story of LGBTQIA+ mental awareness and those who are left behind. With a majority queer womxn creative team, we aim to tell a universal story of bereavement: of finding, forgiving and committing to yourself after adversity. and by doing so, reclaiming your inner peace.
The Story
Rowan is grieving.
We meeting Rowan in her car, holding a bouquet of white roses and chugging her flask. There's a photograph a  woman on her dash--and a looming UFO in the sky. From the car radio, we learn it's the first anniversary of seven UFOs appearing across the world. To this day, no one knows what or why they're here.
A phone call interrupts, it's Rowan's friend and she's  PANICKED.  Their friend Sadie has been missing after switching her depressants two week ago. 
After a series of lost calls, Rowan finally gets connected with the police. She tries to file a missing persons report but the officer chillingly responds, ""when they go missing, they don't want to be found.""
Suddenly, there's a deafening silence that grows into an otherworldly sound. Rowan tries to escape but something forces her body to drive toward the UFO. Once she arrives at the craft, Rowan surrenders to a fate darker than her grief. She lies down under UFO. Intense BRIGHT LIGHTS shine on her skin--
Rowan wakes up to a surprisingly peaceful scenery and a WOMAN-- the same woman from the dash photograph. It's JILL, her partner who went missing over a year ago. Jill tells Rowan that ""they wanted to find you."" Jill confesses ""It didn't matter how much you loved me. When I left, that was on me. Not you."" Rowan sobs. This is what she needed to hear. After their goodbye, the intense lights shine on them, climaxing to a blackout.
When Rowan gets back to her car, her skin strangely starts to glow. She finally found what she was looking for: peace within.... and a phone call from Sadie.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div><p>You can be a key part of the movement to improve higher education by raising awareness of the appalling conditions under which the non-tenured majority of faculty, in spite of their love of teaching, struggle to teach--and students try to learn. You can join in the brave work being done to address the issues and make conditions better. It's my fervent hope that through raising awareness we can persuade both campus and public of the urgent need for solutions. Through these solutions, future faculty, students and societies will reap the benefits of a fair and high-quality education system. An improved system will not only more effectively prepare students for the jobs of the future, but will develop the creative and critical thinking skills we need in our leaders and our citizen voters in this new age of demagogues.</p></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have already faced down many challenges, including false stereotypes of professors, misleading and well-guarded branding by our institutions, opposition from conservative and reactionary elements. We've also had to grapple with the risks that unfortunately must be taken by precarious faculty who dare to speak out about their experiences: a few of our interview subjects, fearing repercussions from administrators, have even worn masks or asked that their faces be digitally rendered unrecognizable. We will doubtless meet the challenges to come in finishing this film--a project which is so important to our team. And we have the team to do that: alongside my many years as a university teacher and activist, I have worked as director and producer in film and theatre for most of my life and been recognized with numerous awards, including Canada Council Artist Awards and a place in Edmonton's Cultural Hall of Fame. And my teammates have even more professional experience and recognition than I do.</p>

<h3>Me and My Film...</h3>
<p>My name is Roxy. I am a student filmmaker who is passionate about animal and climate activism. I have a first-class honours degree in BSc Zoology (INT) and am now enrolled on the UWE MA in Wildlife Filmmaking. Alongside my studies, I have utilised social media, with my personal brand @roxythezoologist, to share stories about wildlife and conservation, to encourage others to reconnect with the natural world.</p>
<p>When I was 10 I visited Borneo with my family and saw orangutans in the wild and fell in love with them. Upon returning home, I promised my family that one day I would return to help save them. Now, at 24, that time has come.</p>
<p>In June, (<i>NOTE - this date may be pushed back due to covid-19</i>) I will be travelling to the Leuser Ecosystem, in Sumatra, to make a film, to try to help save Sumatran orangutans. Last year alone up to 3,000 orangutans were shot, as the result of human-wildlife conflict. This conflict is on the rise as orangutan's home continues to be diminished for palm oil, pulp, paper, and road development, forcing them to forage elsewhere. A particular favourite food of theirs is durian (a fruit seen as a delicacy throughout Asia). But the farmers do not like this 'crop-raiding', as it is a loss of livelihood for them, so they retaliate, as they have not been shown an alternative solution. In my film, I will be teaming up with a local ranger named Jasson to highlight the workshops that he runs within the local community; a proven solution that I intend to support to become more widely implemented, enabling humans and wildlife to live and thrive alongside one another for years to come</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Why Now?</h3>
<p>There are only 14,500 Sumatran orangutans remaining, 90% of which call the Leuser Ecosystem their home. This ecosystem is also the only remaining place on earth where orangutans, elephants, rhinos, sun bears, and tigers still co-exist. 4 million people living alongside it rely on the ecosystem services that it provides and, globally, it acts as a critical carbon sink. However, this ecosystem is being destroyed at an unprecedented rate. Up to 2 million hectares of it have already been lost and turned into agricultural or urbanised land.</p>
<p>As the Leuser Ecosystem continues to be destroyed, more and more animals are lost forever. Orangutans are critical for the functioning of this ecosystem, acting as 'gardeners of the forest', dispersing seeds over great distances, so the loss of them as a species would have a knock-on effect on many other taxa. As their home continues to be destroyed, they are forced to adapt and find other ways of surviving. Seemingly luckily for them, they exhibit great ecological flexibility and are able to survive off of monocultural (single-crop) plantations. A particular favourite of theirs is durian. However, this poses yet another risk to their life.</p>
<p>Human-orangutan conflict is increasing and despite their protected status, this conflict goes unpunished, due to a lack of law enforcement. Orangutans are killed for food, the illegal pet trade, and due to agricultural conflict. I will be aiming to offer a form of resolution to this agricultural conflict with my film. A study of over 800 farmers in Sumatra (Campbell-Smith <i>et al.</i>, 2010) revealed that they are afraid of orangutan and receive no help, so don't know any alternative way of resolving the conflict, other than by shooting at them. But there IS a solution to this. A solution which Jasson has created and has proven to work.</p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get...</h3>
<p>I am receiving no external funding for this film, so, as a student and first-time filmmaker, I literally cannot make this film and achieve my mission of helping to save the orangutans, without your support. So from the bottom of my heart, I want to thank you in advance for any support you are able to give, and I can't wait to be able to share this journey with you.</p>
<p>If, like me, you are shocked at how much it costs to create a film, I have created an infographic explaining my budget (see below) to clearly demonstrate where the costs for the film are going. The majority of the costs fall in obtaining visas and permits for filming within the national park, travel, filming alongside the rangers, running workshops for the local people, indiegogo fees, and marketing for the film (to ensure that as many people as possible will see 'One Step Beyond', maximising the positive impact that it will have).</p>

<p>However, there is good news - donations also come with perks, as a token of my gratitude for your support with my project!</p>
<p>Rewards range from social media shout-outs, to photography prints, to invites to a screening, to a named credit in the final film. Full details on rewards can be found in the panel to the right-hand side of this main body of text.</p>
<p>There are even some limited one-off rewards, kindly donated by some amazing people that I know, including a tattoo, plant-based nutrition consultation, and eco-friendly t-shirts!</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Even if you are unable to contribute financially, there is so much more you can do to help: please share this with your friends, family, colleagues...anyone you know, and help me to raise awareness about this cause and this project. Anything you can do to help will be greatly appreciated.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Concept in Detail...</h3>
<p>In this presenter-led documentary, I will travel to Sumatra to join Jasson, a local ranger from Batu Rongring. Set within the extremely biodiverse Leuser Ecosystem, the viewer will be taken on a journey of beauty, sadness, and hope: from witnessing these beings in their natural habitat, to viewing the conflict they experience, to ending with a long-term solution by running a cannon-making workshop for the local farmers.</p>
<p>This is a story about local people, following a team of rangers, and the farmers that live along the border of the national park. Some farmers have said they feel hurt about how much support goes to orangutan conservation, when they themselves are living on less than $2 per day. They are afraid, they are given no help, and they are desperately searching for a solution. </p>
<p>I will be highlighting Jasson's long-term solution for human-wildlife conflict mitigation. I want the film to encourage viewers to take action to support them as well, remembering that activism works, and that each of us can make a difference.</p>

<h3>The Impact...</h3>
<p>I really want this film to have a long lasting impact for the conservation of this beautiful species.</p>
<p>I believe that outreach and storytelling goes hand-in-hand and that for a story hoping to inspire change to be a success, there has to be a creative digital strategy to run alongside the film. As such, I will be distributing this film and its surrounding content as far and wide as I possible can.</p>
<p>My main goals are to:</p>
<p>- Inspire people to make positive changes.</p>
<p>- Instill hope for the future of wildlife conservation.</p>
<p>- Provide a long-term solution to local people.</p>
<p>- Help to buy an area of protected land which will restrict government development in the ecosystem.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Follow My Journey...</h3>
<p>Throughout the creation of my film, I will be posting regular updates, BTS (behind the scenes) clips, and other short-form content, on my social media pages to ensure you come with me every step of the way on this journey to making this film a reality! This social media content will not only highlight the beautiful animals that I encounter, but also the local people who need our support, and delve deeper into the process of running a successful conservation initiative that provides a long-term solution.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges...</h3>
<p>Given the current state of the planet, there are possible risks to the project that could be potentially hard to avoid. Currently, the biggest risk to the project is corona virus. Many of us are now in self isolation and global travel has been seriously limited. I am hoping that by June, things will have cleared up and that the trip can still go ahead as planned. However, if this is not the case, I can push filming right back into August or even postpone until the following durian season in November/December if needed. Whatever happens, I will still make this film.</p>

My name is Roxy. I am a student filmmaker who is passionate about animal and climate activism. I have a first-class honours degree in BSc Zoology (INT) and am now enrolled on the UWE MA in Wildlife Filmmaking. Alongside my studies, I have utilised social media, with my personal brand @roxythezoologist, to share stories about wildlife and conservation, to encourage others to reconnect with the natural world.
When I was 10 I visited Borneo with my family and saw orangutans in the wild and fell in love with them. Upon returning home, I promised my family that one day I would return to help save them. Now, at 24, that time has come.
In June, (NOTE - this date may be pushed back due to covid-19) I will be travelling to the Leuser Ecosystem, in Sumatra, to make a film, to try to help save Sumatran orangutans. Last year alone up to 3,000 orangutans were shot, as the result of human-wildlife conflict. This conflict is on the rise as orangutan's home continues to be diminished for palm oil, pulp, paper, and road development, forcing them to forage elsewhere. A particular favourite food of theirs is durian (a fruit seen as a delicacy throughout Asia). But the farmers do not like this 'crop-raiding', as it is a loss of livelihood for them, so they retaliate, as they have not been shown an alternative solution. In my film, I will be teaming up with a local ranger named Jasson to highlight the workshops that he runs within the local community; a proven solution that I intend to support to become more widely implemented, enabling humans and wildlife to live and thrive alongside one another for years to come

<h3>What is this film about? </h3>
<p>ATMWOB is an LGBTQ sci-fi short film set in Scotland. It's about a man named Ricky, who travels to a parallel universe in search of his boyfriend, Adam. The only problem is that he only has ten minutes before his body will shut down, so in that time he has to convince the alternative version of Adam to travel back to his own universe.</p>
<p>It's a story deeply rooted in the hard sci-fi genre, using hypothetical technology within the universe to explore the themes and ideas we want to express. In this case, the film centers around the issue of grief, using interdimensional travel as a way of bringing a grieving couple back together, and exploring what that dynamic would be like. LGBTQ sci-fi is a genre that is severely underrepresented, not just in mainstream cinema and TV, but also in the indie world. With your help we can help change this fact and make a film that is honest, bold and exciting.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why do we need your help? </h3>
<p>In an ideal world (or universe for that matter) we would be able to shoot this film for absolutely nothing and just put it out for the world to enjoy.  Believe me when I say that we have tried that before, numerous times in fact. The reality however is that we need people's support to get our film both made and seen. </p>
<p>People like yourself! We need your help to make what we believe to be a truly unique short film in a world cluttered by rehashed and play-it-safe ideas. However big or small a contribution you can make, whether that be simply getting involved with our social media, or making a financial contribution, we would really, really value your support.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Exactly how much money do we need?</h3>
<p>In order to make this project fully come to life, we hope to raise up to £6,000 GBP. Ambitious, yes, but we really believe in this project and that number represents our total commitment and faith in this film.</p>
<p>Our talented team of producers have managed to minimise the budget by using most of our own equipment and by relying on the ultimate holy grail of indie filmmaking: favours! However, there are still essential costs that must be accounted for before we can start rolling. These include locations, transportation, food, production design, props, makeup, wardrobe, and of course, the cast and crew.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as well as making sure our cast and crew are well-fed, warm and can get home safe and sound, we also have to ensure that we have enough money leftover for the post-production process. This includes a professional score, a fine-tuned sound mix, colour grading and the obligatory film festival costs so that this short can be seen by as many people as possible. Because of course, every film needs to find its audience and we want our film to find its own as well.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our intended goal, we still have contingency plans in place to get the film made on a more minimal budget. After all, it's as much about the people and the talent involved in this project and not the budget alone. But, of course, having a reasonable budget would be an ideal situation and that is our goal.</p>

<h3>Who the hell is Hamish Robertson? </h3>
<p>Hamish Robertson is the writer and director of A Trillion Miles West of Bradford (or ATMWOB for short).</p>
<p>As you saw in the video above, I'm not an actor, nor am I someone who can travel through dimensions, much to my disappointment. I'm just a passionate filmmaker who wants to make a really good movie. That's the ultimate goal here and if I'm being completely honest with you, I just want to make something unique and interesting that people will ultimately enjoy.</p>
<p>Roughly two years ago, I graduated from university with the goal of only making films that I am truly passionate about. Last year I made a short thriller called Hideous that I'm extremely proud of, which did well among the festivals and critics we managed to get it seen to. Since then, I've been busy writing and preparing ATMWOB, and we are now ready to get this film made. </p>
<p>This autumn, alongside an incredibly talented and motivated team, I'm hoping to use all the skills I've learned over the years to make a really compelling sci-fi short that focuses on the human drama above all else.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Meet the crew</h3>
<p>We will be updating our crew list over the course of the campaign and look forward to introducing you to more of the talented team we have at our disposal! </p>

<h3>And once it's all done? </h3>
<p>Once the film is complete, we would love if you'd join us in Glasgow for a cheeky White Russian. Truly, it's our hope that you can join us on the journey of helping this film find its audience.

ATMWOB is an LGBTQ sci-fi short film set in Scotland. It's about a man named Ricky, who travels to a parallel universe in search of his boyfriend, Adam. The only problem is that he only has ten minutes before his body will shut down, so in that time he has to convince the alternative version of Adam to travel back to his own universe.
It's a story deeply rooted in the hard sci-fi genre, using hypothetical technology within the universe to explore the themes and ideas we want to express. In this case, the film centers around the issue of grief, using interdimensional travel as a way of bringing a grieving couple back together, and exploring what that dynamic would be like. LGBTQ sci-fi is a genre that is severely underrepresented, not just in mainstream cinema and TV, but also in the indie world. With your help we can help change this fact and make a film that is honest, bold and exciting.
 
Why do we need your help? 
In an ideal world (or universe for that matter) we would be able to shoot this film for absolutely nothing and just put it out for the world to enjoy.  Believe me when I say that we have tried that before, numerous times in fact. The reality however is that we need people's support to get our film both made and seen. 
People like yourself! We need your help to make what we believe to be a truly unique short film in a world cluttered by rehashed and play-it-safe ideas. However big or small a contribution you can make, whether that be simply getting involved with our social media, or making a financial contribution, we would really, really value your support.
 

Exactly how much money do we need?
In order to make this project fully come to life, we hope to raise up to £6,000 GBP. Ambitious, yes, but we really believe in this project and that number represents our total commitment and faith in this film.
Our talented team of producers have managed to minimise the budget by using most of our own equipment and by relying on the ultimate holy grail of indie filmmaking: favours! However, there are still essential costs that must be accounted for before we can start rolling. These include locations, transportation, food, production design, props, makeup, wardrobe, and of course, the cast and crew.
Furthermore, as well as making sure our cast and crew are well-fed, warm and can get home safe and sound, we also have to ensure that we have enough money leftover for the post-production process. This includes a professional score, a fine-tuned sound mix, colour grading and the obligatory film festival costs so that this short can be seen by as many people as possible. Because of course, every film needs to find its audience and we want our film to find its own as well.
If we don't reach our intended goal, we still have contingency plans in place to get the film made on a more minimal budget. After all, it's as much about the people and the talent involved in this project and not the budget alone. But, of course, having a reasonable budget would be an ideal situation and that is our goal.
 

 
 
Who the hell is Hamish Robertson? 
Hamish Robertson is the writer and director of A Trillion Miles West of Bradford (or ATMWOB for short).
As you saw in the video above, I'm not an actor, nor am I someone who can travel through dimensions, much to my disappointment. I'm just a passionate filmmaker who wants to make a really good movie. That's the ultimate goal here and if I'm being completely honest with you, I just want to make something unique and interesting that people will ultimately enjoy.
Roughly two years ago, I graduated from university with the goal of only making films that I am truly passionate about. Last year I made a short thriller called Hideous that I'm extremely proud of, which did well among the festivals and critics we managed to get it seen to. Since then, I've been busy writing and preparing ATMWOB, and we are now ready to get this film made. 
This autumn, alongside an incredibly talented and motivated team, I'm hoping to use all the skills I've learned over the years to make a really compelling sci-fi short that focuses on the human drama above all else.
 
Meet the crew
We will be updating our crew list over the course of the campaign and look forward to introducing you to more of the talented team we have at our disposal! 
 


 

 

 

 
And once it's all done? 
Once the film is complete, we would love if you'd join us in Glasgow for a cheeky White Russian. Truly, it's our hope that you can join us on the journey of helping this film find its audience. It is our goal to get this film shown at film festivals across the globe, and we would love it if we could share that journey with you.
As a Scottish filmmaker, I'm also committed to getting Scotland showcased as an inspiring setting that transcends cultural stereotypes and tax havens for blockbusters. Great films have been made here, and with your help we can be a small part of that bigger story.
Hideous, my previous short, was named by Indie Shorts Mag as ""One Of The Best Scottish Thrillers Out There"". My hope is that A Trillion Miles West Of Bradford will have a similar impact for the Scottish LGBTQ sci-fi genre.

<h3><u>About <i>Georgia Peach</i></u></h3>
<p>Georgia Peach follows the interactions between Georgia, a young, inexperienced nurse, and John, her disabled, misogynistic patient. John, a veteran, grew old in systems dominated by traditional thoughts of what a ""man"" should be, gets his kicks out of preying on Georgia. However, his routine harassment is upended when, to his surprise, Georgia pushes back, leading the two down a dark, difficult road that forces Georgia to ask herself what makes a life worth saving.<br/><br/>Georgia Peach is a story about the disguises we don every day to mask aspects of ourselves we’re afraid of admitting to the world, but more specifically, what happens we take off these masks and what we look like when we’re stripped bare.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With your donation, you will be funding a film that’s ready and willing to examine the uglier truths and unspoken thoughts we all have. This is a film void of blame, a movie that emphasizes the incredible power of empathy and understanding. This film aims to capture everything we’ve all been feeling recently, the isolation, apathy and disconnect, and use it as a way to emphasize connection and unity in our everyday lives.<br/><br/>With your donation, you'll be an active contributor to not only the careers of experienced, headstrong artists, but that of the local Chicago independent film scene, which has been going through many trials and tribulations as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Now more than ever, as colleges and studios have distanced themselves from independent film, artists are being forced to rely not only on each other, but their greater communities at large.</p>

Obsessed with the difficulties we face everyday, Jonah doesn't like to make movies that allow people to escape reality, but rather, stories that give us better insight on how difficult our everyday lives really are. He believes that storytellers have a responsibility to tell redemptive stories that encourage us to be better, both to ourselves and to each other. Scripts and short films he's made have gone on to win awards in competition across the nation -- a testament to his work ethic and dedication to the craft of filmmaking.</p> <p>Previous work: <a href=""https://jocuto.myportfolio.com/work"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://jocuto.myportfolio.com/work</a></p>

Gerrit has an incredible amount of experience under his belt in the world of cinematography having shot movies both on film and digitally.<br/><br/><strong>Graysen Conklin - Production Designer</strong></p>
<p>Graysen Conklin is a production designer hailing from Louisiana. She was attracted to Georgia Peach by how easily she could personally relate to it’s characters. With a wealth of experience under her belt on both student and professional sets, she hopes to bring a personal touch to John's house, while highlighting the effect Georgia has on it.</p>

As one of the most experienced producers studying at Columbia, Kiki brings a sharp eye and a production-orientated mindset to Georgia Peach, helping us find the best way to get this story told.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Jordan Guerette - Composer</strong></p>
<p>Jordan is a composer based in Portland, Maine. He is primarily known for his work with neoclassical group Forêt Endormie and black metal group Falls of Rauros. He was attracted to work on Georgia Peach because it presented the opportunity to musically examine the themes of isolation and the loneliness epidemic through these characters, who feel like people we've all met before.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Visual Style</h3> <p>While the film is grounded in reality, it’s important to us that this film carries with it hints of something more. As our characters come face to face with secrets they’ve buried for years of their lives, we feel that opening up our film to a more expressionistic, transcendent space is the best way to communicate their journey. The way this film looks will toe this line as we begin to see the spiritual emerge from these grounded moments.</p> <p>To reflect the incredible complexity of the story at hand and the layered, nuanced nature of our characters, camera work will be utilized in a precise manner to allow our audience to understand the fundamental differences in Georgia’s and John’s view of a shared situation. Taking inspiration from films such as FIRST REFORMED, A GHOST STORY and FACES, we aim to shoot these scenes with both a critical eye and an empathetic heart.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Last but not least… COVID</h3> <p>Of course, we have to acknowledge the elephant in the room -- COVID. It’s our priority to run a safe set that minimizes close-contact between cast and crew, while of course keeping production as efficient as possible. We plan to allocate 1/3rd of our total budget to COVID/safety precautions in order to meet this goal.<br/> </p>
<p>We will require masks on set, implement social-distancing measures between cast and crew, and place mandate testing in the days approaching, during and after production in coordination with SAG-AFTRA guidelines.</p>

As one of the most experienced producers studying at Columbia, Kiki brings a sharp eye and a production-orientated mindset to Georgia Peach, helping us find the best way to get this story told.
 
Jordan Guerette - Composer
Jordan is a composer based in Portland, Maine. He is primarily known for his work with neoclassical group Forêt Endormie and black metal group Falls of Rauros. He was attracted to work on Georgia Peach because it presented the opportunity to musically examine the themes of isolation and the loneliness epidemic through these characters, who feel like people we've all met before.
 
Visual Style While the film is grounded in reality, it’s important to us that this film carries with it hints of something more. As our characters come face to face with secrets they’ve buried for years of their lives, we feel that opening up our film to a more expressionistic, transcendent space is the best way to communicate their journey. The way this film looks will toe this line as we begin to see the spiritual emerge from these grounded moments. To reflect the incredible complexity of the story at hand and the layered, nuanced nature of our characters, camera work will be utilized in a precise manner to allow our audience to understand the fundamental differences in Georgia’s and John’s view of a shared situation. Taking inspiration from films such as FIRST REFORMED, A GHOST STORY and FACES, we aim to shoot these scenes with both a critical eye and an empathetic heart.
 
Last but not least… COVID Of course, we have to acknowledge the elephant in the room -- COVID. It’s our priority to run a safe set that minimizes close-contact between cast and crew, while of course keeping production as efficient as possible. We plan to allocate 1/3rd of our total budget to COVID/safety precautions in order to meet this goal. 
We will require masks on set, implement social-distancing measures between cast and crew, and place mandate testing in the days approaching, during and after production in coordination with SAG-AFTRA guidelines.

<p>My name is Bryan Ferriter. I was born and raised in Montana. It was in the lush, beautiful landscape of my backyard in Helena, where my imagination was enriched, that I began to write and play out stories as a child.</p>
<p><i style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Hamlet</i><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">, the timeless tale, first spoke to me when I was a child, and when I began to explore acting officially as a 19-year-old college student at Carroll College, I remember blowing off the dust of a battered script I found at the library. I opened the play, and immediately stumbled on to the famous “Get thee to a nunnery” scene. Instantly compelled, I wanted to know and learn everything I could about this tragic prince exploring his own morality and his quest for vengeance.</span></p>
<p>Through many trials and tribulations, including the loss of my own father at the age of 20, I brought the full play to the stage. With the professors placing so much faith in me, allowing a 22-year-old college student to take on the monolithic role, I was absorbed and became connected on such a deep and profound level that forever changed my life.</p>
<p>For many months, I received letters from people expressing how moved they were by our production. I knew then that I was doing work outside myself, and through acting and filmmaking was the way I could render my service to the world. From this foundation, I founded my film company, Interwoven Studios.</p>
<div><p>The goal of Interwoven Studios is to bring stories to life that reach out, speak to, and move a wide array of audiences. Our hope is that after viewing this latest film, as well as those before, audiences can walk away with new ideas and perspectives.</p></div>

The story is about homegrown moonshine and we intend to make this film the same way - on our own. We will utilize family-owned property and locations with a cast and crew made up primarily of friends and family.

People have an innate need to see themselves reflected in stories. We need to see characters who share our flaws, who harbour our innermost desires, and grapple with our most intense struggles. These stories help us realise we are not alone. They help people grow and heal. They give people hope. </p><p> </p><p>We come from a small rural town on the border of Pennsylvania. Growing up we saw many characters around us. There were people who were often good and often bad, and in many ways flawed. As we got older we rarely saw these characters given a chance at redemption on screen.</p><p> </p><p>We want to change that. Moonwater is a story of a rural man coming to terms with his flaws. The main character is grappling with his past and his future. He is a small town man that doesn’t want to lose his heritage in the new world, but feels he must come to terms with his future. It’s a story we think has gone untold for a long time, but resonates on a deep and universal level.</p><p> </p><p>Moreso, Moonwater focuses on a particular part of American culture that is fading - Moonshine. We believe this is a unique part of American heritage. It is a tradition that was formed in the early twentieth century during Prohibition. It is a tradition that has largely been passed down between family members, and like many things, is at risk of being forgotten in a modern world. </p><p> </p><p>Movies are important to people. They can give us a way to start to understand ourselves and the world around us. That’s the movie we want to make. A movie that helps people, that shows us something about ourselves that maybe we never realized, and that maybe helps us grow as people. We hope you want to help us.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1626409729/u8iv7ht2g8bjfw6yc3an.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3> </h3><h3> </h3><h3>Why We Need You</h3><p>This movie is about moonshine.

When he finds his late father’s long-abandoned moonshine still he sets out to revive it for one final batch, reconnecting with his brother and his father’s legacy in the process. Indiegogo to get us over the humpAs a team we already have raised $25,000 for ""Moonwater."" We need your help to raise the last $5,000 to get this movie made. Any contribution large or small will help make the movie that much better.The ShortMOONWATER, the short film, had its world premiere at the Indie Shorts Awards Cannes 2021. Moonwater will continue its festival run this year at Beverly Hills Film Festival, Lift- Off Film Showcase, Tonkawa Film Festival (where it won Best Short Drama) and more.  The Feature Film “Moonwater is a stirring and intimate portrait of a man who carries on his father’s legacy in the only way that’s been passed down to him. Small moments of humanity shine throughout. Peter is a heartbreaking but compelling character who, despite his flaws, has tiny intricacies that make him endearing to the audience “  - Slamdance Screenplay CompetitionMOONWATER, The feature film will expand on the short film it is based on. The film follows Peter and Thomas as they rebuild their father’s old moonshine still together, and in the process they rebuild their fractured relationship. Why Is This Unique?This will be a truly grassroots film, from concept to creation. The story is about homegrown moonshine and we intend to make this film the same way - on our own. We will utilize family-owned property and locations with a cast and crew made up primarily of friends and family. However, we intend to elevate this grassroots endeavor with ambitious filmmaking centered around a powerful and well-crafted story by award winning filmmakers.  Why do we want to make this film?We believe this movie is important. People have an innate need to see themselves reflected in stories. We need to see characters who share our flaws, who harbour our innermost desires, and grapple with our most intense struggles. These stories help us realise we are not alone. They help people grow and heal. They give people hope.  We come from a small rural town on the border of Pennsylvania. Growing up we saw many characters around us. There were people who were often good and often bad, and in many ways flawed. As we got older we rarely saw these characters given a chance at redemption on screen. We want to change that. Moonwater is a story of a rural man coming to terms with his flaws. The main character is grappling with his past and his future. He is a small town man that doesn’t want to lose his heritage in the new world, but feels he must come to terms with his future. It’s a story we think has gone untold for a long time, but resonates on a deep and universal level. Moreso, Moonwater focuses on a particular part of American culture that is fading - Moonshine. We believe this is a unique part of American heritage. It is a tradition that was formed in the early twentieth century during Prohibition. It is a tradition that has largely been passed down between family members, and like many things, is at risk of being forgotten in a modern world.  Movies are important to people. They can give us a way to start to understand ourselves and the world around us. That’s the movie we want to make. A movie that helps people, that shows us something about ourselves that maybe we never realized, and that maybe helps us grow as people. We hope you want to help us.   Why We Need YouThis movie is about moonshine. We need to raise funds to make this movie the same way the moonshine it centers on is made: on our own. The only way we can make this movie truthful is if we do it independently, without the interference of an institution. This is the true meaning of grassroots. Made the old school way, with heart and passion.   How You Can HelpThis is where you come in! Here's a look at where your contribution will go. Everybody involved is passionate about the project and willing to help make this film happen on an indie budget.$5,000 will us to pay our cast and crew at a time when creatives are really struggling.Funds will go towards:Cast and CrewProduction Design CostumesLocations (Small House, Front Porch, Hardware Store, Liquor Store, Hunting Shop)Camera and Sound EquipmentInsuranceHousingFoodPost production (editing and sound design)Festival fees If you are unable to help by backing the project, perhaps you may be able to help us with any of the above. If so, please get in touch with Tyler or Mark! Risks and challengesThere are many unknown factors in making an independent film. However, we have already made the short film as a proof of concept for what we are capable of with half the resources we will have for the feature film. This film means everything to us and we will do everything in our power to make it the best film it can be. Don’t Think We Can Pull It Off?We already have! We’re essentially making the feature the same way we made the short, with the addition of a few more teammates.  Other Ways You Can HelpWe understand that the last year has been incredibly challenging and not everyone has the financial resources to help out. If you cannot contribute financially, there are still ways you can help!  Perhaps you can help with donating locations, equipment or food.Or perhaps you can share this page with anyone who may be interested in supporting this project and follow and share our official instagram @moonwater_film\ Who We AreWriter/Director: William Tyler WisemanTyler grew up in Tioga, New York.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>** New Stretch Goal £15 000**</strong></h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We made our goal in 14 days! Thank you so much to all of our backers. We are still raising funds! Every pound over the goal will go towards paying our cast and crew and producing a film of the best quality. Please continue to spread the word and contribute if you can. </p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Across the UK today, 6.5 million people are carers, supporting a loved one who is older, disabled or seriously ill. Many don’t know how or where to get help. It can be frightening and lonely. Then you add a worldwide pandemic and care home crisis into the mix and the pressures and difficulties are tenfold.</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The Carer is a story that centres around loneliness, guilt and sacrifice that aims to give a raw insight into a daughter’s mental and physical breakdown under the demands of full-time care giving at a time when so many are struggling. We explore the complexities of being the ‘carer’ and the cared for and how those roles can alternate depending on perspective and situation.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Thank you so much for supporting the arts during this time and helping raise awareness to our cause. By supporting our project, you will be helping a group of female filmmakers progress to the next stage in their careers and create even more important and relevant content.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1612701462/irnl9hhbtyc1ufmwebwa.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;margin-left:40px;"">The Story</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">With moments of dark comedy and heart-breaking sadness, The Carer meets LISA, a woman in her forties who has never truly left home, at the tipping point of her crippling inability to establish necessary boundaries in her life. Lisa is stuck in an endless routine of cleaning and caring for her sick mother MARY but today is tougher than most.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Georgia started writing The Carer, as a consequence of her own personal circumstances. As her own parents aged and some of her closest friends started to have to look after their parents, something was taken for granted and readily assumed; those who gave up full-time jobs, reorganised their lives, and even moved countries, were overwhelmingly female. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Caring can be extremely rewarding and life enhancing. Knowing you are helping someone you deeply love and making them feel a little safer and less alone, is priceless. However, there is a cost and carers do need to be equally provided for. Being a sole carer, can be lonely and taxing. If you are a single person, or have a limited support system yourself, without a solid network around you, it can be an isolating and testing experience. Caring can go on for years, and who wants to listen to the daily updates of a story which can be monotonous and upsetting. Which led to the initial theme, of who actually cares for the carer? </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The pandemic has brought on many challenges, but nobody can deny that care homes have undergone tremendous difficulties and there is a fundamental crisis in regard to looking after the ageing population. Speaking to an elderly relative, at the start of lockdown, she protested that she would lock herself in, and have to be crow barred out, rather than go into a care home. She adamantly stated that “nobody was coming in”. When Georgia’s own father ended up in hospital during May 2020, and with her own mother being extremely critically vulnerable and shielding, Georgia became her full-time protector.  She witnessed first-hand the distress and terror, Covid 19 ushered in, on top of already pre-existing anxieties.</p>

We made our goal in 14 days! Thank you so much to all of our backers. We are still raising funds! Every pound over the goal will go towards paying our cast and crew and producing a film of the best quality. Please continue to spread the word and contribute if you can. 
 
Across the UK today, 6.5 million people are carers, supporting a loved one who is older, disabled or seriously ill. Many don’t know how or where to get help. It can be frightening and lonely. Then you add a worldwide pandemic and care home crisis into the mix and the pressures and difficulties are tenfold.
The Carer is a story that centres around loneliness, guilt and sacrifice that aims to give a raw insight into a daughter’s mental and physical breakdown under the demands of full-time care giving at a time when so many are struggling. We explore the complexities of being the ‘carer’ and the cared for and how those roles can alternate depending on perspective and situation.
Thank you so much for supporting the arts during this time and helping raise awareness to our cause. By supporting our project, you will be helping a group of female filmmakers progress to the next stage in their careers and create even more important and relevant content.

The Story
With moments of dark comedy and heart-breaking sadness, The Carer meets LISA, a woman in her forties who has never truly left home, at the tipping point of her crippling inability to establish necessary boundaries in her life. Lisa is stuck in an endless routine of cleaning and caring for her sick mother MARY but today is tougher than most.
Georgia started writing The Carer, as a consequence of her own personal circumstances. As her own parents aged and some of her closest friends started to have to look after their parents, something was taken for granted and readily assumed; those who gave up full-time jobs, reorganised their lives, and even moved countries, were overwhelmingly female. 
Caring can be extremely rewarding and life enhancing. Knowing you are helping someone you deeply love and making them feel a little safer and less alone, is priceless. However, there is a cost and carers do need to be equally provided for. Being a sole carer, can be lonely and taxing. If you are a single person, or have a limited support system yourself, without a solid network around you, it can be an isolating and testing experience. Caring can go on for years, and who wants to listen to the daily updates of a story which can be monotonous and upsetting. Which led to the initial theme, of who actually cares for the carer? 
The pandemic has brought on many challenges, but nobody can deny that care homes have undergone tremendous difficulties and there is a fundamental crisis in regard to looking after the ageing population. Speaking to an elderly relative, at the start of lockdown, she protested that she would lock herself in, and have to be crow barred out, rather than go into a care home. She adamantly stated that “nobody was coming in”. When Georgia’s own father ended up in hospital during May 2020, and with her own mother being extremely critically vulnerable and shielding, Georgia became her full-time protector.  She witnessed first-hand the distress and terror, Covid 19 ushered in, on top of already pre-existing anxieties.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>What We Need (&amp; What You Get!)</u></h2>
<p>We are looking to raise funds to cover the cost of post-production of Flesh &amp; Oil. </p>

<p>Now that shooting is done and we have all the footage needed there are still several stages the piece must go through in order to be the best it can be. To do so it will need to be edited, an original soundtrack will need to be commissioned and added, as well as certain visual and sound effects of which can become quite costly, The money raised will be going towards covering the costs of designers and visual effects artists that will work incredibly hard to make sure everything looks and sounds the best it can so that audiences are able to immerse themselves in this amazing new world the filmmakers have conceived.</p>

Dystopia is a brand new time travel
TV show in the vein of Looper ? 12 Monkeys? The terminator films - all great
time travel adventures about avoiding a future fate that we need to avoid at
all costs.




As our mood reel above demonstrates we're about to embark on creating a post apocalyptic future landscape for a brand new TV show. 

SYNOPSIS

The future is a bleak place. Mankind is dying. The planet is now a war torn place, because of a worldwide fertility epidemic meaning that no one is able to have children. It’s because of a microchip identity system that was introduced into the population in 2019. An unexpected side effect of the chip in the human body was the loss of fertility in both men and women.  Riots and religious hysteria meant Marshall Law was implemented in 2023 and for the last 20 years that’s how the world has existed and tried to come to terms with their new situation. Every school has closed – as the world no has no children, the last of that generation are getting older.


Two scientists trying to discover teleportation, accidently stumble on time travel and work out that they can make a one way trip to 2017 to save humanity from the BIOCORP people that introduce the chip ID syetem and ultimately seal the fate of all mankind.
But all is not as easy as it seems. The Scientists who travel back in time must have the bodies in a state of cryo stasis in the future  - any harm coming to them in 2047 will effect them in 2017. 


The show is set both in the future and in the past. We traverse the two worlds with their unfolding narratives, equally effecting each other building to a surprising season finale.
CAST

 We've assembled a fantastic prospective cast for the TV show, drawing on plenty of action and sci fi favourites . All the right ingredients for a hit TV show.

WHAT WILL THE SHOW LOOK LIKE? THE WRITER
 Our show will look amazing thanks to the good people at Light Works - who have agreed to provide the VFX for our time travel show.

As you can see the guys know their sci fi stuff! And whilst we don't have spaceships in our story, we do have a time travel element and need to create a whole post apocalyptic landscape for our characters. The type of nightmare future that we're trying to create comes from these visual illustrations:

<p><i><strong>UNCOMMON APPLICATION</strong></i> is a short film inspired by Ris Igrec and Stella Wunder's experiences with applying to college during the peak of the 2019 college admissions bribery scandal.    </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616104753/vtjkbdr4ixdlz29ogynt.jpg"" src=""""/>  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Stella (left) and Ris (right), 2019</i>   </p>
<p>It follows Jacqueline ""Jack"" Stewart, a high school senior facing constant pressure from her parents to go to a prestigious college. Following a stinging rejection from her first choice, she begins to realize that she may not be cut out to meet her parents' expectations. However, she is determined not to be a disappointment and begins to pursue some... <strong><i>unconventional</i> methods to the college admissions process</strong>. She wants to prove that she can do it, that she is good enough, smart enough, strong enough. But the consequences of her lies inevitably catch up to her. Was all of it worth it? Will she make her own path in life? Can she ever be happy? </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">YOUR IMPACT</h3>
<p>Making a movie is expensive! Your donations will go towards renting equipment, costumes, set dressing, transportation/lodging on set, location rentals, COVID safety equipment, festival fees, and supporting our cast and crew in their incredibly hard work. We are endlessly grateful for any amount of support given to us, whether it's $1 or $100. By donating to our project, <strong>you are helping to support young artists in a time where art is suffering and enabling a community of talented people to make something beautiful.</strong> We want this film to be a career launching pad for every person on board, and with a high quality film, our chances of success only increase. If you choose to donate a set amount, we have many tiers available for you to receive perks. In the event that we exceed our goal, or our stretch goal, the money will be put back into supporting our cast and crew for their hard work over these many months, as well as expanding our opportunities to apply for more festivals.</p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">THE TEAM</h3>
<p>We are a collection of driven artists who are all banding together on this project to create a beautiful piece of art that tells a relatable, funny, and interesting story that is so familiar to so many people today.  Our crew is expansive and dedicated and we want to recognize each and every person's efforts in making a film that every person can be proud of. The arts need help right now as well as dedication and innovation, which is exactly what we intend to bring to the table. </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</h3>
<p>There are obvious challenges to making an independent film, even more so with a pandemic going on. Through our school, our entire crew anticipates to be vaccinated by the time of shooting. However, COVID still poses a risk. In the event that the coronavirus halts our production, we will push back filming to a time when everybody is safe and healthy. Our contingency dates for filming would take place in late August. Regardless of the hurdles we may face, we can guarantee that should we reach our goal, you will see our film become a reality. </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">I CAN'T DONATE. HOW CAN I HELP?</h3>
<p>There are so many ways to support young creatives if you can’t support the project monetarily. We have many social medias which you can check out and share amongst your friends and family. <strong>Facebook (and other social media in general) shares do wonders for Indiegogo exposure, so even just a quick share will help get our campaign on more people’s radars. </strong></p>

Stella (left) and Ris (right), 2019   
It follows Jacqueline ""Jack"" Stewart, a high school senior facing constant pressure from her parents to go to a prestigious college. Following a stinging rejection from her first choice, she begins to realize that she may not be cut out to meet her parents' expectations. However, she is determined not to be a disappointment and begins to pursue some... unconventional methods to the college admissions process. She wants to prove that she can do it, that she is good enough, smart enough, strong enough. But the consequences of her lies inevitably catch up to her. Was all of it worth it? Will she make her own path in life? Can she ever be happy? 

YOUR IMPACT
Making a movie is expensive! Your donations will go towards renting equipment, costumes, set dressing, transportation/lodging on set, location rentals, COVID safety equipment, festival fees, and supporting our cast and crew in their incredibly hard work. We are endlessly grateful for any amount of support given to us, whether it's $1 or $100. By donating to our project, you are helping to support young artists in a time where art is suffering and enabling a community of talented people to make something beautiful. We want this film to be a career launching pad for every person on board, and with a high quality film, our chances of success only increase. If you choose to donate a set amount, we have many tiers available for you to receive perks. In the event that we exceed our goal, or our stretch goal, the money will be put back into supporting our cast and crew for their hard work over these many months, as well as expanding our opportunities to apply for more festivals.

THE TEAM
We are a collection of driven artists who are all banding together on this project to create a beautiful piece of art that tells a relatable, funny, and interesting story that is so familiar to so many people today.  Our crew is expansive and dedicated and we want to recognize each and every person's efforts in making a film that every person can be proud of. The arts need help right now as well as dedication and innovation, which is exactly what we intend to bring to the table. 
Meet the crew!

RISKS & CHALLENGES
There are obvious challenges to making an independent film, even more so with a pandemic going on. Through our school, our entire crew anticipates to be vaccinated by the time of shooting. However, COVID still poses a risk. In the event that the coronavirus halts our production, we will push back filming to a time when everybody is safe and healthy. Our contingency dates for filming would take place in late August. Regardless of the hurdles we may face, we can guarantee that should we reach our goal, you will see our film become a reality. 

I CAN'T DONATE. HOW CAN I HELP?
There are so many ways to support young creatives if you can’t support the project monetarily. We have many social medias which you can check out and share amongst your friends and family. Facebook (and other social media in general) shares do wonders for Indiegogo exposure, so even just a quick share will help get our campaign on more people’s radars.

<h3>My Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>My name is Michelle Farrell and this is my first of hopefully many projects in the near future!</li>
<li>This campaign is extremely important to me because, as a fiction thriller and suspense author, I have a story to tell and what better way than adapt the story for film?</li>
<li>Contributors will assist in bringing this project to life and make it happen! My readers can see the story in their heads while they read, imagine how they will feel when they see the story with their eyes and all because of the generous help from the contributors!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Some Basic </h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Total needed is 27K</li>
<li>Let's talk perks, shall we! Some contributors will qualify to grab an on set extra role. Some contributors may qualify to hang out on set and watch the filming on a special day. All contributors will see their names written in the credits as a special THANK YOU! Do you like T-shirts? I think every human being that I know does, so if you make a small contribution, expect a T-shirt! The shirt will have the picture that is connected to this campaign.</li>
<li>If the goal is not reached (But we are going to stay positive, right!) Funds obtained will first go to the crew. Their cost is estimated to be $10,000 for 14 days of shooting. This brings me back to the ""Staying positive part"" if any over the 10k, will go towards the permits for locations and associated fees. Next will go towards the wonderful and very talented cast. The auditions were outstanding and I wish that you could see what each selected actor brought to the table! Back to the topic of funds, if not reached. Let's say we have the amount of the 19k that covers the cast and crew (including MUA and wardrobe assistant), this amount will go towards equipment rental. We have a scene that requires a lift as well as a large greenscreen backdrop to simulate a car falling into a river with someone jumping in after it. Since this is my first go-round...I can't actually involve real rivers and what-not. (One day...*crossing fingers*), so I have to fake it and make it look good!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>This project is valuable because the lead character is a character that has not been featured before! She is not a superhero, she doesn't have powers, she is like you and me. She has a 9 to 5, loves hanging out with her friend Denzel and hates to cook. But, yet, with Denzel by her side when her tenacity and curiosity gets a little out of hand, she is able to stand up to TWO feuding crime circles (one of them with a leader that is known as Bloody Diablo! But we are getting ahead of ourselves. Let's continue with the first film MERCIFUL SHOCK)</li>
<li>Because this is my first ever film, I don't have a track record per say, however, my story has an awesome one. I am the author of the series as I have mentioned and I am proud to say that each book of the series topped the top 50 (book 3 topped the top 5) in sells with a minimum holding titles of 1 month. The series does even better in audiobook sales! So people really like the story and that makes me proud and more determined to make this dream come true!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges :(</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>I have some challenges ahead. It is a given for someone in my position. I am completely known as an unknown. I am just a 40 something woman that lives in Kentucky that writes books. That's it. </li>
<li>Before I wrote book 1 Melody Green: Merciful Shock, I was told that I was wasting my time and I couldn't do it. Then after book 2 Melody Green: Narcissistic Trance was released, it was said again that book 1 was a fluke, book 2 was going to fail. I proved them wrong. Now that we are talking feature film, those same voice are starting to whisper and finger wag again. ""You can't make a movie!"" ""Who do you think you are?"" Well, I am ready to prove them wrong yet again. So if you have ever been an underdog, you know what I am going through. If you are determined to show your children that you can do whatever your dreams desire with sweat and tears, you understand me fully.</li>
<li>My plan to overcome the obstacle of being an ""Unknown"" into a ""Oh, yeah! I've heard of her!"" is to earn the trust, respect and showcase my talent to all that like thriller/suspense movies. I can get there by getting my film out in front of people.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know that some people  can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help. So I have this to say:</p>
<ul>
<li>Even if you can not contribute financially, you can still help me. Rest assured, if you help me get buzz out to as many people humanly possible, I will be ever so grateful! I mean, full blown ugly cry face grateful!</li>
<li>Use those Indiegogo share tools!</li>
</ul>
</div><p>Thank you so much for listening and reading my words. I am so ready to get to work and I thank each and every one of you so much in advance.</p><p> </p><p>Michelle D Farrell</p><p> </p></div>","My Summary

<p>This September I will be bringing this project back to Syracuse to shoot the FULL LENGTH feature to show the world what HALLOWEEN and CREEPING DEATH is all about!

<p>HORROR is HOTTER now more than ever and Halloween as a holiday is finally becoming more popular than Christmas. While there are many amazing Christmas movies, Halloween films are scarce and very few capture the look and feel of what this holiday is truly about.</p>

<p>Every winter hundreds of new Christmas movies are released yet Halloween still hasn't seen its fair share. We know this film has the potential to be considered a Halloween holiday classic that will be revisited and discovered by new audiences for generations long after its initial release.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge we will face is time. No matter how prepared we are, filmmaking takes time. It takes time to set up the location, light the scene, rehearse the actors and to actually film it so we get the best performance. We have a little extra challenge involved in this film because of all LARGE LOCATIONS and intense KILL scenes this film requires. Actors will need to wear prosthetics to make these gags look as realistic as possible which can take multiple hours to apply and our production crew will need more time to setup the shots due to the SCOPE this film entails.</p>
<p>With my experience working on major movie and television sets I am more than equipped and connected with the most talented cast and crew to execute my vision. I know these challenges are not easy, however, with the right preparation, planning and your support, we can definitely hurdle any obstacles. AND WE WILL!</p>

HORROR is HOTTER now more than ever and Halloween as a holiday is finally becoming more popular than Christmas. While there are many amazing Christmas movies, Halloween films are scarce and very few capture the look and feel of what this holiday is truly about.

Every winter hundreds of new Christmas movies are released yet Halloween still hasn't seen its fair share. We know this film has the potential to be considered a Halloween holiday classic that will be revisited and discovered by new audiences for generations long after its initial release.


The biggest challenge we will face is time. No matter how prepared we are, filmmaking takes time. It takes time to set up the location, light the scene, rehearse the actors and to actually film it so we get the best performance. We have a little extra challenge involved in this film because of all LARGE LOCATIONS and intense KILL scenes this film requires. Actors will need to wear prosthetics to make these gags look as realistic as possible which can take multiple hours to apply and our production crew will need more time to setup the shots due to the SCOPE this film entails.
With my experience working on major movie and television sets I am more than equipped and connected with the most talented cast and crew to execute my vision. I know these challenges are not easy, however, with the right preparation, planning and your support, we can definitely hurdle any obstacles. AND WE WILL!


We know that not everyone who reads this will be able to contribute financially. Whether you can or not, please do the campaign a giant favor and share this page with as many people as you can. In particular, share it with people you believe would love to see this movie come to life.
Share it with your nerdy horror friends, your goofy uncles, cool aunts and share it with the person you wanna have a movie night with! The more eyes on this campaign, the more money we can raise, and therefore, the better our movie will be! 
Everyone involved would love to see this thing go viral and make horror history, and we want you with us!
If you have any questions please reach out and we will absolutely answer everything we can! 
Looking forward to bringing this to a SILVER SCREAM near you very soon!",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>The Project</h2>
<p>Lost and alone, a young woman battles a downward spiral of existential depression and anxiety when she fails to reforge her connection with the divine love and light that she once knew.</p>

<p>A Renaissance woman at heart, <a href=""https://mirandayung.wixsite.com/portfolio/bio"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Miranda Yung</a> is not only a filmmaker, but an artist of many talents, including drawing, acting, and writing. She has won numerous awards for short films as a director and actor, and recognition for her screenplays. Miranda has culminated her filmmaking practice and portfolio by pursuing a Master of Fine Arts in Film and Media Production at Emerson College, taking special interest in narrative fiction writing, music video production and motion graphics. Her career also continues to grow through her professional work as Associate Creative Producer and Lead Editor at Emerson Productions.</p>
<p><strong>Director's Statement:</strong></p>
<p>""Hide and Seek is so much more than a visual album about ""having the blues"". It is a deeply personal, abstract telling of my own journey through the trenches of poor mental health toward the epiphany that even when I am most lost and in the dark, I am still precious and loved by the light.</p>
<p>I believe that as human beings we view human suffering as such a tragedy and injustice because our purpose is not to suffer or to hate, but rather to love and to be loved. Our place is not within the darkness, but within the light. I believe that we are born with an innate connection to this light, but as our innocence wanes and we are forced to age and confront an increasingly flawed and dark world, we can lose sight of its majesty and become disconnected from it. This experience of existential loss - as well as the spectrum of emotional reactions that flow from it - is the true heart of Hide and Seek.</p>
<p>My ultimate goal in sharing this story, particularly after such a dark and tragic past year, is that anyone who feels lost or has lost track of the light may see a piece of themselves in this film and realize that even though their journey may seem hopeless and exhausting, the light is always there, and our connection to it can never be broken. We are all, always, precious and worthy of love in this light. And even though it may often seem like it's hiding...it is always seeking us, just as we are seeking it.""</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.amandanicolereyesfilm.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Amanda Reyes</a> is a Tejana filmmaker from Texas whose work centers around incarceration, national identity, women’s and LGBTQA+ rights. Her short narrative films have screened on the international film festival circuit including Manchester, Oxford and Liverpool film festivals. Amanda has been featured in Remezcla Magazine, NoFilmSchool.com, NY Worth Magazine and The New York Times for the work she’s done while attending Feirstein Graduate School of Cinema where she graduated with a Masters of Fine Arts degree in directing narrative cinema. Amanda has acted in the title role of Marisol which is now streamable on Amazon Prime and her most recent directing work includes Chicas Fritas, a queer, coming of age, short film set in Queens and a series of shorts about Pandemic Life, titled This will Last and PANDEMONIUM, both streamable on her <a href=""https://www.amandanicolereyesfilm.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a> and instagram.</p>
<p>""When I first read the script to Hide &amp; Seek, I felt a deep connection to the main character. I felt like I was rereading some of the exact thoughts that have gone through my head before while I was questioning my own value on this earth. I've been through so much in my life and have had my own share of hardships that I've overcome through resilience and grace. I believe this past year has contained many tragic events that have reminded us of the resilience of humanity. Our realities are constantly shifting and, in turn, we are constantly adapting to these changes with the new information presented to us.</p>
<p>This story explores how these changes affect our personal connections to Love. Sometimes we can feel like Love has abandoned us completely when, in reality, the internal struggle to value ourselves after we experience trauma, is what clouds our judgement of how loved we actually are. I truly feel that we're creating a powerful work that reminds us of our purpose and value on this earth, that explores the deep, complex, struggle to accept and love ourselves even during our darkest hour.""</p>

She has won numerous awards and festival recognition for her short film '<a href=""https://vimeo.com/272703329"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pageant Perfect</a>', which she is now developing the feature film for. She is also well-known for her makeup artistry in media and as a variety streamer on Twitch. Throughout the last year, she has taken her skills to creative producing films and music videos with like-minded artists while she continues to explore all aspects of the medium. To Samantha, openness and vulnerability, and community are all most important to her and drive her to create.</p>
<p>""When Miranda first asked me to produce her film, without even knowing the project, I was interested in working with her in any role. I've known Miranda for several years and her art and drive inspires me. The story hooked me in and is one that I relate to as a woman with depression and anxiety who has lost that light in life before, and likely will more times throughout my life.</p>
<p>Moreover, I am so pleased to be working with a team of all women. I know the women on this team truly resonate with this story, so this is such a strong collaboration with some of my favorite artists, filmmakers, and friends. In the end, community is what it's all about!""</p>

Whether to the literate or the illiterate or even to speakers of different languages. Her goal is to not only share and express her thoughts but also make an influence step by step. In the end, presenting ideas and telling compelling stories through artworks.</p>
<p>“Hide and Seek is a visually exciting film, sends a great message, and is run by strong women. So what’s not to like about it? As an Asian woman in film, it is important for me to work on projects that support women of color and to be able to be on a set that’s run by women. I have been working with Miranda for quite some time now and it’s always a blast to work with her. She is so kind and talented, and above all a great friend.

She hopes to make a change for women filmmakers by creating more minority-led, women-centered stories.</p>
<p>""This project is important to me because it highlights the emotional journey depression can cause. I think it's a story that can resonate with a lot of people, especially after collectively experiencing a pandemic.  It creates a space to converse and de-stigmatize our views around mental health, which is important now more than ever. I'm really excited to help bring this project to life and continue these types of conversations.""</p>
</div><div>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get!</h2>
<p>The amount raised from this campaign goes right back into the people who are making this film possible. We love the ability to make art with our fellow creatives and friends, but we also understand that each person works in the industry and deserves payment for their skills and time. If we raise above our goal, we are able to do more for our cast and crew.</p>
<p>Beyond that, we wanted to give ourselves a great goal for this campaign to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give our friends good rates! First and foremost!</li>
<li>Take care of cast and crew and keep us all cool and safe in the Texas summer heat as we film, including feeding our team daily, supplying sunscreen and water bottles, as well as helping cover costs for our team's lodging in our further-away locations!</li>
<li>Afford our incredible locations and costume design.</li>
<li>Post-production needs, most-especially an amazing score since the film is also a visual album combining narrative storytelling with dance and music. The score is a large part of the story, so it will be a big investment, in both time and money, after we film.</li>
<li>Festivals! We would love to be able to have a fun festival run with this film and share it all around and invite you all to go, too!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Perks!</h3>
<p><strong>We'd like to thank you for supporting us as indie filmmakers! Our perks include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>$5 - Coffee Credit (A credit in the film simply for buying a cup of coffee to keep us awake in our long shooting days!)</li>
<li>$10 - Downloadable Link to film upon release</li>
<li>$25 - Special Thanks Credit (You are specially credited in the film!)</li>
<li>$50 Download link to Original Score</li>
<li>$100 Digital Production Bible: concept art, script with directors notes, shot list, mood board/lookbook, storyboards</li>
<li>$150 Percentage off Miranda’s art print shop (</li>
<li>$250 Personal “Love” letter from Director + Digital Download of Poster</li>

</ul>
<p>All previous perks for your support are included in each tier!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project has been filled with an all-woman team of people from all different backgrounds that we trust and work well with. We all work in the industry, and we live to create. Art and film is our livelihood and our passion! As women, and especially BIPOC women, we all have voices that we want to lift up and collaborate with - something that often feels rare for us to be able to do in the film industry.</p>
<p>However, as young independent artists, it's difficult to pay for everything and everyone who helps create with you. As much as we enjoy making films, we also must be realistic as professionals who work in the industry and freelance. We cannot expect artists, whether they be our friends or not, to work for free. It is imperative that we support and take care of one another!</p>
<p>There are so many moving pieces when it comes to making films. Stressing over monetary needs while creating art often negatively affects the project quality as well as the creators' ability to commit their time to their passion.</p>
<p>Every filmmaker on this team has had successes in this industry...and we know that goes beyond just ourselves. We are a community!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our biggest challenges fall into the ability to pay our professional filmmaking friends and colleagues for their skills and time, as well as paying for locations both to shoot at and for lodging. Director Miranda Yung is putting in funds beyond this campaign already for the heavy production design of the film, film equipment, travel, and more.</p>
<p>We have a 6-day shoot across multiple locations, including outside in the Texas summer heat. That is also a big challenge as we must keep our team transported, lodged, hydrated, cool, fed, healthy, and happy. The funds raised here go into our ability to do just that.</p>
<p>Making films over the years, we know that taking care of each other is Number One Priority! This campaign helps us do just that with ease.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Every dollar helps us lift this project off the ground and up to the stars, so we'd love your contribution and support!</p>
<p>We hope you will all share this project around! We are SO excited to create this big art project together and hope you're excited to see it.</p>

Moreover, I am so pleased to be working with a team of all women. I know the women on this team truly resonate with this story, so this is such a strong collaboration with some of my favorite artists, filmmakers, and friends. In the end, community is what it's all about!""

Amber Yang is a multimedia artist. She studied photography and graphic design in her undergraduate career, and now Amber focuses on cinematography with graphic design on the side. She takes film photography for fun and is always working on a book design project! Amber believes that presenting images is the most direct way to make an influence or present an idea. Whether to the literate or the illiterate or even to speakers of different languages. Her goal is to not only share and express her thoughts but also make an influence step by step. In the end, presenting ideas and telling compelling stories through artworks.
“Hide and Seek is a visually exciting film, sends a great message, and is run by strong women. So what’s not to like about it? As an Asian woman in film, it is important for me to work on projects that support women of color and to be able to be on a set that’s run by women. I have been working with Miranda for quite some time now and it’s always a blast to work with her. She is so kind and talented, and above all a great friend. I am so grateful and excited to be able to be on this project!”

Cristina Gonzalez is a Mexican-American filmmaker. She was born and raised in Austin, Texas, and received her BA in Media Arts from the University of North Texas. She's very passionate about being a director as well as a production designer, this shows in much of her work, like her short film 'Suffocate', which has had success in festivals and screenings all around. She hopes to make a change for women filmmakers by creating more minority-led, women-centered stories.
""This project is important to me because it highlights the emotional journey depression can cause. I think it's a story that can resonate with a lot of people, especially after collectively experiencing a pandemic.  It creates a space to converse and de-stigmatize our views around mental health, which is important now more than ever. I'm really excited to help bring this project to life and continue these types of conversations.""

What We Need & What You Get!
The amount raised from this campaign goes right back into the people who are making this film possible. We love the ability to make art with our fellow creatives and friends, but we also understand that each person works in the industry and deserves payment for their skills and time. If we raise above our goal, we are able to do more for our cast and crew.
Beyond that, we wanted to give ourselves a great goal for this campaign to:

Give our friends good rates! First and foremost!
Take care of cast and crew and keep us all cool and safe in the Texas summer heat as we film, including feeding our team daily, supplying sunscreen and water bottles, as well as helping cover costs for our team's lodging in our further-away locations!
Afford our incredible locations and costume design.
Post-production needs, most-especially an amazing score since the film is also a visual album combining narrative storytelling with dance and music. The score is a large part of the story, so it will be a big investment, in both time and money, after we film.
Festivals! We would love to be able to have a fun festival run with this film and share it all around and invite you all to go, too!

Perks!
We'd like to thank you for supporting us as indie filmmakers! Our perks include:

$5 - Coffee Credit (A credit in the film simply for buying a cup of coffee to keep us awake in our long shooting days!)
$10 - Downloadable Link to film upon release
$25 - Special Thanks Credit (You are specially credited in the film!)
$50 Download link to Original Score
$100 Digital Production Bible: concept art, script with directors notes, shot list, mood board/lookbook, storyboards
$150 Percentage off Miranda’s art print shop (
$250 Personal “Love” letter from Director + Digital Download of Poster
$350 Sponsor Credit + Physical Poster + Script signed
$500 Impact Producer Credit + Be on set with us for a day! 
$1000 Producer Credit + Invite to Premiere Screening
$3000 Executive Producer Credit + Dinner with the Filmmakers (WOW! We are insanely grateful for this! You have taken care of our team immensely! Please eat and hang out with some of us!)

All previous perks for your support are included in each tier!

The Impact
This project has been filled with an all-woman team of people from all different backgrounds that we trust and work well with. We all work in the industry, and we live to create. Art and film is our livelihood and our passion! As women, and especially BIPOC women, we all have voices that we want to lift up and collaborate with - something that often feels rare for us to be able to do in the film industry.
However, as young independent artists, it's difficult to pay for everything and everyone who helps create with you. As much as we enjoy making films, we also must be realistic as professionals who work in the industry and freelance. We cannot expect artists, whether they be our friends or not, to work for free. It is imperative that we support and take care of one another!
There are so many moving pieces when it comes to making films. Stressing over monetary needs while creating art often negatively affects the project quality as well as the creators' ability to commit their time to their passion.
Every filmmaker on this team has had successes in this industry...and we know that goes beyond just ourselves. We are a community!

Risks & Challenges
Our biggest challenges fall into the ability to pay our professional filmmaking friends and colleagues for their skills and time, as well as paying for locations both to shoot at and for lodging. Director Miranda Yung is putting in funds beyond this campaign already for the heavy production design of the film, film equipment, travel, and more.
We have a 6-day shoot across multiple locations, including outside in the Texas summer heat. That is also a big challenge as we must keep our team transported, lodged, hydrated, cool, fed, healthy, and happy. The funds raised here go into our ability to do just that.
Making films over the years, we know that taking care of each other is Number One Priority! This campaign helps us do just that with ease.

Other Ways You Can Help
Every dollar helps us lift this project off the ground and up to the stars, so we'd love your contribution and support!
We hope you will all share this project around! We are SO excited to create this big art project together and hope you're excited to see it.
Follow the film and the rest of our team!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We're in the last days of post production on 'Embodyment', an ambitious, impactful film about three dancers in the last rehearsal for an upcoming show.  It's been an incredible labor of love for everyone involved, and now we want so much to be able to send it around to a variety of film festivals (domestic and international) over the coming year.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The catch is that every festival has a submission fee, and they certainly add up quickly!  We want to be able to give this film its best chance at discovering its audience, and we're looking at an average cost of $50 per festival.  The more we raise, the more festivals we'll be able to submit for, and the more we can promote our film in other ways.</p>
<p>A donation to this fundraiser, of any amount, will get you access to watch the film on our website after our premiere party on July 10.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In helping us cover these costs, you'll play a direct role in helping our film reach its audience, which is so important in so many ways. </p>
<p>If we submit and are selected, participating in the festivals will take our film around the world, and give it a chance to be seen by so many more people than a small production company like ours could usually expect.</p>

This will mean we can use high-level equipment such as an Arri Alexa camera and related kit, and invest more in production design to make the period era pop on screen. </p><h2>Risks and Challenges</h2><p>Any production comes with its own unique risks and challenges. Here’s what we anticipate we’ll face – and what we’re doing to mitigate risk.</p><h3>Insurance</h3><p>We're covered by the required insurances on this project to mitigate risk against accidents, unforeseen circumstances, and other potential issues.</p><h3>Crew Challenges </h3><p>Post-Covid means crew are in high demand as productions that were put on pause have now restarted all at once. </p><p>We’re planning the shoot of this short film for November 2021, allowing plenty of time to secure reliable and experienced crew.<br/><br/>Should Covid-19 still be a challenge at the time of filming, and any crew member is unable to attend at short notice due to isolation guidance, we have an extensive network of experienced crew to ensure continuity of the shoot.</p><h3>Diversity Challenges</h3><p>We recognise that the screen industries are historically limited in access to opportunities through non-traditional routes and all forms of diversity.</p><p>Those involved with the production will come from a range of backgrounds, including neurodiverse, disabled, and other under-represented minorities. This includes, where possible, opportunities for those starting out in TV and film from non-traditional routes to assist, shadow, or participate to gain experience and be a valuable part of the production. </p><h3>Kit Challenges</h3><p>Using high-quality kit is only as good as the person operating it. That’s why we’ve secured Colin Coomber, an experienced DoP with in-depth understanding of how to make the most of the kit on a limited budget. </p><h3>Covid-19 Challenges</h3><p>Production is scheduled for November 2021 in the hope that much of the current threat of Covid-19 is in the past.</p><p>In addition, cast and crew will adhere to guidelines in place at the time of filming, such as social distancing. Masks and hand sanitiser will also be available to all cast and crew throughout the production period. Where required, additional cleaning of the location will take place. Lead crew members will also have taken the “Coronavirus basic awareness in production” training provided by ScreenSkills UK.</p><h3>Budget Challenges</h3><p>We’re creating a period piece on a limited budget to avoid overspend on unnecessary production items and maximise the potential of your investment seen on the screen itself. </p><p>We’ll operate on a limited crew, and have only five cast members and one single location. This keeps the budget as small as possible whilst remaining faithful to the original story.</p><p>If possible, our location will include accommodation for some cast and crew to reduce costs. </p><h3>Project Delays and Other Challenges</h3><p>As we’ve all seen since 2020, sometimes things can go awry. We’ll ensure we’re as prepared as possible by covering the production with all required insurances to mitigate risk caused by unforeseen accidents, incidents, weather, or other difficulties.</p><h3>Sustainability and Environmental Impact</h3><p>We’re determined to ensure our production is as sustainable and environmentally-friendly as possible. This includes:</p><ul>
<li>Using a location close to the majority of cast and crew to reduce travel miles</li>
<li>Shooting at a single location with production base on-site</li>
<li>Online meetings and script readings instead of in-person</li>
<li>Using public transport and shared vehicle journeys where possible</li>
<li>Hiring materials and props where possible</li>
<li>Paper-free where possible and recycling paper materials</li>
<li>Sustainable catering including plastic-free containers where possible</li>
<li>Training with We Are Albert (funded by industry organisations) to ensure sustainability awareness during pre-production, shoot, and post-production<br/> </li>

This will mean we can use high-level equipment such as an Arri Alexa camera and related kit, and invest more in production design to make the period era pop on screen. Risks and ChallengesAny production comes with its own unique risks and challenges. Here’s what we anticipate we’ll face – and what we’re doing to mitigate risk.InsuranceWe're covered by the required insurances on this project to mitigate risk against accidents, unforeseen circumstances, and other potential issues.Crew Challenges Post-Covid means crew are in high demand as productions that were put on pause have now restarted all at once. We’re planning the shoot of this short film for November 2021, allowing plenty of time to secure reliable and experienced crew.Should Covid-19 still be a challenge at the time of filming, and any crew member is unable to attend at short notice due to isolation guidance, we have an extensive network of experienced crew to ensure continuity of the shoot.Diversity ChallengesWe recognise that the screen industries are historically limited in access to opportunities through non-traditional routes and all forms of diversity.Those involved with the production will come from a range of backgrounds, including neurodiverse, disabled, and other under-represented minorities. This includes, where possible, opportunities for those starting out in TV and film from non-traditional routes to assist, shadow, or participate to gain experience and be a valuable part of the production. Kit ChallengesUsing high-quality kit is only as good as the person operating it. That’s why we’ve secured Colin Coomber, an experienced DoP with in-depth understanding of how to make the most of the kit on a limited budget. Covid-19 ChallengesProduction is scheduled for November 2021 in the hope that much of the current threat of Covid-19 is in the past.In addition, cast and crew will adhere to guidelines in place at the time of filming, such as social distancing. Masks and hand sanitiser will also be available to all cast and crew throughout the production period. Where required, additional cleaning of the location will take place. Lead crew members will also have taken the “Coronavirus basic awareness in production” training provided by ScreenSkills UK.Budget ChallengesWe’re creating a period piece on a limited budget to avoid overspend on unnecessary production items and maximise the potential of your investment seen on the screen itself. We’ll operate on a limited crew, and have only five cast members and one single location. This keeps the budget as small as possible whilst remaining faithful to the original story.If possible, our location will include accommodation for some cast and crew to reduce costs. Project Delays and Other ChallengesAs we’ve all seen since 2020, sometimes things can go awry. We’ll ensure we’re as prepared as possible by covering the production with all required insurances to mitigate risk caused by unforeseen accidents, incidents, weather, or other difficulties.Sustainability and Environmental ImpactWe’re determined to ensure our production is as sustainable and environmentally-friendly as possible. This includes:
Using a location close to the majority of cast and crew to reduce travel miles
Shooting at a single location with production base on-site
Online meetings and script readings instead of in-person
Using public transport and shared vehicle journeys where possible
Hiring materials and props where possible
Paper-free where possible and recycling paper materials
Sustainable catering including plastic-free containers where possible
Training with We Are Albert (funded by industry organisations) to ensure sustainability awareness during pre-production, shoot, and post-production

The story is an emotionally intense hat-tip to Twilight Zone and Hitchcock; it tells the tale of a father trapped in a downward spiral of grief as he receives the same phone call every day for thirty years.. from his dead son. The help we need is easy.We would like help covering the expenses of submitting to film festivals. It's not that they are super expensive, we'd just like to submit to as many as possible. As this is our last short film, it would be exciting to try and win an award for it.

The film has a life of its own. A life that many queer people would connect with. I started writing “It’s Just Us'' at a time when my soul was recovering from a day that destroyed the lives of an entire population - the Beirut explosion on the 4th of August 2020. Beirut lives in my heart. Everything we had was taken away from us - our home, our souls, our being. The pain Beirut makes me feel is as powerful as love. Love is euphoric. Some days you feel a number of good vibrations running through your body and other days it feels too painful to carry. It’s painful when you love something that is constantly being taken away from you. Something the world doesn’t want you to have. When I first started writing the film I called it “Isn’t Love a Revolution” as a way to express what I was feeling - an abundance of emotions, from anger to fear to pain to passion to sadness to love to hope or hopelessness and to pain again. “It’s Just Us” became part of a process of growth. As I evolved, the film evolved. It has its own muse - a muse that created a love revolution in my soul. The process matters as much as the film and its afterlife. When I was writing the script, I imagined Ayla and Leila being icons of love. The icons that would inspire love, acceptance and freedom in a society that is yet to understand that love is a universal language. It’s about people falling in love with other people regardless of their gender. Love has no boundaries. Love does not comply with any religious or cultural beliefs. It is its own belief. Creating “It’s Just Us” is my way of sparking a love revolution in people’s hearts and minds. It’s my way of fighting with the queer community. I want this film to express itself loudly and allow me to create a safe space for every Ayla and Leila and make sure they know that this love is valid and real and that they are seen. It is a piece of art but also a piece that screams for itself, is emotionally charged and comes from an intimate and sensitive place.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1625495054/phssc2nycygdtjnutxmi.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>Socials:</strong></p><p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/itsjustusshortfilm/?hl=en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.instagram.com/itsjustusshortfilm/?h...</a></p><p><a href=""https://twitter.com/itsjustusshort1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://twitter.com/itsjustusshort1</a></p><p><strong>Playlist:</strong></p><p><a href=""https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5OtKmjmGY6wEuZnXoiGScU?si=LfDd240wS1uibTO27eEo0Q&amp;dl_branch=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5OtKmjmGY6wEu...</a></p><p><strong>Sophie's LevantX Podcast:</strong></p><p>Her interview with Stephanie (Director) <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/show/7IVncRdEKFBDNonTdnPGWh?si=N4qO0bF-R76n8r-wmgq6Pw&amp;dl_branch=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://open.spotify.com/show/7IVncRdEKFBDNonTd...</a></p><p><a href=""https://open.spotify.com/show/2LxaIeKaNQ5TZ0F2Cjhfel?si=v82_Xn_HThCjelFpEyeusA&amp;dl_branch=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://open.spotify.com/show/2LxaIeKaNQ5TZ0F2C...</a></p><p><a href=""https://youtube.com/channel/UCQNa2QFrDyP9pOUI9uzRwvw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://youtube.com/channel/UCQNa2QFrDyP9pOUI9u...</a></p><p> </p><p>© Copyright LevantX .

And the perks you’ve secured with your contribution will, of course, be delivered.</p><h2>The Impact of Your Contribution</h2><p>We’ve stressed the importance of this campaign to New Mexico and New Mexicans. But this project is equally valuable if you care about independent film and quality storytelling.</p><p>Look, Disney doesn’t need to crowdfund to make another film in the Star Wars or Marvel universe. Mass-audience films such as these are great eye candy with a built-in audience, and their business model is highly successful.</p><p>Independent films are very different.

When’s the last time a film story has really made you think about some of the important decisions you’ve made? We’re not going to tell you that 2-WAY will change your life -- but it may offer you a unique vantage point for considering your own choices, and we hope it’ll provide you a story you’ll savor for some time to come.</p><h2>The Filmmakers’ Track Record</h2><p>Each of 2-WAY’s creative principals has forged a career in making media (no small thing!). When the opportunity has arisen, each filmmaker has seized the opportunity to create media that makes some small difference in the world:</p><ul>
<li>Dyanna Taylor has traveled the world lensing and directing films, documentaries, and television specials on social issues and environmental/wildlife concerns. A Buddhist, lover of animals and the natural world, Taylor also co-leads the “<a href=""https://www.vallecitos.org/retreats/523/the-wisdom-of-no-technology/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wisdom of No Technology Media Makers</a>” retreats, and just completed the 4th annual media retreat in the mountains of New Mexico.</li>
<li>Claudio Ruben has <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrUdkjT1XNs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">produced several ENDWI commercials</a> to keep the roads safe and reduce drinking and driving in New Mexico. He produced a promotional film on the value of Tibetan culture in the modern world that helped raise $1 million for the Institute of Tibetan Classics (a library of all Tibetan knowledge and culture for the world), and he co-founded and ran the Sun Valley Spiritual Film Festival from 2005-2007, a festival that presented films that explored spiritual traditions from around the world and that cherished the human spirit.</li>
<li>Aside from his work in the entertainment sphere, screenwriter/executive producer Terry Borst has scripted training videogames that <a href=""https://tborst.wordpress.com/credits/serious-games-and-simulations/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">taught firefighters to be better situational commanders, and military officers to be better leaders</a> when deployed overseas.</li>
</ul><p>Dyanna, Claudio and Terry are passionate about making 2-WAY because the big questions it asks are precisely the questions they ask about their own lives.</p><h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2><p>Any film project offers risk. There is always the possibility that the production won’t go forward, or that post-production won’t be completed. (For example, something could happen to BOTH of the executive producers; but fingers crossed, it won’t!)</p><p>However, we think this risk is minimal, and here’s why:</p><ul>
<li>Each member of the creative team is an experienced industry professional who has brought many media projects to completion.</li>
<li>The crowdfunding is one of several revenue streams we’re pursuing. We’ve already been in conversation with industry funding entities and product placement specialists. We’ve spent 18 months laying the groundwork for our film funding.</li>
<li>The budget is lean and mean, and we know how to meet deadlines and work within budget lines.</li>
<li>The state of New Mexico’s film incentives, and the cooperation of the community of Las Cruces, makes meeting our funding needs even easier.</li>
</ul><p>Our challenge is assembling the totality of our budget as quickly as possible, so we can get to production. We believe we can accomplish this before the end of 2019. Because of our collective professional experience, we know we can put together cast and crew quite rapidly -- that's actually the easy part!</p><h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2><p>We know money can be difficult to spare (but know that even a $10 contribution helps us move forward: all contributions are valuable)!</p><p>But no matter what you can or can’t contribute financially, you can also contribute in other ways:</p><p>Spread the word about 2-WAY through any social media you use, and any emails you send out to people. And feel free to mention 2-WAY when you’re conversing with people face-to-face!</p><p>Encourage your friends and family to “like” 2-WAY on social media, and view 2-WAY’s website (<a href=""https://www.2waythemovie.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2waythemovie.com</a>).

We’re going to make a terrific independent film that will also showcase southern New Mexico, Las Cruces and New Mexico State University.

He’s also managing director of Santa Fe’s Garson Studios.Lead actor Bailey Chase's screen credits include playing the beloved Deputy Sheriff Branch Connally in Longmire, Eddie in Queen of the South, Thomas Locke in 24:Legacy and dozens of other film and television roles the past two decades.Feature film drama 2-WAY is a meditation on marriage, fidelity, mortality, and second acts in American lives. The story’s in the tradition of Richard Linklater’s Before Sunrise trilogy; Blue Valentine; and Paris, Texas. This movie is aimed at an adult audience hungry for challenging and emotionally riveting content in the feature film format. (To find out much more about 2-WAY, visit us on Facebook, where we've been actively posting for more than a year.)The creative team is passionate about bringing this story to the screen -- and it’s also passionate about further developing above-the-line film/TV infrastructure in New Mexico. In the past decade, New Mexico has become a major center of production for feature films and television series -- but very few of these projects ever originate in the state. 2-WAY hopes to be part of a movement that turns that around.With the recent passage of New Mexico Senate Bill 2, there are even more reasons to develop the state’s film infrastructure outside of Albuquerque and Santa Fe. Up until now, Las Cruces has been an underutilized region, despite the city’s energy and creativity.2-WAY’s executive producers have both taught in higher education, and are also excited about involving current students and recent alums of New Mexico State University and Dona Ana Community College in all aspects of the film’s pre-production, production and post-production. From catering to publicity to on-set internships, our hope is to intersect with numerous academic programs.Success breeds success. Homegrown films produced in Las Cruces and other under-utilized regions of New Mexico will help to keep creative talent in the state, contributing back to the local economy and local educational development. Film production is an economic multiplier, as local vendors (providing everything from food to supplies to haircuts to hotel rooms) directly and indirectly profit from the presence of cast and crew.Though no one can predict the overall outreach of any one film project, we also know what happens to a region when it’s prominently featured in successful films and TV series. Films wind up marketing their shooting locations. Southern New Mexico possesses breathtaking visuals, compelling recreation activities, and entrepreneurial opportunity. As more and more film projects are undertaken in the Las Cruces, economic activity can be sure to increase (as it has in Albuquerque and Santa Fe).But in order to make this happen, 2-WAY needs your help.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>After completing my award winning short film <i>TABULA RASA (2012)</i> I had to step away from filmmaking and devote myself to a family crisis full time. During that time I kept writing and developing both features and shorts to have options at different levels to work towards when I returned to making films. During that time I planted the seeds of numerous projects. Among them, my previous short film <i>THE DISAPPEARANCE (2017)</i> (successfully backed at Kickstarter), this film <i>A QUIET THUNDER, </i>and several more. A QUIET THUNDER is a personal passion project of mine and that passion has extended to everyone who has come aboard the project since it's inception.  Each person on the production put a lot of physical, emotional, mental and financial efforts into it's creation. So, it's essential to us to raise funds to be able to finish it and put it out into the world right via festivals and streaming platforms.  Check out the film's trailer and for more insights, consider contributing to the campaign with our gratitude. The themes and ideas of this film come from personal experiences in relationships, my love for nature, it's role in symphonic desire, my respect and interest for ecology and my belief in the possiblilty of second chance. </p>

<p>I've been pledging to numerous project campaigns here at IndieGoGo and several other platforms for the better part of a decade.  And it has always brought me tremendous joy to be able to help fellow creators realize their visions. I hope and imagine I am not alone in that feeling.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1546920258/speta4gtvkdjg1wsktyd.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>You're contribution to this short film would mean us being able to finish it, by flying our actors back to location for pick-up shoots and most of all pay for film festival submission fees and give it the exposure it deserves in the festival circuit.  </p>If we succeed and give the film the exposure it deserves it could help the film reach other platforms, open doors for cast and crew and put us in the same spaces as other like minded artists or potential collaborations. <p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need at least $2,500. Where the majority of that money goes is to film festival submissions which are roughly $50 a pop (give or take) and increase in cost after each missed deadline. So, if you figure 40-50 film festivals it adds up. </p>
<p>A smaller percentage of the funds will go towards flying our actors back here, which we feel confident we can do for a reasonable cost.</p>
<p>Our backer perks range from the usual; DVD's, links, posters, screenplay, digital behind the scenes content and credits to more personal shares like a CD mix of music I listened to while writing the screenplay, a list of cast and crew filming locations and favorite hikes and even dinner at the crews favorite meet up.</p>
<p>We set our goal based on what we need to finish the film and begin the exhibition phase. If we manage to reach our goal on time we will qualify for INDEMAND funding, allowing our campaign to continue raising funds without a set deadline. This would ensure the wide net we envision for festival submissions or attention that maybe needed to technical needs. </p>
<p>If we fail to reach our goal here we will work with what we have to complete the film and begin festival submission process and then turn to another platform to finish raising funds for the exhibition phase.</p>

<p><strong><i>Lovelle Liquigan as Ku Riley and Erwin Tuazon as Lucien Landres</i></strong></p>
<p><strong>Lovelle Liquigan</strong> has been acting for 20+ years. She has worked with a variety of theatres and companies in Los Angeles and Orange County; South Coast Repertory, East West Players and Independent Shakespeare Company being among them. Directors that she has collaborated with have been Kate Whoriskey, Laurie Woolery, Tim Dang, Matthew Harrison, Melissa Chalsma, Larry Biederman, Jessica Kubzansky, Nancy Keystone, Cecilia Fannon and Erin Li. Lovelle was granted a scholarship from Primary Stages in NY, asked to audition for the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art and for the Public Theater’s Shakespeare Lab, and was contacted by the EVP of casting at NBC, Grace Wu, after her office attended a performance of, Steel Magnolias, in which Lovelle played Annelle. She is interested in and influenced by seeing women as messy, contradictory, angry, bright and complex versus the roles and characteristic often attached to them by the media and mainstream culture. The character of Ku is an off the beaten path rebel of ecology who gives herself over both professionally and personally to her love for nature. And Lovelle fleshed out both her independent and yet, captured heart with great care.</p>
<p><strong>Erwin Tuazon</strong> started acting in high school and has been involved in theatre or film since. For the  past ten years he has been a reoccurring cast member of the Independent Shakespeare Co., one of Los Angeles’ most popular theatre festivals. He was also Co-Artistic Director of the Declan Adams Theatre Company, creating modern and adapted interpretations of classic works. Other notable collaborations include working with Range View Productions and East West Players. He is a graduate of University of California, Irvine, receiving a Bachelor’s Degree in Drama and Acting. Erwin brought to the character of Lucien the nuances in his understated observations of both his professional and personal life, bringing the character to his potential surrender to the wildernesses of the heart. </p>
<p>Both these actors are huge talents in equal parts with the ferocity they can bring to the stage and the restraint and naturalism they bring to the screen. It was an honor to have them shepard the roles of Ku and Lucien.</p>

<p><strong>David Woodfin</strong> is a filmmaker and cinematographer. Alumni of California State University at Monterey Bay, he holds a Bachelor’s Degree in Cinematic Arts and Technology. Native of the Bay Area, David enjoys working on films and uniquely capturing local and foreign landscapes. He is skilled and experienced in varying formats including narrative, documentary, and experimental films. David's eye was a crucial contribution to <i><strong>A QUIET THUNDER</strong></i> because of his keen attention to the natural world - a major theme and character in the film. His honed visuals for nature and the patience that comes with photographing the unpredictible was invaluable to the production. </p>

<p><strong>Nik Oczkus</strong> has experience in many fields of filmmaking such as writing, directing, editing, sound, and now producing. In recent years Nik has been a part of many different award-winning projects  that have all strived for excellence. After graduating from San Francisco State University with a Bachelor’s Degree in Cinema, Nik had earned the opportunity to attend the 71st Cannes Film Festival to participate in the short film corner with his latest work in short narrative format, <i><strong>TO THE WRITERS</strong></i>. Since then Nik has remained dedicated to various phases of production on numerous film projects, from development, pre-production, production, post production and exhibition.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Seeing the film through will require us to have a real chance with succeeding in this campaign. We all work a lot, some with multiple jobs, have kids, I myself am losing my home of 20 years this Summer, so we're definitely up against it. But the bulk of the work is done, we have plans in place, and we need to see this post production and exhibition phase through.</p>

Short Summary
After completing my award winning short film TABULA RASA (2012) I had to step away from filmmaking and devote myself to a family crisis full time. During that time I kept writing and developing both features and shorts to have options at different levels to work towards when I returned to making films. During that time I planted the seeds of numerous projects. Among them, my previous short film THE DISAPPEARANCE (2017) (successfully backed at Kickstarter), this film A QUIET THUNDER, and several more. A QUIET THUNDER is a personal passion project of mine and that passion has extended to everyone who has come aboard the project since it's inception.  Each person on the production put a lot of physical, emotional, mental and financial efforts into it's creation. So, it's essential to us to raise funds to be able to finish it and put it out into the world right via festivals and streaming platforms.  Check out the film's trailer and for more insights, consider contributing to the campaign with our gratitude. The themes and ideas of this film come from personal experiences in relationships, my love for nature, it's role in symphonic desire, my respect and interest for ecology and my belief in the possiblilty of second chance. 
~ John David Levy

I've been pledging to numerous project campaigns here at IndieGoGo and several other platforms for the better part of a decade.  And it has always brought me tremendous joy to be able to help fellow creators realize their visions. I hope and imagine I am not alone in that feeling.

You're contribution to this short film would mean us being able to finish it, by flying our actors back to location for pick-up shoots and most of all pay for film festival submission fees and give it the exposure it deserves in the festival circuit.  If we succeed and give the film the exposure it deserves it could help the film reach other platforms, open doors for cast and crew and put us in the same spaces as other like minded artists or potential collaborations.  

What We Need & What You Get
We need at least $2,500. Where the majority of that money goes is to film festival submissions which are roughly $50 a pop (give or take) and increase in cost after each missed deadline. So, if you figure 40-50 film festivals it adds up. 
A smaller percentage of the funds will go towards flying our actors back here, which we feel confident we can do for a reasonable cost.
Our backer perks range from the usual; DVD's, links, posters, screenplay, digital behind the scenes content and credits to more personal shares like a CD mix of music I listened to while writing the screenplay, a list of cast and crew filming locations and favorite hikes and even dinner at the crews favorite meet up.
We set our goal based on what we need to finish the film and begin the exhibition phase. If we manage to reach our goal on time we will qualify for INDEMAND funding, allowing our campaign to continue raising funds without a set deadline. This would ensure the wide net we envision for festival submissions or attention that maybe needed to technical needs. 
If we fail to reach our goal here we will work with what we have to complete the film and begin festival submission process and then turn to another platform to finish raising funds for the exhibition phase.
CAST & CREW

Lovelle Liquigan as Ku Riley and Erwin Tuazon as Lucien Landres
Lovelle Liquigan has been acting for 20+ years. She has worked with a variety of theatres and companies in Los Angeles and Orange County; South Coast Repertory, East West Players and Independent Shakespeare Company being among them. Directors that she has collaborated with have been Kate Whoriskey, Laurie Woolery, Tim Dang, Matthew Harrison, Melissa Chalsma, Larry Biederman, Jessica Kubzansky, Nancy Keystone, Cecilia Fannon and Erin Li. Lovelle was granted a scholarship from Primary Stages in NY, asked to audition for the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art and for the Public Theater’s Shakespeare Lab, and was contacted by the EVP of casting at NBC, Grace Wu, after her office attended a performance of, Steel Magnolias, in which Lovelle played Annelle. She is interested in and influenced by seeing women as messy, contradictory, angry, bright and complex versus the roles and characteristic often attached to them by the media and mainstream culture. The character of Ku is an off the beaten path rebel of ecology who gives herself over both professionally and personally to her love for nature. And Lovelle fleshed out both her independent and yet, captured heart with great care.
Erwin Tuazon started acting in high school and has been involved in theatre or film since. For the  past ten years he has been a reoccurring cast member of the Independent Shakespeare Co., one of Los Angeles’ most popular theatre festivals. He was also Co-Artistic Director of the Declan Adams Theatre Company, creating modern and adapted interpretations of classic works. Other notable collaborations include working with Range View Productions and East West Players. He is a graduate of University of California, Irvine, receiving a Bachelor’s Degree in Drama and Acting. Erwin brought to the character of Lucien the nuances in his understated observations of both his professional and personal life, bringing the character to his potential surrender to the wildernesses of the heart. 
Both these actors are huge talents in equal parts with the ferocity they can bring to the stage and the restraint and naturalism they bring to the screen. It was an honor to have them shepard the roles of Ku and Lucien.

(Left) Producer Nik Oczkus, (Center) actors Lovelle Liquigan and Erwin Tuazon (Right) Cinematographer David Woodfin

David Woodfin is a filmmaker and cinematographer. Alumni of California State University at Monterey Bay, he holds a Bachelor’s Degree in Cinematic Arts and Technology. Native of the Bay Area, David enjoys working on films and uniquely capturing local and foreign landscapes. He is skilled and experienced in varying formats including narrative, documentary, and experimental films. David's eye was a crucial contribution to A QUIET THUNDER because of his keen attention to the natural world - a major theme and character in the film. His honed visuals for nature and the patience that comes with photographing the unpredictible was invaluable to the production. 

Nik Oczkus has experience in many fields of filmmaking such as writing, directing, editing, sound, and now producing. In recent years Nik has been a part of many different award-winning projects  that have all strived for excellence. After graduating from San Francisco State University with a Bachelor’s Degree in Cinema, Nik had earned the opportunity to attend the 71st Cannes Film Festival to participate in the short film corner with his latest work in short narrative format, TO THE WRITERS. Since then Nik has remained dedicated to various phases of production on numerous film projects, from development, pre-production, production, post production and exhibition.

Risks & Challenges
Seeing the film through will require us to have a real chance with succeeding in this campaign. We all work a lot, some with multiple jobs, have kids, I myself am losing my home of 20 years this Summer, so we're definitely up against it. But the bulk of the work is done, we have plans in place, and we need to see this post production and exhibition phase through.

If you are not in a position to contribute, please share this campaign with your network and/or put the campaign badge in INDIEGOGO tools on your website or social network. We deeply appreciate it! Thank you!
Much love,

Kane teaches him and their younger brother, Bailey, to love and make films, and instills in them a sense of individuality and creativity. But once Kane leaves for the military and never returns, Keller and Bailey are left to make films on their own.</p><p>Fast forward to modern-day Las Vegas, where our story follows the journeys of these two brothers and their best friend and artist, Harper. The three filmmakers enter a short film contest, sponsored by an alumnus of the same university that Harper and Keller attend, in hopes that they will win a grant to make a feature film. During the production of their short, however, Keller, Bailey, and Harper face challenges in regards to artistry and friendship, and the way they see the world will never be the same.</p><p><i>Sto</i><i>p Motion Aspect:</i> Since Keller prefers to make films through stop-motion, the story is partially told through stop-motion elements that convey how characters feel. For example, the increasing stress Keller faces is depicted as stop-motion coral growing within his throat.</p><p>Because the story is so personal to all of the students in our cast and crew, everybody is willing to volunteer their time, talents, and efforts to make this film happen. We just need help to fund the money needed to finish our film.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535091853/qsgpy5qu7e9xjsxby4fa.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>What Do We Need?</strong></p><p>UNLV Film Alumni Hunter Hopewell was awarded a grant from Johnny Brenden of Brenden Theaters, given every other year to one UNLV Film student to turn his or her script into a full-length movie.

Kane teaches him and their younger brother, Bailey, to love and make films, and instills in them a sense of individuality and creativity. But once Kane leaves for the military and never returns, Keller and Bailey are left to make films on their own.Fast forward to modern-day Las Vegas, where our story follows the journeys of these two brothers and their best friend and artist, Harper. The three filmmakers enter a short film contest, sponsored by an alumnus of the same university that Harper and Keller attend, in hopes that they will win a grant to make a feature film. During the production of their short, however, Keller, Bailey, and Harper face challenges in regards to artistry and friendship, and the way they see the world will never be the same.Stop Motion Aspect: Since Keller prefers to make films through stop-motion, the story is partially told through stop-motion elements that convey how characters feel. For example, the increasing stress Keller faces is depicted as stop-motion coral growing within his throat.Because the story is so personal to all of the students in our cast and crew, everybody is willing to volunteer their time, talents, and efforts to make this film happen. We just need help to fund the money needed to finish our film.What Do We Need?UNLV Film Alumni Hunter Hopewell was awarded a grant from Johnny Brenden of Brenden Theaters, given every other year to one UNLV Film student to turn his or her script into a full-length movie. Much of the budget was spent on equipment, licenses, permits, insurance--all the non-fun stuff you need for movies (note: equipment can be fun, depending on who you are).That leaves us needing help with things like:
Food (for cast, crew, and our many, many extras)
Transportation/Lodging
Insurance
Renting Equipment
Emergencies
Post Production
Software
Hardware/Media Storage
Locations
Film Colorist
Promotion
Film Festivals
Distribution
And finally, all the perks that we're offering our contributors

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Updates:</strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">1. <i>Due to concerns from the LGBT and feminist communities, and also because of budgetary constraints and creative reasons, I've decided to drop the LGBT and feminist elements from We Put the World to Sleep's concept. Since the three main characters in the movie embark on a mission to bring everything to an end, we would have to be extremely careful to not portray the gays and the feminists as destructive, which would paralyse the creative process and wouldn't allow us to go fully psycho and do a really dangerous movie. So the best solution is to remove the LGBT and feminist elements from the concept to not risk harming those communities, and focus on the apocalyptic goal with no restraints.</i> Adrian Țofei</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">2.<strong> You can now <a href=""https://weputtheworldtosleep.com/invest/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">invest in <i>We Put the World to Sleep</i></a>, with a contract, and receive profit from the movie’s revenues, plus associate or executive producer credits, plus join the team at all the international film festivals! Check out the investment page for more info: <a href=""https://weputtheworldtosleep.com/invest/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">weputtheworldtosleep.com/invest</a></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">3. Our Indiegogo campaign is over. Thanks a lot to all of you who supported it! We raised 1% of the movie's minimum $100,000 budget. We already have $10,000 from two investors, so we need $89,000 more to make the movie. And for that, Adrian Țofei decided to accept new investments. <strong>Let us know if you're interested in investing!</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">4. We're far from the minimum $100,000 goal, but <strong>we'll make the movie no matter what</strong>, by finding alternative ways of financing. Your contributions won't be lost! Every extra dollar matters and brings us closer to starting the production!</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">5. We'll do the movie in a way so that it cannot be used by the <strong>far-right</strong> to accuse the LGBTQ or the black community of being violent. The characters are idealistic and non-violent, their goal is positive, venturing on a metaphysical quest for ending world's pain.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">6. Adrian Țofei is determined to not portray any <strong>lesbian stereotypes</strong>. Two women fall in love the same way two men fall in love the same way a woman and a man fall in love. He's also determined to not give the characters aggressive, war-oriented attributes. On the contrary - sensitivity, affection, care, vulnerability - the things that make us all wonderful. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">7. We didn't do a <strong>pitch video</strong> because we cannot be all together in it (Erisse lives in the US, Duru &amp; Adrian live in Europe), and we do not have the time and the resources for a video that would reflect the movie's ambitions (we prefer using them for the actual film).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">8. We've recently added <strong>cheaper perks</strong> and hidden the old ones that have been claimed, that's why most of them have zero claims now. Hidden claims: 1x$500, 1x$150, 2x$75, 3x$35, 1x$15. We add the IMDb credits in one to three days from being claimed.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Aim to Achieve</h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>This movie has to shake the world. A world that is too comfortable in accepting the status-quo of discrimination, inequality, intolerance, speciesism, nationalism, pain, suffering, violence, abuse, irrational thinking, hypocrisy, corruption, greed, ignorance and so many other problems.</strong> The list never ends. And most likely it never will, since us as a species evolved via conflict/natural selection. We have it on our DNA. The capitalistic system is based on it. We cannot even enjoy a movie or a story that has no conflict. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">So we put together <strong>two women</strong> as the leads (the world loves male superiority), with <strong>different skin colors</strong> (the world loves white supremacy), <strong>different nationalities</strong> (the world loves nationalism), we make their characters <strong>lovers</strong> (the world loves heterosexuality only), we give them <strong>principles and ideals</strong> (the world loves messy thinking), and we make them <strong>save the world</strong> from its miserable existence by bringing everything to an end! (the world loves fighting for survival - the survival of the fittest and the crushing of the vulnerable)</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>We Put the World to Sleep</i> has to premiere in one of the world's <strong><a href=""https://adriantofei.com/top-100-international-film-festivals/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">top film festivals</a></strong> (Cannes, Sundance, TIFF, Venice, Berlin, Telluride, SXSW, Tribeca), secure a top distributor, travel the festival circuit and enter movie theaters around the world. That's the only way it can make a difference. But it requires a relatively big budget, and no production company would invest money and let us do this dangerous movie the way we want, the way it should be done! </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">For authenticity, <a href=""https://adriantofei.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Adrian Țofei</a> plans to do it based on <strong>controlled improvisation</strong>, just like he did his first feature, the award-winning and critically-acclaimed <a href=""https://bemycatafilmforanne.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Be My Cat: A Film for Anne</a>. Because no writer can 100% imagine how an event or discussion evolves in real life, without putting himself in that situation. And also the actors would know in advance what will happen and what they have to say, they won't discover everything during filming, limiting the naturalness. And we don't want just good acting, we want audiences to be blown away by the authenticity, to say ""wow, are you sure this is just a movie? it looks so real!"". All this makes it very hard for us to do it with a production company. They want scripts. This and the movie's dangerous anti-system concept are the main reasons why we need and ask for your support! <strong>Join us in putting the world to sleep! </strong></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Adrian Țofei was born on July 20, 1987 in Rădăuți, Romania. His mother, <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm6327621/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dorina Țofei</a>, supported him watching movies from an early age, and later, in adolescence, Adrian started spending hours each day researching film history as a hobby. He also took acting lessons, performed in high school plays and in 2007 went on to study <strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_Cojar"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ion Cojar</a>‘s acting method</strong> at Lower Danube University of Galați, then continued in 2010 with a master’s degree in acting at Spiru Haret University of Bucharest.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Erisse Peterson was born on March 7th, 1993 in Stone Mountain, Georgia, USA. She got her start in acting at an early age, after her family relocated to Los Angeles, California in 1996. As a child actor, Erisse was represented by <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1131660/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bob Feldman</a> (father of actor <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000397/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Corey Feldman</a>) and studied ballet, tap and jazz dance.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Later, Erisse Peterson attended <a href=""http://www.msabrookhaven.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mississippi School of the Arts</a>, the state’s only residential arts high school. She intensively studied theatre arts under her instructors, Dr. Robert Brooks and Tammy Stanford, and performed in numerous stage plays.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Duru Yücel Țofei was born on July 16th, 1986 in Izmir, Turkey. A very expressive child, she always had a playful existence which later proved itself when she sang in front of the whole class in primary school and staged impressions of all her teachers during secondary school. She studied theatre for a year when she was 10, which led to her playing two different characters in the play that was staged at the end of the year. From that moment on, she came to know very clearly the fact that she wanted to be an actress.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Having inherited her mother’s talent in languages, Duru also developed a similar interest and chose to study English-Turkish Interpretation and Translation in college. But her biggest passion never stopped haunting her, and following the university years, in order to have an acting training and bigger opportunities, she moved from Izmir to Istanbul and enrolled at <a href=""http://www.studiooyunculari.com/EN/Content/ABOUT-STUDIO-OYUNCULARI.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Studio Players</a>, where she received three years of <strong>acting and art education</strong> under <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0854245/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Şahika Tekand </a>and <a href=""http://esattekand.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Esat Tekand</a>. In 2014, she performed multiple times in the play named <i>Becoming A Rhinoceros 2.014</i> with The Studio Players. During 2012-2017, Duru also acted in various TV series, commercials, and a short movie which traveled to Cannes. She also likes singing, especially jazz, and has a demo she handed out just to her family and friends.

</div><div>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In case we don't reach the $300,000 goal, <strong>we'll find ways to do the movie with less money</strong>, such as changing the concept, removing expensive scenes, using cheaper equipment, reducing the shooting locations, the special/visual effects and the cast &amp; crew payments. But we cannot do it with less than $100,000. That's the absolute minimum required for this type of production. And just in case we don't even reach the minimum, have no worries, <strong>your contribution is not lost</strong>, we're gonna launch another campaign and/or find alternative ways of financing and make the movie no matter what!</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><a href=""https://adriantofei.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Adrian Țofei</a> did his first movie, <a href=""https://bemycatafilmforanne.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Be My Cat: A Film for Anne</i></a>, on a $10,000 budget, and the entire experience was <strong>traumatizing</strong> for everyone involved, despite all the awards and festivals and critical acclaim. Nobody was paid, they barely had money for food during filming, couldn't afford better equipment and visual effects, Adrian got anxiety because of doing everything by himself, couldn't submit the movie to more festivals, get a big distributor and reach a bigger audience, so it's definitely a situation we don't want to see repeating.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Update 1</strong>: We received a message from someone worried that the neo-conservatives might use the movie to point fingers at the LGBTQ community and accuse them of being violent. Creator Adrian Țofei was aware of this danger and that's why the film's characters are idealistic and non-violent, and their goal is positive. They won't go on a rampage. It will be a metaphysical quest for ending world's pain. If anyone will blame the left or the libertarians or the black community or the women or the LGBT community of being violent because of this movie, they will only expose their own stupidity.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Update 2</strong>: We've also received a concern about the way a male director might portray lesbians. Adrian Țofei is determined to not portray any stereotypes. Two women fall in love the same way two men fall in love the same way a woman and a man fall in love. He's also determined to not give the characters aggressive, war-oriented attributes. On the contrary - sensitivity, affection, care, vulnerability - the things that make us all wonderful. </p>

Updates:
1. Due to concerns from the LGBT and feminist communities, and also because of budgetary constraints and creative reasons, I've decided to drop the LGBT and feminist elements from We Put the World to Sleep's concept. Since the three main characters in the movie embark on a mission to bring everything to an end, we would have to be extremely careful to not portray the gays and the feminists as destructive, which would paralyse the creative process and wouldn't allow us to go fully psycho and do a really dangerous movie. So the best solution is to remove the LGBT and feminist elements from the concept to not risk harming those communities, and focus on the apocalyptic goal with no restraints. Adrian Țofei
2. You can now invest in We Put the World to Sleep, with a contract, and receive profit from the movie’s revenues, plus associate or executive producer credits, plus join the team at all the international film festivals! Check out the investment page for more info: weputtheworldtosleep.com/invest
3. Our Indiegogo campaign is over. Thanks a lot to all of you who supported it! We raised 1% of the movie's minimum $100,000 budget. We already have $10,000 from two investors, so we need $89,000 more to make the movie. And for that, Adrian Țofei decided to accept new investments. Let us know if you're interested in investing!
4. We're far from the minimum $100,000 goal, but we'll make the movie no matter what, by finding alternative ways of financing. Your contributions won't be lost! Every extra dollar matters and brings us closer to starting the production!
5. We'll do the movie in a way so that it cannot be used by the far-right to accuse the LGBTQ or the black community of being violent. The characters are idealistic and non-violent, their goal is positive, venturing on a metaphysical quest for ending world's pain.
6. Adrian Țofei is determined to not portray any lesbian stereotypes. Two women fall in love the same way two men fall in love the same way a woman and a man fall in love. He's also determined to not give the characters aggressive, war-oriented attributes. On the contrary - sensitivity, affection, care, vulnerability - the things that make us all wonderful. 
7. We didn't do a pitch video because we cannot be all together in it (Erisse lives in the US, Duru & Adrian live in Europe), and we do not have the time and the resources for a video that would reflect the movie's ambitions (we prefer using them for the actual film).
8. We've recently added cheaper perks and hidden the old ones that have been claimed, that's why most of them have zero claims now. Hidden claims: 1x$500, 1x$150, 2x$75, 3x$35, 1x$15. We add the IMDb credits in one to three days from being claimed.
What We Aim to Achieve
This movie has to shake the world. A world that is too comfortable in accepting the status-quo of discrimination, inequality, intolerance, speciesism, nationalism, pain, suffering, violence, abuse, irrational thinking, hypocrisy, corruption, greed, ignorance and so many other problems. The list never ends. And most likely it never will, since us as a species evolved via conflict/natural selection. We have it on our DNA. The capitalistic system is based on it. We cannot even enjoy a movie or a story that has no conflict. 
So we put together two women as the leads (the world loves male superiority), with different skin colors (the world loves white supremacy), different nationalities (the world loves nationalism), we make their characters lovers (the world loves heterosexuality only), we give them principles and ideals (the world loves messy thinking), and we make them save the world from its miserable existence by bringing everything to an end! (the world loves fighting for survival - the survival of the fittest and the crushing of the vulnerable)
We Put the World to Sleep has to premiere in one of the world's top film festivals (Cannes, Sundance, TIFF, Venice, Berlin, Telluride, SXSW, Tribeca), secure a top distributor, travel the festival circuit and enter movie theaters around the world. That's the only way it can make a difference. But it requires a relatively big budget, and no production company would invest money and let us do this dangerous movie the way we want, the way it should be done! 
For authenticity, Adrian Țofei plans to do it based on controlled improvisation, just like he did his first feature, the award-winning and critically-acclaimed Be My Cat: A Film for Anne. Because no writer can 100% imagine how an event or discussion evolves in real life, without putting himself in that situation. And also the actors would know in advance what will happen and what they have to say, they won't discover everything during filming, limiting the naturalness. And we don't want just good acting, we want audiences to be blown away by the authenticity, to say ""wow, are you sure this is just a movie? it looks so real!"". All this makes it very hard for us to do it with a production company. They want scripts. This and the movie's dangerous anti-system concept are the main reasons why we need and ask for your support! Join us in putting the world to sleep! 

Who We Are
Adrian Țofei | Actor & Filmmaker | Official Site | IMDb | Facebook | Twitter
We Put the World to Sleep: Director / Producer / Writer (concept) / Supporting Actor

Adrian Țofei was born on July 20, 1987 in Rădăuți, Romania. His mother, Dorina Țofei, supported him watching movies from an early age, and later, in adolescence, Adrian started spending hours each day researching film history as a hobby. He also took acting lessons, performed in high school plays and in 2007 went on to study Ion Cojar‘s acting method at Lower Danube University of Galați, then continued in 2010 with a master’s degree in acting at Spiru Haret University of Bucharest. During 2008-2010, Adrian also directed, produced, wrote and performed in various plays, most notably The Monster, a one-man-show which was selected to numerous theatre festivals.
At the end of 2012, inspired by the success of his one-man-show and a connection he made between Cojar’s method and the found footage concept, Adrian Țofei plunged into filmmaking and film acting as the director, producer, writer (concept) and star of Romania’s first found footage horror feature film, Be My Cat: A Film for Anne. The movie premiered at the 2015 Fantasporto International Film Festival and went on to win numerous awards and critical acclaim, including Best Film at the 2015 A Night of Horror International Film Festival in Sydney and Best Actor for Adrian at the 2016 Nashville Film Festival. I was called ""terrifying"" and ""a modern Peeping Tom"" by Austin Chronicle, ""potentially revolutionary and dangerous"" by Dread Central, a “disturbing  found footage masterpiece"" by 28DLA and “the most revolutionary found footage film since Blair Witch Project” by ANOH. It was also included in Dread Central's Top 5 Best Horror Movies of 2016, Blumhouse's Top 5 New Intelligent Found Footage Films You Need to See and Audiences Everywhere's Top 50 Best Horror Movies of the 2000s. Artsploitation said that Adrian did ""the most believable movie psychopath since Normal Bates"". Adrian Țofei is currently developing We Put the World to Sleep and he's also set to direct the upcoming female antihero thriller drama Good Girl.
Erisse Peterson | Actress & Musician | IMDb | Facebook | Twitter
We Put the World to Sleep: Lead Actress (playing Erika) (improvised audition below)

Erisse Peterson was born on March 7th, 1993 in Stone Mountain, Georgia, USA. She got her start in acting at an early age, after her family relocated to Los Angeles, California in 1996. As a child actor, Erisse was represented by Bob Feldman (father of actor Corey Feldman) and studied ballet, tap and jazz dance.
Later, Erisse Peterson attended Mississippi School of the Arts, the state’s only residential arts high school. She intensively studied theatre arts under her instructors, Dr. Robert Brooks and Tammy Stanford, and performed in numerous stage plays. She also developed a passion for all aspects of film, including directing and film scoring. During 2011-2013, Erisse attended Mississippi State University, where she studied Philosophy & Religion. Erisse Peterson joined We Put the World to Sleep in 2015, when the project was called I Put the World to Sleep, after winning the international casting call (check out her powerful improvised audition above). She recently ventured into music as well, releasing her first EP, Somethingmissing, under the stage name Planes. 
Duru Yücel Țofei | Actress & Screenwriter | IMDb | Facebook | Twitter
We Put the World to Sleep: Lead Actress (playing Deniz)

Duru Yücel Țofei was born on July 16th, 1986 in Izmir, Turkey. A very expressive child, she always had a playful existence which later proved itself when she sang in front of the whole class in primary school and staged impressions of all her teachers during secondary school. She studied theatre for a year when she was 10, which led to her playing two different characters in the play that was staged at the end of the year. From that moment on, she came to know very clearly the fact that she wanted to be an actress.
Having inherited her mother’s talent in languages, Duru also developed a similar interest and chose to study English-Turkish Interpretation and Translation in college. But her biggest passion never stopped haunting her, and following the university years, in order to have an acting training and bigger opportunities, she moved from Izmir to Istanbul and enrolled at The Studio Players, where she received three years of acting and art education under Şahika Tekand and Esat Tekand. In 2014, she performed multiple times in the play named Becoming A Rhinoceros 2.014 with The Studio Players. During 2012-2017, Duru also acted in various TV series, commercials, and a short movie which traveled to Cannes. She also likes singing, especially jazz, and has a demo she handed out just to her family and friends. Duru Yucel Țofei is currently preparing for her role in We Put the World to Sleep and also co-writing the script for the upcoming feature film Good Girl.

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><i>We Are Like Waves</i> is an intimate, powerful story that the world needs now. This story will shed light on the continued push for gender equality in the sport of surfing, and demonstrates how surfing can be used as a tool for <strong>women’s empowerment. </strong>Not only is Sanu a role model for the young girls in her village, but through the screen, she will become a role model for girls and women. We aim to create a platform for deeper discussions around gender norms, beauty standards, and family expectations within the context of surfing. </p>
<p>This story is not just Sanu’s, it is <strong>the story of many female surfers around the world.</strong></p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Along the South Coast of Sri Lanka, surfing is everywhere. Yet only foreigners and local men fill the lineups.<strong> Surfing is not seen as a sport for Sri Lankan girls. </strong>This is a result of cultural and societal expectations that often place women inside the household, particularly in rural areas. Young girls are expected to follow certain standards: Attend school, study, work. Get married, and start a family. Be a housewife, cook, and clean. Most importantly, stay at home and put family first.</p>
<p><strong>The ocean is simply not seen as a place for women</strong>. Therefore, like most girls, Sanu grew up watching her brother surf, but never considered it as an option for herself. When Sanu turned 18, she began working in the kitchen at a surf camp alongside her brother, who worked as a surf instructor.</p>
<p>At the surf camp, Sanu was often invited to try surfing by foreigners, but her fear of the ocean and going against her community’s expectations made her decline the offer again and again. One day, Sanu was asked by her boss and mentor, Sophie, to join her at <strong><a href=""https://www.seasisterslk.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SeaSisters</a></strong>, a weekly swim and surf program established  for Sri Lankan girls to help inspire and empower through surfing. Hesitant but curious,<strong> Sanu took the risk.</strong></p>
<p>This is a story of <strong>finding one’s voice in a sea of expectations.</strong></p>

During the attempted coup of 1990, members of the Jamaat Al Muslimeen, a local radical Islamic group, raided the Parliament, bombed the police headquarters, commandeered the national television station, TTT, and killed several people (the exact number is still not known).</p><p>In the four-part documentary series, ‘1990’, award-winning filmmaker and television producer, Mariel Brown, will explore the issues that gave rise to the 1990 coup attempt; take an in depth look at each day of the stand-off – in the Red House and Trinidad and Tobago Television, and in Port of Spain as a whole – which culminated in Abu Bakr’s surrender; examine the effect of the resulting amnesty and other court cases around the Muslimeen; and try to highlight the scars left on both the people who were directly involved, and the national community.<br/> </p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616101284/iimlagvyp6pswxjwkylb.png"" src=""""/></h3><p>The 1990 coup attempt has always held a fascination for me, and as a documentary filmmaker and a Trinidadian who lived through it, I have wanted to explore the story for many years. In 2008, I made an abortive attempt to start the research, but I was younger then, and, I realise now, not ready to undertake the telling of such a difficult story. </p><p>I picked up the mantle again in 2018 — determined to make a series to mark the 30th anniversary of what is now known colloquially as, ‘the coup’. But attempts to raise money for the production through corporate sponsors in Trinidad have proven depressingly, if understandably, futile. I wrote a post on Facebook, in July of 2020, sharing my desire to make the series, and was so pleased to get some really encouraging feedback. One comment, in particular, struck me. Calypsonian David Rudder wrote, ‘Just after the coup, a lady came up to my home and begged me to write the ultimate song, aimed specifically at the young people of the nation. The song, she said, when played, and [heard by] the nation, will wipe out all knowledge of the coup. I’ll never forget the look on her face when I explained to her why I had to decline.’ </p><p>Difficult and painful histories — I can understand why the idea of forgetting is so attractive. And yet, how can we forget the coup? I keep coming back to the fact that people, citizens of Trinidad and Tobago, our people, were killed during the attempted coup; and many others were profoundly damaged during those terrible days. And yet, over thirty years on, we’re still not sure how many were killed.  As columnist BC Pires wrote in 2007, ‘17 years after they died, we have no idea how many people were killed by the Muslimeen. But it is a source of ongoing distraction to me, and must be a deep, unresolved pain to their loved ones.</p><p>‘On this anniversary day of the day, then, two things come to mind… The other point, or nine, depending on how, or even if, you count them, are: Leo Des Vignes; George Francis; SRP George; Loraine Caballero; Solomon McCleod; Malcolm Basanta; Arthur Guiseppi; Mervyn Teague; the people we know for sure were killed in 1990.’</p><p>For me, making ‘1990’ is about honouring, remembering, marking, questioning, understanding and never forgetting what was done to us and taken away from us that year.</p><p> </p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616101414/nsqciiew0ncx5pylo9di.png"" src=""""/></h3><p>We've assembled a small and hardworking team of researchers in Trinidad, and we're delighted with the progress they have made, fleshing out a detailed timeline of the decade of the attempted coup; sourcing and reviewing endless hours of archive footage, thanks to the support of Banyan Archives, Pixel Play Media and Visual Arts; visiting the national archives, the national library and various media houses. </p><p>Fundraising efforts are ongoing, as we continue to reach out to corporate sponsors in Trinidad and Tobago, in the hopes that one or two companies will see the value in telling this story and give financial support. In the mean time, SAVANT Films has self-funded the research and development phase, and planning a crowdfunding campaign to help offset research and production costs later this month. It's essential that we succeed with the crowdfunding campaign to advance work on this project, and look forward to your support!</p><p><br/>To find out more, do follow us on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter @1990docseries</p><p> </p><h3>Risks and challenges</h3><p>The risks and challenges for this project revolve around the complexity of the story itself and my ability to attract sponsorship and grants to the project. As we dig deeper into the story, we are uncovering layers and layers of context, which must be fully explored in the series, as well as many, many first hand accounts of experiences from people either directly or tangentially involved. Indeed, this is a lovely problem to have! In producing historical documentaries, it's not often the case that one has access to so many first hand accounts! The process of pre-interviews which we recently concluded has been invaluable in helping guide the arc of the story, and broadening my understanding of the many facets of the coup.</p><p>The circumstances that gave rise to 'the coup' have their roots in the 1970s and the struggle for black power, and extend through to the party of 'national unity', the NAR, the fateful 1986 elections, and the recession of the 1980s. As a result, research has taken longer than I originally anticipated, but I expect to have completed this process by mid to late April.</p><p>As an independent filmmaker, I have been creating and producing independently funded television shows and documentary films for the better part of 20 years. All of my projects have required that I do extensive fundraising, and I've not let this fact deter me from completing those projects, often through sheer determination and stick-with-it-ness (my last film, Unfinished Sentences, took four years to fundraise for, and I was able to meet my full budget)! My hope is that as the visibility of this project grows, so too will my capacity to fundraise through sponsorship and grants.

During the attempted coup of 1990, members of the Jamaat Al Muslimeen, a local radical Islamic group, raided the Parliament, bombed the police headquarters, commandeered the national television station, TTT, and killed several people (the exact number is still not known).In the four-part documentary series, ‘1990’, award-winning filmmaker and television producer, Mariel Brown, will explore the issues that gave rise to the 1990 coup attempt; take an in depth look at each day of the stand-off – in the Red House and Trinidad and Tobago Television, and in Port of Spain as a whole – which culminated in Abu Bakr’s surrender; examine the effect of the resulting amnesty and other court cases around the Muslimeen; and try to highlight the scars left on both the people who were directly involved, and the national community. The 1990 coup attempt has always held a fascination for me, and as a documentary filmmaker and a Trinidadian who lived through it, I have wanted to explore the story for many years. In 2008, I made an abortive attempt to start the research, but I was younger then, and, I realise now, not ready to undertake the telling of such a difficult story. I picked up the mantle again in 2018 — determined to make a series to mark the 30th anniversary of what is now known colloquially as, ‘the coup’. But attempts to raise money for the production through corporate sponsors in Trinidad have proven depressingly, if understandably, futile. I wrote a post on Facebook, in July of 2020, sharing my desire to make the series, and was so pleased to get some really encouraging feedback. One comment, in particular, struck me. Calypsonian David Rudder wrote, ‘Just after the coup, a lady came up to my home and begged me to write the ultimate song, aimed specifically at the young people of the nation. The song, she said, when played, and [heard by] the nation, will wipe out all knowledge of the coup. I’ll never forget the look on her face when I explained to her why I had to decline.’ Difficult and painful histories — I can understand why the idea of forgetting is so attractive. And yet, how can we forget the coup? I keep coming back to the fact that people, citizens of Trinidad and Tobago, our people, were killed during the attempted coup; and many others were profoundly damaged during those terrible days. And yet, over thirty years on, we’re still not sure how many were killed.  As columnist BC Pires wrote in 2007, ‘17 years after they died, we have no idea how many people were killed by the Muslimeen. But it is a source of ongoing distraction to me, and must be a deep, unresolved pain to their loved ones.‘On this anniversary day of the day, then, two things come to mind… The other point, or nine, depending on how, or even if, you count them, are: Leo Des Vignes; George Francis; SRP George; Loraine Caballero; Solomon McCleod; Malcolm Basanta; Arthur Guiseppi; Mervyn Teague; the people we know for sure were killed in 1990.’For me, making ‘1990’ is about honouring, remembering, marking, questioning, understanding and never forgetting what was done to us and taken away from us that year. We've assembled a small and hardworking team of researchers in Trinidad, and we're delighted with the progress they have made, fleshing out a detailed timeline of the decade of the attempted coup; sourcing and reviewing endless hours of archive footage, thanks to the support of Banyan Archives, Pixel Play Media and Visual Arts; visiting the national archives, the national library and various media houses. Fundraising efforts are ongoing, as we continue to reach out to corporate sponsors in Trinidad and Tobago, in the hopes that one or two companies will see the value in telling this story and give financial support. In the mean time, SAVANT Films has self-funded the research and development phase, and planning a crowdfunding campaign to help offset research and production costs later this month. It's essential that we succeed with the crowdfunding campaign to advance work on this project, and look forward to your support!To find out more, do follow us on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter @1990docseries Risks and challengesThe risks and challenges for this project revolve around the complexity of the story itself and my ability to attract sponsorship and grants to the project. As we dig deeper into the story, we are uncovering layers and layers of context, which must be fully explored in the series, as well as many, many first hand accounts of experiences from people either directly or tangentially involved. Indeed, this is a lovely problem to have! In producing historical documentaries, it's not often the case that one has access to so many first hand accounts! The process of pre-interviews which we recently concluded has been invaluable in helping guide the arc of the story, and broadening my understanding of the many facets of the coup.The circumstances that gave rise to 'the coup' have their roots in the 1970s and the struggle for black power, and extend through to the party of 'national unity', the NAR, the fateful 1986 elections, and the recession of the 1980s. As a result, research has taken longer than I originally anticipated, but I expect to have completed this process by mid to late April.As an independent filmmaker, I have been creating and producing independently funded television shows and documentary films for the better part of 20 years. All of my projects have required that I do extensive fundraising, and I've not let this fact deter me from completing those projects, often through sheer determination and stick-with-it-ness (my last film, Unfinished Sentences, took four years to fundraise for, and I was able to meet my full budget)! My hope is that as the visibility of this project grows, so too will my capacity to fundraise through sponsorship and grants. It's a difficult story, but most everyone I have spoken to about it has recognised its importance, and because of this, I anticipate that I will also receive many cash donations towards the project – in fact, I have already begun the process of soliciting personal donations. I expect that my budget will be made in this way – as a combination of crowdfunding, direct donations, sponsorship and grants.",11.0,0,"6 Campaigns

<h3><strong>Short Summary</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Creator</strong></p>
<p>Yorgo Glynatsis is the writer, co-director and lead actor of TRIGGER. He is a Greek, Italian filmmaker born in Belgium and started his artistic journey at 14 years old acting in Belgium. He trained in Theatre at the Conservatoire of Charleroi and played several leads and supporting roles in theatre shows in Brussels. Aspiring for an international career, he moved to London in 2014 and joined the cast of the Immersive project <i>The Den</i> created by the BAFTA-winning director Gbemisola Ikumelo. Following that, he starred in several short films and Indian Features. Recently, he shot the feature film pilot of <i>The Adamant Vultures of London</i> and the feature film <i>Remi Milligan: Lost Director</i>. His passion for filmmaking started in 2020 when he created a series of comedy sketches, <i>Donovan the Stalker</i>, and several scenes before writing <i>TRIGGER</i>.</p>
<p>Inspired by watching the series <i>I May Destroy You</i> and <i>It’s a Sin</i>, he decided to talk about his traumatic experience from a few years ago in London. Feeling ashamed for allowing the experience to happen to him, he failed to report it or even tell anyone at the time.</p>
<p>He has now decided to speak up about sexual consent and the misinformation that surrounds it. As this topic is still considered taboo in our society, many people remain silent, suffering their trauma alone. Many LGBTQI+ people, himself included, struggle with their self-esteem and identity. This makes LGBTQI+ people, in particular, more vulnerable and prone to uncomfortable situations. Yorgo wants to normalise speaking up about this subject and raise awareness about the meaning of consent.</p>
<p>Making this short film is a healing journey for Yorgo and will hopefully inspire others to use their voices. Together we can create a safer world for our generation and the ones to follow.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1626170742/jj72ymz94lqanlsmrqww.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Co-Director Statement</strong></p>
<p>The concept of sexual consent only recently began to be discussed in mainstream media, raising significant awareness but still lacking essential information. Sexual assault is often understood as forced, violent sex, and this film represents the other version less spoken about. I believe it is vital to represent the realities of sexual assault, the different ways it appears and is perceived. Non-violent sexual assault is a huge and unspoken issue in the LGBTQI+ community, with 40% of gay men and 47% of bisexual men have experienced sexual violence other than rape, compared to 21% of straight men. Around half of transgender people and bisexual women will experience sexual violence at some point in their lifetimes. Now is the right time to raise these issues, when people are more open to discussing and understanding them. </p>
<p>I am passionate about representing real people in my work. My prior work focused on documentaries, but I have always admired how non-factual films can tell true stories. It allows the creatives to experiment with storytelling while maintaining the truth of the experience. I explored this when writing and directing ‘Mora’, a short film about sleep paralysis, based on my experiences, told through a character’s story. I want to continue to make more films that address critical issues, such as my documentary about menstrual stigma. This story combines two issues I care about deeply, LGBTQI+ rights and sexual abuse. These are both very personal to me, and I believe the best work always comes from that.</p>

<p><strong>Synopsis</strong></p>
<p>Anthony, a twenty-nine-year-old mixed European actor and cabin crew member, auditions for the reality TV show ‘Dream Island.’ The casting director immediately asks stereotypical questions; about his sexual orientation and consequently his taste in men. The questions become darker and more disturbing, triggering a flashback to a London house party, and a traumatic event in his life.</p>

She is particularly passionate about the representation of women and LGBTQI+ people in film and aims to contribute towards increased and accurate representation.</p>
<p><strong>Producer</strong></p>
<p>Lisa Geurts is originally from the Netherlands but has lived in England for nearly 10 years. Having originally studied and specialised in the craft of Screenwriting, and while she is still persuing that, when she started getting the opportunity to produce and direct her own short films, she took the chance and since then hasn’t looked back. Lisa is particularly interested in the correct representations of less represented groups in films. She is also currently researching mental health representations in horror films, and television and hopes that this research will be valuable for screenwriters in navigating this.</p>

<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>We are looking to raise around 10K for the film. This will ensure that Yorgo's vision can become a reality and that we can reach as many people as possible. The budget includes distribution to the relevant national and international festivals, as well as compensating all our cast and crew fairly for their work.</p>
<p>Even if we don't reach our goal, we will still try to make this film, simplifying the script if necessary. We think the message we are trying to convey, and the awareness we are trying to raise is so important, that we would rather make the film on a small budget than not at all.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>We would be so incredibly grateful for any help you can provide. The whole team whole heartedly believes in this project, and believe that if there was more awareness around sexual consent, in particular in the LGBTQI+ community, that more people would speak out. We don't just want to make a film for us, we want to make it for everyone.</p>
<p>Once the short has done the rounds at national, and international festivals, we plan to use it as a proof of concept in order to get greenlit to make this into a limited series, giving the story additional time to explore different themes. Some themes we wish to explore in the future when fleshing out this story are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of self-esteem and self-love in young people in the LGBTQI+ community</li>
<li>Sex and drug addictions</li>
<li>Lack of commitment in relationships</li>
<li>Sexual consent</li>
<li>Depression</li>
<li>Suicide and toxic relationships within the LGBTQI+ community.</li>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As experienced filmmakers, we know it won't be an easy ride. We have already had to overcome challenges, and that's before even launching this campaign!</p>
<p>One challenge will be not receiving the funds we'd like. The budget is based on the current screenplay, and the ideal crew and locations to do the screenplay and Yorgo's vision justice. However, we have already created three separate ""what if"" budgets. While we hope we can make the film we want to make, we want to ensure that your money is used in the best way, and we are already looking and will continue to look at ways to make any money we receive stretch as far as possible.</p>
<p>Another risk is what would happen if COVID-19 cases go up again, and if there would be another lockdown. Most of us have worked on film sets and have experience keeping sets Covid Safe, including our trailer shoot. Our crew will also have up to date ScreenSkills certificates in 'Coronavirus Awareness on Set'. When we shot our trailer, we stuck to a group of six people indoors, and all got tested within 24 hours prior to shooting. All members of the cast and crew also signed agreements to ensure COVID safety on set, but also to ensure the reporting of positive tests or contact within 10 days of the shoot. Once we know what the rules around COVID will be when we start shooting (this Autumn), we will do a risk assessment and ensure our cast &amp; crew's safety.</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>A short film that explores control and freedom...</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""<u>The Hum</u> is a name often given to widespread reports of a persistent and invasive low-frequency humming, rumbling, or droning noise not audible to all people.""</i><br/>- Wikipedia</p>
<p>Monotone. Dull. Normal. Evelyn's existence is all of these things and nothing more.</p>
<p>That is until she becomes aware of a humming noise. It starts to dominate her otherwise normal life. Driven to distraction, she hunts frantically for the source. When she finds an ominous metal box from which the hum emanates, her decision to ignore the simple warning sign – ‘Don’t’ – will have a lasting effect on her life, exposing the comfortably sinister, frighteningly normal forces that control our lives.</p>

</div><p> </p><h3>Director's Message</h3><p>Hi! </p><p>Welcome to this, the campaign page for DON'T: a short film project the story for which has been kicking around in my head for more years than I’m willing to count. Stories can be weird, tricksy things that defy being nailed down. They can build you up with their potential, only to turn your brain to mush as they refuse to reveal the way the story should be told. Short story? Mmmm, not quite right. Comic? Nah – too long for a short one, too short for a long one. Weird indie video game? Much as I love ‘em, oh heck no.</p><p>The final form came after I started adapting it into an adventure for a certain Time Lord (not an official adventure, I hasten to add). It suddenly struck me that it was all in my head as something filmed, not written and read. D’oh! So obvious.</p><p>And here we are. DON'T, the short film.</p><p>I am stupidly excited to be announcing over the coming weeks the cast and crew we’ve put together for this project.

There was considerable delight amongst ‘Star Wars’ fans in particular when, in 2016, Angus returned to voice Gold Leader Jon ‘Dutch’ Vander in ‘Rogue One: A Star Wars Story’, with unused footage of his 1970’s self from the original film used to bring the character back to the big screen.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616403104/g6ot4ydpioha4tnsl5ww.png"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>EUAN DUTHIE</strong></p><p>Euan is a QC at the Scottish Bar and a tribunal judge.

A short film that explores control and freedom...
""The Hum is a name often given to widespread reports of a persistent and invasive low-frequency humming, rumbling, or droning noise not audible to all people.""- Wikipedia
Monotone. Dull. Normal. Evelyn's existence is all of these things and nothing more.
That is until she becomes aware of a humming noise. It starts to dominate her otherwise normal life. Driven to distraction, she hunts frantically for the source. When she finds an ominous metal box from which the hum emanates, her decision to ignore the simple warning sign – ‘Don’t’ – will have a lasting effect on her life, exposing the comfortably sinister, frighteningly normal forces that control our lives.
 

 Director's MessageHi! Welcome to this, the campaign page for DON'T: a short film project the story for which has been kicking around in my head for more years than I’m willing to count. Stories can be weird, tricksy things that defy being nailed down. They can build you up with their potential, only to turn your brain to mush as they refuse to reveal the way the story should be told. Short story? Mmmm, not quite right. Comic? Nah – too long for a short one, too short for a long one. Weird indie video game? Much as I love ‘em, oh heck no.The final form came after I started adapting it into an adventure for a certain Time Lord (not an official adventure, I hasten to add). It suddenly struck me that it was all in my head as something filmed, not written and read. D’oh! So obvious.And here we are. DON'T, the short film.I am stupidly excited to be announcing over the coming weeks the cast and crew we’ve put together for this project. The chance to bring you along on the adventure is a gloriously intimidating thing, but it is going to be so much fun. And work. But fun work. You’ll see what I mean. And not just on this particular film, not just on DON'T. We’ve got others planned, Stewart and I, and we’re looking forward to letting the backers of this one in on those too. Onward!Be well, be safe, be excited!Supplemental:I'm very excited to confirm that filming of 'Don't' will go ahead.

The comfort and safety of our cast and crew is the highest priority for us, and we will delay shooting until we can be confident that everything will be safe for all involved. Other Ways You Can HelpRight now we are all going through hardships and challenges that are bringing difficulties in ways that couldn't be imagined just a few years ago. We understand that giving a contribution to this project may not be possible, but if you believe in what we're doing and want to see it become a reality, then sharing is the next best thing! We'd be grateful for any exposure you can give us by sharing this campaign and making some noise about what we're creating all over your own social media channels and websites. Thank YouWe cannot thank you enough for your contribution to this project.
