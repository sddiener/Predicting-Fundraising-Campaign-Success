</div><h3>12 Guardians Christian Thriller Book Series</h3><p>The 12 
Guardians is a book series I started writing early in 2013. I have just 
finished publishing book 5, and I'm about 50,000 words into book 11.</p><h3><strong>12 Guardians</strong></h3><p>Hand chosen to guard Jesus, 
putting everything on the line, so Jesus is protected. No sacrifice is 
too big or small. They must survive the weekend so they can rescue John 
the Baptist.</p><p><strong>The Sixx</strong></p><p>Evil incarnate, dedicated to making sure Jesus doesn’t make it to the crucifixion and none of the Guardians make it either.</p><p><b>Descriptions of each book -</b></p><p><b>12 Guardians (the first 3) includes Books 1-3</b></p><p>The Sixx are evil incarnate. Their mission is to alter history by 
ensuring Jesus is never crucified – changing the world as we know it. In
 their way stand The Guardians, intent on stopping them by any means 
necessary.
<br/><br/>When things go bad in Hazard, Kentucky, veteran Guardians Salome and
 Saul recruit David Sigmond, an ER nurse, and Isaac Smyth, a children’s 
preacher, to their cause. The new Guardians are drawn into a dangerous 
adventure when The Sixx attack right before their very eyes. With new 
skills and powers thrust upon them, they find themselves journeying 
further from home than they could ever have imagined – over 2000 years 
back in time.
<br/><br/>Scattered through the ages, the haphazard group do what they can to 
thwart The Sixx; Isaac and Salome are sent to protect John the Baptist, 
teaming up with Guardian Shagmar along the way. David is sent on his 
Reckoning, where he finds an ally Guardian Miriam. Saul is stuck in 
present times, dealing with the loss of his Guardian powers, but still 
doing what he can to combat their deadly foe. But will all of the 
Guardians survive their personal battles and The Sixx?
<br/></p><p><b>Book 4 - The Nest - also includes the short story Austin</b></p><p>The Sixx are building an impenetrable fortress, deep underground: the Nest.
<br/><br/>But the Guardians have other problems. Salome is forced to confront 
her loss as she packs up the home she shared with her late husband, Abe.
 David discovers his wife has a shocking secret and Isaac finds it hard 
to tear himself away from his best friend’s widow, after speaking at his
 funeral. Ex-Guardian Saul is forced to team up with an unlikely ally: a
 man who tried to kill him, under the instruction of the Sixx 
themselves.
<br/><br/>Together, they plot to infiltrate the Nest, to retrieve four 
Guardian bracelets, stolen by the Sixx over thirty years ago. But along 
the way, they discover another plot, more hideous than any of them could
 ever have imagined.
<b><br/></b></p><p><b>Book 5 - Abraham - In the Beginning</b></p><p>Ex-guardian Saul learns about his new driving friend Zig while the pair 
transport the Guardians to a safe place for their jump.  
<br/><br/>David and Miriam manage to co-ordinate their jump to meet up in the 
times of Jesus and spend their trip tending Miriam’s flock. But when her
 replacement is murdered and they have unexpected visitors in the night,
 they may not be in for the relaxing jump 
they anticipated.
<br/><br/>New Guardians Ben and Aly are sent on their Reckoning, their mission
 to protect a young boy and his family from the Sixx’s interference. But
 the young boy has an important future and the Sixx resources are thick 
on the ground, which proves to be 
quite a daunting task for the newest duo.
<b><br/></b></p><p><b>Book 6 - Traitor</b><br/></p>The book we're working on finishing now. There is a traitor in the Guardians, who is it and what damage has been done...<br/><br/>So
 why are we running an Indiegogo campaign? It takes money to get the 
books from my computer to the hands of my readers, and I hope you can 
help me do just that.<br/><br/><h3>The Formats</h3><p>We offer our books and you can buy them in several different formats.</p><p>Digital download - available - every format, every type of reader file.  We will email this file to you.</p><p>Paper Back - Digital plus - we'll mail you a USB drives which contain the book files.</p><p>One for you one to giveaway - Two copies of the paperback and two usb drives.</p><p>The Saint - paperback, one USB drive and your name in the credits of whatever books you buy (books 6-12)</p><p>All paperback books are signed.<br/></p><h3>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name Sri Sri Sri Jaya Jaya Myra Parameshwari Devi.  I'm the Founder &amp; Director of <strong><a href=""http://www.gitaforthemasses.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gita for the Masses</a></strong>.  We are a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization created to share sacred consciousness teachings which help people overcome obstacles and be victorious in life.</p>
<p>I'm creating a very unique and revolutionary training course called Making Life a Living Victory, based on the message of the Bhagavad-Gita but interpreted from a Maha Shakti, Divine Mother empowerment viewpoint!  Gita has NEVER been looked at in this way before, but here, is shows a clear approach to character development and empowered living! <strong><em>Perhaps e</em><em>ven more important for global change, it shows a path towards interreligious dialogue, interfaith harmony and consciousness-based empowerment in life.</em></strong></p>
<p>When looked at as an inner path of psychological and emotional growth, Gita becomes applicable to a person of any religion or belief system as a way to grow and develop ones character, strength of will and clarity of life.  When looked at from a Shakti viewpoint, it becomes even more applicable to modern, material life as a way to deeply connect with Spirit, God or Self.</p>
<p>The Making Life a Living Victory course is a 75-hour course of study, with 25-30 hours of in class time and 45-50 hours of individual study.  <strong>This same book that we are creating for this course will also serve as the main manual for a second more in-depth, expanded 225-hour course of study we anticipate developing by 2016!</strong><br/><br/></p>
<h3>Why This Project is Important</h3>
<p>1. <strong>We have just as many problems in the West as the developing countries do</strong>.  We have successful people and lots of money in society, but a culture of greed, egoism, apathy and fend for yourself.  <strong>THIS MUST CHANGE!</strong>  People need to be taught the roots of character development, and <strong>HOW</strong> to go about making decisions in life that help both the individual and society progress.  The world cannot change until people learn how to have character!</p>
<p>2. <strong>No one has ever shown the dynamic Shakti side of Gita.</strong>  <b>Ever.</b> Gita has typically been translated from a transcendentalist or renunicate viewpoint, which does not show the power of its message for individual development and social change from an all-of-life embracing perspective. </p>
<p>Looking from an integrated perspective of both the transcendental and Shakti perspectives combined shows a timeless message applicable to everyone as a way to grow in life and deeply connect with God, consciousness or a person's highest Self.  It is directly applicable to the Western way of life as a householder, parent, spouse, career holder and person desiring to make change in the world.  It also has a huge message to show in interfaith harmony, inter-religious dialogue and the importance of Self-development for societal change. <br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>3. <strong>The sacred philosophy teachings are not in the mainstream!</strong>  Yoga (asana) is, but when you get down to how you work with the mind and emotions directly, off the mat, not so much!  This course is designed to change that and is perfect for integration into existing teacher training courses.<strong> <br/></strong></p>
<h3><strong>My Career Background<br/></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>I run a communications consulting company (Myra Godfrey Consulting Inc.), helping people and businesses craft conscious communication and brand strategies.<br/>
</li>
<li>Strong background in non-profit management and development work (over 7 years of Director level experience).</li>
<li>Over 12 years of experience in crafting targeted communications strategies.</li>
<li>I am an <em><strong>internationally published writer and speaker</strong></em> on spirituality and consciousness! I have recent articles in both the highly acclaimed <em><strong>Yoga Magazine</strong></em> and <em><strong>Tathaastu: So Be It! Magazine</strong></em>.</li>
<li>
<em><strong>I have spoken on women's empowerment and spirituality at the United Nations</strong></em> for their week of spirituality and for International Women's Day.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find more about my individual consciousness and healing work and find my writings on my personal website <strong><a href=""http://www.hridaya-healing.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hridaya Healing</a></strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>My Spiritual Background</strong></h3>
<p>I grew up always being closely connected with God.  When I reached my late 20's I met my first Guru/teacher and took mantra initiation.  This is also where I extensively studied the Gita, learned about meditation and consciousness.</p>
<p>This led to many direct realization experiences and to connecting directly to Source and God through my own heart.  My Guru guided me to go out, teach and to trust my inner guidance because it was clear.</p>
<p>After starting the practice of Sri Vidya (which my inner guidance led me to), the Divine Mother herself came and initiated me into her Panchadasi and Shodasi mantras.  Later, I received full inititation into Sri Vidya, with the caveat from that Guru (Amritananda Natha) that Mother alone was my guide and to keep deepening the realization in my own heart.    I was given the guidance to teach and share what I knew and what I would learn with the world!</p>
<p>
</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>Individually:</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn how powerful the intellect is for shaping your whole life.</li>
<li>How to identify your life purpose and go about fulfilling it.</li>
<li>Inner contemplation and transformation tools.</li>
<li>Self-accountability for thoughts, feelings and actions in life.</li>

<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Inter-religious dialogue and interfaith harmony!</li>
<li>Peace-building through fighting the inner war, not the outer one.</li>
<li>Social Change by creating empowered, authentic individuals!</li>
<li>Promote the inherent Oneness between diverse cultures and people</li>
<li>Anti-bullying.</li>
<li>Anti-violence.</li>
<li>Women's empowerment through understanding their core Shakti energy.</li>
<li>A new integrated look at spirituality that embraces all of life.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>This is truly a revolutionary project</strong>; no one is doing anything like this!  No one is teaching this.  No one has looked at it in quite this way before....and this has the power to change the lives of people in the West for the better.  It has the potential to re-conceptualize the way people relate to their spirituality and core empowered self.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>There are many ways you can get involved!  Here are some creative ideas for you: </p>
<ul>
<li>Share on your social media pages!  Let people know about this powerful and one of a kind work! Indiegogo has great built-in share tools! Check them out!</li>
<li>Contact your local media: people always want to know more about positive, unique projects, especially when they involve empowerment, peace-building, and social change!</li>
<li>Tell your local religious or spiritual community!  Tell your community leaders dedicated to social change!  We look to build dynamic, fulfilling partnerships!</li>
<li>Talk to other inspired change-makers and spread the world! </li>
</ul>

2. No one has ever shown the dynamic Shakti side of Gita.  Ever. Gita has typically been translated from a transcendentalist or renunicate viewpoint, which does not show the power of its message for individual development and social change from an all-of-life embracing perspective. 
Looking from an integrated perspective of both the transcendental and Shakti perspectives combined shows a timeless message applicable to everyone as a way to grow in life and deeply connect with God, consciousness or a person's highest Self.  It is directly applicable to the Western way of life as a householder, parent, spouse, career holder and person desiring to make change in the world.  It also has a huge message to show in interfaith harmony, inter-religious dialogue and the importance of Self-development for societal change. 


3. The sacred philosophy teachings are not in the mainstream!  Yoga (asana) is, but when you get down to how you work with the mind and emotions directly, off the mat, not so much!  This course is designed to change that and is perfect for integration into existing teacher training courses. 
My Career Background

I run a communications consulting company (Myra Godfrey Consulting Inc.), helping people and businesses craft conscious communication and brand strategies.

Strong background in non-profit management and development work (over 7 years of Director level experience).
Over 12 years of experience in crafting targeted communications strategies.
I am an internationally published writer and speaker on spirituality and consciousness! I have recent articles in both the highly acclaimed Yoga Magazine and Tathaastu: So Be It! Magazine.

I have spoken on women's empowerment and spirituality at the United Nations for their week of spirituality and for International Women's Day.

You can find more about my individual consciousness and healing work and find my writings on my personal website Hridaya Healing.
My Spiritual Background
I grew up always being closely connected with God.  When I reached my late 20's I met my first Guru/teacher and took mantra initiation.  This is also where I extensively studied the Gita, learned about meditation and consciousness.
This led to many direct realization experiences and to connecting directly to Source and God through my own heart.  My Guru guided me to go out, teach and to trust my inner guidance because it was clear.
After starting the practice of Sri Vidya (which my inner guidance led me to), the Divine Mother herself came and initiated me into her Panchadasi and Shodasi mantras.  Later, I received full inititation into Sri Vidya, with the caveat from that Guru (Amritananda Natha) that Mother alone was my guide and to keep deepening the realization in my own heart.    I was given the guidance to teach and share what I knew and what I would learn with the world!


What We Need & What You Get
We need to raise $11,000 to get the development of this course started and to increase our ability to reach more people with its message! Your donations will help with:

A real-world ad campaign in NYC focusing on self-empowerment and character development, as originationg form the core Self.
Discussion time with religious leaders of diverse faiths for the commentary section of this book, discussing inter-religious diaogue and interfaith harmony!
Art design for the workbook, including cover and back design.
Some writing time!  Over half of the work is already completed, including the Sanskrit translation! We need to write the commentary and get everything ready for the printing process.
Copyright and Trademark registration for the course.
Overall project and operating support for Gita for the Masses to successfully launch this new course! 

We've developed a very robust rewards program for you....and since we are a non-profit, your contributions will also be tax-deductable! 
Take a look at all of the rewards.  If you have any questions, contact us directly!  I am happy to talk with you by phone or e-mail.  You can find all of the contact info directly on the Gita for the Masses website here: www.gitaforthemasses.org. 


The Impact
Individually:




Learn how powerful the intellect is for shaping your whole life.
How to identify your life purpose and go about fulfilling it.
Inner contemplation and transformation tools.
Self-accountability for thoughts, feelings and actions in life.
Psychological, emotional and consciousness growth.
Self-empowerment and character development.
Learn about the Shakti, feminine energies as they impact the psyche.


On a large scale:



Inter-religious dialogue and interfaith harmony!
Peace-building through fighting the inner war, not the outer one.
Social Change by creating empowered, authentic individuals!
Promote the inherent Oneness between diverse cultures and people
Anti-bullying.
Anti-violence.
Women's empowerment through understanding their core Shakti energy.
A new integrated look at spirituality that embraces all of life.


This is truly a revolutionary project; no one is doing anything like this!  No one is teaching this.  No one has looked at it in quite this way before....and this has the power to change the lives of people in the West for the better.  It has the potential to re-conceptualize the way people relate to their spirituality and core empowered self.

<h3>Hi, </h3>
<h3><b style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 24px; letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">My name is Fruzsina and I welcome you to my Indiegogo campaign! </b></h3>
<p>I
have been writing in my whole life but several years ago I had a vision
of writing a whole series of conscious and spiritual books, called <b><i>Your Earth,
Your World</i></b>, that would help children (and grown ups) to find, notice and
appreciate the beauty of our Planet, each other, the nature and all beings of
Earth and beyond. </p>
<p>About
10 moths ago I wrote more than a dozen poem-stories that are undergoing major
illustration by an amazing and talented artist, <b>Beatrix-Renata Bihari </b>who is deliberately working on bringing these books alive. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b><i>THE MISSION </i></b><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/93384/files/20130924105824-3_2_2.jpg?1380045504"" src="""" style=""""/></p></span></h3>
<p>Through
these series of stories my mission is<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> to help children AND grown ups increase
their conscious connection to Mother Earth and the nature, to build intention
to take care of their environment and each other through the power of love and
guide them how to walk through life with awareness of peace and love for all.</span></p>
<p>Reading
these books to children or adults this beautiful collection of poetries is to
help evoke and expand the divine unconditional love in everyone while promoting
spiritual growth and self-awareness. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>""BE THE CHANGE YOU WANT TO SEE IN THIS WORLD""...</b></p>
<p>... as Gandhi said for it'd be truly transformational for people to fully appreciate this beautiful Planet, accept each other for who they are and be grateful for all the things in life. Eliminate judgments, cynicism, negative opinions and thoughts and shine Light onto what is truly important in our World so that we all may live in peace and harmony on this beautiful Earth.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><b><i>ABOUT THE BOOK SERIES</i> </b></h3>
<p>You’ll
find fun activities and games at the end of each book that is related to the

<p> <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Along

<p> </p>
<h3>Who I am and why I need you:</h3>
<p>I am a writer, speaker and trainer for more than 12 years. Right now I am located near Frankfurt/Germany, and I am about to build up a home and office in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>In October I will fly to LA together with sheep WILMA, dolphin SILBERFLOSSE, shark HARKO, MARIE, LISA and LUCY - all main characters of my books - and present them and their stories to my business contacts. This is the point where you come in!</p>
<p>Because, if this trip is successful, and helps me to let my network grow by having as many meetings as possible with potential partners from the publishing business and the movie business, then this is going to be the kick-off for readings, workshops, creative projects of all kinds, and for bringing my books successfully to LA and to the US!</p>
<p>My professional partners and my clients know that I would give my last shirt (as we would say here in Germany) to support projects - my own and yours - and to make sure that a great success is always a WIN-WIN-WIN situation. </p>
<p>I love this platform, because together we can bring our best work out into the world - and get something great back in exchange! </p>
<p>I need you to reach a goal only few people in Germany dare to dream of: to bring my creative work into the US and into the whole world. Please, support me and I will do my very best to help you bring out yours!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What I Need and What You Get:</h3>
<p>The money will be spent for the flight (1000 Euros), accommodation (1500 Euros), meals and meetings with potential partners. </p>
<p>I am looking forward to give you something great and exciting back:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>For $ 5: You get my setcard with your name on it!</strong></li>
<li><strong>For $ 150: You get an half-an-hour personal coaching with me!</strong></li>
<li><strong>For $ 300: You spend 1 hour live with me, and will get answers to all your questions on writing, creativity and your personal success!</strong></li>
<li><strong>For $ 2500: You can show your banner on my website for 6 months!</strong></li>
<li><strong>And for $4 000: You and your business are visible on my website for a whole year - 365 days!</strong></li>
</ul><p>I will fly to Los Angeles end of October for 10 days, independent of reaching the entire goal or not. Your money will be spent wisely and carefully, and it will nurture me wherever I go. Every coffee, every sandwich or soup will be enjoyed by me thinking of you and your wonderful support. Thank you!</p>

Pls note images submitted must contain <span style=""color: #3300ff;"">orbs and/or circles</span>.</span></span></span></span></h3>
<p> </p>
<h3><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms; font-size: large;""><span style=""color: #330066; font-family: trebuchet ms;"">Who’s doing what?</span></span></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms; font-size: large;""><span style=""font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;"">I'm Cindy O'Neil, the fourth daughter of six to my departed parents - at last they get some peace. My IndieGoGo quest is to publish a remarkable book that I began creating in the winter of 2001 in the midst of a long-term and life altering health change. </span></span></h3>
<h3>
<br/><span style=""font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;"">Having just been released from a month long stay in hospital and diagnosed with severe, systemic Rheumatoid Arthritis I was in a very transformed, painful and shockingly creative space. Confined to home by disability, healing became my full time job. This involved anything that would buoy my health and spirit. One such anything was doing word puzzles. </span>
</h3>
<h3>
<br/><span style=""font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;"">Many a day dissolved as I played with words. At some point ideas for puzzles began to spill over my mind. I was so engrossed in making these puzzles that I’d be up till all hours just picking themes, researching words, places etc. In the process my pain and fear evaporated, I was healing - my <em><span style=""color: #ff6600;"">Healing Circle Puzzles </span></em>project was born.</span>
</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><span style=""color: #330066; font-family: trebuchet ms; font-size: large;"">What's so unique about this book?</span></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;"">From my research this type of book hasn’t been done before. My <em><span style=""color: #ff6600;"">Healing Circle Puzzles</span></em> book combines original works of art with unusually crafted word search puzzles. Throughout the book full colour images by very talented undiscovered artists will accompany each word search. The artist bios/websites will also be featured. </span></h3>
<h3>
<br/><span style=""font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;"">I created the puzzles in a time when I was healing. But I didn’t want to make just any puzzles, the whole thing about healing and circles and the world and connection all came into the concept of my puzzle making, so I challenged myself and decided that they’d only be in circles. I didn’t use a special program; I designed the puzzles by hand then figured out how to make them on the computer.<br/></span>
</h3>
<h3><span style=""font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;"">All of the puzzles have themes of things that were helping me in my healing; positive thoughts, actions, music, books, therapies, healthy foods and more.  The contents of the book focus on connectedness, harmony, healing, unity.<br/></span></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms;""><span style=""font-size: large;""><span style=""color: #330066; font-family: trebuchet ms;"">Why I want to do this?</span></span></span></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;"">When I was creating these puzzles one of the forces that inspired me was the thought that someday they might be of help to someone else. Someone who was in hospital, people who were house bound due to health or injury. I hoped that one day my little project may bring other people release, joy or uplifting perspective. </span></h3>
<h3>
<br/><span style=""font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;"">Through my health change two energies - gratitude and acknowledgement - repeatedly manifested in ways that kept me fed, housed and safe. Since my health change I’ve been in deep financial debt, yet by way of gratitude and acknowledgement the Universe has provided. In honour of this I want to support and feature the talent of others in any way possible. Taking the risks and actions to publish my <em><span style=""color: #ff6600;"">Healing Circle Puzzles</span></em> book is one splendid way I can do so.</span>
</h3>
<h3><span style=""color: #330066; font-family: trebuchet ms; font-size: large;"">What We Need</span></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;"">I've previously self published two books, one in <a href=""http://www.iciclehands.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Icicle Hands and Icicle Knees website"">hard copy</a> and the other as an <a href=""http://www.smashwords.com/books/view/53643"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Before The Mist e-book"">e-book</a>. This is the first time that I’ve sought financial assistance for a book project - overdraft and credit are my usual sources of funding :). I can say with experience that publishing is costly in more than just monetary ways. I've already invested months developing the puzzles, the cover art and part of the book design. The next steps are putting the pieces into a complete product. </span></h3>
<h3>
<br/><span style=""font-family: georgia;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">I’m going to start with an e-book version, it won’t be as grand as the print version, but it will make the <em><span style=""color: #ff6600;"">Healing Circle Puzzles</span></em> book more accessible to people around the world. To launch and (pre)market the book a website is required. I’ve gotten a quote to have a website template designed. Once the template is complete I will input content to reduce financial costs. Advance marketing of the project will help to establish demand <span style=""font-family: georgia;"">which will determine first run print quantities. </span></span></span>
</h3>
<h3 align=""center"">
<br/><span style=""font-family: georgia;""><span style=""font-size: medium;""><span style=""font-family: georgia;"">Now for the really fun stuff; finding original art for the <em><span style=""color: #ff6600;"">Healing Circle Puzzles</span></em> book. <span style=""color: #339900;"">Let this be the official call to painters, photographers</span></span><span style=""color: #339900;""> and graphic artists’ world wide. I’ll be including 20 images in the book that are original works of art. If you are an undiscovered artist stay tuned…</span></span></span>

<h3><span style=""font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;"">Next is the formatting and basic layout of both the e-book and print editions of the <em><span style=""color: #ff6600;"">Healing Circle Puzzles</span></em>. I will be working with a printing house for this aspect of the project - it needs to be done correctly and efficiently so I’m leaving it to an expert. <br/></span></h3>
<h3>

</h3>
<h3>
<br/><span style=""font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;"">Here’s where you come in. $3860.00 will get the <em><span style=""color: #ff6600;"">Healing Circle Puzzles </span></em>project underway and that’s the financial goal for this campaign. Other than faith, organization and staying power, $3860 is what is needed to complete the puzzle. I’ll do the work but I need your support.</span>
</h3>
<h3><span style=""font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;"">Why so little an amount? My objective is to use funds from e-book and (pre)sales of the <em><span style=""color: #ff6600;"">Healing Circle Puzzles</span></em> book to pay for printing. That’s why a website and professional book formatting are essential. The printed edition will be made available when it can pay for itself.</span></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-family: georgia; font-size: medium;"">The <em><span style=""color: #ff6600;"">Healing Circle Puzzles</span></em> project started from a realm of gratitude and healing. In that spirit I’m inviting you to participate from the heart - please contribute an amount appropriate for you.</span></h3>

</div></div>","MAR 1st UPDATE: The time frame for art submissions is now over.
FEB 17th UPDATE: submission deadline is extended to February 29th. Pls note images submitted must contain orbs and/or circles.
 
Who’s doing what?
I'm Cindy O'Neil, the fourth daughter of six to my departed parents - at last they get some peace. My IndieGoGo quest is to publish a remarkable book that I began creating in the winter of 2001 in the midst of a long-term and life altering health change. 

Having just been released from a month long stay in hospital and diagnosed with severe, systemic Rheumatoid Arthritis I was in a very transformed, painful and shockingly creative space. Confined to home by disability, healing became my full time job. This involved anything that would buoy my health and spirit. One such anything was doing word puzzles. 


Many a day dissolved as I played with words. At some point ideas for puzzles began to spill over my mind. I was so engrossed in making these puzzles that I’d be up till all hours just picking themes, researching words, places etc. In the process my pain and fear evaporated, I was healing - my Healing Circle Puzzles project was born.

 
What's so unique about this book?
From my research this type of book hasn’t been done before. My Healing Circle Puzzles book combines original works of art with unusually crafted word search puzzles. Throughout the book full colour images by very talented undiscovered artists will accompany each word search. The artist bios/websites will also be featured. 

I created the puzzles in a time when I was healing. But I didn’t want to make just any puzzles, the whole thing about healing and circles and the world and connection all came into the concept of my puzzle making, so I challenged myself and decided that they’d only be in circles. I didn’t use a special program; I designed the puzzles by hand then figured out how to make them on the computer.

All of the puzzles have themes of things that were helping me in my healing; positive thoughts, actions, music, books, therapies, healthy foods and more.  The contents of the book focus on connectedness, harmony, healing, unity.
Why I want to do this?
When I was creating these puzzles one of the forces that inspired me was the thought that someday they might be of help to someone else. Someone who was in hospital, people who were house bound due to health or injury. I hoped that one day my little project may bring other people release, joy or uplifting perspective. 

Through my health change two energies - gratitude and acknowledgement - repeatedly manifested in ways that kept me fed, housed and safe. Since my health change I’ve been in deep financial debt, yet by way of gratitude and acknowledgement the Universe has provided. In honour of this I want to support and feature the talent of others in any way possible. Taking the risks and actions to publish my Healing Circle Puzzles book is one splendid way I can do so.

What We Need
I've previously self published two books, one in hard copy and the other as an e-book. This is the first time that I’ve sought financial assistance for a book project - overdraft and credit are my usual sources of funding :). I can say with experience that publishing is costly in more than just monetary ways. I've already invested months developing the puzzles, the cover art and part of the book design. The next steps are putting the pieces into a complete product. 

I’m going to start with an e-book version, it won’t be as grand as the print version, but it will make the Healing Circle Puzzles book more accessible to people around the world. To launch and (pre)market the book a website is required. I’ve gotten a quote to have a website template designed. Once the template is complete I will input content to reduce financial costs. Advance marketing of the project will help to establish demand which will determine first run print quantities. 


Now for the really fun stuff; finding original art for the Healing Circle Puzzles book. Let this be the official call to painters, photographers and graphic artists’ world wide. I’ll be including 20 images in the book that are original works of art. If you are an undiscovered artist stay tuned…

(Feb 5th update): The image submission guidelines are now posted.
An FAQs page has been created to answer questions artists have about submitting art.
 
Next is the formatting and basic layout of both the e-book and print editions of the Healing Circle Puzzles. I will be working with a printing house for this aspect of the project - it needs to be done correctly and efficiently so I’m leaving it to an expert. 

Project Development Costs:$2000 - payment to artists featured in book (20 artists in total, $100 per artist)$  880 - book website template$  380 - e-book formatting$  600 - basic book design/layout at printing house


Here’s where you come in. $3860.00 will get the Healing Circle Puzzles project underway and that’s the financial goal for this campaign. Other than faith, organization and staying power, $3860 is what is needed to complete the puzzle. I’ll do the work but I need your support.

Why so little an amount? My objective is to use funds from e-book and (pre)sales of the Healing Circle Puzzles book to pay for printing. That’s why a website and professional book formatting are essential. The printed edition will be made available when it can pay for itself.
The Healing Circle Puzzles project started from a realm of gratitude and healing. In that spirit I’m inviting you to participate from the heart - please contribute an amount appropriate for you.
If I had a dollar for every time I didn’t have a penny (that’s a lyric line from a song I’m writing) this project would be long completed. I can honestly say that it sucks to be broke. So what happens if I don’t reach the goal amount?  You’ll get some great perks and I’ll be doing house work for my future mother-in-law so that I can complete this project.

What You Get

On the topic of perks, please cast your eyes to the right of your screen. All the perks include my deep gratitude and acknowledgment. Please know that any financial contribution you make to this campaign is of extreme value to me. I know that many of you are in a tight spot and others are looking for ways that you can share your abundance. While the amount is important, ultimately the vital thing is that you’ve chosen to be part of the circle. The act of giving what you can because you want to help is the core of healing and the circle.

And with<br/>your help they won't be.</p>
<p>The Bear-Time Stories Project allows people all over the world to<br/>donate a bedtime story by reading it aloud and sending it to us.

<p><strong>Why Bedtime Stories?</strong></p>
<p>In our opinion a bedtime story is a highlight for every child.

But perhaps the biggest benefit comes from an<br/>even more basic truth: that when a child is read to, they feel loved.</p>
<p><strong>Where does my money go?</strong></p>
<p>Our aim is to provide as many children with stories as possible. Our<br/>project is a non-profit program, therefore every pledge will directly<br/>go into realizing this aim by buying bears with the inserted audio technology. Additionally covering up the cost of transport of our giveaways to various<br/>orphanages and children's rescues is required.  If we don't reach our aim, all the money that has been contributed will still go directly towards these goals.</p>
<p><strong>What is the purpose of the Bears?</strong></p>
<p>The bears are the medium to bring the digital recorded stories to the<br/>children. The children can snuggle up to it at bedtime listening to<br/>your story.</p>
<p><strong>Will I see the results?</strong></p>
<p>We will constantly update our news on this project. Our website will<br/>show how many people recorded stories, how many teddies are prepared<br/>and where everything went by uploading photos, texts or even press<br/>related attention.

<p><b>About
Suzahn</b></p>
<p></p><p>I write poems unprofessionally, with a passion. I like to write
with no boundaries between subjects - or, better yet, I like to write in the
liminal spaces between people (spaces that become relationships, actions, and
connections). My voice is a constantly developing power, as is yours. </p>
<p><br/>
In my other lives, I like to teach about anti-oppression, mutual aid, direct
action, education, and collectivism. Sometimes I do this as a “job,” though
mostly I do it because I like to and brings me closer to the people around me.
I also have spent much time dedicated to studying ancient Greek Tragedy, and
draw much inspiration from the power of those texts.</p>
So far, my poetry has appeared in online publications such as Otis
Nebula and Broad! magazine. To read my published and some self-published
poetry, you can go to my website at <a href=""http://youmightybee.tumblr.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">youmightybee.tumblr.com</a> and poke around there. Lately I've
been forgoing submitting to lit journals because I prefer working
more intimately on publishing projects, like with Christine and Lily. It feels
much more empowering to be able to work with fellow artists who have skills and
passions that are in different realms - all to create something beautiful
together.<a href=""http://youmightybee.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><p></p>

This
book’s design was inspired by the symbolic and intimate moment of putting on
jewelry. The eight stanza poem is strung together on eight pages in this
accordion style book. At its ends are the pieces to a gold clasp that also
function to hold the book together.
Variation
of drawing by Lily Rossebo to be printed behind the poem in accordion fold

About
Suzahn
I write poems unprofessionally, with a passion. I like to write
with no boundaries between subjects - or, better yet, I like to write in the
liminal spaces between people (spaces that become relationships, actions, and
connections). My voice is a constantly developing power, as is yours. 

In my other lives, I like to teach about anti-oppression, mutual aid, direct
action, education, and collectivism. Sometimes I do this as a “job,” though
mostly I do it because I like to and brings me closer to the people around me.
I also have spent much time dedicated to studying ancient Greek Tragedy, and
draw much inspiration from the power of those texts.
So far, my poetry has appeared in online publications such as Otis
Nebula and Broad! magazine. To read my published and some self-published
poetry, you can go to my website at youmightybee.tumblr.com and poke around there. Lately I've
been forgoing submitting to lit journals because I prefer working
more intimately on publishing projects, like with Christine and Lily. It feels
much more empowering to be able to work with fellow artists who have skills and
passions that are in different realms - all to create something beautiful
together.

a ticket to the convention, and access to cover all of it and interview some of

<p>I have done the math, checked the prices and I can get there

<p>So I am appealing to you, the readers who have said they

and live tweets during conference events.</p>
<p>If you can afford to donate over $75, I will personally

<p>This book is about different approaches to support individuals with food allergies. I wrote it because I want people to gain a better understanding about what it is like to live with food allergies and essentially, how to help those who are living with them. My book will publish in April, 2020. </p>
<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><i>When Food Can Kill You</i> — My book presents many different types of obstacles that people with food allergies face every day. It explores a variety of potential solutions and strategies for addressing these obstacles more effectively. It examines considerable factors influencing both positive and negative outlooks on individuals with food allergies, as well as specialty food items. It also educates those who are unaware about food allergies on how to deal with them in various situations. <br/><br/>My name is Gabrielle Zimmerman and I am the author of <i>When Food Can Kill You</i>. I wrote this book because I wanted to explore a variety of elements that make food allergies complex and often misunderstood. I realized that people are not always intentionally discriminatory towards those living with food allergies, but just don’t have a framework on how to deal with it in everyday situations.  <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will gain a better understanding about what it is like to live with food allergies and to discover new ways to support those around you who have them. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for spreading food allergy awareness. And then ultimately, I want you to see this book as a guide for knowing how to deal with food allergies on a daily basis. <br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the impact of evolving foodways on consumers' behaviors towards food allergies and specialty food items in the marketplace. You’ll learn about my own personal journey with celiac disease and food allergies. You’ll also be exposed to multiple ways in which food allergies are presented in various contexts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How food industry innovations and trends have impacted the food allergy community both positively and negatively. </strong></li>
<li><strong>What my life was like both before and after my diagnoses with celiac disease and food allergies.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Two unaccompanied teenagers trying to fly back to school were kicked off a connecting international flight in Seoul, South Korea for a nut allergy. Korean airlines refused to refrain from serving peanuts on the flight, which left the boys no other choice but to fly back to Atlanta where they started. </strong></li>
<li>
<strong>What started out as an innocent request for me to share a dessert with him, quickly escalated into his relentless insistence that my symptoms were all ""in my head.""</strong><strong>​</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you crave new insights about food allergies and want to engage in different strategies that can be both helpful to you or to someone with food allergies. If you’re looking for guidance on how to treat food allergies, then this is the book for you! For anyone passionate about nutrition or anything food-related, as well as working in this type of field, this book is certainly a great read for you too! <br/><br/><i>When Food Can Kill You</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to those living with, or without food allergies, offering guidance on how to manage them and exercise appropriate precautions for dealing with them. It provides unique input on the apparent increase of consumer acceptance towards specialized food items in the marketplace, while considering how this has both positively and negatively impacted the food allergy community. It also addresses different types of human behavior towards individuals with food allergies.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Book - When Food Can Kill You</h2>
<p>The book is written in 2 Parts…so far...<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction + additional chapters. The reader will learn about the fundamental drivers of change in the food industry, how this transformation has come to redefine our perspectives about food in general, and how this has ultimately shifted conventional thinking about food allergies and specialty food items in the marketplace. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>The claim that the Gluten-Free diet is “healthier” for you has been a two-sided coin for people with gluten allergies or intolerances, or for those diagnosed with celiac disease.</strong><strong>​</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Rising concerns over the safety of today’s foods leads to new consumer purchasing behaviors and demands. </strong><strong>​</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Part 2</strong> contains Chapters 1-9. The reader will learn about key differences between certain medical terms, what my life was like before and after my diagnosis with celiac disease and multiple food allergies, how food allergies play out in six different contexts, and useful tactics that can be implemented into various food allergy situations.  </p>

</div></div>","This book is about different approaches to support individuals with food allergies. I wrote it because I want people to gain a better understanding about what it is like to live with food allergies and essentially, how to help those who are living with them. My book will publish in April, 2020. 
Story of My Book
When Food Can Kill You — My book presents many different types of obstacles that people with food allergies face every day. It explores a variety of potential solutions and strategies for addressing these obstacles more effectively. It examines considerable factors influencing both positive and negative outlooks on individuals with food allergies, as well as specialty food items. It also educates those who are unaware about food allergies on how to deal with them in various situations. My name is Gabrielle Zimmerman and I am the author of When Food Can Kill You. I wrote this book because I wanted to explore a variety of elements that make food allergies complex and often misunderstood. I realized that people are not always intentionally discriminatory towards those living with food allergies, but just don’t have a framework on how to deal with it in everyday situations.  My hope is that, in reading this book, you will gain a better understanding about what it is like to live with food allergies and to discover new ways to support those around you who have them. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for spreading food allergy awareness. And then ultimately, I want you to see this book as a guide for knowing how to deal with food allergies on a daily basis. In this book, you'll learn about the impact of evolving foodways on consumers' behaviors towards food allergies and specialty food items in the marketplace. You’ll learn about my own personal journey with celiac disease and food allergies. You’ll also be exposed to multiple ways in which food allergies are presented in various contexts:

How food industry innovations and trends have impacted the food allergy community both positively and negatively. 
What my life was like both before and after my diagnoses with celiac disease and food allergies.
Two unaccompanied teenagers trying to fly back to school were kicked off a connecting international flight in Seoul, South Korea for a nut allergy. Korean airlines refused to refrain from serving peanuts on the flight, which left the boys no other choice but to fly back to Atlanta where they started. 

What started out as an innocent request for me to share a dessert with him, quickly escalated into his relentless insistence that my symptoms were all ""in my head.""​


You will love this book if you crave new insights about food allergies and want to engage in different strategies that can be both helpful to you or to someone with food allergies. If you’re looking for guidance on how to treat food allergies, then this is the book for you! For anyone passionate about nutrition or anything food-related, as well as working in this type of field, this book is certainly a great read for you too! When Food Can Kill You is a non-fiction book that speaks to those living with, or without food allergies, offering guidance on how to manage them and exercise appropriate precautions for dealing with them. It provides unique input on the apparent increase of consumer acceptance towards specialized food items in the marketplace, while considering how this has both positively and negatively impacted the food allergy community. It also addresses different types of human behavior towards individuals with food allergies.
 
The Book - When Food Can Kill You
The book is written in 2 Parts…so far...Part 1 contains the introduction + additional chapters. The reader will learn about the fundamental drivers of change in the food industry, how this transformation has come to redefine our perspectives about food in general, and how this has ultimately shifted conventional thinking about food allergies and specialty food items in the marketplace. 


The claim that the Gluten-Free diet is “healthier” for you has been a two-sided coin for people with gluten allergies or intolerances, or for those diagnosed with celiac disease.​


Rising concerns over the safety of today’s foods leads to new consumer purchasing behaviors and demands. ​


Part 2 contains Chapters 1-9. The reader will learn about key differences between certain medical terms, what my life was like before and after my diagnosis with celiac disease and multiple food allergies, how food allergies play out in six different contexts, and useful tactics that can be implemented into various food allergy situations.  

Understanding the difference between a food allergy and a food intolerance, or sensitivity
Understanding the difference between celiac disease and a gluten allergy
Going from an all-time high to an all-time low: singing “America The Beautiful” at the US Tennis Open and in the same month getting severely sick, leading to a diagnosis with celiac disease a year later and multiple food allergies four and a half years later. 
Ex-Noma Chef, Founder of the school lunch program,“Brigaid,” provides some input on certain complications that can arise when dealing with students who have special dietary needs
Learning about school lunch budgets and how that translates to providing special meal options for those with food allergies and/or intolerances, or those diagnosed with celiac disease.

<p>For the past several months I've been pouring my heart, soul, time and kid's college fund into creating three e-books, which is essentially a digital culmination of my life's work as teacher and tech trainer. After years of helping  students, non-profit organizations, and others with social media and technology, I've decided to up the ante and create three<strong>  e-books</strong> on various technology topics. I couldn't be more excited about the work I've created and I'm eager to share it with everyone. </p>
<p><strong>Here's a summary of the e-books:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Passing the Final Cut Pro X Certification Exam.</strong>  It's a multimedia enhanced eBook chock-full of informative content, including 1<strong>0 videos</strong> covering tips on how to pass this exam. I have proctored many tests and had great success with students passing the test.  I share my techniques and tips for becoming <a href=""http://training.apple.com/certification"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Apple Certified</a>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Choosing Yourself</strong>. I wrote a highly<a href=""http://www.chipdizard.com/chose"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> popular blog post</a> about being about to choose yourself. This is an important first step in accomplishing any task. In this e-book I share how I almost got fired and then laid off, and how I choosing myself made all the difference. I also share ways to start a blog and start building your own digital platform.  </li>
<li>
<strong>Pinterest for Guys. </strong>Why would guys want to use a site that is 80% full of women? That's right why?  It's because it can help you and your business grow.  And you can meet some pretty cool people in the process.</li>
<li>Above all, my hope is that my e-books  will be <strong>an invaluable learning tool</strong> for anyone who wants to learn how to pass certification test, change careers or find out how to use Pinterest for business.</li>
</ul><p><strong> Who else are my e-books for? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Students</strong> - make the most of your learning experiences in class and take and pass the Apple Certification Exams.</li>
<li>
<strong>Aspiring entrepreneurs &amp; career changers</strong> - To realize that choosing yourself is the important first step, but you must have a long term plan.</li>
<li>
<strong>Men</strong>- to help you understand Pinterest and how benefit from it.</li>
<li><strong>You!</strong></li>
</ul><div> </div>
<div>
<p>Now that I'm almost ready to unleash my work to the masses, I'm realizing that creating the book is just one of many steps. In order for people to actually know that my books exist, I need to invest in things no writer likes to think about — <strong>distribution, marketing, outreach</strong>, and other initiatives to get the word out in a way other than asking my kids to tell their friend's parents about ""daddys enhanced eBook series"" at recess. That's why I decided to launch this Kickstarter with a funding goal of $4,500 — to help cover my production costs, but more importantly, to give <em>my e-books </em>an even better chance for success. That's where you come in.</p>
<p>Your support will help ensure that my e-book will be released in a timely manner and at an affordable price for everyone. The estimated release date is for the first book is January 2013. And if all goes to plan. I'll be self-publishing my books with help from <a href=""http://www.vook.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vook</a>. It will be available in for Apple, Amazon, and Barnes &amp; Noble platforms. BUT if you back the project at the $25.00 level or above, you'll get a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DRM-free copy.</a> (A copy you can view on multiple devices with no limits.)</p>
<p>Your support will also go towards paying some of the talented students and colleagues I've hired (at a considerable discount) to help produce and creatively promote <em>my e-books</em> in a way that will give it the best possible chance for being read.</p>

<h3>Hi, I am Christopher Jack Williams, Lead Editor for Ellipsis.</h3>
<p>I want to thank you for stopping by this page and looking over our little gem of an Idea. What we are is a club dedicated to fostering a community of readers and writers in our area and one of the ways we want to acheive this is by having an open to the community literary journal, and that journal is Ellipsis.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>This will happen, but with your help we can make it the best:</h3>
<p>We are asking for $2,500 dollars so that we can publish the first two issues of Ellipsis in the summer of 2013 and 2014, this number is what we have decided will make it happen.</p>
<ul>
<li>Once we reach our goal the money is divided in half and goes towards the publishing of each volume, all of it for each volume is for publishing, none of it will be used to comission art or anything, this is 100% for the publishing costs.</li>
<li>Our perks are as follows:
<ul>
<li>$1: Our thanks and gratitude</li>
<li>$10: Free issue of Volume 1 the moment we have it.</li>
<li>$10: Free issue of Volume 2 the moment we have it.</li>
<li>$25: Free issues of both Volumes.</li>
<li>$50: Editor autographed copy of both Volumes.</li>
<li>$50: Your name goes on the Special Thanks page at the end of the book.</li>

<li>$200: <strong>Gold Sponsor Level</strong>, name or scanned image of a business card goes on the Gold Sponsor page and you get two free copies of both volumes.</li>
<li>$1,250: <em>Limited to 2</em><strong> Dedication Level</strong>, the very first page of Volume One if you are the first buyer or Volume Two if you are the second is yours. Dedicate the book to yourself, your cat, your business, or have your own poem published on the first page.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>If we do not reach our goal all money raised will go to getting Volume One published, if this happens any level that includes Volume Two will recieve an extra copy of Volume One instead.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>The difference your money will make:</strong></h3>
<p><strong><br/></strong>This journal will happen, this is something we are passionate about, our goal is to have this become a local living thing that happens long after we have left the school or the area.</p>
<p>But with your help we can make sure it has the best start possible. This is something that is designed to enrich the lives of writers and readers around us. We want local authors to be able to call Ellipsis home, where they feel safe, where they first got published, the first Journal to not send them a rejection.</p>
<p>This is the heart and soul of this project, the people of the community, and they have voices that need to be heard.</p>
<p>We are just going to be the microphone.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot help we understand, we wouldnt be asking for money if we had it ourselves already, we are broke college students who sometimes live off of ramen. But if you can not help financially you can still help get the word out, send other people here and see if they can help, share the link on Facebook, talk about us in local coffee shops to build street cred, everything helps. Just the fact you came to this page and read all the way to this point makes me love you just a little bit more than other people. Thank you for stopping by, and hopefully Ellipsis becomes the best Literary Journal it can be.</p>

<p>I'm writing a book about the enlightening realizations you get to when you examine everything for <strong>what it actually is. </strong></p>
<p>There's a whole lot more going on here than we realize. And I can't wait to share it with you.</p>
<p>If you step back and look at yourself, the world, and the universe through objective and rational thought, you'll be shocked at what you find.</p>
<p>This book analyzes what we already know through science, and discovers why we do what we do and why we're motivated to get better. We're all subconsciously doing a lot of similar things together, all the time, that we aren’t even aware of.</p>
<p>It also disects the truths about our reality, our conciousness, and our thoughts. And it offers incredible insights into what our future looks like, not too far from today.</p>
<p>It's all fascinating and <strong>it's all real. </strong></p>
<h2>
<strong>It's Going to be a Breeze t</strong><strong>o Read.</strong>

<p> </p></div>","Endless Awesome Mind-gasms and Realizations About Everything.
I'm writing a book about the enlightening realizations you get to when you examine everything for what it actually is. 
There's a whole lot more going on here than we realize. And I can't wait to share it with you.
If you step back and look at yourself, the world, and the universe through objective and rational thought, you'll be shocked at what you find.
This book analyzes what we already know through science, and discovers why we do what we do and why we're motivated to get better. We're all subconsciously doing a lot of similar things together, all the time, that we aren’t even aware of.
It also disects the truths about our reality, our conciousness, and our thoughts. And it offers incredible insights into what our future looks like, not too far from today.
It's all fascinating and it's all real. 

It's Going to be a Breeze to Read.

You can potentially walk away from this book with life-changing ideas that can empower you to become who you want to be, and to make of this life what you wish.
Or, it could just be a fascinating mind opener into the truths of our reality.
At the very least, you'll get a light, super-easy to read book, with topics that are incredibly fun to think about.

<p>Hi, I'm Maggie Rivers.  I'm an author.  I've been writing ""The Stiletto"" books with a friend of mine (C. Deanne Rowe) for over a year now and the books are doing great, thanks to all our fans.  They're three separate stories in one book and they each involve ""stilettos"" in some way.  At our book signings, we give away ""stiletto"" keychains as a token of our appreciation to those who buy our books. </p>
<p>One day, a friend sent me the picture of what I call ""The Stilettomobile"".  Well, I just had to have it to take to our book signings.  Can you imagine the excitement that would cause!  It'll bring people out to our signings and in today's book world, you need something to draw attention to your books; something to make you stand out from the crowd.  That something for us is ""The Stilettomobile"". </p>
<p>So, on Facebook, I asked who could build it for me and a lady I grew up with told me her son could.  He builds custom trucks and for him building ""The Stilettomobile"" would be a piece of cake.  Thus, my fund for the ""Help an Old Lady Buy a Shoe"" campaign started.  I made a sign to take to our book signings, put a picture of ""The Stilettomobile"" on it and started talking it up.  People love it and have been donating a few dollars as they could.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>
<p>We need approximately $30,000.  That all goes to the young man in Northport, Alabama who is ready to build it.  He needs to buy the bike that'll go underneath the shoe and also have the shoe itself cast from fiberglass.</p>
<p>Once it's done, ""The Stiletto Girls"" as we've become known, will take it on the road.  Yep, we plan to take it to all our book signings, and drive it in parades and other events.  We'll bring it to a town near you and you can have your picture made with it.  It'll be totally awesome!</p>
<p>We're planning a contest for those who donate.  For a certain number of lucky winners, we'll bring ""The Stilettomobile"" directly to your town, right to your front door and we'll take you for a spin in ""The Stilettomobile.""  We haven't figured out just how many trips we can do in a year.  We both have to make a living so we work full-time jobs in addition to our writing.</p>
</div>
<div>If we don't make our entire goal, the money still goes to the young man and he'll work on ""The Stilettomobile"" as he can and as we continue to raise funds and send it to him. If we make more than our goal, we'll use the rest for the upkeep of ""The Stilettomobile"" like gasoline, oil, etc.</div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>
<p>Now ""The Stilettomobile"" may not be the top campaign in the world right now but at least it'll bring a smile to a lot of faces when it shows up at your front door.  You know you want a chance to ride in it and wave at all your friends as you pass by.  What a hoot!</p>
</div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<div>
<p>While most of you will be able to donate something to help us out, some of you may not.  But, you can still help.  You can spread the word about ""The Stilettomobile"" and help us get those donations rolling in.</p>
<p>The more noise we can create about our campaign the better our chances are.  So have fun with it, talk it up, tell your neighbors they're never going to believe what you saw!  Spread the word!</p>

<p>Family, Co-workers, and Friends,</p>
<p>Anyone who knows me knows how much I love what I do every day. I am passionate about the work that I’ve done with survivors of domestic and sexual violence for the past 6 years. Through this passion I found a calling to the field of social work and a hunger for social activism. What began as a class assignment for me this last semester quickly turned into a sense of responsibility to help the Women of the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
<p><strong>Congo is the most dangerous place on the planet to be a woman or a girl.</strong></p>
<p> ** Since 1996, sexual violence in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has been used as a war tactic to torture and humiliate women and girls and destroy families. Hundreds of thousands of women and girls have been raped since the conflict began. In addition to the severe psychological impact, sexual violence leaves many survivors with genital lesions, traumatic fistulae, severed and broken limbs, unwanted pregnancies, and sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV. Survivors are regularly ostracized and abandoned by their families and communities. The women and children of the DRC pay the price for the consumer demand of these Conflict Minerals. **Please see the Conflict Minerals Video 101**</p>
<p>Now awakened to the atrocities that face the women of the DRC, I am committed to speaking out against this until the violence stops. I have been in touch with the Raise Hope for Congo Campaign, which works to create awareness on Conflict Minerals and has crafted a campaign specifically targeted to college students: The Conflict Free Campus Initiative. I plan to begin these efforts at Austin Community College in Austin, TX and I am asking that you help me in these efforts. <strong>On June 8<sup>th</sup>-10<sup>th</sup>, The Enough Project and Raise Hope for Congo Campaign will be hosting Act against Atrocities Advocacy Day in Washington, D.C. Here, I would have the opportunity to meet with Advocates from around the world for training, networking, and lobbying. I would have the opportunity to meet face-to-face with staff representatives or Members of Congress themselves when possible to inform them about atrocities unfolding in the world’s worst conflicts.</strong> I would also receive training, specifically from the Raise Hope for Congo Campaign Advocates to begin the Conflict Free Campus Initiative at Austin Community College. I would also volunteer to support a powerful exhibit and event called 'One Million Bones', a visual installation on the National Mall to commemorate past genocides and generate awareness and action on current conflicts in Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and other areas affected by mass atrocities.</p>
<p><strong>What I am asking for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>My goal is to raise at least $800, I am asking for any monetary donation you may be able to offer at this time.</li>
<li>$550 is specifically to cover travel and lodging expenses from June 8th to June 11th. I would cover my own meals, cab, and bus fare, etc.</li>
<li>Anything above $550 will go directly to Congo Campaign and The City of Joy in Bukavu, South Kivu, a revolutionary center, created by V-Day (Eve Enseler and Vagina Monologues) for healed women survivors, providing them with leadership development, educational and income-generating opportunities.</li>
<li>These are the women that inspired me to take action and if I don't reach my goal for the DC trip, all the money I raise will go The City of Joy to help them, so PLEASE consider giving even a small donation.</li>
<li>Your donation could have a direct impact in the life of a girl in the Democratic Republic of Congo and help her heal from violence perpetuated by consumer demand of these conflict minerals.</li>
</ul><p>The reason I am asking for help is because I am one person (a determined and passionate one for sure, but still one person.) This trip can connect me to others in this fight.</p>
<ul>
<li>The opportunity to train, network, and lobby with other activists on Capitol Hill can have a significant impact on getting the Conlfict Free Campus Initiative off the ground in Austin, TX. If ACC is able to declare itself the second Conlfict Free Campus in Texas (only TCU has done so) then the University of Texas and/or Texas State, St. Ed's, etc can follow, this makes a huge impact on consumer demand for conflict free electronics in the city of Austin.</li>
<li>This is the new Blood Diamond movement and we can impact the lives of people if we act and demand conflict free electronics.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help:</p>

<p><span>I have been a professional artist for 25 years. I wrote and illustrated<strong> ""Millicent and the Faraway Moon""</strong> a couple of years ago to help myself get over my ""not good enough"" feelings and encourage others toward the same. I have sold 700+ copies mostly at art fairs and festivals and at some schools and book signings.I work tirelessly to get my book out there and I am constantly seeking new opportunities and independent stores to carry my book. I have just gotten my 10th retailer and my hope is to eventually get retailers all over the country in small stores and large carrying ""Millicent"".</span></p>
<p><span><strong>""Millicent and the Faraway Moon""</strong> is a beautiful 40 page, full color, hardcover book for kids ages 3-9.The message of my story is one that resonates with children and adults alike.  It took a lot of money to print the book and I am finding that it takes even more money to market it to find a wider audience, something which my meager artistic earnings cannot continue to fund.</span></p>
<p><span>The goal of my campaign is to expand the reach of <strong>""Millicent and the Faraway Moon""</strong> by getting it into more schools, bookstores and libraries and making it available as an ereader book.</span></p>
<p><span>By expanding the reach of my book I also hope to attract the attention of a publisher.</span></p>
<p><span>Also, as I stated in my video, because of it's inspiring message, I would like to donate 75 books between Children's Hospitals in my area and School Libraries. </span></p>

</li>
<li>
<span>""Millicent and the Faraway Moon""-“This is a lovely book about self esteem and how other's negative comments can influence how we see ourselves. Millicent's friend, the 4th Blind Mouse, helps her to see past the negative comments and overcome her self doubt. It's a great story and the illustration is fantastic! 5 Stars!!” </span><span>~ Suzi McNicholas </span>
</li>
<li>
<span>""Millicent and the Faraway Moon""-“A very creative and enjoyable book with a positive message for children. My wife and I are looking forward to giving it as gifts to our friends children (and keeping one for ourselves!).”~ </span><span>By Eric Meyer </span>
</li>
<li>
<span>""Millicent and the Faraway Moon""-“I plan to read this to my grand daughters. This is a sweet life lesson for our young ones. Millicent, the cow, realizes her full potential and that she is ""fearfully and wonderfully"" made. Love the illustrations! I give it 6 stars!”~ </span><span>By Nina Watts </span>
</li>
<li>
<span>""Millicent and the Faraway Moon""-is definitely a book every parent should have for their child and for themselves. It is a wonderful way to teach children of all ages how to over come self doubts. </span><span>~ Margaret Cummings, Delaware School Teacher </span>

I wrote and illustrated ""Millicent and the Faraway Moon"" a couple of years ago to help myself get over my ""not good enough"" feelings and encourage others toward the same. I have sold 700+ copies mostly at art fairs and festivals and at some schools and book signings.I work tirelessly to get my book out there and I am constantly seeking new opportunities and independent stores to carry my book. I have just gotten my 10th retailer and my hope is to eventually get retailers all over the country in small stores and large carrying ""Millicent"".
""Millicent and the Faraway Moon"" is a beautiful 40 page, full color, hardcover book for kids ages 3-9.The message of my story is one that resonates with children and adults alike.  It took a lot of money to print the book and I am finding that it takes even more money to market it to find a wider audience, something which my meager artistic earnings cannot continue to fund.
The goal of my campaign is to expand the reach of ""Millicent and the Faraway Moon"" by getting it into more schools, bookstores and libraries and making it available as an ereader book.
By expanding the reach of my book I also hope to attract the attention of a publisher.
Also, as I stated in my video, because of it's inspiring message, I would like to donate 75 books between Children's Hospitals in my area and School Libraries. 
 
****Please go to the Gallery page to read excerpts from ""Millicent and the Faraway Moon""


Here's what  happy readers have to say about Millicent: 



""Millicent and the Faraway Moon""-“I love this unique children's book! It's beautiful message and wonderful illustrations are a treasure for the very young and old. Because of this I gave copies to all my grandchildren, nieces, and nephews.” ~Marilyn Desroches 


""Millicent and the Faraway Moon""-“This is a lovely book about self esteem and how other's negative comments can influence how we see ourselves. Millicent's friend, the 4th Blind Mouse, helps her to see past the negative comments and overcome her self doubt. It's a great story and the illustration is fantastic! 5 Stars!!” ~ Suzi McNicholas 


""Millicent and the Faraway Moon""-“A very creative and enjoyable book with a positive message for children. My wife and I are looking forward to giving it as gifts to our friends children (and keeping one for ourselves!).”~ By Eric Meyer 


""Millicent and the Faraway Moon""-“I plan to read this to my grand daughters. This is a sweet life lesson for our young ones. Millicent, the cow, realizes her full potential and that she is ""fearfully and wonderfully"" made. Love the illustrations! I give it 6 stars!”~ By Nina Watts 


""Millicent and the Faraway Moon""-is definitely a book every parent should have for their child and for themselves. It is a wonderful way to teach children of all ages how to over come self doubts. ~ Margaret Cummings, Delaware School Teacher

<p><em>About 2000 years ago Aristotle said: ""Happiness is the meaning and the purpose of life, the whole aim and end of human existence.""</em></p>
<p>I agree totally with him but have to add that <em>""In addition, we are all Programmed by the Creator for that very purpose, namely Happiness.""</em>  </p>
<p>Then you may counter with: <em>""If that is true, why is there so much unhappiness in the world?""</em></p>
<p>This book called Daily Happy Living, which is the culmination of my lifetime search for answers to happiness, answers that very question in great detail.  I also introduce my Joycentrix System - a set of five fundamental beliefs that are needed if we wish to live a happy life here and now (no matter what the circumstances).</p>
<p>My name is Gopi Menon and I am a 69 year old retiree whose profession used to be electrical engineering, but whose passion was and still is in finding ways to achieve true happiness, amidst all the confusion and frustration with the traditional methods taught for achieving happiness.</p>
<p>I am living with my wife of nearly 40 years and we are the proud parents of 3 married sons (who still keep in touch regularly from various parts of the world).  All our in-laws are wonderful people, plus I am blessed with 4 marvelous grandchildren.  So in the eyes of the world I am already successful and should be thinking of total retirement and being a full time babysitter to my grandchildren.</p>
<p>However, I feel that there is a larger purpose to my life and there is a deep personal yearning within me – to leave behind a legacy in the form of a great book which is truly useful for vast numbers of people who are mired in misery.</p>
<p>Therefore, because I believe so much in the message in this book, I want it to be published to the highest quality possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need and What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to achieve the highest quality in content I have already engaged a professional 'writing coach' from February 2012 at a cost of $315 per month which works out to about $3800 over the year.  Since I am a retiree living on a modest pension, I have had to charge this extra expense to my credit card.</p>
<p>My manuscript will be completed by early December 2012, after which I intend to get it Edited professionally and then Self-Published with a reputable publisher, namely Strategic Book Publishing and Rights Agency (SBPRA) or Trafford Publishing.  After that I intend to promote it using the AME (Author Marketing Expert) platform.</p>
<p>The total cost of these professional services work out to about $8800 and this is the amount I am looking to get funded.</p>
<p>I truly believe that I have been led to Indiegogo and to you the reader by Universal Synchronicity so that I can fulfill my lifetime goal.  (This universal synchronicity is a principle of happiness I describe in my book: 'What we focus on materializes through Precession which gets the Universe working on our behalf.')</p>

<p>Outsider Publications will be a small publishing house created by Christine Fasse and her team. Work is in progress on two new, exciting projects. Both involve photography, architecture and a new way of looking at how people inhabit spaces.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">1. Architecture, God and Men: The Marabout in Algeria</span></strong></h3>
<p>Our first project will be a five-volume series on Algerian architecture; from early, traditionnal buildings, to the post-colonial architectural boom, heavily influenced by Le Corbusier and Fernand Pouillon. Each book will feature rare old photographs and postcards of the relevant period, with a short bilingual text (French/English) by Dominique Fasse.</p>
<p>The working title for the first volume is <em>Architecture, God and Men: The Marabout in Algeria</em>.  Marabout are North African hermit, but the word also refers to shrines built beside their place of burial. From coast to desert, their haunting presence is a constant element of the Algerian landscape. Orientalists of all stripes have made it a cliché. In this book the author presents a new perspective, and a selection of images, painstakingly researched and collected over many years.</p>
<p>Dominique Fasse was born in Paris in 1948. He lived in postcolonial Algeria from 1969 to 1987, working in agriculture and travelling throughout the country. Passionate about the rich literature and history of his country’s former colony, he has amassed a diverse collection of documents and images, including ten thousand postcards from the colonial period, 1830-1962. He is the co-author of <em>Deserted Memory</em> in collaboration with his daughter, a book of poetry and old photographs portraying ‘a colonial Algeria that refuses historical segmentation.’</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">2. A witness to history: The Royal Army Medical College</span></strong></h3>
<p>Christine Fasse and Felix Friedman will collaborate to produce a photography book recording in contemporary terms the site today occupied by Chelsea College of Arts and Design in London. For almost the entire twentieth century this building was home to the Royal Army Medical College. The book will be a ‘portrait’ of the building, but also of those who served there; including some members of the Friends of Millbank. The group regularly gathers at Millbank; this project will seek, similarly, to unite people, heritage and history.</p>
<p>The team will produce a beautifully crafted book with full-colour photographs, in high quality print. Therefore it will not only constitute a record of history of the RAMC but also a beautiful object in its own right, which will do its subject justice.</p>
<p>Christine Fasse studied cultural anthropology at the Sorbonne University. For the last nine years she had resided in the UK, first in Oxford and now in London. Christine co-authored several books. She is fascinated by the building at Millbank and has researched its history and photographic archives. For the last three years she has been involved with the Friends of Millbank. She is fascinated by collisions of the past and present, epitomized by this project.</p>
<p class=""ecxmsonormal"">Felix Friedmann is a photographer. He did a photography degree in Vienna and has been based in London for the last nine years. His work is grounded in a strongly traditional, craft based field. Most of his images are taken on 35mm film and 4x5 inch film sheets, a slow, exacting, hands-on process. Exhibitions of Felix’s work have taken place in Europe for the last ten years and his photographs have been published in a wide range of art magazines.</p>

Carter
I am a man who was a boy who loved the old women in his life with heartfelt pride.  
My name is Carter Serrett and last year I wrote and self published an allegorical tale of seven unusual grandmothers trapped in Hell who are sharing their stories in order to find common links, mistakes and eventually a way to get the Hell out of Hell.
This is a story full of rich charchters that must be heard.  The release in December was well reviewed but did not go far in distribution.  
These Granny's deserve to be revised, re-edited and re-presented professionally.

This book was highlighted on iwant2behuman.com and was given a thumbs up by movie producer Michael Meltzer.

Please Help Dead Grannies Today.  You and you alone can help these multidimensional robust and complex grannies fix their wrongs, save the world and make it literally out of Hell.  

You will achieve this by helping them to spread their stories.

The ears of troubled souls need this allegorical tale told in a twisted, funny, sardonic and unique way that allows the reader to open share in the shame each woman feels and the stregth to put it in perspective while focusing on the solution.  Its a magic realism blend of humans, fairies, demons and walking dancing singing trees. We have no experience in the publishing world and find ourselves spinning wheels.  These steps..while costly will provide my team with the focus, direction and brainpower needed to propel this project further.

<p>Why does a child’s enthusiasm for their new history subject
at the start of the new school term fade away after a week? </p>
<p>Because school history textbooks are boring. FACT. They are
full of facts and figures, a sea of words and numbers peppered with the odd black
and white illustration of an etching or if you’re lucky the odd historical photo. In fact less students are taking history as a school subject when they grow older: <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-14666229"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-14666229</a></p>
<p>In school with fact memorising subjects like history, I
often found myself detached; unable to recall key events and dates in my exams.
Then my teachers tried something different the next term on our new subject the
Tudors. </p>
<p>Instead of having us just scribble down key date after key
date, we drew out the events of history like a comic strip. This creativity
felt ridiculous at the time, but I will never forget how important a visual aid
in this medium was. How did Henry VII increase his claim to the throne by
becoming richer? A cartoon of the king taking taxes from nobles and taking land
from rebels helped me picture this difficult fact.  This is where the inspiration for Simple
History comes from.</p>
<p>Simple History aims to ease the young pupil into their
favourite history subjects as an introductory piece. Key facts are easy to
remember through full, vivid colour illustrations. Every key event in the
timeline of a historical subject is portrayed as a cartoon making learning fun
and inspirational. </p>

<p><b>Six books have been authored and illustrated by myself already</b>, over the course of

On top of this, ‘Simple History: A simple guide to World War I - CENTENARY

at the moment due to the infancy of the project, Simple History is a hidden
gem.</p>
<p><b>*Your donation will go towards marketing, building trailers, printing
sample copies to give to schools and your indiegogo rewards! :)</b></p>

<p><br/></p>
</div></div>","Here's the problem:



 
Why does a child’s enthusiasm for their new history subject
at the start of the new school term fade away after a week? 
Because school history textbooks are boring. FACT. They are
full of facts and figures, a sea of words and numbers peppered with the odd black
and white illustration of an etching or if you’re lucky the odd historical photo. In fact less students are taking history as a school subject when they grow older: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-14666229
In school with fact memorising subjects like history, I
often found myself detached; unable to recall key events and dates in my exams.
Then my teachers tried something different the next term on our new subject the
Tudors. 
Instead of having us just scribble down key date after key
date, we drew out the events of history like a comic strip. This creativity
felt ridiculous at the time, but I will never forget how important a visual aid
in this medium was. How did Henry VII increase his claim to the throne by
becoming richer? A cartoon of the king taking taxes from nobles and taking land
from rebels helped me picture this difficult fact.  This is where the inspiration for Simple
History comes from.
Simple History aims to ease the young pupil into their
favourite history subjects as an introductory piece. Key facts are easy to
remember through full, vivid colour illustrations. Every key event in the
timeline of a historical subject is portrayed as a cartoon making learning fun
and inspirational. 


   What We Need & What You Get
 
Six books have been authored and illustrated by myself already, over the course of
this year. Your contribution goes towards marketing the books and spreading the
word. Early interest has been good and a few sets have been dispatched to classes.
On top of this, ‘Simple History: A simple guide to World War I - CENTENARY
EDITION’ has reached the top 5 free (on free kindle week) ranking on amazon. However
at the moment due to the infancy of the project, Simple History is a hidden
gem.
*Your donation will go towards marketing, building trailers, printing
sample copies to give to schools and your indiegogo rewards! :)
1) Marketing is required to get these books off the ground.  I will use your donation to promote the books through trailers, a press release and to build up the website (www.simplehistory.co.uk) and social media platforms. 
2) As you can see here: http://www.amazon.com/Daniel-Turner/e/B00H5TYLAE/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_1
I have self-published the books under the createspace platform. Your
contribution would go towards printing copies in bulk. This would mean that
costs would go down and we can get copies into classrooms. 


The rewards no matter how much you contribute are great, for you know that you starting a revolution to get children interested in history again. 
For those that donate expect: ebooks of Simple history and signed print copies coming your way and your name credited in the next simple history!

The potential of this series is huge. Here are some of the themes and characters from history I want to explore:

<h3>Who am I and what's the campaign about?<br/>
</h3>My name is Edward Dougherty, a poet and community college teacher living
 in upstate New York. I have the great fortune to have my third 
collection of poems accepted by Plain View Press, a small  publisher 
with a big vision. Here's a line from Plain View's About Us page:  <em>""Despite evidence that relentless violence has taken root worldwide,
 there is hope and there are artists to show the human face of it.""</em> <br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Why support Plain View Press?<br/>
</h3> <p> </p>
<p>Plain View, which published my book, <i>Part Darkness, Part Breath, </i>nearly had
to close when its founder, Susan Bright, passed away. Her vision and passion held it together for nearly 30 years. She was editor, book designer, publisher, promoter, and chief bottle washer. When
she was gone, things looked bleak.</p>
<p> Pam Knight has done nearly miraculous work to re-organize the press. But we can help. Not only will this campaign bring my book into the world, it will assist Pam to keep a small press viable. If you give more than the goal I set, I'll just order more books and keep the community growing!<br/></p>

<h3>About <i>Everyday Objects</i>
</h3>
<p>This s my most personal collection to date. It’s a kind of spiritual
autobiography, made up of many strands, all of which I think readers can relate to. <br/></p>
<p>While many of the poems are from my experience, I don't think the book is really about me. It's about the kinds of transitions that help each of us become an authentic person, which is what I'm still trying to do. <br/></p>
<p>One thread recalls formative moments, like having my mom read <i>Stuart
Little </i>to me and my younger sister (check out <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3p5_5v0eSqU"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">YouTube</a>) or getting the nerve to tell my dad I
wanted to quit playing pee-wee football. Others honor moving out of
the family home, my dad’s cancer, finding the love of my life, and her breast
cancer treatment, and our enduring love to this day. <br/></p>
<p>There's also  a 
number of “everyday shames,” those
small experiences that teach us our limits, and a series of “The 
Art of Attention” poems about crafting artwork, which may be a similar 
discipline to how we shape
our lives, families, and friendships. 
</p>
<p>Finally, the title strand of poems deal with everyday objects, like the
bath tub, clothes pins, the electric cord, and the single shoe that once had been the
display models. By playfully imagining the “inner life”
of these objects, these poems also reflect common human struggles. </p>
<p>All this is shadowed by the social context of war—WWII for my parents and
in-laws, Vietnam, 9/11 and the subsequent War on Terror for the rest of us.  

<i>How can we avoid being “mere
tools, objects / in another’s hand”</i> so that even amid dehumanizing forces
we can be true? I ask this of and for myself, but I hope
it resonates for readers, too. <br/></p>

<h3>Can you lend a hand?</h3>
<p>There is a beautiful teenage girl in Washington state who was in an auto accident in 2012 that left her scarred, both physically and emotionally.</p>
<p>She is still recovering a year later, and is making great strides. Her goal was to enter a pageant, which she did recently. She won at the state level as part of the International Girl Pageant, and is now eligible for the national pageant in Dallas in late July.</p>
<p>But she can't afford the airfare, clothing, etc. She has been holding yard sales and car washes trying to get funding, but is still quite a bit short.</p>
<p>I am an author of children's books, and would like to help her by donating the profits of my latest book to Felisa. My book, ""The Shadows at Sundown"" tells the story of children as they watch a favorite uncle's long slide into dementia. It is a educational and entertaining story; it's a good read, and your purchase will go to a great cause.</p>
<p>Felisa is a wonderful speaker. We are in the same brain injury support group, and she inspires me every time with her positive outlook. Nothing will stand in her way of success -- except a lack of funding.</p>

<h2><strong>Hello!</strong></h2>
<p>My name is Liam and I am a student and blogger from here in Melbourne. Those of you who know me know that I take a close interest in issues of politics and human rights. One issue in particular though has always held my attention: the Palestinian struggle for independence and human rights.</p>
<p>In June last year I visited the West Bank for the first time as part of the Holy Land Trust’s Palestine Summer Encounter program, a program that aims to educate university students about the ongoing conflict in the Holy Land. I stayed in Beit Sahour with a Christian Palestinian family who were generous enough to take me in and share their home with me.  My host father William is a blacksmith and is known around his local church as Abu Shaarib because of his brilliant moustache and my host mother Rula is studying to be a counsellor and teach theology at a local bible college. Their love and dedication inspires me every day. Their two sons Matthew and Michelle are two loveable troublemakers who I’ve fallen in love with as well.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 150px;""><strong>The Occupation and my mission!</strong></p>
<p>Although I was familiar with the politics of the region before my visit I was completely unprepared for the harsh reality of the occupation that confronted me. I was confronted with civilians being shoved around by soldiers in the street, tear gas being fired at children and houses being demolished in front of the family who were only a few minutes beforehand forced out of them.</p>
<p>As a human rights activist I had an obligation before I visited Palestine to do what I could to inform others here in Australia about what is going on. However, after having visited the land and made life-long friends in the area I now feel that I have both a moral commitment as well to do all I can to alert Australians to the struggle for Palestinian rights.</p>
<p>Driven by this obligation I am returning once again to Beit Sahour to learn more and volunteer with the Palestine News Network, a news outlet that has recently been established and is currently developing an English language department to help broadcast news from Palestine to audiences in America and other countries including Australia. I will be working there for two months helping to research and write articles as well as translate articles for English publication.</p>
<p>Having been fortunate enough to be offered such a role at the PNN I am currently seeking sponsorship to cover my trip and the associated flight and touring costs.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 150px;""><strong>So this is where you guys come in!</strong></p>
<p>I'm asking for like-minded people to help me on my mission. So if you're interested in human rights and quality journalism then why not pitch in a few dollars to help me out?</p>
<p>I would be delighted to, upon my return, deliver a report and presentation of what I have learned and achieved during the trip; and how these lessons will inform my work and mission here in Australia.</p>
<p>I have included a link to my blog below where I write about Palestine and the popular resistance movement.</p>

<p><em>Nine Lilies </em>is an anthology of short stories and poems that are varied in their content but similar in their theme.

<p>You will also meet Som Touben, a reflective piece based on the real story of a man who was treated as a comatose patient for over 20 years until doctors found out that he was actually conscience during his entire time during treatment. This is a story from his perspective of what it is like to see everything from the inside out, when no one knows your listening.</p>
<p>Finally, you will meet me, a 20 year old patient in Mount Sinai Hospital under the influence of heavy medication after a car accident as I walk you through the ins and outs of being treated for 3rd degree burns, and how to art of poetry, the love of family and friends, and a strong faith in something like god helped me beat surgery.</p>
<p>This, including short poems about a grandfather with Alzheimer's, a trip to the natural history museum, and more, collectively describes the psychological devices we all use in order to get through hard times and make sense of the tragedy that befalls us from seemingly no where. It is about love, loss, and pain. It is also about how I found myself through poetry and writing, and how sometimes, using these tools to connect with people in our lives is the only way to heal. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>About the Author: </em></p>
<p>Emily Jelica is a 21 year old writer living and breathing in New York City. Originally raised in New Jersey by her mother, a Serbian immigrant, and her father, hailing from Massachusetts, she spent her childhood years with a loving and supportive family that included her older brother Zachary.</p>
<p>Emily's writing began at the age of 9. Inspired by a traumatic family event, she began writing poetry fervently and has not stopped. Since that age, Emily has been published in an anthology entitled ""Sunflowers"" by Eber and Wein, and has competed in the nationally-ranked Barnard Poetry Slam team as one of it's five members. Collaborating with such artists as the NYU slam team, Brian Omni Dillon, and Carvens Lissant, Emily flourished as a poet while on her slam team and continues to grow from the lessons they taught her.</p>
<p>Currently, Emily is a student at Barnard College studying English Language and Literature with a passion for spoken word, poetry, and fiction writing. In her spare time, she likes to create short movies, go for runs along the Hudson River, and eat barbecue foods. Her plans for after college include graduate school for Social Work and getting this book published.</p>
<p>Emily's literary idols are Saul Williams, and her 11th grade English teacher Mrs. Burgoyne, who continue to inspire her to keep putting pen to page, no matter how hard you must push to be a true ""word warrior"".</p>

This, including short poems about a grandfather with Alzheimer's, a trip to the natural history museum, and more, collectively describes the psychological devices we all use in order to get through hard times and make sense of the tragedy that befalls us from seemingly no where. It is about love, loss, and pain. It is also about how I found myself through poetry and writing, and how sometimes, using these tools to connect with people in our lives is the only way to heal. 
 
About the Author: 
Emily Jelica is a 21 year old writer living and breathing in New York City. Originally raised in New Jersey by her mother, a Serbian immigrant, and her father, hailing from Massachusetts, she spent her childhood years with a loving and supportive family that included her older brother Zachary.
Emily's writing began at the age of 9. Inspired by a traumatic family event, she began writing poetry fervently and has not stopped. Since that age, Emily has been published in an anthology entitled ""Sunflowers"" by Eber and Wein, and has competed in the nationally-ranked Barnard Poetry Slam team as one of it's five members. Collaborating with such artists as the NYU slam team, Brian Omni Dillon, and Carvens Lissant, Emily flourished as a poet while on her slam team and continues to grow from the lessons they taught her.
Currently, Emily is a student at Barnard College studying English Language and Literature with a passion for spoken word, poetry, and fiction writing. In her spare time, she likes to create short movies, go for runs along the Hudson River, and eat barbecue foods. Her plans for after college include graduate school for Social Work and getting this book published.
Emily's literary idols are Saul Williams, and her 11th grade English teacher Mrs. Burgoyne, who continue to inspire her to keep putting pen to page, no matter how hard you must push to be a true ""word warrior"".",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi, everyone! My name is Lyra Shanti, and I am a novelist, poet, playwright, and songwriter. My sci-fi/fantasy series, Shiva XIV, is currently in its third installment, (The Riddle of the Gods,) and the fourth chapter, The River of Time, is due out in late 2017, with one additional book to follow. There are also Shiva XIV short stories that are being released this year.</p>
<p>You can read about Shiva XIV on Amazon:<br/><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/kindle/series/B01MXKKIBJ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.amazon.com/gp/kindle/series/B01MXKKIBJ</a></p>
<p>At the Supercon in Fort Lauderdale, one of the biggest conventions in the world, there are countless new readers and scifi/fantasy fans who would LOVE to start a new, unique series like Shiva XIV! Help me to connect with them and build my audience!</p>
<p>To get to the Con, I will need to purchase an ""Artist Alley"" table, which is listed on the Supercon site as $175 plus tax. I will also need at least 20 copies of all 3 books in the Shiva series, which will cost roughly $200. Final costs will include a couple of fancy banners, business cards, and random cool swag that will decorate the table, all to attract Con guests to learn more about the world of Shiva XIV!</p>
<p>Now, the perks! If you help me achieve my goal to get to the con, you'll get a special mention in the ""Acknowledgements"" section of the 4th book in the Shiva XIV series, as well as a special sneak peak of the book before anyone else! And if you pitch in $25 or more, you'll get a kindle copy of all 3 books for FREE or a signed paperback of book one!</p>
<p>Any amount helps, but so does sharing! If you can't give to the cause via money, you can help with sharing about this goal through Facebook, Twitter, or anywhere you think book lovers and awesome people are to be found!</p>
<p>Thank you so much! I wouldn't even be brave enough to be an indie author without your help, so thank you to my readers and to all my friends and family! &lt;3</p>

She wrote her first chapbook A Greater Whole in 2014, following which she decided to take the plunge and work at writing her first volume of poetry.  As life would have it, she had to put this on hold for over a year for medical reasons.  She began writing again in 2016 and plans to release her first volume of poetry in November with your help!  Her poetry is imbued with eclectic imagery, colour, soul, power and warmth. </p>

I've never earned much money from it and I've had other jobs along the way in my 44 years on this planet, but writing is what I've always done. It's in my blood, it's how I try to make sense of the world, and how I communicate. I write poetry, short and long fiction (two self published novels), and music journalism. I've been published by the Quietus, the Stool Pigeon, Shindig and other publications; I've had a short story published in an anthology alongside Irvine Welsh and Alex Garland; I've had praise for my writing from David Bowie and Henry Rollins. But as I said, I've never made much money from it. For the last two years or so I've been working on a book about the fertile psychedelic music community in East Texas in the 1960s, that produced bands like the 13th Floor Elevators, the Moving Sidewalks (later ZZ Top), Fever Tree, Bubble Puppy, the Golden Dawn and the Red Crayola. I've interviewed many of the surviving players, dug deep in my research and offered my critical opinion on the important LPs they produced.

He's awesome, truly.</p>

Alongside Will, he was the assistant Editor of Latitude Lookout and now heads Latitude Radio, and does a bloody good job at it too! He also heads <em>I'm With Geek's</em> Creative License section.</p>
<p>Alex Doust is our business and development manager. He's helped the magazine expand so much since joining the team and we honestly couldn't have got this far without him.

<p>Geeks are everywhere! The truth is that there isn’t a way to really define a geek, a geeky interest maybe but not an overall geek. Nowadays, if you just have an interest in something, you can be considered geeky and it’s not a bad thing. Being a Geek is something to be proud of, but you don’t have to be a geek to enjoy our content! If you have interests in any subjects such as Movies, Music, Television, Comics, Books, Technology, Creative writing, Digital image production, we’re bound to have something for you.</p>

<p>Being a magazine, I suppose the first goal is simple. We want keep providing Geeks and everyone who is interested with reviews, features and opinion pieces on the media that they love. Whether it’s film and TV or Comics and collectables, I’m With Geek wants to be at the centre of it. We want to be the primary source of entertainment for all the geeky individuals out there, because you are awesome and you deserve it.</p>
<p>Our second goal is a more personal one and was decided on by the company founders when the idea for <em>I’m With Geek</em> was originally conceived.</p>

<p>At <em>I’m with Geek</em> we believe in taking chances on talented writers with little or no experience. We believe that so long as your passion for the subject is there you can provide high quality content. We also have a team of dedicated Editors who prune articles and help our writers gain the valuable knowledge and experience they need to exceed in their career. In short, we think differently, and we’re never afraid to take a chance on someone and as we grow, we hope to do more and more to destroy that horrible loop! </p>

We want to grow, it is our intention to launch the E-Magazine for London MCM Comic-con and hopefully within the first year, a published print magazine showcasing the very best our writers have to offer, with plenty of exclusive content.

Some of them may appeal to certain people more than others, but hopefully you’ll find them equally, well, cool!

<p>Born Into Pain is the first novel of the Teach The Dream series.</p>
<p>Hi my name is John Seda. Many years ago I was approached by a friend who lives in Los Angeles. She was working with a drug rehab center, so she asked me if I could write a song about a strong theme. A song about crack babies and the reason for the song was to portray the serious problem with many young mother's that were smoking crack. Their goal was to send out a message through music. At first I was kind of shocked, because the first thing that came to my mind was (wow) that writing this song was going to be hard, but I was determined and I'm not one to walk away from a challenge. After many weeks of thinking about it, the idea finally hit me and it became clear to me how I would write the song.</p>
<p>So I came up with the idea to write a song about a baby in heaven talking to God and asking him a question. Why he would be born this way? So I called the song Born Into Pain. This song was the inspiration for the creation of a movie script. Me and my colleague Orlando Martinez who I met a little over a year decided to take on the quest to make a movie script from the song and notes that I had envision what the movie would be about.</p>

<p> </p></div>","This is a story of an unborn baby and his conversation with God and why he is to be born a crack baby who becomes a famous musician.
Born Into Pain is the first novel of the Teach The Dream series.
Hi my name is John Seda. Many years ago I was approached by a friend who lives in Los Angeles. She was working with a drug rehab center, so she asked me if I could write a song about a strong theme. A song about crack babies and the reason for the song was to portray the serious problem with many young mother's that were smoking crack. Their goal was to send out a message through music. At first I was kind of shocked, because the first thing that came to my mind was (wow) that writing this song was going to be hard, but I was determined and I'm not one to walk away from a challenge. After many weeks of thinking about it, the idea finally hit me and it became clear to me how I would write the song.
So I came up with the idea to write a song about a baby in heaven talking to God and asking him a question. Why he would be born this way? So I called the song Born Into Pain. This song was the inspiration for the creation of a movie script. Me and my colleague Orlando Martinez who I met a little over a year decided to take on the quest to make a movie script from the song and notes that I had envision what the movie would be about.
Orlando writing skill is one of the best I have seen, so between the both we completed the movie script. I am also working with Kimochi Neina from Guatemala who created the poster and book cover. So naturally the next step that we took was to turn the script into a novel and this way we can sell the book to raise money and eventually fund the movie.
The book process will take 6 months to edit from a movie script to a book with the assistance of Author Susanna Green and it will cost $5000 so we need backing in order to complete this project. We are here on IndieGoGo.com seeking backers to help us cover the cost to produce the novel. If go over our goal we will use the money for promotion of the book.
Best Regards,
John Seda

Here I am Waiting my turn For life without a choice To bear the burden that will be upon me To be born into pain
As I waited my turn I often wondered who I would be I can't imagine Playing the part to be Born into pain
Descending from Heaven I'll be born Into pain No choice in the given I am here to share my mother's pain I feel my mother's pain
No Choice! No Choice! No Choice! Born into pain No Choice! No Choice! No Choice! But to live
Temptation will be my eternal fate Like a vampire's eternal damnation I must overcome the pain To become stronger from my mother mistakes
Oh Mother you gave me no choice Mother here my voice Oh God It's hard enough as it is Why all the rock and dust.
Born into pain That's my fate Being born into pain That's my pain
Didn't imagine things would turn out this way As I waited my turn up here in heaven Upon me comes a burden and not a choice Looking through the eyes of trouble I await
There was something I must have liked about you See I choose my fate. Born to be given And to overcome of being born into pain
Here I am Waiting to be born Here I am Waiting to be born
Here I am Waiting to be born Here I am Waiting to be born
Born into pain Born into pain Born into pain Born into pain

</div></div>","Terroir Champagne: The Luxury of Sustainable, Organic and Biodynamic Cuvees is the first book exclusively dedicated to the Terroir wines of Champagne which are produced in an environmentally friendly way 


Hi, my name
is Caroline Henry. I am a wine writer specializing in Champagne. For the last 3
years I have been living in the region and I have become obsessed with Terroir
Champagne. It is the only Champagne I buy & drink at home and I love
sharing these rare wines with friends and family.
That is why
I am writing this book: Terroir Champagne : the luxury of sustainable, organic
and biodynamic cuvees
So what is
Terroir Champagne? 
Unlike
regular Champagne which aims for standardization, terroir Champagne is all
about individuality. These wines express the uniqueness of a place as perceived
by the winemaker. The winemaker or the producer is key, as it is he or she who
commits to an environmentally friendly way of farming. This is important
because to make terroir wine the soil in the vineyard needs to be alive, and this unfortunately is a bit of an anomaly in Champagne, which still is one of the most polluted wine regions in France.
A
second point is that the yields need to be reasonable as this will allow the
grower to pick the fruit when it is ripe rather than the minimum appellation
degree. Again this is not the norm in Champagne where appellation limits are generally considered as the absolute minimum.
Healthy ripe
grapes will make a more balanced and rounder base wine, without too much intervention and additives from the winemaker. The winemaker just provides the framework for the terroir to express itself. However, his personal preferences of vinification, blending, aging and dosage will also add to the uniqueness of the cuvee.
Different,
unique and individual – terroir champagne is also a real luxury- going back to
the original definition of the word. These wines are rare, hand crafted and
authentic and they are only about 0.02% of the total champagne production. They are a luxury because of their rarity and they are in demand. Fine wine importers, sommeliers and champagne geeks all over the world have started to realize the real value of these cuvees and have been actively pursuing them. 
Yet even if they are sought after they are often hard to find for a Champagne outsider. To date there is no reference guide dedicated just them so Champagne lovers need to weed through generic works in the hope to find out more about environmentally friendly producers. This is why I feel this book will add a lot of value.
What will the book cover?
I am to create a reference guide/travel guide covering environmentally actively engaged producers. 
In the first part of the book I will talk about the viticultural and wine making practices in Champagne before I delve into specific environmental practices as well as accreditation (Haute Valeur Environmental, Ecocert, Demeter, Biodivin).
In a second part I will talk about more generic terroir characteristics per sub region, before giving an overview of the winemakers who I believe make terroir wine in this sub region. I will tell the story of each producer and delve into the the why and when they decided to make terroir wines. I will also give an overview of the cuvees.
In a last section I will give hints and tips to make the most of your travel in the region and where you can discover our terroir products. I will include places to stay, places to eat (including regional specialties), as well as wine stores or wine bars where one can discover the Champagnes of the producers covered in this book.
Why Self Publish?
Real sustainability,
organic and biodynamic growing are still a bit of a taboo subject in the
Champagne region. Producers who chose to emphasize the life in their soil above their yields are often badly viewed by their neighbors as they are often presumed to be the cause of all disease.
On the other hand, now that the interest in Terroir Champagne is growing, a lot of people are starting to talk terroir, even if their way of working is not very environmental.  And most Houses who buy the majority of their grapes are reluctant to impose a real sustainability program out of fear to loose contracts to the competition.
Since I only want
to include producers who really care about the environment and don't want to be pushed into including brands who don’t, I need YOUR support to self publish. It is the
only way to remain neutral.
What will be covered by the money?
To realize
this project I will work with a professional photographer, editor and designer and these people all need to be paid. The remainder of the money will go towards the first print run and fullfilling the perks.The initial €10,000 is the bare minimum needed to realize publish the book; it does not include any pay for me.That is why I hope to raise more. More money will also allow me to work with a professional map creator and to publish the book in hard cover.
In order to raise the funds needed to publish this book I have put together an exciting range of perks. All of them will allow you to get your
own insider knowledge to the terroir wines of Champagne.
All donors will have their name included in the acknowledgements of the book.
Perks start from €15 for a T-shirt. Furthermore, any donation above €25 will include personalized copy of the book itself. Other perks include unique terroir tastings, tailor made Terroir Champagne trips, including a special tour guided by me. Depending on the time of the year, the trips may include a unique harvest or vins clairs tasting experience.
Risks and Challenges
The biggest risk for me is not raising enough money as this would mean that the book will not be published. The reason is that environmentally friendly terroir wine is only a very small segment of the the Champagne market, and most larger and best known players are not involved in this terroir movement...
My challenge is to raise the money and finish the book to be published by SEPTEMBER 2015, in time for next year's Holiday Season.

<p>I had a childhood friend
named Suzie. We spent a lot of time together along with her little pug dog  – a happy little fellow who always kept us
entertained. I must admit that I've forgotten his name now. He was Suzie's best
friend and companion. He played with her when she was lonely and picked her
spirits up when she was down. I enjoyed creating adventurous stories about the
little dog, some of which made her roll over with laughter. Suzie’s little dog
grew to a ripe old age, always by her side well into her 20s, giving her great
joy until the end. Although we moved across the country several times, Suzanne
and I always kept in touch. After we each got married, the contact grew lesser
and lesser, but she was never far from my thoughts. Several months ago, I learned
that Suzanne had passed away from cancer. She was only 55 years old, still too
young. I remembered the stories we used to create, and wanted to keep her
memory alive, possibly through my own series of stories of a little
rambunctious pug dog named Pugnacious.</p>
<p>Not so long ago, my son, now
grown up, left home to start his own journey. It was then that I decided to
write and publish my first book, ""Sweet Pea in the Pumpkin Patch."" That
revived the writing bug. The memories of Suzie and her pug gave me the
inspiration to develop the ""Pugnacious"" series. I know she would be
happy.</p>
<p>The first book, “A
Christmas Star for Pugnacious” finds Pug lost on Christmas Eve. He spends the
day trying to find his way home in time for Christmas. As the day turns to
evening, Pug starts to lose hope that he will see his beloved Andy again. Is
there a miracle in the works? Will he make it home in time for Christmas?</p>

But Pugnacious didn't hear. He was intent on
catching the squirrel. Even though Andy chased after him, the little dog was

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>Little Do You Know</i> is a novel about a college student named Hadley who is struggling to reconcile her uncertainties about her future, her mental health, and the relationships in her life. She had to learn to open up about her struggles in order to truly confront them.<br/><br/>My name is Iman Lavery and I am the author of <i>Little Do You Know</i>. I wrote this book because I have struggled with feeling the need to always seem put together, even when I’m not. I wanted to explore that need within myself and in the bigger context of young adulthood.<br/><br/>In this book, Hadley is a rising junior in college. Going into the summer after her sophomore year, she thinks she has it all figured out. She knows what she wants her career path to be, and even has an internship at her dream company. But over the summer, things start to fall apart and she realizes that she’s not as sure about things as she thought. The novel moves between two timelines: over the summer at her internship, and the following fall semester as she’s trying to pick up the pieces. She meets a boy over the summer, but her own insecurities and inability to confront her own problems threaten this budding relationship, as well as the other relationships in her life.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the universality of this struggle. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to facilitate the conversation about perfectionism and mental health in your own life.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you know what it’s like to hurt on the inside but hide it from the world, struggle to be open with the people closest to you, or are interested in navigating the confusing and difficult transition period of young adulthood.<br/><br/><i>Little Do You Know</i> speaks to young people and all those working to find a balance with perfectionism and mental health in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Little Do You Kno</i>w inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What does it mean to be honest with ourselves and others with things we’re struggling with?</li>
<li>How can we strengthen ourselves and our community by being open?</li>
<li>How do society-driven urges to always look perfect affect mental health and personal relationships?</li>
</ul>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing perfectionism, vulnerability, and mental health will change us all for the better.</p>

She is curious to explore careers outside of the corporate, 9-5 lifestyle after she graduates college. She took it upon herself to understand the world of innovation in order to make a name for herself and inspire others to do the same.<br/><br/>In her spare time, she likes to explore the city that she’s living in by going for long runs. She likes to cook—pesto pizza with mozzarella is her favorite—paint, draw, and listen to podcasts that she comes across on Spotify, like Daily Ted Talks and Michelle Obama’s podcast.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Tian at ttshi123@gmail.com and at @nait.shi on Instagram.<br/> </p><h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2><p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you.

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>Toffy’s Divide</i> is a story set in a pseudo-dystopian society in the year 2049. It focuses on a young, intelligent, corporate professional trying to manage his place in society while staying true to himself. Toffy is haunted by the utilization bar at work, because if it falls below 100 percent, he might join the drone of people rendered useless by automation.<br/><br/>My name is Nifemi Aluko and I am the author of Toffy’s Divide. I wrote this book because I needed a story for a musical project I was working on in 2016. This took me down a 5-year journey to tell a story about transforming our personal realities in a constantly-evolving technological world.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the inner strength we all have to forge our own paths. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to escape from conformity and meaningless routine as you learn alongside Toffy and the other characters about the importance of telling our own stories through courage, empathy, and embracing self-awareness. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Book - Toffy's Divide</h3>
<p>The utilization bar haunts Toffy, a high-rising engineer at the biggest technology corporation in the world. The pressure to reach and stay at 100% utilization never lets up. The space to do anything besides work is elusive. Finally Toffy goes against the norms of J Enterprise's conformist traditional order and breaks away from the shackles of continuous increase in productivity to write his own story. In this world, set in 2049, Toffy has to fight numerous forces but none more formidable than his experienced boss, James, owner of J Enterprise.<br/><br/>The external forces that Toffy is up against come in the form of non-stop distraction from the screens which are plastered all over J City - demanding the constant attention of its residents, his job that demands all his time, and colleagues who are constantly competing to raise their status in the clearly-defined socio-economic order that splits J City into High and Low Town. <br/><br/>Triggered by a life-changing event, Toffy goes on a quest to write his story after signing up for a covert project with his friend Musta. Scribbling in his notebook whenever he can get away from the invasive screens, he fights to tell his story and assert his individuality.<br/><br/>Motivated and guided by his loved uncle - Apo - who inspires him along his journey with the storyteller’s secrets, Toffy navigates the thin line between High and Low Town while managing his responsibilities at work and his relationship with Dejah, who’s a beloved star at the social enterprise arm of J Enterprise.<br/><br/>But Toffy has to work against the world he and his colleagues have built where only one form of narrative is supported, dissent is met with immediate social punishment, people are rendered useless by increased automation, history is constantly revised by those that hold the pen, and James and his councilmen are on a quest to shore up more power. <br/><br/>At the height of his professional success, Toffy can lose it all with every word he writes in his notebook and every sentence that makes him question the society he lives in. Every rhyme scheme and paragraph he adds takes him away from the tasks that are keeping him gainfully employed. He knows how easy it is to fall to the bottom of the order but even more intimidating is the climb back up. <br/><br/>Will Toffy survive his decisions? Will he get his story out?</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Who's Toffy's Divide For?</h3>
<p>This book is for people that love stories about self-discovery. It’s for professionals looking for motivation to follow their curiosity and act on their creative impulses. It’s for people that enjoy dystopian fiction and futuristic stories, and book lovers interested in what the world could possibly look like in the year 2049.<br/><br/><i>Toffy’s Divide</i> speaks to corporate professionals, explorers, and futurists who want to grapple with proper utilization of their time and doing meaningful work in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Toffy’s Divide</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the importance of developing self-awareness, staying true to one’s truly rich inner being, and finding your unique voice to tell your own story?</li>
<li>How do we deal with the struggle between maintaining the status quo for acceptance and having the courage to break away to find purpose?</li>
<li>What is the possible implication from our continuous advancements in technology and how it affects the everyday person in a world with growing inequality, capitalism, and consolidated power?</li>
</ul>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing purpose, self-growth, empathy, and curiosity will change us all for the better. </p>

By explaining the reasons why I chose to live inside my car, this book discusses the importance of policy making that help people find ways to find jobs, pay off student loans, as well as have the time, energy, and resources to visit the diverse geographies of the world ranging from cities, suburbs, and rural areas.</p><p><br/>My name is Franklin Sooho Lee and I am the author of From Harvard to Homeless. I wrote this book because I felt that my experiences prior to current as a vanliver resonated with the people who supported me throughout my journey — from start to finish. The book was a way to take the deep conversations I had throughout my journey and organize them into a comprehensive format.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how to explore alternative housing options that fulfill your goals. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to reflect on why you live the way you currently do. I want you to ask: “Where would I live if I had no worry in the world? What job opportunities could I pursue if I if I could move to any city/state in the near future? If I could cut my current rent price in half, where would I spend the extra money?”<br/><br/>You will love this book if you are:</p><ul>
<li><p>seeking alternative housing options to live in cities at a reasonable price. Vanlife is particularly attractive for geographical and financial mobility. It may be interesting to note that, with the current pandemic, vanlife business has been booming, which you can read more about in a recent New York Times article, ""The #Vanlife Business is Booming.""</p></li>
<li><p>a libertarians seeking to create a society where individuals are in the ideal environment to self-actualize and fulfill their deepest potential.</p></li>
<li><p>someone within the LGBQTI+ community who empathizes with the ongoing struggles of being part of a sexual minority. While our society has progressed immensely, the issue persists. The depiction that “Coming Out” is no longer an issue, I think, is a myth.</p></li>
</ul><p>From Harvard to Homeless speaks to people struggling to pay for rent, student loans, and other everyday financial obligations. The book also speaks to young adults who are finding it difficult to move forward with their lives due to challenges in finding a job, moving into a new city for opportunities, and/or struggling to pave a road of independence from your parents/guardians. This book is, ultimately, intended for those who want to grapple with how we might define freedom and liberty in the upcoming decade as we discuss how we might envision economic and geographical mobility.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that From Harvard to Homeless inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p><ul>
<li>How was I in the position to pursue vanlife? Did it come from a position of privilege or need?</li>
<li>How easily can people in our community pursue vanlife? Could people benefit from having vanlife as well as alternative housing options? If so, how could we make such options viable for our community?</li>
<li>Why have vanlife, tiny homes, and minimalism become popular in our society?</li>
</ul><p>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. Coming together and discussing homelessness and LBGQTI+ youth, policy related to affordable housing and zoning laws, and student loans as it relates to geographical and economic mobility will change us all for the better.<br/> </p><h2><strong>From Harvard to Homeless</strong></h2><p>THE BOOK IS DIVIDED INTO THREE [3] PARTS:<br/><br/>Part One [1] , which includes the Introduction as well as Chapters 1 and 2, is intended for those of you who are interested in understanding my back story and want the context of my decisions to pursue vanlife.<br/><br/>In the first chapter, I write about how homelessness can happen to anyone, whether it be a Harvard graduate or a steady breadwinner of a family (or both!). More importantly, I write about my experience coming out to my parents and getting disowned, as homelessness rates are higher especially among LGBQTI+ minors. In fact, LGBTQI+ minors are 120% more likely to be homeless; and, currently, 40% of homeless youth are actually LGBTQI+ minors.<br/><br/>In the second chapter, I discuss about the concept of privilege in choosing to pursue vanlife. Arguably, everyone has a choice in their life; however, not all choices suggest the same level of freedom. As a Harvard graduate who experienced homelessness — albeit one night -- I discuss how societal support for vanlife can raise the level of freedom for individuals for who need it much more than I did.<br/><br/>Part Two [2], which includes Chapters 3 and 4, is intended for those who wish to rethink alternative housing options and learn the gritty details involved in planning and pursuing vanlife.<br/><br/>In the third chapter, I cover the complications of defining the homeless and how the complication is an added barrier to pursuing vanlife. For one, based on how definition the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) defines someone who is homeless, it impacts who gets aid. However, the more important perspective is in regards to stigma as I question how myself and other individuals may see other homeless people.<br/><br/>In the fourth chapter, arguably the chapter that focuses on narrating my vanlife journey in more detail. The chapter works through a timeline in a diary format of my adventures. This chapter covers the various challenges in eventually pursuing vanlife, starting from getting a car loan, driving on the highway the first time, finding a place to park, and lots more!<br/><br/>Part Three [3], which includes Chapter 5 and 6, is intended for people who are visionaries interested in the bigger picture of my vanlife project.<br/><br/>In the fifth chapter, I cover safe parking lots in California as a way to show the most recent development of lots designed for people living inside their car out of need. In discussing the need and growing demand for such parking lots, I make the case that we should consider creating markets that supply such areas for cheap to replace rent.<br/><br/>In the sixth, and last, chapter, I reflect on my journey as a way to consider how my voice might amplify the needs of our community. I discuss how, unlike many vanlivers, I came with no fantasy nor expertise to fuel me. My project started from a combination or privilege and need. This concluding chapter accepts that I “truly stood on the shoulders of giants” and that I hope that I might be able to create a ladder for others to also see the great view from above!<br/> </p><h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

Every day, over 600 million people around the globe live on less than $2 a day. Humanity is closer than it has ever been before to bringing that number down to zero, but the efforts and changes required to accomplish that goal start with all of us educating ourselves.<br/><br/>My name is Danielle Hawa Tarigha and I am the author of Uplift and Empower. I wrote this book because I was curious about why there weren’t obvious answers and solutions to questions surrounding poverty alleviation despite the hundreds of years and billions of dollars spent trying to address this problem.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that the answers to poverty’s questions aren’t as simple as they seem on the surface and, more importantly, you will learn how and why to make a difference with the information and answers that are available.<br/><br/>I would like to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for eradicating extreme poverty in you. And then, ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you reduce the poverty in your area—shifting away from simply giving money and donating without research and shifting towards more long-term, meaningful efforts.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about topics such as the role of psychology in poverty alleviation and how the industrial revolution shaped modern social structures. I will also share stories about:</p><p> </p><ul>
<li>Why empowering women both in and outside of the household is a critical component to poverty alleviation</li>
<li>How China’s precision poverty alleviation efforts have had such unprecedented success in the 21st century</li>
<li>What job creation and training will look like in years to come and how new ideas about work will impact the extreme poor</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>You will love this book if you enjoy asking big questions, love subjects like history and economics, and are hopeful about the future of humanity.<br/><br/>Uplift and Empower is a non-fiction book that speaks to anyone who is curious about extreme poverty and poverty alleviation.</p><p> </p><h3>The Book - Uplift and Empower</h3><p> </p><p>The book is written in 4 Parts after the introduction and first chapter....<br/><br/>Part 1 covers the history of foreign aid along with the four industrial revolutions, an introduction to poverty theory, a discussion on comparative politics, and an overview of different types of giving. This section provides the history and context necessary for understanding how extreme poverty still persists today and helps answer questions like: Why can’t we just give low-income populations free money? How can I give in a sustainable way? And, what makes a country rich (or poor)?<br/><br/>Part 2 provides a deep dive into the psychology of poverty, (what I describe as “the poverty mindset”), explains why women’s empowerment needs to be a priority to move forward, discusses the impact of overpopulation and immigration, and includes two case studies on countries with quite different relationships to poverty: China and Liberia. In this section, expect to find answers to questions such as: How does living in poverty influence decision making? Why do women in low-income countries take jobs in dangerous conditions? And, what is causing the rate of global population growth to change?<br/><br/>Part 3 contains the building blocks for future solutions. The section offers a simplified approach to problem-solving as a framework for future solutions, addresses how the 21st-century job market can either help or hurt those living in extreme poverty, and attempts to find a middle ground between profit and poverty alleviation work.

Every day, over 600 million people around the globe live on less than $2 a day. Humanity is closer than it has ever been before to bringing that number down to zero, but the efforts and changes required to accomplish that goal start with all of us educating ourselves.My name is Danielle Hawa Tarigha and I am the author of Uplift and Empower. I wrote this book because I was curious about why there weren’t obvious answers and solutions to questions surrounding poverty alleviation despite the hundreds of years and billions of dollars spent trying to address this problem.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that the answers to poverty’s questions aren’t as simple as they seem on the surface and, more importantly, you will learn how and why to make a difference with the information and answers that are available.I would like to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for eradicating extreme poverty in you. And then, ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you reduce the poverty in your area—shifting away from simply giving money and donating without research and shifting towards more long-term, meaningful efforts.In this book, you'll learn about topics such as the role of psychology in poverty alleviation and how the industrial revolution shaped modern social structures. I will also share stories about: 
Why empowering women both in and outside of the household is a critical component to poverty alleviation
How China’s precision poverty alleviation efforts have had such unprecedented success in the 21st century
What job creation and training will look like in years to come and how new ideas about work will impact the extreme poor
 You will love this book if you enjoy asking big questions, love subjects like history and economics, and are hopeful about the future of humanity.Uplift and Empower is a non-fiction book that speaks to anyone who is curious about extreme poverty and poverty alleviation. The Book - Uplift and Empower The book is written in 4 Parts after the introduction and first chapter....Part 1 covers the history of foreign aid along with the four industrial revolutions, an introduction to poverty theory, a discussion on comparative politics, and an overview of different types of giving. This section provides the history and context necessary for understanding how extreme poverty still persists today and helps answer questions like: Why can’t we just give low-income populations free money? How can I give in a sustainable way? And, what makes a country rich (or poor)?Part 2 provides a deep dive into the psychology of poverty, (what I describe as “the poverty mindset”), explains why women’s empowerment needs to be a priority to move forward, discusses the impact of overpopulation and immigration, and includes two case studies on countries with quite different relationships to poverty: China and Liberia. In this section, expect to find answers to questions such as: How does living in poverty influence decision making? Why do women in low-income countries take jobs in dangerous conditions? And, what is causing the rate of global population growth to change?Part 3 contains the building blocks for future solutions. The section offers a simplified approach to problem-solving as a framework for future solutions, addresses how the 21st-century job market can either help or hurt those living in extreme poverty, and attempts to find a middle ground between profit and poverty alleviation work. This section discusses questions like: What would universal basic income look like in practice? Why have young people’s attitudes towards work changed? And, are higher-income populations obligated to help lower-income populations?Part 4 is the final chapter. In it, I address what poverty alleviation effort looks like from a day-to-day, individual-to-individual perspective.

<h2>Story of My Book </h2>
<p>Bringing Consciousness to Education is a book reimagining the education system by shifting outdated educational paradigms and integrating key consciousness components into classrooms.</p>
<p>---<br/>My name is Komal Shah and I am the author of Bringing Consciousness to Education. I wrote this book because, after being a public school teacher for five years, I became frustrated by the current educational system’s main focus and measure of success - good grades and college acceptance rates.<br/><br/>In my classroom, it became obvious to me that my students could also use space to cultivate their curiosity and playful spirit—their innate gifts. I realized that as an educator, I was not considering nor teaching my students holistically - meaning that I was not teaching them how to be truly successful in life.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the educational system has more to offer children than good grades and college acceptance rates. That is an old paradigm; an outdated view on what education can offer students. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for our children and the cultivation of consciousness. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you see a new vision for our educational system.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about problems in our current system and consciousness integration for a new future. You'll hear stories ranging from personal accounts of being a teacher and interacting with my students, all the way to stories from 70+ educators on their frustration with the educational system.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you you feel frustrated by the current educational system and aspire for educational reform, have a desire to teach students how to be truly successful in life, and want a better way to teach and develop your child.<br/><br/><i>Bringing Consciousness to Education</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to educational leaders, teachers, and parents who have a desire to educate the whole child in a new way.<br/> </p>
<h3><i>Bringing Consciousness to Education</i></h3>
<p>The book is written in 3 parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 1 - 3. These chapters focus on the current educational system and its outdated paradigms such as how the focus on academic achievement is leading to increased anxiety in children, and how the rat race has contributed to the increasing mental health crisis in our world.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains chapters 3 - 9. These chapters focus on the numerous consciousness components and their possible impact on students such as building space for authenticity, capacity for emotional awareness, and focusing on trauma-based instruction.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains chapters 10 - 12. These chapters focus on the steps on how to successfully integrate these consciousness components into our current system such as self-awareness and a shift in mindset.</p>

<p>In recent years, new technologies hustled the world of transportation. The search for customer satisfaction was first experienced great development late 2008/2010 to become a true competitive advantage. In this race to services, good Customer Service is critical and represents a fundamental competitive advantage because it is, in fact, more difficult to copy: a good Customer Service presupposes, beyond the intrinsic quality of products and services, perfect coordination and cooperation between the different services of the company. New technologies for their part, helped boost the sector, particularly through the development of social networks.<br/>The study of customer satisfaction originates in a simple question: how customers perceive the service of a company? From a service? In fact, customer-satisfaction survey beyond the strict framework of the measure of a satisfaction because it is primarily a market opportunity of listening, carrying important marketing implications: how to anticipate needs and customer expectations in order to change the company offer? How to identify and implement the ""more"" of the service, loyalty factor? How to better communicate its strengths to customers and prospects? In the airport world answer these questions challenge. Indeed, an airport environment is very anxiety provoking for its users on the one hand and airports themselves are waging a war of ""Hub"" to attract customers on one platform over another.<br/>So how to get to a rising channel information of its users while taking into account the aggressive environment? The experience of airlines and airport operator in terms of quality surveys for example, amounts to a stardust and much remains below what they could get such information from their users. The anxiety factor of airports has much .. lack of time, stress, anxiety, excitement ... to prevent the time today to conduct investigations peaceful, comprehensive and revealing expectations of these same passengers.<br/>The only place where it can start to listen to any investigation would be boarding room .. There close his plane one sees and knows to wear hand. But now, this is the moment chosen by the client to relax. Difficult in these conditions to conduct through investigations. Many experiments have been conducted by specialized external firms ... but it is to consider that these are issues of management and not passenger expectations. Counters with smiley (I like / I do not like) sometimes demanding an appreciation to a passenger and tries to steal the few seconds it will devote to press the button. Also needs to change attitude, both in the methods and manner of perceiving the client.<br/>Do not consider it as a client ""ROI"" but take into account as an alter ego, the company's partner. The correlation between satisfaction and customer-loyalty is an obvious and valid argument because, as we often hear, ""retain a customer is much cheaper than acquiring a new""<br/>Social media has become a preferred method for customers to interact with airports, especially when they are having a bad experience at services.<br/>Begening 2012, in the Top 25 of the most ""social"" airports, 20 were American, and only two located in Europe: Airport Schiphol Amesterdam (16th) and London Heathrow (20th). According to ACI Europe Annual Report in 2012*, only 77% of European airports were present on social networks, especially Facebook and Twitter. This could it be linked to the delay the European airports took to offer free wifi to their customers? The emphasis being placed on social media is highlighted in the latest Airport IT Trends Survey by SITA, which states that managing customer relations via social media is on the rise, with 30% of airports using social media to improve customer relations in 2014; a figure that is expected to increase by a further 40% by 2017 (FTE 2015 source). KOUIK Agency, already running a website dedicated to airport benchmark (<a href=""http://www.airportbenchmarking.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.airportbenchmarking.com</a>) will offer to all airports beginning of 2017 a mobile app “ Airport Advisor” in order to help airports to enhance their Passenger experience. This app will allow all passengers at any airport to grade services. From the car park to the boarding. One app, one unique place that will list all passengers comments. No more need, to be on Twitter, Facebook and other social media. A real time saving. And a greater efficiency. If your airport is interested by this project, if you want to be part of this new challenge Please contact us for more details at : contact@airport-advisor.com</p>
<p>We wil give you more details about the project</p>

<p>Airport Adivisor est une application mobile qui vise à recenser les avis des passagers qui utilisent les aérogares du monde entier et noter les services offerts par les plateformes. Mais également de permettre aux usagers, de faire des suggestions et propositions d’amélioration de services.</p>

</div></div>","In recent years, new technologies hustled the world of transportation. The search for customer satisfaction was first experienced great development late 2008/2010 to become a true competitive advantage. In this race to services, good Customer Service is critical and represents a fundamental competitive advantage because it is, in fact, more difficult to copy: a good Customer Service presupposes, beyond the intrinsic quality of products and services, perfect coordination and cooperation between the different services of the company. New technologies for their part, helped boost the sector, particularly through the development of social networks.The study of customer satisfaction originates in a simple question: how customers perceive the service of a company? From a service? In fact, customer-satisfaction survey beyond the strict framework of the measure of a satisfaction because it is primarily a market opportunity of listening, carrying important marketing implications: how to anticipate needs and customer expectations in order to change the company offer? How to identify and implement the ""more"" of the service, loyalty factor? How to better communicate its strengths to customers and prospects? In the airport world answer these questions challenge. Indeed, an airport environment is very anxiety provoking for its users on the one hand and airports themselves are waging a war of ""Hub"" to attract customers on one platform over another.So how to get to a rising channel information of its users while taking into account the aggressive environment? The experience of airlines and airport operator in terms of quality surveys for example, amounts to a stardust and much remains below what they could get such information from their users. The anxiety factor of airports has much .. lack of time, stress, anxiety, excitement ... to prevent the time today to conduct investigations peaceful, comprehensive and revealing expectations of these same passengers.The only place where it can start to listen to any investigation would be boarding room .. There close his plane one sees and knows to wear hand. But now, this is the moment chosen by the client to relax. Difficult in these conditions to conduct through investigations. Many experiments have been conducted by specialized external firms ... but it is to consider that these are issues of management and not passenger expectations. Counters with smiley (I like / I do not like) sometimes demanding an appreciation to a passenger and tries to steal the few seconds it will devote to press the button. Also needs to change attitude, both in the methods and manner of perceiving the client.Do not consider it as a client ""ROI"" but take into account as an alter ego, the company's partner. The correlation between satisfaction and customer-loyalty is an obvious and valid argument because, as we often hear, ""retain a customer is much cheaper than acquiring a new""Social media has become a preferred method for customers to interact with airports, especially when they are having a bad experience at services.Begening 2012, in the Top 25 of the most ""social"" airports, 20 were American, and only two located in Europe: Airport Schiphol Amesterdam (16th) and London Heathrow (20th). According to ACI Europe Annual Report in 2012*, only 77% of European airports were present on social networks, especially Facebook and Twitter. This could it be linked to the delay the European airports took to offer free wifi to their customers? The emphasis being placed on social media is highlighted in the latest Airport IT Trends Survey by SITA, which states that managing customer relations via social media is on the rise, with 30% of airports using social media to improve customer relations in 2014; a figure that is expected to increase by a further 40% by 2017 (FTE 2015 source). KOUIK Agency, already running a website dedicated to airport benchmark (www.airportbenchmarking.com) will offer to all airports beginning of 2017 a mobile app “ Airport Advisor” in order to help airports to enhance their Passenger experience. This app will allow all passengers at any airport to grade services. From the car park to the boarding. One app, one unique place that will list all passengers comments. No more need, to be on Twitter, Facebook and other social media. A real time saving. And a greater efficiency. If your airport is interested by this project, if you want to be part of this new challenge Please contact us for more details at : contact@airport-advisor.com
We wil give you more details about the project

<h3>Jayme Nimick</h3>
<p>For the last year I have been working on my first novel, currently titled ""Blessed Bea"", and writing a witty and radically honest blog account of the experience.  My blog can be found at <a href=""http://www.FormerSuburbanMom.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.FormerSuburbanMom.com</a>.</p>
<p>The next steps in the dream are to connect with a group of my contemporaries in the literary field, make a final review of my manuscript, and begin complete submissions to agents and publishers.</p>
<p>""Write"" is the perfect workshop to bring ""Blessed Bea"" the next step closer to being published.  The full details of the workshop can be found at <a href=""http://lifephotographed.com/doe-bay-writers-workshop/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://lifephotographed.com/doe-bay-writers-workshop/</a> </p>
<p>URGENT NOTE:  There is a 14 day time limit to this fundraiser as there are only 25 spots in the workshop. Registration opens JANUARY 25TH and they will go quickly!</p>
<p>I have tightened the proverbial belt as far as I can - cancelled cable TV, stopped coloring my hair, and sold off the unecessary portions of the life I share with my two young daughters in order to fund and continue working towards the dream of authorship.  Please help me to make ""Write"" a possibility.</p>
<h3>Writers Are Not Islands</h3>
<p>In perfect irony we spend a lot of time alone in front of our computers writing about the human experience.</p>
<p>For our works to find their greatest positive impact, writers need people.  </p>
<p>We need readers, of course.  We need to see our works helping people, making people laugh or cry, and ideally changing people and the world at large.</p>
<p>But firstly we need gifted literary people in workshops exactly like this one to connect and ideate with.  </p>
<p>The value of this workshop is: 1) The input of successful writers on my work and process.  2)  The experience of these writers as to ""how-to"" bring a work from a dream to a published reality.  And 3)  The potential relationships that are formed during weekends exactly like this, which will affect my career, my works, and my life from that point forward. </p>
<h3>What is Needed for What, And What You Will Get!</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>The all-inclusive workshop registration fee is $250.  This would be too little to utilize indie-go-go which has a minimum fundraising goal of $500.  Thankfully it also falls on a weekend where my ex-husband can't care for my children.  This means I will need to pay my neice $100 per night for 2 nights.  The remaining $50 will cover my transportation there and back.</p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal but raise a minimum of $250 I will register for the event and then work towards the remainder of the necessary funds on my own outside of indie-go-go.</p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal and am unable to register for the event I will use the money only for a similar workshop or writers group.</p>
<p>No funds will be used for personal uses not mentioned above.</p>
<p>WHAT YOU GET:</p>
<p><em><strong>***** $500 = WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER! ******</strong></em></p>
<p>Thank You!  I hereby dub you ""Uber Awesome Benefactor of Bea"".</p>
<p>You get all of ""Your Name in Lights"" PLUS:  </p>
<p>A $25 Amazon Gift Card</p>
<p>You'll be the 2nd phone call made after I sign my 1st publishing contract. </p>
<p><em><strong>***** $250 = YOUR NAME IN LIGHTS! *****</strong></em></p>
<p>Thank you!  You're amazing!  <br/><br/>You'll receive a personal phone call to discuss all of the happenings of the weekend, the book , the blog, or the topic of your choice on the day after my return.</p>
<p>You get a personal mention in the ""Acknowledgments"" portion of my first published novel.</p>
<p>You can choose 1 topic for me to address in ""Former Suburban Mom"" and have personal mention for said topic choice if you desire.</p>
<p>And last but not lease a signed copy of my first novel free within one week of it being publicly available!</p>
<p><em><strong>***** $25+ = THANKYOUTHANKYOUTHANKYOU! *****</strong></em></p>
<p>Thank you!  You will receive a signed copy of my first traditionally published novel free within one week of it becoming publicly available.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Every donation, whether it be $.25 or $250 is helpful in bringing ""Blessed Bea"" a step closer to being published.  Every donation will be received with humble gratitude that anyone would take a moment of their time and a dollar from their wallet to show belief in this work, and in me.</p>
<p>If you can not contribute a single cent there are other ways you can help!</p>
<p>1)  Share this campaign on your FaceBook page and ask your friends to help!  </p>
<p>2)  Read my blog - be it one post or all - and leave an honest comment as to how you FELT while reading it.  Even if it is ""meh"".  One of my favorite comments was from a reader who said I make her feel uncomfortable with my honesty, and that she likes it!  Better yet share it on your friends' walls (be sure to tag me so I know ;))</p>
<div>3)  Follow your own dream.  And tell me about it.  That is the best way you can contribute to my personal journey and aspirations.</div>
<p>Peace and Love,</p>

I have tightened the proverbial belt as far as I can - cancelled cable TV, stopped coloring my hair, and sold off the unecessary portions of the life I share with my two young daughters in order to fund and continue working towards the dream of authorship.  Please help me to make ""Write"" a possibility.
Writers Are Not Islands
In perfect irony we spend a lot of time alone in front of our computers writing about the human experience.
For our works to find their greatest positive impact, writers need people.  
We need readers, of course.  We need to see our works helping people, making people laugh or cry, and ideally changing people and the world at large.
But firstly we need gifted literary people in workshops exactly like this one to connect and ideate with.  
The value of this workshop is: 1) The input of successful writers on my work and process.  2)  The experience of these writers as to ""how-to"" bring a work from a dream to a published reality.  And 3)  The potential relationships that are formed during weekends exactly like this, which will affect my career, my works, and my life from that point forward. 
What is Needed for What, And What You Will Get!


The all-inclusive workshop registration fee is $250.  This would be too little to utilize indie-go-go which has a minimum fundraising goal of $500.  Thankfully it also falls on a weekend where my ex-husband can't care for my children.  This means I will need to pay my neice $100 per night for 2 nights.  The remaining $50 will cover my transportation there and back.
If I don't reach my goal but raise a minimum of $250 I will register for the event and then work towards the remainder of the necessary funds on my own outside of indie-go-go.
If I don't reach my goal and am unable to register for the event I will use the money only for a similar workshop or writers group.
No funds will be used for personal uses not mentioned above.
WHAT YOU GET:
***** $500 = WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER! ******
Thank You!  I hereby dub you ""Uber Awesome Benefactor of Bea"".
You get all of ""Your Name in Lights"" PLUS:  
A $25 Amazon Gift Card
You'll be the 2nd phone call made after I sign my 1st publishing contract. 
***** $250 = YOUR NAME IN LIGHTS! *****
Thank you!  You're amazing!  You'll receive a personal phone call to discuss all of the happenings of the weekend, the book , the blog, or the topic of your choice on the day after my return.
You get a personal mention in the ""Acknowledgments"" portion of my first published novel.
You can choose 1 topic for me to address in ""Former Suburban Mom"" and have personal mention for said topic choice if you desire.
And last but not lease a signed copy of my first novel free within one week of it being publicly available!
***** $25+ = THANKYOUTHANKYOUTHANKYOU! *****
Thank you!  You will receive a signed copy of my first traditionally published novel free within one week of it becoming publicly available.  


Other Ways You Can Help
Every donation, whether it be $.25 or $250 is helpful in bringing ""Blessed Bea"" a step closer to being published.  Every donation will be received with humble gratitude that anyone would take a moment of their time and a dollar from their wallet to show belief in this work, and in me.
If you can not contribute a single cent there are other ways you can help!
1)  Share this campaign on your FaceBook page and ask your friends to help!  
2)  Read my blog - be it one post or all - and leave an honest comment as to how you FELT while reading it.  Even if it is ""meh"".  One of my favorite comments was from a reader who said I make her feel uncomfortable with my honesty, and that she likes it!  Better yet share it on your friends' walls (be sure to tag me so I know ;))
3)  Follow your own dream.  And tell me about it.  That is the best way you can contribute to my personal journey and aspirations.
Peace and Love,

Despite following the prevailing wisdom about “how to be successful,” I found myself completely burnt out at the age of 31, with a life that looked great on paper, but in reality was a complete sham.<br/><br/>Over the past eight years, I’ve been on a journey to remain comfortable in my skin, regardless of the setting. This book explains the mental shifts and mindfulness practices that have helped others and myself navigate the messier parts of the workplace — and life — when conventional wisdom falls short.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover your own internal compass and learn how to follow your intuition — even when it means breaking from the pack. I’ll share various mindfulness practices and techniques have helped others and myself turn down the volume knob on the other voices in today’s hyper-connected world, clamoring for our attention. Ultimately, I wrote this book to talk frankly about how I apply mindfulness techniques to harness this power at work — and in the rest of my world. Even though it can be messy and uncomfortable, the rewards for living a whole-hearted life are worth it.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn mental shifts and mindfulness tools that help ordinary people navigate life according to the authentic, essential self that animates each of us. (I've dubbed mine Gold Dust.)<br/><br/>Included are sections on:</p><p>Following Your Bliss: Learn how one woman's desire to become a surfer led to a career as a surf coach</p><p>Taking the Road Less Traveled: Meet people who've moved across the country and across the globe</p><p>Speaking Truth to Power: Discover an artist whose photography is expanding the conversations that dismantle structural inequalities</p><p> </p><h3>Who Is This Book For?</h3><p>If fear is holding you back, this book is for you. I Am Gold Dust (And You Are Too) is a non-fiction book that speaks to people who are disillusioned with the status quo and plagued by fears of failure or other people's opinions. This is for anyone looking for inspiration or how to practically apply mindfulness practices to connect with their authentic selves and navigate all areas of their lives using their inner compass.</p><p> </p><h3>The Book - I Am Gold Dust (And You Are Too)</h3><p>The book is written in three Parts:<br/><br/>Part One, “Becoming Gold Dust,” contains the Introduction and first three chapters which explain how I used to approach life — setting a goal and reverse engineering success, stacking up all the dominoes so they would fall precisely where I wanted them to land. Following society’s maps and adhering to the tenants of #hustle culture eventually turned on me. Burnt out and no longer able to use alcohol to dull the pain, I was desperate to learn how to be comfortable in my own skin. After my first trip to Camp Grounded, a Digital Detox camp in northern California, I began my quest to live a more authentic life in the workplace.<br/><br/>Part Two, “Following the Cosmic Breadcrumbs,” contains Chapters Four through Six and explores the mental models that help people follow their inner compass concerning life’s larger decisions.<br/><br/>Part Three, “Finding Your Inner Compass,” contains Chapters Seven through Ten which describe in clear, practical terms how to use mindfulness practices to connect with your authentic self to move through the messier, human aspects of life using your head AND your heart.</p><p> </p><h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p><ul>
<li>The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in April 2020</li>
<li>The Cover Design of my Book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder</li>
<li>The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats)</li>
<li>The Copyediting for My Book - to help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication</li>

Despite following the prevailing wisdom about “how to be successful,” I found myself completely burnt out at the age of 31, with a life that looked great on paper, but in reality was a complete sham.Over the past eight years, I’ve been on a journey to remain comfortable in my skin, regardless of the setting. This book explains the mental shifts and mindfulness practices that have helped others and myself navigate the messier parts of the workplace — and life — when conventional wisdom falls short.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover your own internal compass and learn how to follow your intuition — even when it means breaking from the pack. I’ll share various mindfulness practices and techniques have helped others and myself turn down the volume knob on the other voices in today’s hyper-connected world, clamoring for our attention. Ultimately, I wrote this book to talk frankly about how I apply mindfulness techniques to harness this power at work — and in the rest of my world. Even though it can be messy and uncomfortable, the rewards for living a whole-hearted life are worth it.In this book, you'll learn mental shifts and mindfulness tools that help ordinary people navigate life according to the authentic, essential self that animates each of us. (I've dubbed mine Gold Dust.)Included are sections on:Following Your Bliss: Learn how one woman's desire to become a surfer led to a career as a surf coachTaking the Road Less Traveled: Meet people who've moved across the country and across the globeSpeaking Truth to Power: Discover an artist whose photography is expanding the conversations that dismantle structural inequalities Who Is This Book For?If fear is holding you back, this book is for you. I Am Gold Dust (And You Are Too) is a non-fiction book that speaks to people who are disillusioned with the status quo and plagued by fears of failure or other people's opinions. This is for anyone looking for inspiration or how to practically apply mindfulness practices to connect with their authentic selves and navigate all areas of their lives using their inner compass. The Book - I Am Gold Dust (And You Are Too)The book is written in three Parts:Part One, “Becoming Gold Dust,” contains the Introduction and first three chapters which explain how I used to approach life — setting a goal and reverse engineering success, stacking up all the dominoes so they would fall precisely where I wanted them to land. Following society’s maps and adhering to the tenants of #hustle culture eventually turned on me. Burnt out and no longer able to use alcohol to dull the pain, I was desperate to learn how to be comfortable in my own skin. After my first trip to Camp Grounded, a Digital Detox camp in northern California, I began my quest to live a more authentic life in the workplace.Part Two, “Following the Cosmic Breadcrumbs,” contains Chapters Four through Six and explores the mental models that help people follow their inner compass concerning life’s larger decisions.Part Three, “Finding Your Inner Compass,” contains Chapters Seven through Ten which describe in clear, practical terms how to use mindfulness practices to connect with your authentic self to move through the messier, human aspects of life using your head AND your heart. What I Need & What You'll GetThis book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:
The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in April 2020

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><i>Finding Lavender</i> is a story about a sixteen-year-old girl discovering her forever home amongst new people which she never believed she would get along with. It is a story about family and togetherness.<br/><br/>My name is Lauren Morrone and I am the author of <i>Finding Lavender</i>. I wrote this book because I understand how hard it is to feel like an outcast. I understand how difficult it is to go through your teen years feeling like you don’t belong, and I want to gather people who also understand this in order to form a sense of togetherness and community.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that being different and having unique lives is okay—not only okay, but exceptional. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to become familiar with the intersections of finding your forever home, knowing that it is okay to ask for help, and the true meaning of family and community.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you’re a fan of YA contemporary books, looking for a relatable, representative high school story, or struggle with a sense of belonging.<br/><br/><i>Finding Lavender</i> speaks to teenagers and young adults who want to grapple with belonging and community in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Finding Lavender</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What defines a family?</li>
<li>How can I be more inclusive and understanding?</li>
<li>What is the importance of community and togetherness?</li>
</ul>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers.

</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Why do we need a Revolution of Love?</h3><p><b>Our Reality:</b></p><p></p>
<p>We hurt ourselves and each other in
countless ways. We fight ever more damaging wars. We are destroying nature. We
are depleting the natural resources of our planet. We are in slavery to the
attachments and revulsions of the mind.</p>
<p><i> - How are we going to survive, unless we open the heart?</i></p>
<p><b>Our Possibility:</b></p>
<p>We have the capacity for complete
clarity. Immense love and compassion and absolute fearlessness are our true,
inner nature. </p>
<p><i>-  How will we realize that, unless we open the heart?</i></p>
<p>With HeartSourcing we can learn to
live in a constant state of wholeness and love. This is the most potent
medicine known to humankind. This is how we can become the change we want to
see in the world!</p>

Why do we need a Revolution of Love?Our Reality:
We hurt ourselves and each other in
countless ways. We fight ever more damaging wars. We are destroying nature. We
are depleting the natural resources of our planet. We are in slavery to the
attachments and revulsions of the mind.
 - How are we going to survive, unless we open the heart?
Our Possibility:
We have the capacity for complete
clarity. Immense love and compassion and absolute fearlessness are our true,
inner nature. 
-  How will we realize that, unless we open the heart?
With HeartSourcing we can learn to
live in a constant state of wholeness and love. This is the most potent
medicine known to humankind. This is how we can become the change we want to
see in the world!
“Separation is an illusion.  Oneness is our birthright, and the way to claim is effortless: drop into the heart, again and again.” – Mirabai Starr

<p><strong>Update April 26th.</strong> With only 7 days to go, you can now get a piece of our historic basement. According to the monument protection agency, our basement appears to be a formet pit house (pre-medieval). In the layers of clay on the floor we found shards of various age - originating from 15th through 18th century. THE FIRST THREE people on each of the next 7 days, who donate a minimum of $20 will get three shards per mail (please leave your adress!). Check the galery for a picture!</p>

<p><strong>What's this about? </strong></p>
<p>You love reading mysteries &amp; thrillers set in Victorian London? You find kick-butt heroines rather magnetic? You have an insatiable craving for Sherlock Holmes? Welcome to the <a href=""http://www.kronbergcrimes.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong><em>Kronberg Crimes</em></strong></a> series!</p>
<p>The first book, <a href=""http://www.kronbergcrimes.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong><em>The Devil’s Grin</em></strong></a>, was published independently in September 2012 and did surprisingly well on the US market (Amazon’s #1 British Detective Mystery and #1 Historical Fiction in Febr/Mar2013. And nope, that didn’t result in riches).</p>
<p>Now, the second book in the series, <strong><em>The Fall</em></strong>, is finished and aching to see a top notch editor. You can read the first two chapters <a href=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/732597/files/20130331062115-FallExcerpt.pdf?1364736077"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
<p><em><strong> </strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Why help fund this project? </strong></p>
<p>I believe that a book gets better when readers can take part in the creative process of storytelling.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Devil’s Grin</em></strong>’s newest edition heeds readers’ advice and critique received on Amazon and Goodreads, on book blogs and Sherlock Holmes fan-pages.</p>
<p>To write an authentic Sherlock Holmes is not an easy undertaking. All books in this series are/will be beta-read by hard-core Sherlock Holmes fans to make sure Holmes truly remained Holmes.</p>
<p>Fellow authors and professional editors help to tighten the prose and sharpen the plot. At the end, you'll get a story that glues you to the book's pages (or e-reader's screen).</p>
<p><strong>And here comes the cherry for your cream cake</strong>: YOU can take part in creating the third in the Kronberg Crimes series!</p>
<p>You think you live in the wrong century? You miss the smell of eel-pie and horse manure when walking through London? Well, maybe then it’s time to share your thoughts with us on Facebook. We think that Holmes’s disappearance after the Reichenbach Falls must have been more than simply “going into hiding”. A man like Holmes wouldn’t just run away, would he?</p>
<p>The third in the <strong><em>Kronberg Crimes</em></strong> series will cover this period. A plot is laid out, but far from being completed. Take part in the creative process!

<p>If you’d like your name to be used for a character in <em><strong>The Fall</strong></em>, you have to be aware that this is a thriller/mystery series. You most likely end up as some creep. The more important your character is, the more expensive he/she is. You will also get a subscription to all Kronberg Crimes e-books in the series, a signed paperback and your name on our thank you list on the Kronberg Crimes website and in the acknowledgements of <em><strong>The Fall</strong></em>.</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><strong>What we need: </strong></p>
<p>$3500 US Developmental editing to force you one the edge of your seat and make you gnaw off your fingernails. This editor has previously worked on several NY Times Bestselling novels!</p>
<p>$500 US Line &amp; copy editing and killing any non-Holmesian slips, done by Carrie from the <a href=""stormypetrels.wordpress.com/2012/10/25/dancing-with-the-devil-review-of-devils-grin-and-interview-with-annelie-wendeberg/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""The Petrels of Crime"">The Stormy Petrels</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What we do, should we not reach our goal of $4000 US:</strong></p>
<p>This is a low risk project. The manuscript is written and I do all my cover art, book trailers, type-setting, and e-book formatting myself. Should the required budget not be reached, I'll have to get a cheaper editor. The less I'll be able to pay, the lower the quality of editing services (on avarage).</p>

experienced myself on two levels - the mind reeling in agony and my Wise Self determined to soar free of fear. I speak of these with raw honesty in my contemplative photography book - The Wise Self Within.</span>
</h3>
<p>I made extreme sacrifices to live a very simple lifestyle so I could
write this book. I sold my house and everything I owned - I needed time alone in nature to heal and to reconnect to
myself in a deeper way. I wanted to become the person that would
write this book. At times, it was a very lonely path. Frankly, I was a mess and this book had to be completed…so I could be completed as well. I had no idea the ride I was about to go on...</p><p>Read a reflection and see a photo at <a href=""http://www.areconnectedlife.com/reflection-sample-from-the-wise-self-within-bottled-up/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.areconnectedlife.com/reflection-sample-from-the-wise-self-within-bottled-up/</a></p>
<p>I want to
let others know they aren't alone. I want to inspire others to see life in a new light. I share my sloppy walk through life - so as
to inspire others to also walk the path home to healing. The photos evoke emotion, the reflections even can make you chuckle at this thing we call ""Life"" - each reflection ends with a Reconnection Tip that I use each day to remain connected to my center of stillness within - The Wise Self. It is my sincere wish that my book helps the world in some small way.</p>

Thank You - Thank You - Thank You !!!<p></p></div>","The essentials of my raw, honest contemplative photography...
13 years
ago life hit me with a triple sledgehammer: Divorce, Career Burnout and an Explosion of Intuitive Abilities. It took me on this solo journey to gather the
images in my book and finally let my words out…I
experienced myself on two levels - the mind reeling in agony and my Wise Self determined to soar free of fear. I speak of these with raw honesty in my contemplative photography book - The Wise Self Within.

I made extreme sacrifices to live a very simple lifestyle so I could
write this book. I sold my house and everything I owned - I needed time alone in nature to heal and to reconnect to
myself in a deeper way. I wanted to become the person that would
write this book. At times, it was a very lonely path. Frankly, I was a mess and this book had to be completed…so I could be completed as well. I had no idea the ride I was about to go on...Read a reflection and see a photo at http://www.areconnectedlife.com/reflection-sample-from-the-wise-self-within-bottled-up/
I want to
let others know they aren't alone. I want to inspire others to see life in a new light. I share my sloppy walk through life - so as
to inspire others to also walk the path home to healing. The photos evoke emotion, the reflections even can make you chuckle at this thing we call ""Life"" - each reflection ends with a Reconnection Tip that I use each day to remain connected to my center of stillness within - The Wise Self. It is my sincere wish that my book helps the world in some small way.
Get to know
me a bit at www.AReconnectedLife.com and see the work I have been doing
to prepare myself to complete this book! View testimonials too... 
Empower me to birth this manuscript into a bound book with gorgers color
photos!!!  So I may continue to inspire and empower others through my work.
Thank you for being my mid-wife to my Soul.
What I hope for - What I have for you...
I hope to raise $3000.00 to self publish my book. 
All money is used for self publishing. Every dime. Which includes:Design and Layout (Complex Interior Service due to Photographs)Professional Editing Cover DesignKirkus Indie Review of my Book (so as to give it a fighting chance!)Kindle FormattingISBN If I am gifted with more than my asking amount I plan to buy an LCD projector and go on tour in my car!  I want to share my photos and reflections with the world - anyone who will listen!  I have some events in the working and plan to continue to make contact. So any extra funds above the $3000 I am hoping for will go to very good use in presentations and some technology to share my reflections with others…and help them laugh along the way!
If I don't meet my goal the money that is contributed
will still go to fund the publishing of the book. For example if my
contributions accrued are only $679 then I will start phase one of the book
until I personally can raise the next set of funding. This manuscript will not
lay dormant for the rest of its life…I am determined to birth this elephant!

What I have for you...
Smiles Galore - $5 contribution you will be publicly thanked on my
professional Facebook page. 
Big Hug - $10 contribution you will receive a digital
photograph with an inspirational message and thanked publicly on my professional Facebook page.
High Five - $25 contribution you will receive a copy of

<p>My name is <strong>Denise Calhoun </strong>and I have written a handbook of activities for the elderly. My concern for the elderly stems from having been the primary caregiver of my mom for three years.  After observing her and other older family members as well as elderly residents in various homes, it became apparent that the quality of communication they were exposed to, not only affected their cognitive ability, but their emotional state of mind as well.</p>
<p>As an <strong>educator</strong> for over thirty years, I became interested in the similarities between young children and the elderly.  Through extensive research on the aging, while working on my master's degree, I noted the many symptoms that revealed characteristics of early childhood development.  In view of this awareness, my goal is to incorporate what I know about teaching children and applying it to helping the aging.</p>
<p>One of the <strong>key elements </strong>I found to sustaining <em>quality of life </em>was effective communication.  <strong>Handbook of Activities for the Elderly, </strong>therefore, was developed to stimulate minds and foster healthy development, mentally, physically, and emotionally.</p>
<p>The <strong>handbook </strong>includes activities in four domains of learning: physical environment, socio-emotional, nutrition/fitness, and language/cognition.  The primary purpose of this guide is to provide step-by-step directions for quick and easy <strong>hands-on </strong>activities to build strong communication skills.</p>
<p>This <strong>handbook </strong>will not solve all of the problems facing the elderly, but hopefully it will be a noteworthy attempt to contribute to the solution.  Through positive suggestions of <strong>Handbook of Activities for the Elderly, </strong>my dream is to make the world aware of how powerful meaningful communication is to sustaining <em>quality of life </em>for our elderly population.</p>

<h3>How Can You Help?</h3>

<p>Your donations will, therefore, help with promotional costs in spreading the word on how important meaningful activities, interaction, and communication are to sustaining <em>quality of life </em>for the aging.  Spreading the word would involve funding informational workshops and/or seminars on communication.</p>

My Story




Lesedi Books is a series of children’s picture
books focusing on the positive aspect of growing up in Africa. This campaign is for the first two books in the series: My Village and Lesedi's Favorite Game. I've written the books and I have an illustrator from South Africa working on the illustrations.

The books follow Lesedi, a ten-year old girl who lives in a rural
village in Botswana. Like Lesedi, I was born and raised in a small village in Botswana. Each book covers a specific topic about living in the village as seen though the eyes of Lesedi. The books are geared towards children between 7 - 12 years old. 
The Impact



 A couple questions I am frequently asked
since I moved from Botswana
are, “Did you see lions and elephants everyday?” and “Did you live in the
jungle?”  Most children’s view of Africa
is limited to what they see in the media and movies such as The Lion King. The
media typically depict African children as dirty, sick and hungry. There are
hardly any images of African children who live a normal life in the cities,
towns and villages. 

Stories are one of the most powerful ways to learn about
another culture. My goal is to publish picture books that show
children in normal day-to-day African life situations. I hope the picture books will
help children broaden their images and understanding of Africa
and to help them see African children in a different way.
Where I am At
I plan to publish these books through Village Life books which I founded in 2010 and based in Winnipeg, Canada. I published and released my first picture book, THE LION'S DECEIT (ISBN:  978-0-9867460-0-0), in May 2011 through Village Life Books. The Lion's Deceit reached #2 on the McNally Robinson Booksellers bestseller's list based on the sales for the week of September 25, 2011. I have also received author invitations to speak at schools.

My long term goal is to publish ten picture books in the Lesedi Books following the
main character, Lesedi, on her adventures in Mosetse village. I have
completed five manuscripts in the series and the illustrator has also started sketching out illustrations
for the first two books.


Where The Money Goes

I will continue with this project whether my funding goals are met or not, but your support will get me off the ground. The book production costs are very high and your participation will help with the production of the first
print run for My Village and Lesedi's Favorite Game books, including:

Completing the illustrations for the two books
Editing


Book printing


Promotional website 



Marketing the books

<p><em>What do I need all this dough for? </em>So I can vacation in Mexico for six months, obviously.  No kidding, book publishing is not free. I'm dedicated to bringing only the finest quality book to market. The finished product must be indistinguishable from anything published at Random House.  Anything to keep my book from looking like <a href=""http://cdn.sobadsogood.net/wp-content/uploads/10-worst-book-covers-in-the-history-of-literature-10.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Serious Badness."">this</a> will be money well spent.</p>

<li>
<strong>Structural Edit.</strong> Because let's face it, all books need one of these.</li>
<li>
<strong>Proofreading.</strong> Because what's sexier than good grammar?</li>

What do I need all this dough for? So I can vacation in Mexico for six months, obviously.  No kidding, book publishing is not free. I'm dedicated to bringing only the finest quality book to market. The finished product must be indistinguishable from anything published at Random House.  Anything to keep my book from looking like this will be money well spent.
Here's what we need to do to get it there:


Structural Edit. Because let's face it, all books need one of these.

Proofreading. Because what's sexier than good grammar?

Marketing. Because we plan to sell a zillion copies.

Cover Design. Because homemade covers are worse than day old bread.

Formatting. Because I would rather clean toilets in North Queensland for another four months than have to format that sucker myself.

Check out the sexy perks you get in return for your sexy contribution.  It's more than a virtual high-five, I promise. 


            Tah-Dah!! The Cover. So you see, it is a real book!

                            

""Yeah, so...what's the point""
The point, compadre, is to inspire others to break free. If this book inspires just one student to drop out of law school and start a band, one young woman to dump her boyfriend and stop dieting, or one other person, any person, to throw caution to the wind and start living the life he always dreamed of, it will be a great success.
As you may have guessed, the point is also to make some cash. I love to inspire, but I also love to cash cheques and buy expensive dresses. My publisher does too.


""I'm broke, yo! But I'd like to help you""

Make some noise, baby. Share this campaign with your friends. Tell them how awesome it is to break free and create the life you always wanted. Tell them you know someone who did it. 
Indiegogo has some sweet sharing tools you can use. Give the campaign a shoutout on Facebook. DM your mates on Twitter.  Email your homies with a link.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><strong>Brief Campaign Summary</strong></h2>
<p>Hi. I’m Dr. Jason Nicholas, otherwise known as “The Preventive Vet”. I’m a veterinarian on a mission to empower all cat and dog owners with the information, resources, and advice necessary to keep cats and dogs healthy, safe, and out of the emergency room.  [* <em>You can learn more about me and how I’m helping pets and their people by checking out my website at <a href=""http://www.ThePreventiveVet.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.ThePreventiveVet.com</a>.</em>]</p>
<p>I’m looking to expand my pet safety message beyond the internet and social media realms to the publishing world with two eye-opening, fun to read, and easy-to-digest <em><strong>pet safety tip books</strong></em> that I’ve just finished writing – one for cat owners, and one for dog owners – but I need your help to do so.</p>
<p><strong>The books are already written and WILL BE PUBLISHED regardless of the outcome of this campaign, I'm just hoping to raise (<em>at least</em>) $15,000 to help cover the costs of producing them (you can see the breakdown of where the money will be going further down in the campaign description)</strong>. So I’m turning to my strongest supporters, and indeed all pet lovers, to ask for contributions and help in spreading the word about these books. In exchange for your support, I’m offering great deals on the books, cool commemorative gear, and unique opportunities to honor and/or memorialize your pets.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/448239/pictures/full/20120918101507-Slide1.jpg?1347988578"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>These books will be great for pet owners of <strong><em>any</em></strong> experience level, and will especially make great gifts for any friends or family new to pet ownership. Your contribution and word-of-mouth will help me get these important books off my computer, into production, and into the hands of cat and dog lovers the world over. Thank you in advance for being a part of this wonderful movement that will help protect the health and safety of all cats and dogs – including yours!</p>
<p>Be Aware. Be Prepared. Be <em>Preventive!</em></p>
<p>Dr. Jason</p>
<p><strong><em>*Please continue reading below for more information about pet safety and my books, including sample pages. Video testimonials for me and The Preventive Vet can be seen by clicking the ""Gallery"" tab at the top of this page. If you'd like to add a video testimonial, please email it to me at <a href=""mailto:Jason@ThePreventiveVet.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jason@ThePreventiveVet.com</a> or post it on your Facebook page.

<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/381096/pictures/full/20120809232344-Benjamin_Franklin_Direct_From_Michael_With_quote_copy.jpg?1344579829"" src="""" style=""""/> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>The Problem</strong></h2>
<p>Every day, cats and dogs around the world suffer and die from injuries, illnesses, poisonings, and other emergencies. While not <em>all</em> are preventable,<em>many</em> are. In such cases, prior awareness and taking simple steps can help you keep your pets pain-free, healthy, and out of the ER.</p>
<p>But how do you become aware? How do you learn those simple steps?</p>
<p>After all, raising cats and dogs well and safely isn't always intuitive - they're different than us. Most cats and dogs, if given the chance, will get into all sorts of trouble. And they're susceptible to injuries, illnesses, and poisonings that many pet owners -- regardless of experience level -- would never even think of (and frequently only learn about once it's too late).</p>
<p>Here, try this short pet safety ""quiz"" to get a quick sense of how well-protected your pets are...</p>
<ul>
<li>What <strong>common ingredient of sugar-free gums</strong>, that's completely safe for people, can drop your dog's blood sugar to dangerously low levels and destroy their liver even with a small amount of exposure?</li>
<li>List 3 factors specific to your dog that can increase their risk for developing <strong>Heat Stroke</strong> (a devastating and quickly fatal emergency condition).</li>
<li>List 3 factors that increase your cat's risk for developing a <strong>urethral obstruction</strong> (a common, devastating, and quickly fatal emergency condition).</li>
<li>Name a type of <strong>ornate flower</strong> commonly found in bouquets and growing in gardens that can destroy your cat's kidneys, landing them in the ICU or worse, with even minimal exposure.</li>
<li>How can you quickly and reliably <strong>find a pet emergency hospital</strong> when traveling with your pets away from home?</li>
</ul><p>This is but a <em><strong>very</strong></em> small sample of the information that you need to know to protect your pets and to avoid a stressful, costly, time-consuming, and potentially heart-breaking emergency trip to the vet.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/381024/pictures/full/20120809221106-Wendy_face_close_up_With_text.jpg?1344575495"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Even if <em>you</em> ""aced"" this little quiz, please keep in mind that a great majority of pet owners don't - and their lack of awareness is contributing to preventable pain and suffering for a great many pets. I know this to be true - both because of the feedback I've gotten on my website and because of the number of preventable emergencies my colleagues and I see on a daily basis in the veterinary hospitals and emergency rooms all around the world.</p>
<p><em><strong>""One of the saddest parts of emergency veterinary medicine is seeing pets that have suffered illnesses or injuries that were potentially preventable. Dr. Nicholas has demonstrated a tremendous amount of passion and initiative by providing client education and public awareness in an effort to decrease the number of tragic cases seen at veterinary emergency clinics nationwide.""</strong></em> - Dr. Erika Loftin, DVM, Dipl. American College of Veterinary Emergency &amp; Critical Care</p>
<p>The whole goal of <a href=""http://www.thepreventivevet.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ThePreventiveVet.com</a> is to empower pet owners everywhere with the information, resources, and advice they <em>need</em> to keep their pets safe and well. Now I want to take that same online mission and expand it to the printed world! These books are chock full of vital information and easy-to-read, easy-to-implement tips for pet owners.. <strong><em>but</em></strong><em> </em><strong><em>I need your financial &amp; word-of-mouth help to publish them.</em></strong></p>
<div> </div>
<h2><strong>The Solution</strong></h2>
<p><em>""Starting Off On The Right Paw""</em> is the working title for the pet safety awareness and tips books I've written -- one book for cat owners, and one for dog owners. </p>
<p>Don't let the title fool you though, these books aren't <em>just</em> for those newly or recently undertaking pet ownership. The information, resources, and advice they contain will prove eye-opening and invaluable - even for experienced pet owners. These books will also be valuable to those who help busy pet owners care for their cats and dogs (pet sitters, dog walkers, groomers, veterinarians, etc.).</p>
<p>Like my website and other outreach, these books will help you improve and protect the health and safety of your pets! <strong>This isn't just my mission, it's my promise, too.</strong></p>
<p><em>What's covered in these books:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Awareness about the wide variety of foods and other substances around your home that can be devastating to your pet's health and wellbeing</li>
<li>Information and advice about the factors that affect your pet's risk of developing certain diseases or suffering certain emergency conditions</li>
<li>Information you need to be aware of when you travel with your pets</li>
<li>The simple steps you can take to prevent the vast majority of pet poisonings</li>
<li>Information and advice to prevent digestive upset in pets</li>
<li>Awareness and prevention tips for common holiday pet emergencies</li>
<li>Simple steps you can take around your house that can prevent urinary problems in cats </li>
<li><strong>And a <em>whole</em> lot more</strong></li>
</ul><p>These books are <strong>packed</strong> with information, tips, stories, resources, and illustrations that will increase awareness, preparedness, and prevention of many of the most common, costly, and debilitating illnesses and emergencies affecting cats and dogs today. And they will do so in an easy-to-follow and interesting-to-read ""quick tip"" style.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/381030/pictures/full/20120809221430-Slide1.jpg?1344575718"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Again, these books are already written!</strong> I just need your help to raise the funds (and awareness) to get them off my computer, into production, and into the hands and homes of those who love and care for pets.</p>
<p><strong>Where the money is going:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Obtaining ISBNs ($500)</li>
<li>Editing for two books ($1,300)</li>
<li>Layout &amp; design for two books ($2,000)</li>
<li>Cover &amp; interior illustrations for two books (varies by number and complexity of illustrations, between $8,000-10,000)</li>
<li>Printing costs for two books (varies by quantity, roughly $3,000-5,000)</li>
<li>Production &amp; shipping costs for rewards (dependent on types and quantities chosen, but well worth it :-)</li>
</ul><h2> </h2>
<h2>The Rewards</h2>
<p>In exchange for your backing of this project, I have created some great rewards. From great deals on the books themselves to the opportunity to have your pet illustrated to be the cover model for one of the books, there's lots to be had.</p>
<p>You can see the different rewards and packages I've put together on the right side of your screen. Backers at EVERY level will receive my deepest gratitude and that warm, fuzzy feeling of knowing that you are helping to protect and keep safe cats and dogs everywhere.

<h2>Answers to ""quiz"" questions:</h2>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Xylitol</strong> - a sugar alcohol. It's not <em>just</em> present in many sugar-free gums. It is also commonly found in toothpastes and mouthwashes, mints, baked goods for diabetics, and even in some brands of children's chewable vitamins. For more information on this deadly, but not well known about dog toxin, please see my blog post <a href=""http://www.thepreventivevet.com/_blog/The_Preventive_Vet/post/xylitol_and_other_lesser_known_pet_toxins/#.UA2Guo4XpUQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</li>
<li>The list of factors that influence your dog's risk for heat stroke includes their <strong>breed</strong> (brachycephalic or ""snub-nosed"" breeds and their mixes are at increased risk), their <strong>age</strong> (puppies and senior dogs are at greater risk),<strong>pre-existing medical conditions</strong> (laryngeal paralysis, collapsing trachea, brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome, heart disease, arthritis, obesity, and other chronic conditions increase their risks), a <strong>previous history of heat-related illness</strong>, and the<strong> environmental temperature and humidity</strong>. <em>Many</em> other factors can influence your dog's risk, too. For more information on the condition and what you need to know to prevent it, see my blog post <a href=""http://www.thepreventivevet.com/_blog/The_Preventive_Vet/post/Heat_Stroke_in_Pets/#.UA2Dmo4XpUQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</li>
<li>The factors that increase your cat's risk of developing urethral obstruction include <strong>eating dry food</strong>, <strong>too few litter boxes</strong> for the number of cats in the house, <strong>obesity</strong>, a <strong>stressful event</strong> in the home or family, and<strong>infrequent litter box scooping/cleaning</strong>. This is just a partial list though, for more information on this devastating and preventable condition, see my 3-part series of blog posts <a href=""http://www.thepreventivevet.com/_blog/The_Preventive_Vet/post/Pet_Emergency%E2%80%A6_Cat_Can%E2%80%99t_Pee!_Feline_Urethral_Obstruction_Part_1_-_Be_Aware/#.UA2FDI4XpUQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Lilies</strong> - The ""true lilies"" are <strong>highly toxic</strong> to cat kidneys, leading to acute kidney failure which is often fatal if not detected and treated early and aggressively. The ""true lily"" group includes <strong>Easter</strong> lilies, <strong>Stargazer</strong> lilies,<strong>Tiger</strong> lilies, <strong>Japanese</strong> <strong>show</strong> lilies, and <strong>Rubrum</strong> lilies.

</div></div>","Brief Campaign Summary
Hi. I’m Dr. Jason Nicholas, otherwise known as “The Preventive Vet”. I’m a veterinarian on a mission to empower all cat and dog owners with the information, resources, and advice necessary to keep cats and dogs healthy, safe, and out of the emergency room.  [* You can learn more about me and how I’m helping pets and their people by checking out my website at www.ThePreventiveVet.com.]
I’m looking to expand my pet safety message beyond the internet and social media realms to the publishing world with two eye-opening, fun to read, and easy-to-digest pet safety tip books that I’ve just finished writing – one for cat owners, and one for dog owners – but I need your help to do so.
The books are already written and WILL BE PUBLISHED regardless of the outcome of this campaign, I'm just hoping to raise (at least) $15,000 to help cover the costs of producing them (you can see the breakdown of where the money will be going further down in the campaign description). So I’m turning to my strongest supporters, and indeed all pet lovers, to ask for contributions and help in spreading the word about these books. In exchange for your support, I’m offering great deals on the books, cool commemorative gear, and unique opportunities to honor and/or memorialize your pets.
 

 
These books will be great for pet owners of any experience level, and will especially make great gifts for any friends or family new to pet ownership. Your contribution and word-of-mouth will help me get these important books off my computer, into production, and into the hands of cat and dog lovers the world over. Thank you in advance for being a part of this wonderful movement that will help protect the health and safety of all cats and dogs – including yours!
Be Aware. Be Prepared. Be Preventive!
Dr. Jason
*Please continue reading below for more information about pet safety and my books, including sample pages. Video testimonials for me and The Preventive Vet can be seen by clicking the ""Gallery"" tab at the top of this page. If you'd like to add a video testimonial, please email it to me at Jason@ThePreventiveVet.com or post it on your Facebook page. Thank you - sincerely :-)
 
 
The Problem
Every day, cats and dogs around the world suffer and die from injuries, illnesses, poisonings, and other emergencies. While not all are preventable,many are. In such cases, prior awareness and taking simple steps can help you keep your pets pain-free, healthy, and out of the ER.
But how do you become aware? How do you learn those simple steps?
After all, raising cats and dogs well and safely isn't always intuitive - they're different than us. Most cats and dogs, if given the chance, will get into all sorts of trouble. And they're susceptible to injuries, illnesses, and poisonings that many pet owners -- regardless of experience level -- would never even think of (and frequently only learn about once it's too late).
Here, try this short pet safety ""quiz"" to get a quick sense of how well-protected your pets are...

What common ingredient of sugar-free gums, that's completely safe for people, can drop your dog's blood sugar to dangerously low levels and destroy their liver even with a small amount of exposure?
List 3 factors specific to your dog that can increase their risk for developing Heat Stroke (a devastating and quickly fatal emergency condition).
List 3 factors that increase your cat's risk for developing a urethral obstruction (a common, devastating, and quickly fatal emergency condition).
Name a type of ornate flower commonly found in bouquets and growing in gardens that can destroy your cat's kidneys, landing them in the ICU or worse, with even minimal exposure.
How can you quickly and reliably find a pet emergency hospital when traveling with your pets away from home?
This is but a very small sample of the information that you need to know to protect your pets and to avoid a stressful, costly, time-consuming, and potentially heart-breaking emergency trip to the vet.

Even if you ""aced"" this little quiz, please keep in mind that a great majority of pet owners don't - and their lack of awareness is contributing to preventable pain and suffering for a great many pets. I know this to be true - both because of the feedback I've gotten on my website and because of the number of preventable emergencies my colleagues and I see on a daily basis in the veterinary hospitals and emergency rooms all around the world.
""One of the saddest parts of emergency veterinary medicine is seeing pets that have suffered illnesses or injuries that were potentially preventable. Dr. Nicholas has demonstrated a tremendous amount of passion and initiative by providing client education and public awareness in an effort to decrease the number of tragic cases seen at veterinary emergency clinics nationwide."" - Dr. Erika Loftin, DVM, Dipl. American College of Veterinary Emergency & Critical Care
The whole goal of ThePreventiveVet.com is to empower pet owners everywhere with the information, resources, and advice they need to keep their pets safe and well. Now I want to take that same online mission and expand it to the printed world! These books are chock full of vital information and easy-to-read, easy-to-implement tips for pet owners.. but I need your financial & word-of-mouth help to publish them.
 
The Solution
""Starting Off On The Right Paw"" is the working title for the pet safety awareness and tips books I've written -- one book for cat owners, and one for dog owners. 
Don't let the title fool you though, these books aren't just for those newly or recently undertaking pet ownership. The information, resources, and advice they contain will prove eye-opening and invaluable - even for experienced pet owners. These books will also be valuable to those who help busy pet owners care for their cats and dogs (pet sitters, dog walkers, groomers, veterinarians, etc.).
Like my website and other outreach, these books will help you improve and protect the health and safety of your pets! This isn't just my mission, it's my promise, too.
What's covered in these books:

Awareness about the wide variety of foods and other substances around your home that can be devastating to your pet's health and wellbeing
Information and advice about the factors that affect your pet's risk of developing certain diseases or suffering certain emergency conditions
Information you need to be aware of when you travel with your pets
The simple steps you can take to prevent the vast majority of pet poisonings
Information and advice to prevent digestive upset in pets
Awareness and prevention tips for common holiday pet emergencies
Simple steps you can take around your house that can prevent urinary problems in cats 
And a whole lot more
These books are packed with information, tips, stories, resources, and illustrations that will increase awareness, preparedness, and prevention of many of the most common, costly, and debilitating illnesses and emergencies affecting cats and dogs today. And they will do so in an easy-to-follow and interesting-to-read ""quick tip"" style.

 
 

 
The images above are some of Chuck Gonzales' past work - they are being shown here to demonstrate the general style in which he will illustrate these two books.
 
Again, these books are already written! I just need your help to raise the funds (and awareness) to get them off my computer, into production, and into the hands and homes of those who love and care for pets.
Where the money is going:

Obtaining ISBNs ($500)
Editing for two books ($1,300)
Layout & design for two books ($2,000)
Cover & interior illustrations for two books (varies by number and complexity of illustrations, between $8,000-10,000)
Printing costs for two books (varies by quantity, roughly $3,000-5,000)
Production & shipping costs for rewards (dependent on types and quantities chosen, but well worth it :-)
 
The Rewards
In exchange for your backing of this project, I have created some great rewards. From great deals on the books themselves to the opportunity to have your pet illustrated to be the cover model for one of the books, there's lots to be had.
You can see the different rewards and packages I've put together on the right side of your screen. Backers at EVERY level will receive my deepest gratitude and that warm, fuzzy feeling of knowing that you are helping to protect and keep safe cats and dogs everywhere. You'll also be mentioned in an upcoming ""thank you"" blog post for all my supporters, but I'd also love to thank you personally and in ""real time"". So please tweet to me (@PreventiveVet) and/or post on my Facebook page to let me know you contributed.
*If there's another bulk book quantity you'd like to order (for your rescue, shelter, practice, bookstore, etc) please just contact me (Jason@ThePreventiveVet.com) and I'll make it possible. Similarly, if there's another reward you'd like to see offered, just shoot me an email with your idea.
 

 
Below are images of some of the rewards and the answers to the quiz questions posed above. You can also see video testimonials from friends and fans of The Preventive Vet by clicking on the ""Gallery"" tab at the top of this page (above the project video).
Thank you so much again for your help in making these important books a reality! I'm excited to get them out there and into the hands of pet lovers everywhere so they can start making the difference I know they will. Stay tuned for updates, you're part of this pet safety movement now :-)

Answers to ""quiz"" questions:



Xylitol - a sugar alcohol. It's not just present in many sugar-free gums. It is also commonly found in toothpastes and mouthwashes, mints, baked goods for diabetics, and even in some brands of children's chewable vitamins. For more information on this deadly, but not well known about dog toxin, please see my blog post here.
The list of factors that influence your dog's risk for heat stroke includes their breed (brachycephalic or ""snub-nosed"" breeds and their mixes are at increased risk), their age (puppies and senior dogs are at greater risk),pre-existing medical conditions (laryngeal paralysis, collapsing trachea, brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome, heart disease, arthritis, obesity, and other chronic conditions increase their risks), a previous history of heat-related illness, and the environmental temperature and humidity. Many other factors can influence your dog's risk, too. For more information on the condition and what you need to know to prevent it, see my blog post here.
The factors that increase your cat's risk of developing urethral obstruction include eating dry food, too few litter boxes for the number of cats in the house, obesity, a stressful event in the home or family, andinfrequent litter box scooping/cleaning. This is just a partial list though, for more information on this devastating and preventable condition, see my 3-part series of blog posts here.

Lilies - The ""true lilies"" are highly toxic to cat kidneys, leading to acute kidney failure which is often fatal if not detected and treated early and aggressively. The ""true lily"" group includes Easter lilies, Stargazer lilies,Tiger lilies, Japanese show lilies, and Rubrum lilies. Some varieties ofday lilies can be similarly toxic, too. And it's not just the petals that are toxic - the stems, pollen, and even vase water can be deadly. For more information on the dangers of lilies in cats, please see my blog post here.
Until they put up blue ""H"" signs for pet hospitals along the Interstates, the best way to find a pet ER while on vacation is to check the website for either the Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care Society or theMyVeterinarian.com website maintained by the American Veterinary medical Association.

<p>Spy stories are fun, but <i>real </i>spy
stories are even cooler, and that is why I am so excited to tell you about a project I am working on. </p><p>I just recently inked a book deal with a London publisher to tell the real-life spy story of Curt Prüfer, a German spymaster, propagandist and intelligence analyst in the World War One-era Middle East. I will be translating the man's diaries and his official reports to the German Foreign Office from German into English and writing the accompanying explanatory text. My contract is signed, sent and delivered now, and I'm well into finishing the bulk of the translation of the diaries and reports.   </p><p>A few very important tasks remain:</p><ul>
<li>I will need to travel abroad (and within the US) to find further records of this man's nefarious wartime activities.</li>
<li>I will need to hire translators to help decipher some unreadable diary passages from German and translate some Turkish documents. </li>
</ul><p>I'm not getting any advance from my publisher, and I couldn't find any research grants that are geared towards independent historians like me. I've already spent much of my own money on making this book a reality, but I simply don't have the funds to take this project all the way to completion, and this is why  I've decided to take the crowd funding approach to financing my work. And this is where you come in. </p>Because you are the people who are going to help me make this happen. <p><br/></p><p>I have no financial support from publisher or academic institution to bring to the table, and I don't have the funds to finish the job. This means that you are my support. You and your networks of fellow spy-story fans, historians and history buffs that love intelligent real stories about intelligence operations in the age of empire, the making of the modern Middle East and World War I. <span style=""font-style: italic;""> </span> You, my team, my co-laborers in this work,<b style=""font-style: italic;""> </b>are the ones I am depending on to both fund the completion of this project, and and to spread the word to other potentially interested supporters. <br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/612470/files/20140529121906-CP.companions-001.jpg?1401391146"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p></p><p>So now, let me give you a brief summary of Curt Prüfer's story, just so you can see what I'm asking you to support. </p><p></p><p>The Germans lusted for a sphere of influence in the Ottoman-dominated Middle Eastern long before the outbreak of war in 1914. Years in advance, they hatched a plan that called for fomenting revolutions among disgruntled Muslim populations under the imperial domination of Germany’s enemies. The diversion of enemy troops from the main fighting front needed to put down these uprisings, they believed, would fatally dissipate enemy strength and give Germany the advantage needed for victory. When war did finally erupt in the summer of 1914, the Foreign Office immediately summoned a cadre of shadow warriors to the Middle East to put the subversion campaign plan into action. Among them was Curt Prüfer. </p><p></p><p>The plan failed in the end, and Germany
and its Turkish allies lost the war.  Bitter disillusionment and
an unwillingness to face Germany's responsibility for its loss consumed Prüfer in the years that
followed, and ultimately, he would channel his rage into a descending spiral of
anti-semitism and finally, Naziism. </p>
<p>Prüfer's record of his innermost
thoughts and doings in this period are important for a couple of reasons: 1). his writings open to the reader a perspective perfectly representing the
mindset typical of late European imperialism on the eve of its
collapse; 2). his documenting of interactions with the region's future movers and shakers also gives a foretaste of the modern Middle East that was even
then struggling to be born. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/612559/files/20140529124914-CP.Sinai-001_copy.jpg?1401392954"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>I first discovered this this guy while doing historical research for the book <i>Lawrence in Arabia </i>by Scott Anderson over the course of three years. The many other books I read about the activity of the Germans in the Middle East in this period used these materials in brief quotations, but none had tried to translate the entirety of the literary remains of this man's life for this time period. I had already translated large portions of it anyway, so I figured I'd plow ahead. </p><p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span><br/></p><p>This effort is going to take about $5,600. Funds raised will be used for the following things (in approximate amounts):</p><p></p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>Air fare to and from Europe and the Middle East (Berlin, Cologne, Istanbul, Jerusalem): $1950.</li>
<li>Lodging (about $35/night for 30 days): $1000</li>
<li>Payment to Ottoman Turkish translator: $750</li>
<li>Payment to German translator for correcting translation:
$1500</li>
<li>Miscellaneous administrative costs: $500</li>
</ul><p>I plan to make my trip abroad either in late August or early September, and the first version of the manuscript is due to my publisher by New Year's Eve this year. The expected date of publication will be sometime in the fall of 2015. </p><p>Just one other note I need to stress: I am self-employed, so when I take off into the blue to do my research this summer (and I will probably be gone an entire month!), I will not be drawing down any income, which makes this fund-raising effort all the more important. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/612530/files/20140529123638-00032u_copy.jpg?1401392198"" src="""" style=""""/></p>In return for your generous support, I'd like to invite you into the process of recreating this vanished world of spies, saboteurs, soldiers and politicians through my research and translation work.

<p></p><p></p></div>","Short Summary
Spy stories are fun, but real spy
stories are even cooler, and that is why I am so excited to tell you about a project I am working on. I just recently inked a book deal with a London publisher to tell the real-life spy story of Curt Prüfer, a German spymaster, propagandist and intelligence analyst in the World War One-era Middle East. I will be translating the man's diaries and his official reports to the German Foreign Office from German into English and writing the accompanying explanatory text. My contract is signed, sent and delivered now, and I'm well into finishing the bulk of the translation of the diaries and reports.   A few very important tasks remain:
I will need to travel abroad (and within the US) to find further records of this man's nefarious wartime activities.
I will need to hire translators to help decipher some unreadable diary passages from German and translate some Turkish documents. 
I'm not getting any advance from my publisher, and I couldn't find any research grants that are geared towards independent historians like me. I've already spent much of my own money on making this book a reality, but I simply don't have the funds to take this project all the way to completion, and this is why  I've decided to take the crowd funding approach to financing my work. And this is where you come in. Because you are the people who are going to help me make this happen. I have no financial support from publisher or academic institution to bring to the table, and I don't have the funds to finish the job. This means that you are my support. You and your networks of fellow spy-story fans, historians and history buffs that love intelligent real stories about intelligence operations in the age of empire, the making of the modern Middle East and World War I.   You, my team, my co-laborers in this work, are the ones I am depending on to both fund the completion of this project, and and to spread the word to other potentially interested supporters. 
So now, let me give you a brief summary of Curt Prüfer's story, just so you can see what I'm asking you to support. The Germans lusted for a sphere of influence in the Ottoman-dominated Middle Eastern long before the outbreak of war in 1914. Years in advance, they hatched a plan that called for fomenting revolutions among disgruntled Muslim populations under the imperial domination of Germany’s enemies. The diversion of enemy troops from the main fighting front needed to put down these uprisings, they believed, would fatally dissipate enemy strength and give Germany the advantage needed for victory. When war did finally erupt in the summer of 1914, the Foreign Office immediately summoned a cadre of shadow warriors to the Middle East to put the subversion campaign plan into action. Among them was Curt Prüfer. The plan failed in the end, and Germany
and its Turkish allies lost the war.  Bitter disillusionment and
an unwillingness to face Germany's responsibility for its loss consumed Prüfer in the years that
followed, and ultimately, he would channel his rage into a descending spiral of
anti-semitism and finally, Naziism. 
Prüfer's record of his innermost
thoughts and doings in this period are important for a couple of reasons: 1). his writings open to the reader a perspective perfectly representing the
mindset typical of late European imperialism on the eve of its
collapse; 2). his documenting of interactions with the region's future movers and shakers also gives a foretaste of the modern Middle East that was even
then struggling to be born. I first discovered this this guy while doing historical research for the book Lawrence in Arabia by Scott Anderson over the course of three years. The many other books I read about the activity of the Germans in the Middle East in this period used these materials in brief quotations, but none had tried to translate the entirety of the literary remains of this man's life for this time period. I had already translated large portions of it anyway, so I figured I'd plow ahead. What We Need & What You GetThis effort is going to take about $5,600. Funds raised will be used for the following things (in approximate amounts):

Air fare to and from Europe and the Middle East (Berlin, Cologne, Istanbul, Jerusalem): $1950.
Lodging (about $35/night for 30 days): $1000
Payment to Ottoman Turkish translator: $750
Payment to German translator for correcting translation:
$1500
Miscellaneous administrative costs: $500
I plan to make my trip abroad either in late August or early September, and the first version of the manuscript is due to my publisher by New Year's Eve this year. The expected date of publication will be sometime in the fall of 2015. Just one other note I need to stress: I am self-employed, so when I take off into the blue to do my research this summer (and I will probably be gone an entire month!), I will not be drawing down any income, which makes this fund-raising effort all the more important. In return for your generous support, I'd like to invite you into the process of recreating this vanished world of spies, saboteurs, soldiers and politicians through my research and translation work. In addition, I'd like to reward all of you who contribute with a number of exciting perks that will include shout-outs to you by name in the acknowledgement section of my book, signed copies of the book, cool ephemera (picture post cards and envelopes, coins, etc.) from the World War I-era Middle East, meetings with me, the author, etc.  If our funding campaign doesn't fully reach its goal, I will still receive what we did raise for a slightly higher fee to Indiegogo. The ImpactI fell in love with the Middle East the moment I set first set foot in the region when I went to work for an international non-profit organization in Jerusalem in 2004. The incredible friendliness and hospitality of its people drew me in immediately, but once I was able to walk its streets in person and to see with my own eyes the stone remnants of thousands of years of its history and culture, once I recognize the echoes of the ancient civilizations--Egypt, Sumeria, Babylon the great--which I had only read about in books as a kid, I loved it even more. Obviously, I am not the only one to catch a hankering for this beautiful, ancient part of the world. This crossroads between Europe, Asia and Africa has attracted the covetous desire of many nations over the centuries, and the struggle for its strategically-placed lands and its resources has made this region of the world...well, complicated, very complicated indeed. And this complexity is what makes the Middle East so interesting, particularly as its messy and complicated past still affects us westerners in many different ways today. It is especially interesting to note how much the happenings of today repeats the recent historical past in ways that are very instructive for the present.

We are of the firm belief that people should be paid for the work that they do.

<p>My name is Kevin. I represent a small but diverse group of international poets and event producers from the USA, Brazil, India, Great Britain, South Africa and the Netherlands. We all share one dream; To create the world's first social platform for and by poets, on and offline. We call it SPOKEN. This is the story; </p>
<p>It all began between the summer of 2006 and the fall of 2010, when I wrote and released three independent albums under the artist name BLAXTAR. During this time I received several Dutch Hiphop<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> awards</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> in Amsterdam. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">With the aim of bringing my message to a wider audience I began</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> performing my lyrics with no music, no entourage, only words. Now, all of a sudden, I was considered a poet rather than a rapper. This was well-received.  I invited my Hiphop colleagues, and we all loved to perform this way. The launch was amazing! </span></p>
<p>Light-bulb moment! </p>
<p>We created an event, SPOKEN: In The Presence Of Poets, in which the goal was to get people to really listen to lyrics. We added two more interactive elements through which the audience could get to know the person behind the artist.</p>

Inspired by the success of the pilot event we invited 'real' poets, comedians, authors and other expressive minds to come and perform alongside us Hiphop artists. There is a long list of non-Hiphop artists who have performed at SPOKEN with us, and loved it. 
Once we realized the potential of the concept we wanted to take the concept to other countries. It dawned on us that artistic and cultural experiences enrich people's lives. Great art and culture inspires people, brings people together and teaches us about ourselves and the world around us. In short, artistic and cultural experiences make life better.
Everywhere we came we met people with incredible talent for writing and performing. In addition to co-creating SPOKEN events with them we were also able to provide some artists the opportunity to travel and perform at SPOKEN events on the other side of the planet. 

 After 5 years we can safely say that SPOKEN has become an international platform. Without any structural financial backing we were able to connect SPOKEN to the poetry scene in São Paulo, New York, Paramaribo and Amsterdam. Poets in New Delhi, Johannesburg, London, Birmingham and Hong Kong have expressed eagerness to be a part of the current SPOKEN network. 

The Scope Of SPOKENfm We have used our Facebook page to invite people to send us their video performances. In this way we could curate the SPOKEN event in their own city or abroad. In one instance we chose two Dutch poets to come and perform at SPOKEN in São Paulo for example. What if SPOKENfm had it's own website, where artists can create their profile with lyric or poem videos, and through that profile get booked for SPOKEN events somewhere in the world! Wouldn't that be a revolution in and of itself? What if we could create the world's first social platform for international modern poetry entertainment, with artists who meet each other at SPOKEN events, co-create online, exchange thoughts and spread their ideas about social and economic topics in creative ways? The SPOKENfm website will enable poets and other writers/performers to:

create a profile with their work (video, audio, text)
earn credit by reviewing other artist's work 
connect to artists they like anywhere 
digitally co-create 
be booked by theaters for SPOKEN events (or affiliated programs)
activate several other tools that make it easier to be booked internationally
If a poem would be worth a plane ticket, what would that do with those that have never been able to leave their block, their city or their country? Obviously, the try outs we did were small scale events.

(The Winnipeg Youth Poetry Slam Team) is a team of four talented  young ladies who have been selected to represent our city in the YouthCanSlam National poetry competition in mid-August.  </p>
<p>Eva Rodrigues (15), Shaden Abusaleh (17), Shahad Abdulrazaq (17) and Amber Leenders (19) competed in this year's city-wide poetry slams and ranked as the top four youth poets in Winnipeg!</p>
<p>The girls are so excited to travel to Ottawa for YouthCanSlam, the national youth poetry slam!  This is an incredible opportunity for them to meet other young poets, attend various workshops and poetry performances by nationally recognized poets, and best of all, represent Winnipeg in the national competition.</p>
<p>Voices, Ink. is a non-profit, volunteer-based organization dedicated to creating opportunities for youth poets.  Although we are gaining momentum as an organization, we are seeking support from the community to send our first-ever YOUTH POETRY SLAM TEAM to nationals!</p>
<p> </p>

(The Winnipeg Youth Poetry Slam Team) is a team of four talented  young ladies who have been selected to represent our city in the YouthCanSlam National poetry competition in mid-August.  
Eva Rodrigues (15), Shaden Abusaleh (17), Shahad Abdulrazaq (17) and Amber Leenders (19) competed in this year's city-wide poetry slams and ranked as the top four youth poets in Winnipeg!
The girls are so excited to travel to Ottawa for YouthCanSlam, the national youth poetry slam!  This is an incredible opportunity for them to meet other young poets, attend various workshops and poetry performances by nationally recognized poets, and best of all, represent Winnipeg in the national competition.
Voices, Ink. is a non-profit, volunteer-based organization dedicated to creating opportunities for youth poets.  Although we are gaining momentum as an organization, we are seeking support from the community to send our first-ever YOUTH POETRY SLAM TEAM to nationals!
