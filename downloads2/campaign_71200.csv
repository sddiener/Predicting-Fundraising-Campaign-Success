<p>
</p>
<p>The Peculiarium (<a href=""http://www.peculiarium.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.peculiarium.com</a>)
is a unique, fun, unforgettable experience that has lived in its NW Thurman St.
location in Portland, Oregon for four years, since April 2011. A bunch of artists
and sci-fi enthusiasts, headed up by founders Mike Wellins and Lisa Freeman, came together to make a playground for the slightly
offbeat. Inside, visitors find nods to some of our favorite monsters, displays
of popular urban legends, irreverent artwork, interactive sights and sounds
that crack people up, make them shriek, and leave nearly everyone with a big
smile. Our displays are decidedly low-tech, but they’re one-of-a-kind, and they
all speak to the kid in us who loves creepy crawly things, B-movies and a good
scary story. </p>
Each year, sales and crowds have
increased and more and more people from all over the city, country, even the
world, have become fans of the underground goodness that is the Peculiarium. We’re delighted and humbled, and we’ve met
hundreds of amazing people who also think in creative, unique ways over the past four
years. We’ve had a great time creating new exhibits to explore, offering
extreme edible concoctions, and buying and selling unusual art, artifacts and ephemera. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1363732/files/20150407151239-IMG_3255.JPG?1428444759"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><br/><p>The <b>Mobile
Peculiarium</b> will be an awesome truck or trailer full of all the good things housed
in the Peculiarium, that comes to your neighborhood! If food carts can do it,
why not an oddities museum? Imagine a summer day in SE Portland when you get
the Tweet that Peculiarium is headed in your direction! For several hours, you
get the aliens, Bigfoot, and super-secret exhibits now in the development
stages, right in your own part of town. Maybe a show has just let out at a
popular music club downtown at midnight, and as you exit, you find the magical
Peculiarium just outside, open and ready for visitors. One day, the Peculiarium
lives in St. Johns. Another day, it caters to fans in Sellwood. We want to go where
our fans are! Private parties? Yes! Hire the freakin’ Peculiarium to conduct
its odd operations at your party! Just try to tell us that wouldn’t be your best
party all year. Street fairs in Seattle, Tacoma, Vancouver, Salem, Eugene, Roseburg? Why not! A mobile
Peculiarium will allow us to bring more original
exhibits and interactive displays with us to all our events! Using Twitter, Instagram, Facebook,
and eventually a locator app, our current location will be just a click away. </p>

<br/> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>So now that you have the image in your mind, consider what
it would take to make this happen. We, the Peculiarium founders,
are naturally frugal and clever people who will make the most of any resources,
and recycle and upcycle wherever possible, as we have always done. We can make
dollars go a long way, and that’s what we intend to do with this campaign. Our
budget includes a suitable box truck, trailer, or bus (size depends on how much funding
we can secure) that can comfortably accommodate museum visitors,
the licensing costs of the vehicle, a generator to run lighting and the exhibits, the retrofitting of current exhibits and
installation of new exhibits for the new space (two new exciting exhibits have
plans drawn up already), exterior design/paint, and the cost of mailing the thank-you perks to our wonderful contributors. After a  bunch of research and careful analysis, we've determined the total amount to make
this dream a reality is $24,565. Any funding that exceeds this amount goes even
further toward a bigger vehicle, more open hours &amp; days, further reach,
more elaborate exhibits, more original artwork &amp; one of a kind oddities for
YOU to enjoy. As a stretch goal, we hope to take the Peculiarium on a US tour
and bring this awesomeness to even more people. We've got friends in AZ, KS, PA, CA, IL, and more, all waiting for us to show up!<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We have tons of peculiar perks for you in return for helping us with our goal. Stickers, postcards, coloring books, comic books, T-shirts, original artwork, a private catered party in the new Mobile Peculiarium, and even a Life-Sized Bigfoot, made just for you!!</p>

<br/><ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<p>As we enter our 5th year in business and know our customers better, we think this is the perfect time to take the museum in directions that make it even more fun for the people who visit. To recap, our goals for this campaign are:</p>
<p>•to increase our exposure so that everyone in Portland and out-of-town visitors
alike can enjoy the Peculiarium experience.</p>
<p>•to have a sweet, self-contained mobile museum that we can operate anywhere,
any time</p>
<p>•to continue to come up with more wild and super-fun
exhibits that fit into a mobile rig. </p>
<p>•to allow Biggie to get out of the museum and become the Big
Ape/Man about town</p>
<p>•And to take advantage of current and emerging social media in order to
make our cool, bizarre experience easier for you to access!</p>
Please lay down some cash for this epic venture. You’ll love the prizes,
you’ll love the new mobile Peculiarium, and we’ll love you for it! We are very
excited about this project, and together, we can make the coolest mobile museum
and funhouse EVER! Shoot us a message if you have questions or suggestions. We’d
love to talk about it with you!

<br/><h3><b>FAQ</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>Will the store on Thurman St. stay open?</b></p>
<p>We don't have any plans to leave our original 
location. The mobile Peculiarium will be in addition to the brick and 
mortar shop. We don't know about the future, but we and our visitors 
love the pink building.</p>
<p><b>Will there be admissions charged?</b></p>
<p>It's possible that we will charge admission to 
the exhibit section of the mobile museum (not in the gift shop section),
 but we've decided it would never be more than $1-$2 per person.</p>
<p><b>How far will the mobile museum go?</b></p>
<p>We plan to go to all the suburbs of the 
Portland/Vancouver area, as many of our visitors are from these areas. 
Beaverton, Hillsboro, Tigard, Wilsonville, Gresham, Carver, Clackamas, 
Milwaukie, etc. With enough funding, we'd love to go on a US tour! 
That's our stretch goal. </p>
<p><b>Will the mobile be just like the store?</b></p>
<p>Short answer: yes. We'll scale down the food 
service in order to add more exhibits, but will probably still do some 
sort of peculiar snacks. Everything else will be for sale like in the 
shop. The number of things we have in the vehicle depend on the space 
inside the vehicle. It'll be a micro-version of the current shop.</p>
<p><b>What happens if you don't raise enough money?</b></p>
<p>We have very flexible and modular goals. In our 
first 12 hours, we raised $1400, which will already improve the presence of the 
street fairs we participate in quite a bit, in that we'll be able to 
retrofit a few exhibits for a smaller space. In addition, we're building
 a new Bigfoot that will sit inside the vehicle or outside at fairs, 
allowing people to take their pics sitting on his lap. Our current 
Bigfoot can't move from the shop due to his size and shape. Every dime 
we get will add to some part of our exhibits and displays. </p>

Please let us know if you have any other questions!<br/><p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Risks include not getting the word out to enough people about the fundraiser and making a very small amount of money in this campaign.  However, we are confident that we'll make the most of every penny pledged, and bring it back around to improving availability and a fun experience for our visitors.</p>
<p>Another potential challenge is that the idea of a mobile oddities museum is a relatively new concept, and one that some may have a hard time understanding. In our research, we've found some very successful and creative mobile shops in L.A., D.C., and other larger cities. Portland is well known as a smaller city whose residents have very big and brave ideas, and we think we fit right in. Our concept has proven to be a crowd-pleaser among those who know about us. Now we need to bring it to the rest of the city.<br/></p>
<p>In addition, food carts appear to be here to stay, much to our delight, and we plan to borrow their social media expertise and their success at small-space efficiency to help us establish this new way of reaching our favorite people.<br/></p>

<div><br/></div>
<p><b>Wer sind wir und warum machen wir all das?</b></p>
<div>Hallo Liebe Freunde &amp; Familien in der ganzen Welt, ich bin André Fiedler, wir haben einen einzigartigen Planeten, ich liebe Ihn und aller Geschöpfe, einschließlich dir. :)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Unser Team,
</div>
<div>besteht aus:</div>
<div>André Fiedler - Der Visionär &amp; Entrepreneur</div>
<div>Jan Diet - Der Stein in der Brandung und Adler der Lüfte</div>
<div>Frau Maier - Chefsekretärin und gut Seele bei Cocojambo</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Worum geht es bei Cocojambo?</b></div>
<div>Kokoswasser ist einer der Heilkräftigsten, gesündesten und leckersten Flüssigkeiten dieses Wundervollen Planeten. Es hilft bei Kranken die wieder gesund werden möchten oder gesunden die gesund bleiben wollen oder zu höchster Leistung streben.</div>
<div>Enthält große Mengen an Verjüngenden Cytokininen, Mineralien, Vitaminen, Enzymen, Eiweiß und ganz wichtig Spurenelementen, die wir alle brauchen.</div>
<div>Ist Lecker, hilft bei vielen Krankheiten und Beschwerden, es wird Wasser des Himmels genannt und wird heute noch als Heilwasser in Tropischen Ländern mit nachweisbaren Erfolg angewendet.</div>
<div>(ich könnte die ganze Seite nur mit den tollen Heilkräften des Kokoswassers voll schreiben, :D ) Es gibt schon jetzt seit neuem regelmäßig YouTube filme von Cocojambo wo wir viele Möglichkeiten der Anwendung und heilkräfte etc. zeigen. Das nächste ist ein Beautyfilm, mit einer Kosmetikerin eines großen Hotels ;) mehr wird noch nicht verraten, schaut es euch an.</div>
<div>Mit meiner Kampagne möchte ich genug Geld sammeln um 5L, 10L und 20L Packungen mit reinem frischen Kokoswasser in Deutschland zu dem bestmöglichsten Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis zu Verkaufen. (eine 5L Packung soll ca. 12€ kosten. So kann es sich jeder etwas für seine Gesundheit tun, auch Studenten und Großfamilien)</div>
<div>In dem wir den direkten Weg von Hersteller über uns bis zu dir wählen und nur das notwendigste einsetzen (kein Verschwendertum und keine Raffgier) bleibt das Geld nicht beim Importeur, Großhändler und im Ladengeschäft hängen. Somit können wir viel größere Mengen, von höchstwertigem Kokoswasser für alle bereitstellen. </div>
<div>Das Cocojambo - Kokoswasser, kann dann auf unserer Homepage (die wir mit dem Geld der Kampagne unter anderem erstellen lassen können) ganz einfach ab Anfang Juni bestellt werden.</div> <p><b>Durch deine Spende oder Hilfe, passieren folgende Dinge:</b></p>

Wer sind wir und warum machen wir all das?
Hallo Liebe Freunde & Familien in der ganzen Welt, ich bin André Fiedler, wir haben einen einzigartigen Planeten, ich liebe Ihn und aller Geschöpfe, einschließlich dir. :)

Unser Team,

besteht aus:
André Fiedler - Der Visionär & Entrepreneur
Jan Diet - Der Stein in der Brandung und Adler der Lüfte
Frau Maier - Chefsekretärin und gut Seele bei Cocojambo

Worum geht es bei Cocojambo?
Kokoswasser ist einer der Heilkräftigsten, gesündesten und leckersten Flüssigkeiten dieses Wundervollen Planeten. Es hilft bei Kranken die wieder gesund werden möchten oder gesunden die gesund bleiben wollen oder zu höchster Leistung streben.
Enthält große Mengen an Verjüngenden Cytokininen, Mineralien, Vitaminen, Enzymen, Eiweiß und ganz wichtig Spurenelementen, die wir alle brauchen.
Ist Lecker, hilft bei vielen Krankheiten und Beschwerden, es wird Wasser des Himmels genannt und wird heute noch als Heilwasser in Tropischen Ländern mit nachweisbaren Erfolg angewendet.
(ich könnte die ganze Seite nur mit den tollen Heilkräften des Kokoswassers voll schreiben, :D ) Es gibt schon jetzt seit neuem regelmäßig YouTube filme von Cocojambo wo wir viele Möglichkeiten der Anwendung und heilkräfte etc. zeigen. Das nächste ist ein Beautyfilm, mit einer Kosmetikerin eines großen Hotels ;) mehr wird noch nicht verraten, schaut es euch an.
Mit meiner Kampagne möchte ich genug Geld sammeln um 5L, 10L und 20L Packungen mit reinem frischen Kokoswasser in Deutschland zu dem bestmöglichsten Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis zu Verkaufen. (eine 5L Packung soll ca. 12€ kosten. So kann es sich jeder etwas für seine Gesundheit tun, auch Studenten und Großfamilien)
In dem wir den direkten Weg von Hersteller über uns bis zu dir wählen und nur das notwendigste einsetzen (kein Verschwendertum und keine Raffgier) bleibt das Geld nicht beim Importeur, Großhändler und im Ladengeschäft hängen. Somit können wir viel größere Mengen, von höchstwertigem Kokoswasser für alle bereitstellen. 
Das Cocojambo - Kokoswasser, kann dann auf unserer Homepage (die wir mit dem Geld der Kampagne unter anderem erstellen lassen können) ganz einfach ab Anfang Juni bestellt werden. Durch deine Spende oder Hilfe, passieren folgende Dinge:



Wir erstellen eine ansprechende Homepage


Wir gehen vor Ort und überprüfen das nur 100% Kokoswasser in bester Qualität bei dir ankommt. (Das werden wir regelmäßig auf unseren Portalen veröffentlichen)


Das Design, Logo etc. für Homepage, Produktkartons, T-Shirts werden Produziert


Der erste Kontainer wird bestellt


Wir bezahlen den ersten Teil der Helden die uns bis hier her geholfen haben.


Die ersten Marketingaktionen beginnen und viele Menschen können das gesunde und reine Cocojambo Kokoswasser erleben.


Die Regionale Wirtschaft wird direkt in Sri Lanka sowie in deiner Nähe unterstützt. Das Geld bleibt durch unsere Regionalen Zahlungsmöglichkeit direkt in der vor Ort und stärkt somit alle in deiner Umgebung


   Was du uns gibst & was du bekommst



Wir haben um die ersten Schwierigsten Hürden zu überwinden 10.000€ eingeplant. Jede Ausgabe von diesen 10.000€ wird auf unserer Homepage eingetragen, so hast du immer den Überblick was gerade mit deiner Spende gemacht wird. (Wir beweisen das es sehr wohl Möglich ist, mit einer offenen Preispolitik zu wachsen. Wer weiß vielleicht nehmen irgendwann auch andere Firmen oder die Politik sich ein Vorbild daran. Fairness für alle! :D )

kleines Beispiel für die ersten 3Monate (ca.Beträge): Homepage 450€, Logo 250€, Online-Marketing 1.500€ (für den Anfang), Import kleiner Kontainer 2.500€ und noch sind keine Produkte bezahlt, du siehst wir Kalkulieren nur das notwendigste und trotzdem wird es teuer und alleine nicht zu bewältigen.

</div></div>","Going ""Green"" is great, but we decided to take it to a whole new level with PIC.  PIC (Preserve in Community) is a groundbreaking platform that creates real action to preserve and protect ecosystems around the world.Our first PIC parkNuestro video subtitulado al Español / Gracias por apoyarnos! As seen on:  CNN Chile    Estrategia On-line
 Publimetro         Red Pacto GlobalWHY PIC PIC is a platform with the ultimate goal of creating natural parks by preserving different ecosystems around the world. PIC’s objective is to create the largest community of preservers in the planet, by enabling people to take real action by choosing specific spots of land around the world and preserving them. The land that you choose will be preserved forever and you'll become a co-founder of each park in which you choose to participate in and will be able to visit this park anytime you want... for as little as 1 dollar!  Each park has a number of PICs to be preserved (1 PIC = 1 dollar = 1 square meter). When the total number of PICs for each park is reached, a PIC PARK will be created. PIC Foundation (non-profit) will be the sole owner of each PIC PARK and will have the mission of ensuring each park is preserved in the best posible way, working with local communities and hiring environmental experts to asses the best way to preserve each park.WHY WE'RE HERE We're launching this Indiegogo campaign to fund the first PIC PARK... the first natural park created by and for people!! We chose Patagonia in the south of Chile as our first PIC PARK. As you can see, this is a huge project with a massive impact and a global scale but we need to start with this first park to show the world that preserving our planet is something we can all do! We have worked tirelessly over the past year around building the technological platform which supports PIC, and now we need $200,000 to fund this first PIC Park (securing the land, hiring environmental experts to study and asses the best ways to preserve this park, building a camping site, park amenities and trails for future PIC visitors) and finish developing the technology behind PIC which will enable the preservation of countless natural parks all around the world!
THE IMPACT
This will be a real ENVIRONMENTAL REVOLUTION!
For the first time ever, preservation will be possible for anyone and anywhere, with the click of a button.  Help us bring this amazing project to life. Our goal is not only to create the largest preservation platform in the planet, but we also want people to get involved with nature. We want people to visit the ecosystems they are preserving and see the real impact they are doing!HOW IT WORKS & WHAT YOU GET
It's simple. A PIC is ONE dollar for ONE square meter.
When you preserve a PIC, your selfie will be part of  a PIC MAP for that particular park and
your name will be written on a PARK MILESTONE. The more PICs you preserve, the
larger your face will be shown on the PIC MAP. You will also be able to visit

<p>La sangría DON PEPE es un producto con
muchos años de historia aunque la chispa saltó en el festival #ilovesucina, en una caseta de cócteles que montamos para dar mayor atractivo turístico y comenzamos a servir la sangría que mezclamos con amor y pasión desde
los años 80, una sangría que fuimos evolucionando y transformando. En la inauguración de la caseta de cócteles nos dejo impresionado el hecho de que nuestra sangría que añadimos como un cóctel más, se convirtió en días, en la bebida más consumida por encima de la cerveza; entonces nos preguntamos, por qué no elaboramos esta deliciosa bebida y la embotellamos. Y la respuesta aquí esta, embarcados en un proyecto maravilloso y un producto único que queremos distribuir en cada rincón del planeta.</p>
<p>Sangria DON PEPE bears long years of history although the spark triggered off in the  Festival #ilovesucina, in a cocktail hut that we installed to increase the touristic appeal and we started serving the sangria that we had been mixing with love and passion since the 80´s, a sangria which has evolved and has been transformed. In the opening of our cocktails hut we were shocked by the fact that our sangria, offered just as an additional cocktail, turned in a few days, in the most consumed drink ahead of beer. Then we asked ourselves: why don't we produce this drink and bottle it? And here you are the answer; we are embarked on a wonderful project with a unique product that we want to distribute to every corner of the planet.<br/></p>

<p></p>
<h3>¿Por qué la sangría Don Pepe es diferente?<br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Nuestra sangría se elabora en tres
fases: 
</p>
<p>1.- Maceramos un excelente joven
tempranillo de Jumilla  con trozos frescos de manzana, pera, uva,
plátano, melocotón, fresas y unas pinceladas de vainilla y canela,
durante 24 horas.</p>
<p>2.- Exprimimos una selecta elección de naranjas, limones, mandarinas y limas en su punto óptimo de maduración y le añadimos azúcares de caña, dejando reposar otras 24
horas.</p>
<p>3.- Mezclamos 9 licores distintos en
sus diferentes medidas y ponemos en barricas durante 24 horas.<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Transcurrido ese tiempo, lo dejamos un día más para luego filtrarlo y embotellarlo.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i><b>¿Ya sabes por qué la Sangría Don Pepe
es deliciosamente diferente?</b></i></p>
<p><i><b></b></i></p>
<p>Why is Sangria Don Pepe different?</p>
<p>Our sangria is produced in three stages: </p>
<p>1. - An excellent early maturity Jumilla wine gets steeped with fresh pieces of apples, pears, grapes, bananas, peaches, strawberries and a bit of vanilla and cinnamon for 24 hours.</p>
<p>2. - A select range of oranges, lemons, mandarins and limes at their optimum ripening are squeezed, cane sugar is added and it all let settling for 24 hours more.</p>
<p>3. - It gets mixed with 9 different liquors with their corresponding amounts and placed in barrels for 24 hours.</p>
<p>After this time has elapsed, one more day and it gets filtered and bottled.</p>
<p>¿Do you already know why Sangria Don Pepe taste deliciously different?</p>

Y la respuesta aquí esta, embarcados en un proyecto maravilloso y un producto único que queremos distribuir en cada rincón del planeta.
Sangria DON PEPE bears long years of history although the spark triggered off in the  Festival #ilovesucina, in a cocktail hut that we installed to increase the touristic appeal and we started serving the sangria that we had been mixing with love and passion since the 80´s, a sangria which has evolved and has been transformed. In the opening of our cocktails hut we were shocked by the fact that our sangria, offered just as an additional cocktail, turned in a few days, in the most consumed drink ahead of beer. Then we asked ourselves: why don't we produce this drink and bottle it? And here you are the answer; we are embarked on a wonderful project with a unique product that we want to distribute to every corner of the planet.
En el siguiente vídeo vemos una degustación de Don Pepe con un grupo de amigos.

¿Por qué la sangría Don Pepe es diferente?


Nuestra sangría se elabora en tres
fases: 

1.- Maceramos un excelente joven
tempranillo de Jumilla  con trozos frescos de manzana, pera, uva,
plátano, melocotón, fresas y unas pinceladas de vainilla y canela,
durante 24 horas.
2.- Exprimimos una selecta elección de naranjas, limones, mandarinas y limas en su punto óptimo de maduración y le añadimos azúcares de caña, dejando reposar otras 24
horas.
3.- Mezclamos 9 licores distintos en
sus diferentes medidas y ponemos en barricas durante 24 horas.


Transcurrido ese tiempo, lo dejamos un día más para luego filtrarlo y embotellarlo.


¿Ya sabes por qué la Sangría Don Pepe
es deliciosamente diferente?

Why is Sangria Don Pepe different?
Our sangria is produced in three stages: 
1. - An excellent early maturity Jumilla wine gets steeped with fresh pieces of apples, pears, grapes, bananas, peaches, strawberries and a bit of vanilla and cinnamon for 24 hours.
2. - A select range of oranges, lemons, mandarins and limes at their optimum ripening are squeezed, cane sugar is added and it all let settling for 24 hours more.
3. - It gets mixed with 9 different liquors with their corresponding amounts and placed in barrels for 24 hours.
After this time has elapsed, one more day and it gets filtered and bottled.
¿Do you already know why Sangria Don Pepe taste deliciously different?

<p><span>Hub + Spoke Cycleworks is our type of community center. We fabricate, paint, customize, and build many different types of bicycles, but that is simply the material product of a lifestyle obsession we love. In more ways than one, riding bicycles and the people we have met through that act have forever changed our lives. Our main goal is to provide a space that makes this positive opportunity available to others. A place where inspiration, knowledge, creativity, and passion will always be shared. An environment that respects the individual for more than just the subculture they belong to. For us the Hub is a place where we can all feel at home.</span></p>
<p>Hub + Spoke Cycleworks is unlike any other shop in the San Diego County area. We are located at 1545 Tidelands Avenue in National City, CA approximately one mile from the San Diego city border. Our location is on the Bayshore Bikeway that completes a full loop around the southern portion of the San Diego Bay separated by the historic Coronado Bridge. Having a location with the correct industrial zoning was a priority for us in order to bring the community into the process of bicycle manufacturing. At any time of the day our customers can stop by and possibly view a bicycle frame being brazed together, a completed frame being prepped for custom paint, or a complete build happening in the service stand. Building on our sense of community we will have movie nights with a projector showing fun or historical bicycle films with seating for around 25 people, doubling as space for local bicycle advocacy meetings and bicycle maintenance classes. Finding a space with the appropriate zoning and interior space was great, but add the consistent bicycle traffic passing by daily and it created a perfect foundation to spread our message to the community.</p>
<p>Hub + Spoke will offer low cost, basic education classes to cyclist interested in how and why the bicycle functions as it does. The syllabus has been created, tested, and modified by our Service Manager Kate Cowper over the last year. Our classes will educate students about bicycle components, their specific functions, how to make adjustments, and even wheel truing. Classes will be kept to an intimate size of 6 people, each with their own basic tool set, so that everyone has the opportunity to have their hands on their own bicycle during the lab portion. The purpose of these classes is to empower the everyday or recreational cyclist by providing them with the knowledge to make basic repairs on the road if needed. To us this basic knowledge is just as important as keeping a patch kit and tire lever in your seat bag.</p>
<p>For those interested in expanding on their mechanical knowledge, we will offer a fully stocked tool bench and repair stand that will be available to rent by the hour. All tools on this bench are completely new and will be replaced as needed to insure the safety of the user. The individual will have the opportunity to perform service on their personal bicycle in a clean and safe environment. Support and final safety checks will be provided after each session by the Hub + Spoke Service Manager Kate Cowper.</p>
<p>Another unique aspect of Hub + Spoke is our community outreach. In the last year alone we have donated our time to help non-profit bicycle advocacy organization BikeSD by participating in free bicycle clinics for the less fortunate at Alpha Project at the downtown San Diego Library. We primarily act as mechanics in these situations, bringing tools, mobile repair stands, and tubes to get the individuals bicycles back in safe working order. With another advocacy organization, The San Diego County Bicycle Coalition, we have participated in “bicycle rodeos” at local elementary schools. These events help to teach the youth of our surrounding communities about basic bicycle safety so that they can further enjoy the act of riding bicycles later into their lives. They are also a lot of fun too. We look forward to expanding on these programs in the coming years.</p>
<p>What we need and why:</p>
<p>We are asking for funding to help us complete the building of student work benches, the purchasing of personal tool kits, syllabus materials, and some of the time we will spend hosting low cost maintenance courses and free community outreach programs. Here is a basic breakdown:</p>
<p>Maintenance Course personal tool kits for 6 individuals = $360.00</p>
<p>Work benches for 6 individuals (includes the Co-op bench) = $1000.00</p>
<p>Syllabus Packets for one year of classes = $1000.00</p>
<p>A modest fuel fund for transportation to community clinics, school rodeos, and other events.</p>Hub + Spoke is hoping to raise $3000 to $5000 to help us complete our projects and programs as soon as possible. We are dedicated to providing these services to the community if we reach our fundraising goal or not. In the last six months Hub + Spoke has invested over 20 thousand dollars on our dream and we want to thank everyone for their consistent love and support during this process. Regardless if you are able to provide us with a donation or not, please share our dream with your cycling friends and family. Stay classy San Diego. <br/>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Kasey loved seeing photos of the places where I used to live in Spain, she dreamed of visiting them and I dreamed of taking her.  </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I spent over two years researching different strategies to help a child like Kasey </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">be able to enjoy a 'normal' holiday abroad.   I also had to find the right environment for our holiday rental as there couldn't be too many people and it couldn't be too noisy as excessive noise and crowds are likely to cause a violent behaviour melt down.  </span></p>

<p>Our holiday properties will be for all families and groups including birth, adoptive or foster families and residential or charitable groups - all are welcome.  They are <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">primarily for families caring for children and young people with any SEBD condition </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> that may cause the children to become disruptive or violent when they become stressed or overwhelmed, but are suitable for anyone who responds to sensory therapeutic environments.  Common conditions that result in challenging behaviours are Autism, Attachment Disorders (AD), ADHD and Sensory  Perception Disorder but there are many more.</span></p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<h4><b>Sensory rooms are a proven therapeutic, relaxing and calming tool for children and adults. </b></h4>
<p>For children with conditions such as Autism, ADHD, AD they provide an oasis of calm  where children can regulate their anxieties and meltdowns and outbursts can be averted.  Should a child already be having an outburst a sensory room can help them to calm down quickly and control their anxiety.  </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Children and young people with developmental or mental health conditions that affect behaviour can find normal, everyday activities frightening.    Simple thing like needing to pop to the shops for a pint of milk can result in a violent melt down if it's  unexpected and not part of the child's daily routine. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p><b>Research states that the brains of children with these problems do not work the same way as 'normal' brains.  Autistic brains don't recognise signals and 'fire' in a different way.  In Attachment Disorders, the children literally have holes in their brains as a result of their early life experiences. The bits that teach us caring, compassion and how to be 'good' simply aren't there. </b></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Parents and carers of children with SEBDs really do need a break more than most yet are often unable to enjoy a relaxing holiday due the their child's behaviours which can be violent, abusive and destructive.   Carers may be frightened to take them anywhere out of the ordinary in case the child has a massive meltdown and causes upset to other holiday makers or damage to the property.  Our coaching plans will help you prepare your child for a holiday abroad and our properties will be designed in such a way that even if a child has a violent outburst damage will be minimised.  We won't mind if your child draws on our walls either!  </span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We will risk assess each Sensory House so that you don't have to.  We will also include additional features such as a lockable cupboard for medications  and at least one door that can be locked so vulnerable items can be kept safe if a child should become destructive.  Each Sensory House will meet the same high Health &amp; Safety standards required for foster homes in the UK.  </span></p>

These have been devised with the help of a social worker and successfully trialed by myself with my daughter who has AD and ASD.  There will be two plans:</p>

INTRODUCING 
SENSORY HOUSE HOLIDAYSOrdinary Holidays for Extraordinary children.
Enabling families caring for children with Social & Emotional
Behavioural Difficulties (SEBD) to have a 'NORMAL' family holiday. WHAT IS A SENSORY HOUSE HOLIDAY
Our dream is to offer a selection of specialist sensory holiday rental homes to families
caring for children with challenging behaviours.  The house will be suitable for children and young people with  Autism, Attachment Disorder,  Sensory Perception Disorder or any condition where the child responds to a sensory environment when anxious or angry. 
Each of the
specialist holiday homes  will have at least one sensory bedroom and one
sensory play area.    The locations will be carefully researched
and selected to provide a range of environments to suit children of differing
needs.  Our goal is to provide a variety of SENSORY resources and activities in each property.  The exact contents will differ according to the type of property but there will be core elements in all of them.  These will include:
sensory lighting such as multi projectors and bubble tubes.
soft play, tactile, fidget and chew toys. 
'safe space' dens - areas where the children can 'hide' but still be safe 
big squidgy cushions and bean bags, lots of squidginess.
variable textures on floors and walls.
places for children to draw  and scribble - sometimes on the walls! 
a 'swinging' den such as a cocoon or a hammock. 
sand and water play will be provided in outside spaces. 
speaker systems so you can play your own 'white noise' or music.We want to be create both calming and stimulating areas to help minimise anxieties for children with challenging behaviours and help them to remain calm.    




WHY
My name is Denise Searle and I'm a Therapeutic Foster Carer.  When I started caring for my foster daughter Kasey* four years ago 'normal' ceased to exist.   She is diagnosed with Attachment Disorder and has many autistic traits,  she becomes violent and destructive when anxious or scared.   Her behaviour is so challenging there are times when I can't get her to leave the house.   Going on holiday anywhere seemed an impossibility and going abroad was something I used to do.    (*name changed).
Kasey loved seeing photos of the places where I used to live in Spain, she dreamed of visiting them and I dreamed of taking her.  I spent over two years researching different strategies to help a child like Kasey be able to enjoy a 'normal' holiday abroad.   I also had to find the right environment for our holiday rental as there couldn't be too many people and it couldn't be too noisy as excessive noise and crowds are likely to cause a violent behaviour melt down.  
We finally enjoyed our first holiday abroad last year, 3 years after she first came to live with me.  Not only was it a lovely holiday for us but the experience has helped to raise her self esteem and confidence.  It has empowered her by showing her she can achieve things she thought were impossible.  

I have used my experience and research to create Sensory House Holidays with my good friend Chris who has donated the use of a property in which to create our first Sensory House.  

The first Sensory House is in the village of Torrox, a traditional whitewashed village in Andalucia, Southern Spain.   We are currently researching different locations for our second Sensory House and plan to have a variety of properties in different areas throughout Andalucia including coastal and rural locations.  
All properties
will be accessible to usual holiday facilities such as beaches and water
parks, bars and restaurants or inland villages, but will be located away from the centre of activity. We will select quieter locations where the families can quickly retreat to if the child is
becoming anxious or distressed.


WHO IS A SENSORY HOUSE HOLIDAY FOR
Our holiday properties will be for all families and groups including birth, adoptive or foster families and residential or charitable groups - all are welcome.  They are primarily for families caring for children and young people with any SEBD condition  that may cause the children to become disruptive or violent when they become stressed or overwhelmed, but are suitable for anyone who responds to sensory therapeutic environments.  Common conditions that result in challenging behaviours are Autism, Attachment Disorders (AD), ADHD and Sensory  Perception Disorder but there are many more.
HOW WILL SENSORY ROOMS HELP

Sensory rooms are a proven therapeutic, relaxing and calming tool for children and adults. 
For children with conditions such as Autism, ADHD, AD they provide an oasis of calm  where children can regulate their anxieties and meltdowns and outbursts can be averted.  Should a child already be having an outburst a sensory room can help them to calm down quickly and control their anxiety.  
Children and young people with developmental or mental health conditions that affect behaviour can find normal, everyday activities frightening.    Simple thing like needing to pop to the shops for a pint of milk can result in a violent melt down if it's  unexpected and not part of the child's daily routine. 


Research states that the brains of children with these problems do not work the same way as 'normal' brains.  Autistic brains don't recognise signals and 'fire' in a different way.  In Attachment Disorders, the children literally have holes in their brains as a result of their early life experiences. The bits that teach us caring, compassion and how to be 'good' simply aren't there. 



(image: Dr. Bruce Perry, Reactive Attachment Disorder, society and children)
Attachment disorder is often seen in children who have been severely neglected or abused at a very young age but it can also occur in well cared for, well nurtured children who experience a trauma.  
Parents and carers of children with SEBDs really do need a break more than most yet are often unable to enjoy a relaxing holiday due the their child's behaviours which can be violent, abusive and destructive.   Carers may be frightened to take them anywhere out of the ordinary in case the child has a massive meltdown and causes upset to other holiday makers or damage to the property.  Our coaching plans will help you prepare your child for a holiday abroad and our properties will be designed in such a way that even if a child has a violent outburst damage will be minimised.  We won't mind if your child draws on our walls either!  
We will risk assess each Sensory House so that you don't have to.  We will also include additional features such as a lockable cupboard for medications  and at least one door that can be locked so vulnerable items can be kept safe if a child should become destructive.  Each Sensory House will meet the same high Health & Safety standards required for foster homes in the UK.  


If the kids are calm and happy then the parents and carers will be able to enjoy their holiday too.



PRE HOLIDAY COACHING SERVICE


Preparing your child for the journey and the holiday can be the difference between a having a successful holiday or a nightmare one.  To help you have the best holiday you can we will be offering a Pre-Holiday Coaching Service. These have been devised with the help of a social worker and successfully trialed by myself with my daughter who has AD and ASD.  There will be two plans:


 a 1-2-1 coaching plan via email, phone or Skype where I can help you prepare your child for the journey to the airport and the flight itself.

a personalised video plan for when you land in Spain. The videos will be personalised to your child and address any key phobias or triggers such as sudden noises or just fear of going to a new place.  


Both are devised to help you desensitise your child or YP to sights and sounds they will encounter and to introduce them to the places they will visit including the Sensory Holiday House itself.   Our aim is to ensure the children and YP are so  familiar with the things they will experience during their holiday that they won't become distressed - they will be expecting all of it and will be able to tell you what will happen next - this is very important for many children.  

WHAT WE'RE GIVINGWe are investing our time, energy, money and experience to make this dream a reality.  Chris has donated the use of the property free of charge and is helping to modify the house.   I am doing all the promotion, fundraising, design and organising. Family members are helping out doing minor repairs and decorating,  producing the website and donating their time to help make the house ready for visitors.   Most importantly, my foster daughter Kasey will be our chief 'sensory items consultant', testing every item vigorously to ensure they make the grade and will be good enough for our visitors.  



HOW YOU CAN HELP 


We are fortunate to have the use of a large traditional six bedroom village house  but we need your help to transform it into our first Sensory House.  
Your contribution to Sensory House Holidays will help to support the initial costs of  purchasing and installing the sensory equipment and the building modifications needed.   
We need to purchase  sensory items of the highest quality we can afford due to the challenging behaviours some of our children present.   They need to be able to withstand being kicked, punched and thrown!   We will be creating two sensory bedrooms and one main play area in this first house.  
The house is habitable and doesn't need major structural work but is not suitable for what we want to use it for in it's current state.  We need to renovate and modify each room  to make it as safe and robust as possible.   We need to change or alter existing structures and furnishings to minimise the amount of damage a child could cause and to make it safe for them.   
WHAT WE WILL DO WITH THE FUNDING
We need to transform rooms like these:

Aid is flooding into Nepal, but there are several organizations, run by locals, that need your support!   My Name is Rob, I’m coordinating this fundraiser to funnel funds to two great Kathmandu-based businesses that are providing direct relief on the ground. (more on me below) We are supporting two Kathmandu based businesses: 


Smart Paani - a water purification company that will install water purification systems desperately needed around the city.
Himalayan Single Track - A bicycle touring company using Nepali Athletes to deliver aid by bike to hard to reach areas. 

Check out the guys in action: http://ibnlive.in.com/videos/542677/nepal-earth...
   
What We Need & What You Get Every dollar you send will go directly towards helping Nepal.
The more we raise the more we help. We have 2 major goals:

Build water purification systems around the Kathmandu Valley. The Smart Paani Team is currently doing needs assessments. We will update with specifics as soon as we have them. 
Load up Nepali cyclists and get aid to those who need it quickly and efficiently. 

 Let’s help Nepali people to help clean up their own country. Nepali people aren’t helpless victims. If we raise more, we will add additional local organizations to support.  
What you get:

We are working on some great perks to reward you for your help. Feel free to pick one or donate without a perk. 
Want to donate a perk? Email us. 
   The Impact
Who are we helping?

This money will go directly to those in need. 
Stay tuned for updates on the work your donations are doing. 
More info on our partners here: 

Smart Paani: http://smartpaani.com

Smart Paani is a Kathmandu based water systems company. Their team consists of experts in designing water management systems at the household and institutional levels. Their technicians have installed more than 300 systems in Kathmandu. Their management team and advisory board have experts with years of experience with rainwater harvesting, water recycling, and filtration. Clean water will be one of the most urgent needs over the coming weeks to help prevent the spread of disease and keep people healthy. 
Himalayan Single Track: http://himalayansingletrack.com

Himalayan Single Track and the Nepal Cyclists Ride to Rescue (NCRR - see the Facebook Link) are doing something truly innovative. They have mobilized the Nepali National mountain bike team to deliver supplies and aid to the people who need it. They are utilizing local knowledge to coordinate the relief effort and need your help! See them featured here: http://ibnlive.in.com/videos/542677/nepal-earthquake-cyclists-rescue-woman-her-son-from-under-rubble.html

And read their blog here: http://nepalcyclistsridetorescue.blogspot.com/2015/04/ncrr-update-ncrr-are-currently-making.html    Risks & Challenges 
There are a lot of charities out there, why trust us? 
There are a lot of fantastic organizations that are well-vetted and can do a lot of good, by all means give to them if that makes you more comfortable.
But we are partnering with trusted, well established businesses that are well connected and are tuned in to what people on the ground need right now.  
There is always a risk that these funds will be used poorly by those to whom they are given, this is a risk whenever you donate money and we appreciate your trust. 


Who am I?


Robert Burnett - I have been to Nepal 5 times since 2007 as a student, entrepreneur and athlete. My company, Nepali Tea Traders helps local farmers sell their premium tea in the US. If you want to know more about this campaign or have general questions, feel free to email: robertgburnett@gmail.com
I have personal connections with both organizations we will be donating to ad I trust them to put your $ to work in an efficient and effective way. 

   Other Ways You Can Help

<div>       I was sitting back thinking of about how I could reach a goal I set while getting other people involved and having some fun with it at the same time. Then I thought about what would catch my attention, what would make me want to be apart of something. I came up with a few ideas of course but then I thought to myself I’m a little weird so let’s not think about myself in this process. So I went back to the drawing board and I asked myself what is the least amount of money a person could ask me for that I would give without thinking about it and I said to myself $1.00. Ask yourself,How much money do you waste a day? I know I waste at least a dollar a day. Every time someone leaves a light on, or I buy coffee out instead of making it at home, every time i go to the store hungry because I always buy extra stuff or when I give that drunk asking for change money knowing he just going to get something else to get more wasted. I’m just saying we waste money every day. So then I thought what if I setup a campaign to help complete the final planning stage of my new restaurant and I could get 5000 people to give $ 1.00. What if I could start a social media movement and could get 5000 people excited about my restaurant and 5000 possible new customers and visitors to come to Atlanta, Georgia at some point. Then my weirdness kicked it and I said I think it would be fun to set it up as a mystery and unveil clues as we get closer to our goal. Well I did just that. Now I need your help to start this movement. I need everyone to  give just $1.00 and share it on all your social media sites, email it to people tell your people to get with my people and share with their people and so on. You get where I’m going with this. Every person that gives just $1.00 will forever be a corner stone of what I am building. No for real their name will be on a stone in the building. Check out the perks you’ll understand then. Help start a social media firestorm. Let see if we can break the Internet with our clothes on. I need everyone help and support.

<h3><i>Why donate to this campaign?</i></h3>
<p>Starting a business is hard work. It takes diligence, <i>it takes the support of the community</i>, and it also takes capital. I knew all of this. What I didn't know was how much harder it is for women who start a business. My crowdfunding campaign is set up in a way where I am asking <i>less</i> than what I actually need in capital, and with the ultimate goal of raising some funding to go directly into a <i>pay-it-forward fund for other women in business</i>.</p>
<p>""A report from the Institute of Women’s Policy Research (IWPR) shows that women are steadily increasing their presence in the world of small-business ownership... Women business owners still face a significant wage gap and continually have smaller amounts of start-up capital than their male peers... For one, women-owned businesses make only about 25 cents for every dollar their male counterparts earn."" -The Atlantic</p>

<h3><i>What will A Jones Design Co. do with goal funding?</i></h3>
<p>With the capital I receive, A Jones Design Co. will help businesses fill in the gaps of their outreach, by offering a wider suite of branding, marketing, and design services than the current local market. These services should be affordable and accessible to all start-ups, and in one location. I believe in small companies and their positive impact within their communities.

<p>With combined experience in design, marketing, communications, community organizing and advocacy, product development, community and environmental planning, local food systems, and public relations; I am uniquely deft in helping other small businesses with their branding needs.</p>
<p>Helping me, A Jones Design Co., reach my capital and <i>exceed it</i> elevates the community as a whole. The domino effect.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><i>What I Need &amp; What You Get</i></h3>

<p>I decided to crowdfund not only to buffer these costs, but mainly to get out there, be visible, and start offering services right away. Being creative and using that creativity to help others is the whole point! Of course, I chose creative funding. <i>I believe in the power of community!</i></p>
<p>If I do not reach our full funding goal, all rewards and services will still be honored and any funding raised will go towards the original goals as promised. If I can <i>exceed my funding goals</i>, I will pay-it-forward to other women with discounted services to help with that wage gap and lack of capital we have as women in business. <i>I believe in access</i>; all companies should be able to obtain services for their business despite financial difficulties or company size.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><i>The Impact</i></h3>
<p>Again, branding, marketing, and design should be accessible to all businesses. I believe that I can make that happen. With a wide range of services, A Jones Design Co. will be able to fill in gaps in knowledge or just take the weight of marketing off the to-do (someday) list. The returns will have a lasting impact for the clients.</p>
<p>Small business owners can be intimidated by marketing and branding. That impacts their bottom line. It also has a direct consequence on the economy when small businesses do not thrive. ""The 23 million small businesses in America account for 54% of all U.S. sales."" (Forbes, 2014) </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">""Many small business owners are still not adopting modern technology and marketing approaches. Additionally, more than half of SMB owners do not have a website (52%) or even measure the results of their marketing programs (56%)."" Forbes</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">""Only about 1 in 10 small businesses have figured out how to use social media or online advertising to market their product."" Forbes,<i> How Small Business Owners Are Wrecking Their Own Chances Of Success</i></p>
<p>""A new study from Microsoft finds that almost 60 percent of small businesses with websites don’t use any form of paid search marketing, with 9 out of 10 saying they never even tried it. The survey reveals that most small businesses are intimidated by what they believe to be expensive and complex search marketing techniques. Almost 90 percent of respondents feared that keywords were too expensive, with another 25 percent believing it was too complex. Microsoft’s survey found that 72 percent of companies using paid search marketing saw an increase in sales inquiries and 68 percent deemed the technique successful."" (Brafton)</p>
<p>With A Jones Design Co., I will be offering tips and tools in a newsletter for small businesses, and also make sure that costs and fees are low. I will help ease the intimidation factor of using marketing and branding techniques and will strive to educate local businesses on small changes they can make that will have large and lasting positive impacts. </p>

<h3><i>Risks &amp; Challenges</i></h3>
<p>There is no risk in contributing to my campaign for A Jones Design Co. and as I wrote above, all rewards are to be honored regardless of my fundraising outcome.</p>
<p>The risks and challenges for A Jones Design Co. are also minimal. The company will be able to move forward at a slower pace without meeting the crowdfunding goals, though it will admittedly be more challenging to <i>pay-it-forward to the community</i> with discounts and free services right away. I really hope to help other women in business right away.</p>

Starting a business is hard work. It takes diligence, it takes the support of the community, and it also takes capital. I knew all of this. What I didn't know was how much harder it is for women who start a business. My crowdfunding campaign is set up in a way where I am asking less than what I actually need in capital, and with the ultimate goal of raising some funding to go directly into a pay-it-forward fund for other women in business.
""A report from the Institute of Women’s Policy Research (IWPR) shows that women are steadily increasing their presence in the world of small-business ownership... Women business owners still face a significant wage gap and continually have smaller amounts of start-up capital than their male peers... For one, women-owned businesses make only about 25 cents for every dollar their male counterparts earn."" -The Atlantic

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Anjelica Billups.  I am a dual licensed massage therapist and esthetician. Witnessing the health struggles of individuals in my family such as cancer (breast and bone), heart conditions, lack of mobility, and the effect it has on one’s self esteem and overall mind and body led me to form Angelic Touch.  I opened my business 5 years ago. It has become my quest to provide individuals with the needed peace to relax, renew and rejuvenate.  In 2012, Angelic Touch opened its doors in a modest 300 square foot one room studio with little visibility, accessibility and security.  I knew that I wanted Angelic Touch to offer clients a relaxing, and tranquil spa experience through an enticing menu of services and excellent customer service. The tiny studio only allows for me to service one client at a time.  Initially, I started with just 3-4 clients per week, however Angelic Touch services 35-40 clients on average per week.  With this expansion of clientele, I will soon need to hire another esthetician/ massage therapist. It is time for Angelic Touch to spread its wings and fly. </p>
<p>I have been so blessed over the years with my clientele at Angelic Touch. I feel as though my clients have become an extended part of my family. I want to continue to build relationships with them and be able to treat them to a beautiful, relaxing environment that is visible, accessible and comfortable.  I want to expand the service menu to include additional treatments such as makeup application,  result driven facials and body treatments.  Taking the leap from a modest 300 square foot suite to a full space that is 3 times the size is one that requires lots of dedication, love and financial backing. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am looking to raise $7,500 in funding.  This will pay for the opening costs which includes , equipment and supplies.</p>
<p>There are some unique and awesome perks for your help! You can enjoy spa services once relocated and reopened for your assistance in helping the vision become a reality.</p>
<ul><li>Despite whether I reach my goal or not, the relaunch and expansion of Angelic Touch will continue.  I am trying to avoid raising the costs to my customers via price increase in current services.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact of Angelic Touch</h3>
<p>I strive to offer each client a unique and customized luxurious experience. With so many  well-known brands to choose from, clients have unlimited options.  It is my goal to retain and cultivate new relationships with clients. I want each individual to feel comfortable and know that they have someone who cares about their lives, health and well being.  Visiting a spa is more than just pampering ones self, it is about escaping from the  real world if only for 30 minutes to refill ones mind body and soul.  Clients are encourage to leave their cares at the door and to relax, renew and rejuvenate.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I no doubt or fear of the success that the new location can and will bring, however I  am aware that there are challenges I will face. </p>
<p>The obvious challenge is that as the current sole massage therapist/esthetician it will become necessary to hire an employee.  It is imperative that any addition to the staff be well trained and knowledgeable of current trends and advancement in their respective field. They will need to able to provide the same or exceed the current level of customer satisfication.</p>
<p>Another challenge is competition.  With so many  well-known brands to choose from, clients have unlimited options.  It is my goal to retain and cultivate new relationships with clients.</p>
<p>Lastly I have some precise desires and requirements for the new location. I am looking to stay in the Southeast Arlington/Mansfield area so that I may continue to cater to my current clientele. The space must include ample parking and be handicap accessible.  The space must be large enough to accommodate at least 3 treatment rooms and still be affordable. I am looking at several options currently, and I know that the perfect building is not far from my grasp.  The contributions from clientele, friends, family and fans will help widen the possibilities so that I can move quickly and efficiently.</p>

To empower everyone no matter what age, ability or situation to create, repair, be self-sufficient in some way and to make sure our kids could too...Quand tout a commencé...Beh, en vrai on en es pas vraiment sûre... Ça aurai pu être le 1er janvier 2017 quand notre famille s'est engagée dans une année ou on achetait rien de neuf et on a pu découvrir un nouveau ou un monde rempli de bonnes choses qui sont envoyés à la déchetterie... Ça aurai pu être quand mon amie et moi avons commencé à trouver des endroits où faire des ateliers artisanal et avons découvert que c'était très difficile de joindre les deux bouts... Ça aurai pu être quand on s'est dit qu'on était chanceux de pouvoir se contenter et réparer quand les temps étaient durs et peut être que tout le monde ne pouvaient pas faire de même... Ça aurai pu être quand on a déménagé ici avec un bébé de 6 mois et on ne trouvait pas de groupes pour rencontrer des nouveaux gens ou d'activités créatifs à faire avec notre petite... Tout ce que l'on sait est que Ça a commencé dans le but de faire quelquechose, peut être quelque chose petit , mais de faire une difference dans le monde autour de nous. De donner le pouvoir à tout le monde, peu importe l'âge, l'abilité ou la situation, de créer, de réparer, d'être indépendant d'un façon ou d'un autre et de faire en sorte que nos enfants puissent faire la même.  Then...We plucked up the courage, bought the bus and stopped its next destination being landfill. Sticking to our challenge we bought a 1980s green doubledecker that had worked for London Central for nearly 20 years. It had then be repainted for its new life in semi-retirement, before sitting in a garage for years. But with the retirement age increasing, we decided its skills were being wasted and it still had so much to give to a community. Since then, we've been busy transforming the interior to make it fit for a more leisurely purpose, but one full of life. With our 'buy nothing new' mantra fixed in our minds, we have repurposed materials and sought out second hand items. We've even managed to find used solar panels. But soon we will have to stop. There is only so much we can do alone...Puis...On a trouvé le courage, on a acheté le bus et on a fait en sorte qu'il ne finisse pas à la déchetterie. En restant fidèle à notre challenge, on a acheter un bus double étage vert qui date de 1980 et qui a roulé dans le centre de londres pendant 20 ans. Il avait été repeint pour sa nouvelle vie de demi-retraite et ensuite il a été laissé dans un garage pendant des années. Mais avec son âge entrain d'augmenter, on a décidé que ses compétences étaient gaspillaient dans ce garage et qu'il avait encore plein de choses à donner à la communauté. Depuis, nous avons transformé l'intérieur pour le rendre adapté à des loisirs plus tranquilles, mais pleins de vie. Avec notre mantra de ' ne rien acheter neuf ' nous avons recyclé des matériaux et trouvé des objets d'occasion. Nous avons même réussi a trouvé des panneaux solaires d'occasion ! Mais bientôt nous devrions nous arrêter... il y a une limite à ce que nous pouvons faire seuls.And how does the story continue?Well, that's up to YOU! Our aim is to create not just an art, craft and repair space that is accessible to all, but a sustainable, zero waste, SUPER bus.Et comment l'histoire continue?C'est à vous de la continuer! Notre but n'est pas que de créer un espace d'art et de réparation qui est accessible à tous mais un SUPER BUS durable et sans déchets.  www.viamichelin.com   So what happens next? How can we make this idea reality?Well, we've done the research and this is the sketch for next chapter... Alors, qu'est ce que c'est la prochaine étape? Comment on peut faire cette idée un réalité?On a fait les recherches, et voici le plan pour la prochaine chapitre...And the sums?To do this we need at least 8,000 euros: Et les calcules?On a besoin de 8,000 euros (a moins):  We believe that this is the sequel that our lovely bus deserves. We hope you to do. A new life, volunteering in a new guise as Le Bus Vert, still serving the community as all good buses should do, but having fun and inspiring everyone who jumps onboard, including these two...Nous croyons que c'est l'avenir que notre magnifique bus mérite et on espère que vous aussi. Une nouvelle vie en tant que Le Bus Vert, servant à la communauté comme chaque bon bus devrai, mais en s'amusant et en inspirant chaque personne qui monte à bord , incluant c'est deux ...  It will hold:

accessibly priced art, craft and repair workshops


'free studio' time where anyone can use the vast array of materials for any project they choose, on a pay as you can basis

a monthly repair cafe to mend broken items and teach people how to confidently do it for  themselves next time.

plus much, much more

 Il y aura.. 
Des ateliers d'art, d'artisanat et de réparation à des prix accessibles
De temps libre ou tout le monde peut utiliser la vaste gamme de matériaux pour le projet que vous voulez avec un système de payer comme vous le pouvez 
Un café de réparation mensuel pour réparer les objets des gens et leur apprendre comment le faire eux même avec confiance.
Et beaucoup beaucoup plus

<p><u><strong>Summary </strong></u></p>
<p>My name is Jeszika Milton, and with your help I will accomplish my dream of operating a locally sourced farm to table restaurant. As a Chef with over 15 years industry experience, I strive to give customers a 100% homemade menu in a comfortable setting with great customer service; showcasing locally sourced ingredients, beer, and coffee.</p>
<p>Having grown up and completed my culinary studies in Montreal, I had the amazing fortune of working and training with passionate chefs who instilled in me a sense of dedication and pride for real food. I have spent the last 10 years learning in country style kitchens from chefs including Fred Morin, Helena Loureiro, and Karina Lapointe, honing my skills and feeding my fervor of fresh and flavorful fair. Over the past 2 summers I operated a successful market fresh locally sourced food stand at the Fireweed Community Outdoor Market, sourcing all meat and vegetables from Yukon farmers. Farmers and Foragers of Wild will allow me tp turn my food stand into a year round venture.</p>
<p>This campaign isn't just to about funding it's about changing my life.</p>
<p><u><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></u></p>
<p>In the grand scheme of things I need 30,000$ to get my restaurant started. To secure the 30K I need 3000$ in cash equity.</p>
<p>I have found a beautiful location with a fully equipped commercial kitchen. I need to create a dinning room, and provide tables and chairs, as well as dishes for services. </p>
<p>Not only will the funds I am seeking allow me to furnish my location and obtain food and beverage inventory, it will allow me to hire qualified staff and pay them a proper wage.</p>
<p><u><strong>So what's in it for you?</strong></u></p>
<p>It takes a village, and to be part of a village you need to show respect and appreciation.  Everyone who contributes to this campaign will be rewarded for their contribution. In addition to a heartfelt letter of appreciation, you will have the chance to experience a unique culinary experience. Varying level of perks will be offered based on campaign contributions. From free drinks and desserts, to reserved seating on opening night. I will not hold back and showing you that I appreciate my community helping me make this success.</p>
<p>If I fall short of my funding goal, the money I do raise will still serve towards making this business venture a success. </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>As a single mom, striving to spend as much time with my kid while still feeding those around me, this opportunity is a life changer for me. It means I finally get to make food that I am passionate about and create a menu I believe in, on my own terms, on a full time basis. This restaurant will allow me to grow and showcase my passion for country cuisine without having to sacrifice the privilege of time with family, while giving locals and tourists a place to experience true Yukon taste year round.</p>
<p>I have over 10 years of culinary experience both as a chef and waitress, in addition to 7 years of business administration experience. I have a head for business and a passion for food.</p>
<p>This passion extends beyond the kitchen to the butcher shop and the farm.</p>
<p>In my 4 years as a Yukon resident, I have spent 2 summers living and working at a local vegetable and meat farm. I have collected eggs in the morning, and  helped sow and grow vegetable under the midnight sun. I have been fortunate enough to live the farm to table experience. From seeing my dinner graze the field in the morning, to assisting my local butcher prepare it for the kitchen. This isn't just a project for me and my family, it's our way of life.</p>
<p><u><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></u></p>
<p>Owning and operating a restaurant is a major challenge, however I am tackling this head on. The failure rate in the restaurants is 80% in their first 3 years. Knowing this I am not deterred. </p>
<p>Reasons that contribute to restaurant failure in their first years include inexperience, sub-par food quality, spotty customer service, poor accounting skills, and  bad people management. I am fortunate to have experience in customer service, business management, food services, and logistics, and I consider myself very versatile. I am detail and task orientated which gives me the benefit of managing well under the pressure of a fast pace environment of varying energy levels. Being ambitious and driven by a strong work ethic, I took my first cooking job at the age of 13.  My enthusiasm and friendly nature make me a great team leader as well as purveyor of exceptional customer service. My most recent job consisted 3 years as sous-chef and front end manager in a successful locally owned and operated restaurant, and my experience there leaves me confident I have what it takes to make this business venture a success.</p>

<h2>A Juicy Dream</h2>
<p>Hello! My name is Nathalie Sousa, creator of Press &amp;Co., a cold pressed juice + wellness lifestyle company in the making. This business idea was originated when I decided to make conscious and meaningful changes in my life. I began incorporating <strong>juicing </strong>into my daily routine and quickly realized the superpowers of fruits and vegetables.  I firmly believe that what we put in our bodies plays an integral role in how we live our lives. And I am living my best!</p>
<p>I am launching Press &amp; Co. hoping to motivate and inspire people to live a better lifestyle. I am ready to make healthy living accessible, effortless and FUN in the Gulf Shores community and beyond!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518076093/dytdznjsqavmlizo4o8l.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Bringing Press &amp; Co. to life has taken over my days and nights, and it has become the sole object of my dedication. There is so much involved in the making of this business, from education to expensive equipments.  I am so close to making it all happen, but a financial barrier stands in my way. I got to a point where I can no longer hold a full-time job while pursuing this dream. I’m writing to you to humbly ask you to consider supporting me.  Everything is ready to roll, from branding to kitchen space; I even have a few customers and I have already started juicing for them.</p>
<p>With all that being said, I decided to reach out to you in hopes to raise the rest of the money I need to finally open to the public. The community is excited; I have a local business on board to serve as my storefront (a partnership with Foam Coffee &amp; Shop), and also a New Orleans business interested in distributing my juices. There are a lot of things happening right now and I am afraid these opportunities will be missed if I don’t start soon. </p>

<h2>What I Need</h2>
<p>Your advance will go toward the total of $4,000 I need for the rest of the commercial equipment approved by health department, supplies, and also to help pay for some of my bills for one month so I can finally start and focus 100% on it. </p>
<p>I've put everything I have into opening Press &amp; Co., emotionally, physically and financially, but it was a calling and passion I needed to pursue. The success of this campaign is vital to getting Press &amp; Co. off the ground.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your contribution. You have no idea how much it means to me to have your support. I can't wait to start juicing for you all!!!</p>

Our mission has always been to support Virginia Agriculture by building honeybee population and supporting our local farmers. We are the first and only meadery in central Virginia.
We use locally sourced ingredients to produce award-winning meads.
We provide financial support to local charities. In 2018 we worked with Proyecto Agroecologico Campesino (PAC) to support farmers in need in Puerto Rico, the Pink Ink Fund, and the Humane Society of the U.S.
As we approach our 4th year in business it is time to broaden our footprint.
With your support we will:

expand our tasting room in Scott's Addition.
grow our apiaries.
transfer our production operation to work more efficiently and grow into new markets.

Contribute today to help us meet our goal and become part of our hive. We've got some sweet offerings for you.

What We Need & What You Get
Here's how we will use our funding:

60% goes to equipment, construction, and operation of new facility
30% goes to managing existing hives and establishing new ones
10% goes to support of our fundraising efforts and perks

What's in it for you?

Perks are available at different giving levels

</p><p><b>Our Story</b></p>
<p>Jubi is a hibiscus sadariffa juice and ginger juice company
created in 2013 by Marie Nouyrigat in a small workshop in Montreuil
in the suburbs of Paris.
These juices are non-alcoholic thirst-quenching refreshments, to accompanying
meals or as a substitute to soda, but they also have medicinal virtues and have
traditionally been drunk throughout West Africa.</p>
<p>Originally from Burkina Faso,
Marie has lived in France
for 12 years. She inherited these secret juice recipes from her grandmother. A
born businesswoman, before creating Jubi, Marie had already sold her juices in Montreuil at all the
city’s events for the last seven years, creating a faithful clientele before
launching her company.</p>
<p>Now, Jubi is present at festivals, in bars and restaurants
and in gourmet food stores in Paris, throughout France, and
with several small distribution outlets abroad.</p>
<p>Jubi juices are fabricated by hand with organic ingredients
and are in the process of receiving organic certification. The company is
followed by Agro-All in Evreux
 Normandy for the standardization
and stabilization of its products.</p>
<p><b>We need your help!</b></p>
<p>Today, in order to extend its offer and attract larger
juice distributors, Jubi would like to introduce two new products: tamarind
juice and baobab juice, also widely sold throughout West
 Africa. </p>
<p>We have imported from Burkina Faso all of the raw
products to begin fabrication, but our laboratory requires that we do
supplementary analyses.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in order to market our products more easily
and visibly on a local level, we would like to acquire an electric delivery
tricycle like the one in the photo above.</p>
<p>We believe Jubi’s handmade African juices remain a
refreshing healthy alternative to alcohol and soda and would like to remain an
artisanal juice company stable enough to compete in the beverage marketplace.</p>

COFFEE TOWARDS COMMUNITY UPLIFTMENT</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<a href=""https://youtu.be/KZ1cHv23dMw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://youtu.be/KZ1cHv23dMw</a>
</div><div>
<p>We are based in Limpopo Province, South Africa, in the town
of Louis Trichardt. We are surrounded with many social-economic challenges we
want to turn into opportunities for community <b>UPlift</b>. </p>
<p>With the dawn of the café’s centenary year, we have
celebrated the occasion by <b>UPgrading</b>
our 40 seater coffee shop to better serve our community. This has been a
crucial development because the more customers we are able to serve, the more
we are able to donate to our registered NGO partner.</p>
<p><b>UPcafé</b>’s first
priority as a business is to donate 10% of all profits to our registered NPO
partner. The drive behind our equity, ethics and excellence is to first serve
the community through generosity and then fulfill the demands of business. </p>
<p><b>OUR NEED:</b></p>
<p>The first phase of our <b>UPgrades</b>
is completed, which includes: new shop fitting, an improved menu, an expansion
of our take-away services, new apparel for our staff, open wifi and electronic
payment facilities. Your contributions will enable us to:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Complete the second phase of the <b>UPgrade</b> which involves replacing our 10
year old coffee machine with a commercial machine.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Improve the workflow to serve more customers and
better quality coffee.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>UPcafé currently employs four ladies, of which
three are mothers who are the sole breadwinners in their families. Your
generosity will not only help us to obtain a commercial coffee machine but will
also enable one of these mothers to train as a qualified Barista.</p>
<p>If we are able to exceed our campaign goal, the funding will
go towards</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Helping the two other mother’s employed by
UPcafé to obtain proper qualifications in their field of work (Chef/Baking).</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>A baking oven.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Bigger community UPliftment projects.</p>
<p><b>OUR CHALLENGE:</b></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Our current coffee machine delays our entire
workflow and does not cope with the coffee shop demands. Working with a ‘office
coffee station’ is just not the ideal for a café</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>UPcafé funded the first phase of <b>UPgrades </b>and we desperately need to
obtain a commercial machine without compromising our contributions towards
community <b>UPliftment.</b></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>A great looking café is only as good as the
coffee it is able to serve.</p>
<p><b>OUR NPO PARTNER:</b>
() </p>
<p>Our NPO partner has been serving our community for 25 years
and uses our contributions to:</p>
<p>1.  Care
for community members who are in need.</p>
<p>2.  Establish
equality and peace between different cultures and races.</p>
<p>3.  Provide
counseling for vulnerable individuals.</p>
<p>4.  Train
leaders from rural villages in the region.</p>
<p>5.  Establish
a hub from which resources can be distributed responsibly into the community.</p>
<p>6.  Run
<b>UPliftment</b> programs for children and
youth in our community.</p>
<p>7.  Assist
students and rural leaders with obtaining tertiary qualifications.</p>
<p>8.  Offer
support to the elderly.</p>
<p>9.  Run
a community choir that embraces all cultures and races.</p>

OUR VISION: DRINKING
COFFEE TOWARDS COMMUNITY UPLIFTMENT

https://youtu.be/KZ1cHv23dMw

We are based in Limpopo Province, South Africa, in the town
of Louis Trichardt. We are surrounded with many social-economic challenges we
want to turn into opportunities for community UPlift. 
With the dawn of the café’s centenary year, we have
celebrated the occasion by UPgrading
our 40 seater coffee shop to better serve our community. This has been a
crucial development because the more customers we are able to serve, the more
we are able to donate to our registered NGO partner.
UPcafé’s first
priority as a business is to donate 10% of all profits to our registered NPO
partner. The drive behind our equity, ethics and excellence is to first serve
the community through generosity and then fulfill the demands of business. 
OUR NEED:
The first phase of our UPgrades
is completed, which includes: new shop fitting, an improved menu, an expansion
of our take-away services, new apparel for our staff, open wifi and electronic
payment facilities. Your contributions will enable us to:
· 
Complete the second phase of the UPgrade which involves replacing our 10
year old coffee machine with a commercial machine.
· 
Improve the workflow to serve more customers and
better quality coffee.
· 
UPcafé currently employs four ladies, of which
three are mothers who are the sole breadwinners in their families. Your
generosity will not only help us to obtain a commercial coffee machine but will
also enable one of these mothers to train as a qualified Barista.
If we are able to exceed our campaign goal, the funding will
go towards
· 
Helping the two other mother’s employed by
UPcafé to obtain proper qualifications in their field of work (Chef/Baking).
· 
A baking oven.
· 
Bigger community UPliftment projects.
OUR CHALLENGE:
· 
Our current coffee machine delays our entire
workflow and does not cope with the coffee shop demands. Working with a ‘office
coffee station’ is just not the ideal for a café
· 
UPcafé funded the first phase of UPgrades and we desperately need to
obtain a commercial machine without compromising our contributions towards
community UPliftment.
· 
A great looking café is only as good as the
coffee it is able to serve.
OUR NPO PARTNER:
() 
Our NPO partner has been serving our community for 25 years
and uses our contributions to:
1.  Care
for community members who are in need.
2.  Establish
equality and peace between different cultures and races.
3.  Provide
counseling for vulnerable individuals.
4.  Train
leaders from rural villages in the region.
5.  Establish
a hub from which resources can be distributed responsibly into the community.
6.  Run
UPliftment programs for children and
youth in our community.
7.  Assist
students and rural leaders with obtaining tertiary qualifications.
8.  Offer
support to the elderly.
9.  Run
a community choir that embraces all cultures and races.

<b>Handmade
One Of A Kind Pens

</b><p><br/>
You have heard the phrase that the pen is mightier than the sword and when you
think about it, then you see that there is some truth in that statement.</p>
<p>With the stroke of pen people can
start a war and also end it, you can destroy or save the environment with a
pen, you can sign the fate of another person and you can make people happy or unhappy just by the way you use the pen.</p>
<p>
With the stroke of a pen you can fix problems or make them much worse.</p>
<p>As you can see then you can change
everything with the stroke of a pen.</p>
<p>With that in mind I need to do my
best in making my pens, because you never know what decisions are sealed with
that particular pen.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b><span>Introduction </span></b><br/>
<br/>
Hello
and thank you for taking a look at my page on Indiegogo.<br/>
<br/>
My name is Thordur Sigfridsson but everybody knows me by my nickname, Tóti
Sigfrids.</p>
<p>I am Icelandic
and live in Sweden with my wife and two kids, Melissa 10 and Daniel 8. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439241671/ysfifjzarcitzsl07m77.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 431.794px; height: 572px;""/></p>
<p>Melissa and Daniel are also my team mates in this
campaign.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439242311/ifdnn5mp0cls0o5ovbf7.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 432px; height: 324px;""/></p>
<br/>For the last few
years i have been running my own, one man transport company but last year I was
forced on an involuntary retirement due to a severe back problem.

<p>So we had to
make some changes in the household, mainly by switching roles.<br/>
My wife started working and I became the stay at home parent taking care of our kids, <br/></p>
<p></p>


Even though I got the better part of the deal then I really need to do
something else then sit at the computer all day while the kids are at school
and I also want my wife to be able to do something besides working two or more
jobs to support us.

<p>So I had to find
a solution for these two problems.</p>
<p>I have always
loved working with wood and metal so I acquired an old lathe and started making
pens.<br/>
Now I have made quite a few of them and I am in the process of starting my own
pen making business.</p>
<p>And that is why I am turning to you all, in the hope that you will help me make this happen.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>The concept</b></p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p>I will be selling the pens on the internet through my own
webpage but I am also going to sell them on fairs and markets.<br/>
In Sweden there is a long tradition for weekend markets and many of them have
visitors in the tens of thousands every day.<br/>
I am in the process of building a market trailer in which I will have my whole
workshop. The plan is to have it ready next summer and travel between markets
with a “live workshop” where visitors can see the making of a pen.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Funding Goal</b><br/></p>
<p>I am hoping to gather enough funding to get a better lathe
and better tools as well</p>
<p>With your help I hope
to raise 1.000 $ that will be used in the following manners:<br/>
<br/>
500 $ for a new lathe<br/>
150 $ for tools<br/>
100 $ for setting up a homepage<br/>
250 $ for the material and shipments of the pens that are the perks<br/>
<br/>
In the lucky event of exceeding that goal I will publish my stretch goals and
the extra perks to carry on.</p>
<br/>
<p><b>The Pens</b></p>
<p><b></b>In order to craft a superior pen, I
want to use superior materials.  I have therefore in my campaign selected
a handful of pens and the unusual material that make them unique.</p>
<p>Each pen is made of the best available hardware but what makes these pens stand out is the ""wood"" used in them.<br/>It is called ""Acry-woods"" and is made up by blending two completely different elements.<br/>A natural wood called Spalted Hackberry and an acrylic material with a twist.<br/>Part of the acrylics glows in the dark.</p>
<p>How brightly and what portion of the pen glows, is different between each pen.</p>
<p>This campaign is the only time I will offer pens with this material.</p>
<p>They will not be available on my webpage.</p>
<br/>
<p><b>How
I Make the Pens</b></p>
<p>Every pen is handcrafted and no two
pens are the same. Each pen starts out as a block of wood/acrylic material
which is called a pen blank, and a handful of hardware components. </p>
<p>The inside of the pen is lined with
a brass tube that allows for a strong structure .<br/>
To begin the process, a hole must be carefully drilled through the end of the
pen blank. .<br/>
The hole has to be drilled straight through the middle of the blank.<br/>
Once the hole is drilled, then the tube must be glued to the inside of the
hole. <br/></p>
<p>Once the blank has been prepared and the tube inserted, it is then ready to
turn on the lathe. I use wood turning chisels to carefully shape the blank by hand, <br/>
The blank is then sanded using different grits of sandpaper from 120 to 600. I
then put 20 coats of hard finish on the blank, followed by sanding with a set of 6 MicroMesh
pads that sand and polish it all the way to 12,000 grit, giving the blank a
super-smooth surface<br/>
After the finish has been applied and sanded, the blank is removed from the lathe and
assembled with the hardware. The assembled pen is then examined and analyzed to
ensure that it meets all quality standards. If so, the pen is then complete,
and ready to be used!<br/><b></b></p>
<br/><p><b>Perks</b></p>
<p>Following perks are offered as thanks for your support.<br/>All perks are available in all 7 colors.</p>
<p>Each perk will be shipped in a velvet pouch.</p>
<p>All fountain and rollerball pens will be shipped in a wooden pen box like this one</p>

One Of A Kind Pens


You have heard the phrase that the pen is mightier than the sword and when you
think about it, then you see that there is some truth in that statement.
With the stroke of pen people can
start a war and also end it, you can destroy or save the environment with a
pen, you can sign the fate of another person and you can make people happy or unhappy just by the way you use the pen.

With the stroke of a pen you can fix problems or make them much worse.
As you can see then you can change
everything with the stroke of a pen.
With that in mind I need to do my
best in making my pens, because you never know what decisions are sealed with
that particular pen.

Introduction 

Hello
and thank you for taking a look at my page on Indiegogo.

My name is Thordur Sigfridsson but everybody knows me by my nickname, Tóti
Sigfrids.
I am Icelandic
and live in Sweden with my wife and two kids, Melissa 10 and Daniel 8. 


Melissa and Daniel are also my team mates in this
campaign.


For the last few
years i have been running my own, one man transport company but last year I was
forced on an involuntary retirement due to a severe back problem.

So we had to
make some changes in the household, mainly by switching roles.
My wife started working and I became the stay at home parent taking care of our kids, 



Even though I got the better part of the deal then I really need to do
something else then sit at the computer all day while the kids are at school
and I also want my wife to be able to do something besides working two or more
jobs to support us.

So I had to find
a solution for these two problems.
I have always
loved working with wood and metal so I acquired an old lathe and started making
pens.
Now I have made quite a few of them and I am in the process of starting my own
pen making business.
And that is why I am turning to you all, in the hope that you will help me make this happen.

The concept


I will be selling the pens on the internet through my own
webpage but I am also going to sell them on fairs and markets.
In Sweden there is a long tradition for weekend markets and many of them have
visitors in the tens of thousands every day.
I am in the process of building a market trailer in which I will have my whole
workshop. The plan is to have it ready next summer and travel between markets
with a “live workshop” where visitors can see the making of a pen.

Funding Goal
I am hoping to gather enough funding to get a better lathe
and better tools as well
With your help I hope
to raise 1.000 $ that will be used in the following manners:

500 $ for a new lathe
150 $ for tools
100 $ for setting up a homepage
250 $ for the material and shipments of the pens that are the perks

In the lucky event of exceeding that goal I will publish my stretch goals and
the extra perks to carry on.

The Pens
In order to craft a superior pen, I
want to use superior materials.  I have therefore in my campaign selected
a handful of pens and the unusual material that make them unique.
Each pen is made of the best available hardware but what makes these pens stand out is the ""wood"" used in them.It is called ""Acry-woods"" and is made up by blending two completely different elements.A natural wood called Spalted Hackberry and an acrylic material with a twist.Part of the acrylics glows in the dark.
How brightly and what portion of the pen glows, is different between each pen.
This campaign is the only time I will offer pens with this material.
They will not be available on my webpage.

How
I Make the Pens
Every pen is handcrafted and no two
pens are the same. Each pen starts out as a block of wood/acrylic material
which is called a pen blank, and a handful of hardware components. 
The inside of the pen is lined with
a brass tube that allows for a strong structure .
To begin the process, a hole must be carefully drilled through the end of the
pen blank. .
The hole has to be drilled straight through the middle of the blank.
Once the hole is drilled, then the tube must be glued to the inside of the
hole. 
Once the blank has been prepared and the tube inserted, it is then ready to
turn on the lathe. I use wood turning chisels to carefully shape the blank by hand, 
The blank is then sanded using different grits of sandpaper from 120 to 600. I
then put 20 coats of hard finish on the blank, followed by sanding with a set of 6 MicroMesh
pads that sand and polish it all the way to 12,000 grit, giving the blank a
super-smooth surface
After the finish has been applied and sanded, the blank is removed from the lathe and
assembled with the hardware. The assembled pen is then examined and analyzed to
ensure that it meets all quality standards. If so, the pen is then complete,
and ready to be used!
Perks
Following perks are offered as thanks for your support.All perks are available in all 7 colors.
Each perk will be shipped in a velvet pouch.
All fountain and rollerball pens will be shipped in a wooden pen box like this one




As soon as you have made your contribution, I will send you a questionnaire regarding material and color choices.
My campaign has flexible fundings, so all supporter will be receiving their perks

I was born in Ghana, and have lived in Ghana and also in various cities in the US. As you heard in the video, in 2007, my college room-mate Darryl and I sat on the steps of Weld at Harvard University and discussed our various upbringings in inner city Indianapolis for Darryl and in Ghana for me. My father is a doctor and a human rights activist and I had grown up with refugees from the civil wars in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which profoundly shaped my worldview.</p>
<p>Darryl and I were frustrated with charitable models and wanted to figure out sustainable ways to make an impact on the lives of others. We were blown away when we discovered that a billion people globally didn't have clean water. And almost three billion did not have access to safe sanitation. We take clean drinking water and our WCs for granted, but it's crazy when you realize that wow this many people do not have this 'luxury,"" this basic human right. </p>
<p>We co-founded a 501(c)(3) called the African Development Initiative and worked on projects in water and sanitation, microfinance, education and agriculture among others. We decided to focus our efforts exclusively on fighting water and sanitation poverty, starting in Ghana and are now rebranded as CLEANACWA. </p>
<p>Building latrines and working with communities to build and sustain water infrastructure isn't the sexiest work in the world. But we're excited and passionate about it!! </p>
<p>Why? 1)  Because it matters. Too many lives are lost because of lack of access to clean water and sanitation. I've hugged too many mothers who have lost children to diarrhea because of E-coli infested springs. We can solve this. It's not rocket science.</p>
<p>2) Because we are different. We are taking a fresh innovative exciting approach to what has traditionally been a slow moving sector. We don't want to exist in the next 20 years. We are really hoping the challenge will be solved by then and have this crazy ambitious goal: can we achieve 100% coverage by 2025?! We don't care about credit and are only focused on results and outcomes. We are lean and have little overhead. We are completely focused on sustainability and community ownership. We don't just solve water and sanitation problems; we empower communities. We train them on leadership, financial literacy, and give them the tools they need to have ownership of the infrastructure, to maintain it, and to use the human structures in place to catalyze their village's development in other areas. It starts with water and ends with community transformation.</p>
<p>So Why Kili? Kilimanjaro is the highest peak in Africa and the highest free standing mountain in the world! It's a monumental artifact of nature, and represents the giant challenge we face in taking down water and sanitation poverty. Help me take down the mountain and take down water and sanitation poverty! I hope to raise $15,000 for cleanacwa so we can build boreholes in 5 communities in Ayensuano. This is part of a cluster of 120 villages where we are currently working. And it will be so much fun. I've been training last few months and I'm super excited. I hear the views of the Serengeti are mind blowing. I'll share pictures of the climb with all of you :)</p>
<p></p>
<p>I was originally just fundraising for cleanacwa's water projects, but recently in Ghana, the capital Accra experienced record floods that sadly took the lives of over 200 people, most of whom died in a tragic gas explosion leaving many poor homes without breadwinners, kids without parents, really sad. I hope to raise an additional $10,000 in
partnership with Assist Ghana to support relief efforts and to assist the
victims and survivors. I'm typically worried about transparency with relief fundraisers and want to make sure that any monies raised goes directly to the victims. Stories from the Haitian earthquake relief about mismanaged funds saddened me and I'm committed to ensuring this doesn't happen. </p>

Thank you so much for your generous support!! God Bless You!   What We Need & What You Get 
$15,000 will go towards our projects in Ayensuano, specifically to 5 villages for the construction of a borehole to provide clean drinking water.  $10,000 will go to Assist Ghana towards relief efforts. They are keeping receipts, invoices and taking pictures of all donated items. The plan is to deliver care packages to 1,000 victims.

 If we don't reach our goal, we will divide up whatever we raise proportionally between the 2 causes
If you are a US taxpayer, you will get a tax deduction letter from cleanacwa (we are a registered 501(c)(3) based in Massachusetts).    The Impact Clean Water  This will impact an estimated 8,000+ community members in 5 villages The impact of clean water goes beyond diarrhea incidence rates and infant mortality; it also affects gender and education (young girls typically are the ones who fetch water early in the morning and end up missing a lot of class hours as a result) 
Victims of Accra Floods

This will impact 1,000 relief victims

   Risks & Challenges Clean Water  Sustainability of water infrastructure and sanitation / hygiene  cleanacwa always works with the community, local government and local NGOs to create community led committees that are trained in book-keeping, pump maintenance and all the different skills needed to ensure the sustainability of the infrastructure. We take a three-pronged approach to water and sanitation and engage in household latrine construction and intensive hygiene education to complement the provision of water infrastructure. The community invests in every project, no matter how small, so they have a stake and feel ownership. In addition, we monitor each community for up to 5 years post-project completion.

</div></div>","ISSUE 4 - 'A LENS INVERTED - ESSAYS ON GREAT BRITAIN' - has interviews with Taylor Wessing Portrait Prize finalists, a Richard Billingham expose and even words by Will Self. It’s packed. Full of features*. Not quite in boxes yet. Help us get it packed – into boxes – by pre-ordering a copy ---> Richard Billingham - from ""Ray's a Laugh"" Jon Tonks - ""Empire""   ‘I have decided that Matter is dark, brooding, melancholic, interesting, thought-provoking, real, hard-hitting and challenging. I learnt a lot’. (Reader about Essays on the Middle East) MATTER is an independent, biannual publication of 13 academic and photo essays surveying the social reality of conflict and political tension. By concentrating on a region politicised by big media in each issue, we depart from the traditional domain of politics, deconstructing speculative narrative through philosophy, gender studies, contemporary literature, psycho-geography, art and architecture.   Why we need your support: We have decided to go completely advertisement-free for the fourth issue. We are a refreshing voice on current affairs, distinguished by being independent and critical. These qualities sustain our publication and we are not willing to sacrifice them. As we are a not for profit publication, all of the money coming in goes directly to the production of the publication. We are asking you to help us make the fourth Issue ""A Lens Inverted - Essays on Great Britain"" our best one yet. Of the £4,000: £2,800 - will go towards the printing costs£600 - will pay our writers, guest Illustrator and other artists £450 - will go towards funding a venue for the launch of the 4th Issue£150 - will pay our GIF designer Of course, tit-for-tat: we will give you rewards for your donations. Look to the right.  Last year we launched our latest Issue 3 'People Between the Lines - Essays on the Middle East' which featured (among others) well-established journalists from Al-Jazeera and the Telegraph, the bombastic Brendon O'Neill, the award-winning photojournalist Zoriah Miller and investigative journalist Jenny Nordberg. In case you missed it, a few copies are still available to purchase online here. While the ultra-fast tabloid cycles can only afford a slither of airtime before moving onto the next conflict, our aim is to reflect back on political tension with the benefit of hindsight and a critical eye, especially once conflict has dissolved from the eye of the public.   
Our Team:
Robin - graphic designer - Robin dreams about typography, and, as a mini-lawyer in training, in particular which law subjects are most appealing according to their corresponding textbook’s font.
 

 
 
Florien - culture editor - A 21st century female Dionysus. Lover of all things tasty and beautiful.
 

Liv - editor at large - Liv would ideally love to be a perpetual student of the arts and although her favourite author is Beckett, she does laugh occasionally. She's the metaphorical glue to every issue produced so far.

<b>My Motivation</b><ul><li> Over the years, clients and colleagues have approached me looking for a safe, trustworthy place to board their dogs. Extensive Research taught me there are a shortage of good places for dogs to stay, be given freedom to roam and provided with attention and exercise. I've never felt comfortable bringing my own dog to a kennel when I go away.  I realized there was a niche for quality dog boarding, and knew it would be a great fit.  I realized I'd found my calling.  <br/>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>At the same time,  good training for dogs is sometimes reversed when dogs spend too much time away from their owners in kenneled conditions. Likewise, dogs often become despondent and insecure and act out after spending too much time in facilities where they aren't given enough personal treatment. </li></ul>
<ul><li>It's been my dream for a long time to open a board and train to share the love I have for dogs and my innate talent and experience training dogs full time, in a manner that is integral to my life and the life of the dogs. Palm Beach Board and Train will be a safe community where dogs and owners feel comfortable, and a place dogs look forward to coming back to. Owners can rest assured that dogs will be thoroughly taken care of; that we will pay attention to dogs special medication, diet, exercise and behavioral needs.</li></ul>

<p>My sister has tried many means to recover, but unfortunately there has been no suitable or successful methods in Australia.

<h3>What is happening here?</h3>
<p>At first, please understand
that English is not my native language. </p>
<p>So please be aware: </p>
<ul><li>There will be typos.</li></ul>
<p>A couple of years ago my
friend Gero spent some time in Asia for his studies and to visit a part of his
family who’s living in Singapore. Of course he was using this vibrant hub in
Asia to hop in almost every country nearby. It was during these times where he
fell in love with Cambodia and after we met and went back there again: So
did I.</p>
<p>There's something about
this country you can't describe. The wild, the nature, it's heritage and these
awesome people who try to make a living day by day and still manage to stay
unbelievable friendly and optimistic.</p>
<p>On our third visit we made contact with a
French Business Owner who came up with a great idea:</p>
<ul>
<li>Almost everything can grow in
     this country and there's practically no need for any artificial ingredients
     when it comes to agriculture.</li>
<li>Labour is cheap yes, but does
     it have to be unfair? Why not create a healthy business and give everyone
     who supports this idea a fair share?</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other side there was us.<br/>
<br/>
Me, currently a student but former working as a branch manager for one of
Europe biggest cosmetics company and Gero: Not a student anymore but
quite successful when it comes down to business computing.<br/>
<br/>
The moment I tried these Cambodian products I thought to myself:</p>
<ul><li>""You can't find this kind of
     quality and business ethics in our home city. Why aren't we
     funding this""?</li></ul>
<p>So here we go. We already set up a working
business model with our French partners in Cambodia, giving us the opportunity
to introduce their products to the German and later to the European market. </p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>What could you possible sell in Germany that was made in Camobida?</h3>
<p>The answer is quite simple: A lot.</p>
<p>We're planning to sell a wide selection of products beginning from handmade
soaps and SPA products:</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433872988/sewveemhtnwv1ssstrg0.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>over to hand rolled candles, incenses and home
perfumes:</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433873078/szmnjjhhbycfmaiav4xa.jpg"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p><br/>
<p>Everything, including the ingredients, will come from the region around
Seam Reap and is produced organic.</p>
<p>Clothes are another goal. We're already in contact with a French designer
working in the area but we'll have to check the production chain in person
before we make any commitments.</p><br/><h3><span>Why should I support you?</span></h3>
<p>What makes
us different from other companies? A valid question:<br/>
<b><br/>
First: We don’t fake</b><br/>
If we say: ""Handmade"" we don't mean: Well yes, produced in China by a
semiconductor, shipped to eastern Europe by another one, put together somewhere there BY HAND, shipped
back to the stores and suddenly: <br/></p><p>""Handmade"".<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely <b>not</b>! When we say
""Handmade"" we mean it. From production to packaging: Handmade and
every piece thereby one thing: Unique.</p><p><br/>
<b>Second: We won't lie </b><br/>
nowadays you have marketing campaigns worth millions of dollars all over
the internet and TV doing one thing: Trying to touch your soul and/or
conscience to generate particular feelings and bind it to a product. NO matter
at what costs.<br/>
<br/>
Well, we won't. The Cambodian products are awesome and they’re 100% naturally.
The business concept is awesome because everybody involved gets something out
of it. It’s the simple definition of a win-win concept.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Last but not least: It's not about the money</b><br/>
well, of course this campaign is about money. But it's not about making a ton of it by
crowdfunding yet another overhyped tech start-up and trying to sell it to the
highest tenderer. <br/>
It's about building a foundation. For us in the upcoming years and especially
for the people who can be employed in Cambodia on a <b>long term. </b></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433873403/uhrvzzve0fdepw8th4u4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
Nowadays we know that simple foreign aid is<b> not working at all</b>, when it
comes to these long terms. You need to bond between countries and industries. You
need sustainability - not a one-time paycheck.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to change a third world countries situation you have to give the
people living there a steady income that makes it possible to send kids to
school and get food on the table. And this can be done by doing one simple
thing: ""Fair employment"" and a piece of the pie. So every Euro we
make, we also make certain that a fix amount is being transferred back to
Cambodia into the hands of the people living and working there. We do this by calculating their share into our buying price. <br/><p>
How much do we need?</p>
<p>Our goal is to get around
150.000 USD, so we will have to answer probably this one:</p>
<h3>What's the money for?</h3>
<p>1st: Stock
- We need build up a stock with a sufficient product range. The longest
production circle including shipping takes around 3 month. So we need to build
up a sufficient stock for at least four month. </p>
<ul><li>This will cost us around 20.000
     USD</li></ul>
<p>2nd: The Flagship Store</p>
<p>While we want to focus on
B2B and online sales we Germans are a little bit strange when it comes to
businesses without a proper ""real"" shop. So we definitely need to
rent some space in Berlin and build a showroom or let’s call it a Flagship
store </p>
<p>Since you also can't expect
to make any money out of it at least within the first 2 years:</p>
<ul><li>This will cost us around 48.000
     USD for the lease (per year)</li></ul>
<p>And another</p>
<ul><li>5.000 USD for the interior</li></ul>
<p>3rd: Online Sales and
Marketing</p>
<p>We don't want to stop in
Berlin and hang around in one particular area. We're convinced that we're doing
a good thing here and want to establish the product line all over Germany. </p>
<p>So yes, we will have to
spend some money on marketing. Consulting and our online website.</p>
<p>We can save some money
considering the software development of the homepage and so on. But getting the
news out there will costs at least:</p>
<ul><li>15.000 USD for Marketing and PR</li></ul>
<p>And since Germany is the Mecca of bureaucracy:</p>
<ul><li>27.000 USD capital investment
     for founding and financing a ""GMBH"" company that can act as a
     legal person.</li></ul>
<p>However this money is not gone it's simply
bound for creditors.<br/>
<br/>
The rest will be 35.000 - this money will be our cash cushion in case of some
legal works or problems with customs and delivery companies.</p>
<h3>What happens to my money
if you can't make the run?</h3>
<p>What
happens to your money if you can't make it to the 150.000 USD?</p>
<p>Well, if it's under 100.000
USD we will still give it a try and start only with online sells and stands on the city's farmer markets. If we make it to the 100.000 we will take an additional
risk and finance the rest via private loans from friends an family.<br/></p>
<h3>Risks</h3>
<p>The potential risk lies
within the consumer. The products are really good but currently unknown. </p>
<p>Also, many people fall for
false advertisement by major brands when it comes to beauty products.</p>
<p>To minimize that risk we
will set up our business in Berlin which offers:</p>
<ul>
<li>a high educational level</li>
<li>a high density</li>
<li>Critical Consumers (in a good way for us)<br/>
</li>
<li>Start-up City</li>

</div>","What is happening here?
At first, please understand
that English is not my native language. 
So please be aware: 
There will be typos.
A couple of years ago my
friend Gero spent some time in Asia for his studies and to visit a part of his
family who’s living in Singapore. Of course he was using this vibrant hub in
Asia to hop in almost every country nearby. It was during these times where he
fell in love with Cambodia and after we met and went back there again: So
did I.
There's something about
this country you can't describe. The wild, the nature, it's heritage and these
awesome people who try to make a living day by day and still manage to stay
unbelievable friendly and optimistic.
On our third visit we made contact with a
French Business Owner who came up with a great idea:

Almost everything can grow in
     this country and there's practically no need for any artificial ingredients
     when it comes to agriculture.
Labour is cheap yes, but does
     it have to be unfair? Why not create a healthy business and give everyone
     who supports this idea a fair share?

On the other side there was us.

Me, currently a student but former working as a branch manager for one of
Europe biggest cosmetics company and Gero: Not a student anymore but
quite successful when it comes down to business computing.

The moment I tried these Cambodian products I thought to myself:
""You can't find this kind of
     quality and business ethics in our home city. Why aren't we
     funding this""?
So here we go. We already set up a working
business model with our French partners in Cambodia, giving us the opportunity
to introduce their products to the German and later to the European market. What could you possible sell in Germany that was made in Camobida?
The answer is quite simple: A lot.
We're planning to sell a wide selection of products beginning from handmade
soaps and SPA products:over to hand rolled candles, incenses and home
perfumes:
Everything, including the ingredients, will come from the region around
Seam Reap and is produced organic.
Clothes are another goal. We're already in contact with a French designer
working in the area but we'll have to check the production chain in person
before we make any commitments.Why should I support you?
What makes
us different from other companies? A valid question:

First: We don’t fake
If we say: ""Handmade"" we don't mean: Well yes, produced in China by a
semiconductor, shipped to eastern Europe by another one, put together somewhere there BY HAND, shipped
back to the stores and suddenly: ""Handmade"".

Absolutely not! When we say
""Handmade"" we mean it. From production to packaging: Handmade and
every piece thereby one thing: Unique.
Second: We won't lie 
nowadays you have marketing campaigns worth millions of dollars all over
the internet and TV doing one thing: Trying to touch your soul and/or
conscience to generate particular feelings and bind it to a product. NO matter
at what costs.

Well, we won't. The Cambodian products are awesome and they’re 100% naturally.
The business concept is awesome because everybody involved gets something out
of it. It’s the simple definition of a win-win concept.

Last but not least: It's not about the money
well, of course this campaign is about money. But it's not about making a ton of it by
crowdfunding yet another overhyped tech start-up and trying to sell it to the
highest tenderer. 
It's about building a foundation. For us in the upcoming years and especially
for the people who can be employed in Cambodia on a long term. 
Nowadays we know that simple foreign aid is not working at all, when it
comes to these long terms. You need to bond between countries and industries. You
need sustainability - not a one-time paycheck.

If you want to change a third world countries situation you have to give the
people living there a steady income that makes it possible to send kids to
school and get food on the table. And this can be done by doing one simple
thing: ""Fair employment"" and a piece of the pie. So every Euro we
make, we also make certain that a fix amount is being transferred back to
Cambodia into the hands of the people living and working there. We do this by calculating their share into our buying price. 
How much do we need?
Our goal is to get around
150.000 USD, so we will have to answer probably this one:
What's the money for?
1st: Stock
- We need build up a stock with a sufficient product range. The longest
production circle including shipping takes around 3 month. So we need to build
up a sufficient stock for at least four month. 
This will cost us around 20.000
     USD
2nd: The Flagship Store
While we want to focus on
B2B and online sales we Germans are a little bit strange when it comes to
businesses without a proper ""real"" shop. So we definitely need to
rent some space in Berlin and build a showroom or let’s call it a Flagship
store 
Since you also can't expect
to make any money out of it at least within the first 2 years:
This will cost us around 48.000
     USD for the lease (per year)
And another
5.000 USD for the interior
3rd: Online Sales and
Marketing
We don't want to stop in
Berlin and hang around in one particular area. We're convinced that we're doing
a good thing here and want to establish the product line all over Germany. 
So yes, we will have to
spend some money on marketing. Consulting and our online website.
We can save some money
considering the software development of the homepage and so on. But getting the
news out there will costs at least:
15.000 USD for Marketing and PR
And since Germany is the Mecca of bureaucracy:
27.000 USD capital investment
     for founding and financing a ""GMBH"" company that can act as a
     legal person.
However this money is not gone it's simply
bound for creditors.

The rest will be 35.000 - this money will be our cash cushion in case of some
legal works or problems with customs and delivery companies.
What happens to my money
if you can't make the run?
What
happens to your money if you can't make it to the 150.000 USD?
Well, if it's under 100.000
USD we will still give it a try and start only with online sells and stands on the city's farmer markets. If we make it to the 100.000 we will take an additional
risk and finance the rest via private loans from friends an family.
Risks
The potential risk lies
within the consumer. The products are really good but currently unknown. 
Also, many people fall for
false advertisement by major brands when it comes to beauty products.
To minimize that risk we
will set up our business in Berlin which offers:

a high educational level
a high density
Critical Consumers (in a good way for us)

Start-up City
a high demand for ""green
     products""
a high social background with
     the attitude to help or to change within the community

I want to help directly,
how?
Tell people about our idea, travel to Cambodia
and leave the main tourist tracks. 

And please: Don't spent you money in the next NGO you can google up!

<p>Hello, and thank you for taking the time to read about my Indiegogo project. I represent estarbooks.com, an online publisher of classic
Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Speculative Fiction, and Pulp Fiction eBooks. Recently, we
have come to the realization that the market for eBooks of this caliber has
grown, and we are in need of additional staff to help us keep up with the high
demand we’ve begun to experience!</p>
<p>In the past year, there has been a resurgence of interest
with consumers purchasing and downloading our eBooks. We have struggled to keep
up with demand, but have found that our catalog, where you can discover new
authors and rediscover old classics, has been sorely lacking due to our
inability to keep up with our customers. </p>
<p>We are
currently looking to expand our current catalog from 800 eBooks. In order to do
so we are seeking funding to hire a second employee and purchase a second
computer. Having a second employee will allow us to only create more eBooks in
an efficient manner.</p>
<p>There are
so many wonderful books out there that are not currently available we will also
be working to make sure that we continue to expand our current eBook catalog!</p>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>Over the past few years, the popularity of eBooks has only
grown as consumers have realized the important place they hold in today’s
literary market. eBooks are typically less expensive because the costs of
publishing are less than for paperbacks. They are ecologically sound. The

<p>Our eBook
site is unique because it specializes in books in an “alternative” genre. On
most other internet marketplaces, you can find a huge selection of books, but
if you’re only looking for a specific genre, you’ll have a hard time finding
exactly what you need. Maybe you like to read books by brand-new authors, those

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>What We Need and
What You Get:</b></p>
<p>We are looking to reach a funding goal for our expansion
project of $8,000, taking into account the fees and taxes that will need to
come out of our total funding. I have personally looked into a number of
traditional funding options, but we have not been able to find something
suitable for our unique situation. As a very small, online business, we are not
eligible for a loan, and wouldn’t need the high funding amounts that would be
available even at the “low” range. At the same time, we’re at critical mass
when it comes to the work we’re able to accomplish without an additional staff
person. We are simply at a standstill -- we haven’t been able to create more
eBooks, covers, and get them uploaded to websites at the speed we normally
would.</p>

project of $8,000, taking into account the fees and taxes that will need to
come out of our total funding. I have personally looked into a number of
traditional funding options, but we have not been able to find something
suitable for our unique situation. As a very small, online business, we are not
eligible for a loan, and wouldn’t need the high funding amounts that would be
available even at the “low” range. At the same time, we’re at critical mass
when it comes to the work we’re able to accomplish without an additional staff
person. We are simply at a standstill -- we haven’t been able to create more
eBooks, covers, and get them uploaded to websites at the speed we normally
would.


As our work is 99% handled through computers and related
technology, we would also be needing the funding to cover the costs of paying
for additional computer equipment for this additional staff person to use while
working for our business. 





We are also running low on ISBNs for our eBooks, and in
order to get the best price, we have to purchase them in bulk. Your generous
donations would also be used to purchase the ISBNs that we would need to
officially publish the eBooks that come to our site. 
To thank you, our generous backers, we are offering a
number of exciting rewards! These range from a selection of our top eBooks to
eBook reading accessories! Take a moment to review our rewards and select the
donation amount that matches your desired reward, and we’ll send them out as
soon as we reach our funding goal!




Other Ways You Can
Help:
If you can’t make a contribution at this time, there are still
ways you can help. Please take time to share our campaign project with your
friends and family via social media, email, and word of mouth. Your support
could help us reach our goals, and help hire the staff member we need to keep
moving with the current eBook trends!

juvenil” la cifra es del 52,4%. Con este dato que sitúa a España como el país con
más paro juvenil de la Unión Europea. Es bien conocido que ante este drama, los
jóvenes españoles se encuentran con un panorama laboral desolador: pocas
probabilidades de encontrar trabajo en España, plantearse emigrar como hicieron
en su día sus abuelos y antepasados, serios problemas de autoestima,
desesperación de ellos y de sus familias, … . Y eso que estamos ante la

España.</p>
<p><b>UNA SOLUCION BASADA EN LA SOLIDARIDAD</b></p>
<p>Visto lo serio del problema, proponemos una
solución de “urgencias” basada en la solidaridad. En efecto, creemos que lo que
necesitan los jóvenes en paro es un CONTRATO. Así de claro. Lejos de ofrecerles
más formación, más cursos, etc, que lo que hacen es engordar sus currículums (y
finalmente no encontrar un contrato de trabajo), apostamos por dar a un
problema urgente una solución urgente: a jóvenes desempleados ofrecerles un
contrato para que tengan una ocupación retribuida. ¿De dónde vendrá el dinero? De
la solidaridad de las personas, a través de sus donaciones convertiremos ese
dinero en contratos para jóvenes desempleados que nunca tuvieron una
experiencia laboral. Y la buena noticia es que en Solidaridad nuestro país es

en apoyos a familias sin recursos, en bancos de alimentos, apoyos a
inmigrantes,… etc. En fin, España es reconocida por su solidaridad. En esto

<p>Esta solución es una medida de urgencia para

<p><b>My story</b></p>
<p>Seven years ago, I opened Arizona Spice
Company and Arizona Salsa Company here on Main Street in Mesa, Arizona-- without investors, relying only
on resourcefulness, and a favorable response from the community to my all-natural,
gourmet, peppery products. </p>
<p>As a small, local, family-owned business
we are realizing our dream. The business is growing along with our product line which was
created from my own original recipes with passion, originality, and plenty of spicy
peppers. (of course I have mild products too!)</p><p>I have My products in a local gourmet grocery chain, a large warehouse chain, gift shops and specialty stores from Arizona to Canada.  We need to expand locally.</p><p>I am currently working on joining up with a large distributor back east opportunities are endless.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438987263/pjptw0heux7qpyqovwyn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>My personal commitment to quality and flavor earned me the
distinction of being the Official Salsas', seasonings, and Hot Sauces’ of Arizona’s 100-Year

<br/><br/></div>","Arizona Salsa and Spice Company
Needs your help  to become an attraction for tour buses, schools, winter visitors and locals to enjoy.  We want to be a down town destination.  I want to be more than wholesale and retail, I want to be a manufacturing facility where people can see, and learn the process of making food products - sample the product at a salsa bar - and buy the product - all in the same place.  I want to employ more people, support local farmers, and teach the public how my industry works.
My story
Seven years ago, I opened Arizona Spice
Company and Arizona Salsa Company here on Main Street in Mesa, Arizona-- without investors, relying only
on resourcefulness, and a favorable response from the community to my all-natural,
gourmet, peppery products. 
As a small, local, family-owned business
we are realizing our dream. The business is growing along with our product line which was
created from my own original recipes with passion, originality, and plenty of spicy
peppers. (of course I have mild products too!)I have My products in a local gourmet grocery chain, a large warehouse chain, gift shops and specialty stores from Arizona to Canada.  We need to expand locally.I am currently working on joining up with a large distributor back east opportunities are endless.  
My personal commitment to quality and flavor earned me the
distinction of being the Official Salsas', seasonings, and Hot Sauces’ of Arizona’s 100-Year
Centennial.  
I’ve won awards and received accolades for
our product’s flavors in competitions and have been recognized for our unique
products in many publications.   
Things were going well, and then last
year the City of Mesa began major construction on the street directly in front
of my business. The construction continued for ten long months. All the
businesses on the street suffered a huge decline in revenues, many closed. 
This year, the City of Mesa has been
constructing a new Light Rail Line on Main Street, which ends a few miles from my current location. With the street blocked and detours in place during construction, my businesses retail sales are very minimal.   
Still optimistic
Even after enduring another year of
construction and a substantial decrease in business, I was still optimistic
that Light Rail Line would revive the area and get me back on my feet. 
My current location is not the best location for retail or tourists. ALthough they still call, and they still stop by, there just isn't much to see in my current location.  The landlord wants more money to renew my lease.  It doesn't make sense to stay here.  It is my dream to create a place that people of all ages can come and see exactly how food processing works.  I Could guide them through the process as they watch it through glass.  I would promote other local products and products we co-pack for others.
This where I need your help.  Making a move is one thing, creating a destination is more costly.  Me and my crew have a lot of experience in dealing with the public.  So many local agencies, schools, tour buses, and group homes call asking if we give tours.  I want to make this happen.  I cannot do it alone.  With your support we can be a destination.  A facility that can be toured, sampled, and purchased.  But I need extra support to make this dream come true.
The city of Mesa loves my idea. I am working with them on the possible locations that work the best.  They are excited and supportive of this idea.  We need to bring more people to down town and we can be an attraction to help make this happen.  The location of the buildings I am looking at have great street visibility. But I will need
to do some remodeling to reestablish our FDA Certified Kitchen, create a new
production line counter, walk-in cooler and salsas, sauces and spices tasting
bar. I have the plans laid out I just need your help to make it happen.These are the necessary things we must achieve at the new location: Moving expenses for my equipment and
inventory, combined with the added costs of renovations plans, inspections,
permits and expenditures to reestablish our FDA Certified Kitchen is more than
we can afford. I’ve worked long and hard to establish
the Arizona Salsa & Spice Company as a regionally known brand, perhaps not
as famous as the Grand Canyon, but a bit of an iconic name synonymous with
spicy southwest gourmet food products. Being known as the place for “peppery
pleasures” all made with no artificial flavorings, no high fructose corn syrup,
no fillers, no GMO’s and no MSG is something we’re proud of, and want to
continue that distinction and grow our customer base in a great new location.
We are calling on all foodies,
chili-heads and lovers of spicy indulgences, and those who believe in
entrepreneurship, sustainability and small business – to help us.

If you cannot give at the moment, please pass on this fundraising appeal to friends, family and colleagues who may be able to. 
If you are part of a church or community group, please let them know about our work and our fundraising appeal.

<p>My name is Sarah Bencic, I am tall girl from a small town with BIG dreams! I have been a person passionate about helping others for sometime and have been doing so on various scales in many places; anything from making care packages for the homeless in our capitol and knitting scarves for those without, donating of time and resources for those otherwise alone, assisting with community dinners for those who would go without and in more recent times traveling to other parts of the world less fortunate in resources. I have traveled in recent years to help with projects in Kyrgyzstan that would encourage further internal development and make the organizations more self sustaining. On that trip I caught the ""bug"", the earnest desire in my heart to see people helped who would not be otherwise, to stop for the ""one"" in front of me. </p>
<p>This campaign is to assist with just this! I have the beautiful opportunity to go to Mozambique this October and will be leaving on the 2nd to live in the Village of Joy! This is an amazing place that houses orphans and widows, the ones most at risk in their impoverished society. It also is a medical center for the area, where those without means are fed, a sewing school for women who want to make something more for themselves. And most of all it is a place to be loved! In going there for these 3 months I am going to be privileged with the opportunity to help in all of these areas and to love on those lovely treasures! Where I know not everyone is able to drop their life and go to the far corners of our planet, I am entreating your help for me to do just that! <br/></p>
<p>This is a crazy endeavor and am giving up everything of my own means to fund this venture and hopefully more like it in the future. I would appreciate any and all contributions and support to make this dream a reality! Your contributions will be going directly to the costs of getting to Africa and all of the rest to supplies needed to support the ongoing work in Mozambique. Not all of the current goal is for trip expenses, so their is a large budget already to purchase much needed items (for the Village of Joy, and other local people) to take with me, and of course anything over and above the goal will go to that also. Would you help me bless them? Not just with medical supplies, diapers, etc. but also with time? I have always been a firm believer that ""people do not care how much you know, until they know how much you care"" and a lot of that comes from just being with people. It is a very good thing to give to the poor but I think even more so to live with them, to care for them as people. Would you help me do this? <br/></p>
<p> Everyone who donates will receive a Thank -you card from myself, access to regular updates via my recently launched blog (super exciting!),  as well as a newsletter of all that is accomplished during my time in Mozambique upon my return. Every level of donation will have certain other perks attached and will be mailed out promptly once the campaign is over. I am an artist by nature and practice and many of the perks you will notice will be related to art, others are by donation thanks to some fabulously talented friends! But more are to follow with the help of some lovely local donors!<br/></p>
<p>If you are not in a position to donate and would still like to help out you certainly can! You can share this with your friends, family and the world, Indiegogo has made this sharing on all of your social media sites super easy!

<p>But before we go for now a little recap.  During this campaign we entered into a partnership with a local land owner is has made 250 acres available to build a Texas retreat, a deal worth an estimated $1-1.5 million.  We also have just begun discussions with the owner of a Costa Rican hotel with an amazing view over San Jose who really liked what we are trying to do and wanted us to meet to work through the details.  We will be visiting them in mid September to put a deal together to rent out 2 apartments of his for techXscapers.</p>

<h1><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">What Your Contribution Means</span></h1>
<p>We have received overwhelmingly positive feedback about this concept and are excited about making it a reality.  After all who really wants to spend their entire professional life in an oversized box.  However, we want this concept to be driven by the people it will mean the most to.  You.  </p>
<p>The more we raise, the more we can do.  This is why we're here today.  Putting you in the front seat, and empowering you to take back your work/life balance. </p>
<p>Your contribution to the campaign will enable us to perform site selection and secure a lease for the pilot location in Costa Rica.  Additionally, funds will be used for co-working space updates that initially will include: room desk monitors, network related enhancements, dry/erase boards, and portable power for your laptops and electronics.  A small portion of the funds will provide a stipend for the onsite team member who is responsible for site acquisition and site updates.  </p>

<p></p>
<h1><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</span></h1>
<p>While all concepts exploring options abroad incorporate risks, we selected Costa Rica for our pilot site for its natural beauty and strong pro-foreign investment policies.  By leasing our locations before committing to purchase, we have the opportunity to ensure that the property is a good fit for us and an amazing experience for you.</p>
<p>By working through our local connections in Costa Rica, we are confident we will be able to navigate the legal and real estate landscape like professionals.  </p>
<h1><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">A Little About Us</span></h1>
<p>We’re technology professionals just like you, who are also looking for something different.  We are passionate about our work, but want to take back our work/life balance.  So we created techXscapes to realize this dream and we want to share it with all of you.</p>

<h1><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This is Awesome! <span>But I Have Questions!</span></span></h1>
<p>We know you have lots of questions, here are the top questions we have received.  Feel free to contact us if you have more questions at <b>info@techxscapes.com</b>.</p>
<p><b>I have a mortgage/rent payments, how can I afford to go?</b></p>
<blockquote>Rent out your home on Airbnb or HomeAway to cover your costs.  There are restrictions for apartments and condos so make sure to confirm that this option will work for you.  Additionally, it isn't guaranteed that you will be able to cover all the costs of your stay by using these services.  We still recommend that you create a financial cushion just in case.  (Note: because we're a technology focused concept you might be able to get your employer to help out with the costs!)</blockquote>
<p><b>I don’t have a remote job so what do I do?</b></p>
<blockquote>Many employers today already provide the option for their employees to work from home.  If you have demonstrated that you can work well in this environment it is likely that they will be flexible with you to work from our locations.  </blockquote>
<p></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>If I get a Leaf Frog reservation perk does it ever expire?</b></p>
<blockquote>That's a BIG no!  As a Funder, you will receive a confirmation code for your reservation that is good forever.  Use it when the time is right for you.  </blockquote>
<b>What does my rent include?</b>
<blockquote>Included in your payment is:  furnished room, weekly turn down, WiFi, desk and monitor in room, and co-working space access.  </blockquote>
<p><b>Why technology professionals?</b></p>

<h2>Thank you!</h2>
</div></div>","This Week's UpdatesWell yesterday was the end of our campaign and while we did not hit our target we got to meet a lot of great people during the past month who are just as excited about making this a reality as we are.  For our amazing contributors we thank you!  We will be contacting you soon for shipment of your perks.  

But before we go for now a little recap.  During this campaign we entered into a partnership with a local land owner is has made 250 acres available to build a Texas retreat, a deal worth an estimated $1-1.5 million.  We also have just begun discussions with the owner of a Costa Rican hotel with an amazing view over San Jose who really liked what we are trying to do and wanted us to meet to work through the details.  We will be visiting them in mid September to put a deal together to rent out 2 apartments of his for techXscapers.
Some pictures of the East Texas retreat location.A view from across the lake towards the future location of the residences.This is a point of view shot from the anticipated residence lodging.A point of view shot from the future location of the residence & workspace facility. 
Todays Traffic Report:  Seagulls & Turtles.  Perfect!So you're walking down the hall on the way back to your drab cubicle and you serendipitously sneak a peek through your boss's corner office window.  You catch a glimpse of an amazing Spring day.  Where people are hanging out in the local cafe enjoying the sun and fresh air with their laptops out and lattes in hand.Silently cursing your company’s pathetic WiFi, you realize you're trapped inside. That's when reality rears its ugly head.   Trudging back to your cubicle, you think about that amazing vacation you've been planning. You know the one. The vacation you never seem to find the time to take because of the endless stream of deadlines and demands on your time.But that dreamy destination isn't as elusive as you might think.  We can bring it right to your doorstep ... literally ... every ... morning.That's why we created techXscapes.We're talking about tropical beaches, beautiful vistas, outdoor adventures and more.  Where you can work during the day in one of our remote hi-tech tropical resorts, each duly appointed with all sorts of professional goodies like big monitors, fast wifi, dry/erase boards, etc.  Then step outside to enjoy exotic local activities.Because we believe in creating experiences where long-term stays (4+ weeks) are fun, safe, and AFFORDABLE.  Where you can get an 'office' view that would make C-level jealous, yet available at a fraction of the price.  Like ... about the cost of your rent (which is a super deal).Together, we can turn that dream into a reality.So why work from home?  Being located in the Central Time Zone, it's a breeze to continue to work with your teammates.  Carve out your own private or collaborative workspace.  Enjoy an experience where you live, work, and play.  A normal stay at a resort will cost you over $6,000 for a month, we can do a lot better than that!Additionally, techXscapes will offer its residents what we call Growth Tracks.  Our Growth Track services are about enabling you to grow personally as well as professionally.  If you choose to participate in our Growth Track services, you will be able to partake in free and for fee activities and classes.  Our current services include:  

Health & Fitness - Based on BootCamp programs and using the latest in connected fitness technologies you will be able to take control of your fitness and health in a nurturing environment.  


Adventurer - Partnering with vetted local businesses to provide you access to all that the area has to offer.  Ziplining, whitewater rafting, deep sea fishing, nature hikes, and more.  


Cultural - Get to know the host country's history, language, and traditions.  Also for people interested in an expatriate lifestyle, this option provides an excellent way to see if this lifestyle is a good fit for you.  


Entrepreneurship - For the startup minded, we will have activities for learning about what is involved with taking an idea and making it into a reality.   


Software Development - Developers wanting to refresh or expand their skills, we will have bootcamps, hackathons and more to choose from.  


Leadership - For people interested in developing skills for team leadership roles we will have sessions where they can learn the basics.  


Creating the complete vision of techXscapes is an ambitious goal, but one we think will enrich and empower us all.  Ultimately, we believe it will change the way we live and work.  TechXscapes, a mashup of a vacation resort, co-working space, and bootcamp thrown together into a synergistic whole. 
Show Me the Resorts!

Costa Rica's growing tourist market and technology industry makes it an ideal location for techXscapes pilot site and for you too!
While our selection criteria for sites are very stringent, Internet connectivity is at the top of our list.  Providing a combination of resort and condo living experience, you have the freedom to tailor the experience to your budget and preferences. 
Ultimately, any site we choose will be one that we ourselves would love to vacation at.  We're confident you'll love it too.
From Bar Napkins to a Master PlanSo having an idea is great!  Making it a reality a whole lot harder.  We have spent many months refining this concept.  Turning it into something that is lean and mean.  Working through often conflicting requirements, we developed a plan that can be started with only a modest budget.  A plan that will be ready for business in only a few months, not years.  We're sure you have questions!  Below we have included the most frequently asked ones.  However, if you would like to know more about how we are going to execute this concept, please drop us a line at info@techxscapes.com.  We are more then happy to chat with you.How You Can Help


For our generous contributors we have created a list of exciting perks.  Stickers to decorate your laptops.  T-shirts to dazzle your coworkers, and Hula Girl Bobbleheads.   Because they're way cool, and you always need more Bobbleheads.Leaf Frog contributors, can buy discounted rents in 1 and 3 month blocks.  Additionally, Leaf Frog contributors will be the first in line to reside at our Costa Rica location.  Email us if you would like more details at info@techxscapes.com.  We want this to be as fair as possible, but know that site selection will also be dependent on the number of reservations we receive.  If wildly popular, we will get larger and more resorts to meet our demand.  For an extra level of comfort, we will also provide our Leaf Frog contributors our Funding Guarantee.  If we don't hit our funding target you get your money back (Minus the 5% Indiegogo Fees).  So what are you waiting for?  We can't wait for you to join us!
We know that not every hero needs to contribute monetarily.   You can help us by manning the Interwebs and social networks to let everyone know!  This is only the beginning and our plans are ambitious.  
If you or someone you trust has knowledge regarding properties that are a good fit for our concept or interested in creating a partnership with us, please let us know at partnerwith@techxscapes.com. 
Lastly, before you go, leave us a 'Hell Yeah!' on our Comments thread and tell us where your dream location is!

What Your Contribution Means
We have received overwhelmingly positive feedback about this concept and are excited about making it a reality.  After all who really wants to spend their entire professional life in an oversized box.  However, we want this concept to be driven by the people it will mean the most to.  You.  
The more we raise, the more we can do.  This is why we're here today.  Putting you in the front seat, and empowering you to take back your work/life balance. 
Your contribution to the campaign will enable us to perform site selection and secure a lease for the pilot location in Costa Rica.  Additionally, funds will be used for co-working space updates that initially will include: room desk monitors, network related enhancements, dry/erase boards, and portable power for your laptops and electronics.  A small portion of the funds will provide a stipend for the onsite team member who is responsible for site acquisition and site updates.  



Risks & Challenges
While all concepts exploring options abroad incorporate risks, we selected Costa Rica for our pilot site for its natural beauty and strong pro-foreign investment policies.  By leasing our locations before committing to purchase, we have the opportunity to ensure that the property is a good fit for us and an amazing experience for you.
By working through our local connections in Costa Rica, we are confident we will be able to navigate the legal and real estate landscape like professionals.  
A Little About Us
We’re technology professionals just like you, who are also looking for something different.  We are passionate about our work, but want to take back our work/life balance.  So we created techXscapes to realize this dream and we want to share it with all of you.
Pitch & Puzzles

To make this campaign extra exciting we've included puzzle games within our pitch video.  So dust off your Thinking Cap and join us in the video hunts!  
Tune in to our Updates thread for announcements every Wednesday at 8pm CST during our campaign!  Prizes include perks, props from our pitch video and more! 
This is Awesome! But I Have Questions!
We know you have lots of questions, here are the top questions we have received.  Feel free to contact us if you have more questions at info@techxscapes.com.
I have a mortgage/rent payments, how can I afford to go?
Rent out your home on Airbnb or HomeAway to cover your costs.  There are restrictions for apartments and condos so make sure to confirm that this option will work for you.  Additionally, it isn't guaranteed that you will be able to cover all the costs of your stay by using these services.  We still recommend that you create a financial cushion just in case.  (Note: because we're a technology focused concept you might be able to get your employer to help out with the costs!)
I don’t have a remote job so what do I do?
Many employers today already provide the option for their employees to work from home.  If you have demonstrated that you can work well in this environment it is likely that they will be flexible with you to work from our locations.  

If I get a Leaf Frog reservation perk does it ever expire?
That's a BIG no!  As a Funder, you will receive a confirmation code for your reservation that is good forever.  Use it when the time is right for you.  
What does my rent include?
Included in your payment is:  furnished room, weekly turn down, WiFi, desk and monitor in room, and co-working space access.  
Why technology professionals?
Being technology professionals ourselves we wanted to create something that we have a lot of experience with and know what your needs are.  However, that being said we don't have any visitor restrictions.  Just keep in mind that this environment is made to be conducive to technology professionals.
Do I need a work visa?
For Costa Rica stays lasting longer than 90 days you will require a visa.  Work visas are available to professionals and we will be there to help you get one should you stay for longer than 90 days.
How does this affect my taxes?
This is highly dependent on your personal tax situation and we are alas not tax professionals.  However, depending on the length of stay, (greater than 12 months) you may not have to pay US taxes.  But again, we recommend you talk to a professional about this.
Accidents happen, how does health care work there?
Availability of quality healthcare is one of the top concerns of our site selection criteria.  That being said you will need to check with your current provider’s options for out of network costs.  However, coverage for long term residents can be purchased at reasonable prices.
I have a family can they join me?
While we ultimately plan to provide accommodations for the whole family, initially we can only accommodate you and your partner.  
My pets are family to me, can I bring them too?
We’re animal people too and host countries that allow for easy access of our four paw furries is a must!  However, in the beginning we will not be able to host your pets.  But we will definitely announce when you can bring them with you!
I’m curious about this concept but can I rent for shorter terms?
Absolutely!  However, these bookings will be at standard resort pricing rates and depend on current availability.

It sounds like a blast, but how will I get any work done?
While we want you to have a memorable experience, we also know you have a job to do.  To help with distractions, we will minimize extra curricular activities during typical US working hours.  And with our private and collaborative spaces, you have the flexibility to carve out your own ideal place to work.
How is this different from Corporate Housing or Extended Stays?
Corporate Housing and Extended Stays provide many of the basic features of techXscapes in terms of stay length options and room amenities.  However, they are focused on locations in cities and are more about being large multi-unit apartments than on providing boutique resort like experiences.  Additionally, we provide you with collaborative workspace options as well as our growth tracks tailored to your interests.

increases their vulnerability to depression and mental health issues. Mobility

<p>Action for Elders is a charity that was registered in 2012 with the key objective of tackling the major challenges of our ageing society. We deliver a number of programmes that enhance the well-being of older people, bringing respect, dignity, confidence and purpose into their lives – and helping those who wish to live with as much independence as possible.The programmes have a profound impact not only on the older people who take part, but on their whole family and local community.</p><p>In 2013, ITV produced a short film on our work which resulted in the charity winning the Public Vote in 'People's Millions' and being awarded £50k.  You can watch the video <a href=""https://vimeo.com/80476719"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">As Dr Malcolm Fisk, Co-Director

</blockquote><br/><p></p></div>","Fact: Loneliness kills (many recent
studies suggest that it could be the next big public-health issue, on a par with
obesity)
Fact: Severe loneliness just in England
blights the lives of 700,000 men and 1.1m women over 50, and is rising with
astonishing speed1
Fact: Social Isolation is the number one
reason for the rapid deterioration of mental health in older people

John is 85 years of age and lives alone.  He didn't see another person yesterday. It will be the same today. It will be the same tomorrow.  He is lonely, depressed and in increasingly poor health. 
In one sense, John is not alone because 49% of people aged 75 or over live alone (ONS 2012).  In the most important sense, however, he is alone. 
We want to make later life so much better for John and many older people like him.  We want to do this today, so that he can get the most out of the rest of his
tomorrows...  Balanced Lives beats loneliness
Action for Elders has created a Balanced Lives
programme that addresses both of these definitions of balance. How? Well, the
programme helps older people with both mobility and mental wellbeing.
We are already helping hundreds of
older people with our Balanced Lives programmes and we want to help many
more.  The goal of our campaign
is to secure funding for 2015 Balanced Lives classes this year. 
Many older people are
trapped in their own homes by a lack of mobility and the loss of family and
friends.  This lack of social interaction
increases their vulnerability to depression and mental health issues. Mobility
and mental health are the two major challenges to the quality of life in older
age and our approach tackles these two factors head-on and recognizes the
linkages between the two.
We need your help to raise £40,300
to offer 2015 older people a Balanced Lives Class this year.
With an increasing
number of older people facing a future of paying for their own care and support
services, or perhaps avoiding these if they feel they cannot afford them, then loneliness
may become an even bigger issue.  
We
can’t let this happen;
together we can show older people that they are valued. Show your support
today.

Why this campaign? : Our Impact

We developed the Balanced Lives Programme in partnership with
Sheffield University and have evidence that this model improves the lives of
older people. Since 2006, we’ve run 30 programes in 8 places across the UK and
helped 535 older people feel more
valued and less isolated....
 

On the “keeping in touch” arm of the Older People’s Outcome Star (which measures isolation), the evaluation found that participants moved from an average score of 7.6 (out of 10) at the first assessment, to 8.1 on review.  
 Evidence
also shows that there was a measured marked improvement in social interaction
of 16% for those who have been involved with our programmes. Life is for living, no matter how old you are. Together, we can make this happen.
About
Action for Elders
 

Action for Elders is a charity that was registered in 2012 with the key objective of tackling the major challenges of our ageing society. We deliver a number of programmes that enhance the well-being of older people, bringing respect, dignity, confidence and purpose into their lives – and helping those who wish to live with as much independence as possible.The programmes have a profound impact not only on the older people who take part, but on their whole family and local community.In 2013, ITV produced a short film on our work which resulted in the charity winning the Public Vote in 'People's Millions' and being awarded £50k.  You can watch the video here.As Dr Malcolm Fisk, Co-Director
Ageing Society, Coventry University so succinctly put it “you have got something that is really, really good here, but now need
the resources to deliver it.” With your
help, we can make this happen.
How we make real, lasting change
To effect real change
in the health of older people then short term solutions do not work (Cochrane
Review 2009, Big Lottery Well Being Report 2013). Indeed when you are dealing
with Social Isolation and Loneliness then our programme becomes a lifeline to
those who attend, building on an individual’s confidence and sense of security.
To ensure we make real, lasting change:
·  

# We look for the most isolated communities across the UK
# Our programmes are the result of sound academic research and are constantly evolving to meet the individual needs of older people·  
# Everything we do is evidence based 
# We address some of the most challenging issues facing our ageing society
# We’ve already worked in collaboration with Sheffield University, My Home Life, Elderly Accomodation Council, Care
& Repair, Public Health Wales

<p>Hello! I
am Emmy Callero and I am an interior designer with an unstoppable passion for
design and Andean textiles.  </p>
<h4>I've been in love with Latin
America and textiles since I was a child.  I lived in Peru in my

The Problem
The majority of fair trade ventures fail within the first three years.  They try to sell multiple products and aim to make impact in multiple villages concurrently.  It's a lose-lose situation.  The ventures in the US fail and the artisans do not receive consistent and sustainable work. 
The Solution 


The
solution is to narrow the scope to one community, focus on one product at a
time, grow relationships and generate sustainable revenue.   
The Plan 
I am
collaborating with two weaving communities in the Andes that are supported by
Threads of Peru, a fair trade certified organization.  Saying that these
women are skilled artisans is an understatement.  These women are masters
of their craft, and ancient craft that spans millennia.  We are collaborating on textile designs that

These communities are isolated and
these women are living in extreme poverty. They live a subsistence lifestyle
with little attention from the outside world.  Life is lived close to the
edge in the beautiful yet unforgiving Andes.  
My goal is simple: Provide
consistent work for these women. 
What does consistent work give? Financial security so they can confidently ride the waves of uncertainty.





What We Need 
 This funding will help us in three ways. 



1)  $6000 will fund
the purchase of 50 textiles which will provide direct income to the women
workers for a whole year.
2)  $2000 will
fund my trip to Peru to meet the artisans face to face in August. 
3)  $1000 will further develop my business
with the purchase of a high quality camera and Adobe Creative Suite software. 

    What Will I Do with the Textiles? 


I have an online store! Did you know that?

I
will sell the textiles on my online store. 
I
have interested buyers in three (and counting) boutique shops in Portland,
Oregon.
What
does it mean if I sell all 50 textiles? I can buy 50 more, continue this
pattern, and transform the community with sustaining work.  


    Other Ways You Can Help You can help by making some noise! 
Share this campaign with 5 people and ask them to share with 5 others. I truly believe together we can make an impact in the Andes and give women work.
You can also buy a textile when they arrive!

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p>If you don't already know someone whose life is impacted by an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis, chances are you will soon. The CDC estimates that 1 in every 68 children have already been diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder, and that number continues to rise at an alarming rate every year. While the cause of the escalating diagnoses remains unclear, what is apparent is that a growing percentage of our population has increasingly complex sensory and social issues that never go away.  </p>
<p><b>What does it mean to have sensory and social issues?</b></p>Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that impacts typical activities, such as socialization, and is often characterized by displays of repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior. Individuals with a spectrum disorder usually display different responses to sensory experiences when compared to typically developing peers. For example, they may find the noise of a baseball game or a crowd too loud and overstimulating, or fluorescent lighting distracting and painful. While the spectrum of autism is varied and differs with each person, individuals with autism – as well as those with other developmental disabilities – usually have a dysfunctional sensory system where one or more senses are either over- or under-reactive to stimulation. <p></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p><b>Why should I support this park?</b></p>
<p>This is a park designed with the needs of our local community in mind. We want the general public to get excited about this new addition and the positive change it will bring to our communities! </p>
<p><b>What makes this park different?</b></p>The Sensory Park and Playground, the first of its kind in the nation, was developed in conjunction with national experts in the creation of living and recreational spaces for individuals with disabilities. The park features seven elements of inclusive play (please see below) that will make this a friendly play space for children with ASD diagnoses and their 'neurotypical' peers. <p></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p><b>Where will the park be located?</b></p>The Sensory Park &amp; Playground will be located on over an acre of Glade Run’s Zelienople campus with easy access to interstate 79 and the Pennsylvania Turnpike.<p></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p><b>Who will get to use the park?</b></p>
<p>Everyone! While this park was designed to specifically meet the needs of kids with autism, it will be FREE and open to the general public and able to be used by all children. </p>
<br/><p></p>
<p></p>

<p>The Sensory Park
and Playground includes several essential elements for inclusive play:</p>
<p>1.<span>  </span>Bolting can be
an issue for children with autism, so a perimeter fence with only one or two
ways in and out help to maintain security and safety. The perimeter fence is
being constructed with materials salvaged from the deconstruction of historic
agency building to preserve aspects of the agency’s history during the
transformation.</p>
<p>2.<span>  </span>Vast,
unorganized spaces make it difficult for some children to engage in activities.
Clear way-finding and delineation of activity zones are essential to the
development of the park, and reduce the stress of children as well as their parents.
The shape of the play spaces will be ovals, which are comfortable and natural
shapes for children on the autism spectrum to move within.</p>
<p>3.<span>  </span>Overstimulation
is often a barrier to children with autism spending time outdoors. Nature can
set a serene tone and calm children, so soothing and safe areas are included in
the design. Paths and landscaping allow for separation between activities. Cozy
spaces for retreat and de-escalation are provided as well as areas to observe
activities from a distance before engaging physically in play. </p>
<p>4.<span>  </span>Sensory elements
are key to the creation of this unique sensory play area. Children with autism
have over- or under-responsive sensory systems. Providing various sensory
elements in the park can both soothe and stimulate children. Examples of
elements include auditory (chimes, music), visual (movement, muted colors),
scent (flowers, grass. plants) and touch (water, textured surfaces). Ample
space for running and exercise is vital for all children. </p>
<p>5.<span>  </span>Play should
increase motor skills, coordination, balance, and movement. Activities in the
park enhance body awareness and motion. Physical elements include equipment
that spins, slides, swings, and bounces. Opportunities for rocking, climbing,
crawling, balancing, jumping, walking and running are also incorporated through
the park’s design and equipment. </p>
<p>6.<span>  </span>Opportunity for
social skills development in the park provide children with autism spectrum
disorders a venue for engaging and interacting with other children while also
providing space for individualized play. Many pieces on the playground require
more than one person to operate, sparking social interaction.</p>
<p>7.<span>  </span>Finally, the
park will include amenities that make it comfortable and pleasant for both
children and families, including shelters, restrooms, covered and open picnic
areas, benches, paths and hardscapes, efficient lighting, and landscaping.</p>

through a residential treatment facility and through K-12 education at St.
Stephen’s Academy – our licensed private school.  Glade Run also offers community based
services through offices located in Butler, Beaver Falls, Cranberry and
Pittsburgh. Programs include wraparound services for children with autism as
well as individual and family mental health and partnership programs. Through
community based services, families are kept together, and children are able to
begin the process of healing by learning how to use their unique strengths to
lead productive lives in their own homes and communities. Additional

</div></div>","Why should I care about autism?
If you don't already know someone whose life is impacted by an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis, chances are you will soon. The CDC estimates that 1 in every 68 children have already been diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder, and that number continues to rise at an alarming rate every year. While the cause of the escalating diagnoses remains unclear, what is apparent is that a growing percentage of our population has increasingly complex sensory and social issues that never go away.  
What does it mean to have sensory and social issues?Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that impacts typical activities, such as socialization, and is often characterized by displays of repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior. Individuals with a spectrum disorder usually display different responses to sensory experiences when compared to typically developing peers. For example, they may find the noise of a baseball game or a crowd too loud and overstimulating, or fluorescent lighting distracting and painful. While the spectrum of autism is varied and differs with each person, individuals with autism – as well as those with other developmental disabilities – usually have a dysfunctional sensory system where one or more senses are either over- or under-reactive to stimulation. 
Why should I support this park?
This is a park designed with the needs of our local community in mind. We want the general public to get excited about this new addition and the positive change it will bring to our communities! 
What makes this park different?The Sensory Park and Playground, the first of its kind in the nation, was developed in conjunction with national experts in the creation of living and recreational spaces for individuals with disabilities. The park features seven elements of inclusive play (please see below) that will make this a friendly play space for children with ASD diagnoses and their 'neurotypical' peers. 
Where will the park be located?The Sensory Park & Playground will be located on over an acre of Glade Run’s Zelienople campus with easy access to interstate 79 and the Pennsylvania Turnpike.
Who will get to use the park?
Everyone! While this park was designed to specifically meet the needs of kids with autism, it will be FREE and open to the general public and able to be used by all children. 






The Sensory Park
and Playground includes several essential elements for inclusive play:
1.  Bolting can be
an issue for children with autism, so a perimeter fence with only one or two
ways in and out help to maintain security and safety. The perimeter fence is
being constructed with materials salvaged from the deconstruction of historic
agency building to preserve aspects of the agency’s history during the
transformation.
2.  Vast,
unorganized spaces make it difficult for some children to engage in activities.
Clear way-finding and delineation of activity zones are essential to the
development of the park, and reduce the stress of children as well as their parents.
The shape of the play spaces will be ovals, which are comfortable and natural
shapes for children on the autism spectrum to move within.
3.  Overstimulation
is often a barrier to children with autism spending time outdoors. Nature can
set a serene tone and calm children, so soothing and safe areas are included in
the design. Paths and landscaping allow for separation between activities. Cozy
spaces for retreat and de-escalation are provided as well as areas to observe
activities from a distance before engaging physically in play. 
4.  Sensory elements
are key to the creation of this unique sensory play area. Children with autism
have over- or under-responsive sensory systems. Providing various sensory
elements in the park can both soothe and stimulate children. Examples of
elements include auditory (chimes, music), visual (movement, muted colors),
scent (flowers, grass. plants) and touch (water, textured surfaces). Ample
space for running and exercise is vital for all children. 
5.  Play should
increase motor skills, coordination, balance, and movement. Activities in the
park enhance body awareness and motion. Physical elements include equipment
that spins, slides, swings, and bounces. Opportunities for rocking, climbing,
crawling, balancing, jumping, walking and running are also incorporated through
the park’s design and equipment. 
6.  Opportunity for
social skills development in the park provide children with autism spectrum
disorders a venue for engaging and interacting with other children while also
providing space for individualized play. Many pieces on the playground require
more than one person to operate, sparking social interaction.
7.  Finally, the
park will include amenities that make it comfortable and pleasant for both
children and families, including shelters, restrooms, covered and open picnic
areas, benches, paths and hardscapes, efficient lighting, and landscaping.





Founded
in 1854 as the Orphan’s Home and Farm School, today Glade Run serves thousands
of traumatized youth through educational, mental health, cultural and autism
programs in residential school and community settings. Glade Run employs over
550 dedicated professionals to care for over 4,000 unduplicated individuals
each year. Over 70% of individuals we serve are youth under age 21, and are
referred for services from over 43 counties and 50 school districts across
Western Pennsylvania.


Our
mission – linking faith and service – epitomizes our dedication to serving
those upon which others have given up. Glade Run was created to serve vulnerable
children and families in need with programs and services that succeed where
others have failed. Our goal is to provide critical and strategic service to
the community through exceptional quality programs for traumatized children and
families in a safe environment. 
On our historic 331-acre
campus located in Zelienople, PA, Glade Run serves children ages 6 to 21
through a residential treatment facility and through K-12 education at St.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>Irrational optimism is the fuel and the pursuit of a passion is the fire. All he needs now is some community support to launch his ambition off the ground. A mobile car wash may not be the most glamourus endeavor, but its the satisfaction he obtains when working precious metals in to beautiful works of art.</p>
<p>His enthusiasm for the car wash business began as a hobby, way back in 2004, where he would take great pride in shining cars for friends and family. After years of trying to find his niche he eventually came to the realization that getting paid for something you enjoy should be the ultimate goal. So for the past two years he has been patiently, yet fervently,  pursuing this passion which is now coming into fruition.</p>
<p>He has managed to bootstrap himself into the business with branding and marketing assistance from local friends and family. Unfortunately, he is still missing a few key pieces to becoming a fully operable business (Listed Below).</p> <ul> <li>
<b>Enclosed Trailer</b> $3,500.00</li> <li>
<b>Dual Action Polisher</b> $350.00</li> <li>
<b>Logo Laminate for Trailer</b> $500.00</li> </ul> <p>The true goal is to get $3,500.00 to purchase the ""Enclosed Trailer"". Everything else would be a bonus. He is currently hauling his equipment around in a 1996 Ford Explorer with very limited capacity (See Images).</p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Once the financial goals are achieved he plans on further optimizing the business. The vision is to ""Go Green"" and become an environmentally friendly car wash. With our impending water shortages in California he plans on mitigating this problem by adopting methods to conserve water by operating a water collection and filtration system.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Water Containment Mat &amp; Water Reclamation System</b> $599.99</li>
</ul>
<div>The water containment mat is the best solution for complying with water runoff regulations.

<div style=""text-align: center;""><b>""Find your passion and figure out how to get paid for it.""</b></div>
</div></div>","Short Summary Irrational optimism is the fuel and the pursuit of a passion is the fire. All he needs now is some community support to launch his ambition off the ground. A mobile car wash may not be the most glamourus endeavor, but its the satisfaction he obtains when working precious metals in to beautiful works of art.
His enthusiasm for the car wash business began as a hobby, way back in 2004, where he would take great pride in shining cars for friends and family. After years of trying to find his niche he eventually came to the realization that getting paid for something you enjoy should be the ultimate goal. So for the past two years he has been patiently, yet fervently,  pursuing this passion which is now coming into fruition.
He has managed to bootstrap himself into the business with branding and marketing assistance from local friends and family. Unfortunately, he is still missing a few key pieces to becoming a fully operable business (Listed Below).  
Enclosed Trailer $3,500.00 
Dual Action Polisher $350.00 
Logo Laminate for Trailer $500.00  The true goal is to get $3,500.00 to purchase the ""Enclosed Trailer"". Everything else would be a bonus. He is currently hauling his equipment around in a 1996 Ford Explorer with very limited capacity (See Images).
  The Impact Once the financial goals are achieved he plans on further optimizing the business. The vision is to ""Go Green"" and become an environmentally friendly car wash. With our impending water shortages in California he plans on mitigating this problem by adopting methods to conserve water by operating a water collection and filtration system.


Water Containment Mat & Water Reclamation System $599.99

The water containment mat is the best solution for complying with water runoff regulations. EPA mandates and local laws often require containment and disposal of water runoff to prevent fouling of natural water resources and environmental contamination.   Risks & Challenges The risk is minimal, and the challenge is great, but this endeavor is not out of reach. He is currently gathering support from locals in his community via word of mouth and business opportunities. So whether or not he gets the contributions he needs it will only be a matter of time before he hustles his way to success.   Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:  Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about this campaign. Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!
If you know somebody, that knows somebody, that knows something about it, let them know.

so badly to change and be a good mother, but at 26 found herself unable to
escape the lifestyle. With tears and hope Lisa signed over her rights to be Hannah’s
mother.  Then Lisa got completely clean,
became an RN and a productive member of society.  Haunted with guilt and
loss, Lisa had to “pay it forward”.  Remembering life on the street made Lisa
grow passionate about extending her heart and her hand to the homeless which she
did for 6 years.  Then in 2012, Lisa Trunzo turned her passion into a legacy
by legally becoming a non-profit corporation entitled: HANNAH’S HOMELESS, INC.</span></p>

<p><br/></p>So we aren't in this thing to ""end

and they walk taller, smell better, feel like human beings again. And there are
some we've helped, supported and cheered while they struggled to get on track.
Just look through our Facebook page! We post these as much as possible, to show
how proud we are of the client who put in the hard work to climb out of a hole.

The reality is that to those we can and do help, it’s worth every bit of it!!

</div></div>","Short Summary





Lisa lived on and off the streets of St. Pete for many years. Homeless, drug addicted, and pregnant’ Lisa wanted
so badly to change and be a good mother, but at 26 found herself unable to
escape the lifestyle. With tears and hope Lisa signed over her rights to be Hannah’s
mother.  Then Lisa got completely clean,
became an RN and a productive member of society.  Haunted with guilt and
loss, Lisa had to “pay it forward”.  Remembering life on the street made Lisa
grow passionate about extending her heart and her hand to the homeless which she
did for 6 years.  Then in 2012, Lisa Trunzo turned her passion into a legacy
by legally becoming a non-profit corporation entitled: HANNAH’S HOMELESS, INC.

  What We Need & What You Get 
“Each one of us can make a difference.  Together, we can make a change.” ~ Barbara Mikulski
We need you! 0k, our goal is to garner enough continued support through individual, corporate, and community donors like you to help us cushion the rising costs of daily operations so that we can continue to plant seeds of hope and propel Hannah’s Homeless towards our vision of full service operation with “grassroots” fundamentals.
With continued support from individual, corporate, and community donors, we will enable Hannah’s Homeless to expand our capabilities to include full access to medical care, shower stalls, and even transportation options.  
Please join us, invest in the members of our community who have fallen in a hole because “No one dreams of being dirty, of having no
pillow, scavenging for food, having no clean clothes, or even having to fend
for their life everyday”.Homelessness is real.  It could
even happen to YOU, I know, it happened to me. 
By reaching in your pocket, Hannah’s Homeless would be available if it
did happen to you!    The Impact


Currently, we are serving close to 500 clients in-house monthly, as well as offering several “dignity events”, such as our annual Christmas In The Park and 2nd Chance Make-over Days.  Although the number of clients has increased by about 300% since opening our new location earlier this year, the smiles, hugs, and gratitude we receive from our clients is our true measure of success.  Hearing success stories from clients who have gone on to find work, shelter, and more importantly, the dignity they lost somewhere along the way, warms our hearts and lifts our spirits.  Seeing their transformations only further reaffirms that, though we’re still small, we are making a difference and it’s that difference that makes all of this worth it!   









RISKS & CHALLENGES


Of the 5887 people Pinellas County counted as homeless in 2014, 252 were victims of domestic abuse, 572 were diagnosed with having a physical or developmental disability, and 1 out of 10 were veterans.
As many of us have probably known the reality of being a single paycheck away from homelessness ourselves, homelessness will always exist.  Showing no bias, the reasons for homelessness vary, but the fact remains, Every single one of us has faced variations of adversity at some point in our lives. The difference is that while most of us here have the support of friends and family, access to critical resources, or other means necessary to work through the adversities, many of the members of our homeless community do not. 
Being the only resource center in Pinellas County of its kind, the biggest challenge is the potential to not be able to generate the funding necessary to remain a free alternative provider to those within our community that need it the most….

So we aren't in this thing to ""end
homelessness"" but instead to plant seeds of hope, to offer up some dignity
and self-respect by treating these folks that society shuns with open arms and bear
hugs. We do make over days where clients get haircuts and shaves and clean clothes
and they walk taller, smell better, feel like human beings again. And there are
some we've helped, supported and cheered while they struggled to get on track.
Just look through our Facebook page! We post these as much as possible, to show
how proud we are of the client who put in the hard work to climb out of a hole.
The risk is that we'll spend time, energy, and money and won't help everyone.
The reality is that to those we can and do help, it’s worth every bit of it!!

<h3><b>Campaign Purpose</b></h3>
<p><b><b>We are running TWO shelters for poor homeless  children  and 
women, with the aid of our Indian govt.  but  due to our corrupt 
officers, we  didn't  received </b><b>any of  the  aid  from  our  govt.
  nor  by  any  other  source  from  more  than  past 5 years, but  till
  yet  we  managed  to  run  these  shelters by our own, but  we are non
  profit  making   NGO. So,   it’s  getting  very  difficult  for  us 
 to  run  these shelters. As, we all know that, a NGO WORK for social 
DEVELOPMENT and fight for the  evil  aspects  to  eliminate it.  So,  we 
 can't  help  our  govt.  officers  by PROVIDING  them  bribes,  as they
 wanted, for forwarding our work files to GET aid.  So, our faith on our
  govt. got  fade  away. Even, we can't stop our working because  many 
 of  the  women and  children  are  now  dependent on us. They have faith 
&amp; believe on us. </b></b></p>

 are Amulya Kranti DDRC, A NGO from India, working for our society with a
 purpose of development. AMULYA KRANTI DDRC is a Society Registered 
under the Society Registration Act 1973 and working since last so many 
years since March 1993 in the field of Social Welfare and Upliftment of 
the general community in Madhya Pradesh, India, with the keen support of
 their members and a team of experts who are fully dedicated towards the
 social welfare work. 




Campaign Project - ""Shelter House""



Our
  primary  focus  is  women  &  children,  who  doesn't  have home to live, food to eat, no parental care & SUPPORT, no livelihood
 and  dominated by the  entire society. We serve them as a HELPING hand.
 We take them to our shelter home, we  provide them  food, shelter, 
 education, healthy homely environment, security  and try to 
provide them  all  basic amenities, which a kid deserves  to develop. 
 In this shelter home, we keep many homeless children and women 
together, they all live like a family. This shelter home is known as 
""Shelter House""


Campaign for
                                                 ""Poor Shelter Home Women""
                                                  ""Poor Street Children""
Our campaign is for those homeless children and women, who 
doesn't have a home to live, they are very poor, So that they can't even
 get food to eat, clothes to wear and they live on STREETS, sleep on 
FOOTHPATHS or aside of railway tracks. They even rummage public dustbins
 for food, collect garbages. We approach to them and take them to our 
shelter home. We PROVIDE them House, clothes, food, shelter, 
security, healthy environment, education, support, care, health 
facilities, vocational TRAININGS and many more which strengthen 
and helps them to develop and make their future. We are running two 
shelter HOMES one  in Dist. Hoshangabad and other in dist. sehore, Madhaya Pradesh, India.

                                                       ""WE ARE FROM""
                         


Campaign Purpose
We are running TWO shelters for poor homeless  children  and 
women, with the aid of our Indian govt.  but  due to our corrupt 
officers, we  didn't  received any of  the  aid  from  our  govt.
  nor  by  any  other  source  from  more  than  past 5 years, but  till
  yet  we  managed  to  run  these  shelters by our own, but  we are non
  profit  making   NGO. So,   it’s  getting  very  difficult  for  us 
 to  run  these shelters. As, we all know that, a NGO WORK for social 
DEVELOPMENT and fight for the  evil  aspects  to  eliminate it.  So,  we 
 can't  help  our  govt.  officers  by PROVIDING  them  bribes,  as they
 wanted, for forwarding our work files to GET aid.  So, our faith on our
  govt. got  fade  away. Even, we can't stop our working because  many 
 of  the  women and  children  are  now  dependent on us. They have faith 
& believe on us. 
""The main motive of this campaign is to serve them & Fulfill their dreams and making them self reliant with good careers""
                       
                                ""YOUR  LITTLE  EFFORT  CAN  SAVE  A  FUTURE""
                                                    ""Our Shelter House Kids""



                                                      

                                                     NO GOVT. SUPPORT 

    
                     TILL YET    --------WE ARE IN MIDDLE  

                                                      NO PRIVATE SUPPORT
                                                   
Importance of Campaign 
It is important because many life and futures depend on this campaign.  A
 little help & effort from your side will leads to support a life 
and a future of little children.  With  this  camping,  we  will  able 
 to continue our shelters smoothly and without any interruption.

<p style=""margin-bottom: 15.0pt;""><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-size: 16.0pt; font-family: Times; color: #1F1F1F;"">The
Rovernighter was inspired by Bronwyn (the Welsh Terrier pictured here). I was
on a contract due to work on Christmas Eve before travelling 200 miles
to spend Christmas with my family. I asked if Bron could come in with me so I
could leave straight from the office and started thinking what would I do with
her when she was in the office. A colleague jokingly said just put her in a bag
and bring her in.  This made me think where would I put her when she came in
and thought what if the bag converted to a bed? And the idea was born. After 2
years researching/thinking about it and development it is now ready to be manufactured
and delivered to the market. </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 15.0pt;""><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-size: 16.0pt; font-family: Times; color: #1F1F1F;"">Check out our gallery of pictures. </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 15.0pt;""><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-size: 16.0pt; font-family: Times; color: #1F1F1F;"">The bag is lightweight, weighing in at less than 2 kg when empty, is made of ballistic nylon, which is hardwearing, completely waterproof and wipe clean, with a 'memory foam' style mattress for comfortable sleeping for your pet (with washable cover). It contains several pockets for all your pets needs, including a thermal pocket to keep food cool and fresh on your journey. The bag converts in less than 20 seconds from a bag to a bed and back again. It is fully safety and fire regulation compliant and is made with the highest grade materials, with quality workmanship and handfinishing. Built to last, be convenient and stylish, this is the pawfect pet travelling system. Demand will be high so, pre-order your bag here on the perks page and be the first get this must have accessory for the stylish pet on the go. </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 15.0pt;""><b><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-size: 16.0pt; font-family: Times; color: #1F1F1F;"">Why back us?</span></b><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-size: 16.0pt; font-family: Times; color: #1F1F1F;""></span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 15.0pt;""><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-size: 16.0pt; font-family: Times; color: #1F1F1F;"">The
Rovernighter team is passionate about delivering a really unique quality
product for the pet market that helps save time for the busy pet owner and
provides the pet with its home comforts when it is travelling. As dedicated pet
owners we understand how pets can be stressed when travelling and out of their
familiar surroundings,  this product allows them to have the familiarity of
their favourite things which helps reduce their stress and keep them happy. </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 15.0pt;""><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-size: 16.0pt; font-family: Times; color: #1F1F1F;"">The
Rovernighter team leader is an experienced manager, business consultant who has helped deliver and improve business performance in a number of sectors. She
also has an MBA and is fully committed to delivering the vision of this product
and business, with a thoroughly thought through business plan and strategy. She
is also a dedicated pet lover and animal owner, so understands fully what pet
owners need and want. In her life she has owned horses, cats, dogs and even at
one point was the proud owner of a goat. She therefore understands the market and what pet owners want and
will respond to and what pets will love. Her own dog is fussy about beds/toys and treats, but has personally given her seal of approval to the Rovernighter, so we know dogs will go barking mad for it.  She is also a qualified horse-riding instructor and enjoys
getting to know and understand how animals’ behaviour is affected by their
environment and our behaviour towards them. So is well placed to ensure that
all products are pet friendly and deliver for both the end user and their
human. </span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 15.0pt;""><b><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-size: 16.0pt; font-family: Times; color: #1F1F1F;"">So what is the concept? </span></b><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-size: 16.0pt; font-family: Times; color: #1F1F1F;""></span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 15.0pt;""><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-size: 16.0pt; font-family: Times; color: #1F1F1F;"">The
Rovernighter is a compact, stylish complete travelling solution for pets.
Allowing the busy owner to have all their pets needs including all their 'furkids' fav toys in one easy to transport piece. No more spending 20mins
getting all their stuff together, just put in their food
and favourite toy, pick it up and walk out the door. After all
you don't want your baby to be lonely without their favourite cuddly toy or
best ball, when s/he is going through the unsettling phase of travelling. It is
stylish, time saving, totally pet focused and keeps the familiarity of
home with them.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 15.0pt;""><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-size: 16.0pt; font-family: Times; color: #1F1F1F;"">The
Rovernighter is the draw for what will be a lifestyle brand, which will
eventually include high quality coordinated accessories and pet related
gifts. The aim is for the brand to emulate the look of designer bags
(there is a bag and shoe lover behind the brand too!). So stylish, chic, totally
on trend, yet timesaving and pet approved. </span></p>

a unique product in a market that is globally worth around £70billion a year. This

stylish and comfortable solution. We have done our research and there is a
strong market for this product. We know it is wanted and we know we have a
product that both addresses a physical need and will also be an item that

</div></div>","The
Rovernighter was inspired by Bronwyn (the Welsh Terrier pictured here). I was
on a contract due to work on Christmas Eve before travelling 200 miles
to spend Christmas with my family. I asked if Bron could come in with me so I
could leave straight from the office and started thinking what would I do with
her when she was in the office. A colleague jokingly said just put her in a bag
and bring her in.  This made me think where would I put her when she came in
and thought what if the bag converted to a bed? And the idea was born. After 2
years researching/thinking about it and development it is now ready to be manufactured
and delivered to the market. 
Check out our gallery of pictures. 
The bag is lightweight, weighing in at less than 2 kg when empty, is made of ballistic nylon, which is hardwearing, completely waterproof and wipe clean, with a 'memory foam' style mattress for comfortable sleeping for your pet (with washable cover). It contains several pockets for all your pets needs, including a thermal pocket to keep food cool and fresh on your journey. The bag converts in less than 20 seconds from a bag to a bed and back again. It is fully safety and fire regulation compliant and is made with the highest grade materials, with quality workmanship and handfinishing. Built to last, be convenient and stylish, this is the pawfect pet travelling system. Demand will be high so, pre-order your bag here on the perks page and be the first get this must have accessory for the stylish pet on the go. 
Why back us?
The
Rovernighter team is passionate about delivering a really unique quality
product for the pet market that helps save time for the busy pet owner and
provides the pet with its home comforts when it is travelling. As dedicated pet
owners we understand how pets can be stressed when travelling and out of their
familiar surroundings,  this product allows them to have the familiarity of
their favourite things which helps reduce their stress and keep them happy. 
The
Rovernighter team leader is an experienced manager, business consultant who has helped deliver and improve business performance in a number of sectors. She
also has an MBA and is fully committed to delivering the vision of this product
and business, with a thoroughly thought through business plan and strategy. She
is also a dedicated pet lover and animal owner, so understands fully what pet
owners need and want. In her life she has owned horses, cats, dogs and even at
one point was the proud owner of a goat. She therefore understands the market and what pet owners want and
will respond to and what pets will love. Her own dog is fussy about beds/toys and treats, but has personally given her seal of approval to the Rovernighter, so we know dogs will go barking mad for it.  She is also a qualified horse-riding instructor and enjoys
getting to know and understand how animals’ behaviour is affected by their
environment and our behaviour towards them. So is well placed to ensure that
all products are pet friendly and deliver for both the end user and their
human. 
So what is the concept? 
The
Rovernighter is a compact, stylish complete travelling solution for pets.
Allowing the busy owner to have all their pets needs including all their 'furkids' fav toys in one easy to transport piece. No more spending 20mins
getting all their stuff together, just put in their food
and favourite toy, pick it up and walk out the door. After all
you don't want your baby to be lonely without their favourite cuddly toy or
best ball, when s/he is going through the unsettling phase of travelling. It is
stylish, time saving, totally pet focused and keeps the familiarity of
home with them.
The
Rovernighter is the draw for what will be a lifestyle brand, which will
eventually include high quality coordinated accessories and pet related
gifts. The aim is for the brand to emulate the look of designer bags
(there is a bag and shoe lover behind the brand too!). So stylish, chic, totally
on trend, yet timesaving and pet approved. 
What will your funding be used for? 
The
product development has already been done and we are now ready to launch
and need funding to deliver the first batch of bags and this unique, helpful
and stylish product and brand concept to the market. 
Funding
will be used for the product run, sales campaign, website development, product
placement, distribution admin and promotional work. 
What impact will we make? 
This is
a unique product in a market that is globally worth around £70billion a year. This
will provide a solution for all that travel their pets and want a quick,
stylish and comfortable solution. We have done our research and there is a
strong market for this product. We know it is wanted and we know we have a
product that both addresses a physical need and will also be an item that
people will want to own for its style, convenience and comfort levels for their
'furbaby'. 
How can you help? 
This is
an exciting journey we are taking and we have plans to make a real
splash. We would love for you to be part of this journey for what is aimed
to be a leader in the fashionable world of pets and accessories. We have the

</div></div>",".. Harry met Sally .. and we met huveja! .. our partner for life!! ;)
..
we all have a lot of dreams and goals .. and that is wonderful!! ;) .... but .. we are having trouble losing weight, exercising more, learning from this subject we always wanted, writing a book, and so on .., because that means changing our behaviors .. in other words, changing our old mental and physical habits .. .. and bad news here! .. that is very hard .. because from the Neuroscience, we now know that the difficulty for change behavior is very real and has a biological basis, seated in the normal functioning of the human brain itself .. .. therefore most of the time, it is not our fault that we can not change, but it is our own brain that deceives us .. our brain is the Big Bad Wolf .. oops! .... well, now I'm convinced that I am the Big Bad Wolf .. where is huveja ?? .. looks delicious ;) ..
.. just kidding!! ;) .. I think I understand what you try to say about not achieving our goals .. but who is huveja and how is huveja related with this whole situation?? ....  simply put .. huveja is a mobile app that help us to unleash our inner potential, or in other words, huveja  gives us the support to avoid our own brain deceiving us, and therefore making easier for us to make those behavioral changes which are required to achieve our goals .... huveja helps us to domesticate our inner Big Bad Wolf, our own brain, so to put all its energy at the service of our future goals, instead of wasting this energy in bad habits from the past .... well, now I know that the change is hard because our brain tends to deceive us ..  so, I want some support to change my behavior in order to achieve my goals .. how is huveja providing this support? .. is huveja a magician disguised as mobile app? .... a magician? not really! .. huveja is a social technology designed especially to help to decrease the cognitive load in the process of behavioral change .. it means that by using huveja, our  cognitive styles and capacities are molded in such a way, that we become aware of when and how our brain is trying to deceive us, while at the same time, huveja is supporting us to automate the needed strategies to avoid the obstacles that our brain creates us .. and then it becomes easier for us to create the required changes from that new position ..
.. trying to facilitate with a single strategy the required change for achieving any type of goal, is almost impossible, because the specifics, resources and needs that each goal type is demanding are making necessary different strategies for each one .. therefore to overcome this limitation is that the huveja 's goals were created .. where each huveja 's goal  is a predefined goal type .. such as e.g. ""Loose weight"", ""Exercise regularly"", ""Learning this subject"", and so on ..


.. and for each of these predefined huveja 's goals, we work with a team of behavioral psychologists, coaches, and researchers from the field of Neuroscience and Machine Learning, with the aim of creating a behavioral model that is specific for this huveja 's goal .. and it is this developed model that that is  making easier for us to make those behavioral changes which are required to achieve our goals ..




.. the latest research in Neuroscience is elucidating the normal patterns of the brain that cause the difficulty for behavior change, and this research is also providing the means to overcome them more easily .. a huveja 's goal  is using these means tailored to  the specifics, needs and resources required by its goal type, as for example  ""Loose weight"" ..





.. a huveja 's goal  is based in a behavioral model that is applying Machine Learning, a branch of Artificial Intelligence, in order to personalize this model to your unique needs ..





.. a huveja 's goal  is using coaching techniques to create a motivating atmosphere for performance, in order to make real that change could be inspiring ..





.. all of us are finding difficult to go alone through the change journey .. but in huveja we are no longer alone on the path to achieve our dreams and goals .. because in huveja we are making the journey while we are developing real human relationships through interactions that matters and not mere connections ..







.. well, well .. although you almost convinced me that I'm the Big Bad Wolf .. don't worry I'm still vegetarian .. so how I can be part of huveja? ..

.. thanks for your engagement!! ;) .. right now we are finishing a private Alpha Test, and we are looking for people and resources to move to the next stage, a private Beta Testing ..



.. all of our alpha testers agree on one thing .. the current huveja 's design and usability are baa baaad .. so we want to hire a Dali UX/UI designer for the Beta Testing ..



.. from the feedback collected with the Alpha Test,  we know that huveja is asking for some tweaks.. as we are busy with the huveja 's server side code, we want to hire a magical programmer that helps us to improve the huveja 's mobile part ..



.. for the Beta Testing we want to expand the capacity of the servers running the huveja 's server side code, as for example the improved Machine Learning algorithms .. 



.. learning this subject you always wanted is a great goal by itself .. and also learning is a path to achieve another goals .. then for each additional $600  being collected in the campaign,   huveja is using them to give the opportunity to someone somewhere in the World,  to learn something new through edX, Udacity or Coursera .. 





.. and ladies and gentlemen ..


.. the show has started!!! .. given the huveja 's current state .. in just three months we can have the huveja 's new version ready for the private Beta Testing .. yes!!! ..





... aha! .. now what we all have been waiting for .. the perks!!! ;) ..




.. each perk is reflected in the film that gives it its name .. each one is a journey in time and space through the land of our collective memory and emotions .. and for the what it is now, and what will become .. we are happy to share them with you!!! .. choose one from the top-right column here!! ;) ..

Otra limitación de esta red social es que lo que en ella se comparte, se va perdiendo en una time line infinita, sin que podamos rescatar conclusiones interesantes referente a la gordofobia y sus implicaciones.Por todo ello, concluimos que necesitamos más espacio, la página de Facebook se nos empieza a quedar pequeña. Y pensamos que una página web propia nos permitiría expandirnos sin límites.Eso si, ¡no podemos lograrlo sin tu ayuda!

¿Qué necesitamos y qué obtienes tú a cambio? 

Crear esta página web y mantenerla en buenas condiciones para que se convierta en una buena plataforma de expansión de nuestra comunidad cuesta dinero. Por desgracia, las personas que administramos STOP Gordofobia realizamos esta actividad como  una forma de activismo personal y no contamos con recursos económicos para poder hacer frente a dichos gastos. 

Es por ello que necesitamos esos 600 € por lo que insistimos: ¡te necesitamos! 
¿A dónde irían destinados?, pues a:



Comprar el/los dominio/s de la web

Costear un buen hosting (capacidad de almacenamiento de la web ) que nos  permita afrontar la inmensa cantidad de imágenes, testimonios, recursos y apuntes teóricos que se generan en la comunidad
Adquirir un buen sistema anti-hacker
Contratar a un diseñador web
Crear y enviar las recompensas a quienes aporten su granito de arena

Y, en caso de que sobrase dinero, este se guardaría para hacer frente a los gastos anuales por la compra del dominio o para aumentar la capacidad de la propia página web.

En un apartado posterior explicamos las recompensas que ofrecemos para las personas que deseen aportar su granito de arena a nuestra causa.¿Por qué ayudar a STOP Gordofobia? 
Porque queremos cambiar el mundo. Queremos seguir luchando por una sociedad libre de discriminación hacia las personas gordas, libre de complejos hacia nuestros cuerpos. Una sociedad que celebre la diversidad en todas sus formas. En definitiva, queremos hacer realidad nuestra principal consigna: ¡TODOS LOS CUERPOS, TODAS LAS BELLEZAS!
Si la página te ha ayudado a ti o a alguien que conoces a quererse un poco más, si crees que es un buen recurso para quienes no están a gusto con sus cuerpos, si crees que nos merecemos seguir creciendo y extendiendo nuestra filosofía... hazte parte del proyecto y ¡COLABORA!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hello, my name is Mary Rhei, President of RHEI-MAID. Several years ago, 
my parents were ready to give up the business that they had been running
 for over 50 years - crafting delicious artisanal Korean condiments 
using family recipes handed down over generations.  I've worked for RHEI-MAID since I was 5 years old.  Fast forward 40
 years... Today I'm trying to make my parents' and my dream a reality by

</h3>Gochujang is a fermented red pepper paste made of rice, red chili pepper, sweetener and soybean. Gochujang is spicy and has a deep, rich flavor that is pungent and loaded with umami. It is essential to Korean cuisine and extremely versatile -- as a finishing sauce, a soup base or by itself as a condiment. Gochujang has a thick consistency due to its rice base and is deeper in flavor than most hot sauces due to its long fermentation period.<br/><br/><b>Traditional Korean Dishes That Use Gochujang:<br/></b><ul>

crushed soybeans that are first formed into blocks, dried and fermented.
 The blocks are then placed in salt water to continue fermenting. When 
ready, the solids are separated to make doenjang.<br/><br/><h3>What is Ganjang?</h3>Ganjang

It's About Authenticity And Tradition, Not Mass Production</h3><p>RHEI-MAID sets itself apart from the competition because of 
tradition and authentic Korean flavors -- all three products are made 
with recipes and processes that date as far back as three generations. 
Unlike some of our competitors, RHEI-MAID's fermentation process is not expedited. It takes place over time, just like it did over 100 years ago, right in nature's kitchen.  As a result, RHEI-MAID products have 
that deep rich traditional old-world Korean flavor that will make any 
Halmoni 
(Grandma) proud. </p><h3><br/></h3><h3>Wholesome Goodness<ul>
<li> Gluten-Free</li>
<li>All natural, no artificial flavors added </li>
<li>No high fructose corn syrup</li>
<li>90% U.S. sourced ingredients</li>
<li>Soy products are vegan </li>
</ul>
</h3>Grandma didn't use high 
fructose corn syrup, and neither do we. We use high quality ingredients -- 90% of our 
ingredients are U.S sourced -- and we do NOT use additives or artificial 
flavors. RHEI-MAID products are gluten-free and our 
Doenjang and Ganjang are both gluten-free and vegan, too.   <br/><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>When Good Is Bad: Tale of Product Scarcity<br/>
</h3>Our
 products are aged the natural, unexpedited way. 
All of our products are aged for no less than 6 months and our Ganjang 
for 3 years! This wait creates a supply issue, especially on the retail side. Having a factory should enable us to increase production by 10 times after the first year! This increase in supply should also help us to lower production costs, as ingredients will be purchased in bulk.  We will be happy pass this savings along to our customers.  Having a factory should also enable RHEI-MAID products to be more readily available, particularly in the retail market. <br/><br/><h3>Factory Benefits<br/>
</h3><ul>
<li>Factory should enable RHEI-MAID products to be sold to retail markets, currently unavailable due to lack of supply</li>
<li>Factory should help us buy in bulk and REDUCE EXPENSES, which will be passed to customers<br/>
</li>
<li>Factory should increase production by 10 times current capacity</li>
</ul><br/><h3>Hang on, It's Not Just Any Factory </h3><p>We can't move into just any factory because we have complicated issues with the fermentation process: 
</p><ul>
<li>Pungent odors</li>
<li>Spice factors</li>
</ul>
<p>We need a factory off the beaten path because of these issues.  Herein lies the problem: the rent for our current factory options is double our original budgeted 
amount. WE NEED YOUR HELP to cover this shortfall of expenses -- 
$175,000.</p>
<ul>
<li>$125,000 for at least a year's lease (don't forget, our 
products are aged for no less than 6 months and our ganjang for 3 
years)</li>
<li>$50,000 for equipment and machinery</li>
</ul><p>
If we do not reach our goal, we will need to reduce our projected 
production capacity, which will significantly impact the future amount 
of RHEI-MAID product available in the retail markets. </p><div>
<h3>With A Little Help From Our Friends...</h3>Continuing RHEI-MAID has been one of the most humbling experiences of my life.  I am so overwhelmingly grateful to all that are helping us bring authentic, traditional Korean artisanal sauces to the retail market, by funding our factory.

Hello, my name is Mary Rhei, President of RHEI-MAID. Several years ago, 
my parents were ready to give up the business that they had been running
 for over 50 years - crafting delicious artisanal Korean condiments 
using family recipes handed down over generations.  I've worked for RHEI-MAID since I was 5 years old.  Fast forward 40
 years... Today I'm trying to make my parents' and my dream a reality by
 renting a larger factory to manufacture RHEI-MAID's artisanal Korean sauces for widespread retail distribution.RHEI-MAID, Manufacturer of Artisanal Korean Sauces  
Gochujang
Doenjang
Ganjang
What is Gochujang? 
Gochujang is a fermented red pepper paste made of rice, red chili pepper, sweetener and soybean. Gochujang is spicy and has a deep, rich flavor that is pungent and loaded with umami. It is essential to Korean cuisine and extremely versatile -- as a finishing sauce, a soup base or by itself as a condiment. Gochujang has a thick consistency due to its rice base and is deeper in flavor than most hot sauces due to its long fermentation period.Traditional Korean Dishes That Use Gochujang:
Bibimbap
Bulgogi
Korean Fried Chicken 

Doekbokki
What is Doenjang?Doenjang is a fermented soybean paste made of 
crushed soybeans that are first formed into blocks, dried and fermented.
 The blocks are then placed in salt water to continue fermenting. When 
ready, the solids are separated to make doenjang.What is Ganjang?Ganjang
 is Korean soy sauce. Ganjang is the liquid that the 
soybean blocks (deonjang) were immersed in to be fermented. After the solids are separated to make doenjang, the remaining liquid is ganjang.Look Who's Using RHEI-MAID

<h2><span>Why Should You Support This Campaign?</span></h2>Get HOPE Global's mission is to train women around the world and transform their lives. Your donation will help one of 16 women, hopefully more, to start their own small business. For only $175 a woman, or whatever you can give toward the amount, a woman in Ghana will be able to change her own life, the life of her family, and the community as a whole. With an income due to this business, she is less likely to be in poverty, have inadequate health, or live on the streets. But she needs your help.<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>

<h2><span>Get HOPE Global History</span></h2>Get HOPE Global began as HOPE of the Harvest in 2008 as the micro-enterprise ministry arm of Women of the Harvest. In order to offer training programs to a wider audience, Get HOPE Global (HOPE) launched as a separate non-profit entity in 2012 and expanded our service offerings in the process.  HOPE began as an (amazing!) all-volunteer team, and with the exception of three paid part-time staff members the team is still made primarily of volunteers who all have been clearly “called” to serve as champions of impoverished women and girls in need of “hope.”

<h2><em><strong></strong></em></h2>
<h2><span>How Get HOPE Global Works To Alleviate Human Trafficking</span></h2>Get HOPE Global’s faith-based business training program and microloan opportunities address the above UN recommendations.  The training program works to encourage, equip, and empower impoverished women and at-risk girls with life-giving HOPE to build a better business, build a better life, and build a transforming faith in Jesus Christ.  Not only are the girls and women taught basic business skills and given the opportunity to secure a microloan to start or improve their own businesses, but they are also taught character-driven biblical lessons that support success in business and in life.  Through a comprehensive one-year program, they are empowered to develop a business plan, launch or expand a business, and plan for long-term sustainability via ethical business practices.  At the completion of the program, women are empowered to move out of the imprisonment of poverty and build a better future.<p></p>

</div></div>","Why Should You Support This Campaign?Get HOPE Global's mission is to train women around the world and transform their lives. Your donation will help one of 16 women, hopefully more, to start their own small business. For only $175 a woman, or whatever you can give toward the amount, a woman in Ghana will be able to change her own life, the life of her family, and the community as a whole. With an income due to this business, she is less likely to be in poverty, have inadequate health, or live on the streets. But she needs your help.



Get HOPE Global HistoryGet HOPE Global began as HOPE of the Harvest in 2008 as the micro-enterprise ministry arm of Women of the Harvest. In order to offer training programs to a wider audience, Get HOPE Global (HOPE) launched as a separate non-profit entity in 2012 and expanded our service offerings in the process.  HOPE began as an (amazing!) all-volunteer team, and with the exception of three paid part-time staff members the team is still made primarily of volunteers who all have been clearly “called” to serve as champions of impoverished women and girls in need of “hope.”



How Get HOPE Global Works To Alleviate Human TraffickingGet HOPE Global’s faith-based business training program and microloan opportunities address the above UN recommendations.  The training program works to encourage, equip, and empower impoverished women and at-risk girls with life-giving HOPE to build a better business, build a better life, and build a transforming faith in Jesus Christ.  Not only are the girls and women taught basic business skills and given the opportunity to secure a microloan to start or improve their own businesses, but they are also taught character-driven biblical lessons that support success in business and in life.  Through a comprehensive one-year program, they are empowered to develop a business plan, launch or expand a business, and plan for long-term sustainability via ethical business practices.  At the completion of the program, women are empowered to move out of the imprisonment of poverty and build a better future.



Help women like Theresa Ab. from Ghana attain a HOPE loan!Theresa is a single mother who had almost lost all hope until the intervention of the Get-HOPE-Global training program. She is now hopeful that, with this training and the HOPE loan, she can start a business and better her life. Her shop will be convenient for the customers in her community, who now travel a far distance to purchase vegetables and other food items. Her loan will enable her to purchase food items to stock her store. Help Get-HOPE-Global provide microloans for Theresa’s group and others like it! 





Or help Vera launch her business of selling biscuits.
Vera is a single mother of a young daughter, and she now has hope for a better future for them both as a result of the HOPE program. She plans to use her loan funds to purchase biscuits from a wholesaler in the city center, which she will then distribute to table-top retailers in the villages. Vera is a committed business woman and group member.  




About HOPE micro-loan groups* ::The impoverished women and at-risk girls who are part of a HOPE microloan group have completed the required pre-qualification sessions and assignments and have been recommended for a HOPE microloan by a program leader. In addition they have each committed to the following:
Faithful attendance and completion of the business training course
Personal savings
Mutula respect and encouragement of others in the group
Responsibility of repayment of all the loans within the group - if one woman cannot make a payment, the other women will make it for her. This creates an environment of cohesion and growth as a group, not against each other.
Repayment rate is 99.6%
*Although this is a loan, all money paid back will go directly into the loan pool for other first-time business women in the program.

cycling, hoping to avoid flying as much as possible. We started off with as
much money as we could possibly save, but sooner or later any funds you have are about to run out due to some foreseeable or sometimes unforeseeable circumstances.

<p>We will soon be facing an ocean we will have to

<li><b>3 visas for Indonesia</b></li>
<li><b>boat and/or ferry expenses to travel Indonesian
     islands in order to reach Bali</b></li>
</ul><p>This is not the first time when we have run
into problems of financial character. When our <b>bicycles got stolen</b> in Crimea, <b>we
found jobs in Georgia</b> and earned money for new ones. When that was not
enough, we <b>sold tea on the street</b>

It's time we brought opportunity to the creative skill that is bursting from South Africa's seams.   Empowerment through Skills Training Business & marketing support for those wanting to start their own businesses Providing a stable and generous income for our Creators- whether through partner organizations, our own workshop, or those who have launched their own creative businesses.   After 2 years of laying the groundwork - we are ready to take the next step and take Sparrow Society to the NEXT LEVEL!  Help us reach more communities and more artisans by donating towards this campaign!



The Impact
Our products don't just give a portion to charity - the products themselves are the avenue of empowerment enabling our Creators to work towards their own development instead of relying on charity and government assistance.  
It's the difference between just paying for a woman's child to go to school, and actually empowering her with the opportunity to provide for her own family and support her child's education! It doesn't just stop the downward spiral of the poverty trap- but actually starts the journey to reverse it!

We create fun, dignifying and well paying jobs that allow artisans to reach their full creative and business potential.
You can help us launch a Creative Hub to take these efforts even further and reach even more people and communities!

</div></div>","What Is Buy The Block Intending To Correct? ""According to a report, African-Americans have lost over half of their wealth since the beginning of the recession through falling home ownership rates and loss of jobs,"" it reads.Pew Research Center data from 2011 that shows the median net worth of black households decreased by 53 percent from $12,124 in 2005 to $5,677 in 2009. Technically, this loss fits the timeline of the housing crisis in 2006.More closely follows the financial crisis of 2007. According to that report, median net worth of the black household decreased from $19,200 in 2007 to $11,000 in 2013 (in 2013 dollars). That’s a loss of 43 percent. LETS GET TO 100% IN LESS THAN  11 DAYS! Buy The Block is ALL or NOTHING! If we do not reach 100% of our goal, you will receive 100% of your contribution. Home ownership rates are down, way down. That much is no secret. People are renting later into their lives, often with no plans to ever own their own piece of property. It’s a sad state of affairs, one that has been building and developing for a long time now, one that we can no longer ignore, one that we need to face head on if we are ever going to do anything about it.

Our Progress on Buy the Block
BuyTheBlock.com has been in development for almost a year. Prototype versions of the website and app have been made; we have a $250,000 real estate portfolio; we've got partnerships lined up. We’re ready to become the property investing platform for everyone, but we have a few small tasks left to complete before our vision is realized:
· We need to build out the back-end software.· We’d like to refine the production versions of our website and app.· We need to beta-test the website and  app at scale.· We need to finalize and solidify a few legal items.
When we accomplish the final steps above, we’ll be ready to launch! With the support of excited backers like you, we predict a successful January 2017 roll out of BuyTheBlock.com and from there, the sky’s the limit! Help us reach our goal and back us on IndieGoGo today.
This is only the beginning. Let's plant the seed to create wealth.

<li>
<b>Extreme poverty</b> and the lack of access to legal, sustainable

     and development projects in, the Amazon comes from or take place near
     urban centers or conservation areas, and most often these do not include
     the voice of the local people. </li>
<li>
<b>Education.</b> There is little opportunity to pursue higher
     education, and even less opportunity for a university graduate to apply
     their degree working in their home area. </li>

<p><b>Our Immediate Goal: </b><b>$110,791.00.</b></p>
<p>Stretch Goal: $376,585.00</p>
<p>We have
prioritized and divided our budget into three phases, each roughly represents
4-6 months of work. </p>

implement our first phase, 4-6 months of work,  we need $110,791.00. Our hope:
full funding for the first three phases of project, a total of$376,585.00<b>.</b></p>
<p>These funds will allow us to jump-start the project and develop
the project’s credibility as we apply for institutional funds and large grants.
If we pass our goal, we will be able to continue moving forward with even more
momentum. If we fall short of this goal, we will use what we raise in the order
described below. Each activity builds on the one before and will have a
significant impact of its own.</p>

required. </u></i></p>
<h3><b>RISKS AND HURDLES</b></h3>
<p><b>Risk:</b> That the cacao does not produce as we expect
and/or the market for high quality cacao crashes. </p>
<p><b>Our Method:</b> Before our participating
farmers even clear a weed or field, we are conducting studies to identify and
select high-quality, high-producing, and resistant varieties, and we are
thoroughly studying their requirements. We are working in close collaboration
with multiple Peruvian institutions as well as the USDA. This will, however, be
a process in which the farmers make consistent improvements. In addition,
though cacao will be a focus, we are working to create a mixed system with a
variety of products for both local and export consumption—if one market begins
to fail, the other products will be there to help the farmers through. </p>
<p><b>Risk:</b> One or multiple of the coordinating team
members can not remain in their position (due to sickness, a change of jobs,
accident, or what-have-you). </p>
<p><b>Our Method:</b> People change,
circumstances change, and life happens. With the idea of creating a long-term
sustainable project, we are already recruiting people who can take over the
coordinating team member roles (should need arise) and who, in the meantime,
are deepening and broadening our expertise, energy, and networks. </p>
<p><b>Risk:</b> Climate changes affect the communities in
unprecedented ways. </p>
<p><b>Our Method:</b> This is already
happening, and is one of the driver’s of our project. Starting with the first
phase, we are including research that focuses on understanding the ways in which
climate changes are affecting the communities, ways they might affect the
communities, ways in which the communities are successfully adapting, and
strategies they could pursue. Working with the new effort to establish a cacao
germplasm bank in Iquitos, we will be identifying cacao varieties most able to
adapt the changing circumstances. </p>
<p><b>Risk:</b> The exchange rate changes. </p>
<p><b>Our Method:</b> In calculating our
budget, we have used a slightly less favorable (to the project) than the
average exchange rate over the past few years.</p>
<h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
<p>VASI, in
the words of a local teacher, is a vision from Amazonia that proposes to help
the world to live in a way that is economically, culturally, socially,
spiritually, and ecologically sustainable and which includes and recognizes the
rights of all people. We hope you will join us in supporting this exciting
project. </p><p><b>Thank You!    ¡Gracias!   Irake!</b></p><p>Spanish version follows here.</p><p><b>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</b></p><p>

<p><b></b></p>
<h3>
<b><b>Riesgos Y </b></b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Obstáculos</span>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>Riesgo:</b> Que el cacao no produzca lo esperado y/o el
Mercado para cacao de alta calidad caiga.</p>
<p><b>Nuestro Método:</b> Antes de que nuestros
agricultores participantes limpien sus chacras, nosotros estamos llevando a
cabo estudios para identificar y seleccionar variedades de alta calidad, de
alta producción, y resistentes. Estamos estudiando a fondo sus necesidades.
Estamos trabajando en estrecha colaboración con múltiples instituciones
peruanas, así como el USDA. Además, aunque el cacao será un foco, estamos trabajando
para crear un sistema mixto con una variedad de productos, tanto para el
consumo local y la exportación; si un mercado comienza a caer, los demás
productos estarán allí para ayudar a los agricultores.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Riesgo:</b> Uno o varios de los miembros del equipo de
coordinación no pueden permanecer en su posición (por enfermedad, un cambio de
puestos de trabajo, accidente, o lo que usted quiera).</p>
<p><b>Nuestro Método:</b> La gente cambia, las
circunstancias cambian, y la vida pasa. Con la idea de crear un proyecto sostenible
a largo plazo, ya estamos reclutando personas que pueden hacerse cargo de las
funciones de los miembros del equipo de coordinación (si habrá necesidad)
y que, mientras tanto, están profundizando y ampliando nuestra experiencia,
energía y redes.</p>
<p><b>Riesgo:</b> Los cambios climáticos afectan a las
comunidades de una manera sin precedentes.</p>
<p><b>Nuestro Método:</b> Esto ya está sucediendo,
y es uno de los impulsos de nuestro proyecto. A partir de la primera fase en el
proyecto, estamos incluyendo la investigación que se centra en la comprensión
de las formas en que los cambios climáticos están afectando a las comunidades,
las maneras en que pueden afectar a las comunidades, las formas en que las
comunidades se están adaptando con éxito, y las estrategias que podrían seguir.
Trabajaremos también con el nuevo esfuerzo para establecer un banco germplasma
de cacao en Iquitos, estaremos identificando variedades de cacao más capaces de
adaptarse a las circunstancias cambiantes.</p>
<p><b>Riesgo:</b> Cambios en los tipos de cambio.</p>
<p><b>Nuestro Método:</b> En el cálculo de nuestro
presupuesto, hemos utilizado un tipo de cambio un poco menos favorable (al
proyecto) que el promedio en los últimos años.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b><b>Conclusión</b></b></h3>

University students 

VASI empowers communities, bettering 1000s of peoples’ lives, and
brings you delicious, sustainable, organic chocolate.
Collaborate with us to
contribute to the conservation and sustainability of the Peruvian Amazonian
region and the United States by helping to create legal and sustainable
business opportunities, providing access to higher education, and developing scientific
research to inform both local and regional policy and development decisions.
The
Challenge


Extreme poverty and the lack of access to legal, sustainable
     income producing activities. 

Lack of local input. The majority of scientific knowledge about,
     and development projects in, the Amazon comes from or take place near
     urban centers or conservation areas, and most often these do not include
     the voice of the local people. 

Education. There is little opportunity to pursue higher
     education, and even less opportunity for a university graduate to apply
     their degree working in their home area. 

Did you know the Amazon is home to cacao—the fruit that gives us
Chocolate, and that a significant
portion of the world’s chocolate is produced by forced child labor and slaves?

The VASI
Solution

Community driven scientific research 
Scholarships for higher education 
Community driven sustainable business projects and direct trade agreements to craft
     chocolate makers, chefs, specialty food markets, and others.

please, click here: https://proyectovasi.wordpress.com/documents-and-publicationsdocumentos-y-publicaciones/

An Opportunity



Few varieties of cacao are used on the commercial
scale. Based on the lack of genetic diversity, the increasing presence of pests
and fungal issues, and increasing demand, soon there may not be enough production of cacao to meet demand for
chocolate. 
VASI
will use wild, native, and heirloom
varieties of cacao to develop unique
flavor profiles, contribute to the conservation of genetic diversity,
increase resistance to plagues and floods, and be adapted to local conditions. Our
cacao will be exported via direct trade
agreements to craft chocolate makers. We are already establishing
relationships with chocolate makers in Michigan and other parts of the world
and Peru.
Growing pressure on the communities,
landscapes, and resources, the lack of basic services and extreme poverty, the
dearth of legal, sustainable, opportunities, and the fact that few residents
have the opportunity to further their studies beyond secondary school, leave
project area residents vulnerable, disempowered, and more likely to get caught
up in dangerous unsustainable and/or illegal activities. 
THE AMAZON


The Amazon is the birthplace of
     cacao—the fruit from which we get chocolate

The Amazon is one of the
     world’s two largest bodies of fresh water
The Amazon Basin contains one of
     the highest levels of biological and cultural diversity in the world
The Amazon plays a significant
     role in global climate




VASI an integrated vision to contribute to the
conservation of freshwater and biodiversity, to help stabilize global climate,
and to empower communities to meet these challenges.

US $ 6,000.00 Cacao Grower’s School –
Trip to Pucallpa and Tarapoto with discounts available if you would like to
continue to Iquitos
The first 5 that donate $6000, and, therefore
sponsor the participation of 5 community members in the cacao training course
at ICT (Institute of Tropical Cultivars), will be invited to participate in all
our course activities and the special activities we are organizing in Pucallpa.

**Don’t
miss this one of a kind opportunity!!! If you have always wanted to learn
more about cacao or are considering your own cacao farm or project, this is the
class for you. The ICT, is highly respected at the international level, and
charges a flat rate for the course. For you to do it on your own, would be both
extremely expensive, and you would miss out on the shared experiences and camaraderie
and the chance to learn and share with expert Amazonian farmers. We are in the
process of working out the course syllabus and schedule, if you are interested,
please, write us info@proyectovasi.org.
Our trip will start with a 12 hr bus ride from Pucallpa
to Tarapoto. Your bus fare will be included, or you can meet us in Tarapoto. Once
in Tarapoto, we will head directly to the ICT for a 5-6 day intensive (7:00 am
– 8pm) course. Lodging and meals are included. At the end of the course, we
will return to Pucallpa (again, your bus fare is included) for a special one-day
workshop focusing on community and cacao producer organizations, associations, and
committees. We will assume the cost of your food and lodging, with our team
members, for three days in Pucallpa. These will be basic, safe, accommodations
and simple, healthy meals. The whole course will be taught in Spanish. A team
member will be able to serve as a part-time translator.
We will cover your round-trip
expenses from Tarapoto to Pucallpa on the bus with the team, your participation
in the course in Tarapoto including food and lodging, your participation in the
mini course in Pucallpa, as well as food and lodging in Pucallpa for 3 days.
All other expenses, including your ticket to Pucallpa, your travel and accident
insurance (a requirement for participation), and your immunizations (also
required) will be yours.
If you are interested in a tour of Pucallpa or
Tarapoto before or after the event, we can put you in contact with reliable
agencies and tour guides. If you are interested in continuing your journey to visit
the island city of Iquitos, we can give arrange a 50% discount at the Hotel Emperador
Terraza (http://emperadorterraza.com/web/)
for a stay of up to four (4) days, in a double room with air conditioning or
fan. (The course will take place in late March or early April 2016, date to be
determined soon)
US $ 6000.00 Cacao Grower Hero

If you believe in this
mission, and want to help make sure we can take our community representatives
to the cacao training course, but can’t make the course, you can still sponsor
5 community members participation. We have put together this special package,
just for you, our hero.  Due to
Indiegogo’s limits on the number of perks, it is not currently listed in the
clickable perks, so just let us know, and we can make it available to you.
To begin with, we will send you a thank you card
signed by the course participants and hard-bound full color memory book
describing the course. For a full description, see the Padrino de Cacaotero perk

shirts, two VASI baseball hats, 75 seeds sown in your honor, and all the rest
of the “Architect” Package. 
US $ 8700.00 Community Nursery Sponsor (Limit 9)
Fundamental to
the applied project’s success, will be the construction of community nurseries
in each of the towns. These nurseries will be where we initially plant the
cacao, tropical hardwood, and emergent canopy species that will go on to form
the agroforestry fields. 
As a community
nursery sponsor or godparent, you will receive a thank you card signed by the
town’s residents and a high-quality commemorative plaque in your name (or the
name of the person(s) or organization you indicate). The plaque will include
the nursery’s inauguration date and the name of the community. A similar, but
weatherized plaque will hang over the nursery’s entrance recognizing your
valuable and lasting contribution to sustainable development of the community.(Shipping date:  March 2017 depending
on nursery inauguration dates)

If you wish to
extend your stay with a visit to a Amazon lodge in the rainforest, we can
arrange discounts at the Curassow Amazon Lodge (www.curassowlodge.com)-- minimum
stay includes three days and two nights, and is dependent on availability.
Availability is dependent on prior arrangements. You
must make your reservation with the hotel, before you book your flights or any
other part of your trip. Please, do so in advance as the hotel is small and can
fill-up quickly. Fares to and from Iquitos, dinnners, and other expenses not
metioned above are not included. Travel insurance and vaccinations are
required. 
RISKS AND HURDLES
Risk: That the cacao does not produce as we expect
and/or the market for high quality cacao crashes. 
Our Method: Before our participating
farmers even clear a weed or field, we are conducting studies to identify and
select high-quality, high-producing, and resistant varieties, and we are
thoroughly studying their requirements. We are working in close collaboration
with multiple Peruvian institutions as well as the USDA. This will, however, be
a process in which the farmers make consistent improvements. In addition,
though cacao will be a focus, we are working to create a mixed system with a
variety of products for both local and export consumption—if one market begins
to fail, the other products will be there to help the farmers through. 
Risk: One or multiple of the coordinating team
members can not remain in their position (due to sickness, a change of jobs,
accident, or what-have-you). 
Our Method: People change,
circumstances change, and life happens. With the idea of creating a long-term
sustainable project, we are already recruiting people who can take over the
coordinating team member roles (should need arise) and who, in the meantime,
are deepening and broadening our expertise, energy, and networks. 
Risk: Climate changes affect the communities in
unprecedented ways. 
Our Method: This is already
happening, and is one of the driver’s of our project. Starting with the first
phase, we are including research that focuses on understanding the ways in which
climate changes are affecting the communities, ways they might affect the
communities, ways in which the communities are successfully adapting, and
strategies they could pursue. Working with the new effort to establish a cacao
germplasm bank in Iquitos, we will be identifying cacao varieties most able to
adapt the changing circumstances. 
Risk: The exchange rate changes. 
Our Method: In calculating our
budget, we have used a slightly less favorable (to the project) than the
average exchange rate over the past few years.
Conclusion
VASI, in
the words of a local teacher, is a vision from Amazonia that proposes to help
the world to live in a way that is economically, culturally, socially,
spiritually, and ecologically sustainable and which includes and recognizes the
rights of all people. We hope you will join us in supporting this exciting
project. Thank You!    ¡Gracias!   Irake!Spanish version follows here.---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Colabora con nosotros a contribuir a la conservación y sostenibilidad
de la Amazonía Peruana y de los Estados Unidos, a través de oportunidades
de trabajo legales y sostenibles,  acceso a educación superior, e investigaciones científicas que provean información científica para contribuir a las políticas locales y  regionales.

La Problemática


Extrema pobreza y la falta de actividades productivos
     cuales son legales y sostenibles.

Las voces locales son excluidas. La mayoría del
     conocimiento científico de la Amazonía y los proyectos de desarrollo,
     vienen de fuentes externas o se llevan a cabo en centros urbanos o áreas de
     conservación, y mayormente no incluyen las voces de la gente local.

Educación. Existen pocas oportunidades de buscar educación
     superior

¿Sabías que la Amazonía es el punto de
orígen de cacao, la fruta de que viene Chocolate, y que una porción significativa
del chocolate a nivel mundial está producido por niños y esclavos?
La Solución VASI

Pocas son
las variedades de cacao que son utilizadas a escala comercial. Basado en la
falta de diversidad genética, el aumento de la presencia de plagas, y
la creciente demanda, predicen que pronto no habrá producción suficiente de
cacao para alcanzar la demanda de chocolate.

VASI
desarrollará perfiles de sabores únicos, contribuirá a la
conservación de la diversidad genética, y aumentará la resistencia a plagas e
inundaciones, y utilizará variedades adaptadas a las condiciones locales. VASI
utilizará variedades de cacao, silvestres, nativas, y de la vieja usanza.
Nuestro cacao será exportado por medio de Tratados de Comercio Directos con Chocolateras
Artesanales. Ya estamos estableciendo relaciones con chocolateras en
Michigan y otras partes del mundo y Perú.

La
creciente presión en las comunidades, paisajes, y recursos, la falta de
servicios básicos y la extrema pobreza, la escasez de oportunidades legales y sostenibles,
y el hecho de que pocos residentes tienen las oportunidades de continuar sus
estudios más allá de secundaria, deja vulnerables a los residentes del area del proyecto, impotentes, y más susceptibles a quedar atrapados en actividades
ilegales y/o no sostenibles. 
Amazonía

Lugar de origen del cacao, el fruto de donde obtenemos el
     chocolate.
La Amazonía es uno de los grandes cuerpos de agua dulce del mundo.
La Cuenca del Amazonas posee uno de los mayors niveles de
     diversidad biológica y cultural del mundo.
La Amazonía juega un importante rol en el clima global.
VASI, una visión integral para contribuir a la conservación del agua dulce y la biodiversidad, para ayudar a estabilizar el clima mundial, y para empoderar a las comunidades para que enfrenten estos desafíos._______________________

*** Algunas notas importantes:
1. Fechas aproximadas de envío se enumeran aquí para cada elemento. Estos
son los peores escenarios. Esperamos que las cosas vayan a enviar mucho más
pronto de lo que pensamos.
2. Los beneficios se enumeran en español y en inglés.
3. Límites de las beneficios son, independientemente del idioma en el que
se elige (por ejemplo, hay seis en total disponible bajo los términos de internado
y practica, vamos a tratar de mantener los números actualizados sobre la base
de lo que se ha afirmado).
4. Nuestras camisetas y gorras de béisbol son únicos, diseñado y cosido
especialmente para nosotros en tiendas éticas con algodón orgánico. A
diferencia de la mayoría de las camisetas de producción masiva y goras,
éstos son únicos, y nuestro diseño no serán utilizados.


Riesgos Y Obstáculos


Riesgo: Que el cacao no produzca lo esperado y/o el
Mercado para cacao de alta calidad caiga.
Nuestro Método: Antes de que nuestros
agricultores participantes limpien sus chacras, nosotros estamos llevando a
cabo estudios para identificar y seleccionar variedades de alta calidad, de
alta producción, y resistentes. Estamos estudiando a fondo sus necesidades.
Estamos trabajando en estrecha colaboración con múltiples instituciones
peruanas, así como el USDA. Además, aunque el cacao será un foco, estamos trabajando
para crear un sistema mixto con una variedad de productos, tanto para el
consumo local y la exportación; si un mercado comienza a caer, los demás
productos estarán allí para ayudar a los agricultores.

Riesgo: Uno o varios de los miembros del equipo de
coordinación no pueden permanecer en su posición (por enfermedad, un cambio de
puestos de trabajo, accidente, o lo que usted quiera).
Nuestro Método: La gente cambia, las
circunstancias cambian, y la vida pasa. Con la idea de crear un proyecto sostenible
a largo plazo, ya estamos reclutando personas que pueden hacerse cargo de las
funciones de los miembros del equipo de coordinación (si habrá necesidad)
y que, mientras tanto, están profundizando y ampliando nuestra experiencia,
energía y redes.
Riesgo: Los cambios climáticos afectan a las
comunidades de una manera sin precedentes.
Nuestro Método: Esto ya está sucediendo,
y es uno de los impulsos de nuestro proyecto. A partir de la primera fase en el
proyecto, estamos incluyendo la investigación que se centra en la comprensión
de las formas en que los cambios climáticos están afectando a las comunidades,
las maneras en que pueden afectar a las comunidades, las formas en que las
comunidades se están adaptando con éxito, y las estrategias que podrían seguir.
Trabajaremos también con el nuevo esfuerzo para establecer un banco germplasma
de cacao en Iquitos, estaremos identificando variedades de cacao más capaces de
adaptarse a las circunstancias cambiantes.
Riesgo: Cambios en los tipos de cambio.
Nuestro Método: En el cálculo de nuestro
presupuesto, hemos utilizado un tipo de cambio un poco menos favorable (al
proyecto) que el promedio en los últimos años.

Conclusión

VASI, en
palabras de un profesor local, es una visión de la Amazonia que se propone
ayudar al mundo a vivir de una manera que sea económica, cultural, social,
espiritual y ecológicamente sostenible y que incluye y reconoce los derechos de
todas las personas. Esperamos que se unan a nosotros para apoyar este
emocionante proyecto.

Join us for the expansion of Bacon Boxes. </p><p>We are in a bit of a predicament. There is no hiding the fact that we have outgrown our kitchen. Many of you know that we are limited in space and if you do not submit your order early chances are we can’t provide. It breaks our heart just as much as it does yours. It’s time that we invest in the future of bacon. With your help we can eliminate our limitations, offer more products, offer quicker shipping times and impact our community economically and agriculturally.</p><h2><strong>OUR GOAL:</strong></h2><p>Bacon Boxes is in need of a larger and more equipped space. So far we have worked really hard to raise funding from sales and our goal is to raise a minimum of $100,000 from sales and crowdfunding. We’re stuck intermittently with a cramped workflow while running at capacity and a limitation to raise higher capital based on those two factors alone. </p><p>Our crowd funder is not all for fun and games. We mean business. It took a lot for us to conclude that this method of fund raising would be best for us. The co-founders, Kim and Logan, applied to receive a loan however with only being incorporated for a year it was found that Bacon Boxes does not qualify for private bank loans or SBA funding until completing two years of business. Instead of asking for handouts we have created incentive packages and teamed up with an artist to bring you the latest styles of bacon apparel in the hopes to meet and exceed our funding goals. Any proceeds raised over the cost of our buildout will be donated to a charity that supports responsible farming and advocates for small family owned farms. </p><h2>WHAT WE NEED:</h2><p><strong>1. Space </strong>(est. $2,500-2,800/M)</p><p>We currently work out of a 500 sq ft space and are able to cater to 200 orders a week.

Join us for the expansion of Bacon Boxes. We are in a bit of a predicament. There is no hiding the fact that we have outgrown our kitchen. Many of you know that we are limited in space and if you do not submit your order early chances are we can’t provide. It breaks our heart just as much as it does yours. It’s time that we invest in the future of bacon. With your help we can eliminate our limitations, offer more products, offer quicker shipping times and impact our community economically and agriculturally.OUR GOAL:Bacon Boxes is in need of a larger and more equipped space. So far we have worked really hard to raise funding from sales and our goal is to raise a minimum of $100,000 from sales and crowdfunding. We’re stuck intermittently with a cramped workflow while running at capacity and a limitation to raise higher capital based on those two factors alone. Our crowd funder is not all for fun and games. We mean business. It took a lot for us to conclude that this method of fund raising would be best for us. The co-founders, Kim and Logan, applied to receive a loan however with only being incorporated for a year it was found that Bacon Boxes does not qualify for private bank loans or SBA funding until completing two years of business. Instead of asking for handouts we have created incentive packages and teamed up with an artist to bring you the latest styles of bacon apparel in the hopes to meet and exceed our funding goals. Any proceeds raised over the cost of our buildout will be donated to a charity that supports responsible farming and advocates for small family owned farms. WHAT WE NEED:1. Space (est. $2,500-2,800/M)We currently work out of a 500 sq ft space and are able to cater to 200 orders a week. We aren't able to fit any more refrigeration which means we can't cure for additional orders or even think about offering new products. Having a space will open many doors. We're aiming to expand into a 1,700-2500 sq ft space. 2. Kitchen Equipment (est. $32,000)With the buildout of our own space we will be needing to purchase refrigerators, freezers, ovens, smokers, sinks, workstations and more! If you have any used equipment you're looking to get rid of please contact us. To keep the cost and environmental impact low we will be purchasing used, repurposed and refurbished. 3. Installation (est. $15,000-18,000)This budget is for small renovations, painting, plumbing, electrical, misc. upgrades and installation of the hood vent and grease traps.4. Misc. (est. $30,000)This budget is for hiring more team members, new product development, covering unforeseen complications, planning our grand opening celebration, organization, and marketing.   WHAT IS BACON BOXES?Bacon Roses. The claim to our wonderful fame.
