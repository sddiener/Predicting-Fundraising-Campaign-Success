<h3>Why Hair?...</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Pyeng Threadgill (pronounced<i> Py-ying</i>) and I am a vocalist and songwriter, performing and coaching in New York. I have been singing and performing since the age of 3 or 4 and I have always always been in love with words and music.</p>
<p>For the past several years I have been writing and researching to create a new multimedia project entitled <i>Head Full of Hair, Heart Full of Song</i>. <i>Head Full of Hair, Heart Full of Song</i> is a collection of songs, stories and videos exploring the notion of natural hair, ancestry and adornment for women African descent of all ages. This project looks at the inner and outer conflicts that arise for a young woman of African descent or woman of color when confronting oneself in a world that generally defines beauty from a European set of values.</p>
<p>Growing up African American and now having a teenage daughter myself I have witnessed how resourceful one has to be in order to counter many of the biased/disempowering images, limiting language and beliefs that are used everyday in our culture. </p>
<p>By pledging today your contributions will help in the rehearsing, recording, mixing, mastering, artwork and manufacturing for this full album! An album which I hope will be a modern resource for young women of all backgrounds to see and create themselves from <i>their own </i>vision.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to make this project a reality I am asking you to help me raise $20,000 with a flexible goal of $25, 000. Having made three records prior to this moment, I have experienced what it takes both financially and artistically to make a quality album with committed artists. This amount will go towards paying professional and committed musicians to fully learn, rehearse and co-arrange the music that I have written. Songs that range from stories of my maternal and paternal grandmothers to young teenage girls in South Africa protesting to be able wear their hair natural at school...in 2016!  I plan to use a total of 5 core musicians with a few special guests.</p>
<p>After a few small sharings to solidify our arrangements the music and stories will be recorded. So your contributions will compensate musicians and the engineer for their time in the studio. At this point I will be co-creating a visual experience that best reflects the intentions of these songs to convey the inner and outer beauty and challenges of African ancestry and hair with a dynamic photographer and a graphic designer. The last steps of music production will involve mixing/producing and mastering and finally pressing the completed project to a small amount of vinyl and cds as well as digital downloads.</p>
<p>Due to the complexity of Afro ancestry/identity and hair, video spoke to me as a means to convey thoughts and feelings around this layered topic. Your donations will also allow me to focus on filming and editing the last three video installations for this project. I have already had the time to gradually develop half of  the videos that are connected to <i>Head Full of Hair, Heart Full of Song</i>. With the help of my husband Nikolai Moderbacher crafting video camera rigs and backgrounds as well as often handling camera work, I have several videos completed. </p>
<p>Finally, you will be receiving a host of goodie bags or perks for joining me in this creative process. Contributors will receive anything from a digital copy of the album <i>Head Full of Hair</i> to my entire discography, which includes my first album <i>Sweet Home Chicago, The Music of Robert Johnson</i>, my first collection of original music released on cd <i>Of The Air</i> and my last recorded project <i>Portholes To A Love &amp; Other Short Stories </i>which won me a grant from <strong>New York Foundation for The Arts</strong> in Music Composition. Donators may also receive anything from to their name in the liner notes, to a special Posture Self-Care Package, to being the <strong><i>executive producer</i></strong> and more. </p>
<p>In the event that I am unable to reach my entire financial goal I still plan to complete the recording of this album releasing <i>Head Full of Hair</i> first digitally and postponing the vinyl pressing and additional video installations.  </p>
<h3>The Music Is The Magic...</h3>
</div><div>
<p>It has been nearly 10 years since I released my third solo album <i>Portholes To A Love &amp; Other Short Stories</i>. My first record <i>Sweet Home, The Music of Robert Johnson</i> earned me national and international exposure as well as many positive reviews including having ""put a novel spin on the Blues"" by <strong>Downbeat Magazine</strong>. While I have written a collection of environmental inspired music entitled <i>Songlines: Singing The Land </i> in the time since my last album, I chose not to go to the studio to record. I needed to rebuild my energy, raise my family and take care of my health. But NOW with <i>Head Full of Hair, Heart Full of Song</i> I really feel ready to share this project in a big way because it means that much to me. It <i>literally </i>pulls on me, like a child, to be completed.</p>
<p>Everyone needs a positive role model and our society needs a wide span of storytelling to represent the full range of experiences lived in this world . From slogans like ""Black Girl Magic"", to Solange's ""A Seat At The Table"" album, to a rise in women of African descent ""going natural"" and much more, even pop culture is seeking to re-envision what we want to say about race, gender and equality. Young women need to know that who they are and what they are feeling is acceptable and that many of our ancestors who came before us had valuable stories as well. That tight, curly hair is just as interesting, raveled, beautiful, messy, mysterious, misleading, and misunderstood as straight hair. </p>
<p>African/African American/Afro diasporic women and  young girls need safe centers to reflect and rejoice. Like Oshun, the Yoruban Goddess of beauty/fertility/music and art, looking in her mirror, we all seek to face ourselves and find peace. Any pledge you make to this project is a pledge towards reframing a part of our global history. Everyone needs a positive role model. Someone with stories and feelings and songs. Thank you for pledging to <i>Head Full of Hair, Heart Full of Song</i>.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div><div><p>I know everyone has a multitude of financial responsibilities and perhaps a limit to what you can donate towards. So while you may not be in a place to donate financially, if you would like to support this project, if it resonates with you, <i>please</i> do so but sharing this via Facebook, Twitter, Email, Instagram and even your own email blasts.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>My name is Toby Farrant, and I am a young entrepreneur. I started up Drumble around two years ago, with two business partners, which are both industry experts, and our goal is just to help and support struggling start up musicians, and potentially find the next big hit. </li>
<li>We came up with the idea for Band Hunt as a fun way to help start up musicians, and give them a platform to perform from. It also creates a healthy rivalry between universities, and gets anyone that does perform a lot of support from their backing university. </li>
<li>From your contributions, we will fund this competition, and create a social night in all your calendars that you will likely never forget. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need to raise around £50,000 to fund Band Hunt, because there is a massive list of things we need to do and pay for before the final. This includes venue, equipment, advertising, web development etc. </li>
<li>We are offering the opportunity to help name our winning trophy, and by doing so, you are also supporting your university, and any bands that wish to participate from that university. You also get the chance to win some cool tickets. </li>
<li>If we do not reach our full intended goal, we will attempt to create a much cheaper version of the whole competition, and still try to offer a unique experience if viable. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>This competition could be a massive opportunity for a lot of people, which may never have had the chance to stand up on stage and perform before. Our audience is very large, and will be a national event with professional judges through all events, and if they like what they see, it could go a long way. </li>
<li>Band Hunt is all a bit of fun, but for some, it is a serious opportunity, and one that we would very much like to give to anybody that is interested. We are hoping to run this competition year on year, to help and support as many musicians as possible. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Luckily, I have the support of two very experienced business partners which have toured with some of the largest musicians in the world, and with their experience, and my business knowledge, I believe that I can make this competition a reality and live up to the expectations that you all may have of the event. </li>
<li>Alongside my business partners, we have some very good contacts, which will help us to create Band Hunt. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul><li>If you can't contribute, we would appreciate any help sharing this will all your friends, and it is so easy to do so with Indiegogo share tools. </li></ul>
<h3>First round</h3>
<ul><li>There are three stages to our competition. A first stage knock out round. A semi final and a final.</li></ul>
<p>The rules are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any UK university is welcome to participate.</li>
<li>The video must be no longer than five minutes long.</li>
<li>All genres and all types of musicians and performing artists are allowed.</li>
<li>One participants from the band must be a student currently studying at the university of submission.</li>
<li>Any video that does not follow these rules will still be allowed to be featured on our website, but will however, unfortunately have to be disqualified from the competition. </li>
</ul>
<p>The first stage is where all participating bands from each university will film a video, no longer than five minutes of them performing a song together as a band. All and any genres are allowed. Any video that does not follow these rules will be disqualified. It will be made very clear exactly how each band should upload their video onto our website. It is encouraged that members of the bands seek help from other students that study film/photography/music to complete their video. There will be another cutoff point, and any band that has not uploaded their music to our website will be disqualified from judging for the semi-finals. After this cutoff point, the acts will be judged by industry experts, and the best will be featured and shown in our TV shows. The judges will choose the top 25 bands to carry into the next stage, so competition could be very high. The bands will be judged by the quality of music, stage presence, and the amount of views and votes they receive from the website.</p>
<h3>Semi-final</h3>
<ul><li>The semi-final will be held in a studio, with all remaining bands left in the competition. There will be 25 bands remaining, competing for a prize for themselves and the band, and as well as a trophy to the winning university to showcase. Again, this will be judged by industry experts, and judged on the same criteria. Judges will eliminate the number of bands to just 8, which will go into the final.</li></ul>
<h3>Final</h3>
<ul><li><p>The final will be the last 8 bands remaining, and whoever wins this will win a prize for themselves, as well as a trophy for their university that they represent.

<h3>Brume!</h3>
<p>Brume is a very talented gal who's been hiding! Why? Brume was in the middle of a singer songwriter world that was mostly made up of the genre's like folk, blues, and blue grass.  Now Brume has no problem singing and enjoying with other artist of this genre, in fact she has lended her talents by way of singing on her friends songs.  ""It Gets me Down"" by Liza Marie Sparks of the SF Bay Area for one.</p>
<p>Angela comes from a Mexican American heritage, growing up loving all kinds of music.  But her love for Indie Rock, and British Pop she feels is outside the norm for the area she lived in and had to quietly enjoy the music, until she started doing open mic in and around the Bay Area.  </p>
<p>She started recording her ideas and throwing her songs up onto Soundcloud.  There, tiny bits of gems were laying, waiting patiently to get polished into sparkling gems and we are excited to be a part of it! Aren't you!  Music so sweet with a rock edge! </p>
<p>A friend helped her develop one of the songs on to Soundcloud and the producer in LA, Chris Wirsig of the famous band no:carrier and of Counter Communications heard it and started to experiment with her song.  Just a few conversations later and the Indiegogo campaign is born to <strong>help</strong> <i><strong>BRUME GET TO LA for her RECORDING ADVENTURE!!!</strong></i></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>FUNDS! Tons of Funds... well the amount we are asking for...</p>
<p>What do you get? The music, the paintings, the updates!!!  Did I tell you Brume is one heck of an artist? Paint, pen, brush? That kind of artist?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Oh, and that three different lucky people will get the  paintings for the a $500 donation? and one large painting and oh and a HOUSE CONCERT!!!</p>
<p>Brume is asking for <strong>$7435.16 </strong>- <strong><i>exact numbers</i></strong> of what we need, <i><strong>but a little more for fees would help so $7500 total!  </strong></i>Because we are determined on getting her there, keeping her safe, fed, relaxed and rehearsed! It would also help in case Brume needed to rent any instruments  while down there to.  Brume's team will be hard at work filming and updating her Adventure as she goes!  <i><strong>Make sure to follow the link to her blog</strong></i>!  Her team will  be making sure all is prepped for distribution, so the CD's will come in time for signing!  </p>
<p>The house concert will be <strong>limited to the SF Bay Area</strong>.  <strong>Did you know</strong> Brume is <strong><i>bilingual</i></strong>?  </p>

Music is my lifework and I have created many songs and albums. But more recently, for over 10 years, I was in horrible physical pain and it was a struggle making music, and even just living. I could hardly walk. It was awful. Then a transformation happened. And I felt like I experienced a medical and metaphysical miracle. Learn more by viewing this short documentary story of Metamorphosis.Being well again, I feel such a deep sense of gratitude I want to give something back, share, and inspire, create hope, and even heal thru music.I used my savings to produce the Metamorph's ""The Wave"" single and music video.An international adventure with filming in Costa Rica, Australia and the US. And a family project with both my grown beautiful daughters and 101 year old friend who is still dancing! Some very talented people from the community volunteered their time to make the first two Metamorph music videos possible. Thank you to Lazarina Todorova, Z Boyd Stout, Julifer Day, Morgana Rose, Eileen Kramer, Ari Karma, Kellen Corkill, Nyiko Beguin, Acezat, Fabrice Renaudin, Michal Ben Moshe, Eva Dalak, Naida Moon, Hannah Dyson, Rosario Lill, Shannon Ross.   ""Fire Monkey"" is the second single and video in the Metamorph 4 Elements series.

Please help us make the  ""Wings"" music video even better. “Wings” is about using pain, suffering, and struggle, to change and fly.

Heartbreak is my gunpowder, I am shooting for the stars, love flies and wounds, I have wings and claws..."".

The reason for this fundraiser is because as much as I may want to continue and make the Wings video, I don't have the funds.

<h3>Who we are:</h3>
<p>We are Youngest of Elders, an indie/alternative band from the San Francisco Bay Area. We've been working hard on our debut full-length album for the last year, and we need your help finishing it!</p>
<p>In just eighteen months, we've gone from a solo project to a full four-piece band playing with such acts as Anthony Ranieri (of Bayside), Tiny Stills, Bad Pop, Oleander, and many more. We've all been in bands for a long time, and know all too well that paying for any recording or merchandise out of pocket is always a financial and mental pain. With all of the success crowdfunding has been over the last few years, we thought we'd try it out and hope fellow musicians, friends, family, and fans both new and old could help out.</p>
<p><strong>What we want to do:</strong></p>
<p>We want to raise enough money with our campaign to produce a radio and CD-ready debut album that's guaranteed to let everyone know who Youngest of Elders is, can do, and wants to get done musically.</p>
<p>The total estimated cost of the release is $2500, which covers the recording, mixing, mastering, and CD duplication costs. We’ll be working once again with The Canvas Group, a San Francisco Bay Area-based production team, for the duration of the project, who I've worked with previously for our last release, ""ASL"". All funds raised for the campaign, whether it be more or less than our goal, will go to making our dream of releasing our first album a wonderful reality.</p>

<h3>The Lowdown</h3>
<p>Red Mesa is an Albuquerque, NM based desert rock band.  The band was formed in 2013.  The band has been playing live since 2014. They have released 1 full length album and 1 EP split most recently 2016's <i>SECOND COMING OF HEAVY VOL.4 </i>released on Ripple Music label.  The Obelisk wrote of the EP ""a genuine mini-album"" and ""somewhere between a vocalized Karma to Burn and Kyuss"".</p>
<p>After an up and down 2017, where the band saw two of its original band members leave, principal songwriter and founder, Brad Frye started writing a record.  <i>The Devil and The Desert</i> is more personal and heavy than previous Red Mesa records.  But by no means is this a solo record.  The songs are hazy and beautiful like desert sunset.  The melodies are catchy, errie, and haunting.  The guitars are dirty and effect-drenched to capture the desert environment. We know you are going to love it.  And we can all feel a little pride together about making this a reality.  </p>
<p>So, we are just asking for you to order this record in advance.  We will be pressing 250 copies.  They are going to go fast, there's nothing to lose.  Let's do this!</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Most of the record has been recorded, mixed, and mastered.  What we need help with is the funds for production of the vinyl LP and costs to cover merch and PR work to help with the release of the record.  </p>
<p>We're asking for 4000 as a goal.  Approximately 2000 is going to the production of the vinyl and jackets and artwork. and the rest will go to merch production and PR.  This will help ""The Devil and The Desert"" reach national press.  </p>
<p>All contribution levels will include a pre-release digital download, and the second tier and above will include either a copy of the new vinyl record, killer new ""The Devil and The Desert"" merch, or both!</p>
<p>Donating above and beyond will get you some awesome other prizes like an album artwork print by the album's artist Joe Vollan or a free Red Mesa show and more.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>The Record</strong></h3>
<p>This is an ambitious record.  There is no record label backing on this album, hence we need your help. </p>
<p>With Brad not having his original band members, Matthew Tobias at Empty House Studio has worked directly with Brad to get the songs to come alive, and to add to the Red Mesa catalogue.  Matthew brought in a few top Albuquerque studio musicians to help with bass and lap steel, and additional guitars.  Matthew himself laid down drums.  Brad wrote, sang, and played guitars and lead.  </p>
<p>The album will have two sides.  Side A being the more deserty and atmospheric side, with excellent songwriting and Side B bringing the heavy riffs and power. This album grows and weaves through stories and sounds.  </p>
<p>Side A:</p>
<p>1) Devil Come Out To Play</p>
<p>2) The Devil's Coming Round</p>
<p>3) Springtime in the Desert</p>
<p>4) Desert Sol</p>
<p>Side B: </p>
<p>....To be announced soon!</p>
</div><div> </div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't give money, but still love Red Mesa, please help spread the word to any and all friends, family, co-workers, and music lovers.  We'll be very grateful for your efforts.  </p>

<h3>Toni Bergins</h3>
<p>Hi!  I'm Toni. My goal is to create a wave of inspiration where people learn to love themselves, connect with their joy and find their personal power! <strong> I really need your help in getting my music out there!</strong> <strong>I want to impact young people and inspire all listeners to remember that they matter! </strong>I'm a dancer, singer-songwriter, workshop facilitator, founder of JourneyDance™. I've also created the Embodied Transformations Method for personal growth and development.  For the last 20 years I have used movement and expression to help people get into their bodies, heal from past traumas that impact their lives, and find joy.  We move into a new story. </p>
<p>As I work with people, I find such a range of sadness and joy in the world.  I sing and write music  to release my own emotions and connect with people's stories.  Almost every song on this upcoming debut album was written in response to emotions I needed to express or stories I needed to share.  My title track Never Too Late was written to inspire those who feel they have lost their dreams, or that the pain of their past holds them back from fully living.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523508367/gplanojicrw9ljlfhklm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Two years ago I began sharing my music publicly during workshops and at open mic events.  I got wonderfully positive responses and someone generously introduced me to my producer Jason Samonik.  We immediately clicked and became writing and musical partners.  He took my folky guitar songs and my piano ballads and turned them into epic musical pieces.</p>
<p>It's been a challenging process to uplevel my work and jump deeper into sharing my voice and message. For me, the voice is my most vulnerable place to share myself.  I'm pushing myself to my edge recording these songs, performing them and deciding to share them with the public.</p>
<p>This campaign is to help raise money for producing and completing this long-awaited project.  It's been a labor of love!  I just finished writing the last song for the album, Made From Love, about how my divorce impacted my sons.  I know many people will relate to it.  With your help, I can get these messages out into the mainstream!</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Recording and production is a costly and totally worthwhile adventure.  I've loved every minute of it!  I've also spent a ton of my own personal money on this labor of love and I now need to raise funds to complete paying my producer to bring these songs to life. What I've learned is that it really takes 100s of hours to produce an amazing track with all the layers of today's music.  Recording is the easy part.  Hours in the studio laying down instrument tracks and creating a sound and feel takes the longest!  I'm hoping to raise enough for 50-100 more hours in the studio and completion of the first album.</p>
<p>You can probably tell I love connecting with people.  Your donation means so much to me because you will become a part of this project and getting it out to the world!!  I've created a bunch of perks as my way of saying thank you for your generous contributions.  There are even a few perks where we can connect directly, like songwriting workshops.</p>
<p>The goal I selected will allow me to complete a full CD of 11 songs.  If I don't reach my full goal, I will use the funds I do raise to work on as many tracks as I can and release them as singles. </p>

<p>Even if you aren't able to contribute financially, your support means so much to me.  This is such an emotional journey and every person's energetic contribution helps the momentum of this project.  Please:<strong>  Share this campaign with friends and others who might be moved by this music!</strong><strong>  Look for my songs and videos on Spotify, iTunes and YouTube!</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>I'm all about Impact!</p>
<p><i>When you donate to this project you will be helping share positive messages given to the world through music.  </i>Each song stands for something that I feel strongly people need to hear.  A few of the songs are pop and fun to dance to, but the lyrics are meant for something greater.  Like when you listen to music to help you feel and release, I want this for others.</p>
<p>I am still nervous when I perform. I am still nervous about what kind of response I will get when my music is ""out there"". But I know I must do it and that if can do it, I can inspire so many other wonderful people to live their dreams!</p>

<h3>Help Sue Bachner and Ether Park record a new EP</h3>
<p>Hi all, </p>
<p>I'm Sue Bachner. If you're reading this, it's possible you know me from my past recordings with my band Ether Park, or from tracks I've had on compilation albums on Zero Hour Records the last couple of years. <a href=""https://zerohouraustralia.bandcamp.com/music"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://zerohouraustralia.bandcamp.com/music</a></p>
<p>Or maybe you've seen the video for my song ""Where's Jeffrey"" on youtube.  </p>
<div>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/JHq3LRKp6EY?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Perhaps you've stumbled onto this page in the course of an intense google search for an affordable place to purchase some ether. I'm not judging, but I can't help you with that. Still, please check out the rest of my story, the ether will still be there 10 minutes from now. (Unless it evaporates; I remember very little about chemistry from high school.) </div>

<p>My goal is to crowdfund an EP of 5 songs ( listed below), with the ""perks"" being pre-paid downloads of the eventual completed tracks, PLUS some fun extras. </p>
<p>I've tentatively titled the project ""Happy Landings"" because I think a lot of us feel the world is sort of up in the air right now. Maybe putting the EP out will encourage some solid ""happy landing"" energy for my friends, and listeners. But I need $2500 for liftoff!

<p>A lot of my songs are about real life issues many people think about. Here's a list of the probable songs I will record.: </p>
<p> <strong>""Happy Now""</strong>: about the decision to put a child up for adoption </p>
<p> <strong>""Theme For The Day""</strong>: about a person trying to find a ""theme"" or point to life while being unemployed. </p>
<p><strong>""Money Up, Money Down""</strong>: about a whole country trying to find a ""theme"" or point to life while being unemployed. ( Hmm, I think I sense a theme here, after all, and it's chronic unemployment.) </p>
<p><strong>""I'm Not Your Fan""</strong> : about trying to crawl out from under the weight of your friends' big fat creative egos. ( No, it's not about me. I'm a very humble, down to earth person. Probably.)</p>
<p><strong>""According to Mary""</strong>: kind of 21st century version of ""The Gospel of Mary"" from the Gnostic Gospels in song. <a href=""http://gnosis.org/library/marygosp.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">gnosis.org/library/marygosp.htm</a>  ( OK maybe a lot of people don't necessarily think about that, but it's good to switch things up a little once in a while!) </p>
<p>Here's a video of a me doing a live, acoustic version of ""Money Up, Money Down"" just to give you a sample of one of the songs. ( The video was part of an animated web series at the time called ""Explosion Bus"" <a href=""http://www.explosionbus.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.explosionbus.com</a>  In the video, I'm supposed to be auditioning for a fictional traveling talent show.

Hi all, 
I'm Sue Bachner. If you're reading this, it's possible you know me from my past recordings with my band Ether Park, or from tracks I've had on compilation albums on Zero Hour Records the last couple of years. https://zerohouraustralia.bandcamp.com/music
Or maybe you've seen the video for my song ""Where's Jeffrey"" on youtube.  


 
Perhaps you've stumbled onto this page in the course of an intense google search for an affordable place to purchase some ether. I'm not judging, but I can't help you with that. Still, please check out the rest of my story, the ether will still be there 10 minutes from now. (Unless it evaporates; I remember very little about chemistry from high school.)

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! We’re Names Without Numbers. Since originally forming in the summer of 2000 we’ve released an EP and a full-length album, toured the Midwest, played in venues ranging from basements to festivals, slept on floors and in barns (true story), and enjoyed meeting tons of cool people along the way. </p>
<p>In 2006 we decided to take a break. Since then we’ve all started families, added to our already impressive collection of tattoos, Dave fractured his skull and almost died (his brain is fine now…at least as much as it ever was), shook the dust off in 2009 for a reunion show, and then resumed our rock and roll hibernation. </p>
<p>Fast forward to 2018…WE’RE BACK! We came out of retirement, woke up from our hibernation like a bunch of hungry bears…hungry to write new, bold, passionate music. We have already begun writing and recording new songs, but we need your help to finish the project. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>There are a lot of expenses that go into a recording project; studio time, mixing the record, mastering, artwork, advertising, and a ton of other things. So, we’re asking for you to consider helping us fund the project. </p>
<p>We’ve decided to work with our friend and producer Michael King on the album.  Mike’s worked with groups like Mainstay, Undying Anthem, Epic Hero, CP Worship, and is also a published writer. In addition, we’ve brought in Grammy Award-winning mixing engineer J.R. McNeely. Some of his credits include Anberlin, Emery, Demon Hunter, Relient K, Underoath, and Acceptance. </p>
<p>The $10,000 goal is a very conservative number compared to what it might actually cost to make this the best it can be. It's not just a financial commitment, but it's also very time consuming. This means spending time away from family, long hours in the studio, meeting with graphic designers, producers, writing sessions, etc.  </p>
<p>If we don't meet the goal, the project will still happen, but we might have to cut some corners! That means less songs, less advertising, and less time perfecting the songs to make them the best they can be. We want you to have MORE, not less. If we meet, or go above and beyond the goal, that will only mean one thing…more rad perks for you, the fan and listener! We’ll be able to record more songs, have better production, artwork, and many other things. The more we raise, the more we can make this an album you’ll really enjoy. </p>
<p>There are several different levels of funding you can choose from, and each one has special perks that come with it. As a bonus, <strong>everyone who donates will get a download of the brand new, un-released song, THE APATHY ANTHEM. </strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We’re not asking for money just so we can have fun and record some songs. We’re asking for you to help us impact lives through music. It has always been our goal as a band to write thought provoking songs that help the listener in whatever situation they’re in. At the same time, we want our songs to be fun, catchy, and something you can bob your head to and sing along with. </p>
<p>We feel these new songs are the best material we’ve ever written. I’m sure every band says that, but really, this stuff has us very excited! So, in the words of one of our favorite bands, Jimmy Eat World, we need you to “Kick start our rock &amp; roll heart.” </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand some people can't contribute financially, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>
<p>·SOCIAL MEDIA. This is huge. Share, share, share. Use the Indiegogo social media share tools, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter…whatever you got.</p>
<p>·Tell your friends, neighbors, mom, dad, your doctor, your lawyer, church, youth group, your bridge club, anyone you can think of. Word of mouth is a great tool. </p>
<p><strong>Whatever resources you have, use them. Start making some serious noise about this campaign! </strong></p>

Lilac Wine - written by James Shelton (lyrics and music) in 1950 and made famous by Nina Simone in 1966.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Vaureen is Andrea, Marianne and Cale. For over 2 years, the three of us have worked on this record while facing some significant challenges brought on by life-changes. We pushed forward because of how much music means to each of us individually, and how sincerely we want to share with others. We're deeply grateful to all who have helped us make it this far!</p>
<p>Our 10-song album is all ready to go, and we need your help to give the music the best release possible! After all, if it weren't for you out there supporting us and watching us grow, it would mean nothing.</p>
<p>With your generous support, we will:</p>
<ul>
<li>cover months of production, mixing and mastering</li>
<li>press collectible vinyl</li>
<li>hire a music promotion company to release the music</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our funding goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Goal #1</strong> – $10,000: We emptied our bank accounts to cover studio time, engineering, mixing and mastering! It was worth it to nail the recording process and produce the grungy, sludgy album of our dreams.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Goal #2</strong> – $13,000: We need to deliver a killer physical product: collectible vinyl! Music fans today still value having a physical album to hold in their hands, and we’ve got a custom design prepared that will make eyes and ears happy!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Goal #3</strong> – $16,000: We need a music promotion firm to get our music heard on the radio, place stories in blogs and papers, and to help share “Extraterra” with a larger audience. Typically a three-month engagement.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Goal #4 </strong>– $18,000+: any money we raise past $16k will go toward professional music videos.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Cool stuff for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>First Listen - hear the music before anyone else!</li>
<li>Swag - pins and tees</li>
<li>Autographed Collectible Vinyl</li>
<li>Album Credits - let your kindness be immortalized in vinyl</li>
<li>Framed Artwork - something special and unique created by Andrea</li>
<li>A live performance video of cover song of your choice, like this one:</li>

<div> </div>
<div>Everything helps. But if we don't reach our goal, we'll still be able to release the music digitally.</div>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Nothing brings us more joy than to hear that someone has been moved by a Vaureen song. So far, we've received praise from all over the world! It's been a kind of life-line for us. Connecting with people through our music has brought us the understanding that we're not alone, and compels us to move forward. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We've spent all our extra time and money making this record. Fans from all over the world have been waiting a long time to hear a follow-up to our Violence EP. One of the biggest risks we face is disappointing our fanbase. Dedication to our fans is a driving force - and if we can't deliver the goods in one year, we'll just have to take more time.</p>

<p>STRUGGLE SESSION is a hardcore band living in Beijing, China and consists of members from the USA, Canada, and Australia.  Struggle Session is touring South America (Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Columbia, and Panama) in June-July of 2018.  After our last tour and consequently, making our last tour documentary, we noticed the power of sharing videos of local scenes and its capacity for networking, promoting music from local scenes and sharing it internationally, and the reinforcing and encouraging effect it had on musicians worldwide.  Although we live in China, this documentary acts as a way to celebrate, encourage, and support musicians all over the world to reach out, share music, and get touring!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If there are any excess proceeds, half will go towards paying for editing and off-setting costs of the tour and half towards a local charity in China.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We need your help with getting the documentary made!  Our last tour only consisted of 8 shows in Morocco and Spain, and it took us months before it was ready to release.  This time, we will be playing 34 shows in 36 days, and we would like to bring a professional videographer with us, whose job will be to film and help us with editing and production.   Our goal is to raise $2,500 - $3,000 to cover part of their flights to Brazil and cover some of the fees for time that they will spend on editing and production.</p>

We've played in electric house parties, raved it up busking on the streets and taken our crazy sound to festivals all over the UK. We've created an original live score for the play Oct.O.Pus and even provided music for <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWeyUpqnKuk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">cartoons</a> that have featured on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbS9lD3x07Q"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Adult Swim</a>. We've recorded an <i><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/ask-my-bull/sets/ask-my-bull-ep"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">EP</a></i> and carved out our own particular niche in the amazing Manchester DIY creative scene. <i>Now its time to solidify these achievements by making a full length album.</i></p><p>We are a strong unit where individual difference is celebrated but everyone is working together for the sake of the music. If you've seen us at gigs you will know that we play as one! One of the main reasons we need to make this album is to finally have recordings that <i>feature all of the current members.</i> The Ask My Bull EP is 3 years old now and we have <i>evolved significantly</i> in the meantime. Its time to have something available that <i>really sounds like us!</i><br/><br/>This album cannot be thrown together quickly on borrowed time. If it is to be worth making, the album has to <i>capture the energy of our live performances</i>. This is no mean feat! As such, we've been working tirelessly to perfect the songs. However, this is only half the battle – we cannot compromise on sound quality. We need a good old fashioned <i>recording studio</i>, to tap into the sonic power of our musical past and create the most <i>immense sound</i> we can.<br/><br/>Your support will help us <i>work with the right people</i> in the right places to transform our work into a <i>life-size musical creature</i>. <strong>We believe that with a recording that truly represents the energy and passion we play with, we'll be able to take the next step and convince anyone who will listen that we are a musical force for the future.</strong> Its time to level-up!</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551038137/okd6dighvx4uldotiwma.jpg"" src=""""/></h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need</h3><p>Putting this album together has been a steep learning curve for all of us. Here is a rough and incomplete breakdown of what we need to make this project a success. We've included some estimated costs but we're still working it out! </p><p><u>Recording</u>  ~ £ 6,000</p><p>Not only do we need approximately 18 days of studio time (£ 2,650), we'll be working with producer extraordinaire <a href=""https://www.lukeclarkeproducer.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Luke Clarke</a> who will engineer and mix the record (£ 2,805). To keep the sound quality at maximum, we'll need plenty of fresh strings, drum skins and sax reeds (£ 250). Once the we have the recording mixed, we'll also need to master it (£ 300).</p><p><u>Merchandise</u>  ~ £ 800</p><p>We will of course be making CDs, and making the album available online (~ £ 300). We also want to make a killer T-shirt/vest/thing and, of course, some stickers to spread the word (~ £ 500).</p><p><u>Launch Night</u> ~ £ 700</p><p>We'll be working with <a href=""http://www.gadzooksevents.com/events/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gadzooks</a> to try and make the launch a night to remember. If you were at our <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2KV-HPh5Ng"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">sold-out EP launch</a> you'll know how raucous it can get! We want to hire a sick venue (£ 400) and set the scene with decorations, lighting and projectors. Then there is of course the sound engineer, support acts and DJs, all of whom also need payment (~ £ 300).</p><p><u>Media/Marketing/Art</u>  ~ £ 1,400</p><p>We've already begun working with <a href=""https://www.thesamsaracollective.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Samsara Collective</a> to revamp our online presence and get some crisp new photos. For the photoshoot itself we had help with make-up and art direction from our talented friends.

We've played in electric house parties, raved it up busking on the streets and taken our crazy sound to festivals all over the UK. We've created an original live score for the play Oct.O.Pus and even provided music for cartoons that have featured on Adult Swim. We've recorded an EP and carved out our own particular niche in the amazing Manchester DIY creative scene. Now its time to solidify these achievements by making a full length album.We are a strong unit where individual difference is celebrated but everyone is working together for the sake of the music. If you've seen us at gigs you will know that we play as one! One of the main reasons we need to make this album is to finally have recordings that feature all of the current members. The Ask My Bull EP is 3 years old now and we have evolved significantly in the meantime. Its time to have something available that really sounds like us!This album cannot be thrown together quickly on borrowed time. If it is to be worth making, the album has to capture the energy of our live performances. This is no mean feat! As such, we've been working tirelessly to perfect the songs. However, this is only half the battle – we cannot compromise on sound quality. We need a good old fashioned recording studio, to tap into the sonic power of our musical past and create the most immense sound we can.Your support will help us work with the right people in the right places to transform our work into a life-size musical creature. We believe that with a recording that truly represents the energy and passion we play with, we'll be able to take the next step and convince anyone who will listen that we are a musical force for the future. Its time to level-up! What We NeedPutting this album together has been a steep learning curve for all of us. Here is a rough and incomplete breakdown of what we need to make this project a success. We've included some estimated costs but we're still working it out! Recording  ~ £ 6,000Not only do we need approximately 18 days of studio time (£ 2,650), we'll be working with producer extraordinaire Luke Clarke who will engineer and mix the record (£ 2,805). To keep the sound quality at maximum, we'll need plenty of fresh strings, drum skins and sax reeds (£ 250). Once the we have the recording mixed, we'll also need to master it (£ 300).Merchandise  ~ £ 800We will of course be making CDs, and making the album available online (~ £ 300). We also want to make a killer T-shirt/vest/thing and, of course, some stickers to spread the word (~ £ 500).Launch Night ~ £ 700We'll be working with Gadzooks to try and make the launch a night to remember. If you were at our sold-out EP launch you'll know how raucous it can get! We want to hire a sick venue (£ 400) and set the scene with decorations, lighting and projectors. Then there is of course the sound engineer, support acts and DJs, all of whom also need payment (~ £ 300).Media/Marketing/Art  ~ £ 1,400We've already begun working with The Samsara Collective to revamp our online presence and get some crisp new photos. For the photoshoot itself we had help with make-up and art direction from our talented friends. Very soon we'll be commissioning a music video and album artwork. We are excited to be working with all these amazing creative people and your support now allows us to do this and treat them fairly. What You GetSo, we've come up with some 'perks'. Not only are these cool ways for you to support the album, but they're a way that we can give something unique back. We've tried to price things as well as we can so you are really getting more than your money's worth. As you'd expect we've got various bundle combinations of CDs, T-shirts, Launch Tickets and the like. There is some pretty unique stuff there too, but let us just highlight one in particular...Feature on the RecordAs part of trying to capture the energy of our live shows we need some of you to come and make some crazy noises with us. Screaming, shouting, babbling, chanting and even some good old fashioned singing; lets all get together and go mental in a room!  We would also love it if you could reprise your role at the album launch itself and shout along in the right places (shouting in the wrong places is also encouraged). CommunityWe feel amazingly lucky to be part of a thriving DIY scene here in Manchester.

We have made an incredible record. But we could use your help in covering the climbing costs of this production.</p><p><strong>The Story</strong></p><p>Pinto Bennett is an Idaho music legend. His unique take on classic country songwriting along with his powerful performances have earned him loyal fans from Boise to Nashville to London. He has shared bills in the U.K. with Willie and Waylon. Harland Howard was a drinking buddy. Emmylou Harris babysat his child.  After performing around the world for decades, Pinto eventually made his way back to Idaho where he currently resides. He still performs occasionally for fans of all ages. </p><p>I'm Jason Beek, producer of <i>The Last Saturday Night</i>. I've been touring around the world for the last dozen years as a drummer and manager for my wife, Eilen Jewell. I also host a radio program called Spoonful on Radio Boise which features classic country, old blues, rockabilly, gospel and old rock 'n' roll. I share a birthday with Hank Williams Sr. I don’t listen to much music made before 1972. Music is my life. With all of this in mind, you can see how easy it was to fall hard for Pinto's music. </p><p>I'm admittedly new to the Pinto party. About 2 years ago, my friend and fellow drummer Michael Rundle invited me to watch him perform with Pinto at the 44 Club in Boise. Pinto's original songs blew me away. I was floored. ""Winnemucca"", ""You Cared Enough To Lie"", ""Stranger in the Mirror""...so many amazing tunes. Eilen and I began attending the shows at the 44 Club religiously. It wasn't long before I was filling-in on the drums at the 44 and Pinto and I became friends.</p><p><strong>Making a Record</strong></p><p>About a year ago I asked Pinto about re-recording some of his popular tunes to reflect his current approach and vibe. He said, ""Hell man, I already recorded those songs. I have drawers full of new songs."" Ok, I thought. Pinto Bennett wants to make a record of new songs. Someone needs to make this happen. So, Eilen and I decided we would take some money we had squirreled away and make a new Pinto Bennett record. </p><p>Obviously this project has been a labor of love. Over the course of many weeks we worked hard to get the songs out of Pinto's kitchen and into the world beyond. We eventually assembled a band of long-time friends who Pinto loves and who he has been working with at the 44 for the last couple of years. I can't say enough about the hard work and dedication given to this project by Brett Dewey (mandolin, vocals), Jake Hoffman (pedal steel), Bill Parsons (upright bass) and Dale Wilson (electric guitar). Together we spent many hours shaping the tunes that appear on this record. All of the work has been for the love of Pinto Bennett and his music. Guitarist Jerry Miller and multi-instrumentalist and engineer Steve Fulton added musical magic that glued the sound together. Eilen Jewell added background vocals.</p><p><b>Help Us Release <i>The Last Saturday Night</i></b></p><p>Again, so far <i>The Last Saturday Night</i> has been funded entirely by my wife Eilen Jewell and me. There is no label or agency or group backing us. We have been happy to do it, but we also have some realistic goals for this record release. Having a boost from Pinto's fans would help us realize those goals.</p><p><strong>Costs So Far Include: </strong></p><ul>
<li>Recording and mixing of the album over several days at AudioLab in Garden City, Idaho</li>
<li>Mastering by Yes Master Studios in Nashville, TN</li>
<li>Painted portrait by Javier Vega (Madrid, Spain) for the album cover</li>

</ul><p><strong>Future Goals for <i>The Last Saturday Night</i></strong>:</p><ul>
<li>We would love for <i>The Last Saturday Night</i> to have a <strong>small publicity campaign </strong>in the hopes of capturing a few good reviews and getting spins on college and community radio. We’re hoping to reach a larger audience of potential fans as well as trying to reach as many Pinto Bennett fans as possible to let them know about <i>The Last Saturday Night</i>. </li>
<li>While the album is on its way to the CD duplication house, we’re also hoping to raise funds for <strong>a vinyl release of <i>The Last Saturday Night</i></strong>. I know there are some audiophiles out there like myself who prefer the beauty of analog LPs over CDs. With luck, we’ll raise enough to make a vinyl release happen.</li>

<li>There are several perks available for contributing to this project that you will find right on this page. Obviously we have <strong>CDs</strong> available as well as <strong>signed CDs</strong> at a slightly higher level.</li>
<li>We are hopeful that enough fans will choose to buy <strong>vinyl records </strong>(signed or not) for us to release this album on LP in early 2019.</li>
<li>There are 50 <strong>limited edition prints of the original album artwork signed by Pinto</strong> available.</li>
<li>One lucky person can own <strong>the original portrait of Pinto by Javier Vega</strong>. Javier is a very talented artist and also an Eilen Jewell fan from Madrid, Spain. He was the first artist I thought of to create the album cover portrait. I was thrilled he could work with us.</li>
<li>
<strong>Pinto's original hand-written and signed song lyrics </strong>are also available as a perk for backing this project. These are the road maps the band followed to create these tunes. You can't get much closer to the roots of these songs than holding these sheets of paper.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Join Us</strong></p><p>Help us make the release of <i>The Last Saturday Night</i> as good as it possibly can be.  According to the man himself, this is the last album for Pinto Bennett, our guy, your pard’, the Idaho Cowboy, the honky tonk ass-hole pickin’ up cans for a bottle.

<h3>Our Campaign</h3>
<p>DCAST Music is a label committed to raising awareness about women's empowerment &amp; promoting gender equality. We pledge to partner with local non-profits and give half of all our profits to them.  This campaign we are supporting the East Los Angeles Women's Center and their Men's Circle Program!  This is a violence prevention program that promotes positive masculinity, healthy relationships, and respect for women. In promotion of our up and coming album <strong>I'm a Beautiful Mess</strong>, we are selling t-shirts and committing to give the ELAWC half of all the profits. Buy the t-shirt and be a part of supporting programs that help empower women.  Welcome to the movement...we've been waiting for you.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why are we doing this?</h3>
<p>Welcome to the Movement.  Partner with us.  Empower Women.</p>
<p><u>Violence against women is real</u></p>
<p>1 in 3 women have been physically abused by an intimate partner.  1 in 5 women in the U.S. has been raped in their lifetime.  Help us support Domestic (Intimate) Partner and Sexual Assault Centers.</p>
<p><u>Lack of women in Leadership</u></p>
<p>In 2014, women were just 20 percent of executives, senior officers, and management in US high-tech industries.  In medicine, they comprise 37% of all physicians and surgeons.  Only 29% of women are executives and senior level managers.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p>Over the next 60 days we want to raise <strong>$5,000</strong>.  Half of our profits will go straight to the East Los Angeles Women's Center and their ""Men's Circle"" program.  The other half we use to develop more music projects and to hopefully run more campaigns like this in the future.  With your purchase you help us be apart of the solution. Welcome to the Movement.  Partner with us. Empower women. </p>

<p>-Gender equality</p>
<p>-Positive Masculinity</p>
<p>-Objectification and how to stop it</p>
<p>-Healthy Relationships</p>
<p>-What is gender based violence?</p>
<p>-Coping skills (for sadness, hurt, fear, loss)</p>
<p>-Expression and communication of emotions</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Any Risks?</b></p>
<p>There are always some risks and challenges involved in pulling off a project, mostly anticipated from printing, production and shipping delays.  You have our full commitment that we will work tirelessly to get you all the merchandise sent to you within the estimated time-table.  It’s important to us to come through on our agreement, especially when referring to giving half of our profits to The East LA Women's Center.  In researching other campaigns on this site, we anticipate that 30% of the funds will go directly to paying host fees, credit card transaction fees, cost of merchandise, and shipping cost.  The rest of the funds generated from this campaign will be split down the middle with the East LA Women's Center.  We believe it’s important to be honest and transparent with all our backers about the financial breakdown – building trust and community is the only way we want to do business.      </p>

<h3>My Music</h3>
<ul>
<li>Having studied, and played most styles of music ranging from Metal to Disco; over the past few years I have begun to mold my own style centered around the ethics of ""Jazz"". Jazz is it's own dialect within music. It's like having a good conversation. One where you don't speak without intent, and you're predominantly listening to those around you, trying to intelligently contribute to the conversation. When this is practiced in other genres of music, you begin to see that genre evolve and the musical exploration take shape. </li>
<li>This first album is a representation of my musical evolution. Combining elements of blues, rock, funk, hip-hop, jazz, and r&amp;b.</li>
<li>I will take all these techniques I've studied from these respective genres, and give them a voice within my music. Using the etiquette of Jazz and improvisation; you begin to hear the influences, and sound develop into its own unique thing. My musical ""identity"" if you will.</li>

My Story

My musical journey really started when I became a winner of moe.'s ""6th Member of moe."" contest via Relix Magazine in December of 2013. (Shown below)

After playing with some my musical heroes, it gave me the confidence to pursue playing music as a full time career.
After I graduated the State University of New York at Oneonta in 2013, where I received a Bachelor's degree in Music Industry with a minor in Audio Recording and Production, I moved west to Colorado. 
There I would continue to develop my craft, and grind as a Guitarist/Singer-Songwriter. Playing with bands like Technicolor Tone Factory, and Yamn (Videos Below).


 



Currently I am a contributing creative force behind the group Eminence Ensemble. I have been touring, and writing with the band since October of 2016. 





Now at the age of 28 with thousands of road miles under my belt, I'm looking toward the future of my music career in hopes to keep pushing the limits of my musical capabilities, my songwriting, and my art. 
Music is cathartic for me. It's one of those arts that not only allows you to express yourself, but also allows you to connect with people the world over. It's use as a language allows you to communicate fluently to create with someone who you would never think you would understand, creating a bond that is unspoken but heard.

<p>I am inviting you on a creative journey to help keep art alive. Art will always need funded and you can play a part in this collaboration.</p>
<h3><strong>Fund a single</strong></h3>
<p>I am raising <strong>$3,700</strong>. You may think this number is outrageously high, but it is actually more normal than you think.</p>
<p>Let me explain.</p>
<p>Anybody can throw some tunes into garage band and think “wallah, I have a single.”</p>
<p>Well, that is actually more of a demo. </p>
<p>When creating a single song, there are about 10-15 people involved.  All of these people need to be paid for their services. Especially if you expect those services to be professionally executed.</p>
<p><strong><i>And who are these people?</i></strong></p>

<li>Art Director </li>
<li>Videographer</li>
<li>Engineers</li>
<li>And more</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these roles are specific crafts and skills that take years and even schooling to master. </p>
<p><i><strong>So, what comes with 3.7k?</strong></i></p>
<p>The song will be fully available on all streaming platforms, including for sale on iTunes. There will also be a music video that goes along with this song, as well as a live performance video. </p>
<p>This song is part of a larger project for my forthcoming album <i>“There Is More Love Somewhere.”</i> Any additional funds made in this campaign will go towards supporting the project as a whole</p>
<p>My newer sound can be described as collaborating with the sounds of dance and Anglican mass. I am writing songs that can be found in church and at your local joint. As Christians, we should not only make music for Christians, but music that connects our heart, mind, and soul to our neighbor. </p>
<p>Because of the innovation musical streaming, the artist is hurting making money by selling records, and “Music Labels” are singing less artists because of this reason, but ART still needs funded. Music still needs to be made. And now it is in the hands of you to make that happen. </p>

<p>Most of you are probably aware of the music of Scottish prog rockers Citizen Cain who formed in the early 80s and, despite a couple of long hiatus, continued producing music until they disbanded in 2012. Now for the first time their back catalogue is to be made available on digital and streaming platforms which will open up their music to a whole new audience. We hope you can be a part of that process by contributing to this small fundraiser. In return you will recieve a link to a digtal copy of your chosen album(s) plus a link to an exclusive video of rare ""bootleg"" footage of the band playing live in the early 90s. The live footage was recorded during the ""Serpents In Camoflage"" tour and includes the performance of the entire album plus a cover version of the Gabriel era Genesis favourite ""Firth of Fifth"".</p>
<p>You can choose as a perk a digital copy of any title from our entire back catalogue:</p>
<p>Ghost Dance<br/>Serpents In Camouflage<br/>Somewhere But Yesterday<br/>Raising The Stones<br/>Playing Dead<br/>Skies Darken</p>
<p>We appreciate that many of you will already own these albums on CD but nevertheless we hope that you are willing to help out with the process of moving these classic pieces of prog history into the digital realms. Any contribution will be greatly appreciated and of course you will recieve the added bonus of seeing some of the only footage available of the band performing live.</p>
<p>The actual funding goal of the campaign is £200 (Indiegogo sets a £500 minimum goal) however, even if the fundraiser doesn't meet its goal, the funds will still be put towards the digitalisation of the back catalogue and all perks will stil be fulfilled (i.e, digital album of your choice and live bootleg footage video).</p>
<p>Many thanks to everyone who chooses to support this campaign and to all who have supported Citizen Cain and the associated solo projects along the way. It wouldn' happen without you guys!! THANK YOU!!</p>

<p>My name is Riley Whittaker, and I’m a 15 year old singer-songwriter, and musician. I live in a small town called Sedona AZ with my parents, and my two dogs, Charlie Brown, and Sally Brown.  I have always had a huge passion for music! I play multiple instruments including guitar, piano, violin, ukulele, and electric guitar. I have been writing songs since I was 12, and I have now written over 70 and released 7 singles. I have been singing since as long as I can remember, and I started playing instruments when I was 5. The first time I performed I was 8 years old and I sang in a local singing competition called Sedona Superstar. I have come so far since then! I have played around California in LA, San Diego, and I was accepted to play at the 2020 NAMM show in Anaheim. I also played around Nashville at the Bluebird Cafe, Douglas Cafe, and Country Music Hall of Fame. Last summer I played around Canada in Victoria, Vancouver, and Tofino! I have made so many other accomplishments that I am super proud of, and I know I will keep making bigger ones as the years go on! </p> <p>I am raising money to travel to Nashville and participate in the 2020 Tin Pan South Songwriting Seminar! It is a seminar with some of the top people who wrote the songs you hear on the radio almost everyday! I think this would be a great experience for me. A great way to connect with other writers, and other people who have a huge passion in music as well. I know this seminar will advance my songwriting skills in many different ways. Nashville itself has always felt like a second home to me, and I know it's the place I want to go when I’m done with highschool.  While I am there I would also get the chance to co-write with some of my friends that I met in Nashville two years ago, and hopefully play at some of the historic places I played at last time I was there! </p> <p>I am also raising money to record my first album! I have been putting out singles since 2017, and everyday I sit in my room and write another song. Recording music is one of my favorite parts of the songwriting process. I love to see it go from a little tune you wrote sitting on your bed, to a huge production. Although it is very expensive to record songs, and especially expensive to record an album. I think it would boost my music career a ton if I raised enough money to record an album. </p> <p>Anything can help me reach these goals! Just a simple share on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or a quick text to some of your friends! I would appreciate it so much, and I already appreciate all of the support I receive with my music! I hope you take the time to donate or even share and help me reach these goals!</p>

<p>¡Hola! Mi nombre es Maga Urdaneta, soy una cantautora de Caracas, Venezuela y ¡quiero darte la bienvenida a la página de mi proyecto!</p>
<p>Con esta campaña estoy buscando recolectar fondos para grabar, mezclar y masterizar mi primer álbum solista <strong>“El Mundo va a cambiar” </strong>que reúne mis composiciones originales que combinan elementos musicales de géneros como el pop, la música tradicional venezolana/latinoamericana y el jazz.</p>
<p>He estado trabajando en este proyecto <strong>FUSIÓN </strong>desde hace 2 años. El año pasado empecé a trabajar con el increíble maestro, músico y guitarrista venezolano Roldan Peña como mi productor, y hasta la fecha hemos creado 6 hermosos arreglos, llenos de energía y onda nueva. Roldan me ha ayudado a armar un “<i>dream team</i>” de músicos para grabar este disco, proceso que ya está en marcha, pero que aún falta un largo camino por recorrer para convertirlo en álbum completo.</p>
<p>Este trabajo es importante para mí porque realmente creo que hará una contribución al repertorio contemporáneo de la música venezolana y le dará un vistazo a la música de cantautor que se está haciendo en Venezuela. Y aun más importante, porque me darás la oportunidad de mostrar mi música, retratos de nuestra historia y promover nuestra cultura en un país donde básicamente nos estamos dedicando a sobrevivir.</p>
<h3>Los escenarios</h3>
<p>Crear este álbum ha sido un enorme reto, especialmente porque estamos enfrentando un obstáculo poco común, como los recientes apagones que nos dejan inhabilitados en todo sentido.</p>
<p><strong>Hasta la fecha hemos grabado 45% del EP</strong>: Forastero (afro fusión), El mundo va a cambiar (Onda nueva), El tiempo (samba pop), ¿Qué será? (Pop-jazz), Perdóname (balada jazz) y Tu partida (tonada). Estas son las 6 canciones que están siendo grabadas hasta el momento.</p>
<p>Hemos tenido 5 sesiones de estudio en las que se han grabado los siguientes instrumentos:</p>
<p>Baterías (César Villarroel y Miguel D’ Vicenzo) Bajo  (Jorge Ramoncini y Giovanni Ramírez), Guitarras (Maga Urdaneta), Guitarras eléctricas (Roldan Peña).</p>
<p>Aun debo cubrir el costo de los otros músicos que están participando en el proyecto y las horas de estudio derivadas.</p>
<p><strong><i>¿Para qué utilizaré los fondos?</i></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Para cubrir el costo de grabación de las 6 canciones del EP + Producir y grabar 4 canciones adicionales para completar un álbum de 10 canciones. Esto incluye las horas de estudio, personal técnico y los músicos.</li>
<li>Proceso de mezcla y masterizado.</li>
<li>Distribución digital y realización del disco físico.</li>
</ul>
<p>¡Por eso es que estoy solicitando tu apoyo y en retribución tendrás estas recompensas diferentes!</p>

<p>Mi nombre es María Gabriela, pero todos mis amigos me llaman Maga.

<h3>Riesgos y Desafíos</h3>
<p>El riesgo y desafío más importante es que vivo en un país en crisis. Venezuela está atravesando uno de los períodos más oscuros de su historia, viviendo una crisis humanitaria sin precedentes.</p>
<p>El mayor reto para ejecutar el plan, en este momento, es superar los cortes eléctricos, los cuales no podemos controlar. A pesar de todo, continuamos trabajando todos los días e incluso aunque el proyecto sufra demoras por esta razón, será completado.</p>

¡Hola! Mi nombre es Maga Urdaneta, soy una cantautora de Caracas, Venezuela y ¡quiero darte la bienvenida a la página de mi proyecto!
Con esta campaña estoy buscando recolectar fondos para grabar, mezclar y masterizar mi primer álbum solista “El Mundo va a cambiar” que reúne mis composiciones originales que combinan elementos musicales de géneros como el pop, la música tradicional venezolana/latinoamericana y el jazz.
He estado trabajando en este proyecto FUSIÓN desde hace 2 años. El año pasado empecé a trabajar con el increíble maestro, músico y guitarrista venezolano Roldan Peña como mi productor, y hasta la fecha hemos creado 6 hermosos arreglos, llenos de energía y onda nueva. Roldan me ha ayudado a armar un “dream team” de músicos para grabar este disco, proceso que ya está en marcha, pero que aún falta un largo camino por recorrer para convertirlo en álbum completo.
Este trabajo es importante para mí porque realmente creo que hará una contribución al repertorio contemporáneo de la música venezolana y le dará un vistazo a la música de cantautor que se está haciendo en Venezuela. Y aun más importante, porque me darás la oportunidad de mostrar mi música, retratos de nuestra historia y promover nuestra cultura en un país donde básicamente nos estamos dedicando a sobrevivir.
Los escenarios
Crear este álbum ha sido un enorme reto, especialmente porque estamos enfrentando un obstáculo poco común, como los recientes apagones que nos dejan inhabilitados en todo sentido.
Hasta la fecha hemos grabado 45% del EP: Forastero (afro fusión), El mundo va a cambiar (Onda nueva), El tiempo (samba pop), ¿Qué será? (Pop-jazz), Perdóname (balada jazz) y Tu partida (tonada). Estas son las 6 canciones que están siendo grabadas hasta el momento.
Hemos tenido 5 sesiones de estudio en las que se han grabado los siguientes instrumentos:
Baterías (César Villarroel y Miguel D’ Vicenzo) Bajo  (Jorge Ramoncini y Giovanni Ramírez), Guitarras (Maga Urdaneta), Guitarras eléctricas (Roldan Peña).
Aun debo cubrir el costo de los otros músicos que están participando en el proyecto y las horas de estudio derivadas.
¿Para qué utilizaré los fondos?

Para cubrir el costo de grabación de las 6 canciones del EP + Producir y grabar 4 canciones adicionales para completar un álbum de 10 canciones. Esto incluye las horas de estudio, personal técnico y los músicos.
Proceso de mezcla y masterizado.
Distribución digital y realización del disco físico.

¡Por eso es que estoy solicitando tu apoyo y en retribución tendrás estas recompensas diferentes!

- Descarga digital del single (antes de su estreno)
- Descarga digital del álbum “El Mundo va a Cambiar” + una carta personal dirigida hacia ti acerca del proyecto.
-  ¡Contenido exclusivo! Con tu contribución te enviaré actualizaciones, imágenes y videos del proceso de grabación, entrevistas al equipo involucrado en la producción.
- Álbum físico + poster firmado por mí (aunque no soy famosa, me gustaría enviarte mi agradecimiento, con mi puño y letra)
- Libro digital con las letras y cifrados de las canciones.
- ¡¡Una canción escondida!! Sí, una grabación  de una canción escondida que no estará contemplada en el álbum.
NOTA IMPORTANTE: Incluso si no llego a la meta final, los fondos estarán destinados a la grabación del disco.

<h3>I'll keep it short.</h3>
<p>Hey! </p>
<p>I'm Dakota Leigh. I’m a singer-songwriter, born and raised in Jersey City, NJ. I moved to Nashville a couple years ago and fall more in love with music every day. I've been playing, writing, and co-writing a ton recently and I'm finally ready to lay down some music and share what I've been working on.</p>
<p>I'm planning on releasing two singles at first, and then a 5 song EP. These songs are honest and real, and while it is scary to be vulnerable, it is also freeing. I am so excited to share my story and my songs with you, and I only hope that they make you feel something.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>Being an independent artist is no easy feat... they don't call us ""starving"" for nothin'. (I do love a good PB &amp; J sandwich though!)</p>
<p>Your contribution and support will pay for the studio time as well as the artwork and promotion that goes into releasing new music.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>My name is Caitelen. I'm a singer-songwriter, multi-instrument musician, composer, worship leader, poet, mama, and pastor's wife.  </i></p>
<p>Here's a little bit of <strong>my story</strong>:</p>
<p>I've been singing/performing since I was a 2, and writing, recording, and performing my original music since the age of 12. I've <a href=""https://caitelen.bandcamp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">released albums, singles, and other collaborative works </a>since 2010 and have been a worship leader for almost 20 years. </p>
<p>In 2015 I was diagnosed with a chronic illness called ME/CFS. The extreme pain, fatigue, and other physical limitations I experienced then, and continue to battle today, have taken me to some dark places physically, emotionally, and spiritually. These limitations weighed heavily on me as I wrestled deeply with doubt, pain, fear, and grief. But in that process, my eyes and heart were also opening to the ways I could see God at work for good.</p>
<p><a href=""https://caitelen.wixsite.com/undonebygrace/single-post/2016/11/23/My-Invisible-Illness-and-Gods-Purpose-in-Pain"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">There's more to the story</a>, but all of this has been fuel for the songwriting fire! These songs are personal, but I know they're part of a shared story I have with others who also battle chronic illness, doubt, fear, and questions of God's purpose in seasons of fallow. They are, like many of the Psalms, both honest about struggle, and filled with hope in the midst of pain. <i>I pray that they will be a balm and blessing to many, and to point them to the One in whom we have a living hope.</i></p>
<p><strong><i>It is my prayer, and my plan, to record, produce and send these songs out into the world.</i></strong></p>
<p>That said, it costs costs a lot of money to produce a record! This platform (Indiegogo) is for financial contributions toward that end, but if you would like to support me in another way (some friends have opened their homes for fundraising concerts, some have made helpful connections for me in the music world,  and many of you simply support me in prayer and words of encouragement), I welcome and appreciate and all support!  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>So... will you sow into this project with me? </i></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>Will you join me in bringing the stories and songs of ""Telltale Heart"" into the world?</i></strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><i>The Lowdown on $$ and perks you'll get when you contribute:</i></p>
<ul>
<li>I've got 14 songs ready to go. Some will be on an album, and a few will be released as singles or 2-3 song EP's (mini-albums). <strong>We need $25,000 to finish </strong>recording (studio time, paying other musicians, engineering costs), producing<strong> </strong>(mixing and mastering the songs), and distributing<strong> </strong>(digital distribution, Cd's and vinyl).  </li>
<li>
<u>What do you get out of it?</u> Besides the music itself and the chance to be part of making it, I'm offering special pre-release access to the music before anyone else hears it! Other perks of becoming a backer include getting some fun merchandise from my Undone by Grace and Dark Is Light albums, opportunities for us to meet and workshop some of YOUR work, opportunities to obtain the title of ""producer"" on one or more songs, and more! Check out all the perks to the right (click the box to the see more details on them).  </li>
<li>I've opted for <strong><a href=""https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=indiegogo+flexible+funding+vs+&amp;view=detail&amp;mid=25EF857A1B60F7BB928725EF857A1B60F7BB9287&amp;FORM=VIRE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Flexible Funding""</a> </strong>so that whatever funds come in will go toward completing the album and if we don't make the goal, we will still get to keep what came in.</li>
<li>If you've followed my previous music endeavors, you'll know that I work with some amazing and talented musicians and producers who have helped me produce high quality music. Excellence in production remains a high priority for this album, so what you hear when all is said and done will not disappoint! And this is another reason why raising the proper funds to pay my engineers and musicians is crucial!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><i>How and why is this project of value to you and to the world?</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Most of the songs on this album are more reflective, <strong>poetic</strong>, and introspective. Although my faith informs my writing, these are songs that can be enjoyed by a wide audience. My goal is not to force my beliefs on anyone, but to invite listeners into a story of mercy, forgiveness, and hope in the trials that life throws at us all. </li>

</div></div>","Short Summary
My name is Caitelen. I'm a singer-songwriter, multi-instrument musician, composer, worship leader, poet, mama, and pastor's wife.  
Here's a little bit of my story:
I've been singing/performing since I was a 2, and writing, recording, and performing my original music since the age of 12. I've released albums, singles, and other collaborative works since 2010 and have been a worship leader for almost 20 years. 
In 2015 I was diagnosed with a chronic illness called ME/CFS. The extreme pain, fatigue, and other physical limitations I experienced then, and continue to battle today, have taken me to some dark places physically, emotionally, and spiritually. These limitations weighed heavily on me as I wrestled deeply with doubt, pain, fear, and grief. But in that process, my eyes and heart were also opening to the ways I could see God at work for good.
There's more to the story, but all of this has been fuel for the songwriting fire! These songs are personal, but I know they're part of a shared story I have with others who also battle chronic illness, doubt, fear, and questions of God's purpose in seasons of fallow. They are, like many of the Psalms, both honest about struggle, and filled with hope in the midst of pain. I pray that they will be a balm and blessing to many, and to point them to the One in whom we have a living hope.
It is my prayer, and my plan, to record, produce and send these songs out into the world.
That said, it costs costs a lot of money to produce a record! This platform (Indiegogo) is for financial contributions toward that end, but if you would like to support me in another way (some friends have opened their homes for fundraising concerts, some have made helpful connections for me in the music world,  and many of you simply support me in prayer and words of encouragement), I welcome and appreciate and all support!  
So... will you sow into this project with me? 
Will you join me in bringing the stories and songs of ""Telltale Heart"" into the world?

What We Need & What You Get
The Lowdown on $$ and perks you'll get when you contribute:

I've got 14 songs ready to go. Some will be on an album, and a few will be released as singles or 2-3 song EP's (mini-albums). We need $25,000 to finish recording (studio time, paying other musicians, engineering costs), producing (mixing and mastering the songs), and distributing (digital distribution, Cd's and vinyl).  

What do you get out of it? Besides the music itself and the chance to be part of making it, I'm offering special pre-release access to the music before anyone else hears it! Other perks of becoming a backer include getting some fun merchandise from my Undone by Grace and Dark Is Light albums, opportunities for us to meet and workshop some of YOUR work, opportunities to obtain the title of ""producer"" on one or more songs, and more! Check out all the perks to the right (click the box to the see more details on them).  
I've opted for ""Flexible Funding"" so that whatever funds come in will go toward completing the album and if we don't make the goal, we will still get to keep what came in.
If you've followed my previous music endeavors, you'll know that I work with some amazing and talented musicians and producers who have helped me produce high quality music. Excellence in production remains a high priority for this album, so what you hear when all is said and done will not disappoint! And this is another reason why raising the proper funds to pay my engineers and musicians is crucial!


The Impact
How and why is this project of value to you and to the world?

Most of the songs on this album are more reflective, poetic, and introspective. Although my faith informs my writing, these are songs that can be enjoyed by a wide audience. My goal is not to force my beliefs on anyone, but to invite listeners into a story of mercy, forgiveness, and hope in the trials that life throws at us all. 
Some are expressly for the edification of the church in the context of worship. That is, they're worship songs intended to be taught and sung together in a corporate setting. I've already been sharing them in that context, but finishing production on them means more people and churches can hear and sing them as well! 
I've had the privilege of taking my music on the road quite a bit, leading worship and playing solo concerts. I plan to continue that as I am able to. In the next year, my music ministry will be taking me to California, Italy, Greece, Turkey, and some other U.S. locations. In the Fall, I will travel to Cuba to share my story and songs with some friends who are doing amazing things in the art community and the church there.  I've begun translating some of my music into Spanish to be able to share some of my songs in their heart language. Your support  on this project is a huge part of my  ministry in taking these songs around the world!

Together we fuse elements of pop punk, alt-rock, emo and pop rock. Earlier this year we released two singles, ""Colorblind"" and ""Safe"". We will be releasing an EP of 5 brand new songs this fall. We have complete faith in these tunes and realize that the next step to achieving our goals is to record in a high quality studio. It has been our dream for years to make our collection of songs the best they can be. For the next 30 days (ending July 28), we will be raising money to fund this dream.

<h3>Why We Need Your Help</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Here is a quick rundown of all expenses that our campaign is covering: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Tracking</strong>: $1800 - Tracking is the major part of the cost when recording an album. We will need roughly 3 full days in the studio ($600 each). Additional hours will be roughly $85/hrs (based off rates of local studios). </li>
<li>
<strong>Mixing</strong>: $400 - Mixing is often done hourly and with the studio rates above we calculated it will be no less than $400. </li>
<li>
<strong>Mastering</strong>: $250 - Mastering is the process done after mixing and gives the recordings balance, dynamic and loudness. It is just as essential as mixing and rates are on average $50 per song. </li>
<li>
<strong>CD Printing</strong>: $300 - Printing our EP onto CD is a big part of this campaign. We put lots of work into the artwork of our music and it will be a focal point of our future promotional methods as well as an item to sell at ours shows.</li>
<li>
<strong>Campaign Fees:</strong> $250 - Indiegogo is an amazing platform and the service they provide is invaluable, but the rates will be slightly higher if we don't reach our goal. Other fees also included are part of the shipping/product costs for all the merch rewards we offer.</li>
<li>
<strong>Total:</strong> $3000 - If we reach our goal and exceed the amount of $3000, we will be putting those funds into recording more of our songs. We have actually have more songs we wish to record but we felt 5 songs was an attainable goal. On the other hand, if we don't reach $3000 all the funds will go to tracking a smaller number of songs. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Your Impact</h3>
<p>Everyone who listens to our music and comes to ours shows means the world to us. That's why we are giving back in return.

<h3>WHO AM I AND WHY DO I SING?</h3>
<p>I am a passionate, adventurous mathematician who teaches religion, music and drama in the beautiful Sunshine State of Queensland, Australia. I love to travel, eat avocado, walk through lychee fields and gaze at beautiful creations such as waterfalls or hedges. </p>
<p>I had an epiphany once about how amazing it is that music can so beautifully capture wonderful concepts and life lessons within a melody. I fell in love with writing songs for and about my God. I am passionate about music and I truly believe it is such a great way to encourage souls on their journey in this life.</p>
<p>In 2013, I was privileged enough to release my first EP at the age of 19. My second EP came along in 2016 AND now it's time for number THREE :) </p>
<p>Through this music, I desire for all to know God for who He truly is. Love. For listeners to know how desperately and unconditionally He loves you. I hope to always write songs for Christ and to embrace any chance to share them with others.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Money going towards PLUS check out deals on the side!</h3>
<p>The money will go to recording, producing, mixing, mastering, printing, distributing and everything to with the new CD! <br/><br/>Thanks for even considering donating - I'm super grateful and hope you are encouraged and inspired by the music God has put into my life!

</div></div>","WHO AM I AND WHY DO I SING?
I am a passionate, adventurous mathematician who teaches religion, music and drama in the beautiful Sunshine State of Queensland, Australia. I love to travel, eat avocado, walk through lychee fields and gaze at beautiful creations such as waterfalls or hedges. 
I had an epiphany once about how amazing it is that music can so beautifully capture wonderful concepts and life lessons within a melody. I fell in love with writing songs for and about my God. I am passionate about music and I truly believe it is such a great way to encourage souls on their journey in this life.
In 2013, I was privileged enough to release my first EP at the age of 19. My second EP came along in 2016 AND now it's time for number THREE :) 
Through this music, I desire for all to know God for who He truly is. Love. For listeners to know how desperately and unconditionally He loves you. I hope to always write songs for Christ and to embrace any chance to share them with others.

Money going towards PLUS check out deals on the side!
The money will go to recording, producing, mixing, mastering, printing, distributing and everything to with the new CD! Thanks for even considering donating - I'm super grateful and hope you are encouraged and inspired by the music God has put into my life! If you can't give also, I value your prayers and support just as much! 
Oiiii, here is an awesome verse to inspire your life!
1 Peter 1:8-9Though you have not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy, for you are receiving the end result of your faith, the salvation of your souls.

<h3>Hunter</h3>
<p>Music has always been at the center of my life, from when I was 4 years old I had invented my own super hero who had incredible strength, so long as they were listening to music. As soon as the music stopped they would perish, as if superman had just come into contact with kryptonite. I know that I am not unique in feeling like music is the very life force energy that runs through our veins and creates our entire reality. This unbelievably intense and intimate connection with music is what inspired me to pick up a guitar at 8 years old and begin my path as a musician. Since then I've spent time playing in Orchestras, Rock bands, Jazz bands, Funk bands and exposing myself to as many different styles and people as I possibly could. </p>
<p>Due to the climate of the world we live in right now, it has become clear to me that we are in need of love, communication and community. As someone who desires to be an active participant in the community, it feels like it is time to step forward and offer what I can. During some of my experiences performing and sharing I've seen people dance, laugh, cry and love together, and these have been the most satisfying and fulfilling moments of my life this far. It is more of the dancing, more of the crying, and especially more of the loving that I wish to bring into our world and this is my mission with music. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! I'm Jason Manns, a singer/songwriter from Bowing Green, VA. I lived in Los Angeles for 15 years, before moving back home to this awesome (but tiny) town. I've had some amazing opportunities in the music industry, and I'm excited to start the second (possibly third?) chapter here in Bowling Green. As a singer/songwriter I've had music on quite a few TV shows, and have toured all over the world playing music. In the past five years or so I've started producing music, and even started a small record label. With quite a bit of help from my friends I've also booked shows and tours for myself and my friends, as well as helped build a small yearly music festival in Germany. But enough about me! here's my project. It's a culmination of ALL of that stuff with a few twists thrown in. Since I moved back I've still be traveling to Los Angeles to record because I don't have a studio here in BG, and I've also skipped BG more times than I've played it when I'm touring the east coast, either solo or with The Station Breaks, AND I've come to realize that live streaming is going to forever be an integral part of live music since so many people have used it for the first time both as performers and audience members... SO... here we go... </p>
<p>The Heist, Located in a 100+ year old bank in the heart of Bowling Green, VA, will be all of those things, PLUS a community project to help revitalize what's already a small town showing signs of coming back to life. I grew up here, and I remember this little town teeming with life. For the last 10 or 15 years the town and the county have been through some hard times, but recently things seem to be turning around with two new art studios, a photography studio, 3 new restaurants, a salon, and more all opening in the last 2 or 3 years, and I'm excited to chip in some live music with your help!</p>
<p> The Heist will be a live music venue inspired by my favorite small venues around the country, Eddie's Attic (ATL), Rockwood Music Hall (NYC), The Hotel Cafe (LA), The Evening Muse (Charlotte). Bowling Green is a small town, so this intimate venue will be the perfect size for the surroundings, 75-100 person capacity, it will have live streaming capabilities so that anyone can watch the shows from anywhere on earth, and it will also have a recording studio.(so I can finish my latest album!!) There is room to grow as well, so the plan is start small and do it right, but who knows what the future could hold! </p>
<p>I really can't adequately describe to you what this would mean to me and to the town. To take that stage with my friends would mean the world. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm all in. I mean that literally and figuratively. lol. I jumped into this project last year, and had I known this year would be the year of zero live music venues... I would have probably waited a little while. But, here's where we stand. I bought the building with my investors, and we've done all of the demo, built bathrooms, and a stage, made the venue handicapped accessible, which required a whole new entrance &amp; ramp. That's where we are now. I'll be financing the rest of this through a combination of your support, business loans, and 4,567 virtual busking sessions via stageit. </p>
<p>Since we're building a venue, Studio, and a place equipped for live stream gigs, the price tag is... daunting. but I'm confident with $100,000 we will be able to open the doors and start playing music. If we put every dollar we make back into the venue for a while then we'll get there! That was the idea initially anyway, I just figured I'd be gainfully employed while we did it. </p>
<p>What do you get for your contribution you may ask? oooh we have some fun stuff available. </p>
<p>The standard:</p>
<p>t shirts</p>
<p>coffee mugs, pint glasses, bottle openers, etc. </p>
<p>The unique</p>
<p>invitations to special events like tastings, wine pairings, special musical events, both streaming and in person, recording sessions, </p>
<p>The VIP treatments</p>
<p>Weekend getaways in Bowling Green with historic tours, fun excursions, live music, and good food. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Should we not reach the big goal, what ever we do raise will be put toward the audio visual equipment and the recording studio first. The live music/bar/restaurant aspect of the Heist won't be a priority until things get back to normal, so I'd hope to have live streams and vocal sessions happening in the venue this fall, and then in person shows next year sometime. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I don't think I've ever been involved in something that allows so many of the things I love to intersect in such a way. Music, live and streaming, recording, a place where the community can come together and enjoy art. A place where we can hopefully give young artists a chance to play for people they would normally be able to, (you guys) a chance for you all to see some talented folks that (at least at the moment) won't be playing in Germany or England or wherever you're tuning in from. And last but not least, a chance to take what I've been doing for almost 20 years and use it to help the place that helped make me who I am. I love this little town, and I think you will to when you get to know it. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I love new challenges, but sometimes I take on more of them than I should. I need to finish a record that was already behind schedule before Covid shut everything down. This is not separate from that, but a solution to that problem... albeit, it may take a little while. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know as well as anyone how 2020 changed things. I know quite a few people who are out of work, or waiting for things to pick back up. If that's you and you can't financially support this project please do not worry! Something that could help just as much as your monetary contribution is simply sharing this project with your friends and family or anyone you think might be interested! </p>

<h2>Welcome to Press Start!</h2>
<p>Our organization brings together two worlds seemingly at odds, classical symphonic music and video games soundtracks. We've already secured our board of directors, begun mapping out future projects, and produced our first video project! While we're confident our plans and the team make this organization come to life, we still need help. YOUR help to be specific!</p>
<p>To get our feet off the ground, we're raising funds to help mitigate start-up expenses and fund our virtual projects we've been designing and eagerly waiting to share with you. With a little help from our friends, we'll be able to publish our website, launch our Call-for-Scores initiative, produce more music videos, and so much more. Unfortunately, we're unable have live events until next year, so until it is safe to come together, we ask for your help to create fun and uplifting content for our community!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>How YOU can help us!</h2>
<p>Our goal for our first campaign is $5,000. Your financial support will help us deliver a number of projects we've designed for your enjoyment, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Producing 4-5 music videos showcasing video game music and chamber ensembles</li>
<li>Supporting our artists, audio engineers, and animator (yes, I said animator!)</li>
<li>Prize money for our Call-for-Scores Composition Competition</li>
<li>Finishing our website and marketing materials</li>
<li>Producing our first live event in Spring 2021</li>
<li>And so much more!</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">We have a board of directors who are already working to organize and schedule the details for each of these projects, so everything is in the works. However, in order to continue and finalize the next steps, we need funding and that's where you come in. Not only do you have the opportunity to build an orchestra with us, but you will be supporting artists during this tumultuous time!</span></p>

<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>The audience for classical music is fading, and as musicians we want to rebuild the classical music scene and the audience demographic. One of the communities that we want to reach out to is the gaming community! If we are able to show the gaming community how orchestras and musicians play a huge role in their video game world, then we can begin to build a relationship together and support one another. Our goal is to make fun and exciting music together based on the themes of the games we love. But we also see this initiative as a way to bring over an entire audience into the theaters and halls again! Music is what builds community and sustains us through incredibly hard times, just like the current environment that we find ourselves in today. It is the common thread that ties humanity together, and we know that our organization will continue bridging the gap between communities one video at a time!</p>

</div></div>","Welcome to Press Start!
Our organization brings together two worlds seemingly at odds, classical symphonic music and video games soundtracks. We've already secured our board of directors, begun mapping out future projects, and produced our first video project! While we're confident our plans and the team make this organization come to life, we still need help. YOUR help to be specific!
To get our feet off the ground, we're raising funds to help mitigate start-up expenses and fund our virtual projects we've been designing and eagerly waiting to share with you. With a little help from our friends, we'll be able to publish our website, launch our Call-for-Scores initiative, produce more music videos, and so much more. Unfortunately, we're unable have live events until next year, so until it is safe to come together, we ask for your help to create fun and uplifting content for our community!
 

How YOU can help us!
Our goal for our first campaign is $5,000. Your financial support will help us deliver a number of projects we've designed for your enjoyment, including:

Producing 4-5 music videos showcasing video game music and chamber ensembles
Supporting our artists, audio engineers, and animator (yes, I said animator!)
Prize money for our Call-for-Scores Composition Competition
Finishing our website and marketing materials
Producing our first live event in Spring 2021
And so much more!

We have a board of directors who are already working to organize and schedule the details for each of these projects, so everything is in the works. However, in order to continue and finalize the next steps, we need funding and that's where you come in. Not only do you have the opportunity to build an orchestra with us, but you will be supporting artists during this tumultuous time!

<p><strong>HELP FUND THE NEXT DRUSKY EP</strong></p>
<p>Family, friends, drunk huskies,  and fellow music lovers! Drusky is trying to get back in the studio to record some more music. It will be a small collection of songs we've been playing live for a while now and we would love to get them recorded and produced to their full potential. We are a three-piece indie/emo band based out of Provo, Utah. We've been together for about a year and a half now and it's been incredible being able to perform for so many great audiences. The future for drusky is looking bright and we're lucky enough to have the opportunity to record at a world-class studio with a very talented producer. </p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>WHERE IS THE MONEY GOING?</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, getting into the studio without the backing of a label can be expensive. We've decided to put together this campaign where people can contribute and recieve perks to help fund this ep! The cost for this project will be $12,000. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>studio time at June Audio</li>
<li>production costs</li>

</ul>
<p>We will start the recording process in November 2020 (NEXT MONTH) at June Audio in Provo, UT. The finished product will be a five song EP of the latest and greatest Drusky songs! We've been working on these for a long time and are very excited to show them to the world :)</p>

<h3>Greetings dear friends, old and new, past and future, music lovers and keen supporters... (yes, YOU!)</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We are here to enlist your support for a <strong>unique album project</strong>. A collaboration between two like-thinking musical minds: Colin Bass (Camel, Steve Hillage) on vocals, bass and piano, and Daniel Biro on keyboards. After years of slow-nurturing ideas, the two have finally, like a good wine,  got their project to reach maturity. </p>
<p>A collection of <strong>carefully crafted, intimate songs</strong> that came about very organically, purely through the will of the two protagonists to 'make something happen'. To create something very personal, fragile, beautiful, that faithfully reflected the wistful state of mind of two people looking at life from a 'seasoned' vantage point. <strong>Reclaiming innocence through experience.</strong></p>
<p>Why '<strong>Still</strong>'? Because it's all quite slow-moving. <strong>Ambient songs</strong>. Not much drums, just Daniel's <strong>vintage keyboards</strong> (Rhodes piano, Moog synths, Hammonds, string machines, acoustic piano), Colin's <strong>electric bass</strong> and, of course, <strong>voice</strong>. The <strong>stillness of contemplation but with strong emotional undercurrents</strong> that evoke childhood's innocence, love's complexities and society's conundrums. It's also the 'still' of '<strong><u>still</u> believing</strong>', '<strong><u>still</u> doing it</strong>' and '<strong><u>still</u> living with passion</strong>'. Despite everything... <strong>still...</strong></p>
<p>Anyway, enough of the melancholic philosophising psycho-babble.</p>
<p>Here's where we're at: the songs are almost done and recorded and they're sounding great! We are planning a <strong>beautiful limited edition CD package </strong>but, this being an artist-run independent production (read: 'poor'), <strong>we need your help</strong> with the following;</p>
<p>- <strong>Mixing and Mastering</strong> (when you pay someone to make your recording sound 'expensive')<br/>- <strong>Design and Manufacturing </strong>(when you pay someone to create a beautiful object you can actually touch and cherish)<br/>- <strong>Promotion</strong> (when you pay someone to say how great your music is)<br/>- <strong>A month holiday in the Maldives</strong> (when you're just kidding yourself...)</p>
<p>All this will cost around <strong>£10,000</strong> so that's what we're aiming for.</p>
<p>By <strong>pre-ordering the album</strong> or even going for one of the <strong>amazing perks and offers</strong>, you can infuse this project with your own personal DNA. Make the music more meaningful to you and to us.  </p>
<p>This campaign is <strong>scaleable depending on your input</strong>. The more support we get, the more lavish the production will be (you know you love those expensive looking special editions...).</p>
<p>Whatever happens, we're projecting a <strong>release in the</strong> <strong>Autumn of 2019</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Updates on progress will be uploaded here.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Friends! Creating an album is always an adventure. Making a dream come true. Bringing to life something that wasn't there before. So to get this baby on the road, or at least out of the delivery room, we need your participation. Everyone can adopt and become a member of the extended family. Be that favourite uncle or aunty now!</strong></p>

<h3>My ""Why?"" for These Two Albums</h3>
<p>   These two projects are very different. I guess since we're all prismatic and multidimensional, why shouldn't the music reflect such?</p>
<p>    I'm running this campaign because I need help to make these songs into records. I have been through so much shit in my life, especially over the past year and half facing big grief, sobriety, and inward looking at my patterns, shame, and addictions. I'm making this music in particular, because it represents parts of my life I want to own, celebrate, and share in hopes that others will feel similar ownership of their own stories and lives.</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555356893/k4clldulwomlojabozib.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u>I JUST WANNA LOVE YOU</u></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>I JUST WANNA LET YOU</strong></u></p>
<p>  My soul/rock record you'll be able to support-- <u>I JUST WANNA LOVE YOU / I JUST WANNA LET YOU</u> is a culmination of sounds and experiences that really represent a lot of my life's suffering around relationships, love addiction, and self-care. At these times, I had an inability to connect in healthy ways beyond obsession or addictive attachment. I believed I wasn't good enough of a human to NOT live in chaos.  This record represents that chaos diamond. All sides of it though! Sometimes chaos is fun! You dance to it, you groove, you meet crazy times, and other times its heartbreaking and you want it over! Haha, its all human, and its all good...</p>
<p> I actually felt wrong around these songs at times, because of what they were--an admission of my darkness and uniqueness. But today, I understand them to be a celebration (The album's last song ""Glories"" literally is a celebration of owning a bit of narcissism and power!) Without these times of ego, suffering, without reflection upon them, I would have never have found the peace I have now.</p>
<p>We don't find liberation from everything being hunky-doory or being perfect angels. It takes some suffering to get us interested in waking up to our trances of selfishness and pain. This record celebrates my darkness, my egoic tendencies, my addicted lifestyle. All of it! We are here to embrace suffering, to celebrate brokenness, disconnect and receive all the gifts that come with the shadow; because only in acceptance can we find freedom.</p>
<p>These are mostly upbeat songs from a unique addict person with sense of humor,  and they are fun! And they are a part of me and every human. Embrace, embrace, embrace.</p>
<p>   My goal with these 5 songs on <u>IJWLY/IJWLY</u> is congruent with my larger goal as an artist: to tell the truth so that others may find in themselves, the courage and permission to tell their own.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555357377/theszinb8fvyh94f5zpc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u>PILOT LIGHT</u></strong></p>
<p>  If <u>IJWLY/IJWLY</u> is a record of my suffering, then <u>Pilot Light</u> is a record of my compassion and kindness coming forth to meet it! After 15 years of addiction (some good, some bad, some ugly), these 5 songs have been written in moments of recent grace; these were written in moments of deep understanding of despair and real attempts at acceptance.  These songs are special, powerful, and smart folk songs that came slowly with a lot of trust and a lot of joyful tears. They make me different after I play them. I'm calling this E.P. <u>Pilot Light</u> because these songs encourage the softest and most tender parts of us to truly come forward, but to never burn out. These pieces are sweeter anthems for staying true to your own inner light. Straight up, I play these songs when I'm sad and I feel better.</p>
<p>These works are bridge songs, taking me from one place to another; they bridge the gap between how I think I ought to be, and who I really am. And when I play these songs for others, I always find kindred spirits in the audience thanking me for my honesty, and for telling their story. There are always a lot of emotions around these songs and I really believe they are medicine for hope. I think all music is, but I know from real time experience, these songs bring me forward movement in the dark.</p>
<h3>What I'm Asking For &amp; What You Get!</h3>
<p>The monetary goal for these two projects to come to fruition is 3,325$</p>
<p>If 150 people give $22.20 (the cost of a good book!) I'll hit this goal.</p>
<p>This support goal covers for a lot of costs for <u>BOTH</u> 5-song records combined:</p>
<ul>
<li>Production &amp; Post Production Costs</li>
<li>Musicians &amp; Engineers</li>
<li>Studio Time</li>
</ul>
<p>While this campaign does not totally cover costs to make these records, it helps A LOT and helps me move the process along to get these pieces made. In effect, with your help, its like we'll all make these pieces happen so we all get to reap the benefits of satisfaction and accomplishment from their fruition! My community has kept me alive and sober and brought me to wellness, I'm excited to have my community be a special part of these records, too.</p>

</div></div>","My ""Why?"" for These Two Albums
   These two projects are very different. I guess since we're all prismatic and multidimensional, why shouldn't the music reflect such?
    I'm running this campaign because I need help to make these songs into records. I have been through so much shit in my life, especially over the past year and half facing big grief, sobriety, and inward looking at my patterns, shame, and addictions. I'm making this music in particular, because it represents parts of my life I want to own, celebrate, and share in hopes that others will feel similar ownership of their own stories and lives.

I JUST WANNA LOVE YOU
I JUST WANNA LET YOU
  My soul/rock record you'll be able to support-- I JUST WANNA LOVE YOU / I JUST WANNA LET YOU is a culmination of sounds and experiences that really represent a lot of my life's suffering around relationships, love addiction, and self-care. At these times, I had an inability to connect in healthy ways beyond obsession or addictive attachment. I believed I wasn't good enough of a human to NOT live in chaos.  This record represents that chaos diamond. All sides of it though! Sometimes chaos is fun! You dance to it, you groove, you meet crazy times, and other times its heartbreaking and you want it over! Haha, its all human, and its all good...
 I actually felt wrong around these songs at times, because of what they were--an admission of my darkness and uniqueness. But today, I understand them to be a celebration (The album's last song ""Glories"" literally is a celebration of owning a bit of narcissism and power!) Without these times of ego, suffering, without reflection upon them, I would have never have found the peace I have now.
We don't find liberation from everything being hunky-doory or being perfect angels. It takes some suffering to get us interested in waking up to our trances of selfishness and pain. This record celebrates my darkness, my egoic tendencies, my addicted lifestyle. All of it! We are here to embrace suffering, to celebrate brokenness, disconnect and receive all the gifts that come with the shadow; because only in acceptance can we find freedom.
These are mostly upbeat songs from a unique addict person with sense of humor,  and they are fun! And they are a part of me and every human. Embrace, embrace, embrace.
   My goal with these 5 songs on IJWLY/IJWLY is congruent with my larger goal as an artist: to tell the truth so that others may find in themselves, the courage and permission to tell their own.
 

PILOT LIGHT
  If IJWLY/IJWLY is a record of my suffering, then Pilot Light is a record of my compassion and kindness coming forth to meet it! After 15 years of addiction (some good, some bad, some ugly), these 5 songs have been written in moments of recent grace; these were written in moments of deep understanding of despair and real attempts at acceptance.  These songs are special, powerful, and smart folk songs that came slowly with a lot of trust and a lot of joyful tears. They make me different after I play them. I'm calling this E.P. Pilot Light because these songs encourage the softest and most tender parts of us to truly come forward, but to never burn out. These pieces are sweeter anthems for staying true to your own inner light. Straight up, I play these songs when I'm sad and I feel better.
These works are bridge songs, taking me from one place to another; they bridge the gap between how I think I ought to be, and who I really am. And when I play these songs for others, I always find kindred spirits in the audience thanking me for my honesty, and for telling their story. There are always a lot of emotions around these songs and I really believe they are medicine for hope. I think all music is, but I know from real time experience, these songs bring me forward movement in the dark.
What I'm Asking For & What You Get!
The monetary goal for these two projects to come to fruition is 3,325$
If 150 people give $22.20 (the cost of a good book!) I'll hit this goal.
This support goal covers for a lot of costs for BOTH 5-song records combined:

Production & Post Production Costs
Musicians & Engineers
Studio Time

While this campaign does not totally cover costs to make these records, it helps A LOT and helps me move the process along to get these pieces made. In effect, with your help, its like we'll all make these pieces happen so we all get to reap the benefits of satisfaction and accomplishment from their fruition! My community has kept me alive and sober and brought me to wellness, I'm excited to have my community be a special part of these records, too.

The Musicians, The Producers & The StudioI JUST WANNA LOVE YOU / I JUST WANNA LET YOU""The Cottage"" a Studio in East Nashville
I'm currently working with Evan Sieling, a remarkable producer and now friend, on a couple of tracks on the IJWLY E.P.
Evan has produced ""Cold Stop"" my most recent single, and has remixed ""Believer"" which is now the version on all digital platforms for my band's first single. He also has produced for labels and some well known Christian artists.
We work together beautifully and he loves the music we make!
We continuously work with session players such as: Rachel Crick (fiddle), Nick Haynes (horns) Peter Wilson (drums), Gideon Boley (guitar) and a lot of other gems in Nashville!
PILOT LIGHT""Sundog Studios"" another Studio in East Nashville
Another producer I've worked with in town is Michael Esser, he's worked with Black Crows and has engineered for artists such as Jack White and many more.
We'll be doing this 5-song record raw and folky and mostly untouched!
All five songs will be live and will capture the song's natural kindling and sweet fire and 6 piece band
Michael will play drums, myself on acoustic guitar, Rachel Crick on fiddle and a whole lot more!
BOTH of these guys are BEAUTIFUL and different, and reach me and my music in different ways.I'm glad to share details about what's going into these projects, and who is going to be touching them!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>Gran Reserva is our second album. The first album (El circo de la vida) was 100% ""home made"" and we wanted to go a step farder this time.</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We already found the person who´s gonna mix and master the album. He knew we didn´t have much money but he liked our sound and wanted to work on it. Our first idea was a crouwdfunding where people don´t need to spend much. We just need 50 people buying our ""Gran Reserva"" in advance (just 10 euros). So that´s our goal... You buy our album before we master it and once it´s ready we´ll send you the digital album direct to your mail.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Even if we don´t get to the minimum of 500 euros, we will pay the difference so every person who´s buying it in advance can be sure that he will get the final mastered album.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>We belive that we have a good product. Mastering an album nowadays is very important as radios, promoters..... won´t give a chance to home made albums no matter how good the songs are.</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>As an independent band we will be very happy if you can follow us the way you prefer.

<p>Hello, I’m David, and this is my solo project named Dave Van Detta.</p>
<p>Starting my career with sights set on becoming a solo artist and the first metal solo double bassist in the world my early beginnings span from countless first prizes in classical competitions, multiple national rock festival, and competitions, appearing on national television, up to touring with classical symphonic orchestras across southern Europe.</p>
<p>A revelation retold is so much more than just another album, its a story 3 years in the making and a culmination of more than 15 years of music education, writing and performing. My goal for this album is to shatter the monotony that is currently reigning in the mainstream metal industry, with some innovative take on combining classical instruments into new metal genres whilst staying true to metal’s roots.</p>
<p>For me this is not something I do as a hobby, or to see if it will succeed - for me it’s everything and I don’t plan on stopping.</p>
<p>So, if you want to help spread the message of my music, if you want to donate in exchange for band merch, which I really want you to have, now you can through this campaign.</p>
<p>You’ll be making a dream come true.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Who is Multicultural Sonic Evolution (MuSE)?</h3>
<p>We are MuSE, a non-profit organization co-directed by composer <a href=""http://www.yuikitamura.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Yui Kitamura</a> and percussionist <a href=""https://www.chihiroshibayama.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Chihiro Shibayama</a>. (Click our names to learn more about ourselves individually) Each season we produce unique showcases that provide talented artists who embrace musical elements in their work with a platform for sharing their craft. Our collaborators include dancers, filmmakers, animators, writers, fashion and hair stylists, and so on.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What’s “Sounds of Arts Festival (SOAF)”?</h3>
<p>We had our first “Sounds of Arts Festival” in November 2011 at the Secret Theatre in Long Island City, NY.  We had wanted to create a multidisciplinary show that combined elements of different disciplines such as dance, theatre, fashion, film and music.  If all of these art forms were infused with music, what would that sound like?  It was through this creative process that the ""Sounds of Arts Festival"" was born.  Over the last 9 years, we have produced more than 100 programs and featured over 400 artists!</p>
<p>We were planning to make the 10th year anniversary of the festival big and special this year, however, everything changed when New York City venues had to shut down due to COVID-19. We lost our be-loved venue, the Secret Theatre, which had to close its door permanently in May 2020. That's when we learned that we were unable to produce the 10th Year anniversary celebration in the theatre where we started the festival. </p>
<p><strong>Other impacts due to the pandemic</strong></p>
<p>Not only the festival, but we also had to cancel every concert we had planned such as our annual choral &amp; orchestral concert which we have been presenting every spring since 2016. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why we need your help</h3>
<p>The pandemic didn’t stop us from producing concerts! We started a “<a href=""https://www.musefriends.org/quarantini-concert-series"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Quarantini Concert Series</a>” which is a free online event where Yui and Chihiro talk about different works and show performance videos of artists who have worked with MuSE. </p>
<p>We also decided to host the 10th Anniversary Sounds of Arts Festival 2020 virtually. We asked our past collaborators to submit videos (mostly brand-new!) to be included in this festival. You can see this amazing 12-hour-long video featuring more than 100 artists on YouTube Premieres starting on December 17th, 2020.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Today, we are asking for your support to fund our 2020 - 2021 season. The fund will directly help the artists fee and help MuSE produce future concerts either virtually, or in-person when it's safe to do so. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""><strong>Are you wondering why we chose $4041 as a goal?</strong> It comes from the year 2020 + 2021 = 4041 :-)</span></p>

That's when we learned that we were unable to produce the 10th Year anniversary celebration in the theatre where we started the festival. 
Other impacts due to the pandemic
Not only the festival, but we also had to cancel every concert we had planned such as our annual choral & orchestral concert which we have been presenting every spring since 2016. 
 
Why we need your help
The pandemic didn’t stop us from producing concerts! We started a “Quarantini Concert Series” which is a free online event where Yui and Chihiro talk about different works and show performance videos of artists who have worked with MuSE. 
We also decided to host the 10th Anniversary Sounds of Arts Festival 2020 virtually. We asked our past collaborators to submit videos (mostly brand-new!) to be included in this festival. You can see this amazing 12-hour-long video featuring more than 100 artists on YouTube Premieres starting on December 17th, 2020.
Today, we are asking for your support to fund our 2020 - 2021 season. The fund will directly help the artists fee and help MuSE produce future concerts either virtually, or in-person when it's safe to do so. 
Are you wondering why we chose $4041 as a goal? It comes from the year 2020 + 2021 = 4041 :-)
All donation is tax-deductible. 
 
What you will get:
*These perks are all digital to be pandemic-safe and will be delivered in February-April 2021
 

$10 // MuSE Digital thank you postcard - delivered February 2021
$20 // MuSE Sounds of Arts Festival 2020 Digital Poster (plus all of the perks above) - delivered February 2021

<p>The quest to make Good Thing continues! </p>
<p>In the first round we raised $7, 265. After Indiegogo took their cut I ultimately netted $6,590.56 of my goal of $15,575. Turns out crowdfunding during a worldwide pandemic is hard! </p>
<p>The need to make a living drove me onto the road to work in the aftermath of the Derecho in Iowa and Hurricane Sally. When I'm working during storms it takes every bit of my time and energy to focus...........6:30am up..........at it all day............go to sleep at 1am..........get up and do it all again 7 days a week.........turns out this time.........for 2 months. </p>
<p>Directly after my work was done I headed to Nashville to begin work on the new record. The morning we were to begin recording I get word that one my band member’s partners had tested positive for COVID. I sat in my camper in the Walmart Parking lot in Cool Springs for two days trying to figure out a solution to start moving forward with the recording process. To complicate matters, Bob Britt's wife Etta is dealing with cancer............and I just imagined him coming into the studio.........masked up, doing all the right things........and then going home to her at night. All signs were pointing to me not making the record at this particular time. </p>
<p>So, we have to adjust. This record will be made. As things seem to be opening up everywhere.......I’m feeling optimistic that we will be able to start recording this summer in the warmer months, or sooner if it makes sense. </p>
<p>The two month campaign was tough, but enlightening. One thing that really came into shape was the weekly live webcasts that I started doing to highlight Good Thing.  I had some incredible special guests.............Robert Reynolds from The Mavericks, Garry Tallent from Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, Sean Snook, Johnny Mackinnon from The Roadtrippers, Jude Johnstone, Sonny West “0h Boy” and “Rave On”, Carlene Carter, Nashville session legend Ron Oates, Jerry Fuller “Travelin’ Man” and “Young Girl”..........pretty amazing friends and musical cohorts.  The interaction with my friends on Facebook during the webcasts was a real lift each Sunday and running the new songs past everyone in realtime was invaluable. </p>
<p>So, I'll continue that. </p>
<p><strong>The Perks.</strong></p>
<p>I streamlined the perks a bit this time. Cds, Vinyl, t-shirt, and a selection of Backyard Concerts are available. A personal Facetime/Zoom concert is also an option now. Make sure to scroll all the way to the bottom for the Backyard Concerts and Executive Producer option. Grab one now and let's push it over the edge!</p>
<p><strong>Vinyl of all the rage..................</strong></p>
<p>My debut, Fear Nothing, came out on A&amp;M Records on Cd..........completely missing vinyl. This will be my first record to be printed on vinyl. I'm so fired up about that. This is the record player I got for Christmas. Cannot wait to spin Good Thing on it! Grab your vinyl copy!</p>

<h3>Hi there, My name is Nandun and I am a Singer/ Songwriter &amp; Live Looping Artist based in Brisbane, Australia.</h3>
<p>I am an Independent Pop &amp; RnB artist. I have been writing music for what seems like all my life and finally released my first 2 songs in 2020, after being a full time performing artist for the past 4 years.</p>
<p>Now, I am set to release my 3rd single, titled ""Don't Run"" but there is just one small issue, which is money. The past year has been hard on all of us, but creatives especially suffered a big hit financially. I myself personally lost half my income. Which is why I am asking for your HELP to fund a portion of the recording, mixing, mastering and promotion costs that will go towards this next track. The theme of this track will center around not running away when things get tough, cause you are not alone. </p>
<p>Music is the best way I know how to express myself, and at this point its kind of like the only thing I'm good at! I started writing music for myself, but at some point people started to listen and I just went with it.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>When you are an independent artist ready to make the next leap, there are certain things that cannot be done on your own. Making a track does not come cheap, and as with everything ""what you pay is what you get"". That is why I have set a goal of $2000 AUD. This money will cover a portion of studio recording, mixing, mastering and promotion costs. </p>
<p>My plan is to have this track ready to be released for your ears in February 2022.</p>
<p>In addition, I've included a bunch of perks to thank you for your contribution to this campaign. These range from a digital copy of the single, free music lessons, all the way up to booking me to play at your next event.  And of course, you can donate more than the perk cost if you feel so inclined. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I truly appreciate any help you can provide. Every little bit goes a long way,  and would mean the world to me. But even if you aren't in the capacity to contribute yourself, even sharing this campaign with your friends would help heaps!</p>
<p>Last but not least, thank you for all your support and I look forward to taking this next step in my journey with you.</p>

We are fortunate enough to have an excellent music program, through which we have gained the chance to form an appreciation for music in its various forms, as well as been allowed the chance to express ourselves artistically and discover new areas of aptitude.

 nombre es Juan Ignacio Lizarralde, soy golfista profesional Uruguayo 
desde 2007. Empecé jugando a este apasionante deporte a los 5 años con 
mi padre y mi hermano. Desde ese momento se convirtió en mi pasión.
2013 - Ganador Soul Session Championship y CBG PRO Tour Edition - Brasil
2013 - Puesto #40 PGA Tour Latino.
2012/2014 - Miembro del PGA Tour Latino.
2007 - Participación Miccosukee Open Miami, Nationwide Tour - Estados Unidos
2001/2005 - Ganador de 10 torneos universitarios y regionales por Oklahoma Christian University - Estados Unidos
2004-2005  - Segundo puesto en los nacionales universitarios. - Estados Unidos
2004 - Campeón del Abierto Internacional de Lima - Perú 2003 - Campeón del Abierto Internacional de Lima - Perú







En Uruguay es muy difícil costear los gastos sin un apoyo económico externo. Para llegar al PGA Tour es necesario cubrir viajes, inscripciones, estadías, caddies y demás gastos que exigen las competiciones de primer nivel. Jugar a este nivel me permitirá sumar puntos para representar a Uruguay en los Juegos Olímpicos.
En los últimos dos años he invertido USD 60.000 aproximadamente de mi propio dinero para cubrir todos estos gastos. Lamentablemente, al no conseguir el apoyo local para seguir compitiendo tuve que desviar la atención de mi entrenamiento para brindar clases de Golf y seguir vinculado al deporte. 
Para continuar compitiendo es necesario contar con USD 40.000 para cubrir el año.



Desde muy joven comencé a perfeccionar mi técnica de la mano de distintos profesores. A los 13 años empecé a competir internacionalmente por Uruguay en América y Europa.  Durante mi carrera como amateur en Uruguay tuve la suerte de ganar la mayoría de los torneos importantes en los que competí (Campeón Nacional, 2 veces Campeón del Abierto de la Ciudad de Montevideo, 3 veces ganador del Campeonato del Club, 2 veces ganador de la Copa de Oro). 

En el 2001 conseguí junto a el equipo uruguayo el primer y único título en la historia del golf uruguayo, el Sudamericano ""Copa Los Andes"".


En el último año trabajé con  Mariano Bartolomé, uno de los mejores profesores a nivel mundial, para elevar mi juego al máximo nivel. Desde comienzos del 2015, junto a Gonzalo Cortazzo, realizó un acondicionamiento físico completo para estar a la altura de las competencias de alto rendimiento.
El objetivo desde que empecé a jugar competitivamente fue llegar al PGA Tour y competir en los juegos olímpicos representando a Uruguay.
¡Vos podes ayudarme a conseguir este sueño!

<span><h3>¿Quién Soy?</h3> Hola chicos y chicas! Mi nombre es Catalina González. Soy cantautora chilena de 21 años de edad, actualmente residiendo en la área de New Haven, Connecticut, en EEUU. He estado creando música desde que tenía 12 años y he lanzado dos EPs oficiales desde el 2012 (<a href=""http://catalinagonzalez.bandcamp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">PUEDE ESCUCHARLOS AQUÍ</a>). Creo que ahora es el momento en el que tengo que crear un album completo. Tengo las canciones y las ideas, pero por desgracia, me falta el dinero. Estoy haciendo mí mejor esfuerzo para ahorrar dinero en mi rutina diaria. Sin embargo, pensé que podía encontrar una ayuda extra con mis amigos/as!</span> <br/><br/><span>Grabé mi EP más reciente, ""Roadrunner"", un estudio llamado SubCat Studios en Syracuse, NY. Para este álbum de larga duración voy a volver a este maravilloso estudio de grabación a fines de Mayo con el fin de grabar este album debút con la ayuda del ingeniero en sonido, Jeremy Johnston y mis amigos Evan Pitonzo y Justin Costello. Grabar en un estudio de este calibre cuesta dinero, sobre todo porque me gustaría añadir nueva instrumentación, lo que equivale a más $$$. He dejado que mucha agua corra por el río y ya es tiempo de hacer esta inversión la cual me parece que es necesaria ya que me va a catapultar a la siguiente etapa de mi carrera. Ya he aventurado y tocado en diferentes ciudades y he difundido mi presencia y sonido. Ahora todo lo que necesito es una obra completa y con más cuerpo profesional para presentarle al mundo! AHORA ES LA HORA!<br/><span><br/>Les pido toda la ayuda que me puedan dar! Un dólar aquí, un dólar allá, y todo lo que se encuentra entre medio está más que apreciado. Sí ustedes no pueden donar dinero a mi campaña, entonces todo lo que pido es que difundan mi campaña con sus familias y amigos/as en sus plataformas sociales! Estaré super agradecida por cualquier tipo de ayuda que me puedan dar!<br/><br/>Muchas gracias!!! :)<br/></span><br/></span>

¿Quién Soy? Hola chicos y chicas! Mi nombre es Catalina González. Soy cantautora chilena de 21 años de edad, actualmente residiendo en la área de New Haven, Connecticut, en EEUU. He estado creando música desde que tenía 12 años y he lanzado dos EPs oficiales desde el 2012 (PUEDE ESCUCHARLOS AQUÍ). Creo que ahora es el momento en el que tengo que crear un album completo. Tengo las canciones y las ideas, pero por desgracia, me falta el dinero. Estoy haciendo mí mejor esfuerzo para ahorrar dinero en mi rutina diaria. Sin embargo, pensé que podía encontrar una ayuda extra con mis amigos/as! Grabé mi EP más reciente, ""Roadrunner"", un estudio llamado SubCat Studios en Syracuse, NY. Para este álbum de larga duración voy a volver a este maravilloso estudio de grabación a fines de Mayo con el fin de grabar este album debút con la ayuda del ingeniero en sonido, Jeremy Johnston y mis amigos Evan Pitonzo y Justin Costello. Grabar en un estudio de este calibre cuesta dinero, sobre todo porque me gustaría añadir nueva instrumentación, lo que equivale a más $$$. He dejado que mucha agua corra por el río y ya es tiempo de hacer esta inversión la cual me parece que es necesaria ya que me va a catapultar a la siguiente etapa de mi carrera. Ya he aventurado y tocado en diferentes ciudades y he difundido mi presencia y sonido. Ahora todo lo que necesito es una obra completa y con más cuerpo profesional para presentarle al mundo! AHORA ES LA HORA!Les pido toda la ayuda que me puedan dar! Un dólar aquí, un dólar allá, y todo lo que se encuentra entre medio está más que apreciado. Sí ustedes no pueden donar dinero a mi campaña, entonces todo lo que pido es que difundan mi campaña con sus familias y amigos/as en sus plataformas sociales! Estaré super agradecida por cualquier tipo de ayuda que me puedan dar!Muchas gracias!!! :)",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div>
<div>I was born in Veracruz, Mexico but I've lived in the US for the last 19 years. My blood is Mexican and my heart American. My father named me Elthon due to his passion for music, Elton John's successful career, and his desire to have a son that would love music and eventually choose it as his career. The “H” in my name was added by my parents for individuality.  <p>I was raised in the states and immediately showed interest in music at a young age. I grew up listening to popular music, rock, ballads, and have always favored music driven by a talented vocalist. At the age of 15 I began to focus on building my skills as a guitarist.  </p>
<p>After graduating high school I went to a Gap Year school to really focus on myself, develop my leadership skills, personal character, and ultimately figure out what I really wanted to do. At this time I was actively recording and learning as much as I could about audio production. I then applied, was accepted, and granted a scholarship into Palm Beach Atlantic University of Florida for Music Composition and Performance. However, upon realizing my true passion and potential, I decided to stay in Raleigh, NC and begin a career in audio production and engineering. </p>
<p>I have been freelancing, working with various companies, and making professional connections since I made the decision to stay in Raleigh. My part in Raleigh Recording Co. is contributing the unique structural approach to audio production and engineering that I've developed through my personal experience.</p>

<p>What I enjoy most however, is working with other musicians. Since around the age of 18 I've been an active part of the Raleigh music scene. With Raleigh Recording Co.

My real interest in music began at the age of 10 when I started taking piano lessons. This helped spark my passion for music and I came to learn a lot about not only music theory, but the history of music as well. A few years later I began taking guitar lessons and this only served to strengthen my passion for music.
What I enjoy most however, is working with other musicians. Since around the age of 18 I've been an active part of the Raleigh music scene. With Raleigh Recording Co. I want to take that to the next level! I want to work with other musicians and help them not only further their musical careers  but also be a part of the wonderful music and culture that Raleigh has to offer. 

How we got to ""now.""
Over the last 5 years we've individually put in countless hours, dollars, and personal time building our relationships, experience, and business ideas. Over the last year alone we've invested over $30,000 in preparation for where we are now. We have a lot at stake and we couldn't be more excited to get Raleigh Recording Co. off the ground.




What we need. 

 We need $50,000 to cover our non-recoupable construction costs which include:


Building materials 
Construction & manual labor costs
Design Engineer
Structural Engineer 
Permits & Inspections
Contractor
etc.

Initial studio layouts and designs. 




Current space.
We're in an industrial space located less than 10 min from downtown Raleigh, NC. 








Even if our goal is not reached, all money raised will be used exclusively to fund construction costs. We already have a $25,000 investment for equipment and other various misc. startup costs. 
Now we're asking for your help in funding our studio construction.

What you get.
We will be providing very cool limited run items like shirts, stickers, discounts, and even free studio time/projects to contributors! 
See breakdown of contribution perks in the ""perks"" section to the right ---->

Check out our basic business ""pitch"" here: https://pitch.liveplan.com/qGSNb/YIRcX


Full business plan available for those interested in further investment or partnering with us.

P.S. - We acknowledge that we've set a pretty ambitious goal. We've already started construction and have some investment capital lined up. We wanted to open the door for community involvement and contribution right from the start. 

Even if we don't reach our full goal, we will use 100% of the money to fund as much of the construction costs as possible. 


The impact.

 By contributing to our start up you will be helping us begin one of our lifelong goals, having a positive impact within our community while doing something we love. Music. We've already started working with local non profits, artists, and businesses but need your help in reaching the next step: building our physical studio space. 


Risks & challenges.

 We are fully aware that we may not reach our full goal in which case we have alternate funding options lined up. We are hopeful in sharing our vision with you and appreciative of the help we've received so far. Either way, Raleigh Recording Co. will happen and we'd love for you to be a part of it. Rewards/Perks will still be fulfilled regardless of having reached the full goal or not. 


Other ways you can help.

 Even if you can't help financially, you can share with friends or anyone else you think might be interested in contributing to our start up. We are always open to ideas and new ways to collaborate with people. Much love, Donald, Elthon, & Trevor.

<p><br/></p>Approaching Troy
<div>Approaching Troy is a 5 piece band based out of Long Island, NY. This band started as an outlet and solo project for lead singer/songwriter Jake Salazar, but during its  inception back in 2010, Jake had no idea how huge this project was really going to be. Fast forward to 2015, with the addition of Bassist Dom Bono, guitarists Jay Sutherland and Sean Doherty, drummer Joe Neglia and many goals accomplished the band is finally on their way to success. There's one problem though, we need your help. For the past 6 months, the band has worked diligently on their new EP, ""Dear Sadie"" from tracking, to recording, and are in the final steps of releasing this giant EP for us. Unfortunately, recording an album is unbelievably expensive. This is where we turn to you guys; our family, friends and most importantly the people who have showed us love and support since our very first show almost 4 years ago and now our brand new awesome fans as well. </div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Here's the lowdown of the project. We need about $800 to finish this project including, recording costs, mastering, and duplication; but we don't just want to take your money; believe us thats the last thing we want to do. We have several perks just for believing in us and helping us achieve our dreams. These perks range from an Official Approaching Troy Bracelet, a signed copy of our new EP ""Dear Sadie"", when it comes out, a signed t-shirt, personalized Skype session with the band, to an in-house personal acoustic performance for you and your friends. (Check the side bar for more perks.) </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>We will be releasing our dream project, a 5 song EP that we believe will open new doors for us in the music industry and some awesome prizes will be given away for those who can contribute and help us toward that goal. We promise you an EP you'll never forget as well as new videos on our youtube and facebook page to help keep you guys constantly updated on our progress. We never forget an amazing fan and friend. </div>
<div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div>
<div>We can't tell you how much every bit of your donation means to us but we also realize times are tough and some of you just can't contribute at this time, and we absolutely understand that. You can still help us out by getting the word out about not only our name but our campaign by sharing our campaign on every possible social media outlet you own. When you do please tag us in the post and well give you a shout out!  There are also some indiegogo share buttons that make it really easy to share our campaign. Thank you guys so much for everything you've given us up to this point and the continued support. WE REALLY APPRECIATE EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU.  </div>

Approaching Troy is a 5 piece band based out of Long Island, NY. This band started as an outlet and solo project for lead singer/songwriter Jake Salazar, but during its  inception back in 2010, Jake had no idea how huge this project was really going to be. Fast forward to 2015, with the addition of Bassist Dom Bono, guitarists Jay Sutherland and Sean Doherty, drummer Joe Neglia and many goals accomplished the band is finally on their way to success. There's one problem though, we need your help. For the past 6 months, the band has worked diligently on their new EP, ""Dear Sadie"" from tracking, to recording, and are in the final steps of releasing this giant EP for us. Unfortunately, recording an album is unbelievably expensive. This is where we turn to you guys; our family, friends and most importantly the people who have showed us love and support since our very first show almost 4 years ago and now our brand new awesome fans as well.    What We Need & What You Get Here's the lowdown of the project. We need about $800 to finish this project including, recording costs, mastering, and duplication; but we don't just want to take your money; believe us thats the last thing we want to do. We have several perks just for believing in us and helping us achieve our dreams. These perks range from an Official Approaching Troy Bracelet, a signed copy of our new EP ""Dear Sadie"", when it comes out, a signed t-shirt, personalized Skype session with the band, to an in-house personal acoustic performance for you and your friends. (Check the side bar for more perks.) 

The Impact
We will be releasing our dream project, a 5 song EP that we believe will open new doors for us in the music industry and some awesome prizes will be given away for those who can contribute and help us toward that goal. We promise you an EP you'll never forget as well as new videos on our youtube and facebook page to help keep you guys constantly updated on our progress. We never forget an amazing fan and friend.

<div>We are two Italian brothers (Sebastiano and Federico) who live in Milan and music is our greatest passion.

<h3>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our project </span><br/>
</h3>
</div>
<div>We would like to make a website where you can <b>create your personal music CD</b>. On this website, called <b>Memo</b>, you can select all the characteristics of your own CD (number of compositions, CD cover's picture, the layout of the CD…). You can upload your tracks on the website directly from home and then you can send your ''virtual'' CD and wait for it to be made. We will create your dream CD, folllowing your instructions. Finally we will send you the CD and you will be able to listen to your music on your personal<b> CD!</b>
</div>
<div>Those who wish to sell their own music can do so through our website. You will find a specific section where you can upload your music and compositions and try to sell them to anybody who visits this section. This is called the <b>market section</b>. </div>
<div>In this way, anybody can start a CD market net without any third party!</div>
<div>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Why our project can be so useful</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>We think this project is going to be successful because having a CD with personal compositions can be a reason<b> of pride</b> for people who play and compose music, and, why not, it could be the beginning of something more.                                                                                                                                                                         </p>

</div></div>","Who we are

We are two Italian brothers (Sebastiano and Federico) who live in Milan and music is our greatest passion. We have studied it since we were children and we have always thought that people who live in music could have more opportunities to share their art.Our project is very simple and we think it could be very useful for all those who love music. We are now going to explain it. 




Our project 


We would like to make a website where you can create your personal music CD. On this website, called Memo, you can select all the characteristics of your own CD (number of compositions, CD cover's picture, the layout of the CD…). You can upload your tracks on the website directly from home and then you can send your ''virtual'' CD and wait for it to be made. We will create your dream CD, folllowing your instructions. Finally we will send you the CD and you will be able to listen to your music on your personal CD!

Those who wish to sell their own music can do so through our website. You will find a specific section where you can upload your music and compositions and try to sell them to anybody who visits this section. This is called the market section. 
In this way, anybody can start a CD market net without any third party!


Why our project can be so useful


We think this project is going to be successful because having a CD with personal compositions can be a reason of pride for people who play and compose music, and, why not, it could be the beginning of something more.                                                                                                                                                                         
Well, we want you to have a personal recording studio at home, in your computer!
How you can make use of your music CD
- A surprising and special gift
- The symbol of your music efforts
- A reason of pride 
- A strong motivation to improve yourself
- A collector's object

However, in order to make this project  we need a complete website. We need help to organize it, because programmers aren't free and we don't have much money! We need help to start our business and advertise Memo. We really hope we will reach our goal, because we really want to give people this exciting opportunity!
We hope you will find our idea interesting and you will support us in making it come true. 
Help us make Memo website! Help us make your music dream come true!
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING!

make folk pop music as <a href=""http://laurencemademecry.com/?page_id=2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Laurence Made Me Cry</a>.
In 2013 I released my debut album ‘<a href=""https://laurencemademecry.bandcamp.com/album/the-diary-of-me"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Diary Of Me</a>’ – I was very fortunate to collaborate
with many wonderful artists on this project and I’m very proud of what we
accomplished. I’m now ready to record my second album ‘Titans’ Daughters’ and I
need your help!</p>
<p>Writing for the record
is well underway and I’m very excited to be working with another group of
amazing collaborators. I’m in a very happy and creative place right now,
Scotland is treating me well and the music is flowing in new, thrilling
directions. My fascination with Greek mythology, in particular the nine muses,
is proving to be excellent songwriting fuel – they are muses after all! </p>
<p>I can’t make this record
without YOU. By contributing to this campaign YOU will help bring my stories to
life.</p>
<p><b>What The Muses Need &amp; What YOU Get</b></p>
<p>‘Titans’ Daughters’
will be recorded primarily by myself (much like my first record) but I’ll also
be heading into a professional studio to get some live drums recorded and a few
other instruments that might be a little too noisy even for the most understanding
of neighbours. I’ll be getting the album professionally mastered and I want to
make sure all my collaborators are well looked after too. Finally, some of the
funds raised will also help towards the CD productions costs.</p>
<p>There are lots of
interesting and unique perks available including handwritten and illustrated lyric/poetry

make folk pop music as Laurence Made Me Cry.
In 2013 I released my debut album ‘The Diary Of Me’ – I was very fortunate to collaborate
with many wonderful artists on this project and I’m very proud of what we
accomplished. I’m now ready to record my second album ‘Titans’ Daughters’ and I
need your help!
Writing for the record
is well underway and I’m very excited to be working with another group of
amazing collaborators. I’m in a very happy and creative place right now,
Scotland is treating me well and the music is flowing in new, thrilling
directions. My fascination with Greek mythology, in particular the nine muses,
is proving to be excellent songwriting fuel – they are muses after all! 
I can’t make this record
without YOU. By contributing to this campaign YOU will help bring my stories to
life.
What The Muses Need & What YOU Get
‘Titans’ Daughters’
will be recorded primarily by myself (much like my first record) but I’ll also
be heading into a professional studio to get some live drums recorded and a few
other instruments that might be a little too noisy even for the most understanding
of neighbours. I’ll be getting the album professionally mastered and I want to
make sure all my collaborators are well looked after too. Finally, some of the
funds raised will also help towards the CD productions costs.
There are lots of
interesting and unique perks available including handwritten and illustrated lyric/poetry
books, a nine muses inspired radio play (I kid you not) and my favourite perk -
a hand decorated lyre harp (the muses liked the lyre A LOT).

<p>     It's been a long time since I started writing songs and each step of the way I've grown as a musician.  I've finally reached the point in which I have the relationships to create a high quality project, but I want it to be so much more than that.  I want this EP to exemplify all the things that have made me, well... ME!  The best way I can imagine doing that is by getting everyone involved and really creating a community project.  Together we can make something greater than the sum of our parts.  Together we can take the next HUGE step in this musical journey.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>      There's no 2 ways around it... we need funds!  Don't worry though, it's not free money because every contribution receives something in return.  I have brainstormed with some of my most influential and supportive friends on how to create perks that are awesome/humorous/social/friendly/trendy (pick one... or ALL!)  I want everyone to feel like their investment means something, so EVERY donation will receive something personalized.  This EP doesn't happen without you and I am eternally indebted to everyone who contributes in ANY way.<br/></p>
<p>     In order to cover our base costs, we're going to need to raise around $6000 (that's including the cut that Indiegogo takes).  If we raise this, I'm super confident that we can make this dream a reality!  If we raise more, I have several secret ""unlocks"" hidden that will help make this project larger than life!  For those who like to know where their dollar is going (and why on EARTH it's so expensive to create art) here is the quick and dirty list of expenses that need to be covered:<br/></p> <ul> <li>Producer</li>

<li>If we do make our goal, AWESOME!  That was the whole plan!  I am dedicated to you guys 100% and will provide weekly (if not bi-weekly) updates as to the progress of the project.</li>
<li>I'm taking on the risk of my reputation with this project.  If I don't deliver, my stock as a musician/generally good person goes down!  As someone who wants to make a living doing this... it's a bad look.  I take this project as seriously as everyone donating *serious face*</li>
<li>I have created a lot of relationships with musicians/engineers/producers in the greater Seattle area in order to keep production time on schedule!  There will be no waiting months and months at a time because of unavailable studios/musicians/producers. <br/><br/>If you have any other questions PLEASE don't hesitate to ask!  Leave a comment or contact me on Twitter (@IsaiahD) Facebook (facebook.com/isaiahjdominguez) email (idominguezmusic@gmail.com).  I will answer any and ALL questions with 100% honesty.<br/>

 must raise money by donations as well.  Please give generously -- we

 are fortunate to have
assembled a wonderful cast of singers, most of whom have already 
thrilled the audiences of Opera in Williamsburg: Marco <span><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span>Nistico from our 
hilarious “Don Pasquale;” Yasmine Levi-Ellentuck and Claudia Chapa, who 
shone in our “Il Trovatore;”  and Sidney Outlaw, so
well received in our “Elisir d’Amore.” Joining them are Williamsburg-native Michelle Trovato and prize-winning tenor Cesar Delgado.  We are delighted that our 
Musical Director, Maestro Jorge Parodi, will again be wielding the baton
 for this exciting event.</span></p>
<p>It was a huge honor that David Nicholson of the “Daily Press” included 
both of our 2014 productions, “Don Pasquale” and “Lucia di Lammermoor,” 
in his list of the “Best Performances of 2014” in Tidewater Virginia 
(December 28).</p>
<p>Any place where excellent opera can take place is to be treasured.  Smaller opera companies like us fulfill a crucial need.  We can take risks that larger groups can't afford.  We have shown in all six of our previous productions that we know how to pick singers who are magnificent in their roles, and they relish the opportunity to work together.

<h3>I love opera, but I am not a big donor.  What can a person like me do?</h3>
<p>Give us what you would spend on a nice dinner.  Believe us, it will make a difference.  A significant portion of our budget is covered by ticket sales, but we must rely on donations as well to cover the expenses of each production.   Fractured Atlas, our fiscal sponsor, provides excellent oversight of our spending.  Direct donating is by far the most efficient way to support the performing arts.  Please give to the performing groups you love -- we can't do it without you.<br/></p> <h3>I really love opera and I love what you are doing, but I
can't do anything about it right now.

</h3>
<p>Yes you can!  We
treasure your good will.  Please tell
others about us.  Share our fund-raising drive and
tell your friends how you love what we do. </p>
<p>Even if you give just $10, your 
contribution matters.  If each of us gives just $10 we can do it!  Even if you can't, please 
tell your friends about us.  You can use Indiegogo share tools (on this
 page) .  A shout-out on Facebook or Twitter is worth a great
deal.  Thank you so much for

</div></div>","We are bringing to Williamsburg another masterpiece -- Mozart's brilliant comedy Cosi fan tutte, ""So Do They All,"" April 15 and 17 at the Kimball Theatre.   This is Mozart at 
his best, a sparkling evening of gorgeous melodies embedded in the 
diverting story of a (deliberate!) lovers' mix-up.
Ticket sales alone are not enough to cover the expense of opera.  We
 must raise money by donations as well.  Please give generously -- we 
can do it!
We
 are fortunate to have
assembled a wonderful cast of singers, most of whom have already 
thrilled the audiences of Opera in Williamsburg: Marco Nistico from our 
hilarious “Don Pasquale;” Yasmine Levi-Ellentuck and Claudia Chapa, who 
shone in our “Il Trovatore;”  and Sidney Outlaw, so
well received in our “Elisir d’Amore.” Joining them are Williamsburg-native Michelle Trovato and prize-winning tenor Cesar Delgado.  We are delighted that our 
Musical Director, Maestro Jorge Parodi, will again be wielding the baton
 for this exciting event.
It was a huge honor that David Nicholson of the “Daily Press” included 
both of our 2014 productions, “Don Pasquale” and “Lucia di Lammermoor,” 
in his list of the “Best Performances of 2014” in Tidewater Virginia 
(December 28).
Any place where excellent opera can take place is to be treasured.  Smaller opera companies like us fulfill a crucial need.  We can take risks that larger groups can't afford.  We have shown in all six of our previous productions that we know how to pick singers who are magnificent in their roles, and they relish the opportunity to work together.  
Check the video clips in the gallery of this fund-raising drive and see more at our web site, www.operainwilliamsburg.org
I love opera, but I am not a big donor.  What can a person like me do?
Give us what you would spend on a nice dinner.  Believe us, it will make a difference.  A significant portion of our budget is covered by ticket sales, but we must rely on donations as well to cover the expenses of each production.   Fractured Atlas, our fiscal sponsor, provides excellent oversight of our spending.  Direct donating is by far the most efficient way to support the performing arts.  Please give to the performing groups you love -- we can't do it without you. I really love opera and I love what you are doing, but I
can't do anything about it right now.


Yes you can!  We
treasure your good will.  Please tell
others about us.  Share our fund-raising drive and
tell your friends how you love what we do. 
Even if you give just $10, your 
contribution matters.  If each of us gives just $10 we can do it!  Even if you can't, please 
tell your friends about us.  You can use Indiegogo share tools (on this
 page) .  A shout-out on Facebook or Twitter is worth a great
deal.  Thank you so much for 

your love of opera and for your faith in Opera in Williamsburg!",4.0,0,"4 Campaigns

</div></div>","Short Summary
 This summer we are driving 12,000 miles on a cross country tour. Andrew is playing shows. Maura is doing publicity. We'll be experiencing the full beauty of the USA in over 40 cities across the country, and playing music along the way!

 America



We don't want to go on this tour at the expense of everyone else in the world, so the first $300 raised will go towards carbon offsets. 
All additional money will cover travel expenses.
If we can provide any value to you with the perks below, we'd be honored to have your help on this!


What We Need

We will be driving 12,000 miles in our 16mpg vehicle, and will be burning 750 gallons of gasoline and releasing 6.7 metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
Our ""Tour Bus""

We're going to offset 23 metric tons (more than 3x the tour's emissions) of CO2 with a $300 donation to the Improved Forest Management protocol of The City of Arcata Community Forest Barnum Tract via TerraPass. These are Green-e Climate Certified carbon offsets regulated by The Climate Action Reserve.

The rest of the funds will help cover travel expenses for the tour (gas, oil changes, parking, tolls, eating, basic necessities, not running out of money and being stranded in Kansas).


What You Get
 A postcard from a city of your choosing with our thanks for helping us fully experience the beauty of the USA.

<h3></h3>“Sometimes <em>it's the very people who no-one imagines anything of, that do the things that no-one can imagine</em>”. — <em>Alan Turing</em><br/><br/><b>LAUSD has significantly cut music from schools!</b><br/><br/>
<p>Raising money to operate! Help us bring music enrichment programs to children and youth in South Los Angeles <br/></p>
<p>Our Program:</p>
<p>1. Music/art enrichment programs Increasing graduation rate, secondary school rate and embracing self-expression through music and art <br/></p>
<p>2. Educational support and scholarships program</p>
<p>3. Mentors for our students through empowerment, encouragement and hope<br/></p>
<p>4. Decrease gang involvement and time spent in the street <br/></p>
<p>5. Family support <br/></p>
<h3>Let Music Heal </h3>
<p>
BENEFITS. Musicians have been reported to enhance
neurophysiological functions through learning to read music and play
instruments. Recent studies suggest musicianship is associated with cognitive
benefits for listening and learning, which included auditory memory and
attention, general intelligence, language processing and literacy skills.
Therefore musical interventions increase the probability of instilling favorable
behaviors in youth, which can then set them up for an increase in academic
performance in and out of the classroom. </p>
</div> <div> <h3>What's Needed: </h3>
<ul> <li>TRUST. Let's be real, asking for donations is difficult, especially from people you don't know and don't know you. Much of your donation is placed on faith and inherent trust that your money is going to where you think it is going, trust me, I get it.  <br/>
</li>
<li>PARTNERSHIPS. We are also seeking partnerships to create a collective impact and working collaborations<br/>
</li> <li>ACTION. Your generous donations will go to bring music and dance classes to disadvantaged children and youth <br/>
</li> <li>GOAL. Our is to raise enough money to operate by bringing the power of music, song and dance to disadvantaged children and youth <br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>We Need Your Help  <br/>
</h3> <p>STEPS TO TAKE:<br/></p> <ul> <li>1. Raise Funds</li>
<li>2. Advertise, market, get our name out!!! Fight For Humanity is a registered 501 (c)(3) nonprofit</li>
<li>Building capacity <br/>
</li>
<li>3. Build relationships... WE WANT YOU! <br/>
</li>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> IS FAILING A RISK?</p> <ul> <li>Sure, failing is always a risk when you are stepping out on faith and doing something alone, but someone who is so passionate about something, will always find a way. <br/>
</li>
<li>BIGGEST CHALLENGE. Continued funds.<br/>
</li>
<li>WON'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT. No, nothing changes overnight, but with the support we will be able to move much quicker. <br/>

Let Music Heal 

BENEFITS. Musicians have been reported to enhance
neurophysiological functions through learning to read music and play
instruments. Recent studies suggest musicianship is associated with cognitive
benefits for listening and learning, which included auditory memory and
attention, general intelligence, language processing and literacy skills.
Therefore musical interventions increase the probability of instilling favorable
behaviors in youth, which can then set them up for an increase in academic
performance in and out of the classroom. 
  What's Needed: 
 TRUST. Let's be real, asking for donations is difficult, especially from people you don't know and don't know you. Much of your donation is placed on faith and inherent trust that your money is going to where you think it is going, trust me, I get it.  

PARTNERSHIPS. We are also seeking partnerships to create a collective impact and working collaborations
 ACTION. Your generous donations will go to bring music and dance classes to disadvantaged children and youth 
 GOAL. Our is to raise enough money to operate by bringing the power of music, song and dance to disadvantaged children and youth 
    We Need Your Help  
 STEPS TO TAKE:  1. Raise Funds
2. Advertise, market, get our name out!!! Fight For Humanity is a registered 501 (c)(3) nonprofit
Building capacity 

3. Build relationships... WE WANT YOU! 

   Risks & Challenges  IS FAILING A RISK?  Sure, failing is always a risk when you are stepping out on faith and doing something alone, but someone who is so passionate about something, will always find a way. 

BIGGEST CHALLENGE. Continued funds.

WON'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT. No, nothing changes overnight, but with the support we will be able to move much quicker.

<br/><p><b>Abendmusik</b>, New York’s Early Music String
Band, showcases the rarely-performed repertoire composed during and after one
of the most devastating periods in the Germanic region’s history, the 30 Years
War <img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src=""""/>(1618 –
1648).  The term “Abendmusik” refers to the free concert series
established by the organist Franz Tunder in Lübeck churches in the 17th century
and further cultivated by North German composer Dieterich Buxtehude in the
early 18th century.  Abendmusik
programs featured sacred and secular
vocal and instrumental solo and chamber works. 
The series became so popular, as a result of free admission and featured
compositions, that it grew into a respectable cultural institution.  We explore the repertoire of countries
that  influenced  German composers (Italy, the Hapsburg Empire of
Austria and Spain, Poland, Holland, England, Denmark and France) as well as the
regional styles of German composers associated with specific principalities
through the period during and after the war. The end result is a fusion of
styles and the ultimate establishment of a German national style we
associate with J. S. Bach, Georg Philipp Telemann, George Friderich Handel and
others.</p>
<p>The members of the ensemble individually enjoy distinguished careers in historically-informed
academic and performance fields and have appeared with many high-profile early
music ensembles including: The American Classical Orchestra, Aston Magna, Boston
Camerata, The Boston Early Music Festival Orchestra, Consort Royal, Early Music
New York, Glimmerglass Opera, Lionheart, New York City Opera, The New York Consort
of Viols, New York Grande Bande, Parthenia, Rebel, Sequentia,The Smithsonian
Chamber Orchestra and Viol Consort, The Smithson Quartet, Trinity Baroque, Washington
Bach Consort, and many more.  Together the
members of <b>Abendmusik</b> contribute their professional
experience, talent and scholarship, to create and present programs that are
informative, showcase virtuosity, sensitivity and creativity, and most
importantly leave the audience wanting more. </p>

I started the band while living in Lahaina, Maui, Hi and started it again with new members in Encinitas, San Diego when I moved back home. We've been playing for several years all over San Diego, Orange County, and even a little down in Mexico. In 2008 I rushed a quick debut EP just to get something out there to help us book shows. I've never really been stoked on that. I started this campaign because last year Hazmatt got in the studio again with some real material we are proud and passionate about but we were only able to finish one single out of the 6 song EP. The band and I fund the project with the majority being funded by myself. Last year my lady left my daughter and I and I have been a full-time single parent since then with no extra money to spare and this project stuck on indefinite hold. I play music because I love it, it makes me happy, and helps me feed my daughter and I. This new album is very important to us, as we all contributed to writing the songs and we think they are the best we've got to offer. We'd love to get them out there for better or for worse to share or work with our family and friends and hopefully help further our musical endeavor by helping us to book more gigs and tours and help me to possibly give my daughter a better life through the music I love to play. I created an IndieGoGo campaign last May and started out strong but due to a personal loss of a close friend I gave up on it and focused on other stuff more important at the time. I'm starting it again because the donations made last time got me back in the studio and fired up to work!!<br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Goal</h3> <p>I've aimed for the low end of what we need. We spent several grand just finishing a single off of this project last year so this is a very conservative number to start with. Here are the costs associated with finishing the EP:</p> <ul> <li>Recording at LA Lounge Studios is $50 an hour. That's a bargain considering we get two for one in that our sound engineer also offers great production on the songs. We have drums and bass tracked on all songs, some guitar, and some vocals. We need to track guitar, percussion, keyboards, some horns, and vocal. Mixing and mastering each song is generally around $250 per song for the mix and master.</li> <li>I will be offering perks of copies of the finished project and surf lessons for donors. </li> <li>Even if we don't reach our donation goal all money will be put in to the project and we won't stop until it's accomplished.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>We are so proud of this new album and the songs we've written together as a band. Everyone in the band is a family man with children and we love music, but we also depend on the extra income we get for playing gigs. Not only will this album be great for us to be able to release for friends and family in just an artistic sense of completing a project we love, it will also help increase the opportunity of us getting better exposure with a better recording. This new album can potentially help us receive more radio and media exposure as well as open more doors to bigger gigs and festivals and touring. We'd love to be able to travel and spread our music to a larger audience and also help feed our families doing what we love. This is the first time we've attempted a venture like this, as we have always done it on our own and I have personally funded almost all the band's recording and traveling on my own. I'm in a situation where I cannot do it on my own anymore and I don't want to give up. We've been getting great feedback from the only single released off the album so far which has already helped us get one tour and some small local radio play. We're ready to take it to the next level!<br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The challenge will always be coming up with money to make it as good as it can be. There's no risk of not making it happen, just a risk of it taking awhile to do it on our own.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We know everyone isn't in the position to give money but there are many other ways to lend support:<br/></p> <ul> <li>Spread the word and share our campaign with your friends and family that may be able to help.</li>
<li>Donate goods that we can add as perks to the campaign funders. </li>
<li>Book us to play a show and we can put that money towards the project.</li>
<li>Pass us on to friends that may need a band for an event.

</p>
<p><b>A Little About Me!</b></p>
<p>My name is Zepherine Poirier-Feraud, I am 17 and have been playing the
harp, and singing, for 10 years. My journey in music started on a 1/8-sized
violin when I was five. By age seven I discovered the harp and never looked
back! </p>
<p>During the last four years I have participated in Royal Conservatory of
Music examinations and the Kiwanis Music Festival in harp, choral and vocal
performances. I have been lucky to receive both Gold and Silver recognition
certificates and, in 2013, I received the Musical Arts Club Award Bursary. </p>
<p>I am starting my last year at Canterbury High School in the Vocal Arts
program (unfortunately they don't offer a harp program). This past spring, I was
accepted into the Young Artist Harp Seminar in Atlanta, Georgia (boot camp for
harps!). This experience really helped me see that the harp is the instrument I
was meant to play.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span><span><span></span></span></span><span></span></p>
<p><b>Why a crowd-sourcing campaign?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>I have now decided to study the harp in university. That means I must
purchase a full-sized orchestral harp. The instrument I currently play is
actually a small harp with just 40 strings. An orchestral harp has 47 strings
and a far larger sound board to produce a bigger, bolder and more magnificent
voice. There aren’t many harp manufacturers in the world. One of the oldest and
most respected is Lyon &amp; Healy in the United States. </p>
<p>The model I have decided to purchase is a Style 30 Concert Grand ebony
harp. It was selected in Chicago by one of my teachers, a renowned professional
harpist, especially for me. The cost of the harp, when you add the harp
cover, shipping, exchange and taxes, is $40,000.</p>
<p>My family has been very supportive, with their well timed bear hugs
(Sacha, Noah and Kai!), long drives to lessons and concerts (Mom), perfectly
timed chocolate treats (Dad) and above all, a belief in my love of creating
music. With this fundraising campaign, I hope to raise funds to pay a portion
of the total cost of the harp. In this way I can give back to my family.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get<br/>
</h3>
<b>Here's My Plan:</b>
</div><div>
<p>
</p>
<p>I want to raise $8,325 to go towards the purchase of
the harp. This is less than 1/3 of the total cost. I plan to sell my old harp,
which should raise an additional $12,000. With this amount, I should be able to
cover half the total price of the harp. I plan to supplement this with $8,000 that
I will make working with my new harp, such as performing at weddings and
special events. The remaining $12, 000 will be paid for by my parents.</p>
<b>Don't Forget to Check-Out the
Perks!</b><br/>
<p>The best part about donating to my campaign is the Perks. I have a whole
range of special opportunities for donors, such as a ticket to my first concert
with THE new harp! Or maybe you always wanted to try and play the harp. I’ll be
offering a limited number of short lessons so you can try it out for yourself.
If you have an upcoming event I’ll be booking through the campaign (harps are
ideal for weddings). If you only have $20 to spare you can get one of my new
recordings (to hear me play and sing, you can check out my web-site).</p>
<br/><h3>The Impact<br/>
</h3>
<p>With a small donation you can make a big impact in the way I develop as
a musician. This new harp will allow me to pursue my studies in university,
learn repertoire that I cannot currently play on my smaller harp and allow me
to expand my recordings.</p>
<p>My teacher best described why it is important to have a good instrument
as a developing musician:</p>
<p>“In sports and many other fields, the quality of one's tools and
equipment can have a major influence on the product. A musician faces a similar
challenge in that, as he/she attains a greater level of proficiency, it becomes
more and more important to have the right tool. For a harpist, the development
of sound production, true strength and resonance without bodily tension,
control over a wide dynamic spectrum, and varying tone colours, requires
consistent practice on an instrument without limitations. Although the tool
itself does not make the artist or the athlete great, dedicated training and
practice using that tool can lead to greatness.”</p>

Well, there is nothing wrong with classical music, in fact, classical music lifts your soul and makes you a better person (not sure about the better person part or even the soul lifting part, but you get the point, right?), but because we love other kinds of music as well (like pop and rock, not so much death metal, though), we started arranging pop songs and we are absolutely lovin' it (and we are sure, you will love it too)!<p></p>

After having a serious Heart Attack on August 15th, SPIDA is now Strong Enough to Have bypass Surgery; it has been scheduled for Thursday 17th September .He will need time to recover from the surgey and be unable to work for sometime ,So we are asking His Friends And Fans who I know will be Missing his Wonderful songs to Please Donate what you can here, the Last thing SPIDA needs now is to be stressed about Money. In Exchange SPIDA has made a special List of Songs he feels Appropriate right now , You can download them from a specially set up bandcamp.com page,  listed below.This fundraising initiative is being coordinated by Emer, Spida´s girlfriend and Diana, Spida´s longtime friend and fan. We just want to ensure that Spida can relax and take his time to recover from a double bypass surgery before having to perform again.Without this financial backing that we are hoping that his friends, family and fans, old and new will provide, Spida will be under great pressure to return to performing before he´s has had time to recuperate.So if you make a contribution towards Spida´s recovery you will receive FREE downloads of some of his original songs, so its a WIN-WIN situation for everyone.Spida has been sharing his music with people around the world since he started on the folk circuit in the UK when he was 17 performing under his own name Martin Carter, lets get together to give him the support so that he can continue sharing his songs and light in the future.TO SAY THANKS FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS WE HAVE SET UP A SPECIAL BANDCAMP.COM PAGE WITH ORIGINAL SPIDA SONGS FOR FREE DOWNLOAD.

<p>We are an indie rock band out of Chico, Ca. We have been together for over 3 years and in that time we have created 2 albums, gone on multiple tours as far out as Colorado and Texas and everywhere in-between, and have been recognized as Best Rock Act of 2015 for our music regionally. We are a passionate trio, drawing from many genres, including Soul, Blues, Americana, Lo-Fi Rock and old world styles like waltzes, tangos, and circus marches. The common thread throughout the music is that it's all a bit dark, romantic, tongue in cheek, with a focus on storytelling and eclectic composition. </p>
<p>We are finally ready to release our third album into the world and we need your help to do it! Now that the hard part is done and the music is written, we need to RECORD it, PRODUCE it, and DISTRIBUTE it. It is important to us to release only the highest quality sound, using the best technology, so that you, the listener, get the best experience possible. One way we are doing this is to have all the tracks on this album mastered at the famous ABBEY ROAD recording studio. Also, it would be a dream come true to be able to offer this album on vinyl. PLEASE HELP MAKE OUR DREAMS COME TRUE!</p>
<p>Thank you for checking us out and showing your support. We love what we do, and hope you do too!</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>After doing extensive research and calculations, we have set our goal at $8324.

<li>Send all the tracks to Abbey Road for Mastering</li>

<p>We have decided to part ways with our old record label. And this is GREAT news. Now we can offer you our music (and other exciting things) without having a middle-man.</p>
<p>So far in our band's career we have released an album ('Sintrinity'), an EP ('The Nemesis EP') and a single ('Wicked'). And now it's time for us to make our most epic piece of music ever: <b>'INCONTROVERTIBLE'</b>.</p>
<p>'Incontrovertible' have one big thing in common with our first, critically acclaimed album: The whole album will be a story from beginning to end. We have the broad picture of the story written and also have recorded the first song.</p>
<p>The main problem we are facing is that we need time &amp; money to make this album happen. 'Sintrinity' took four years to write, record &amp; release. Four. Years. And if we don't get any help from you guys, this album will suffer the same destiny. </p>
<p>We love to make music and can't wait to share it with you. We have so many musical ideas we want you to hear, and a great story that will make the picture complete.</p>
<p>Crowdfunding is a way for supporters of a band to know exactly where their hard earned dollars are going. No middlemen, no commissions, no crap at all.</p><p><br/></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>ALL of the fundings we get through this campaign will go back into making the album. As a thank-you for believing in our vision about the album, we will give you some unique perks that won't be available after this campaign. </p>
<p> We are set up for Flex Funding which means if we don't reach our goal, we are still getting the money that is raised. Regardless of how our campaign plays out, we will record this album. The biggest difference is gonna be at what time we will be ready to release it.  </p><p><br/></p>
<h3>The Effect</h3>
<p>By taking part in this you are taking charge and helping to change how we make music. You are putting faith in us. And that is meaning the world to us. We. Won't Let. You. Down. If you have heard our previous work, you know that everything we do is from the heart. We never release a song if it doesn't give ourselves chills. It's actually true. If we don't get those feelings from our songs, how can we expect you to get them?</p>
<p>Don't take are word for it. Just listen to our previous work.</p>
<p>The money we raise will give us an oppurtunity to get even better sound quality, and also give us the amazing chance to totally dive into creating music together. You see, we got a bit of a problem. 'morph' consists of two members only, and we live quite far apart from each other. Because of expensive travelling costs, we can't see each other as much as we like to. With your help, we could actually meet and create music like never before.</p>
<p>Here's to making our best album yet.</p>

<p>Every dollar is appreciated. But if you don't have the opportunity to spend a bit of money yourself – there are other ways you can help out. Spread the word!

</div></div>","Take 90+ talented teenagers and ask them to share a message of hope through music and the arts, and magic happens. 


The message itself becomes part of the lives of those who share it.

The singers, instrumentalists, artists, dancers and actors realize they posses talents which can be used to benefit others.
Concerts are only part of what we do.  We also lead mini-arts camps with disadvantaged youth we visit while touring.  We give teddy-bears to children in hospitals, work in soup kitchens, do art projects in homeless shelters, visit homebound seniors and nursing homes.  We have even performed ""flash-mob"" concerts in subway cars, malls and government buildings.  



What We Need & What You Get

 This year's tour is taking us into communities throughout New England, with a special concentration on the inner cities of Baltimore and Boston.  Our single largest expense with a group this size is lodging.  We need your help to have a place to stay while we work.  Lodging for two nights in Boston will cost us $10,500.  These are not ""fancy"" accommodations.  Housing 90+ people is an expensive thing to do. We are asking, through this Indiegogo campaign, for help in raising $7,500 of this total. If we do not reach our entire goal, whatever is raised will be used to supplement what we hope to earn through other sources.  Everything you donate, less the platform fee, will benefit our efforts. 
In exchange for your contribution, we are offering a wide variety of premiums with each donation.  A live CD or DVD recording of our homecoming concert, a copy of a tour journal compiled from comments of our youth as we travel, a t-shirt designed especially for this year's tour, and greeting cards designed by our visual arts group are all premiums being offered this year in appreciation of your support.   The Impact Since 1996, Crossflame Youth Choir and Orchestra has successfully provided rich opportunities to combine the arts with community service in our local community and beyond.  Each summer, we travel away from the friendly confines of the world we know to places most of our members have never seen.  Our experiences help us to see the world differently; to personally share with others; to learn that in so many ways, we are interconnected with the world around us.  And of course, we learn that we CAN make a difference.   Risks & Challenges Raising a significant portion of each year's touring costs is not easy.  But with your help, we can make it happen.  This is not our only fundraising campaign, but it is a very important one because it allows us to reach people who are not normally part of our immediate support group.  As our group has grown over the past few years (doubled in size since 2010), we rely more and more on our Indiegogo campaigns for support. 
    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:  Get the word out and make some noise about our campaign!  Share with your friends, family and co-workers.

The band consists of drummer Nicholas Anderson, bassist Ari Folman-Cohen, and Kevin Moehringer on trombone.   For the last several years we have honed our sound playing shows at venues around New York City. I have been playing music with Nick and Ari in several different bands since I moved to New York 8 years ago, and we have a wonderful chemistry as colleagues and as friends. The music on this album has come together through playing shows and workshopping the material, and I think we have something really special that most everyone will enjoy.  The recordings we have so far are sounding incredible, I am so excited to share this music with everyone!  </div> <p><span style=""font-size: 24px; line-height: 30px;""><b><br/></b></span></p>

<p>There is so much negativity out there in the world,
especially in music. I get it. Bad things happen. People get their hearts
broken, lovers cheat, and people we love leave us. But even when those things
happen; no, ESPECIALLY when those things happen, people need to know that
there’s still hope, somehow, someway, there’s always hope that a brighter
tomorrow is headed our way. The purpose of this CD is to bring a little
positivity into the darkness of this world we live in.</p>
<p><b>Why This Project?</b></p>
<p>This is my sophomore album. In my first project, I was
really just exploring who I was as an artist. That first CD was great. I
learned a lot about the kind of music I like to write and sing, and the kind I
don’t. This project is designed to showcase who Grant Harrison is as a musician
and artist. The sound is uniquely my own, but I often say it’s a beautiful
blend of the light-heartedness of Jack Johnson and the soulful depth of Maroon
Five. </p>
<p><b>Why Now?</b></p>
<p>Recently I was interviewed by Jake McKim, Beyoncé’s A&amp;R Consultant. Of the many artists he’s talked to, he selected me as one of his top
artists to work with, but he gave me a long list of things I have to accomplish,
including narrow and define my sound (which I have done) and write and produce
a CD that is professionally produced by a top-notch studio.</p>
<p><b>Why You?</b></p>
<p>Many of you are the very people who encouraged me to go
after a career in music. You recognized something in me that I didn’t even know
was there. You purchased my first album and you came to my shows. You celebrated
with me when I was selected to perform in a big showcase in Los Angeles, and
you were the first to know when I was signed to a publishing and management deal with April
Sound Entertainment Group who connected me with Reel Muzik Werks to write original songs for licencing to the television
and the motion picture industry.</p>
<p>And you’re here now, encouraging me to continue on this
crazy journey. To produce the five song CD that Jake McKim wants to help me get produced
I need to raise $35,000. That money will cover:</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Working with top songwriters in the industry</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Recording each of the five songs</p>
<p><span>·<span>

<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Traveling to other areas in the country to talk
with people in the industry</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Working with Jake McKim</p>
<p><b>Why Me?</b></p>
<p>That’s a question I keep asking myself. I can’t believe this
incredible opportunity is here in front of me, but I’m so grateful for it, and
I promise to make the most of it with your help.</p>

</p><p>Nashville
Or Bust</p>
<p>What is it? More importantly, why should you support it?</p>
<p>Nashville Or Bust is about more then one musician trying to
raise money to pursue a singular dream. Yes it is also that but the dream in
question has many facets and many of those I hope will benefit my fellow
songwriters and performers. I am lucky to be a part of a very talented music
and art community in Central Oregon. From
writers to performers the roster of musical folks here in Bend, Oregon
rivals that of much bigger cities. But as with most things in life, success in
music has as much to do with opportunity and location as it does with talent
and experience. While the internet has made location less of a factor it still
has an effect on who gets heard, noticed and offered work on a larger scale. I
have had a trip to Nashville
in my mind for years.....maybe decades. But either my songwriting was not, in
my opinion, at a level to be successful in a town filled with the best or the
ever challenging factor for us musicians......money kept me from taking that
leap. Now I am 47, I have a batch of songs I truly believe in and well to be
honest I can hear the clock ticking on this career bucket list item. So I came
up with a plan and that plan continues to grow.</p>
<p>Ok so money is still the biggest factor. I work teaching
guitar and vocals and perform a lot. But to fund my family and other life stuff
and plan this tour/venture/dream is impossible, hence this campaign. SO....not
asking for a hand out....but truly a hand up 
in financing this business venture. </p>
<p>I have a company called Miller Entertainment Media (M.E.M)
that I hope to develop in to a publishing/talent/media company. I intend to use
this Nashville Or Bust venture to launch this idea. Once I have spent the time
needed in Nashville my goal is not only to launch my songwriting goals but to also
be in a position of influence or association that will enable M.E.M to then
sign on songwriters and performers from my musical community in order to
promote and connect them to work in Nashville and in the over all entertainment
field. From songwriting contracts to session work to career coaching and
development M.E.M is my hope that I can make something big happen, not just for
myself, but for all those other artists I know. The industry has changed a lot
in the past decade and new, cutting edge methods are the way to find success
now........I hope!!</p>
<p>I have spent 35 years working in music and media in some
fashion. From performing, writing, session work and my time in radio I have
collected a large amount of both connections in the field and experience for
how it all works. I am now hoping to take all of that and make it mean
something for me and many others. If you help fund the Nashville Or Bust
campaign the money will go to facilitating marketing, recording and travel for
a two month trip/tour to Nashville.
I am currently booking a short tour of 6-10 stops between Bend
and Nashville
to make the travel easier, add funds to the cause and get me in top performing
shape by the time I get there. Once in Nashville
I will spend my time working getting my songs heard, selling others on my idea
and opening as many doors as I can to succeed. I have several people who can
and are willing to help along the way with introductions and performance
opportunities while there. </p>
<p>If this all succeeds then I hope to be able to regularly
submit mine and my friends songs for consideration to be recorded by other
artists or licensed to other media, like films, tv, web etc. This will be a
building process and won't happen over night. But I feel confident that with
your support I can make this dream come true and through that start making
other artists dreams come true as well. </p>
<p>So if you feel so inspired please contribute to the future
of not just mine but many musicians futures. There are some perks listed here of
cool stuff you can get in thanks for your support. From t-shirts and guitar
picks to custom songs and even house concerts, there are many ways to support.
