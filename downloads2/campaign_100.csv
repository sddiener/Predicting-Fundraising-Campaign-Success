<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The only challenge we have is NOT reaching our financial goal. If we reach the goal, everything is going to move forward with the construction of the museum. The only possible challenges we could foresee are minor delays with building permits, or minor administrative delays. But other than these typical issues with general contracting, the project will go as planned.</p>

<h3>Cirkus in Quarantine: </h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>I'm a circus clown who</strong>, due to relocating to New York City just before a pandemic, has rediscovered my visual arts skills.</li>
<li>The pandemic has <strong>removed live audiences for circus artists</strong>, and that is what we live for. </li>
<li>
<strong>The Bindlestiff Family Cirkus</strong> created an online variety show, and I stepped in as the ""unofficial"" archivist, creating watercolor illustrations of each show.</li>
<li>The main perk here is a book collecting said watercolors over the last year: <strong>49 art works from 48 shows, </strong>hundreds of hours sweating blood at my easel, featuring over <strong>400 circus acts</strong>, representing <strong>thousands of years</strong> of circus experience.</li>
<li>Your participation will get you this <strong>unique piece of circus history</strong> and support the visual artist who has not asked for, nor received, compensation for his efforts. This campaign aims to rectify that as it gets an incredible keepsake into your hands.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other Stuff:</h3>

<li><p><strong>These books are available by pre-order only. </strong>Self-publishing an art book is expensive. I will not carry a stock. If you do not pre-order, I may re-order sometime, but the cost will be much less palatable for smaller print runs.</p></li>
<li>
<strong>Additional perks you may want</strong>: original artwork; a quick black and white sketch of a single subject doing something circus-y. </li>
<li>
<strong>More involved original artwork, in full color</strong>, to your specifications. Of a favorite circus act, perhaps, or of an amusing scene.</li>

<h3>Past successes</h3>

<li>You may remember my past (successful) crowdfunding campaigns for Clown Cabaret's shows, ""<strong>Delusions of Grandeur</strong>"" (Kickstarter) and ""<strong>The Heist</strong>"" (Indiegogo). Both projects got off the ground due to people like you, and we developed both shows and brought them to venues in Washington DC, around Maryland, Baltimore, and New York City.</li>
<li>This is now a solo venture, so I hope it works out. </li>

Once, it was my desire to create a portfolio of highly distressed, antiqued photographs depicting well-known historical personages (Attila the Hun, Julius Caesar, Joan of Arc), as if they had simply shown up at my door requesting that I make their portrait. For several reasons (the difficulty of finding suitable models and period appropriate costumes), those first attempts were unsatisfactory and, in time, I moved from Los Angeles to a rural Texas town, where I soon forgot about the project.</p>
<p>After several years, during which I sporadically attended a local <strong>Renaissance faire</strong>, a friend reminded me of the earlier project, and suggested that most of the heavy lifting had already been done by the wonderful characters encountered at the faire, with their fantastic costumes, armor, and period accessories. My friend further suggested I try my hand at a <strong>Tarot deck</strong>, about which I knew little at the time.</p>
<p>I decided to experiment with a single card, <strong>The Fool</strong>, and, if pleased with the result, would continue. To my great delight, <strong>The Fool</strong> far exceeded my expectations.</p>

<p>Through trial and error I was able to create a 22-card deck of Majors giving the impression of an authentic medieval tarot. Clearly, such vintage decks were already in existence, but mine would be different: <strong>The Lost Tarot</strong> would consist entirely of photographs, the idea being they were created with a crude prototype box camera (a camera obscura) nearly three and a half centuries before the actual invention of the first cameras in 1839.</p>
<p><strong>In 2017, I released the 22 images of the Major Arcana + the 4 aces of the Minor Arcana first, in order to sample the public's appetite for my creation</strong>.</p>

<p>Back in 2017 I decided to take the project a step further by creating a fictitious historical background explaining how <strong>The Lost Tarot</strong> came into existence, the deck being the brainchild of an English wool merchant, <strong>William Bradford</strong>, whose chance encounter with <strong>Leonardo da Vinci</strong> on the Continent resulted in the purchase of a design for an optical device (the first camera), leading to the making of the first known photographs, i.e., <strong>The Lost Tarot</strong>, how in 1994 the deck was discovered buried in a Nottingham farmer’s field, and how the use of digital tools allowed for its restoration.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Here is the text for <strong>William Bradford's Testamentum</strong> in its entirety:</p>
<h2>THE LOST TAROT</h2>
<p><strong>A CHRONICLE OF THE CURIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES RELATING TO ITS ORIGINS AND PARTICULARS</strong></p>
<p>From the Journals of the Wool Merchant <strong>William Bradford</strong></p>
<p>(<i>b. Feb 28, 1488—d. Dec 13, 1555</i>) Nottingham, England</p>
<h3><i>Testamentum: William Bradford</i></h3>
<p><i>Let it be known:</i></p>
<p><i>So it was that under the wise legislation of Henry the Seventh, a commercial treaty having been struck with the Florentine Republic, under which English merchants undertook to carry every year to Florence sufficient wool to supply all the Italian city states, saving Venice, in the Year of Our Lord 1504, I traveled to Florence for the purpose of delivering much desired Nottingham wool to receive the proper purple dye, in which the Italians much exceeded our English ability.</i></p>
<p><i>It was there as a young apprentice to an English trader that I chanced to encounter the esteemed Florentine, Leonardo da Vinci, a polymath of extraordinary vision; painter, sculptor, architect, and anatomist, prone to uncanny technological design and invention; wings for flying, a mechanical knight, a steam cannon, and shoes for walking on water.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1631915955/a3100z8ily96lbf21uzf.jpg"" src=""""/></i></p>
<p><i>Of particular interest to myself, the genius da Vinci envisioned an optical device, a camera obscura, for the capture of sun pictures; a boxlike contraption of wood, and a lens of ground glass, the pictures themselves formed through the application of chemicals on coated glass, the principal being first noted by the Greek philosopher and scientist Aristotle; how light passing through a small hole into a darkened room produces an image on the opposite wall.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1631916007/om3ttznjwsc0srm2exfe.jpg"" src=""""/></i></p>
<p><i>My master, who held me in some favor, and knew of my desire, purchased for me several of da Vinci’s drawings, the most intriguing being a design for the creation of sun pictures. Having returned to England, I became obsessed with da Vinci’s novelty, and how it might be brought to practical use. To this end, having become a polished gentleman of some considerable means, I employed various tradesmen to fashion different parts of the apparatus: the blacksmith Ulric Baynard for the construction of mechanical parts, Drogo Karolus, a grinder of finely crafted lenses, and Hugh Gaillard, the apothecary, for chemicals and imaging glass, until at last—Eureka!</i></p>
<p><i>Beyond the blush of first astonishment, which cannot here be overstated, being a soul of largely pragmatic considerations, myself possessing no skill as a draftsman or painter, but being an appreciator of the arts, I set my mind to how the device might be used in the service of creating a personal vision beyond that of still life, portraiture, and landscape.</i></p>
<p><i>Thereafter, I several times set sail for the boot in the sea, and upon occasion bought more drawings. It was during one such trip that I first encountered a new form of entertainment; a game of heavily colored playing cards the Italians called trionfi, or triumphs.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1631916044/qmtcfmskmde265xjtuo7.jpg"" src=""""/></i></p>
<p><i>These I acquired by barter for my own amusement, in exchange for Nottingham wool. Upon further study, I understood the game to be a disguise for a powerful set of esoteric images forming a system of divination. From that point, I became consumed by deciphering the cards, and determined to make images for my own tarot.</i></p>
<p><i>Working in secrecy, certain that servants of the inquisition at the profane direction of certain members of the Holy Church would view the endeavor as the work of the devil—divination being a pastime of the King of Hell, punishable by torture and death—I enjoined family and trusted members of the good folk of Nottingham to sit for me, and so, the Great Work began.</i></p>
<p><i>Well set upon my task, following in the manner of the Italian Tarot in the use of code and symbol, I further sought the aid of the Flemish painter, Franz van Eyck, for the creation, where necessary, of fauna, floral, and varied adornment applied directly to the glass plates.</i></p>
<p><i>After eleven years of trial and considerable error, the undertaking was brought to completion.</i></p>
<p><i>It was shortly after the completion of the Nottingham Tarot that I learned of the death of the virtuoso, da Vinci, the great man’s spirit having flown, God rest his soul, Amen, in 1519, in France, where he spent his last days, while under the sponsorship of the French monarch, Francis I, although the news did not reach me until many months after the event. Having no wish to lay claim to the remarkable invention without giving due credit to the master, it was my fondest wish that I return to Italy and demonstrate its use, but it was not to be.</i></p>
<p><i>During the great epidemic of the sweating sickness in 1528, I hid the opus, leaving instruction with my eldest, Merek, and with my solicitor, in the event of my death. They, however, God rest their souls, preceded me in their ascent to Holy Heaven.</i></p>
<p><i>Having several times been visited by member of the clergy, who wished to know about the strange device, I pled innocence and claimed no knowledge of it, attributing the rumor of its existence to a rival businessman who wished to cause me grief and usurp my share of trade.</i></p>
<p><i>Now, myself gravely ill and approaching imminent death, in the spirit of the enigmatic undertaking that has consumed me these two and fifty years, I make my final entry: regarding the fruit of my labor and blessed vision born under the direction of the Mage da Vinci, and wishing dearly that it not be lost forever, the treasure trove lies buried somewhere in Dear England. May they who discovers its whereabouts do with it as they will.</i></p>
<p><strong><i>By me—William Bradford.</i></strong></p>

Being a treasury of mysterious providence in the pursuit of arcane knowledge, originating from a chance encounter with the Renaissance polymath Leonardo da Vinci, resulting in The Great Work. 
The whole splendidly enriched with seventy-eight cards of medieval imagery, including emperors, empresses, kings, queens, knights and their retinues, also a mage, a hierophant, the lovers, and the common folk of feudal England at the time of Henry VIII. 
Replete with the esteemed images The Fool, Justice, the Queen of Coins, The Star, Death, the Six of Cups, and The World.
The Great Work created with the cooperation of the good citizens of Nottingham under the direction of the former wool merchant William Bradford. 
On occasion continuing the work of esteemed calligraphers, vaunted miniaturists, deceased painters and anonymous engravers, but deriving primarily from the mind and eye of the photographer Hansjurgen Bauer.

I, Hansjurgen Bauer, have long had an interest in photo-based art. Once, it was my desire to create a portfolio of highly distressed, antiqued photographs depicting well-known historical personages (Attila the Hun, Julius Caesar, Joan of Arc), as if they had simply shown up at my door requesting that I make their portrait. For several reasons (the difficulty of finding suitable models and period appropriate costumes), those first attempts were unsatisfactory and, in time, I moved from Los Angeles to a rural Texas town, where I soon forgot about the project.
After several years, during which I sporadically attended a local Renaissance faire, a friend reminded me of the earlier project, and suggested that most of the heavy lifting had already been done by the wonderful characters encountered at the faire, with their fantastic costumes, armor, and period accessories. My friend further suggested I try my hand at a Tarot deck, about which I knew little at the time.
I decided to experiment with a single card, The Fool, and, if pleased with the result, would continue. To my great delight, The Fool far exceeded my expectations.

Through trial and error I was able to create a 22-card deck of Majors giving the impression of an authentic medieval tarot. Clearly, such vintage decks were already in existence, but mine would be different: The Lost Tarot would consist entirely of photographs, the idea being they were created with a crude prototype box camera (a camera obscura) nearly three and a half centuries before the actual invention of the first cameras in 1839.
In 2017, I released the 22 images of the Major Arcana + the 4 aces of the Minor Arcana first, in order to sample the public's appetite for my creation.

Continuing my experiment, one card led to another, until several years and thousands of hours later, I had created the 78-Card Edition of The Lost Tarot.

The majority of the primary elements were photographed over the course of several years. A handful of images were staged and photographed at my home studio and surrounding areas. Some costumes, accessories, and armor for these images were created and shipped from distant lands.

Back in 2017 I decided to take the project a step further by creating a fictitious historical background explaining how The Lost Tarot came into existence, the deck being the brainchild of an English wool merchant, William Bradford, whose chance encounter with Leonardo da Vinci on the Continent resulted in the purchase of a design for an optical device (the first camera), leading to the making of the first known photographs, i.e., The Lost Tarot, how in 1994 the deck was discovered buried in a Nottingham farmer’s field, and how the use of digital tools allowed for its restoration.

Here's an image of the original Testamentum:

William Bradford's Testamentum, signed 1555, offered as a 13"" x 19"" print with the ""In the Year 1555"" perk — also available for purchase as a single add-on
 
Here is the text for William Bradford's Testamentum in its entirety:
THE LOST TAROT
A CHRONICLE OF THE CURIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES RELATING TO ITS ORIGINS AND PARTICULARS
From the Journals of the Wool Merchant William Bradford
(b. Feb 28, 1488—d. Dec 13, 1555) Nottingham, England
Testamentum: William Bradford
Let it be known:
So it was that under the wise legislation of Henry the Seventh, a commercial treaty having been struck with the Florentine Republic, under which English merchants undertook to carry every year to Florence sufficient wool to supply all the Italian city states, saving Venice, in the Year of Our Lord 1504, I traveled to Florence for the purpose of delivering much desired Nottingham wool to receive the proper purple dye, in which the Italians much exceeded our English ability.
It was there as a young apprentice to an English trader that I chanced to encounter the esteemed Florentine, Leonardo da Vinci, a polymath of extraordinary vision; painter, sculptor, architect, and anatomist, prone to uncanny technological design and invention; wings for flying, a mechanical knight, a steam cannon, and shoes for walking on water.

Of particular interest to myself, the genius da Vinci envisioned an optical device, a camera obscura, for the capture of sun pictures; a boxlike contraption of wood, and a lens of ground glass, the pictures themselves formed through the application of chemicals on coated glass, the principal being first noted by the Greek philosopher and scientist Aristotle; how light passing through a small hole into a darkened room produces an image on the opposite wall.

My master, who held me in some favor, and knew of my desire, purchased for me several of da Vinci’s drawings, the most intriguing being a design for the creation of sun pictures. Having returned to England, I became obsessed with da Vinci’s novelty, and how it might be brought to practical use. To this end, having become a polished gentleman of some considerable means, I employed various tradesmen to fashion different parts of the apparatus: the blacksmith Ulric Baynard for the construction of mechanical parts, Drogo Karolus, a grinder of finely crafted lenses, and Hugh Gaillard, the apothecary, for chemicals and imaging glass, until at last—Eureka!
Beyond the blush of first astonishment, which cannot here be overstated, being a soul of largely pragmatic considerations, myself possessing no skill as a draftsman or painter, but being an appreciator of the arts, I set my mind to how the device might be used in the service of creating a personal vision beyond that of still life, portraiture, and landscape.
Thereafter, I several times set sail for the boot in the sea, and upon occasion bought more drawings. It was during one such trip that I first encountered a new form of entertainment; a game of heavily colored playing cards the Italians called trionfi, or triumphs.

These I acquired by barter for my own amusement, in exchange for Nottingham wool. Upon further study, I understood the game to be a disguise for a powerful set of esoteric images forming a system of divination. From that point, I became consumed by deciphering the cards, and determined to make images for my own tarot.
Working in secrecy, certain that servants of the inquisition at the profane direction of certain members of the Holy Church would view the endeavor as the work of the devil—divination being a pastime of the King of Hell, punishable by torture and death—I enjoined family and trusted members of the good folk of Nottingham to sit for me, and so, the Great Work began.
Well set upon my task, following in the manner of the Italian Tarot in the use of code and symbol, I further sought the aid of the Flemish painter, Franz van Eyck, for the creation, where necessary, of fauna, floral, and varied adornment applied directly to the glass plates.
After eleven years of trial and considerable error, the undertaking was brought to completion.
It was shortly after the completion of the Nottingham Tarot that I learned of the death of the virtuoso, da Vinci, the great man’s spirit having flown, God rest his soul, Amen, in 1519, in France, where he spent his last days, while under the sponsorship of the French monarch, Francis I, although the news did not reach me until many months after the event. Having no wish to lay claim to the remarkable invention without giving due credit to the master, it was my fondest wish that I return to Italy and demonstrate its use, but it was not to be.
During the great epidemic of the sweating sickness in 1528, I hid the opus, leaving instruction with my eldest, Merek, and with my solicitor, in the event of my death. They, however, God rest their souls, preceded me in their ascent to Holy Heaven.
Having several times been visited by member of the clergy, who wished to know about the strange device, I pled innocence and claimed no knowledge of it, attributing the rumor of its existence to a rival businessman who wished to cause me grief and usurp my share of trade.
Now, myself gravely ill and approaching imminent death, in the spirit of the enigmatic undertaking that has consumed me these two and fifty years, I make my final entry: regarding the fruit of my labor and blessed vision born under the direction of the Mage da Vinci, and wishing dearly that it not be lost forever, the treasure trove lies buried somewhere in Dear England. May they who discovers its whereabouts do with it as they will.
By me—William Bradford.

What is a Testamentum?
A Testamentum is simply an Old English word borrowing from the Latin for testament, a legal term meaning to “testify” or “witness.”
Is William Bradford’s Testamentum real?
No, the Testamentum is a fiction, a ""game of pretense"" created for the purpose of supplementing The Lost Tarot in an attractive fictional way.
Do the cards in the original 2017 Major Arcana differ from those in The Lost Tarot 202178-Card Edition?
For The Lost Tarot 78-Card Edition, seven cards in the Majors have been changed from the original, and several more have been slightly altered. As such, we view each Lost Tarot as a separate, stand alone project.

One of the new Major cards for the 78-Card Edition of The Lost Tarot

""I know nothing about Hans Bauer, but just from handling this deck, I can tell you his brain works in impressive, wondrous ways. There is an astuteness to his creativity, and an exacting method to his stream of imagination."" — Benebell Wen, author of Holistic Tarot (2015) and The Tao of Craft (2016) — benebellwen.com ""The Sgt. Pepper of tarot decks."" — Anonymous ""I’ve been collecting Tarot decks for about thirty years – I’ve probably given away more sets of Tarot cards than most people own in a lifetime – and every once in a while I run across one that really makes me stop and say, “Wow. This is COOL.” Hans Bauer’s Lost Tarot is one of those decks. The Lost Tarot is definitely what I’d consider an “art deck.” It would look great as a collectible or conversation piece because Hans Bauer has crafted some incredibly lovely imagery with a unique style… but it’s so much more than that. It’s also highly readable, which for me is the litmus test of whether or not I will use a deck more than once. It’s a beautiful deck, feels good in your hands, and the imagery is inviting and stylish. I totally give The Lost Tarot 9/10 broomsticks!"" — Patti Wigington, author of That Falconer Woman — pattiwigington.com

The 2017 Lost Tarot Major Arcana Limited Edition, offered with the ""Two of Cups"" perk and ""A Perfect World"" perk.
 
""I would recommend this deck if you are really into world creation, the medieval period, renaissance fairs, and falling into the fictitious myth surrounding the deck's creation."" — Ariel, Certified Psychic Medium, Tarot Reader, Reiki Master Teacher (RMT), and Certified Crystal Healer (CCH) — mavenunmasked.com ""Oh, I am so in love! The deck is a gem, and the brains behind it a sensitive soul and true gentleman! Thank you so much, Mr. Bauer, I feel very proud and happy to have this little gem of a Tarot."" — Andrea Marques, Etsy buyer ""Outstanding. Just beautiful! The art work is just breathtaking. Wonderful eye for the details. Looking forward to the rest of the deck."" — Keith Taylor, Etsy buyer

""There are hundreds of different Tarot decks from which to choose, each with its own energy, mythology, symbolism and artwork. But few can compare to the lush beauty of The Lost Tarot, a collection created by photo-based artist Hans Bauer. Each card in the deck is a masterful work of art — full-color lush and poetic imagery that draws from the energy that is its creator. Art aficionados who are familiar with Bauer’s work —always dreamlike and lyrical with a soupçon of the mystic — will be suitably impressed with his latest project, which is gallery worthy by any standard. Even those who place no stock in the Tarot is a tool of divination will appreciate the sheer beauty of this deck. But for those who are believers, The Lost Tarot is a breathtakingly beautiful conduit to lift the veil and unlock the sixth sense."" — Donna Gable Hatch, a writer-editor-collage artist, Outer Banks, North Carolina ""As a professor of mythology and creative writing who reads and collects the Tarot, I am always excited to see the arrival of a new deck. With The Lost Tarot, photo-based artist, Hans Bauer, creates a dazzling palette of medieval imagery, while preserving the universal symbols of each card, enriching both my personal and academic life."" — Kathleen Ann Hudson, Phd, Schreiner University

Impact and Environmental commitments
Reusability and recyclability
All paper-waste produced at our printer's facility in Florida is provided to a paper recycling company; they do not throw any of it away.  Carton stocks used for our tuck box packaging are recyclable.
Sustainable materials
Our printer's facility in Florida uses toner rather than ink, which makes it an eco-friendlier option.  Additionally our Lost Tarot cards will not use plastic coating. The coating is water-based.
Environmentally friendly factories
Our Florida Printer's products are environmentally safety-certifiable, meaning our tarot cards will pass the standard testing that is sometimes required by different companies to provide the product as an eco-friendly item. (Please note, the actual certification is on a final-product basis so we cannot say that it is already certified. We would need to have testing done on the finished decks.)
 
∞

Risks & Challenges
The Lost Tarot 78-Card Edition is now complete and ready to be printed, the custom-made tuck boxes ready to be manufactured. Test printings for the cards have already been carried out and a printer decided upon, so there should be no issues or challenges in the manufacturing of the decks.
As we do not have a final sample on hand, please note that the style of the tuck box and Companion Guide may slightly vary from the mockups presented in the campaign.
For the production of all perks and add-ons, sufficient time has been left until the shipping date of February 22, 2022, so here too deadlines should not be missed. If any issues arise, they will be made public in our campaign updates and adjustments made to the dates of delivery.
We hope you will help us make this Lost Tarot campaign a success!

<h3> Short Summary</h3>
<p style=""background-color: transparent;"">My name is Roy, I am an Illustrator and old school wrestling fan from the UK and I invite you to join me in the World of Wrestling in all its grandiose and splendour. During the journey, you'll meet many of the Heels and Faces, beloved in American wrestling.</p>
<p style=""background-color: transparent;"">The inspiration for this deck comes from my fondness for Pamela Colman-Smiths art, fascination of Esoteric Art and American Wrestling. Being from the UK and of a certain age, Saturdays afternoons were all about the World of Sport Wrestling and the athletic theatrics that ensued!</p>
<p>Moving into my teens, you would occasionally find a 1hr slot of Wrestling during late Saturday nights, usually during the School Summer Holidays. From there it progressed into buying VHS tapes, getting into the tape trading scene before finally getting satellite TV in the mid 90s (Yay!)</p>
<p style=""background-color: transparent;"">This deck will feature 78 illustrated cards of the Major and Minor Arcana. My Inspiration comes from the Rider-Waite-Smith Tarot deck. By using Pamela Colman-Smith’s art as my model, I can combine the semiotics of the Tarot with the grandiloquence and Fairy tale appeal of American wrestling. My art stays faithful to Pamela Coleman-smith’s style and colouring aesthetic creating a fusion of contemporary and modern practices. </p>

<p>This campaign is to fund the first wave of a children's book called THE ATOPOTS. The story is about a group of benevolent beings that embody the spirit of many different facets of life, bringing magic and wonder to the eyes and ears of its readers.  Each Atopot bring forth their own set of special skills and invite the Reader to use their imagination &amp; creativity to bring these beautiful beings to life.</p>
<p>The goal for this project is to raise enough funds to cover the cost of getting 500 hardcover books printed with quality inks that are safe for all the readers, especially the children. The book is already formatted and ready for print....All it needs is some financial support to make it happen. I plan to order the books at the end of the campaign in October, if all goes well. From there it will take 6-8 weeks to receive the first shipment of books! Anyone who donates $25 or more will receive a copy of the book (estimated by December) so make sure to select the perk! </p>
<p>I was inspired to create this book once I found out I was pregnant with my son, Rhythm. He was the source of pure bliss that I needed in order to begin the creative process of putting together what is now, this story.  I had wanted to create a children’s book for quite some time, and now I had the best reason to.  It became my pregnancy project that lasted well past the 9 months it takes to grow a baby.  I began creating the images with acrylic paint on canvas.  When I painted the first image, I did not know at the time that it would be the start of this project.  I was inspired to create a Mamma and her baby.  Humorously,  My husband had told me that it looked like they were potato people.  I agreed, so then got inspired to create more of them, which led to enough images for a story and a better name....the Atopots (Which is the word potato rearranged.)  The Atopots had a ring to it and was destined to become what it is today.  Once I had all the images, I asked my husband to help write the story with his beautiful way of blending words.  I was so happy to once again be creating together.  I listened as the story unfolded and got excited to move on to the final stages of development.  It took some time, as my focus turned into Mothering our beautiful son, but it came together in perfect time, for his almost 1st year birthday! </p>
<p>My prayer is for the story of the Atopots to be in the hands of many parents and children and to inspire and uplift them in this challenging time. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Risks and challenges: </p>
<p>Some of the potential risks and challenges of this project include not being able to sell as many books as I Intend to, making sure it is completely ready for print and making sure all the design aspects are correct, allowing enough time to raise the necessary funds, and reaching its target audience.</p>

<p><strong><i>1. Greek earth goddess: 2. Hypothesis: Living and non-living components of earth function as a single system.</i></strong></p>
<p>The latest sculpture by Marco Cochrane with Julia Whitelaw, GAIA is inspired by and in honor of nurturing energy...mothering energy...love and connection: and the joy we feel when we act on the imperative to take care of each other and our planet.</p>
<h3>But First... a Brief Recap: The Bliss Project...Burning Man 2020...Renegade 2021 and Everything In Between.</h3>
<p>After The Bliss Project...</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1620267153/irnsvmoydzykjv0cev68.jpg"" src=""""/> </p>
<p>Well... we were tired  ; ) So we took a few years off...</p>
<p>Then, in December 2018 inspiration struck Julia and GAIA was born. We started with a life-size clay sculpture, completed the 15-foot clay and had plans to bring GAIA to Burning Man 2020 at 40 feet x 12 feet, constructed of stainless steel rod based on a “flower of life” pattern (54,000 welded connections) and covered in stainless steel mesh with LED lighting effects. In front of her, a circular deck, at its center, a fire pit.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1620267530/tzxfs3cuaztupcq2dzou.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Marco designed a new build system that would enable hundreds of volunteers to help build her as a community. We had the 40-foot long wooden armature built and fully occupying our studio and were perfecting the metal placement system/volunteer training guidelines when COVID-19 arrived. Suddenly, everything changed. The world stopped. The build, of course...stopped. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1620267905/mvrte9cpyhutd7weykgq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>When shelter- in- place laws lifted, we implemented COVID-19 protocols and got back to work, with a few people at a time. We made progress and now, as the world is opening up, so are we. While it may not be the hundreds of people we envisioned, we have been able to welcome new crew over the past few months and we are thrilled with the results!</p>

<p>When it seemed as if Burning Man 2021 might happen we considered our options. What if there is Burning Man... What if there is no Burning Man...To go or not to go? ...It was a dilemma. We read compelling statements of intent from various theme camps and had many conversations with friends.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Marco's sculptures...collaborations with his models...are manifestations of emotional expression...art as a way to put missing energy in the world...art as a catalyst to social change... to inspire action. Ultimately, our decision was guided our belief that right now, the world needs GAIA energy. We need to take care of each other and our planet. We are one family. We need to focus on policies and practices that support and enhance this reality. That was true before COVID-19 and it is even more apparent now. </p>
<p>For this reason,  we applied for a permit from the Bureau of Land Management to bring her to the playa the week of August 29-September 6, 2021. Unfortunately, we recently learned there will be no permits issued this year.  We are currently determining whether there is still some way to bring her to the playa, or elsewhere, in 2021.  Of course we also plan to bring her to TTID in 2022!  Either way, now is the time to finish her and we need your help!</p>
<h3>GAIA'S FORM</h3>
<p>Julia’s vision for GAIA was inspired by the joy she and her children experienced those times when, as a young mother, she took them to the beach and watched as they ran, jumped, dug, built castles, buried each other in the sand, made new friends and by her own memories of being that child. The bliss of creating and enjoying a supportive, connected and nurturing home base from which to launch ourselves and explore our strengths. A reminder of the symbiotic nature of our relationships with each other and with Mother Nature.</p>
<p>On the playa, GAIA is that place we are always looking for; a gathering space with good energy - a center to return to where we will likely run into people we know who are drawn there too...</p>
<h2>Marco’s Musing on GAIA</h2>
<p>There is an energy that has been expressing life for billions of years in an endless variety; an unbroken chain.</p>
<p>For mammals, the female, the mother, creates a continuous physical and emotional connection between the generations, born through the body, and then a caring and giving of energy and time to nurture each life.</p>
<p>Mothers... aware, connected, teaching, pushing, feeding, knowing.</p>
<p>This is the energy of GAIA.</p>
<p>An energy all life depends on; something so powerful, it’s scary.</p>
<p>Especially if you are a man, because you come from it but you are not it. And therein lies the problem. We live in a world dominated by men who fear the power of women. Not all men, but that is the prevailing energy.</p>
<p>Most human systems - cultural, religious, economic - have been specifically designed to dominate and control women. Think about it. The very thing we all depend on is devalued and suppressed at every turn. </p>
<p>And the truth is, this energy, life, our planet as powerful as it is, is also fragile. It’s time to support the heroism of nurturers; to listen to the voices with a nurturing focus and tell that part of the human story. </p>
<p>Our hope is that GAIA will inspire action in support of those policies that recognize we need to take care of each other and our planet....a thriving wage, universal healthcare, childcare, a green new deal...</p>
</div><div>
<h3>WHAT'S DONE?</h3>

<h3>WHAT'S NEXT?</h3>
<p>What's left you ask? We still have a lot of work to do before she is playa ready! It will be a challenge, but it's nothing we haven't done before! </p>
<p>1. Complete the interior welding.</p>
<p>2. Electropolish each weld point.</p>
<p>3. Create and attach the hair.</p>
<p>4. Design and build the deck.</p>
<p>5. Design and build the firepit.</p>
<p>5. Marco will build the toes and hand using the pantograph (the enlargement tool from the 1600s used to build the sculptures of the Bliss Project).</p>
<p>6. Mesh placement on the exterior.</p>
<p>7. Test and prepare lighting system and design the lighting program.</p>
<p>Funds raised will go towards remaining materials, studio costs (which doubled due to COVID), transportation, engineering, insurance, and support of the installation crew on playa. Given there will be no Burning Man this year we will need funds to cover the costs of heavy equipment and other on playa conveniences previously provided by the org.</p>
<h3>How Can You Help?</h3>
<p>There are two ways you can help:</p>
<p>First - we need funds to support the build! We have raised 3/4 of the funds called for in our initial budget, and we need to raise at least the other quarter - not to mention our costs have significantly increased due to studio costs for the longer build. Specifically, our minimum budget funding gap is $50,000. (To cover all of the additional costs we have actually incurred to build GAIA due to COVID-related increases, we would need to raise an additional $146,000.) We have launched this Indiegogo page to help us close the gap and have great perks to offer as a show of our appreciation for your support. Please check them out and consider donating! We are fiscally sponsored, so donations are tax deductible to the extent allowed by law.</p>
<p>Second - you can actively participate in supporting the nurturers in your life and advocating for policies/laws that amplify nurturing energy. If you have any thoughts on how to further expand on this concept, or you have an idea that you think will align with GAIA, please contact us. We’d love to hear from you!</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>For 2021, the risks and challenges are that things will change and safety concerns due to COVID-19 will impact our plans. There is also a chance that we will not be able to bring her to the playa in 2021 due to the Bureau of Land Management’s rules for 2021.  Either way, our plan is to bring GAIA to Burning Man in 2022. Our other challenge is raising the necessary funds.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
<p>Art can illuminate the human condition and be a catalyst to social change ...Our hope is to expand human consciousness and inspire men and women to take action to advocate for and take care of each other, our human family, thus allowing all of us to live fully and thrive! We are asking you to stand with us!</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone for the incredible support you have provided in the past, and to everyone who is considering supporting GAIA. There is just no way projects like this could happen without you!</p>

READY? SET? 
GAIA 2021? and 2022!
1. Greek earth goddess: 2. Hypothesis: Living and non-living components of earth function as a single system.
The latest sculpture by Marco Cochrane with Julia Whitelaw, GAIA is inspired by and in honor of nurturing energy...mothering energy...love and connection: and the joy we feel when we act on the imperative to take care of each other and our planet.
But First... a Brief Recap: The Bliss Project...Burning Man 2020...Renegade 2021 and Everything In Between.
After The Bliss Project...
 
Well... we were tired  ; ) So we took a few years off...
Then, in December 2018 inspiration struck Julia and GAIA was born. We started with a life-size clay sculpture, completed the 15-foot clay and had plans to bring GAIA to Burning Man 2020 at 40 feet x 12 feet, constructed of stainless steel rod based on a “flower of life” pattern (54,000 welded connections) and covered in stainless steel mesh with LED lighting effects. In front of her, a circular deck, at its center, a fire pit.

Marco designed a new build system that would enable hundreds of volunteers to help build her as a community. We had the 40-foot long wooden armature built and fully occupying our studio and were perfecting the metal placement system/volunteer training guidelines when COVID-19 arrived. Suddenly, everything changed. The world stopped. The build, of course...stopped. 



When shelter- in- place laws lifted, we implemented COVID-19 protocols and got back to work, with a few people at a time. We made progress and now, as the world is opening up, so are we. While it may not be the hundreds of people we envisioned, we have been able to welcome new crew over the past few months and we are thrilled with the results!


When it seemed as if Burning Man 2021 might happen we considered our options. What if there is Burning Man... What if there is no Burning Man...To go or not to go? ...It was a dilemma. We read compelling statements of intent from various theme camps and had many conversations with friends.
Ultimately, Marco's sculptures...collaborations with his models...are manifestations of emotional expression...art as a way to put missing energy in the world...art as a catalyst to social change... to inspire action. Ultimately, our decision was guided our belief that right now, the world needs GAIA energy. We need to take care of each other and our planet. We are one family. We need to focus on policies and practices that support and enhance this reality. That was true before COVID-19 and it is even more apparent now. 
For this reason,  we applied for a permit from the Bureau of Land Management to bring her to the playa the week of August 29-September 6, 2021. Unfortunately, we recently learned there will be no permits issued this year.  We are currently determining whether there is still some way to bring her to the playa, or elsewhere, in 2021.  Of course we also plan to bring her to TTID in 2022!  Either way, now is the time to finish her and we need your help!
GAIA'S FORM
Julia’s vision for GAIA was inspired by the joy she and her children experienced those times when, as a young mother, she took them to the beach and watched as they ran, jumped, dug, built castles, buried each other in the sand, made new friends and by her own memories of being that child. The bliss of creating and enjoying a supportive, connected and nurturing home base from which to launch ourselves and explore our strengths. A reminder of the symbiotic nature of our relationships with each other and with Mother Nature.
On the playa, GAIA is that place we are always looking for; a gathering space with good energy - a center to return to where we will likely run into people we know who are drawn there too...
Marco’s Musing on GAIA
There is an energy that has been expressing life for billions of years in an endless variety; an unbroken chain.
For mammals, the female, the mother, creates a continuous physical and emotional connection between the generations, born through the body, and then a caring and giving of energy and time to nurture each life.
Mothers... aware, connected, teaching, pushing, feeding, knowing.
This is the energy of GAIA.
An energy all life depends on; something so powerful, it’s scary.
Especially if you are a man, because you come from it but you are not it. And therein lies the problem. We live in a world dominated by men who fear the power of women. Not all men, but that is the prevailing energy.
Most human systems - cultural, religious, economic - have been specifically designed to dominate and control women. Think about it. The very thing we all depend on is devalued and suppressed at every turn. 
And the truth is, this energy, life, our planet as powerful as it is, is also fragile. It’s time to support the heroism of nurturers; to listen to the voices with a nurturing focus and tell that part of the human story. 
Our hope is that GAIA will inspire action in support of those policies that recognize we need to take care of each other and our planet....a thriving wage, universal healthcare, childcare, a green new deal...

WHAT'S DONE?
When everything shut down in March 2021, we had just completed building the wooden armature and had begun metal placement. We were still refining the system with crew leads Katy Boynton (Big Red), Al Stahler and Scott Ashkenaz (Smash): how to measure, cut, place and temporarily secure the metal to the armature, figuring out how best to train volunteers...and everything suddenly stopped. For a few months, no one came to the studio, except Marco who began building the face. Then, slowly, at the end of May, with the organizational support of Jenni Nelson, we started inviting crew back to the studio, a few people at a time, following strict protocols. By February 2021 we had completed the metal placement and exterior welding and grinding began. By the end of March 2021, we started to pull the wooden armature out and tackle the interior welding.

Far from being a collage, these botanical masterpieces were beautifully reproduced using a drawing technique called stippling. In its purest form, a stippled image is composed exclusively of dots. One must look at it at a precise distance to genuinely appreciate its richness. As such, stippling became the common thread weaving together all the art in La Flora Tarot.<br/> </p><div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/k-1zNYVVGGU?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><div> </div><div style=""text-align: center;"">

Since the curated drawings come from different eras, locations and artists, they lack stylistic cohesion. Stippling served as a unifying tool, establishing a common ground and weaving all pieces together. I also felt a deep sense of poetic justice, as each dot resembled tiny seeds, which, if victorious, would mature into a majestic plant! Then, there is stippling's inherit condition, as it resonates with me: Many a time, when too close to a subject matter, we cannot see clearly and must distance ourselves to make sense of it, but we cannot remain forever detached; we must reengage and act, promoting proximity yet again. This is what Stippling means to me, finding the best balance, the best perspective to appreciate art or life itself.</p><div style=""text-align: center;"">

Last, but most definitely not least, the name La Flora is an homage to the Roman Goddess of Spring and Flowers.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619925540/vqhxf8wfg8crqcipvekh.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Of all the steps required to create La Flora Tarot, none was more important or impactful than marrying plants and Tarot. I could try to describe how each card found its counterpart but that would be the guidebook in itself. Instead, I will present a simple case study on how Datura Metel came to represent The Devil.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619925888/dwfkgq8midtjrajgwtxt.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The first step was to understand the plant’s characteristics to form a profile which could be used to match it to a Tarot card. In the case of the Datura Metel, its popular name, Devil’s Trumpet, is a clear indication of a potential best match. Even so, further investigation was required.</p><p><strong>The Plant</strong> - Part of the Nightshade family, Datura is a plant known for its narcotic and hallucinogenic powers. Scopolamine and hyoscyamine, some extremely hazardous neurotoxins, are derived from Datura. Scopolamine is a tasteless and odorless mind-altering substance, fatal at high doses, but most notoriously known for producing loss of memory and hallucinations. Scopolamine acts by blocking neurotransmitters that carry information to the part of the brain responsible for storing short-term memory. Whatever happens to people under the effect of Scopolamine is simply not registered by the brain. One can easily imagine how terribly malicious the use of such substance could be, especially if the subject is unaware of it. Maybe diabolical would be the proper word to describe it.</p><p><strong>The Tarot</strong> - The Devil might very well be the most dangerously powerful card in Tarot. It speaks of shadows we do not want to face, but must. The traditional interpretation of The Devil depicts it as a force of illusion and oppression. “The Devil’s power exists in the illusion that nothing else exists” - <i>Rachel Pollack</i>. Living in the dark hidden areas of the self, The Devil is powerful, controlling and persuasive while playing as a high skilled puppet master whom is hard to resist.</p><p><strong>The Match</strong> - Again, <i>sola dosis facit venenum</i>. The Swiss alchemist Paracelsus is remembered for recognizing that the distinction between medicine and poison is a matter of dose. You might have encountered Scopolamine before since it is most used in transdermal plasters to treat travel sickness. So there are benefits to its use, whereas its abuse is something we are not even willing to contemplate. Illusion, materialism, misery: Are you The Devil or maybe its puppet? One must break his or her acquiescence or even willingness to live an illusion for the sake of being seemingly comfortable with the status quo to, instead, face the hard questions which must be asked and absorb the brutally honest answers required for change. The key to set oneself free from the Devil is, first and foremost, to acknowledge his existence.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619926058/fkhlmk73ov4h8ypgczf0.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>I have always had great interest in the back of Tarot cards.

In a sense, Jung claimed that our behavior is not a simple matter of reflexes and habits, but rather that each of us lives a myth in which archetypal characters, themes and settings play a role.</p><p>Altogether, I felt overwhelmingly compelled to see the four-leaf clover as the quintessential symbol of the La Flora Tarot, thus adorning many of the complementary items such as the wooden pieces, the reading cloth, pin and, especially, the Lucky Coin as, above all, it has the potential to become an instrument of synchronicity.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619926401/uwjdzqu2jo2smjyuwh3d.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>We are living through strange and difficult times.

I am Iara Côrtes, illustrator, graphic designer and founder of the design studio laluli. I am thrilled that you are here to check out my project, so without further ado...La Flora TarotLa Flora Tarot is a botanical tarot deck based on the Rider Waite Smith system. It goes far beyond the aesthetics of plant drawings. La Flora Tarot is a true study on the correlation of plants and all the Tarot archetypes in a deep, meaningful way. More, much more, on this later!Stylistically, La Flora is based on a highly curated selection of centuries old drawing masterpieces originally created for scientific purposes but pushing the edge on the realm of pure art. Far from being a collage, these botanical masterpieces were beautifully reproduced using a drawing technique called stippling. In its purest form, a stippled image is composed exclusively of dots. One must look at it at a precise distance to genuinely appreciate its richness. As such, stippling became the common thread weaving together all the art in La Flora Tarot.  
Stippling, the art of drawing with dots only La Flora Tarot goes beyond the deck. It is my humble yet firm belief that such a deep study and elegant rendition deserves to be experienced in more ways than one. Armed with this resolve, I set out to create a line of complementary items which would normally be expected from commended Tarot decks, such as a naturally hand dyed reading cloth, pin and a beautifully crafted tuck box. But that alone would just not do it! To truly experience La Flora Tarot and all the revelations about to unfold, the querent needed more. Ergo, the LFX – La Flora eXperience.LFX - La Flora eXperience: prototypeLa Flora Experience is an exclusive set bringing absolutely everything one could possibly dream of for an unprecedented Tarot session. From a tabletop Zen garden complete with black sand and rakes, to a bespoke oil blend, crystals and candle, the LFX has got you covered. To make this happen, I designed from scratch a set of wooden pieces, all modular in function, to contain all items, reveal their shape and assist with the entire reading session. Designing LFX was a great experience, as I had to cater for function as well as form. I was lucky to find some very talented people to collaborate with, in woodworking, fabric, metal and oil.Designing the La Flora eXperienceStemming from LFX, a few items such as the card holders and the wooden deck box  made their way into some of the reward tiers and add-on options. The idea being  to make some of the incredible LFX items available for the largest possible crowd to enjoy.Then there is the whole research involving the La Flora symbol: the Four-Leaf Clover and its meaning... but enough “talking”. As it is commonly said, a picture speaks a thousand words, so here is a deluge of verbiage for your viewing pleasure. Still, I invite you to read along and dive deeper into the inspiration, concept and processes involved in the creation of La Flora Tarot. I am humbled by your attention and hopeful to have you as part of La Flora Tarot’s story.Major ArcanaSuit Of WandsSuit of PentaclesSuit of CupsSuit of SwordsThe deck will be composed of 84 cards measuring 75 mm x 130 mm, printed in high quality, heavy linen stock, matte finished playing card medium. The 6 additional cards will be as follows:A PDF Guidebook covering the ins and outs of plants and Tarot matching will be made available for download to all backers.I must confess that despite some very intricate and elaborate deck boxes available in the market these days, I decided to stick with the traditional tuck box. The reason is two-fold: first, I personally love the classic, simplistic look of a tuck box, which bodes well with the minimalist approach taken in the whole project; second, if a no-holds barred box is what you are looking for, I have just that, the Wooden Box, available in specific tiers or as an add-on. The tuck box will be cellophane wrapped and feature a custom seal. Embossing is something I am toying with to help bring out the design a bit more.La Flora Tarot Tuck Box - work in progressLooking back to the beginnings of La Flora Tarot, I now realize how pivotal the essay “The Intelligence of the Flowers” by Maurice Maeterlinck was to me. One can never unlearn the brutality and beauty of the plant world and it is exactly the balance found in this dichotomy that creates the harmony we see from the outside. The author uses prose to describe scientific knowledge. “Writing with eloquence, Maeterlinck asserts that flowers possess the power of thought without knowledge, a capacity that constitutes a form of intelligence” - Unknown.News of Spring, a collection of essays by Maurice Maeterlinck where I found ""The Intelligence of The Flowers"" & Still Life by Elias Van Den Broeck 1670-1708As for myself, being a Brazilian and a Canadian, I had the chance to experience nature in two vastly different ways and that, in itself, was an eye opener. It truly helped shape my mind as to what the plant world really is all about and La Flora Tarot reflects this view.Besides the fascinating struggle hidden behind each plant’s existence, I feel deeply touched by the beauty of botanical drawings and privileged (and slightly overwhelmed) by the sheer amount I managed to curate for La Flora.The pillar of La Flora Tarot is the establishment of a meaningful and purposeful correlation between plants and each of the 78 cards of the Tarot. To achieve this goal, a long and thorough research delving into the botanical realm was required. The detailed analyses of hundreds of species in their minutia allowed  for the election, in the plant kingdom, of the perfect counterparts to each Tarot archetype. This task was enlightening to me and helped build up knowledge to formulate the vision of what I wanted La Flora Tarot to be. Some of the matches came naturally, even conspicuous, whereas others took considerably longer as they became a struggle between candidates and their qualities. In the end, plants and Tarot married in what I believe to be the closest possible concept of perfect harmony. The choice of stippling serves both, a purpose and an intention. Since the curated drawings come from different eras, locations and artists, they lack stylistic cohesion. Stippling served as a unifying tool, establishing a common ground and weaving all pieces together. I also felt a deep sense of poetic justice, as each dot resembled tiny seeds, which, if victorious, would mature into a majestic plant! Then, there is stippling's inherit condition, as it resonates with me: Many a time, when too close to a subject matter, we cannot see clearly and must distance ourselves to make sense of it, but we cannot remain forever detached; we must reengage and act, promoting proximity yet again. This is what Stippling means to me, finding the best balance, the best perspective to appreciate art or life itself.
 Even if less obvious, all design choices have a specific meaning. The colors, black on ecru, are a celebration of the eclectic and marvelous botanical drawings collected throughout History. The choice of style for the back of the cards comes from the Victorians, who left us an immense treasure trove of botanical drawings and their extravagantly adorned book covers. Last, but most definitely not least, the name La Flora is an homage to the Roman Goddess of Spring and Flowers.Of all the steps required to create La Flora Tarot, none was more important or impactful than marrying plants and Tarot. I could try to describe how each card found its counterpart but that would be the guidebook in itself. Instead, I will present a simple case study on how Datura Metel came to represent The Devil.The first step was to understand the plant’s characteristics to form a profile which could be used to match it to a Tarot card. In the case of the Datura Metel, its popular name, Devil’s Trumpet, is a clear indication of a potential best match. Even so, further investigation was required.The Plant - Part of the Nightshade family, Datura is a plant known for its narcotic and hallucinogenic powers. Scopolamine and hyoscyamine, some extremely hazardous neurotoxins, are derived from Datura. Scopolamine is a tasteless and odorless mind-altering substance, fatal at high doses, but most notoriously known for producing loss of memory and hallucinations. Scopolamine acts by blocking neurotransmitters that carry information to the part of the brain responsible for storing short-term memory. Whatever happens to people under the effect of Scopolamine is simply not registered by the brain. One can easily imagine how terribly malicious the use of such substance could be, especially if the subject is unaware of it. Maybe diabolical would be the proper word to describe it.The Tarot - The Devil might very well be the most dangerously powerful card in Tarot. It speaks of shadows we do not want to face, but must. The traditional interpretation of The Devil depicts it as a force of illusion and oppression. “The Devil’s power exists in the illusion that nothing else exists” - Rachel Pollack. Living in the dark hidden areas of the self, The Devil is powerful, controlling and persuasive while playing as a high skilled puppet master whom is hard to resist.The Match - Again, sola dosis facit venenum. The Swiss alchemist Paracelsus is remembered for recognizing that the distinction between medicine and poison is a matter of dose. You might have encountered Scopolamine before since it is most used in transdermal plasters to treat travel sickness. So there are benefits to its use, whereas its abuse is something we are not even willing to contemplate. Illusion, materialism, misery: Are you The Devil or maybe its puppet? One must break his or her acquiescence or even willingness to live an illusion for the sake of being seemingly comfortable with the status quo to, instead, face the hard questions which must be asked and absorb the brutally honest answers required for change. The key to set oneself free from the Devil is, first and foremost, to acknowledge his existence.I have always had great interest in the back of Tarot cards. People ask which card you look at first. For me, that would be the back of the cards. We stare at them for so long that they become the tone setter to whatever is about to be revealed on the other side. The way I see it, the back of the cards is paramount.When deciding on what to draw for the back of La Flora’s cards, the question I tried to answer was: in a Botanical Tarot deck, which plant would better represent the feelings of love, hope, faith and wish for good luck permeated in every reading? I am not a superstitious person but the association of four-leaf clovers to good luck is so ingrained in our culture that it is hard to dismiss it. And, as it turns out, each leaf of a four-leaf clover is said to stand for love, hope, faith and luck.My inquiry did not stop there though. I started to question what the idea of luck meant. I then discovered that Carl Jung viewed luck as synchronicity. He described luck as a meaningful coincidence. It is said that Jung held conversations with Einstein about the possible connection between synchronicity and the Theory of Relativity and Quantum Mechanics.Diagram illustrating Carl Jung's concept of synchronicityJung believed that his thoughts about synchronicity proved the existence of the collective unconscious, defined as a species-typical repository of ancestral history and memory accumulated over evolutionary time. Comprising the collective unconscious is an array of archetypes - categories of objects, people and situations that have existed. In a sense, Jung claimed that our behavior is not a simple matter of reflexes and habits, but rather that each of us lives a myth in which archetypal characters, themes and settings play a role.Altogether, I felt overwhelmingly compelled to see the four-leaf clover as the quintessential symbol of the La Flora Tarot, thus adorning many of the complementary items such as the wooden pieces, the reading cloth, pin and, especially, the Lucky Coin as, above all, it has the potential to become an instrument of synchronicity.We are living through strange and difficult times. A pandemic claiming the lives of over 2.5 million people worldwide at the time of this writing, responsible for the spread of fear, anger, suffering and disruption throughout the entire planet. A time when racism, xenophobia and fascism are raising their ugly heads yet again. When Mother Earth shows her discontent and readiness to disregard our species entirely, if we keep pushing her boundaries. We are living through manipulative fake news turning society into puppets and narcissistic social media pretenders. Life has not been easy.Yet, historically, we have never been so peaceful, so healthy, so wealthy and so safe. Technology continues to evolve at an incredible pace and the Arts are conquering new realms and audiences. ""Miracles"" of Science, Medicine and Infrastructure allowed us to reach record longevity. We have never been so connected, and with it comes a myriad of possibilities and opportunities for cooperation. Look no further! Here we are, connected, all over the world by our love of Tarot and plants, through a crowdfunding platform!To me, the first step toward the light is to acknowledge the darkness. To reach enlightenment, we must first realize our ignorance. Only when we understand our faults and flaws, can we strive to improve. It is with this mindset that I decided to include two extra cards to La Flora Tarot: The Black and The Blank.The wooden box for La Flora Tarot is made of quality wood, moisture and pressure treated. The wood type itself may vary based on availability at the time of fabrication but will always be strong, velvety and, as in the prototype, gorgeous!  Wooden Box - Part of the ""Hard Deck"" Tier and also available as an add-onThe box was designed to fit the deck precisely, giving it a snug feel yet easy handling. The mirrored closing cut coupled with magnets makes it structurally sound and rigid to protect your deck for years on end. As the final touch, the box is engraved with La Flora’s four-leaf clover, to make it standout on every occasion.La Flora has partnered with the plant-based, natural hand-dyer Katelyn, owner of byKellas, in Michigan, for the process of achieving the perfect hues, heft, size and fray for our linen reading cloth. Her ritual of dyeing is natural in essence. Clover, osage, pinecones and avocado pits are some of the raw materials she used for La Flora’s highly curated palette of seven distinct shades.Katelyn's natural hand-dyeing process for La Flora Tarot's Reading ClothEach cloth, measuring approximately 65 x 65 cm (≈ 26 x 26 inches), is then manually stamped with La Flora’s signature clover at the center. This process produces unique variations, much like the Japanese wabi-sabi style, where the aesthetics of the “perfectly imperfect” reign.One of the 7 shades for the La Flora Tarot Reading ClothLinen was chosen, as its history goes back to ancient civilizations. The fabric comes from the flax plant (lat. Linum), it is strong and longer-lasting than cotton or wool. And as with all good things, the cloth should reveal itself and have a better feel to it with time and use.If I had to choose a single word to describe the four-leaf clover card holder set, that would have to be playful. Even though I have designed the set of 4 card holders with the clear intention of replicating La Flora’s four-leaf clover when placed against each other, the combinations in which it can be used is only limited by your creativity. Personally, I have been using them for a traditional 3-card reading of the day, with a fourth “intuition” card. This is how: I place the holders in the four-leaf clover position in a way that I can easily see the faces of three cards as I walk around the room. In the morning, I pull 4 cards with a specific intention in mind and reveal only 3 by placing them on the visible holders, leaving the 4th (the intuition card) unrevealed in the holder facing the wall. During the day, I get to see the 3 cards several times and each time I refresh my interpretation or even consider a new perspective on what those cards are trying to say to me. It is quite impressive how many facets we can find in such a trivial reading if we just give it enough time. Then, later in the day, when I feel I have developed a somewhat firm understanding of the 3 cards message, I finally reveal the “intuition” card and try to force my previous interpretation through the light of the this fourth card. I cannot translate into words the significance the intuition card has brought to my reading countless times, giving me that hard-sought for “a-ha” moment!The wooden Four-Leaf Clover Card Holder Set can be purchased through the Standup Deck tier, the Complete Pack tier, as an add-on or in its special incarnation for the La Flora eXperience tierThe Lucky Coin, a constant reminder that you can make it lucky, will measure 44 mm x 44 mm (or 1.75 in x 1.75 in). Thickness should round about 3 mm, giving it a nice, hefty feeling without exaggeration and, as a final touch, edge engraving. The inner plate will be bordered with raised dots, evoking stippling and seeds. La Flora's four-leaf clover signature is the coin's main feature which will hopefully help guide you through day-to-day considerations when sitting down for a reading is not a possibility.One of my most cherished items surrounding the La Flora Tarot is the Art Prints set. The prints come in a pack of 7 including:- Empress - Lovers- Wheel of Fortune - Tower - Star - Moon - Sun4""x 6"" Art Prints - Set of 7 - Available as add-ons or on the Lucky Coin and Complete Pack TiersI am fond of these prints, first and foremost, because I can use them to share a little bit of my passion with others. Whilst it would not make any sense to take cards of the deck to give to friends and family, I am certainly happy that I can send a print as a special gift to those who I know would appreciate it.The Art Prints are versatile and can be used as decorative art prints (obviously!), as postcards, as bookmarks and, like I mentioned above, they make elegant and intimate gifts. The art is printed on 4”x 6” smooth stock with matte finish. LFX, or the La Flora eXperience, is a sensorial set of objects created to elevate the reading ritual with La Flora Tarot to the highest level. The uncompromised richness of the experience imposes a limited and exclusive production run to only 10 backers during the present campaign. LFX - La Flora eXperience: prototypeThe LFX is my way of bringing to you what I believe to be an incredible  and delightful experience to accompany the reading with the La Flora  Tarot. It all starts with the modular box,  a large, sturdy, velvety wooden box which houses all elements for the perfect La Flora Tarot reading experience. If you are anything like me,  you will want to have all the beautiful LFX items on display and ready  for use, especially with a bespoke four-leaf clover medallion at the  front! With this in mind, I made the box cover a reversible design which  will fit snuggly in the underside, helping elevate the box into a small  altar for the La Flora Zen garden display. Oh yes, have I mentioned that there is a Zen garden display with black sand, rakes and four raw tourmaline stones?!Flipping the cover to turn the LFX box into an altar for the Zen garden displayThe LFX comes with two La Flora Tarot decks: one in a beautifully designed wooden tabletop box and the other on a carrying wooden case. Both beautifully adorned with La Flora’s four-leaf clover emblem forged in black metal, differentiating them from the standard La Flora Tarot wooden deck box, whose clover is laser engraved. The tabletop box truly deserves a special display spot as a minimalist art piece which contains even more art, beauty and revelations inside awaiting those who dare to open it. Both the tabletop and the carrying case, follow on the footsteps of the modular box, featuring magnets for that gratifying tactile feeling when closing them.Another item to receive special treatment was the ever so lovely and useful set of four card holders forming the four-leaf clover shape. The LFX version comes with four tourmaline marbles which rest perfectly on the tip of each holder’s carved surface, adding to the already stylish and versatile piece.Besides touch and sight, the only other sense left for me to explore to help create a full experience was smell, and I held absolutely nothing back! On my side, I had the great aromachologist, Lorianne Anderson, from Spirit Element, to create a bespoke oil blend for La Flora Tarot with the explicit intention of achieving calmness and self-confidence. I discussed with her thoroughly about what I was aspiring and simply let her do her magic. The result is a deliciously sensuous and explicitly floral all-natural rose and jasmine oil blend which comes in an elegant and practical black apothecary jar. The soothing feeling and seductive scent will take you to a place of resolute peace, bar none. Also, a beeswax candle, colored black with vegetable dyes, works as an air purifier and emits a light close to the sunlight spectrum and will help set the mood for a holistic reading session.Finally, the La Flora eXperience will include all complementary items available in this campaign, such as the reading cloth, the lucky coin, a set of seven La Flora Tarot art prints and whatever else gets unlocked by the Stretch Goals! The La Flora Oracle will become a reality and that is a fact! The reason behind an Oracle deck is that, sometimes, I feel the Tarot can be a little too open-ended, as the complexity of interpretations and the experience and self-knowledge of reader and querent vary greatly. This gap is nicely filled by Oracle decks and, in this regard, I intentionally tried to make La Flora Oracle as action oriented as possible. Needless to say, the Oracle does not replace the Tarot by any stretch of imagination but makes for a welcome complement.
 The La Flora Oracle does not come from thin air though. While creating La Flora Tarot, I had this moment when I found myself surrounded by newly acquired knowledge of so many plants; their peculiarities, struggles and successes; that suddenly, it became crystal clear how relatable the plants were to my own life story and that of so many people I know, personally or otherwise. The cherry on the top was that I already had such a vast collection of original drawings to work with, that everything fell in place perfectly towards the creation of La Flora Oracle.All the artwork is finished and a prototype is in hand. Initially, I intended to launch both the Tarot and the Oracle in a single campaign but the first grew into a considerably greater project, making it wise to leave the latter for a separate, upcoming campaign. The decision to split the projects came naturally, as not only will I have the chance to get my feet wet with crowdfunding initiatives, but most importantly, the La Flora Oracle, is such an encompassing project, that it truly deserves its own campaign.Tarot and Oracle card backs - Yin YangAll orders will be shipped from the US by Fulfillrite, with the exception of the limited La Flora eXperience, which will be shipped by myself, from Canada.The two most important things I wish to be very clear and upfront about:* shipping will be charged separately in our pledge manager, during the final survey* orders outside of the US might be subject to import fees/taxes at the Backer's expense   Risks and challengesIn these troubling times of COVID-19, a significant risk is, undoubtedly, the potential for delays in manufacturing and distribution. As of the time of this writing, I am being generous with shipping date estimates, allotting extra time based on current worldwide circumstances which, dynamic as they are, could improve or worsen without notice. I will thus react accordingly, applying any necessary adjustments and always making sure to communicate them promptly and honestly with all backers.Having said that, we, as a collective global society, cannot blame everything on the pandemic for we do not live (and never have) in a perfect world. Whenever an idea is to be materialized into serial production for worldwide shipping, especially if using remote resources, mistakes which could cause delays and dissatisfaction might happen. Again, any vagaries in production and distribution will be dealt with openly and methodically.To minimize risks and challenges, I am partnering exclusively with ethical and experienced companies and individuals. Most notably, the deck will be manufactured by Expert Playing Card Company, EPCC, a printer focused on quality and innovation, widely recognized for extraordinary decks made available on Kickstarter. On the distribution side, I will be working with Fulfillrite, an established 3PL whose reputation for proactiveness and vast experience fulfilling domestic (from the US) and international rewards for Kickstarter and Indiegogo campaigns sets a precedence for success.Finally, I would be remiss if I did not mention that even though this is was my first Kickstarter and subsequent Indiegogo campaign, I do rely on my husband's guidance and expertise earned from operating his small business for the past 11 years, fulfilling over 14,000 custom-made orders shipped to 48 Countries around the world. This means we are no strangers to small scale manufacturing, logistics and customer service and, hopefully, this will help backers feel confident in our capacity to smooth out any unavoidable kinks along the way.",60.0,7,"1 Campaign

My name is Gary Shipman, and I have been making art for more than 30 years working with properties from comics, movies and other. I'm probably best known for my comic book series Titan Mouse of Might and Pakkins' Land. I have been nominated for Eisner, Harvey, and Russ Manning Awards. My work has been published through Disney Publishing, Caliber Press, Image Comics, Cryptozoic, Upper Deck, and Zondervan. I have been exploring different styles of art throughout my life, with no formal art training. I am excited to share this campaign for my 2021 sketchbook entitled Conundrum, This volume collects some of my pieces of art in black & white and full color in an 8.5"" x 11"" large format, 100-page, softbound edition (If we meet our 1st stretch goal it will be made into a hardbound edition).  My expression in art means nothing without all of you to share it with. Your support means more than you know, it helps me to keep doing the art I love. So thank you for all you do. Providing a quality product is the goal. I hope you are as excited about this campaign as I am. I need enough for the printing, distribution, and fees to create this sketchbook. Anything beyond that helps to make other projects possible. The perks are simple, and the prices as low as possible:• $10 DIGITAL: gets you a Digital Download my Conundrum Sketchbook.• $25 SKETCHBOOK: gets you a signed copy of the Conundrum Sketchbook.

Dark and rainy. It’s one of those days that suggest the beauty of film. F-stop wide open, the darkness and grain, the feeling of an impressionist painting. It makes me think of being with someone I love hidden away from the world. There’s a bottle of Merlot we’ve been nursing, and we are creating images together. Clothing optional.</p><p>I don’t know how many days I have had like this in my life; I know the number is not enough. Those kinds of days are mostly remembered at my current age, the possibility of more dwindling rapidly.</p><p>I’ve been really pissed off at the universe lately. My lower back looking like Chernobyl and being unable to roam the city I love, is one reason. I still think like I’m 18, yet my body keeps telling me that I am 65.</p><p>For the most part, I am a realist. This is the situation; let’s deal with it and move on to the next. So, I have agreed with The Black Dog and the Universe to accept my age, my systems breaking down, and the inevitability of the power being turned off.</p><p>I escaped the yoke of organized religion. Though I had been exposed to both the Jewish and Catholic faith when very young. I remember only that these things were not like the others in my life of sleep, eat, toys, and cartoons, and everyone was acting way too seriously.</p><p>I don’t believe in God, and I am a cowardly atheist. I only pray when I am terrified or desperately want something. When my mother got older, she went back to the church after 50 years of being outside. I had no opinion other than it seemed about right for her. I never criticize anyone’s religion, as it has nothing to do with me. In fact, I have great respect for those individuals who have deep unquestioning faith.</p><p>I only have faith in human behavior.</p><p>I have always enjoyed religion’s mythology, though, and I know a fair amount about the more popular ones. I don’t have to believe in a God or any organized religion to apply its philosophy. My favorite being, “What would Jesus do?” He wouldn’t vote for God damn Trump, and I can tell you that.</p><p>Before she died, my mother insisted I learn the Lord’s Prayer just if I was wrong about this whole atheism thing.</p><p>I live alone, and I like it. I like being able to finish a paragraph in a book without having to hide in the bathroom. I watch the TV and movies I want to watch. I also stay up as late as I wish to write or working on my pictures, or tending to my ant colony.</p><p>There are times, however, that I am lonely for the companionship of the opposite sex. I may have always been crap in relationships, but I sure as hell enjoyed the work.</p><p>Recently I asked God to let me fall in love one more time before my expiration date. A little while ago, and seemingly in answer to my plea, I did. The details aren’t essential, but it did seem as if our Lord, be He Hairy Thunderer or Cosmic Muffin*,  is a bit of a joker. I really should have been much more specific with my request.</p><p>Next time it goes like this: “Hello. It’s me. Not scared, but I do want something. Okay? Here goes. Just one more time before I do the dirt nap, I would like to fall in love. Also, I would like the person I fall in love with to love me back. Please, Lord, do not make her bat shit crazy like the last one. Please don’t make her anti-vax, anti-mask, gluten-free, conspiracy-believing, fortune teller going, and rabid Trump supporter. You know, like the last one. Thanks.”</p><p>They say God is in the details.</p><p>So after that short and rather unsettling journey into poor decision-making, I spent a lot of time thinking. Had I, in fact, reached my “best if used by” date? In my funk, I buried myself in the massive job of preparing a new layout for “Women Hold Up Half the Sky,” my new book.</p><p>PLUG: If you haven’t done so, please go to my Indiegogo page and leave your email address. UNPLUG.</p><p>Obviously, in the book, there will be images of women I have been in relationships with. Looking at each image elicits a different response from my head and my gut. One or two make me cringe, and one actually haunts me. It is an image of Linda.</p><p>See, she was in love with me, and I was even engaged to her at one point. At least until she figured out that I was never going to marry her and that I never loved her the way she did me. We parted company and stayed friends for a couple of years but eventually lost touch...</p><p><i>The full story is 1500 words, and you can read it<strong> <a href=""https://www.35mmc.com/06/10/2020/when-you-pray-be-specific-by-gerard-exupery/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. </strong>My other stories and essays can be found <strong><a href=""https://www.35mmc.com/?s=Gerard+exupery"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a></strong>.</i></p><p> </p><p style=""margin-left:200px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1611653796/ftvaqohcwttmxhsetpy0.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Linda<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1611652962/wymfvhk5zpvutozese3i.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">In his introduction to<i>‘SUBWAY New York City 1975-1985’  </i>Mark McQueen said of Exupery:</h3><p><i>""Gerard Exupery is one of those people who always has something to say. He has an uncanny talent for prying poetry out of the most banal of topics, inspiring you to look at them anew.

Worlds where Black queer people are not just living--we're thriving.   The 78 cards are larger than standard Tarot cards to show off the vibrant artwork (3.5"" x 5"" or 89x127mm) and printed on premium heavyweight 350 GSM card stock to make these cards a long lasting collector's item. The BLACK QUEER TAROT is available for pre-order via INDIEGOGO as a full 78-card deck and a hardcover companion guidebook written by Justin Henry that features in-depth descriptions of the artwork, both upright and reversed meanings and three custom spreads making this deck ideal for both beginner and experienced readers.   How Can You Help?I've spent the last few months photographing muses, meticulously creating artwork for the cards, consulting with readers on the symbolism in the deck, all while documenting the process via film. I'm launching an INDIEGOGO campaign to raise the funds necessary to turn this dream into a tangible reality. By powering this project you can grab the BLACK QUEER TAROT deck and companion guidebook and other limited edition merchandise before the release.    Your support will directly fund:
The design, writing and production of the BLACK QUEER TAROT companion guidebook
The production and editing of a short film documenting this entire process 
Fulfillment of all the perks
Additional decks, merchandise and companion books for future online sales
 Do remember, SUPPORT doesn't always have to be financial. Here are some FREE ways to help us achieve our goal:
Help spread the word about the BLACK QUEER TAROT by sharing to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or whichever social media platform you prefer. Every post, retweet, share, like and mention gets us closer to our goal!
Email, text, or call your tarot and astrology enthusiast friends and let them know about the BLACK QUEER TAROT

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Artist</span></h3>
<p><strong><i>Hello! </i></strong> My name is Adi Dahlke, and I am a multimedia artist based out of New York City. I am currently finishing my BFA in Visual and Critical Studies at the School of Visual Arts. Prior to moving here, I studied at the Florence Academy of Art (US branch) and Lyme Academy College of Fine Arts in addition to studying under a number of incredible working artists outside of an academic setting. My artistic practice consists of the following: fine art painting, illustration, drawing, digital collage, printmaking, and poetry. My work is mostly figurative and features a lot of self portraits, subjects which I use to explore themes of queer identity, popular culture, and obsession.</p>
<p>If you'd like to see my work, you can check out my <a href=""http://instagram.com/adidahlke"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram profile</a> or <a href=""http://adidahlke.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">my website</a>. Feel free to also request a portfolio from me via email: adi.dahlke@gmail.com.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>The project you're about to fund is hands-down the most ambitious, urgent, and vivid work of my artistic career to date. One of the most exciting components of this project is the level of engagement that it invites. The project is best experienced with fresh eyes-- that is, with as little prior information as possible-- so that the audience can participate in a process of surprise and discovery.</p>
<p>This puts me in a strange position. The project requires significant financial backing, but due to reasons already described, I cannot give the kind of thorough pitch one would typically expect of a crowd-funded campaign without robbing the project of some of its effectiveness. Thus, I must rely on your trust and generosity in order to see this project to completion. I ask only because I see the potential of this project; I truly believe it will be a significant cultural contribution.</p>
<h3>The Budget</h3>
<p>Of the $15,000 I am raising for this project, about $8,000 is needed to complete the primary product. $1,000 will be used to cover supply costs, and the remaining $6,000 will be used to produce supplementary materials. </p>
<p>If this campaign is funded beyond this goal, all additional funds will be used to create more supplementary materials. In other words: a bigger, better project.</p>
<p>If the goal is not reached, whatever funds are raised will still be put towards the project while I seek additional funding. In the worst-case scenario, I will create a prototype of the project in hopes of seeing the full project to fruition at a later date.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<p>I understand that supporting a project about which you have no information can be difficult. If you're considering contributing more than $1000 to the project, send an email to adi.dahlke@gmail.com for more information.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Help this project reach its goal by sharing this page with family, friends, and followers!</h3>
<p>When this campaign reaches 50% of its funding goal, all backers will be entered into a raffle for one of my oil paintings.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and consideration!</p>

The project was a coffee table, which I finished off with glossy resin. While it wasn’t a masterpiece, my wife was delighted with it. I was pretty proud!However, I didn’t enjoy the experience of working with a chemical resin in my home. So, I got together a team of experts from Reschimica (the chemical company I founded) and challenged them to create a new resin - one that would be fast-setting, safe and usable anywhere.Now, we finally have the result of two years of research and hard work. Liquid Glass Resin. It’s the ideal resin for art lovers and DIY fanatics - just like you. Social Media Risks And Challenges I am Marco - the DIY nut and art lover behind Liquid Glass Resin (LGR).LGR is the project of my life. I have never invented anything before I came up with this revolutionary resin. With a curing time of six hours, this safe, glossy resin represents a real innovation in the epoxy resin market.It’s not been easy creating this new resin. I could not have done it without my team of talented young chemists who stopped at nothing to solve complex problems.The last 12 months saw us take a lot of risks and experience unbelievable failures, but we never gave up. We learned from our mistakes and kept moving forward.We developed LGR in partnership with Reschimica.com - the Italian chemical company. They let us use their labs, chemistry teams and industrial equipment to bring LGR to life. Thanks to this partnership, we are able to deliver LGR to customers on schedule.Bringing new products to market is never easy. It’s possible for unexpected delays to arise due to things such as manufacturing errors, holidays and shipping problems. If that happens we’ll be sure to keep you posted. Our support team of 10 fellow crafting fanatics are always there to help if you need them!We’re super excited for you to experience LGR.Ciao!Marco",21.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Whats a Bundle?</h3>
<p>A Bundle Box is a non existent thing that I hope can fully exist before the end of this year(TBD).</p>
<p>They are essentially gift boxes. However the items inside are all handmade, or created by Studio Dodge. Your bundle would have items such as small art prints, vinyl stickers, pins, 3d printed earrings, soy candles, and potentially a lot more. I enjoy producing goods in small batches, with simple ingredients, these are the calm things of my work. While my illustration and artwork is where my mind plays forever until we are done.</p>
<p>The first bundle is more developed so far and I already have some items ready to make things.</p>
<p>You can find the descriptions of the bundles down below in the HAPPY MAIL section</p>
<h3>OH HEY THERE</h3>
<p><strong>I'm Dani </strong>and I'm an artist. I've been making art under my business Studio Dodge since 2014. Since September I've been experiencing some hardship in my personal life regarding my my husband and our non consensual forced legal separation. That's a fun sentence.  What it really means is I’m cut off from coordinating my finances with my husband for a while, and it could be easy or hard for an even longer unknown amount of time.</p>
<p>I'm looking for some mental, emotional, and financial supports and minor comforts to help me while I have an unsteady paycheck with my art business, and continue to meet challenges the courts present.</p>
<p>This felt personal enough that I wanted to launch this separately from my business. It feels right in my gut, so I'll let my tax pal Abi help me out with that later. I also spend a lot of time calculating what's possible on my studio budget while also coordinating other life things, there's a lot to do running a smolbiz. This is truly for my peace of mind, and so my friends know I'll be okay. Thanks for bein here.</p>

<h3><i>Your Happy Mail</i></h3>
<p>When you support please let me know what bundles you would like to receive</p>
<p>A. Preorder one box, you choose what theme</p>
<p>B. Preorder one of each box</p>
<p>C. Preorder one box (you choose) and support the extra personal art projects +100</p>
<p>D. Preorder all boxes and support the extra personal art projects+150</p>
<p> Moon Bundle: Reversible/Double-Sided Art Print including an original block print, handmade soy candle, handmade soap, vinyl sticker, 3d Printed earrings featuring a crescent moon and a dangling freshwater pearl(you can choose a matching or asymmetrical pair).

<p>Morning Bundle: Brainstorming so far includes a set of morning beverage mini art prints, 3d printed latte earrings, soy candle, coffee scrub, vinyl sticker, and who knows what else we can cram in there. Think morning vibes, warm colors, coffee beans, citrus, inspiring start to the day.</p>
<p>Botanicals Bundle: Brainstorming so far includes plant shaped 3-d printed earrings, botanical bath items, house plant inspired art print, soy candle, wooden pin, vinyl sticker, and who knows what else I can cram in there. Think modern mother earth vibes, or cool plont stuff.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If I'm able to fund this project and gain some stability for a longer road on the heels of an already difficult pandemic....</p>
<ul>
<li>I can create the work that I feel called to make</li>
<li>I gain some freedom to decline some projects I would have accepted just for fast cash.</li>
<li>While my relationship rides the waves of the court system, this project might be able to boost my business to another level of stability that it can sustain on its own. I'm trying to project for longevity here. I can't be making a campaign every time I need help, ya know? Writing all this is a lot of work.</li>
<li>You support an artist personally, while also getting cool stuff instead of having to talk about her depressing love life.</li>
<li>Lets be real, financial stability helps me sleep better at night, and I've been sleeping on a not-bed since last fall. I may be able to improve my life a lil bit while I tough out this season of life.</li>
</ul>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Other Ways To Help</h3>
<p>Extra Art Funding: I want to work on a symbolism heavy  feminist themed /mythololgy /femme/fauna/flora.... Um. Series of paintings? Its in my brain, and I have concept maps and thumbnail sketches, playlists slowly building... for this 3 piece series I want to paint. If things go well with this campaign I'll use funds to get me the time away from my client projects to work on this series that might burn a hole in me if I don't paint it. You know that feeling? Me too. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a potter, animal lover and all around fun loving person. I have been doing pottery for the past 2 years, and I was hooked from the first moment I stepped into a wheel class. I started my own pottery studio beginning of 2018, and I have been obsessed with making this my full time career since then.</p>
<p>My campaign is aimed at building myself a well equipped, light space with enough shelving to be able to do this full time. I absolutely adore what I do, and it would mean the world to me to be able to this full time.</p>
<p>Contributors will not only be able to pick a limited edition, handmade item for their home, but also help me doing what I love on a full time basis.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funds I raise from this campaign will go towards building my dream pottery studio in my backyard, that is currently unused space. The new studio will be better laid out to increase my production, and really help me create more that I can sell.</p>
<p>My exclusive, limited edition I created specifically for this campaign is completely hand made from start to finish. The Table Mountain silhouette is either hand carved into the clay or hand painted in gold lustre over the glaze. Every single step is done by me, personally, to ensure you get a truly unique, one of a kind piece.</p>
<p>If the target is not reached, the funds raised will go towards starting to build the new studio and as more funds become available, finishing it.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Other than being able to do pottery full time, I envision the new space to be better laid out for workshops. I love teaching, and I really enjoy showing other potters how to create their pieces with less effort with certain techniques I've learned over the past two years. It is another dream of mine to present workshops to people from all over the world on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>I am truly grateful for finding this incredible art form, and that it is a possibility for me to do this on a full time basis. </p>
<p>I am a bit of a night owl, so having the new studio at home would really help me create whenever I can.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I am dedicated to seeing this campaign through to the end, and do whatever I can to raise enough to make this dream a reality.</p>
<p>The current studio is on my patio, and being rather open to the elements can get very cold in winter and boiling hot in summer. The new space will be a closed space, and will have ceiling fans for the hot summer days, and heaters for the cold winter days.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to contribute to my campaign, I would greatly appreciate you sharing my campaign with your friends and family on social media. Indiegogo has some incredible sharing tools for exactly this reason.</p>

<p>From the same strange mind that created the mysterious Lucky Potion Oracle and the bizarre Oddity Tarot, comes an all new, immersive oracle deck experience inspired by Exquisite Corpses (a children's drawing game), Witch Familiars, and Legacy-Style Gaming.  You'll encounter magical creatures that will impart Wisdom, Guidance, and Daily Affirmations. </p>

It has been an amazing, demanding, and elucidating process!<br/><br/>This book was written for you, the one working to bring your own dream into the world.

<p>Hello Friends!! I’m Zee, an artist focused on work that explores our inner, emotional worlds. I believe tarot's marriage of art and symbolism make it a powerful tool for examining ourselves and our circumstances. I'm excited to bring you our newest, most fun and playful project....</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1634039703/y3g0u2ewpgy4zux4a8nf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>This is a unique deck as it has a transparent background, is designed for layering the cards on top of each other, overlapping, and more! Because they overlap, and This deck is a fantastic tool for developing your intuition. it breaths new life into the 78 cards with its layering of the artwork by introducing a new medium to tarot. The ability to layer the cards to create a whole picture brings a whole new dimension to the reading, it has created a true shift in the ways a card spread can be interpreted. This deck is for anyone who loves cats, loves working with the Tarot as a personal tool of self discovery and self care, for anyone who wants to stimulates and awakens your intuition, this will be a profound addition to your Tarot collection.</p>

<h3><strong>ABOUT ME</strong></h3>
<p>My name is Loan Favan, I am an<strong> </strong>artist and a jewelry designer from New Caledonia, a french island located in the Pacific Ocean. I am the founder of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/naula_studio/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Naula_studio</a>, a jewelry company now based in Bali, Indonesia. The leitmotiv of my work is my Pacific origins. I feel the urge to give back to my island and spread our culture through my minimal and futuristic designs. And therefore create more than simple jewelry pieces, but rather 'modern artefacts' holding ancestral and mystical power.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>THE PROJECT</strong></h3>
<p><i>""Most of our traditions as islanders are rooted in the past and passed on by speech. Which made me wonder how our heritage will evolve or even survive in the future.""</i></p>
<p><strong>Ngei will be a collection of 5 monumental accessories inspired by the Kanak artifacts. The collection pays tribute to traditions and bring it into the future.</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>THE RESEARCH</strong></h3>
<p>Being from New Caledonia, which is a french colony I never got to learn the customs of my own land and culture. With this project, I have taken steps back and learnt about my own origins and land. I hope this project can help our community to come back closer to their roots.</p>
<p>In the making process of the collection I have researched the history of our objects and legends to create pieces that will become more than jewelry, but part of tradition. I integrated details from the huts, the sacred wooden sculptures, the engraved bamboos...symbols that founded our past and that I believe can still be part of our future.</p>

<h3><strong>THE CONTRIBUTION </strong></h3>
<p>To contribute to the emergence and remembrance of our heritage, I need your support. Each donation will help realize the metal pieces, the photoshoot, the 3D animated stories and exhibition. I would also like to give 10% of this project to <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/noumeafashionweek?locale=fr_FR"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Noumea Fashion Week</a>, to encourage other creatives of the island to create in ambitious and bold ways for our community.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>THE RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</h3>
<div>
<p>This is an ambitious project that involves the production of complex metal pieces and advanced visual making but this is not my first big production. I have realised a short film dedicated to my island; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ig6aNQ9XWD0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LAKEBO</a> in 2019 back in New Caledonia, managing several collaborations and productions. Moreover I have been developing<a href=""https://www.naulastudio.com/lookbook"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> jewelry pieces</a> since 2019 and distributing them on <a href=""https://www.naulastudio.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Naula_studio</a> worldwide. In 2020 I created a futuristic jewelry collection which is now part of the <a href=""https://designmuseum.nl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Design Museum of Denbosch</a> collection, <a href=""https://designmuseum.nl/derde-verdieping/posthuman/sieraden-voor-een-onoverwinnelijke-cyborg/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Alliage-Cu29Zn30</a>.</p>
<p>However, delays due to unforeseen obstacles can occur especially during the current health crisis. But I made sure the schedule will allow delays. Also by only working with the best producers and manufacturers, I am confident the project can be complete successfully.<br/><br/>At all times, I will be as transparent as possible and keep you up to date with the progress!</p>

New swag will be available only to Backers of this project (you will be invited to a secret store after the campaign is completed)Also, JUST for this project, you can add Exclusive RARE MERCH only available when you buy the book... and NOT available anywhere else.  Such as Hats, banners, pins and and more. Here is an example of one of the items that will be available to Indiegogo Supporters after the campaign ends successfully.  You will be able to add these to your order during the final checkout process after the campaign is completed. Max Boost - He is the underdog, and our unlikely hero.  Max is absolutely passionate about cars and racing, and will do anything it takes to find, build, and race the car of his dreams.  His number one enemy is Todd, and he is committed to bringing street-justice to Motorville by having Todd pay for all of the horrible things he does to those who have less horsepower than him.And, as the story develops, we find out what roles these characters play, as the very existence of Motorville may actually depend on this young group of street-rascals...Otto - is Max's best friend and voice of reason.  Otto is basically the opposite of Max, as he is calm, collected, and is always thinking wisely.  However, he also knows it's almost impossible to stop Max when he has a ""great idea"", and knows it's better just get out of his way (and sometimes more entertaining!).  As a master tactician, Otto, has the skill of gently guiding Max along so he doesn't hurt himself... too much.Todd -  Big V8, BIG Pistons, and even BIGGER EGO.  Todd is the town jock that you love to hate, and he makes it a ""sport"" to harass Max and Otto, and anyone else under 500 horsepower.  Maybe one day, Max and Otto will be able to teach him a lesson in humility, but they will need to find some horsepower and torque first!Papa Wheely and his henchmen, Yin, Yan and Wok - He has the Horsepower and Torque!  Papa Wheely is the Proprietor of Papa Wheely's Performance Pagoda.  He's the one to see if you want you tuner car, tuned - but for a PRICE!AND, if you don't make your payments on time, you may end up meeting the his ""Wu Tang Wack!""Ese and 'Efe - The leaders of the Low Rider crew from Low Co., Ese and Efe' patrol the streets of Lotting Park - with 3 wheel motion, on chrome & white walls.  Don't get caught by them at the wrong time, in the wrong place, or you might find yourself getting ""hit by switches"".Rip, Slug, Torch- Three mysterious bad dudes from a mysterious place have come to Motorville with suspicious motives.  Are they just looters? Or are the part of a bigger plan leading to the distruction of Motorville?  Let's find out...And, that's not all, there are many, many more characters in Max Boost for you to meet!And included in the NEW Max Boost Volume 3.1, new characters such as Racerette, Trixie, Dizzy Dubz and other surprise characters will be making an appearance!The Max Boost studio is located in Mission Valley, San Diego, California.Hi!  My name is Dennis, and Max Boost is my comic that was featured in Import Tuner Magazine!As a kid my dream has always been to work in the comic industry.Luckily as a teenager, I was able to accomplish that by working for different comic companies. My Turbo Integra GS-R that was featured in Turbo Magazine back in 1997!During that time in the 90’s, I got my first new car - an Acura Integra GSR which ignited my passion for racing and cars - and my car was even featured in Turbo MagazineSo just like the anime Initial D, I wanted to combine my passion for Cars and Comics to create my own called Max Boost.If you don’t know Max Boost, you may know the magazine it was published in- a magazine I helped create and design in 1998-called Import Tunerwhich had about 1 Million readers per month.Unfortunately, after almost a decade of drawing, animating, and entertaining fans…. I abruptly stopped In 2006.The truth was we almost struck a massive deal with Warner Bros, and due to unfortunate circumstances, it got cancelled, I hit rock bottom and lost almost everything.Fans were wondering what happened, and where I went.And during these tough years, a highlight would be When I would randomly meet fans -and they would ask me to bring Max Boost back…So I knew I would come back,I just didn’t know when.The Max Boost Midori Civic, known as ""Mikey ^2"" is being built to eventually replicate the Max Boost Civic in the comic!So a couple of years ago I brought Max Boost classic issues back with Volume 1 and Volume 2.  It was a huge success!Between the two books, we finally reprinted ALL the classic issues of Max Boost that were published in IT from 1998-2006.I definitely am not doing this alone - it takes a lot of support from industry partners, friends, family, and a solid team. NOW the Max Boost Omnibus is the COMPLETE COLLECTION PLUS BRAND NEW PAGES OF MAX BOOST!!!During our last two campaigns, things blew up!Because of your support , we put life back into Max Boost Again!Building cars, racing, Sketching, Doing collabs, on podcasts, And even signing at the Honda booth at SEMAMax Boost Team cars - Micheal Bush ""Natsuki"" S2000 (Global Time Attack Car), HKS Supercharged & Mike Servin's EK hatch (Show Stoppah) powered by B15C5 Type R. So now after 15 long years I MADE IT here on Indiegogo to say:I'm FINALLY going to continue the Max Boost story line in a new book.  With your help, for the first time in forever….

<h3>Who is Barry Atwood?</h3>
<p>Barry Atwood is taking part in Abrams Claghorn Gallery's 3rd annual professional development course. The course is designed to mentor and prepare selected artists for a gallery show. The course includes a three month program finishing with a summer exhibition debuting new works by each selected artist. this year, 3 selected artists are working with industry professionals to develop their artist statements, curatorial skills, and create new work ahead of the exhibition open date.</p>
<h3>Barry Atwood's Story</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Born in 1948, Barry Atwood was infected with Polio at age three and for the next three years was confined to an iron lung, unable to open or close his eyes. The sense of absolute helplessness had a lasting impact on his life, his art, and his drive for independence.  In 1955, his grandfather was elected to the board of education, which enabled him to become the first disabled child to be mainstreamed into grade school, middle and high school. Later, he became the first full-time disabled student to attend the University of New Mexico and to live in the student dormitories. </p>
<p>Upon graduation, Atwood’s Grandfather gave him a camera and he enrolled in a photography class.  The result has been his lifelong obsession with the power of photography to capture an instant in time and express the wide spectrum of meaning found in the image. He later moved to Los Angeles and worked as a photographer in the entertainment industry, until he was accepted as the first disabled student at the UCLA School of Architecture.  The studios were located on the second floor, so his classmates carried him up and down the 27 steps to the second floor at least twice a day for two years; before an elevator was installed.</p>
<p>After finishing at UCLA, Atwood worked as a consultant on a wide range of architectural projects, including making private buildings or facilities accessible to individuals with disabilities and providing accommodations that facilitated the employment of the disabled.  Meanwhile, he used photography as the primary outlet for his creative impulse and began a lasting infatuation with the natural world and photographing landscapes. Combining his economic and artistic lives led him to join the US Access Board’s committee that created accessibility related specifications regulating the design and construction of trails serving the natural world.  In recent years he has discovered the city as a subject, with a focus on making  abstract images using elements found in the urban environment.</p>
<p>Recently, the pandemic forced the closure of his office and his deteriorating health has forced him to retire.  The cost of living in the Bay Area is high and Social Security is very limited, which has created several economic burdens.  However, his art is the refuge from the storm and sharing his visions with an audience is a bright light feeding his soul.</p>
<p>Barry Atwood was recently accepted into Abrams Claghorn Gallery's annual Emerging Artist Showcase. For his upcoming exhibition, he needs to frame the  photographs that will be shown. </p>

I am also an art instructor who, fifteen years ago, fearing a communist takeover, emigrated to the U.S. from her country of origin, Venezuela. <br/><br/>[I have to apologize for the very amateur video here on my page, as it was recorded by me alone, with zero experience in video-making, using my cell and with very little time to do it.

As any artist, I have gone through progressive stages. Today, some see me as a visual storyteller, as my work always has something to say to the viewer.

Thanks for taking interest in my page. My name is Corina S. Alvarezdelugo, or simply Corina. I am a professional mixed media painter and sculptor. I am also an art instructor who, fifteen years ago, fearing a communist takeover, emigrated to the U.S. from her country of origin, Venezuela. [I have to apologize for the very amateur video here on my page, as it was recorded by me alone, with zero experience in video-making, using my cell and with very little time to do it. Therefore, I'm sharing this interview
 that just came up on the air, about my most recent body of 
work, on the Connecticut Public Television (CPTV) – Spotlight on the 
Arts’ segment- This way you can get a better idea of who I am and what my work is about... Here’s the link: http://youtu.be/2Y8N31spX6g]After obtaining my degree in Arts, twelve years of intensive work, and literally hundreds of exhibitions, I have been offered a merit-based grant and work-exchange fellowship to attend a life changing “artist in-residency” program at the prestigious Vermont Studio Center in Johnson, VT. To that end, I am eligible for partial aid, but… I dearly need additional support. A little about myself. As any artist, I have gone through progressive stages. Today, some see me as a visual storyteller, as my work always has something to say to the viewer. As a concerned citizen, often times my works have taken position on some troubling issues of our time: global warming, our environment, violations of human rights, and on the tragedy being lived in the country where I grew up.                  The Truth is Shining Through, 2014 Encaustic, textiles, ink on panel; 12"" x 12"" x 1.5""

<p>The idea for Rockins came from our youngest artist and writer, Ashley Bishop. Ashley loves to write stories and paint, so she suggested that we create a business doing the things we all love. It would bring us closer and give everyone an equal sense of contribution and pride. Not to mention we're having a blast working together! Rose prefers to paint most of the time, while Sierra is a master of character creation.  So if you like great art and intriguing stories, we think you'll love our Rockins!</p>

They decided to form the Intergalactic Adoption Agency and find homes for their Rockins all over the world!

<h3>The Fort</h3>
<p>I'm Minx, I am the creative leader of my Burning Man group for <a href=""http://www.lakesoffire.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lakes of Fire</a> 2015.  The community is so special because we live by the guiding <a href=""http://burningman.org/culture/philosophical-center/10-principles/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">principles</a>, which have completely changed my outlook on life. I see that there is so much life, excitement and endless ability to create and embrace! I have developed quite a passion and respect for the creativity that the people bring to the table, and it has inspired me! I have been involved in the Burning Man community for 10 years, and as my celebratory 10 year anniversary project, I envisioned The Fort.  The Fort will further be supported by and created through the efforts of my wonderful burner family, The Good Vibe Tribe, a/k/a ""The Squirrels.""</p>
<p>The Fort will be a communal gathering point. A place where people can meet new friends. A place to schedule meet ups with your crew. A place that can be explored and experienced. <span> A place to be a big kid again! The vision is to create an alluring, climbable, tri-tower double-decker play structure!</span></p>
<p><span>Just image...</span></p>
<p><span>You walk down the dusty road, and come upon a massive structure, looking somewhat like a castle with colorful flags adorning The Fort, flying in the wind like they are announcing the celebration of your arrival.  You can't wait to check it out. You start by racing your friend up the 15 foot vertical cargo net. Trying out each playful way to get to the top level of the towers. Zipping down the slide.  Feeling the wind in your hair as you swing freely on the dual swings. Being rambunctious by swaying and swirling around on the tire swing with your friend, flipping and twisting on the aerial hoop,  playing with the contraptions on the Fort, like the pulley flag race between towers. Dance to our neighboring sound camp's thumpin' beats as you dance freely under the sun or stars from one of the three top platforms. Or you may want to rest your feet and kick back on the bottom shaded platform,  You may peek through the top floor's spy glass to see what's going on at the camps all the way on the other side of the lake, but not that you'd really want to leave all the fun you're having!     (Check out our GALLERY at the top of the page for our draft designs and various images!)</span></p>
<p><span>The Good Vibe tribe is also bringing out our 2012 theme camp pieces, so you are welcome to also challenge your friend to a foam sword fight on the balance beam, or rebound a fly ball when playing with the bucket ball post, or perhaps the colorful balls of the giant kerplunk will entice you to challenge a stranger!</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>I personally love installations that I can physically explore and interact with and embody a fun ‘Hey, let’s go do that!’ vibe.  The gravitation towards the Fort will be strong!  </span><span>Plato once said, ""Life must be lived as play"", and I couldn't agree more! We forget that play keeps us young!   The Fort will provide a destination that allows you to be fully present in the moment and will surely add to countless people's sense of exploration and enjoyment!</span></p>
<p>We will build this in such a way that we can tear down and re-build the structure every year without any damage, so the project will live on and will evolve to be even more exciting and interactive! </p>
</div><h3>What We Need to make it happen!</h3><ul>
<li>$1,500 is our fundraising goal</li>
<li>This goal only accounts for 1/3 of the project's costs.</li>
<li>Your contributions go towards lumber, hardware, the swings and other play items, and transportation costs.</li>
<li>To make up the remainder of our costs, we have several other interactive fundraising parties planned over the next several months</li>
</ul><h3>Your Impact</h3><p>Any denomination that you can provide will be quite helpful!</p><ul>
<li>$25 could help us buy a swing</li>
<li>$50 could help us purchase the fabric needed for The Fort's flags</li>
<li>$75 would pay for the flooring for one tower</li>
<li>$100 could help us build a slide</li>

Being rambunctious by swaying and swirling around on the tire swing with your friend, flipping and twisting on the aerial hoop,  playing with the contraptions on the Fort, like the pulley flag race between towers. Dance to our neighboring sound camp's thumpin' beats as you dance freely under the sun or stars from one of the three top platforms. Or you may want to rest your feet and kick back on the bottom shaded platform,  You may peek through the top floor's spy glass to see what's going on at the camps all the way on the other side of the lake, but not that you'd really want to leave all the fun you're having!     (Check out our GALLERY at the top of the page for our draft designs and various images!)
The Good Vibe tribe is also bringing out our 2012 theme camp pieces, so you are welcome to also challenge your friend to a foam sword fight on the balance beam, or rebound a fly ball when playing with the bucket ball post, or perhaps the colorful balls of the giant kerplunk will entice you to challenge a stranger!
 
I personally love installations that I can physically explore and interact with and embody a fun ‘Hey, let’s go do that!’ vibe.  The gravitation towards the Fort will be strong!  Plato once said, ""Life must be lived as play"", and I couldn't agree more! We forget that play keeps us young!   The Fort will provide a destination that allows you to be fully present in the moment and will surely add to countless people's sense of exploration and enjoyment!
We will build this in such a way that we can tear down and re-build the structure every year without any damage, so the project will live on and will evolve to be even more exciting and interactive! 
What We Need to make it happen!
$1,500 is our fundraising goal
This goal only accounts for 1/3 of the project's costs.
Your contributions go towards lumber, hardware, the swings and other play items, and transportation costs.
To make up the remainder of our costs, we have several other interactive fundraising parties planned over the next several months
Your ImpactAny denomination that you can provide will be quite helpful!
$25 could help us buy a swing
$50 could help us purchase the fabric needed for The Fort's flags
$75 would pay for the flooring for one tower
$100 could help us build a slide
$250 helps us safely light the structure for night play
$700 would pay for our transportation costs
$850 would pay for all the custom made brackets needed to support The Fort
$1000 could help build an entire tower, 3 are needed 
Endless gratitude from my heart to yours for taking the time to read about our project for Lakes of Fire 2015. Thank you for any contributions you're able to provide! Thank you! Namaste!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

She is interested in harnessing the use of new mobile technologies, not only to make her work more accessible, but to merge the digital and real world through artistic practice.</p><p> As a digital composer and sonic artist she wishes to marry contemporary music and visual practices with the latest in interactive technologies.</p><p>Bernadette will be showing three separate works at FRAMEWERK.</p><h4>The Virtual Performer</h4><p>This is a standalone holographic work inspired by the 'Virtual Assistants' introduced at airports some years ago. </p><p><span>The work consists of a video recording of the singer Sarmen Almond performing a score written by Comac and projected onto holographic screen material, attached to a cut out figure.</span><br/></p><p>The vocal piece itself is preoccupied with current ideas in world affairs. Comac was influenced by the ' Occupy' movement and its concerns with global issues.</p><p> Sarmen Almond, the performer, has an extended range of vocal sounds. Comac explored the use of these in expressing the real frustrations and generalised inertia in the face of real or perceived political inequalities. </p><p>Apart from the vocal work, there is a short spoken section which addresses the need for acceptance of post trauma in the context of the 'Troubles'.</p><h4>STUX IV series for ibeacons</h4><p>STUX IV is a series of sonic works which make use of Apple’s indoor positioning technology, iBeacon, to bring an augmented reality experience to your mobile phone. </p><p>Small devices called ‘Estimotes’ will be attached to a wall within the gallery. These devices act as bluetooth beacons which send push notifications to your mobile phone and prompt you to open an app to play the an original sound work by Comac.</p><p>In order for the the piece to work the audience are to download the app ‘Locly’ from the Apple store.</p><h4>STUX V series for Augmented Reality</h4><p>STUV V is a series of works invoking elements of Augmented Reality (AR). AR is used to bridge the real world and the digital. Google glass became well known for using such software. </p><p>Comac has set out to incorporate the use of AR in creating a new platform for her work.</p><p></p><p><span>Audiences are to download an app called ‘Aurasma’ which works on both IOS and Android devices. Headphones are recommended.</span></p>In this series, Comac has created framed works which are part score representations of the sonic pieces. When the images are scanned using mobiles devices, multimedia works are presented on screen. These framed pieces will be made available to funding patrons.<div><br/></div><div>

<h4>Saul Rayson</h4>
<p>  Saul Rayson is a composer, improviser and percussionist who has worked across many musical styles.</p>
<p> In recent years Rayson has been experimenting and extending his sound with computer environments, Supercollider and Pure Data.</p>
<p> He also builds various hardware hacks and instruments for sound manipulation, composition and improvisation. </p>
<p>With this particular piece, the use of older and simpler technologies has been utilised, partly for their sonic misconduct and partly as a comment on the world's continual updating of technology and pristine digital recording.</p>
<h4> 'Augmented Resonating Snare Drum' </h4>
<p>Rayson will modify a snare drum with resonant bars, which are suspended through the snare skin. </p>
<p>A micro speaker is attached to the snare and a contact mic is attached to the opposite side, t<span>he microphone is attached to a small amp. </span></p>
<p>Various items are also available to be added to the snare drum, which interfere with the harmonic resonance of the drum. <span>An old four track tape machine will feed the speaker with a selection pre recorded material, which the audience can mix.</span></p>
<p>Saul will also have an improvised performance, with the addition of different snare excitation and feedback loops.</p>

<h4>John Macormac</h4>
<p>John is an artist
currently undertaking a Master of Fine Art course at the Belfast School of Art.
His current practice involves rule driven wall drawing, improvised drum performance
and the manipulation of recorded video and sound.</p>
<p>His
work explores pattern through
mathematics, geometry, structure and environment. Process is key; time, action,
choice and human agency are carefully considered. Work seeks to develop a
connection between processes of the natural world and those of artistic creation,
and to deconstruct the heroic expressive act of the artist. He
achieves this through adherence to quasi
scientific, systematic methods.</p>
<p><b>Semi-structured
improvisation exploring order and chaos</b></p>
<p>A rule driven wall
drawing has been carried out on the gallery wall. The complex, mesh like
circular form is the result of building up many layers. John and Ben
Behzadafshar will respond to the drawing and the gallery environment through a
semi-structured improvisation piece performed on drums and guitar with multiple
effects pedals. </p>
<p>This performance,
and other planned performances over the course of BASS will be documented on
video which will be projected in the gallery dark space and be available to
listen to through headphones. </p>

<h4>James Robert Moore</h4>James Robert Moore is a visual artist and musician, who since 2008 has been recording and releasing music under the name of 'Black Mountain Transmitter'. <p>Moore creates instrumental soundscapes influenced by a diet of weird horror fiction, VHS era Video Nasty soundtracks, Radiophonic Workshop sonic trickery and the abject electronics of early Industrial music pioneers such as Throbbing Gristle and SPK. </p>
<p>Black Mountain Transmitter’s 'Black Goat of the Woods' (2009) has been released, and sold out, on three different record labels including Auris Apothecary (USA) and Aurora Borealis (UK).  Along with 'Playing With Dead Things' (2012) it forms the first two parts of a yet to be completed 'Trilogy of Terror'.</p>
<p>Black Mountain Transmitter rarely performs live but has made appearances at three Outer Church events curated by the Wire magazine’s Joseph Stannard and the Unearthing Forgotten Horrors festival in Newcastle Upon Tyne.</p>
<p>He has also released music under his own name as well as the aliases of Cloudland Ballroom and Sapir Whorf.  </p>
<p>His visual artwork has been featured on cassette releases by the Forced Nostalgia label and Ekoplekz’s 'Four Track Mind' double LP released on Planet Mu.</p>
<h4>'A Short History Of Decay - Part 1'</h4>
<p>Moore will produce a limited edition (25 copies) of a 30 minute audio cassette recording, accompanied and packaged with a Xerox printed zine and silkscreened print on newsprint. </p>
<p></p>
<p><span>One copy of the cassette will be available to listen to in the gallery during the run of the exhibition, on a provided cassette Walkman and earphones. Displayed along with the zine and print. </span></p>The production of both the sound and visual components will utilise outdated and lo-fi production methods in a celebration of high noise to signal ratio and degraded information.<br/><p>Black Mountain Transmitter will be performing as part of the exhibition.</p>

<b>'Recollection/ Dissolution'</b><br/><br/>Hadi and Li-Li will be presenting a multi-media work: painting / sound installation, that explores the relationship between ‘recorded’ and ‘remembered.’ <br/><br/>The idea shaped out of a sketched portrait that they produced in October 2014. The work is a remake of that sketch in the context of its original production time through painting and sound. <br/><br/>'Remembrance is always accompanied by disruptive noises; senses coming from the times that are not necessarily related to a specific memory,' they say. Their memory of that sketch was an amalgamation of different layers of images and sounds. That's why they have used certain techniques to fabricate that fragmented, layered memory in a multi-media work.<p class=""""><br/></p>

Thus, the exhibition is comprised of a month long series of activities. These include singular and collaborative sound exhibitions, performances, workshops and presentations.   Due to the specificity of the medium, the ongoing Arts funding cuts and local culture in terms of exhibition attendance, we have decided to use the crowd funding platform 'Indiegogo' to support both the Gallery and each Artist during this time. For this purpose, the Artists have created a series of unique and innovative rewards for funding patrons.Here is a run down of each Artist and the work they will be submitting throughout the month, with your help and generous donations.Rui ChavesPrimarily an Artist and Researcher, Chaves' work is an on-going interdisciplinary sound based artistic practice with site-specific interventions, video art, mixed-media installation and community art projects.Chaves has presented his work in Canada, Brazil and Europe. 
'I Walk In The Sand Towards The Ocean.' 
Chaves will also show an original piece of his audio-visual work, the title of which clearly delineates the core action in the piece.Forming part of an audiovisual interplay in which the visual composition and microphone position emphasises not only the sonic effect of walking in sand, but also a spatial and sonic transition. The body moving through a landscape elicits a process that translates critical issues in field recording: human agency, presence and place-mediation strategies.www.ruichaves.comBarry CullenBarry Joseph Cullen (born 1977) is a Belfast based  Audio and Video Artist who has worked, performed and researched in Europe, North and South America.His practice includes delivering DIY electronics, audio tech and motion graphics workshops, interactive AV installation works, DJing, VJing and creative technical support.'Analogue Granular'Cullen will set up a prawn cracker with piezo/contact microphone, clamped and attached to 9v dirty amplifier. The audience will be supplied with soy sauce, pipette dropper and spare crackers then encouraged to drop soy sauce on said prawn cracker.A mono cassette tape player will play a handmade looped tape recording of the amped up foodstuff in actionThe objects will be exhibited along with some black and white Lino Print images and text, the same images Cullen will make available for funding patrons.https://barryjosephcullen.wordpress.com/Christian Donaghey Christian is a 21 year old musician and sonic artist, currently based in Derry.

The feeling and movement of the music is inspired by Donaghey's consistent health disturbances and obsession with existentialism. This will be Christian's second  solo sonic performance. Expect a live spectacle made up of crowd interactions and spontaneous actions. https://www.facebook.com/Autumns.Band The HostBased between London and Northern Ireland, Barry Lynn has been issuing forward thinking electronic music though labels such as Planet Mu, Hotflush and Cosmic Bridge for over a decade.Under the guise of The Host, he has combined his natural musicianship with hazed hypnagogic melodies and tranced-out 21st century psychedelia.Touch Sensitive Presents The Host (live) As a pre-cursor to the release of the Esalen Lectures LP, Touch Sensitive presents The Host live as part of BASS. Inspired by mind-expanding ‘happenings’, as opposed to linear gig set-ups, and the NorCal psychedelic retreat referenced in the Esalen Lectures, the evening will include a live guitar and hardware set from The Host alongside complimentary visuals and records selected by Touch Sensitive DJs in a fully immersive sensory experience.Using sweeping synthesizer patterns and subtle field recordings, The Host creates dramatic arcs. Spiralling guitar squalls meet blissed-out, motionless womb lullabies and digitally-enhanced nocturnes to tell a weird story of induction, hypnosis and psychic disturbance. https://www.facebook.com/events/472034336280139/Bernadette ComacComac's work entails the use of new internet technologies in multimedia works and live performance. She is interested in harnessing the use of new mobile technologies, not only to make her work more accessible, but to merge the digital and real world through artistic practice. As a digital composer and sonic artist she wishes to marry contemporary music and visual practices with the latest in interactive technologies.Bernadette will be showing three separate works at FRAMEWERK.The Virtual PerformerThis is a standalone holographic work inspired by the 'Virtual Assistants' introduced at airports some years ago. The work consists of a video recording of the singer Sarmen Almond performing a score written by Comac and projected onto holographic screen material, attached to a cut out figure.The vocal piece itself is preoccupied with current ideas in world affairs. Comac was influenced by the ' Occupy' movement and its concerns with global issues. Sarmen Almond, the performer, has an extended range of vocal sounds. Comac explored the use of these in expressing the real frustrations and generalised inertia in the face of real or perceived political inequalities. Apart from the vocal work, there is a short spoken section which addresses the need for acceptance of post trauma in the context of the 'Troubles'.STUX IV series for ibeaconsSTUX IV is a series of sonic works which make use of Apple’s indoor positioning technology, iBeacon, to bring an augmented reality experience to your mobile phone. Small devices called ‘Estimotes’ will be attached to a wall within the gallery. These devices act as bluetooth beacons which send push notifications to your mobile phone and prompt you to open an app to play the an original sound work by Comac.In order for the the piece to work the audience are to download the app ‘Locly’ from the Apple store.STUX V series for Augmented RealitySTUV V is a series of works invoking elements of Augmented Reality (AR). AR is used to bridge the real world and the digital. Google glass became well known for using such software. Comac has set out to incorporate the use of AR in creating a new platform for her work.Audiences are to download an app called ‘Aurasma’ which works on both IOS and Android devices. Headphones are recommended.In this series, Comac has created framed works which are part score representations of the sonic pieces. When the images are scanned using mobiles devices, multimedia works are presented on screen. These framed pieces will be made available to funding patrons.

Saul Rayson
  Saul Rayson is a composer, improviser and percussionist who has worked across many musical styles.
 In recent years Rayson has been experimenting and extending his sound with computer environments, Supercollider and Pure Data.
 He also builds various hardware hacks and instruments for sound manipulation, composition and improvisation. 
With this particular piece, the use of older and simpler technologies has been utilised, partly for their sonic misconduct and partly as a comment on the world's continual updating of technology and pristine digital recording.
 'Augmented Resonating Snare Drum' 
Rayson will modify a snare drum with resonant bars, which are suspended through the snare skin. 
A micro speaker is attached to the snare and a contact mic is attached to the opposite side, the microphone is attached to a small amp. 
Various items are also available to be added to the snare drum, which interfere with the harmonic resonance of the drum. An old four track tape machine will feed the speaker with a selection pre recorded material, which the audience can mix.
Saul will also have an improvised performance, with the addition of different snare excitation and feedback loops.

John Macormac
John is an artist
currently undertaking a Master of Fine Art course at the Belfast School of Art.
His current practice involves rule driven wall drawing, improvised drum performance
and the manipulation of recorded video and sound.
His
work explores pattern through
mathematics, geometry, structure and environment. Process is key; time, action,
choice and human agency are carefully considered. Work seeks to develop a
connection between processes of the natural world and those of artistic creation,
and to deconstruct the heroic expressive act of the artist. He
achieves this through adherence to quasi
scientific, systematic methods.
Semi-structured
improvisation exploring order and chaos
A rule driven wall
drawing has been carried out on the gallery wall. The complex, mesh like
circular form is the result of building up many layers. John and Ben
Behzadafshar will respond to the drawing and the gallery environment through a
semi-structured improvisation piece performed on drums and guitar with multiple
effects pedals. 
This performance,
and other planned performances over the course of BASS will be documented on
video which will be projected in the gallery dark space and be available to
listen to through headphones.

James Robert MooreJames Robert Moore is a visual artist and musician, who since 2008 has been recording and releasing music under the name of 'Black Mountain Transmitter'. Moore creates instrumental soundscapes influenced by a diet of weird horror fiction, VHS era Video Nasty soundtracks, Radiophonic Workshop sonic trickery and the abject electronics of early Industrial music pioneers such as Throbbing Gristle and SPK. 
Black Mountain Transmitter’s 'Black Goat of the Woods' (2009) has been released, and sold out, on three different record labels including Auris Apothecary (USA) and Aurora Borealis (UK).  Along with 'Playing With Dead Things' (2012) it forms the first two parts of a yet to be completed 'Trilogy of Terror'.
Black Mountain Transmitter rarely performs live but has made appearances at three Outer Church events curated by the Wire magazine’s Joseph Stannard and the Unearthing Forgotten Horrors festival in Newcastle Upon Tyne.
He has also released music under his own name as well as the aliases of Cloudland Ballroom and Sapir Whorf.  
His visual artwork has been featured on cassette releases by the Forced Nostalgia label and Ekoplekz’s 'Four Track Mind' double LP released on Planet Mu.
'A Short History Of Decay - Part 1'
Moore will produce a limited edition (25 copies) of a 30 minute audio cassette recording, accompanied and packaged with a Xerox printed zine and silkscreened print on newsprint. 

One copy of the cassette will be available to listen to in the gallery during the run of the exhibition, on a provided cassette Walkman and earphones. Displayed along with the zine and print. The production of both the sound and visual components will utilise outdated and lo-fi production methods in a celebration of high noise to signal ratio and degraded information.Black Mountain Transmitter will be performing as part of the exhibition.

Li-Li and Hadi Bastani


'Recollection/ Dissolution'Hadi and Li-Li will be presenting a multi-media work: painting / sound installation, that explores the relationship between ‘recorded’ and ‘remembered.’ The idea shaped out of a sketched portrait that they produced in October 2014. The work is a remake of that sketch in the context of its original production time through painting and sound. 'Remembrance is always accompanied by disruptive noises; senses coming from the times that are not necessarily related to a specific memory,' they say. Their memory of that sketch was an amalgamation of different layers of images and sounds. That's why they have used certain techniques to fabricate that fragmented, layered memory in a multi-media work.



Alice Burns
Burns' practice currently explores strategies of public engagement and connections between people and site.  

She explores these relationships through print, installation, video and sound,. Instigated in collaboration with those she encounters.

 'At 22'
'At 22' is a two-part installation consisting of an embossed print and a mechanical Music Box. The composition of the musical work is transcribed directly from the embossing.  
This is a retelling of a non-verbalised past trauma in which layers are added to the memory. The memory remains private, yet is made public.
The musical experience will be unique for each individual as they select which excerpts of the embossing to play.

<p>
</p><p><br/><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>To read more about the fundraiser we held this spring:</p><p>I'm
Lisa Waud and I'm the creator of Flower House. In October 2015, along with the
help from florists friends both local and from across the country, I will
fill the interior walls and ceilings of a 16-room abandoned house with
American-grown fresh flowers and living plants. </p>
<p>Imagine it now: You walk across the crumbling threshold of a house that has been vacant for over a decade, signs of former lives gathered in the windowsills and trapped in the fencing. It overlooks six
busy lanes of I-75 and the whooshing of cars on its one-way highway service
drive street. The second you step inside, the city sounds are muted. Every
surface is lush with color and life. A floral carpet, a wall of foliage, a
ceiling dripping with vines. This disarray and decay was once a home and will blossom again.</p>
<p>Inspired by a long-time fascination with the
installations of Christo and Jeanne-Claude, and moved by images of a 2012 Dior
Show, I purchased two houses on the Hamtramck city auction in October 2014 to
launch the project.</p>
<p>After the floral art installation, our project partners, Reclaim Detroit, will responsibly
deconstruct the houses, diverting as much as 75% of the materials in the
building from the landfill.</p>
<p>When the
structures are gone, we will convert the plot of land into Flower House Farm, a
functional, beautiful flower farm for my floral design business, Pot &amp; Box.</p>
<p>I’ve been in
business as Pot &amp; Box for over 8 years, with one studio in Ann Arbor and
one in Hamtramck. We offer floral design for special events and weddings, as
well as horticultural decor and container garden services for residences and
businesses across Southeast Michigan.</p>
<p><b></b></p><h3><b>WHY?</b></h3><p></p>
Why fill an abandoned house with flowers? <p></p><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1395501/files/20150418205854-pontneuf.jpg?1429415934"" src="""" style=""width: 538.983050847458px; height: 424px;""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">
</p>
<p>I
remember the first time I saw images of Christo and Jeanne-Claude’s wrapped
Pont Neuf bridge in Paris. When i didn’t think “Why?” but instead, “How?”, I
knew something was stirring in me. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1395503/files/20150418205947-dior.jpg?1429415987"" src="""" style=""width: 545.336405529954px; height: 363px;""/></p>
<p>I wouldn’t know until years later, when I poured over images
of the 2012 Dior show installation, exactly what I was going to do. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1395504/files/20150418210009-diormodel.jpg?1429416009"" src="""" style=""width: 316.306172839506px; height: 478px;""/></p>
<p>There was an image from that show that I couldn’t shake; it was an image of
a gorgeous girl, in a gorgeous gown, with a look on her face that couldn’t be described. I
wanted to be there, in those rooms, to know what it felt like, what it smelled
like, what it <i>sounded</i> like. I knew I had to create my own house of flowers and
invite as many people as possible to experience it with me. </p>
<p>As I began talking about my idea, it was surprisingly easy
to get florists on board my vision for the installation. But as the project
evolved, I realized that Flower House is a three-part story. It’s about the flowers, the houses, and the farm.</p>
<p><b>THE FLOWERS</b></p>
<p>The Flower House October installation will be an
unprecedented one. We will experience something that has never been done
before—for one weekend, the walls, ceilings, floors, and fixtures will be
bursting with luscious blooms and textural foliage harvested from American
farms coast to coast, and featuring our own Great Lakes state. There is a real and strong momentum gaining for consciousness in growing, sourcing, and buying flowers grown in our own soil. Much like the Slow Food movement, the Slow Flowers Movement is changing the way people think about where their cut flowers come from in America. To listen my interview about Flower House's commitment to using all American-grown flowers, visit the slowflowers.com link <a href=""http://www.debraprinzing.com/2015/02/18/the-flowering-of-detroit-with-lisa-waud-of-pot-box-episode-181/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. </p>
<p>The house will
be open to the public from Friday, October 16<sup>th</sup> through Sunday,
October 18<sup>th</sup>. This weekend's installation will be a once-in-a-lifetime chance to experience a brief moment of breathtaking beauty in a house that was once abandoned, soon to be torn down, then replaced with a living, growing flower farm. </p>
<p>When the visitors are gone and the flowers have wilted, the materials will be the first to make up the composting system at the future flower farm. While it may seem wasteful to have used them for a brief, artful weekend, the flowers will have been a part of a story being recounted, told, and written. Just like the materials in the structures, the flowers  will live on as something new and beautiful. </p>
<p><b>THE HOUSE</b></p>
<p>As the houses are situated, they are in a unique place. They are not only on a busy service drive along a busy highway, but they are also on the edge of a busy, dense city within a city. Dequindre Street, I-75, Hamtramck, Detroit. What a strangely perfect setting for our Flower House. </p>
<p>The sustainable deconstruction of the two adjacent houses I
bought on foreclosure auction will take place after the October installation.
We’ve partnered with the deconstruction experts at Reclaim Detroit to
responsibly bring down the houses and make way for the future flower farm for
Pot &amp; Box. The goal is to dismantle the structures and divert as much 75%
of the reusable materials out of the landfill. The hope that this deconstruction and land repurposing
will inspire others to see abandoned structures as platforms for art and
business, and to use them in an environmentally responsible way. </p>
<p><b>THE FARM</b></p>
<p>After the floral exhibition and the deconstruction of both
structures, the formerly neglected land will be cultivated into a flower farm.
The new farm will offer locally grown fresh flowers for weddings and events and
host floral design classes in a unique urban setting. Flower House Farm
hopes to inspire others in Detroit to utilize our abundant land for creative
and productive projects, and to create a space that the community can be proud of where there once was danger and blight. </p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: left;""><b>FUNDRAISING</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>When I was first thinking about this project, I assumed that
any fundraising would be for the actual flowers for the installation. But
through incredibly generous floral donations from local wholesalers at Nordlie
and Mayesh and from the California Cut Flower Commission, the focus of the
fundraising has shifted. Please join us to give this house one last hurrah
before Reclaim Detroit brings the houses down, with as many materials as
possible gathered for reuse in the community, and to support this local Detroit
business as it helps to create job opportunities for local people facing
barriers to employment and to create positive social and environmental outcomes
out of the urban waste stream commonly called ""blight"".</p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>PERKS</b></h3>
<p>For your generous donations, we'd love to outfit you with Flower House swag and incredible experiences--an evening at Lisa's studio with the Flower House team, and dinner out in Detroit with the Flower House florists, photographer, and filmmakers.  </p>

<p></p>
<p>We know this is a wonderfully absurd project. Who takes the time and energy to fix up a
decomposing house only to fill it with flowers for a weekend before deconstructing
it and farming the land? I’ll tell you who. Let’s meet the team:</p>

</div></div>","FLOWER HOUSE


Our Indiegogo campaign has ended, but we're continuing our fundraising here. 









To read more about the fundraiser we held this spring:I'm
Lisa Waud and I'm the creator of Flower House. In October 2015, along with the
help from florists friends both local and from across the country, I will
fill the interior walls and ceilings of a 16-room abandoned house with
American-grown fresh flowers and living plants. 
Imagine it now: You walk across the crumbling threshold of a house that has been vacant for over a decade, signs of former lives gathered in the windowsills and trapped in the fencing. It overlooks six
busy lanes of I-75 and the whooshing of cars on its one-way highway service
drive street. The second you step inside, the city sounds are muted. Every
surface is lush with color and life. A floral carpet, a wall of foliage, a
ceiling dripping with vines. This disarray and decay was once a home and will blossom again.
Inspired by a long-time fascination with the
installations of Christo and Jeanne-Claude, and moved by images of a 2012 Dior
Show, I purchased two houses on the Hamtramck city auction in October 2014 to
launch the project.
After the floral art installation, our project partners, Reclaim Detroit, will responsibly
deconstruct the houses, diverting as much as 75% of the materials in the
building from the landfill.
When the
structures are gone, we will convert the plot of land into Flower House Farm, a
functional, beautiful flower farm for my floral design business, Pot & Box.
I’ve been in
business as Pot & Box for over 8 years, with one studio in Ann Arbor and
one in Hamtramck. We offer floral design for special events and weddings, as
well as horticultural decor and container garden services for residences and
businesses across Southeast Michigan.
WHY?
Why fill an abandoned house with flowers? 



I
remember the first time I saw images of Christo and Jeanne-Claude’s wrapped
Pont Neuf bridge in Paris. When i didn’t think “Why?” but instead, “How?”, I
knew something was stirring in me. 

I wouldn’t know until years later, when I poured over images
of the 2012 Dior show installation, exactly what I was going to do. 

There was an image from that show that I couldn’t shake; it was an image of
a gorgeous girl, in a gorgeous gown, with a look on her face that couldn’t be described. I
wanted to be there, in those rooms, to know what it felt like, what it smelled
like, what it sounded like. I knew I had to create my own house of flowers and
invite as many people as possible to experience it with me. 
As I began talking about my idea, it was surprisingly easy
to get florists on board my vision for the installation. But as the project
evolved, I realized that Flower House is a three-part story. It’s about the flowers, the houses, and the farm.
THE FLOWERS
The Flower House October installation will be an
unprecedented one. We will experience something that has never been done
before—for one weekend, the walls, ceilings, floors, and fixtures will be
bursting with luscious blooms and textural foliage harvested from American
farms coast to coast, and featuring our own Great Lakes state. There is a real and strong momentum gaining for consciousness in growing, sourcing, and buying flowers grown in our own soil. Much like the Slow Food movement, the Slow Flowers Movement is changing the way people think about where their cut flowers come from in America. To listen my interview about Flower House's commitment to using all American-grown flowers, visit the slowflowers.com link here. 
The house will
be open to the public from Friday, October 16th through Sunday,
October 18th. This weekend's installation will be a once-in-a-lifetime chance to experience a brief moment of breathtaking beauty in a house that was once abandoned, soon to be torn down, then replaced with a living, growing flower farm. 
When the visitors are gone and the flowers have wilted, the materials will be the first to make up the composting system at the future flower farm. While it may seem wasteful to have used them for a brief, artful weekend, the flowers will have been a part of a story being recounted, told, and written. Just like the materials in the structures, the flowers  will live on as something new and beautiful. 
THE HOUSE
As the houses are situated, they are in a unique place. They are not only on a busy service drive along a busy highway, but they are also on the edge of a busy, dense city within a city. Dequindre Street, I-75, Hamtramck, Detroit. What a strangely perfect setting for our Flower House. 
The sustainable deconstruction of the two adjacent houses I
bought on foreclosure auction will take place after the October installation.
We’ve partnered with the deconstruction experts at Reclaim Detroit to
responsibly bring down the houses and make way for the future flower farm for
Pot & Box. The goal is to dismantle the structures and divert as much 75%
of the reusable materials out of the landfill. The hope that this deconstruction and land repurposing
will inspire others to see abandoned structures as platforms for art and
business, and to use them in an environmentally responsible way. 
THE FARM
After the floral exhibition and the deconstruction of both
structures, the formerly neglected land will be cultivated into a flower farm.
The new farm will offer locally grown fresh flowers for weddings and events and
host floral design classes in a unique urban setting. Flower House Farm
hopes to inspire others in Detroit to utilize our abundant land for creative
and productive projects, and to create a space that the community can be proud of where there once was danger and blight. 

FUNDRAISING



When I was first thinking about this project, I assumed that
any fundraising would be for the actual flowers for the installation. But
through incredibly generous floral donations from local wholesalers at Nordlie
and Mayesh and from the California Cut Flower Commission, the focus of the
fundraising has shifted. Please join us to give this house one last hurrah
before Reclaim Detroit brings the houses down, with as many materials as
possible gathered for reuse in the community, and to support this local Detroit
business as it helps to create job opportunities for local people facing
barriers to employment and to create positive social and environmental outcomes
out of the urban waste stream commonly called ""blight"".

PERKS
For your generous donations, we'd love to outfit you with Flower House swag and incredible experiences--an evening at Lisa's studio with the Flower House team, and dinner out in Detroit with the Flower House florists, photographer, and filmmakers.  


Shown above: Perfume inspired by the installation flowers blended by our friend Monique at Alchemy, a botanical Flower House screenprint by our friend Marcy Davy at All Things Grow, American-sewn tote bags printed by our friends at VG Kids. 
Be sure you check out all the donor perks in the column to the right. 



AMBITION


We know this is a wonderfully absurd project. Who takes the time and energy to fix up a
decomposing house only to fill it with flowers for a weekend before deconstructing
it and farming the land? I’ll tell you who. Let’s meet the team:

this project, I am curating a pop-up exhibition that features six assemblage

art.<br/>
<b><br/>
About </b><br/>
I will execute all aspects of the exhibition including curating, coordinating,
marketing, installing, selling, planning an opening reception, and of course
raising funds. Organizing this project from start to finish will allow me to
utilize the knowledge and skills I have gained while pursuing a Master’s at
SCAD and from my seven years of experience working in arts administration.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Value of Art</b><br/>
The visual arts are important to me, and I am dedicated to pursuing a career in
this field because I believe that viewing fine art energizes and encourages
creativity, discussion, and appreciation of life and one’s surroundings. The
completion of this project will be an important addition to my professional
portfolio, as I will gain the experience I need to open or manage an art
organization in the future.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Why Support?</b><br/>
There will be a number of career benefits not only for me but for the artists
involved. They will receive a great deal of publicity, and they will have the
opportunity to sell their work. Many of them are shipping artwork from out of
state at their own cost, and one of my goals is to help pay for it.<br/>

It’s called Sacramento Art Classes and it’s a beautiful, bright, colorful art studio that I opened a year ago. I’ve been teaching art for over 14 years. One of my first students was my son, Steven, who is shooting this video. Say hi, Steven.</div><div>
<br/>I’ve never asked for crowd funding before, and I’ve never made a video either. But I have taught a lot of art. My students are preschoolers, grade school kids, teens, and adults; just about anyone from age 4 through age 100. I love what I do, and my students tell me I’m good at it. If you’d like to see more of what I do, you can visit my web site at <a href=""http://www.sacramentoartclasses.com."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.sacramentoartclasses.com.</a>
</div><div>
<br/>I decided to try crowd funding because I’ve chosen a career that I love, but it’s not necessarily the most lucrative career choice on the planet – at least not so far – and I need some help making ends meet so that I can continue to keep the Sacramento Art Classes studio open to the public. <br/><br/><p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>I am asking for $14,000 to cover the cost of renting my studio space for 
one year. I’m not asking for the money so that I can just sit back and 
paint daisies all day. I’ll still be working hard to pay for the rest of
 the expenses from my own pocket – art supplies, internet access, phone 
bill, electric bill, daily massages and hot chocolate…..uhhhh, just 
kidding about those last ones.</div><div>
<br/>Seriously, with your funding, I can 
concentrate on teaching the best classes possible and find amazing 
teachers to teach things that I don’t specialize in. At Sacramento Art 
Classes, we offer watercolor, acrylic, oil and ink painting, drawing, 
art journaling, jewelry making, book binding, ornament making, flower 
arranging, card making and craft classes of all kinds for kids and 
adults.<br/><br/>Donation Levels:</div><div>For $1 you get to put a smile on my face.<br/><br/>For $5 you get a big “thank you” on my Facebook page and acknowledgement of your donation.<br/><br/>For $20 you get a personalized thank you note written on one of my greeting cards that you can actually frame and display (I'll need your address, please).</div><div>For $50 you get an original 4” x 4” (or slightly larger) painting made by ME.<br/><br/>For $125 you can have a 2-hour private lesson in watercolor or acrylic painting or you can sponsor this lesson for someone local who cannot afford it.<br/><br/>For $400 you can take any class I offer for FREE or you can sponsor this class for someone local who cannot afford it.<br/><br/>For $1000 you will receive an original 18” x 24” abstract acrylic painting on canvas. You specify color scheme.<br/><br/>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>When you donate the $14K, this beautiful space will be able to stay open for hundreds of people – for kids who want after school drawing lessons and for retirees who want to sketch or collage in the mornings and for and people to come after work and sip a glass of wine while they paint landscapes.<br/><br/>
</div><div>When I raise the $14k, I can keep this studio alive for the 17 other teachers I’ve recruited to teach here. So really, your donations will not only keep Sacramento Art Classes open for a year, they will allow potentially hundreds of others to share in the magic of this studio space as they create amazing things. And imagine if some of those people sell or gift their creations, your donations could potentially spread the gift of art all across Sacramento, or California, or the US, or the WORLD!! Your donations are going far beyond this studio. Your donations are spreading the joy of creating art.<br/><br/>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> If, by some chance, I do not raise $14,000, your 
donations will still be put toward renting the space for Sacramento Art 
Classes (I'm not going to disappear to Aruba). Be assured that I will be doing my best to put this campaign in front of thousands of donors through Facebook and through my e-newsletter. Know that I will keep working to grow my classes, paint better paintings and recruit wonderful teachers so that I can share the gift of art everywhere I go.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p><b>The
House of PainT needs your help! We built an amazing dance floor last year only

<p></p>
<p><b>The
Festival:</b></p>
<p>Over five days each September House of
PainT throws the biggest urban culture jam in the Nation’s Capital –
celebrating and elevating hip hop arts and culture. Attendees of all ages enjoyurban
dance battles, DJ and MC performances, graffiti art, photography, slam poetry

programs emphasize youth engagement and community development through the
creative power of art, run primarily by volunteers. </p>
<p><b>The
History:</b></p>
<p>It
all started in 2003 as a two on two competition celebrating the establishment
of Ottawa’s first legal graffiti wall. The dance floor was small and it was
built by the festival founder and her father, with the sound system borrowed
from a friend. Since then the battle has grown to become one of the most consistent
crew versus crew competitions in Canada and that small dance floor has grown to
become the focal point of the festival. </p>
<p><b>The Heart Break:</b></p>
<p>Last
year the floor reached its ultimate potential and helped to bring the dance action
closer to the audience, with great sight lines, awesome seating, and a wicked
stage! The dancers were most impressed with the floor because we took the time
and care to think about their needs. This included providing a floor that had
the right elements for a Dance Battle: lots of space, just the right amount of
spring, and a big piece of linoleum to help them spin! We even invited the
audience onto the floor at the end of the night, finishing the day off with a
bumpin’ dance party!</p>
<p>After
the festival we put the dance floor in storage for the year – the same storage
we’ve used since 2003. Unfortunately, a violent Canadian winter storm ripped
apart our storage tent and destroyed the best dance floor we’ve ever had. </p>
<p><b>The Need:</b></p>
<p>With
your support we know that we can recreate and surpass the success of last year
– creating a big, beautiful floor and upgrading our storage so we can maintain
it for years to come. As the festival continues to grow, we are committed to
providing the best overall experience for the performers and spectators. Help
us put on an awesome festival by supporting the construction of our dance
floor!</p>

complementa sino que abre nuevos horizontes en el programa del diseño gráfico

design issues and wide-ranging collaboration with cultural institutions and

dissemination of national creators. Consequently, the <b>IPBM </b>is a

University of Mexico, the National Institute of Fine Arts and the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs of Mexico through its General Office for Cooperation Education

ES / La BICM
es el lugar más importante de encuentro y colaboración donde diseñadores del
mundo entero confluyen en su programa de educación y promoción de cultura en
torno al diseño. Este proyecto se ha colocado, no tan sólo en México sino en
los cinco continentes, como una de las iniciativas de mayor relevancia en su
rubro. A diferencia de otras bienales  del
cartel, la BICM se constituyó desde
un principio como un programa académico tanto de educación sobre temas del
diseño de amplio espectro como de colaboración con las instituciones culturales
y de educación superior de México, ambas dedicadas a la formación de
diseñadores y difusión de creadores nacionales. En consecuencia, la BICM es un programa que no tan sólo
complementa sino que abre nuevos horizontes en el programa del diseño gráfico
en México; ésta es la razón debido a la cual en el año de 1988 se invitó a la
Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana, la Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México,
el Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes y la Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores
de México a través de su Dirección General de Cooperación Educativa y Cultural,
como principal convocante, a colaborar con esta iniciativa.

The IPBM is the most important place of
meeting and collaboration where designers from around the world gather in its
program of education and promotion of culture on design. This project has taken
place, not only in Mexico but in the five continents, as one of the most
important initiatives in its field. Unlike other biennials poster, the IPBM
was established from the beginning as both: an academic education program
design issues and wide-ranging collaboration with cultural institutions and
higher education in Mexico, both dedicated to the training of designers and
dissemination of national creators. Consequently, the IPBM is a
program that not only complements but also opens new horizons in the graphic
design program in Mexico; this is the reason because of which in the year 1988
were invited to the Metropolitan Autonomous University, the National Autonomous
University of Mexico, the National Institute of Fine Arts and the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs of Mexico through its General Office for Cooperation Education
and Culture, as the main convener, to cooperate with this initiative.

ES / La prioridad general de la BICM, al igual que hace un cuarto de siglo, es promover la cultura
del diseño como parte de la vida diaria. Esta idea es el eje transmisor de
propuestas creativas y de interés social que procura la estética contemporánea
tanto en las actividades de difusión cultural como publicitarias y de temas
político-sociales; mismas que sin lugar a dudas impactan en la formación de
gusto estético que constituye la cultura visual de un país, ya que la BICM afirma que el diseño gráfico
aplicado a la publicidad, la difusión cultural, la promoción de campañas
sociales y educativas genera un vasto espectro de posibilidades para el
lenguaje visual percibido por millones de personas. La reflexión sobre cultura
y comunicación visual es entonces posible a través de la comprensión de
mensajes.

formation of aesthetic taste that is the visual culture of a country, as

dissemination, promotion of social and educational campaigns generated a vast
spectrum of possibilities for the visual language perceived by millions.
Reflection on visual culture and communication is now possible through the

ES / El diseño
gráfico contemporáneo no ha sido todavía entendido en plenitud como una de las
herramientas más indispensables para el desarrollo sociocultural, de las artes,
de la vida social, política y productiva en general. Por otro lado, el cartel continúa siendo una pieza
indispensable en el desarrollo del oficio del diseñador, lo que obliga a adquirir
conocimientos complejos de composición, códigos de color y tipográficos,
iconografías relacionadas con los temas tratados, conocimiento de la
construcción y arquitectura de la letra además de la necesidad de comunicar una

RECOMPENSAS / REWARDS


ES / ¿Por qué usamos colores en los nombres de las recompensas? “La razón es que la vista, mejor que los otros sentidos, nos da a conocer los objetos, y nos descubre entre ellos gran número de diferencias” decía Aristóteles. En la BICM consideramos que la nutrida gama de colores, aunque cada uno distinguible, se funde y conjunta para crear un panorama armónico del mismo modo que cada individuo, con sus límites que lo diferencian,  une sus horizontes para generar una red que trabaja en conjunto por una sociedad permeada por los más altos valores. 
EN / Why we
use colors in the names of the rewards? ""The reason is that the view
better than the other senses, reveals the objects, and we discover including
many differences,"" said Aristotle. In the IPBM, we believe that the
abundant range of colors, although each distinguishable, is melted and combined
to create a harmonious landscape just as each individual, with limits that
differentiate it, unites its horizons to create a network that works together
permeated by the highest values society.
BICM de plata: 25 años avivando los tonos para perdurar la memoria.
IPBM silver: 25 years stoking tones to endure memory.

Nuestros Bosques Comestibles ,  tienen como objetivo reforestar espacios especialmente degradados o incendiados, revitalizar despoblados, crear auto-empleo, fomentar la Permacultura (Significa Agricultura Permanente. Leer Más). y toda una Red de Alojamientos, Formación y Producciones Artesanales...





Ahora puedes ayudarnos y financiar algún elemento de éste primer Proyecto de Bosque de Alimentos en la provincia de Cádiz (Andalucía- España).  
Dará trabajo y cobijo a  dos familias (en principio) que alcanzarán elevados niveles de Autosuficiencia Alimentaria, Energética y Financiera.
 El ""BOSQUE COMESTIBLE DE LAS SABINAS"" funcionará como vivero para propagar parte de las plantas que nos servirán en futuros proyectos de Bosques Comestibles.







 Después de muchos años de aprendizaje nos hemos decidido a crear una Red con la que poner a disposición de todos, los conocimientos necesarios para caminar hacia la autosuficiencia mediante el trabajo colectivo y la cooperación. 
EJEMPLOS DE OTROS ESPACIOS DENTRO DE BOSQUES COMESTIBLES

         
  


Franjas de infiltración con Bancales Profundos EDP y Bosque Comestible de ""Santa Margarita"".Diseños de Diego Luis López para Sastreria Vegetal.
NUESTROS BLOGS

 Si quieres conocer más sobre nuestros proyectos, te invitamos a visitar los blogs en los que hemos estado trabajando y que de alguna manera complementen la información que vamos publicando:  EL BLOG CON FICHAS DE PLANTAS AROMÁTICAS Y MEDICINALES,  RECETAS DE COCINA EN PERMACULTURA,  REMEDIOS NATURALES, ESPECIES QUE EMPLEAMOS, etc....


 Todo éste trabajo lo Coordinamos desde la oficina de La Casa del Pozo que es además la Casa-Taller en la que procesamos los distintos productos que obtenemos de los huertos y de la RED IBÉRICA DE BOSQUES COMESTIBLES Y SEMILLAS LIBRES en éste nuevo espacio.


Por qué te necesitamos y  Qué obtienes a cambio


En ésta ocasión el terreno es cedido por el Amigo Cristóbal y no es necesario comprarlo por lo que el coste estimado de la preparación, plantación, obras necesarias y su correcto mantenimiento hasta que el Bosque sea autónomo se eleva a un mínimo de 28207 €uros  en los que se incluye además la construcción de un Baño seco, Horno Universal y dos Alojamientos Domo para acoger a Voluntarios y asistentes a Cursos, además de colaboradores y benefactores como tú, que deseen venir a vernos. También hemos incluido un vehículo y remolque ya que los necesitaremos para poder transportar personas, plantas y materiales, cosechas, llevar a cabo rutas por los alrededores, etc... Dado el aislamiento y malas comunicaciones del lugar, muchas veces hemos de recoger a nuestros amigos y visitantes en alguna de las poblaciones cercanas.


                                  






Al colaborar con nosotros, te haces también ""propietaria"" ya que obtienes acceso gratuito a cualquier Bosque de ésta Red y descuentos para los Talleres, Alojamientos y Compra de productos. Financiando una Planta Medicinal, un Arbusto, Caja-Nido o Árbol recibirás un documento que hace las veces de ""recibo"" y que te indica la descripción y posicionamiento GPS del elemento financiado. Presentando dicho documento podrás acceder libremente a visitar cualquier Bosque Comestible de esta Red.

Ayudas igualmente a la preservación de variedades de semillas. Antiguas, locales y libres. Nuestro Banco de Semillas Libres tendrá su instalación principal en éste primer Bosque Comestible y, desde allí se organizarán periódicamente encuentros y contactos para el intercambio de semillas y otras colaboraciones que puedan surgir y cuyo fin sea la preservación de la diversidad genética de las semillas y su libre acceso.

El objetivo primero de esta iniciativa es el de Regenerar Espacios para la Biodiversidad que ofrezcan oportunidades de empleo (a dos familias en éste caso). La Forestación Lógica de cada espacio y la creación de condiciones para la Auto Gestión, serán siempre el destino principal y primero de los fondos recaudados.




Queremos que formes parte!!! y para eso hemos puesto en marcha un Blog de este ""BOSQUE COMESTIBLE DE LAS SABINAS""en el que podrás seguir todo el proceso desde el Proyecto que hemos elaborado hasta la plantación, mantenimiento y transformación, Talleres y Cursos programados, etc...

set up a studio at our new home.  While I make a variety of work out of the studio space, wood-firing has always been my favorite firing technique, because of the uniqueness of the finished pots and the community experience that goes along with the firing process.  <br/><br/>Years before we considering living in Indiana, we had been returning to the area to visit my family and participate in wood-firings with my friends.  It was during these visits we began to dream about leaving our small apartment in Chicago and the jobs that allowed us to live but not save, and form a plan about what we wanted from our lives.  Wood-firing with has acted as a catalyst for growth in my relationship with Anna, as well as the greater ceramics community here in northern Indiana.  We dreamed about eventually having our own wood kiln. Now we are excited to make that dream a reality. <br/> <br/><h3>The Campaign</h3>
<p>Building a kiln is a major project, and first on our list was settling on a design.  As mentioned above, we have been very fortunate to be a part of the wood-firing community in Michiana.  Most of the kilns in our area are traditional anagama-style kilns.  These are the kilns that hooked me on wood-firing and while they remain one of my favorite designs, we wanted to bring something new to the area. <br/></p>
<p>After much debate, we settled on a train design.  While smaller than most other kilns, the train will allow for faster and more frequent firings.  It is our hope that this increase in firing speed and turn-around will encourage more experimenting and testing of clay bodies, slips and glazes, as well as new wadding and loading techniques.  <br/></p>
<p>While I have assisted in the building of a few kilns over the years, this is by far the most ambitious project I have attempted.  As such, I thought it best to ask for some professional assistance.  We are very pleased to have expert kiln builder, Ted Neal,  joining us to lead our project.  I have had the privilege of firing with Ted and we couldn't be happier to have him scheduled to build the train. The final product will look something like this. <br/></p>

<p>Hi, my name is Audra Lambert, and I am the curator of <i>The Subtle Image </i>art exhibition.</p>
<p>This exhibit, slated to open on Nov. 6 at Dejavu Gallery, will introduce bright artistic talent to an expanded audience. I'm so excited to be realizing this exhibit, selecting, arranging and curating these works at this central Midtown gallery space.</p>
<p><i><b>We want you to join us in realizing the dream of 13 artists and 1 curator in creating The Subtle Image at Dejavu Gallery.</b></i></p>
<p>Dejavu Gallery is committed to being a center for artistic talent in New York City. And now, we need your support to ensure that we are able to cover costs to produce the show and to cover costs for the site. Help us realize our dream and support all of our efforts to shine for the City (and the world) to see!</p>

The venue is set.
The artists are ready. 
The only piece that's missing... 
...is you.
Hi, my name is Audra Lambert, and I am the curator of The Subtle Image art exhibition.
This exhibit, slated to open on Nov. 6 at Dejavu Gallery, will introduce bright artistic talent to an expanded audience. I'm so excited to be realizing this exhibit, selecting, arranging and curating these works at this central Midtown gallery space.
We want you to join us in realizing the dream of 13 artists and 1 curator in creating The Subtle Image at Dejavu Gallery.
Dejavu Gallery is committed to being a center for artistic talent in New York City. And now, we need your support to ensure that we are able to cover costs to produce the show and to cover costs for the site. Help us realize our dream and support all of our efforts to shine for the City (and the world) to see!

Be an Art Patron!
How You Support Us & Where We're Headed:

Programming: We want to offer guests of the exhibit new ways of considering art in the gallery, with a curator-led tour and prospective talks with artists and interdisciplinary experts in art, fashion and design. 

Space rental: A centrally located Manhattan gallery, we need assistance to cover the costs of renting out the site for The Subtle Image.


Join us as we work to:

That amount will produce the full scope of the show--ensuring that exhibit is on view for long enough to attract a diverse new audience, through the second week of December.  Reaching the listed goal of $8500 will take us through Thanksgiving, but help us extend through to mid-December by contributing to a total of $15,000 and increase exposure for these dedicated artists!

Lange (1926-1992), author and musician, these colorful paintings (see entire set in Gallery above and on Facebook) portraying the big picture of the Bible story from Genesis to Revelation were originally designed and painted on sixteen  2 foot by 6 foot canvasses by Lorenzo Ghiglieri in the mid-1970s.  They were intended to be put on display and tour the world, presenting the entire plan of salvation in just one hour. Sadly, due to over ambitious plans and poor management, the paintings and all associated materials were confiscated in lieu of unpaid debts.  They were placed in storage, collecting dust now for over 40 years.  The trustees have never been able to raise the money needed to recover the paintings.  We believe that it is way over time for the paintings to be put back into the use for which they were intended -- in a museum, available for all to see.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

standards. I rely on the natural human desire for spirituality and exploring
the unknown to guide my vision and shape my ideas to construct interactive art
that encourages oneness. I find beauty in simplicity and straight lines to
invoke a sense of uneasiness and to challenge what one believes to be safe. I
incorporate steel in my designs for the clean aesthetic it provides – a blank
space, if you will, to be filled with emotions, unrest, and desire.</p>

that serves as a DJ booth; the DJ looks out from the open top of the station.

GBP 250  - You are my angel! A digital thank you postcard, a piece of cake during the exhibition and I will draw a comic for you (either your idea or I can come up with one that will have you in it :)). The comic can be up to 10 pages long if black and white and up to 4 pages in full-colour.

   The Impact In my drawings and illustrations I try to capture the beauty of nature and of imagination. This exhibition will help me share my message with the world and hopefully it will inspire people to slow down and look at the beauty around them, to relax and let their minds wonder.This exhibition will also make me extremely happy. It will help me to make one of my dreams come true and facilitate my development as a creator.
    Risks & Challenges The main risk is that not enough people will learn about this exhibition and thus that I won't have many visitors.
A big challenge for me will be also to organise everything as it is my first exhibition after all.

Iquitos. Hace tres años diseñé y presenté la primera colección del proyecto
“Vistámonos de Iquitos”. Este proyecto busca crear conciencia sobre la
necesidad de proteger, poner en valor y visibilizar el patrimonio
arquitectónico de la ciudad y con él su historia, su gente, su identidad.</p>
<p>Vistámonos de Iquitos nació por la necesidad de tomar posición y
protestar frente al maltrato que sufrió nuestro patrimonio arquitectónico, con
la demolición de la sede de la Municipalidad de Maynas, uno de los edificios
más emblemáticos de la ciudad en el año 2010; y de llamar la atención de la
población sobre la necesidad de identificarse con la ciudad, su historia y su
patrimonio, a fin de protegerlos y visibilizarlos. </p><p> </p>

Iquitos. Hace tres años diseñé y presenté la primera colección del proyecto
“Vistámonos de Iquitos”. Este proyecto busca crear conciencia sobre la
necesidad de proteger, poner en valor y visibilizar el patrimonio
arquitectónico de la ciudad y con él su historia, su gente, su identidad.
Vistámonos de Iquitos nació por la necesidad de tomar posición y
protestar frente al maltrato que sufrió nuestro patrimonio arquitectónico, con
la demolición de la sede de la Municipalidad de Maynas, uno de los edificios
más emblemáticos de la ciudad en el año 2010; y de llamar la atención de la
población sobre la necesidad de identificarse con la ciudad, su historia y su
patrimonio, a fin de protegerlos y visibilizarlos.  
En esta oportunidad les presento:


Este
proyecto está basado en las formas, colores, textura e historias que acompañan
a los azulejos que llegaron desde España y Portugal, durante la época del
caucho.
Lo que hice
fue tomar fotos de cada azulejo y vectorizar cada diseño para que pueda ser
aplicado a la tela u otros materiales para el traje.


Uno de los
costos del esplendor de Iquitos durante este periodo, fue el maltrato, la esclavitud
y el genocidio que sufrieron muchas etnias amazónicas. Para esta muestra se ha
seleccionado la iconografía de Boras y Huitotos, dos pueblos que casi fueron exterminados
por los llamados barones del caucho; para crear un símbolo que represente a

La iconografía seleccionada sirvió para crear
dos nuevos azulejos, los que servirán para reconocer, valorar y respetar el
aporte de estos pueblos en la construcción física de la ciudad, su identidad y
su historia.

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Exploring sex work through object biographies, <i>Objects of Desire </i>provides an alternative narration of being a sex worker to the binary of exploitation versus empowerment that often dominates popular discourse around sex work.</b></span></p>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Through a series of workshops and events, the exhibition will invite discussion around the ways in which both sex and labor are perceived, understood and moralised in the UK today.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">This exhibition comes at a time of vital need to broaden conversations about sex work away from abstractions and one dimensional stereotypes. As sex worker organizations worldwide continue fighting for decriminalization as the best model to secure their rights and better working conditions, they have been endorsed by human rights groups such as Amnesty International. However, debates around legislation often exclude sex workers voices. The 'Nordic Model' of criminalising clients, which was recently adopted in France, is being considered by a parliamentary inquiry in the UK, despite a growing body of evidence that it endangers sex workers and increases stigma.  </span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Amidst this context of political and legal contention, </span><i style=""background-color: initial;"">Objects of Desire</i><span style=""background-color: initial;""> takes the practice and everyday experience of sex work as a starting point for opening an alternative conversation on sex work. It is not merely an attempt to “humanize” sex workers through providing outsiders with a glimpse into their lives. Rather, sex workers’ stories about materiality and exchange challenge the wider public to reflect upon dynamics of gendered labor, complex hierarchies of power and care under capitalism, and the interplay of the emotional and material in all relationships.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Following an open call for objects from sex workers, </span><i style=""background-color: initial;"">Objects of Desire</i><span style=""background-color: initial;""> has collected gifts such as jam, The New Testament, an endoscopic camera, shiny leggings and a Blue Balls Fucking Machine (BBFM). </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Further to gifts, personal totems, such as a necklace, have been included. The necklace, which was bought for the first day of work, holds much significance to the owner despite their own description of it as ‘cheap and plastic’. The objects range from the erotic to the banal, however their biographies illuminate the ways in which the relations of sex work play out, are managed and sometimes surprise.</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/>As Rori says about the Assorted M&amp;S, Fortnum &amp; Mason and Tesco jams and preserves she was given by a client…</p>
<blockquote>“I’ve wondered why he always gives me preserves. I can see that he gets a lot of pleasure from giving me food and feeling that he is caring for me... But I’ve also noticed that he is very into bodily fluids and often says how nice it is that we “taste” each other. I wonder if the jars of sticky jam are a symbolic substance, a kind of proxy for bodily fluids... If me storing them in my cupboard and ingesting them is a way for him to transcend the boundaries of our sessions, inserting himself somehow into my home and body.”</blockquote>

The fundraising
We are hoping to raise money which will aid us in starting up the archive, putting on a great exhibition, organising workshops for sex workers and allies and continuing the project further. To break it down, we have written a list of some of the tasks involved in each step which will cost us:
Starting the archive


Postage for objects being sent from outside the UK

Making a website (hosting, domain, design and build)

The exhibition


Hire of venue


Printing of photographs

Printing of artworks
Getting objects and artworks in and out of the space (hiring a van)
Hanging photographs and artworks
Compensating artists, invigilators and helpers (with lunch if not a fee)
Decoration of the space (wallpaper or paint, fun glitzy stuff, furniture)
Private view (alcohol, DJs)
Second week party selling zines from workshops (as above)

The workshops

Paying speakers (for discussion workshops)
Providing materials (for art / craft workshops)
Printing zines / other artworks made in workshops

Continuing the project

Travelling to collect and photograph more objects
Taking the exhibition elsewhere

Luckily we have some great friends and contacts and have managed to get a lot of the things listed above (the designing and building of the website, for example) quoted at a much lower cost than anticipated. In the future, we aim to apply for funding for the project and it is often required to show that we have been running a functioning project and already have a portion of the money that we're asking for. We would like to be able to continue putting on exhibitions and pay artists and contributors in the future.

<p>Artist Statement<br/><i>Escribiendome explores the ways in which words and languages shape our sense of self and how, in turn, through our life experiences we blur, transgress and shape the meanings of the words that are used to define and categorize us. It consists of two video channels played in one split screen. In one video you see my hand writing words in English such as friend, artist, designer, student, Mexican, Canadian, migrant, landed immigrant, Latin, woman, minority, citizen, spouse, alien, mother, (…). In the other video you see my hand writing words in Spanish such as hija (daughter), sobrina (niece), nieta (granddaughter), prima (cousin), mujer (woman), comadre, amiga (friend), tapatía, (…). Through the repeated action of writing at some point in the video the words become illegible.</i></p>

<p>Gabriela Aceves Sepúlveda is an interdisciplinary media artist and cultural historian with a research focus on Latin American feminist media arts.

<p>As with all large infrastructure projects, however, there is
always the possibility of unavoidable delays and cost overruns. For this reason

<p>VIVO Media Arts Centre is one of Canada’s leading
artist-run centres dedicated to the exploration, creation, and dissemination of
media arts. VIVO is
dedicated to creating a vibrant community of media artists through innovative
programs and opportunities, and inspiring artistic development by being a space
for incubation and creative exchange. We value risk-taking and radical
paradigms and encourage, facilitate and inspire artists to take on challenges
beyond those taken up through established art forms. We distinguish
ourselves by bridging the gap between the hacker, DIY, and maker communities
and experimental practice and critical art theory. We engage the broader community in dialogue, new art
experiences, and hands-on learning.</p>
<p>VIVO directly supports
artists and independent community-based producers to develop, exchange, and
disseminate their skills in a supportive environment through accessible
services and programs.  We achieve our
mandate by providing:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>The material
necessities for quality production at affordable rates: production equipment,
media post-production facilities, studio and exhibition space. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>A broad range of skills
development and education opportunities that allow for the exploration of, and
experimentation with, technology within a critical, artistic framework. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>The extensive resources of our Archive, rigorous research
opportunities, dissemination and creative projects. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Support of the
aspirations and livelihood of artists through our international distribution
services (Video Out), work exchange program, employment in our contemporary
exhibition program as artists, curators, lecturers, writers, and technicians,
and, as staff at VIVO.</p>
<p><b>Facilities</b></p>
<p>Our leased facility at 1965 Main Street in Vancouver was sold in 2013. In August 2014, VIVO relocated to 2625 Kaslo Street in the Collingwood-Renfrew area and holds a 10 year lease with the City of Vancouver. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><p></p></div>","We’re undertaking some major renos to turn our
space at 2625 Kaslo Street into every media artist’s dream facilities equipped
with gear we know you’ll be drooling over! 
More than that, we’re giving
our space a serious makeover to accommodate the needs of arts and community
organizations that require a flexible venue to present their events in a
professional yet accessible setting. 


   It's time for more than a paint job 


We
love our new space, but it needs more than a coat of paint to meet the needs of
media artists in the short and long term. Designer Scott Cohen has been working
with VIVO to design a flexible space with improved and new facilities for the production, exhibition, education, and conservation of media art.



Meet the new VIVO. This is what we've got planned:



The good news is, we’ve secured the nuts and bolts funding and our Operation Yellow Helmet is in full gear. But we need your help to make sure that our dream plan for VIVO gets realized. 
We're going for a full on makeover!
Here’s what we can accomplish with your help:



PERMANENT!  Wheelchair access. (we’re going legit on this one, CoV get
     your stamp of approval ready!)



NEW!  Co-working space. A rare
     resource in the under-served communities of Grandview-Woodlands and Renfrew-Collingwood.





NEW!  Kitchen facilities. Finally, you can work or
     volunteer at VIVO and not have to eat doughnuts and McDonalds (unless you
     want to). Imagine the possibilities!




IMPROVED!
Exhibition/Studio Space



Control Booth. Choose between a
      raised, discrete control booth  or accessible floor access.

New
      projectors (we
      know we don’t have to sell you on that one)

More
      projection surfaces (to make use of our new projectors
      of course!)

New staff entrance for concession area for quick kitchen access




And there's more!


MORE! Space for the Crista Dahl Media Library & Archive



Over 500 sq ft of newly-acquired climate-controlled, secured,
video storage (‘cause after all, we do run the largest independent media arts
archive in Western Canada!)


Private print archive with research and scanning
area.


NEW!  Classroom/Workshop Space. 400+ sq ft
dedicated classroom with a 4K flat panel screen.


MORE! Space for the Digitization
Hub. The better to access all that rad vintage video gear we use to digitize
your work.

NEW!
Production Studio/Micro-Cinema.  For the first time at VIVO - a flex space that includes
a 7.1 surround sound system; iPad Air 2; Mac Mini; Audio Interface; Projector
and motorized screen.



If our plan doesn’t restore your faith in Vancouver having the potential to present some truly experimental and radical media work we don’t know what will!  





If you're a MEDIA ARTIST:


new facilities and better technology


If you’re a
cultural or COMMUNITY GROUP:


a quality, accessible, affordable venue

If you're a CONTEMPORARY ART LOVER:

Some of the most diverse programming in the city—from solo exhibitions to high-profile festivals—and access to 45 years of international media art.











If you're just INCREDIBLY GENEROUS:

Great perks
AND knowing that you’ve supported local culture and our media artists.

Whose
going to benefit from this new space?


EVERYONE!
Yes, our members, artists-in-residence,
volunteers, exhibited artists, distributed artists, and artists represented in
our archive will all be better served by our renovations. But VIVO serves many
more people than that! 
VIVO is a public venue. Our exhibition,
educational and archive programs and services are open to everyone!  You just save more money on our classes if you become a member (sounds like a good idea, right?).
Small screenings and archive screenings are possible in the
intimate setting of our Micro-Cinema. VIVO’s  Presentation/Production Studio will be available for short-term or
large-scale production and accessible to members and community partners alike. And,
of course, VIVO, individual artists, cultural and community groups will
continue to host extraordinary public exhibitions in our Presentation space throughout the year.
Our Archive Collections remain accessible to everyone. Our expanded Digitization Hub allow us to more efficiently digitize your videos and continue to make our
archival collection to you and international audiences.
Bottom line: it’s not about us, it’s about
you - the media arts community and the community at large - benefiting from a
one-of-a-kind, flexible, affordable and accessible venue. 

This will give you some idea of the numbers of people and types of organizations that benefit from a venue like VIVO -
We've worked with an amazing number of artists, presented a ton of public activities and welcomed a mob of media arts enthusiasts. Here's our yearly average for the last 5 years:



We're always up to partnering with new like-minded organizations and, over the years, we've had the opportunity to collaborate with amazing groups of people. In 2015 alone, we’ve partnered with
the following organizations to co-present events in our space: 



We can't wait to see what you're going to create and present in our new space!

We know you love VIVO and VIVO loves you back! To thank you for your generous support our construction crew has crafted some special rewards. There's something to please everyone and every wallet, whether you're a music lover, yoga enthusiast, or old-timer with a collection of Umatic tapes collecting dust. Here's your chance to get your hands on some sweet tickets to Destroy Vancouver or Queer Arts Festival or a BlackFlash subscription; access  our workshops at a reduced price; double your investment in Video Bucks; purchase some serious art; attend exclusive events; put on your own event in our space, or become the proud owner of a custom-made Banana Theremin! 
Every contribution will get you a special ""thank you"" GO!GO! GIF(t)! All perks valued at $25 and up include an invite to our exclusive donor party, a voucher for you to enjoy a beverage on us next time you visit, and a VIVO tote bag!








It's hard to imagine anything more fun or inspiring than spending a few hours with the marvelous Margaret Dragu!  Margaret will guide the group through a Yoga class, frugal cooking class, Verb Frau wisdom, videos AND dinner with the artist. A truly original hands-on, hands-in-the-air, perk!
  SATURDAY JUNE 18 | 5PM @ VIVO
Margaret Dragu is a writer and artist who has worked in the genres of performance art, video and film, installation, and choreography. She was awarded the 2012  Governor-General’s Award for Visual Art and Media; is the recipient of City of Richmond’s Most Innovative Artist Award, Ethel Tibbett’s Woman of the Year Award for The Arts, Richmond Women’s Centre’s Inspirational Woman Award, & the Mall Peepre Award for Outstanding Fitness Leader. 








One of the great things about being an artist-run centre is having talented artists on our board. Three of them have generously offered their artworks as perks in our campaign. 
Gabriela Aceves Sepúlveda | Escribiendome






Size: 13"" x 19""Medium: Digital print on photographic paperDate: 2011-2013
Artist StatementEscribiendome explores the ways in which words and languages shape our sense of self and how, in turn, through our life experiences we blur, transgress and shape the meanings of the words that are used to define and categorize us. It consists of two video channels played in one split screen. In one video you see my hand writing words in English such as friend, artist, designer, student, Mexican, Canadian, migrant, landed immigrant, Latin, woman, minority, citizen, spouse, alien, mother, (…). In the other video you see my hand writing words in Spanish such as hija (daughter), sobrina (niece), nieta (granddaughter), prima (cousin), mujer (woman), comadre, amiga (friend), tapatía, (…). Through the repeated action of writing at some point in the video the words become illegible.


Gabriela Aceves Sepúlveda is an interdisciplinary media artist and cultural historian with a research focus on Latin American feminist media arts. Working at the intersections of video and performance, she uses video and multimedia installations to explore the social, political, and cultural structures that shape our sense of self.  She is assistant professor at the School of Interactive Arts and Technology at Simon Fraser University,  and a member of the Vancouver-based AKA collective.  

Matilda Aslizadeh | Deities (VIVO Edition)

Size: 10”X 10”Medium: Lightjet printDate: 2016
Artist StatementDeities is one of a  series of photographic and video works that explore the destruction and creation of artifacts in light of nostalgia, iconoclasm and notions of cultural authenticity.


Matilda Aslizadeh is a visual artist who works in a hybrid style between video, photography and animation and has a persisting interest in (re) thinking narrative structures.  Her work has been exhibited internationally in galleries and film festivals, most recently at Art Souterrain (Montreal) and the Kitchener-Waterloo Art Gallery (Kitchener).  Matilda teaches courses in photography, video production, critical theory and digital media at Emily Carr University of Art and Design and Kwantlen Polytechnic University.
Mariane Bourcheix-Laporte | I Would Like To Revolutionize But I Am Stuck With Reform


 Size: 12”X 12” diptych (unframed)                                                                                                   Medium: Gouache on paper                                                                                                      Date: 2014/2016


Artist StatementI Would Like to Revolutionize But I Am Stuck With Reform 
is part of the ongoing series of print, performance
and installation-based works that examines the tensions existing between one’s
revolutionary dreams and the realities of the politico-institutional
instruments governing social life. The work appropriates a quote from Lucy Lippard and its form plays with the of performativity of activist referents.   



Mariane Bourcheix-Laporte
is an interdisciplinary artist and independent curator based in Vancouver. She
completed an MFA in Interdisciplinary Studies at Simon Fraser University. Her
artistic and curatorial projects have been shown throughout Canada and, more
recently, internationally. Recent exhibitions and performances include: Coalesce Performance

Audain Gallery (Vancouver, 2015); Deformes Performance Biennale (Valdivia,
Chile, 2014); Intersite Festival (Calgary, 2014); Langague/Language (Arprim, Montréal, 2014). Recent curatorial projects
include: Acts of Spatial Decolonization,
Decoy and Balcone (Vancouver, 2015); Glissements de terrains, Capture Photography Festival (Vancouver,

Esse: art & opinions and C Magazine and recently published the
artists’ book Tracts through
Publication Studio Vancouver. 



We asked Sean Michaels -  thereminist, ""Said the Gramophone"" founder, and winner of the Giller Prize for his fictional novel about Leon Theremin - ""Us Conductors"" -  to conceptualize a theremin for us.  The result is a surreal instrument crafted by Vancouver artist Jaeden Chayce Leimert, working in concert with Michaels to realize his concept.

Other Ways You Can Help

 Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about your campaign. Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!   And that's all there is to it.Risks and Challenges

At the time of this campaign’s launch we have  85% of our
funding confirmed.  We gratefully
acknowledge the financial support of the City of Vancouver, Heritage Canada, the Canada Council,
SVES’ Inner Circle members, Frans Van De Ven,  and all the other individual donors to our infrastructure
project.  
We have created a budget-conscious yet impactful plan for
this renovation. As outlined, it will radically transform our space adding
greater accessibility and flexibility in use for VIVO, our members and the
community. 
As with all large infrastructure projects, however, there is
always the possibility of unavoidable delays and cost overruns. For this reason
we cannot guarantee that the entire project will be completed before the end of
2016. The exact results will is dependent to some degree on the success of securing
the final 15% of funding,
including the amount represented by this crowdfunding campaign.  

All perks are secured and guaranteed. Perks available May 15th. Details will be emailed to you. Who We Are

artists and independent community-based producers to develop, exchange, and
disseminate their skills in a supportive environment through accessible
services and programs.  We achieve our
mandate by providing:
· 
The material
necessities for quality production at affordable rates: production equipment,
media post-production facilities, studio and exhibition space. 
· 
A broad range of skills
development and education opportunities that allow for the exploration of, and
experimentation with, technology within a critical, artistic framework. 
· 
The extensive resources of our Archive, rigorous research
opportunities, dissemination and creative projects. 
· 
Support of the
aspirations and livelihood of artists through our international distribution
services (Video Out), work exchange program, employment in our contemporary
exhibition program as artists, curators, lecturers, writers, and technicians,
and, as staff at VIVO.
Facilities

</h3> <p>When I was a child, my grandmother taught me to sew using dental floss and a few paper napkins. Over the past twenty-some years, I've refined my materials and technique. Now I'm an adult who has a lot of free time due to a spinal compression and resulting neuritis. As long as I have all this time on my hands, I want to use it to bring lovely things into other people's lives.

However, I prefer to charge patrons only as much as is fair: for the supplies (needle, fabric, embroidery floss) and time needed to complete their ideas. Simpler designs, like slogans or basic cross-stitch, cost less; more elaborate ideas, like pieces of art or portraiture, will naturally cost a little more.</p>
<p>As much as possible, I prefer to work freehand instead of relying on patterns, so each patron can rest assured they're ordering something special. This also means I can work off photographs and with abstract ideas. If you need an embroidered velvet portrait of Black Jesus riding a neon unicorn, just ask.  </p>
<p>This fundraiser is meant as a platform on which to build my future work.

<div>If you choose to support this campaign by contracting me for a work of embroidery, you will receive something that was made by hand by a dedicated craftsperson and is unique by virtue of its concept as well as its workwomanship (see above).</div>
<div>You will also help me to do something special for a woman who's been through some things. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">My mom is a resilient lady who has been a proud lifelong member of the working class, struggles with some health issues of her own, and still shows up every day in her current job as an educator.

As noted above,  I base my rates on supplies (needle, fabric, embroidery floss) and time needed to complete an idea. Simpler designs, like slogans or basic cross-stitch, cost less; more elaborate ideas, like pieces of art or portraiture, will naturally cost a little more. <br/>After donating, I will email you to get a thorough idea of your concept -- you can have some photos ready to communicate your vision, but we can almost certainly talk it out if you can't find any. <br/>During the creative process I'll send periodic updates to let you see how things are working out. That way, you can see progress and have a hand in shaping it yourself.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>How Can I Help?</h3> <p>If you would like to help, but can't contribute, that's okay! Maybe you know someone who is trying to find the perfect special gift for someone, or wants just the right thing to put in just a certain spot in their home, and would like to purchase a work of embroidery for that exact purpose. If you don't mind linking to this campaign on social media, it would bridge the gap between that person and me.<br/>If anyone would like to donate, but for some reason does not want a work of embroidery in return, that's also acceptable ...  although admittedly confusing. Please let me send you a postcard or something!</p>

During the creative process I'll send periodic updates to let you see how things are working out. That way, you can see progress and have a hand in shaping it yourself.
    How Can I Help? If you would like to help, but can't contribute, that's okay! Maybe you know someone who is trying to find the perfect special gift for someone, or wants just the right thing to put in just a certain spot in their home, and would like to purchase a work of embroidery for that exact purpose. If you don't mind linking to this campaign on social media, it would bridge the gap between that person and me.If anyone would like to donate, but for some reason does not want a work of embroidery in return, that's also acceptable ...  although admittedly confusing. Please let me send you a postcard or something!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<p><span>Queen Things</span><span> was developed from a need for women to uplift, collaborate, learn from and inspire one another. In DC, Maryland, and Virginia, there are so many talented and exceptional female entrepreneurs, creatives, advocates, and philanthropists. The goal of this project is to, not only highlight these remarkable women but to call us together to work with one another and plant the seeds that will foster that same spirit in the generations of ambitions girls to come.</span></p>

<p><b>Queen Things </b>is a mindset to remind yourself daily, not necessarily that you are ""royalty,"" but that you should uphold yourself to those standards. You should lift your head up high every day as to not drop your ""invisible crown"" and be the best example of a human being as you can be to those in your reach. We are here not to merely exist, but to live purposely. Personally, I am most inspired when I see other woman taking on challenges, problem solving and advocating for those who may not be able to do so on their own. It makes me want to do more. This past year, I've been brainstorming ways in which I can make my art bigger than myself and reach those around me. Life is too short not to connect and lift up one another.I want to bring us together so we can and give 6 exceptional women their flowers while they're still here. The only way I know to do that is through the gift of art. I've been successfully painting portraits and commissioned work for 6 years, and I'm very excited to do this for the selected and deserving woman chosen from the nominations. I am taking nominations starting now at <a href=""http://www.jnelljordan.com/queenthings."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.jnelljordan.com/queenthings</a> as well as getting together local female entrepreneurs and organizations to make this three day event a success.</p>

As there were ten characters portrayed, the obvious thing to do was to find two more and MAKE A CALENDAR, BABY!</p>
<p></p>
<h3>The True Story</h3>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">What actually happened is that our photographer, Shane Gagnon, bought a cheesy princess costume for a possible shoot.  He was advised to NEVER BUY A CHEESY COSTUME AGAIN. As I was explaining the merits of a truly fabulous corset, it occurred to both of us that we actually had the concept for something really FUN. Why not do princess pinups? </span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450390568/mf8pxqtevnixvg6qdif6.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p>Whilst roaming the kingdom searching for the RIGHT princesses, we realized that the girls we wanted to work with were incredibly strong and independent women, not professional models, often pierced and/or tattooed... and we thought that they might not be into it... because... pink and fluffy. But they LOVED the idea! They all seemed to have an inner heroine that they connected with and had ""always wanted to dress up as"". After months of creating the costumes and sets and organizing cupcakes and pseudo-wolves, we were ready. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>So... Pinup then?</h3>Welll... we both love pinup but also we both love cosplay. Really what we decided to do is to combine them. Pinup is usually much simpler and much more vintage inspired. This is completely fantasy... BUT with a definite vibe of authenticity. It was very important to us... MOST important... to not re-create certain characters from... a certain large-ish company that may or may not start with D. So we went back to the core of the <i>original</i> stories, looked up the historical references, and created our own translation. Sure, Pocahontas wouldn't have worn <i>metallic</i> tattoos, but she would have been tattooed or painted and she DID look pretty much like this... <p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450581968/hkzvdtbrwcgqjr61ef9f.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>...except, you know, less manicured. And Tara IS of First People's heritage so it was very important to us that she feel both connected and happy with her character. Each girl is very connected to their portrayals and I think that lends the final product a level of authenticity. They aren't simply cute photos.  The root of cosplay is making a character your own, so we did this by applying a level of pinup fantasy to our historical research. In a word... it's ""Authentically unique."" </p>
<p>OK... two words. </p>

OK, well Once Upon A Time in a small hamlet quite close actually... a photographer and his trusty  Creative Director slash HMUA slash Fancy Sewing Things Master embarked on a fun little project that took on a life of its own and resulted in multiple photos that were too lovely not to turn into something special. As there were ten characters portrayed, the obvious thing to do was to find two more and MAKE A CALENDAR, BABY!

The True Story
What actually happened is that our photographer, Shane Gagnon, bought a cheesy princess costume for a possible shoot.  He was advised to NEVER BUY A CHEESY COSTUME AGAIN. As I was explaining the merits of a truly fabulous corset, it occurred to both of us that we actually had the concept for something really FUN. Why not do princess pinups? 



Whilst roaming the kingdom searching for the RIGHT princesses, we realized that the girls we wanted to work with were incredibly strong and independent women, not professional models, often pierced and/or tattooed... and we thought that they might not be into it... because... pink and fluffy. But they LOVED the idea! They all seemed to have an inner heroine that they connected with and had ""always wanted to dress up as"". After months of creating the costumes and sets and organizing cupcakes and pseudo-wolves, we were ready. 

So... Pinup then?Welll... we both love pinup but also we both love cosplay. Really what we decided to do is to combine them. Pinup is usually much simpler and much more vintage inspired. This is completely fantasy... BUT with a definite vibe of authenticity. It was very important to us... MOST important... to not re-create certain characters from... a certain large-ish company that may or may not start with D. So we went back to the core of the original stories, looked up the historical references, and created our own translation. Sure, Pocahontas wouldn't have worn metallic tattoos, but she would have been tattooed or painted and she DID look pretty much like this... 

...except, you know, less manicured. And Tara IS of First People's heritage so it was very important to us that she feel both connected and happy with her character. Each girl is very connected to their portrayals and I think that lends the final product a level of authenticity. They aren't simply cute photos.  The root of cosplay is making a character your own, so we did this by applying a level of pinup fantasy to our historical research. In a word... it's ""Authentically unique."" 
OK... two words.

<p>Three years, a short book, a zine series and one masters thesis later, See Feel Create has evolved into a flourishing international project, engaging youth and adults from Chiang Mai to Bangkok, the UK, and across NYC. Between collaborations with public schools, local nonprofits, studios, galleries and dedicated community artists, hundreds of youth and adults have taken part in See Feel Create's projects and programs. Teaching environmental, social and personal mindfulness through innovative visual arts curricula, See Feel Create guides participants through the development of visual work with both personal and public significance. </p>

 winter at Studio Kura: a gallery and art workshop center in Fukoka, 
Japan. I will be using the residency to explore and create around the 
concept of wabi sabi alongside Japanese artists and students, and will use the resulting bodies of visual work to develop the international expressive art workshop mentioned above. 


WHAT IS SEE FEEL CREATE?


See Feel Create began in 2012 as an international expressive art workshop series in Chiang Rai, Thailand. The program initially focused on the development of a culturally sensitive workshop series for at risk youth at THE SOLD PROJECT, teaching visual art as a tool for emotional expression. 
Three years, a short book, a zine series and one masters thesis later, See Feel Create has evolved into a flourishing international project, engaging youth and adults from Chiang Mai to Bangkok, the UK, and across NYC. Between collaborations with public schools, local nonprofits, studios, galleries and dedicated community artists, hundreds of youth and adults have taken part in See Feel Create's projects and programs. Teaching environmental, social and personal mindfulness through innovative visual arts curricula, See Feel Create guides participants through the development of visual work with both personal and public significance. 
A LITTLE ABOUT ZOEY:

 



  Zoey Hart is a Brooklyn-based teaching and practicing artist working primarily in multimedia collage and collaborative social practice. Since completing her interdisciplinary MA program at NYU Gallatin, Zoey has lived, traveled, and worked with students from a kaleidoscopic range of cultures and social backgrounds, teaching elements of visual expression to ignite social change. Back in Brooklyn, Zoey works with communities of young artists and thinkers to forge experiential art collaborations. 
Hart's visual work explores the aesthetics of organic imperfection through printmaking, artifact collection and multimedia collage. Inspired by the unfolding adventures of her own chronic autoimmune ailments, Hart seeks to merge internal and external realities through the depiction and distortion of biological and environmental landscapes.
  THE FINANCIAL SCOOP: Here's a break-down of how your donations will support this project
$2,500--- Cost of transportation, materials and residency fee for Studio Kura 
$1,000--- Coordination with NYC schools, nonprofits and artist communities to          promote workshops, host SFC Wabi Sabi workshops
$1,000---Cost of running a 3 part workshop series with artist or youth community in Brooklyn (includes teaching artist fees, transportation, materials)
$500-- Cost of producing publication of SFC: Wabi Sabi documenting works produced by workshop students and collaborators. 
***If fundraising goal is not reached, all funds raised will go towards continued SFC locally-based programming.

These books cover the part of the story where Odysseus begins his journey back, after a long period of waiting on Calypsos island Ogygia, by traveling through many dangers to the welcoming land of civilized  Phaeacia. In Book 6 and 7 he will meet the Phaeacian court and Nausicaa the Phaeacian princess. In book 8, after the Phaeacians have agreed to send him home, there is a great Banquet and, roused by the tales of the great Phaeacean Bard Demodocus, Odysseus begins to tell his own story. This story comprises most of the Odyssey we remember, sirens, Cyclops etc. This will take place in books 9-12. My plan for this part is to seek out accomplished and inspired actors to be my co-narrators.  To bring this phase and the rest of the Odyssey to life I need to showcase the full potential of this project and format.</p><p>         By donating now you will help build a show that both fully expresses vision I have for this project and testifies to the future potential of this project. Ultimately the hope is that I will be able to create a complete Odyssey- the goal is in 2018- using multiple narrators, numerous artist contributions and featuring space for academic and creative discussion.</p><p>Meantime, the current project- set for January- would its be an exciting and groundbreaking show- a major culmination and end in itself, many people have adapted the Odyssey and continue to do so but this- book by book- the complete text from memory but with other elements as well- is, I believe, essentially unique. Your contributions will allow me to bring in and properly compensate my collaborators, musicians, artists and planners and secure locations that will shape, inform and elevate the performances. </p><p>I hope that you will join the campaign and help make this possible and share it with others and encourage them to join as well. I am very excited by the structure of rewards I have created I think there is something at every level. I am particularly pleased with the midlevel rewards- like the podcasts- which will feature a fifth secret book, the season pass and the possibility of commissioning a book- the possibility that someone (or a group of you) might ask me to learn a new book and so shape the larger project is very exciting to me. </p><p>Regardless of how you donate, by doing so, you will be shaping not only this performance but the potential of the entire project. By helping to make this January performance all that it can be you will give me strength and confidence to continue and show collaborators, potential collaborators and potential donors what this project can be.

We can not use plexiglass or acrylic sheeting as the static electricity will draw pastel dust to itself.  The glass should not touch the pastel.<br/>3)  All mats used on pastels should be acid-free and cut with reverse bevels; the latter prevents pastel dust from showing on the beveled edges. The mat helps to lift the glass above the pastel.<br/>4) I will have the work in a excellent  spacious gallery where this group exhibit will be on view until April.

You are welcome to visit the opening evening of the exhibition and following events during it (poetry evenings, artists talks, workshops, etc.)


Why do we ask YOUR help?
Because we don't ask artists for contribution to be exhibited, we are looking for support from outside, from people who appreciate art and want to support it. 
We need money for: rent location, delivery of artworks, hanging artworks, thanks  volunteers, organise few events (opening evening, poetry evening, performances, lectures, workshops, etc.), musicians, food & drinks, PR and invitations, printing, designing.
As every event, which is organised with love for people, we would like to provide best Opening Evening of the exhibition for our guests and participating artists. For this we want to invite performers, musicians, provide specific food & drinks suitable for this type of artistic event. So if we have enough budget, all those goals can be achieved!

What do you get?
Depends on the amount of love you are willing to help us with, you will get form us:

Free entry to all events which we organise during exhibition
Gift card
Invitation to the art dinner
Artwork (1 of 4 by your choice)
Pleasure from visiting the exhibition which you helped to make it happen. This we promise 200%!

<h3>2017 Birds Nest Calendar</h3>
<p>My name is Julianna and I draw scenes from nature for calendars each year. I began this tradition three years ago after I moved across the country to the Pacific Northwest and wanted to have something to send back home to family and friends at the holidays. My calendars are reminders to notice the intricate details of the world we live in and to daily make the choice to step outside of stress and focus on beauty and wonder. I find scientific nomenclature both beautiful and fascinating so I also add the scientific names of what I draw to each sketch. Field guides have been a significant influence on both my artistic and scientific development and I enjoy the idea of this calendar being both beautiful and instructive, similar to the field guides I grew up reading.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This is an opportunity to support Julianna as she takes a step of faith into this new venture.  For this special project we need to raise enough funds to cover the costs of printing the calendars and of course support the artist! </p>
<ul>
<li>Each month will feature a lovingly hand-drawn study of the nest of a different species.  This calendar is the perfect size to have near your computer or on the counter.</li>
<li>It is expected to be about 4 by 6 inches and will hopefully be ready for shipping towards mid-January.  (If this is successful, we promise to start early enough next year for you to even use them for Christmas gifts!)</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As an artist, Julianna enjoys bringing the diversity she finds in creation to life through her drawings.  This collection of bird nests is no exception - you will enjoy marveling at the diverse construction methods used by each species throughout the new year!  This calendar is an exciting way to both support her new venture and get to enjoy her lovely handiwork throughout the new year!</p>
<p>Even if you have a calendar for 2017 already, think of all the other places where you would enjoy using a small calendar with beautiful artwork!  Please help us get the word out on this campaign and help us support Julianna's new venture!</p>

Zidane en est une.  J´avais d´ailleurs commencé à travailler sur une ébauche de sa statufication en 2006 mais je n´avais pas trouvé le soutien financier nécessaire à son aboutissement. On m´avait expliqué que plus personne ne voudrait d´une statue de Zidane après son mauvais geste lors de la finale du « Mondial 2006 ».</p><p>Tel un impératif catégorique, j´éprouve depuis quelques années la nécessité sculpturale d´opposer une autre vision, un « pendant » à la statufication strictement négative qui existe de Zidane. Cette dernière qui a pour titre « Coup de boule » est l´œuvre d´un artiste au parcours exceptionnel et qui se trouve être un de mes condisciples de l´école des Beaux-Arts d´Alger entre 1990-1994 ( je tenais à le préciser  par souci de transparence et aussi pour dire que, même si je crée cette  dispute artistique et cette controverse, il n´est nullement question pour moi de porter atteinte à sa personne). Sa démarche qui a consisté à condamner un geste en le prolongeant me laisse dubitatif. ""J'ai reçu la violence du geste de Zidane, depuis l'écran, en plein visage. J'ai voulu montrer le côté sombre du héros, le goût du destin inéluctable et l'immédiateté retentissante d'un geste"" , a-t-il expliqué:<br/><a href=""http://www.lefigaro.fr/arts-expositions/2012/09"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.lefigaro.fr/arts-expositions/2012/09</a>...</p><p>Pourquoi insister sur ce supposé côté sombre de Zidane; il n´a tout même pas tué Materazzi (qui de plus a surjoué sa chute)?Pourquoi cette dramatisation alors que Zidane a été sanctionné par l´arbitre du match qui lui a infligé un carton rouge. Pourquoi le punir Ad vitam æternam dans une sculpture qui réduit toute sa carrière à ce geste qu´ il a regretté?</p><p>Libre à lui d´avoir fait le choix de ce thème qui l´a inspiré: désigner Zidane comme le bourreau d´un innocent car c´est bien cela que sa sculpture ( Coup de Boule) montre. Libre aux autres d´en faire l´analyse et de lui opposer un autre regard, une autre œuvre et, c´est ce que je vais m´appliquer à faire  au bénéfice de la pluralité de la vérité et surtout de la diversité de l´art.

Tout conflit est complexe!</p><p>Quand on parle de ce fameux côté sombre de Zidane, on a l´impression qu' il est question d´une sorte de Jack l´Éventreur, d´un tueur en série, qui parallèlement à sa carrière de footballeur le jour, mène une vie de serial killer la nuit. Tout cela n´est pas sérieux. Est-on vertueux et exempt à ce point de ""côtés sombres""  pour les dénoncer et les statufier chez les autres?  À moins  d´être Hitler, Staline etc...  chaque humain a ses qualités et ses défauts.</p><p> </p><p>Inversement on peut désigner Zidane comme la victime et Materazzi comme l´agresseur car l´ayant provoqué à plusieurs reprises.

Déjà bien avant cette action, alors que le médecin de l´équipe soignait la clavicule déboîtée de Zidane qui était à terre ( un coéquipier de Zidane confie que Materazzi avait lancé à son encontre « il est mort le vieux».</p><p>La réalité est donc plus complexe que ce que donne à voir cette sculpture  diffamatoire à l´encontre de  Zidane. Materazzi a d´ailleurs été sanctionné par la commission de discipline de la Fédération internationale (Fifa). C'est la première fois, dans une affaire de discipline, que le provocateur est lui aussi condamné. confirme Jean-Pierre Escalettes, président de la Fédération française de football (FFF).</p><p> </p><p><strong>Analyse de la l´oeuvre ""Coup de Boule et l´avis des philosophes<br/>sur le mauvais geste de Zidane</strong></p><p>L´œuvre en question, en plus de ses nombreuses lacunes techniques, donne l´impression d´une figurine en dépit de ses cinq mètres. Elle ne rend aucunement la dynamique et l´esthétique de ce  « mauvais geste réussi... exécuté avec maestria »  [dixit Ollivier Pourriol] : <a href=""https://youtu.be/EggM9CxK0lY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://youtu.be/EggM9CxK0lY</a></p><p> </p><p>La sculpture monumentale n´est pas un instant photographique : l' artiste à réalisé une photographie en trois dimensions. Il en a repris naïvement (sans la maîtrise du langage et des techniques de la sculpture statuaire)  les détails (tous les plis des vêtements et toutes les rides des visages, le positionnement des bras ...) pensant atteindre par ce biais la force de cette action entre Zidane et Materazzi.  Le résultat est affligeant: deux mastodontes figés qui font la grimace. Ces erreurs monumentales ne sont pas étonnantes quand l' on sait que l' auteur n' est pas sculpteur mais peintre de formation à la base. S' il excelle dans ses installations et autres expérimentations conceptuelles, il n'a aucunement les moyens artistiques de l' art de la Sculpture statuaire. Néanmoins, cette œuvre recèle une qualité et pas des moindres: les proportions des corps des personnages sont justes.</p><p>Michel Serres parle du coup de boule de Zidane comme celui d´un Dieu de l´Olympe (Dieu colérique).Ollivier Pourriol, qui analysait le mauvais geste de Schumacher sur Battistan lors du France/ Allemagne (1982) et celui de Zidane dit: « Schumacher a fait un mauvais geste pour gagner, Zidane a fait un mauvais geste pour perdre, chez l´un il y a la mesquinerie de vouloir gagner, chezl´autre il y a la superbe de jouer une défaite plus grande (…) qui est la seule beauté qui reste dans la défaite.</p><p><strong>Zidane un héros national indéboulonnable ?</strong><br/>Loin des intentions et de la volonté de l´artiste évidement, son œuvre fait écho à ce discours raciste qui semblait n´avoir attendu que ce mauvais geste de Zidane pour entreprendre le déboulonnement de sa stature. Zizou passe subitement de statut de héros national à celui<br/>d´ « un jeune des quartiers difficiles qui ne sait s´exprimer que par la violence. Il est indigne de porter le maillot tricolore ... ».</p><p>Elle fait aussi écho à cette levée de boucliers aux desseins inavoués qui à longueur d´articles et d´émissions de télévision, dissertent  encore aujourd´hui sur les côtés sombres de Zidane et de sa supposée intouchabilité et aussi de sa relation à l´argent. </p><p>On insiste sur le fait qu´il gère parfaitement son image qui est son capital. On lui reproche de gagner beaucoup d´argent comme si c´était immoral et indigne de l´ amour que la France et le monde lui vouent. On lui reproche « ce coup de boule violent » devant des milliards de téléspectateurs et d´enfants en particulier qui n' a pas entamé sa popularité car intouchable ( le choix des mots n' est pas anodin) .</p><p><strong>Sur la question de la violence</strong>, notamment à la télévision, à côté des images des massacres de tout genre, la violence sexiste de la publicité, la violence tous azimuts des programmes destinés aux enfants et aux adolescents, le coup de boule de Zidane, passe pour une dispute de cour de récré. De qui se moque-t-on ? Au final, ce que l´on tente de nous expliquer par là, c’est que Zidane le ""violent"" le "" privilégié"", l' ""intouchable"",  le ""capitaliste"",  n´est pas digne d´être une icône française.</p><p>Mais rien n´y fait, en dépit de tout Zidane reste Zidane, cet amour absolu et irrationnel qu’on lui voue agace.</p><p>Georges Bizet l´a pourtant bien dit dans son opéra Carmen que j´apprécie particulièrement: « L´amour est un oiseau rebelle que nul ne peut apprivoiser » , « l´amour est enfant de Bohême il n´a jamais connu de loi ».</p><p>Issu d´une famille originaire de Kabylie, Zizou natif de Marseille où il a grandi  demeure le seul français originaire d´Afrique du Nord à devenir une telle icône française. C´est là justement que se situe  la grandeur et le génie de la France qui donne sa chance à tous ses enfants.</p><p>Après avoir brillé comme footballeur, Zidane brille de mille feux en sa qualité d´entraîneur français du Real Madrid. Il sera sans aucun doute dans un avenir proche le patron de l´équipe de France.<br/>La France a donné sa chance à Zizou et il le le lui rend brillamment</p><p>Si l´on veut sincèrement s´attaquer au monde de l´argent et aux côtés sombres de l´humanité, il faudrait prendre le problème à sa source et en commençant par son propre examen de conscience. Sinon, il serait plus honnête de ne pas s´ériger en donneur de leçons.</p><p> </p><p><strong>MON PROJET</strong></p><p>Il s´agit de statufier Zidane dignement et dans sa complexité d´Homme hors du commun.Avant d´aboutir à la composition actuelle, que je présenterai plus loin, je suis passé par plusieurs étapes. Au départ j´ai essayé d´opposer avec une pointe d´ humour au « coup de boule » de mon condisciple un « coup de tête » en référence au doublé de la tête par Zizou lors de la finale du « Mondial 1998 » face au Brésil. Cependant, les impératifs de l´école classique à laquelle j´appartiens, m´ont contraint à abandonner cette piste, les maquettes réalisées de Zizou dans l´action des deux buts de la tête ne répondaient pas aux critères d´une statue de facture classique qui exige de la sobriété et aussi que l´on dépasse la simple anecdote. De telles compositions sont destinées plus à la réalisation de figurines que de statues.</p><p>Chez Materazzi en Italie, à Florence plus précisément en août 2016 devant « David », la solution s´est révélée à moi. C´est ainsi que j´ai résolu la problématique de la composition de ma statue de Zidane. Je regardais « David » mais c´est Zidane que je voyais. Michel-Ange a sculpté son David dans un seul bloc de marbre de Carrare. Initialement placé à Florence devant le Palazzo Vecchio pour symboliser la détermination de la jeune République face aux tyrans (David est représenté ici juste avant son combat contre Goliath), l'original est exposé depuis 1873 dans la Galleria dell'Accademia : <a href=""http://www.florence-museum.com/fr/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.florence-museum.com/fr/</a></p><p> </p><p>À chaque fois que je suis devant ce marbre haut de cinq mètres, réalisé il y a cinq siècles, je n´ai pas l´impression de contempler une vieillerie. David demeure contemporain. Ce chef d´œuvre traverse allègrement les siècles et semble résolu à accompagner l´humanité jusqu´à la fin des temps.C´est une œuvre que je n´ai jamais fini de contempler. Á chaque visite je passe des heures à la dessiner et je la redécouvre à chaque fois nouvelle. Zidane exerce la même fascination sur des millions de gens. J´ai même entendu un journaliste sportif dire : «À chaque fois que je vois Zidane,je suis heureux » .</p><p> </p><p>Si j´ai choisi d´interpréter cette statue et sa symbolique, c´est moins par facilité que par défi. Le défi de revisiter ce monument de la renaissance vient de mon enracinement dans cette période de laquelle je puise mes interrogations artistiques présentes.</p><p>Le David de Michel-Ange est un jeune homme déterminé au regard menaçant, sa posture ne laisse aucun doute quant à l´issue du combat qu´il s´apprête à livrer contre le géant Goliath.Je trouve du David dans l´allure sobre de Zidane, le même froncement des sourcils qui soutient un regard glaçant fixant sans trembler celui de l´adversité.Avant cette finale du Mondial 1998, personne ne croyait à une victoire de la France face à ce géant qu´était le Brésil. À ce stade de la compétition Zizou n´avait marqué aucun but, il avait même été sorti sur carton rouge lors du premier tour après avoir essuyé ses crampons sur la cuisse d´un joueur saoudien qui l´avait taclé.</p><p>Sur un corner, comme surgissant de nulle part, il marque de la tête le premier but. Comme pour démontrer que ce premier but n´était pas le fruit du hasard, sur un autre corner, il marque à nouveau de la tête et „libère la France“. C’est à ce moment que le coup de foudre s´est produit pour donner naissance à un amour fou, donc inconditionnel, entre lui et la France. Zidane venait de conquérir à cet instant, à jamais, le cœur d´un pays qui a baigné cet été de 1998, dans une allégresse que certains n´ont pas hésité à comparer à celle de la libération.</p><p>L´héroïsme de Zidane c´est d´ avoir délivré la France de son complexe d´infériorité « footballistique ». Même si le mérite revient à toute l´équipe et son staff, c´est Zidane qui symbolise cette victoire aux yeux des français pour les raisons que j´ai proposées plus haut.C´est pourquoi j´ai choisi d´immortaliser cet événement, celui de la naissance d´une légende.</p><p> </p><p><strong>LA STATUE</strong></p><p>Titre:  Coup de Génie</p><p>Aspects techniques :</p><p>- Réalisation d´un bronze haut de deux à cinq mètres ou tiré en deux exemplaires de deux mètres chacun , selon les fonds récoltés. Il sera fixé sur un socle cubique en granit haut de 1/3 de la hauteur finale de la statue.</p><p>- Réalisation d´une plaque gravée des noms de tous les joueurs et ceux du staff technique del´équipe de France de 1998 (fixée sur le socle).</p><p>- Réalisation d´ne plaque comportant les noms des donateurs (fixée sur le socle)</p><p>Bronze : Alliage de cuivre et d'étain à forte teneur en cuivre (le plus souvent supérieure à 80 %).</p><p><strong>Aspect plastique :</strong><br/>Cette statue qui reprend presque dans le détail la composition de David, est un déhanché, elle représente Zizou pieds nus habillé d´une tenue de footballeur. Il tient de sa main droite contre sa hanche un ballon de football (David tient dans sa main gauche une pierre). La main du bras gauche replié sur l´épaule tient les lacets des crampons portés au dos (David porte ainsi sa fronde).</p><p>À l´arrière de sa jambe droite, le trophée du « Mondial 1998 » est posé.</p><p>Sur son maillot est dessiné un coq symbole de la France.</p><p>Comme toute figure allégorique cette représentation ne reprend pas une action réaliste, elle est une écriture complexe qui véhicule une multitude de symboliques. Un même détail peut signifier deux choses à la fois, il appartiendra au spectateur de les déchiffrer et de les interpréter au gré de son imagination.</p><p><strong>DESTINATION DE LA STATUE</strong> :<br/>(selon l´importance des fonds récoltés):Dans le cas de figure où elle serait tirée en deux exemplaires de deux mètres chacune, l´une sera destinée à la ville de Marseille et l´autre à la ville de Paris.</p><p>Dans le cas de figure ou elle serait tirée en un seul exemplaire de deux à cinq mètres de hauteur elle sera destinée naturellement à la ville de Marseille.</p><p> </p><p><strong>LES ÉTAPES DE RÉALISATION</strong> :<br/>(sur la base de la maquette existante et sur la base d´études - dessins- poussées du corps à l´aide d´un modèle vivant possédant les mêmes proportions que Zidane) :</p><p><br/>1-Modelage en argile puis moulage en plâtre d´une matrice d´un mètre de hauteur. Cette matrice servira de repère dans la réalisation de la statue finale (procédé habituel en sculpture monumentale).</p><p>2-Une fois la statue en argile achevée, elle sera moulée en plusieurs pièces. Les pièces seront ensuite réalisées en cire pour être coulées dans le bronze.</p><p>3- Une fois toutes les pièces coulées en bronze, débuteront les travaux d´assemblage et de soudure pour reconstituer la statue.</p><p>4- Une fois la statue reconstituée, pour affiner l´ensemble, elle sera ciselée pour la libérer des bavures de la fonte et des traces de soudures.</p><p>5- La statue sera ensuite patinée puis polie pour lui donner son aspect final.</p><p> </p><p><strong>LES DÉLAIS</strong>:</p><p>- 12 mois pour une statue de deux mètres</p><p>- 18 mois pour une statue de trois à quatre mètres- 20 à 24 mois pour une statue de cinq mètres.</p><p> </p><p>Ces délais qui peuvent sembler importants, sont dus au fait qu´il ne s´agit pas de terminer à tout prix mais, de faire et de refaire jusqu´à atteindre, même si cela restera une illusion, un but: celui de la beauté selon les critères de la statuaire classique, (équilibre, proportions et harmonie), conjuguée aux critères de la beauté de mon œil subjectif.</p><p> </p><p><strong>COÛTS </strong> (Ils englobent tous les frais liés à chaque étape de la réalisation) :</p><p>- €40.000 pour un exemplaire de deux mètres</p><p>- €60.000 pour deux exemplaires de deux mètres</p><p>- €80.000 pour un seul exemplaire de cinq mètres</p></div>","Pourquoi une autre statufication de Zinédine Zidane est-elle nécessaire?Ma motivation vient d´abord de mon métier de sculpteur hanté par des figures mythiques et iconographiques contemporaines qui me fascinent et me passionnent.

Il en a repris naïvement (sans la maîtrise du langage et des techniques de la sculpture statuaire)  les détails (tous les plis des vêtements et toutes les rides des visages, le positionnement des bras ...) pensant atteindre par ce biais la force de cette action entre Zidane et Materazzi.  Le résultat est affligeant: deux mastodontes figés qui font la grimace. Ces erreurs monumentales ne sont pas étonnantes quand l' on sait que l' auteur n' est pas sculpteur mais peintre de formation à la base. S' il excelle dans ses installations et autres expérimentations conceptuelles, il n'a aucunement les moyens artistiques de l' art de la Sculpture statuaire. Néanmoins, cette œuvre recèle une qualité et pas des moindres: les proportions des corps des personnages sont justes.Michel Serres parle du coup de boule de Zidane comme celui d´un Dieu de l´Olympe (Dieu colérique).Ollivier Pourriol, qui analysait le mauvais geste de Schumacher sur Battistan lors du France/ Allemagne (1982) et celui de Zidane dit: « Schumacher a fait un mauvais geste pour gagner, Zidane a fait un mauvais geste pour perdre, chez l´un il y a la mesquinerie de vouloir gagner, chezl´autre il y a la superbe de jouer une défaite plus grande (…) qui est la seule beauté qui reste dans la défaite.Zidane un héros national indéboulonnable ?Loin des intentions et de la volonté de l´artiste évidement, son œuvre fait écho à ce discours raciste qui semblait n´avoir attendu que ce mauvais geste de Zidane pour entreprendre le déboulonnement de sa stature. Zizou passe subitement de statut de héros national à celuid´ « un jeune des quartiers difficiles qui ne sait s´exprimer que par la violence. Il est indigne de porter le maillot tricolore ... ».Elle fait aussi écho à cette levée de boucliers aux desseins inavoués qui à longueur d´articles et d´émissions de télévision, dissertent  encore aujourd´hui sur les côtés sombres de Zidane et de sa supposée intouchabilité et aussi de sa relation à l´argent. On insiste sur le fait qu´il gère parfaitement son image qui est son capital. On lui reproche de gagner beaucoup d´argent comme si c´était immoral et indigne de l´ amour que la France et le monde lui vouent. On lui reproche « ce coup de boule violent » devant des milliards de téléspectateurs et d´enfants en particulier qui n' a pas entamé sa popularité car intouchable ( le choix des mots n' est pas anodin) .Sur la question de la violence, notamment à la télévision, à côté des images des massacres de tout genre, la violence sexiste de la publicité, la violence tous azimuts des programmes destinés aux enfants et aux adolescents, le coup de boule de Zidane, passe pour une dispute de cour de récré. De qui se moque-t-on ? Au final, ce que l´on tente de nous expliquer par là, c’est que Zidane le ""violent"" le "" privilégié"", l' ""intouchable"",  le ""capitaliste"",  n´est pas digne d´être une icône française.Mais rien n´y fait, en dépit de tout Zidane reste Zidane, cet amour absolu et irrationnel qu’on lui voue agace.Georges Bizet l´a pourtant bien dit dans son opéra Carmen que j´apprécie particulièrement: « L´amour est un oiseau rebelle que nul ne peut apprivoiser » , « l´amour est enfant de Bohême il n´a jamais connu de loi ».Issu d´une famille originaire de Kabylie, Zizou natif de Marseille où il a grandi  demeure le seul français originaire d´Afrique du Nord à devenir une telle icône française. C´est là justement que se situe  la grandeur et le génie de la France qui donne sa chance à tous ses enfants.Après avoir brillé comme footballeur, Zidane brille de mille feux en sa qualité d´entraîneur français du Real Madrid. Il sera sans aucun doute dans un avenir proche le patron de l´équipe de France.La France a donné sa chance à Zizou et il le le lui rend brillammentSi l´on veut sincèrement s´attaquer au monde de l´argent et aux côtés sombres de l´humanité, il faudrait prendre le problème à sa source et en commençant par son propre examen de conscience. Sinon, il serait plus honnête de ne pas s´ériger en donneur de leçons. MON PROJETIl s´agit de statufier Zidane dignement et dans sa complexité d´Homme hors du commun.Avant d´aboutir à la composition actuelle, que je présenterai plus loin, je suis passé par plusieurs étapes. Au départ j´ai essayé d´opposer avec une pointe d´ humour au « coup de boule » de mon condisciple un « coup de tête » en référence au doublé de la tête par Zizou lors de la finale du « Mondial 1998 » face au Brésil. Cependant, les impératifs de l´école classique à laquelle j´appartiens, m´ont contraint à abandonner cette piste, les maquettes réalisées de Zizou dans l´action des deux buts de la tête ne répondaient pas aux critères d´une statue de facture classique qui exige de la sobriété et aussi que l´on dépasse la simple anecdote. De telles compositions sont destinées plus à la réalisation de figurines que de statues.Chez Materazzi en Italie, à Florence plus précisément en août 2016 devant « David », la solution s´est révélée à moi. C´est ainsi que j´ai résolu la problématique de la composition de ma statue de Zidane. Je regardais « David » mais c´est Zidane que je voyais. Michel-Ange a sculpté son David dans un seul bloc de marbre de Carrare. Initialement placé à Florence devant le Palazzo Vecchio pour symboliser la détermination de la jeune République face aux tyrans (David est représenté ici juste avant son combat contre Goliath), l'original est exposé depuis 1873 dans la Galleria dell'Accademia : http://www.florence-museum.com/fr/ À chaque fois que je suis devant ce marbre haut de cinq mètres, réalisé il y a cinq siècles, je n´ai pas l´impression de contempler une vieillerie. David demeure contemporain. Ce chef d´œuvre traverse allègrement les siècles et semble résolu à accompagner l´humanité jusqu´à la fin des temps.C´est une œuvre que je n´ai jamais fini de contempler. Á chaque visite je passe des heures à la dessiner et je la redécouvre à chaque fois nouvelle. Zidane exerce la même fascination sur des millions de gens. J´ai même entendu un journaliste sportif dire : «À chaque fois que je vois Zidane,je suis heureux » . Si j´ai choisi d´interpréter cette statue et sa symbolique, c´est moins par facilité que par défi. Le défi de revisiter ce monument de la renaissance vient de mon enracinement dans cette période de laquelle je puise mes interrogations artistiques présentes.Le David de Michel-Ange est un jeune homme déterminé au regard menaçant, sa posture ne laisse aucun doute quant à l´issue du combat qu´il s´apprête à livrer contre le géant Goliath.Je trouve du David dans l´allure sobre de Zidane, le même froncement des sourcils qui soutient un regard glaçant fixant sans trembler celui de l´adversité.Avant cette finale du Mondial 1998, personne ne croyait à une victoire de la France face à ce géant qu´était le Brésil. À ce stade de la compétition Zizou n´avait marqué aucun but, il avait même été sorti sur carton rouge lors du premier tour après avoir essuyé ses crampons sur la cuisse d´un joueur saoudien qui l´avait taclé.Sur un corner, comme surgissant de nulle part, il marque de la tête le premier but. Comme pour démontrer que ce premier but n´était pas le fruit du hasard, sur un autre corner, il marque à nouveau de la tête et „libère la France“. C’est à ce moment que le coup de foudre s´est produit pour donner naissance à un amour fou, donc inconditionnel, entre lui et la France. Zidane venait de conquérir à cet instant, à jamais, le cœur d´un pays qui a baigné cet été de 1998, dans une allégresse que certains n´ont pas hésité à comparer à celle de la libération.L´héroïsme de Zidane c´est d´ avoir délivré la France de son complexe d´infériorité « footballistique ». Même si le mérite revient à toute l´équipe et son staff, c´est Zidane qui symbolise cette victoire aux yeux des français pour les raisons que j´ai proposées plus haut.C´est pourquoi j´ai choisi d´immortaliser cet événement, celui de la naissance d´une légende. LA STATUETitre:  Coup de GénieAspects techniques :- Réalisation d´un bronze haut de deux à cinq mètres ou tiré en deux exemplaires de deux mètres chacun , selon les fonds récoltés. Il sera fixé sur un socle cubique en granit haut de 1/3 de la hauteur finale de la statue.- Réalisation d´une plaque gravée des noms de tous les joueurs et ceux du staff technique del´équipe de France de 1998 (fixée sur le socle).- Réalisation d´ne plaque comportant les noms des donateurs (fixée sur le socle)Bronze : Alliage de cuivre et d'étain à forte teneur en cuivre (le plus souvent supérieure à 80 %).Aspect plastique :Cette statue qui reprend presque dans le détail la composition de David, est un déhanché, elle représente Zizou pieds nus habillé d´une tenue de footballeur. Il tient de sa main droite contre sa hanche un ballon de football (David tient dans sa main gauche une pierre). La main du bras gauche replié sur l´épaule tient les lacets des crampons portés au dos (David porte ainsi sa fronde).À l´arrière de sa jambe droite, le trophée du « Mondial 1998 » est posé.Sur son maillot est dessiné un coq symbole de la France.Comme toute figure allégorique cette représentation ne reprend pas une action réaliste, elle est une écriture complexe qui véhicule une multitude de symboliques. Un même détail peut signifier deux choses à la fois, il appartiendra au spectateur de les déchiffrer et de les interpréter au gré de son imagination.DESTINATION DE LA STATUE :(selon l´importance des fonds récoltés):Dans le cas de figure où elle serait tirée en deux exemplaires de deux mètres chacune, l´une sera destinée à la ville de Marseille et l´autre à la ville de Paris.Dans le cas de figure ou elle serait tirée en un seul exemplaire de deux à cinq mètres de hauteur elle sera destinée naturellement à la ville de Marseille. LES ÉTAPES DE RÉALISATION :(sur la base de la maquette existante et sur la base d´études - dessins- poussées du corps à l´aide d´un modèle vivant possédant les mêmes proportions que Zidane) :1-Modelage en argile puis moulage en plâtre d´une matrice d´un mètre de hauteur. Cette matrice servira de repère dans la réalisation de la statue finale (procédé habituel en sculpture monumentale).2-Une fois la statue en argile achevée, elle sera moulée en plusieurs pièces. Les pièces seront ensuite réalisées en cire pour être coulées dans le bronze.3- Une fois toutes les pièces coulées en bronze, débuteront les travaux d´assemblage et de soudure pour reconstituer la statue.4- Une fois la statue reconstituée, pour affiner l´ensemble, elle sera ciselée pour la libérer des bavures de la fonte et des traces de soudures.5- La statue sera ensuite patinée puis polie pour lui donner son aspect final. LES DÉLAIS:- 12 mois pour une statue de deux mètres- 18 mois pour une statue de trois à quatre mètres- 20 à 24 mois pour une statue de cinq mètres. Ces délais qui peuvent sembler importants, sont dus au fait qu´il ne s´agit pas de terminer à tout prix mais, de faire et de refaire jusqu´à atteindre, même si cela restera une illusion, un but: celui de la beauté selon les critères de la statuaire classique, (équilibre, proportions et harmonie), conjuguée aux critères de la beauté de mon œil subjectif. COÛTS  (Ils englobent tous les frais liés à chaque étape de la réalisation) :- €40.000 pour un exemplaire de deux mètres- €60.000 pour deux exemplaires de deux mètres- €80.000 pour un seul exemplaire de cinq mètres",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Many youth who offer technical and vocational courses at school are usually looked down on making them loose their vision but I see a bright future with an Art Center for the youth to be trained and offered jobs to earn a living aside receiving training.</p>
<p>This campaign is important to me as I don't want potential leaders loose perspective in life, but to make a great impact to the generation to come and empower the weak visioned to grow big in vision.</p>
<p>If I am funded, i personally will be a stable worker along with the poor but talented youth in my community and we can secure a great future, I promise to make donors proud and nothing less.</p>

<h3>About Baluk Arts and InCahoots</h3>
<p>Baluk Arts is a non-profit Victorian Aboriginal arts organisation based in Mornington and owned by Aboriginal artists from Frankston, the Mornington Peninsula and greater Melbourne.  Member artists belong to diverse Aboriginal backgrounds from all over Australia. Baluk is a local Boonwurrung word meaning many or group of people.</p>
<p>Baluk Arts was selected to participate in an innovative project called InCahoots, which has seen 12 of our members collaborate with Neil Aldum, a Perth-based artist. While the artist's origins are diverse their community is connected by common narratives of disconnection of family, language and country.Together they have shaped a series of sculptures that speak of the contentedness of these upheavals and solace that comes from their shared experience – undulating and moving together with the changing physical and cultural landscape. Using ancient igneous rock as their counterweights each pendulum contains works that speak of their personal stories.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Baluk Arts aims to raise $5000 to cover accommodation and travel costs for our artists to get to the exhibition opening in Fremantle, WA.  </p>

Baluk Arts is a non-profit Victorian Aboriginal arts organisation based in Mornington and owned by Aboriginal artists from Frankston, the Mornington Peninsula and greater Melbourne.  Member artists belong to diverse Aboriginal backgrounds from all over Australia. Baluk is a local Boonwurrung word meaning many or group of people.
Baluk Arts was selected to participate in an innovative project called InCahoots, which has seen 12 of our members collaborate with Neil Aldum, a Perth-based artist. While the artist's origins are diverse their community is connected by common narratives of disconnection of family, language and country.Together they have shaped a series of sculptures that speak of the contentedness of these upheavals and solace that comes from their shared experience – undulating and moving together with the changing physical and cultural landscape. Using ancient igneous rock as their counterweights each pendulum contains works that speak of their personal stories.

What We Need
Baluk Arts aims to raise $5000 to cover accommodation and travel costs for our artists to get to the exhibition opening in Fremantle, WA.

Our spinners will be fabricated in Metal, Wood and tons of Devotion, and are designed to fit this year's YOUtopia theme 'Vintage Future Playground'.<br/><br/>Unlike the nostalgic 1980s version, these spinners are sized comfortably for adults. The spinners are 3.5’ in diameter, approximately 4’ total height, and can fit two people comfortably on the wooden surface.<br/><br/>In the daytime, these are beautiful painted rotating sculptures, with a spiral pattern on the sitting surface, and bright colors on the highly sculpted stem and base. At night, the spinners have embedded lights beneath the surface, and emanate different light patterns as you spin. Together, these spinning sculptures make a beautiful and surreal visual.<br/><br/>While we have been awarded an Art Grant by the YOUtopia Festival that only provides a portion of funding, and it's a highly engineered project with currently over 100 hours of engineering work and plenty more to go. Metal fabrication costs alone are thousands of dollars, and we need your help. We need to raise $3,600 in order to accomplish this goal, however, if we do, the joys of our project will be experienced by thousands, and you will have helped provide that joy!<br/><br/>After YOUtopia 2018, the pair of these interactive sculptures will venture out into the large revolving world, looking for a home where people can enjoy them daily. Sophi KravItz, our engineering lead has already done this with interactive sculpture, the most recent piece having started with a Large Art Grant from Burning Man, 'Loquacious and Lovely, Mythical Talking Unicorns'. These friendly, magical creatures, had a residency at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum in Grand Rapids Michigan.
