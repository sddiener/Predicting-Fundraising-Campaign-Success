<p>*****IF WE DON'T RAISE ENOUGH MONEY TO MAKE THE SHOES. YOU WILL GET A REFUND!!!*******<br/>So for years and years, I wore Chucks. When I was in high school you could pick them up at the mall for 20 something bucks. For a long time they were considered ""alternative"" to other over priced, over hyped, over padded sneakers with springs and pumps made by giant blood sucking corporations. So all us ""alternative kids"" wore them while we checked our pagers and updated our live journals. Not long after in 2003, one of the big blood sucking corporations bought out the slightly less big less blood sucking corporation that made Chucks and immediately jacked up the price to $45. LAME! I just started wearing the more expensive leather version because they lasted longer and the canvas version didn't seem worth the price anymore. Fast forward to 2012, I was broke but I needed an extra pair of shoes for work. I didn't want to buy the expensive leather ones because my job wore the soles out too fast. That's when I realized the canvas shoes were now $55. TOO FAR! TOO FAR! I remembered that some stores had canvas sneakers that looked <em>exactly</em> like Chucks for way less money. I went around trying to find them. Everywhere I went were either out of them, didn't have my size, didn't have men's, only had lo-tops, etc. I tried to find some online, but they didn't have brand names. You can't just google ""cheap fake Chucks"" and find them. So I thought ""I'll make them! I'll make canvas sneakers with their own brand name (which could be yours!) and logo that you can buy online. They'll be just like Chucks, only cheaper!""</p>

<p>Our campaign is in the home stretch! We're blown away by the generosity and support from everyone who has contributed. To thank you, and make one final push, we've designed an additional 12"" X 12"" screen print that we are giving to everyone that has backed us if we can get past the <strong>$5,000 </strong>mark. So spread the word one last time and help us go out with a bang.</p>

<h2><strong>The World Needs More Bombs.</strong></h2>
<p>There's a lot of bad in the world, but it doesn’t stand a chance against the power of good. We want to give the good a little extra <em>oomph</em> by hijacking a symbol of conflict, war, terror, pain and destruction and turning it into a beacon of cooperation, peace, love, hope and change. Let's make the world a happier place, one bomb at a time.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What We Do:</strong></h2>
<p><span>We make t-shirts (and stickers and prints). We think our designs make a statement about who you are and what you believe in. They also say you look awesome and have impeccable taste. So, it's pretty much the total package. </span></p>
<p><span>Here are a few of the HappyBombs we’ve already designed that represent causes we plan to support in our inaugural year:</span></p>
<p><strong>The Original HappyBomb line:</strong></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/910272/pictures/full/20130704111303-happybombs-woundedwarriors-revised.jpg?1372961589"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.5em;""> </strong></p>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">How It Works:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step one:</strong> We identify a worthy cause.</p>
<p><strong>Step two:</strong> We design a HappyBomb inspired by that cause.</p>
<p><strong>Step three:</strong> We give <em>half the profits</em> to an innovative charity dedicated to that cause.</p>
<p>To start out, every month we will be supporting a different cause by launching a new line of HappyBombs (T-shirts, stickers, prints) inspired by their mission. Then using our social channels, we will dedicate the entire month to raising awareness and hopefully money to support their work.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What We Believe:</strong></h2>
<p><strong>We believe in sharing. </strong>That's why our plan to open up our design process to anyone who wants to be involved. If you submit a design and we use it, you'll get full credit on our site, a link back to your portfolio and a share from our portion of the profits. If all goes according to plan (twists his mustache), there will be plenty to go around.</p>
<p><strong>We believe in the power of positivity.</strong> Every action we take and decision we make will be positive. That means, whenever possible, we will work with socially conscious companies like <a href=""http://www.socialimprints.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Social Imprints</a> who use environmentally friendly materials and printing practices. And of course, all our products will be made right here in the USA. </p>
<p><strong>We believe in aid not ads. </strong>To ensure that we are giving as much as we possibly can to every cause, we will not be paying for media. Instead, we will be relying on the power of social media and (fingers crossed) the passion of our supporters to spread the word.</p>

<h2>Who We Are:</h2>

<p><span>We used to work together at an advertising agency in Boston. We spent our days (and nights) thinking up new ways to build our clients’ businesses. It was fun. And we were good at it. But we felt like something was missing. Then it clicked. We realized all of our time and energy was being devoted to building their dreams, not ours. </span></p>
<p><span>And Boom. HappyBombs was born.</span></p>
<p><span>Okay, so it wasn’t that simple. We’ve actually spent many nights and weekends over the last three years talking, researching, designing, refining, finding a printer, finding the perfect t-shirt, filling out paperwork, building a website, more refining, more designing and here we are. Locked, loaded, and ready to launch this company. Almost.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<h2><span>Why We're Here:</span></h2>
<p>To bring HappyBombs to life we are going to need a little help. A little <em>more</em> help we should say, since we’ve gotten some amazing contributions from our friends along the way. <strong>But to make this dream a reality, we need to raise some money. And that is why we're on Indiegogo. </strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to raise enough money to fund our first three months of printing. This will include printing some of the HappyBomb lines mentioned above and printing a run of stickers. </p>
<p>Hopefully after a few months we will be a household name (dream big, right?) and we can start printing multiple shirts, stickers, and posters for every cause. But in the event we don’t blow-up over night (yeah, we said it), any amount we raise beyond our initial goal will simply go toward printing additional lines of HappyBombs. The more support we get, the more we can make. </p>

<p>As some of you know a lot about design, I’m not gonna waste your time. But, need your help for the project named Exility Design, a research platform on design with a real demand ! it a collection of data on design for academics, students, opinion leaders… </p>
<h2>it's about creative design process!</h2>

<h2>I'm developping a research platform on design (with your help)!</h2>
<p>Exility Design is a <strong>research support</strong>, <strong>observation of design</strong> and all its applications: Art, Architecture, furniture, decoration, motors ... to foster learning and fun. It will be the benchmark of international design. This will allow the centralization of knowledge, skills and tools for creating the design through contemporary design news, articles, news items, studies, <strong>analysis, in-depth reflection</strong>, specialists’ intervention, videos, interviews, photos, audio.</p>
<p>The objective is to create an <strong>online database</strong>, a <strong>source of inspiration</strong> and <strong>knowledge</strong>, in an accessible format in which contemporary art, design and architecture meet. Architecture in which dissolves in design, visual arts are diluted in fashion, styling blends with the decor.

A research platform on design
 Hi, I'm Blue Eve! 

Ever since my mom's dream of me becoming a lawyer fell through, I spend most of my time reading, searching and writting some articles. 
As some of you know a lot about design, I’m not gonna waste your time. But, need your help for the project named Exility Design, a research platform on design with a real demand ! it a collection of data on design for academics, students, opinion leaders… 
it's about creative design process!
Check out this video by BMW... it's not only a really nice car, it's about reflection, ideas, work, creativity... http://youtu.be/kTYiEkQYhWY

 
I'm developping a research platform on design (with your help)!
Exility Design is a research support, observation of design and all its applications: Art, Architecture, furniture, decoration, motors ... to foster learning and fun. It will be the benchmark of international design. This will allow the centralization of knowledge, skills and tools for creating the design through contemporary design news, articles, news items, studies, analysis, in-depth reflection, specialists’ intervention, videos, interviews, photos, audio.
The objective is to create an online database, a source of inspiration and knowledge, in an accessible format in which contemporary art, design and architecture meet. Architecture in which dissolves in design, visual arts are diluted in fashion, styling blends with the decor. If we can raise the money, this platform will only take 6 months of dedicated development to get into everyone's hands.

""Why is Exility Design platform Now?""
It's something I've always wanted to do! I love research, publication and especially share ideas, my treasure and if I could get together with researchers and opinion leaders to make this project real, I think we could make something good to support a real need !
I get bored really easily, so trust me, this platform is gonna have to be awesome!

It takes more than just an idea to create something as epic as Exility Design. There are the website developers, graphic artists, journalists... and that's just to name a few.

<p>Hello fellow artists! Thank you so much for checking out this campaign.</p>
<p>Would you like a place to create art alongside others that will not only help you in the development of your craft, but potentially get you work and advance your career?</p>
<p>Or, are you someone that would like to explore a creative field in movie making but have no means to do so?</p>
<p>We stand ready to create this place for you! Where artists can create whenever they want, without restriction, in a community of other enthusiastic artists.</p>
<p><em>With the Internet we have only begun to skim the surface of what collaborative art can be about!</em></p>
<p>And, with <a href=""http://MoviesIndeed.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MoviesIndeed.com</a>, we are taking a big step toward what is actually possible. Please consider contributing to this project and join us in creating a format that give artists more control over their own careers.</p>
<p>Contact us with any questions about this project at buzz@moviesindeed.com.</p>
<p>Be sure to sign up to our mailing list at: <a href=""http://www.moviesindeed.com/crowdfunding"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.moviesindeed.com/crowdfunding</a></p>
<p>Now Hiring: <a href=""http://www.moviesindeed.com/hiring"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.moviesindeed.com/hiring</a></p>
<p>Please fill out an online application at the URL above and be a part of the original crew that creates the first fully produced feature off the site! We need writers, actors, musicians, foley artists, sound designers and illustrators.</p>
<p><strong>This project is multifaceted.</strong></p>
<p>First, it is to complete the collaborative art website, <a href=""http://MoviesIndeed.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MoviesIndeed.com</a>, <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>which stands at about 60% complete right now</strong>.</span> This site will provide a platform for anyone to work on movie or TV scripts right from their home. Activities include writing, acting, sound effect and soundtrack production, storyboard illustration and audience participation.</p>
<p>Second, the funding includes the hiring of talent to create the first few scripts. I want to hire as many artists as we can and continue to employ artists even after the initial scripts on the site are completed.</p>
<p>Finally, the project includes the actual production of the first completed script off the site. This script (or scripts if we receive more funding) will be written by the people hired.</p>
<p>How big we start off completely depends on YOU! The more funding we receive the more artists we can hire and the more scripts we can get produced!</p>
<p><strong>Networking</strong></p>
<p>As anyone in the industry will tell you, “It's who you know”. Of course it is! Networking on the site happens in many ways, from meeting through working on scripts, to live and forum chats, to messaging. An online contact book will be provided so you don't lose track of people.</p>
<p><strong>Groups and Troupes</strong></p>
<p>We can expect that people will gravitate towards working with people they've enjoyed working with in the past. We will give you the ability to form named groups, whether it be writers, actors, or a mix of different artists (a production company). Projects can be created and completed by groups rather than by individuals.</p>
<p><strong>Feedback</strong></p>
<p>You get feedback only when you request it. Feedback is given in response to a question you pose.</p>
<p>“I wanted to foreshadow the next scene with this sound clip, is that the mood you wanted to capture?”</p>
<p>“Which of these performances do you prefer?” (You will have the ability to upload more than one version of something)</p>
<p>“Do like this style of writing or this one for this scene?”</p>
<p>""What are your impressions of this performance?"" etc.</p>
<p>Additionally, you have the choice as to WHO you want to ask. Specific friends? Members of your group/troupe? Members of the script you're working on? Or, brave soul, the audience?</p>
<p>Of course, when you receive applause from the audience for your work, this also gives you feedback on what you're doing.</p>
<p>The final method of getting feedback is by private mentor. See the educational section on this.</p>
<p><strong>Basic, Advanced and Professional Sections</strong></p>
<p>The Basic section is for novices or people wanting to dabble in the creative process. You can create alias accounts for this purpose so you can explore or experiment aside from your main account. With the Basic section you can explore creative areas it would have been difficult to get into before.</p>
<p>The Advanced section is for people who really want to put their best effort into making scripts and script productions. Everyone is expected to complete their tasks in a timely manner. The head writer has the ability to suspend users should they suddenly become absent.</p>
<p>Both the Basic and Advanced sections are free of charge to users.</p>
<p>The Professional section is a 'private studio' for those wanting to collaborate with others in some fashion, whether it be with other writers and artists or with a private screening audience.</p>
<p>This is a paid section of the site and is completely secure and private.</p>
<p><strong>Fans and Applause</strong></p>
<p>Applause is achieved after something you've created is published on the site, whether it be an acting file, clip of a soundtrack, illustration, etc. The amount of total applause you've received is shown on your profile page. It is also computed with experience, number of winning votes and amount of fans to give you an overall 'Star Rating'. See Star Rating.</p>
<p>Your fans are those who actively follow you. It's not a permanent status achieved by someone clicking to become your fan one time. If a fan hasn't followed your last few works, they are dropped as a fan. Because of this, when you tell agents, managers and producers your Fan Number, they will know that these fans are very much participating in what you do online.</p>
<p><strong>Education</strong></p>
<p>An integral part of the financial success of the site will be providing educational opportunities. Not only will this bring in revenue, but by helping artists grow and get work we are building alliances.</p>
<p>Plans for education and mentoring are:</p>
<p>·<strong>Online webinars</strong> with A-list professionals in the industry. Online webinars are great because you get live training with a Hollywood insider but at a very affordable cost. In a webinar, you are free to get all your questions answered and get information you would be hard pressed to get any other way. We already have one 20-year writing veteran, Stephanie Phillips, on board to deliver webinars covering topics, such as: Turning Your Idea into an Outline, Advanced Screenwriting, and Learning How to Pitch. We will also seek out other accomplished and well-known artists. Imagine that, even if you’re living in a small town in Indiana, that you can get acting tips from someone you've only seen on TV or in the movies. I want to bring this to you!</p>
<p>·<strong>Private, one-on-one mentoring</strong> with a pro of your choice. For the student, this provides the best form of education: the private mentor. For the educator, this provides an opportunity to make money helping others. This person can follow you on your scripts, join you in private scripts, you can assist them on script by providing feedback, etc. In order to become a private mentor you must have achieved good success in your field and provide an excellent resume.</p>
<p>·<strong>Live group writing sessions</strong> is where you and a few other writers join a professional writer to create a script. It is on-the-job-training to the extreme. Each writer will submit scenes inside a private forum and the pro writer will decide on the winning scene, of course, providing feedback. The pro writer will suggest courses of action and offer advice along the way. There is nothing like writing and getting immediate feedback from a pro to learn the art of writing! And, if the script is of good quality Stephanie can submit it to agents and producers. Imagine getting a great education and at the same time have the potential for the script that is produced getting optioned! You're not going to get this possibility within a traditional classroom setting!</p>
<p><strong>The Star Rating System</strong></p>
<p>There will be different, achievable levels for any role, even audience members. Beside your name are icons, one for each artistic field you engage in. These icons change color based on your level of 'expertise', or 'Stardom'</p>
<p>Levels of Expertise/Stardom are based on different elements:</p>
<p>·<strong>Experience:</strong> Most of your overall Star Rating is attributed to how much experience you have in that area on the site. The backbone of everything, from artistic development to site success, is based how much you actually do. So, this will have the greatest impact on your Star Status/Expertise Level.</p>
<p>·<strong>Applause Credits:</strong> Anything that you upload onto the site can receive applause. This counts towards your score</p>
<p>·<strong>Winning submissions:</strong> if you work as a writer, the number of winning scenes counts towards your Star Rating.</p>
<p>·<strong>Audience Voting:</strong> credits for voting elevate your status as an audience member. Different levels carry different weight. If you have achieved a high status as an audience member, your vote could count as 2, 3, 4 etc., votes. In order to be paid royalties as an Audience member you need to achieve a particular level.</p>
<p>·<strong>Other elements</strong> can affect the rating, like number of fans, winning awards at the Annual Awards ceremony, scripts that get picked up or produced, etc.</p>
<p><strong>50 Script Launch</strong></p>
<p><strong>50 scripts...that sounds ambitious! </strong></p>
<p>What is life without a little ambition? The goal of 50 scripts is an ideal, but adequate funds would be needed to hire staff sufficient to fully create that many scripts. Also, all scripts wouldn't need to be full-feature productions. There can be trailers, short scripts, etc.</p>
<p>The first goal of the site is to get a script produced by a local theatrical company here in Los Angeles. As one of the goals for users of the site is to get their work picked up and produced, we need to make the first goal of the site the production of a script. In this way we all have a real product in our hands, which provides inspiration.</p>
<p>Of course, the more scripts we have to choose from to produce the better our chances of getting a great production.</p>
<p>We will create special function on the site for the sole purpose of getting that first great script.</p>
<p>We can start the site with 50 script ideas very easily, hiring 25 writers to write 50 loglines, hiring 50 writers to write one, etc. From there we will have people vote on their favorite ideas, which will make it to the second level of actually getting started writing and online production. For example, out of the first 50 script ideas we may narrow that down to the top 25 ideas and then we may have the first 5 scenes made on these. Out of these 25 we may narrow it down to 10 and then get these through the first or second acts. Then out of these 10, after the first or second act, we may narrow that down to the top 3. These may get fully produced on-site, with the community voting on which will make it to off-site, full video production. With sufficient budget we could get more than one produced.</p>
<p>We will have consultants who monitor the scripts and offer estimates on the costs of producing a scene/script so that we can keep the writing in line with the actual budget.</p>
<p>The details above are not set in stone right now and are mostly dependent on budgetary restrictions. We can do a lot more with $1,000,000 than with $125,000, of course!</p>
<p>Different options could include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>·one Flagship production (a must)</p>
<p>·one low-budget theatrical production</p>
<p>·a one-man stage production</p>
<p>Not all productions have to cost a lot of money. Casa 0101, for example, is a company that specializes in helping writers of all different financial backgrounds. A low-budget production of a stage script could only cost $1,000. This type of production isn't done to try to pack theaters across the county, but to give writers and artists inspiration to see their work actually produced. To hear one's words spoken on a live stage provides a great reward to writers as well as inspiration to the entire community.</p>
<p>Will your script be next?</p>
<p>I would like to see scripts get produced regularly off the site. We could have a quarterly 'winning scripts' that gets voted for production.</p>
<p>My vision is that production companies all over the world can bid on projects. The flow could be:</p>
<p>Every 3 months scripts of various nature are voted upon to get produced. Production companies bid on the projects. You can see reels of other works produced by these companies on the site. The community votes on which bid to accept. After a winning bid is accepted we go into a funding period. This can be done on <a href=""http://Kickstarter.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Indiegogo.com</a>. Upon funding the production company is placed on a schedule to get production completed in a timely manner. Updates to users are required.</p>
<p><strong>A Strict, User-Enforced, No-Negativity Policy</strong></p>
<p>Because creativity flourishes best in a positive, supportive environment, we will create a strict, no-negativity policy that is enforced by users. If you leave a comment that is deemed as ‘not constructive’, other users can flag it. After a certain amount of flags the comment will automatically be removed.</p>
<p>Feedback is only given if it was requested by the artist. If comments are given without request, aside from wholly positive ones, the comment would be removed. If feedback is requested, then your comments should be made in a constructive manner. If you don’t know how to make constructive comments, well, you will learn very quickly! :)</p>
<p>Anyone continually getting flagged for violating the policy can have their account suspended. I don’t anticipate that people will be abusing this policy, however.</p>
<p><strong>Promotion Via MoviesIndeed.com</strong></p>
<p>There will be many opportunities for you to promote yourself and your art via the site. For everything you publish on the site, links will be provided not only to your MoviesIndeed profile but also off-site links to hire you, buy your art/music, speak to you about private lessons, etc.</p>
<p>For example, maybe you have a great band and want to promote your music. You can use your band’s music as the basis of a soundtrack. Links can be provided alongside your soundtrack directly to a site where people can buy your music.</p>
<p>I also plan to draw an alliance with a freelance site like <a href=""http://elance.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">elance.com</a>, <a href=""http://odesk.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">odesk.com</a>, <a href=""http://freelancer.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">freelancer.com</a>. I've hired hundreds of people over the years through these sites. Let's say you're an illustrator, you can have an account at one of these sites with a link to hire you, connected to every illustration you upload.</p>
<p><strong>Script Submission Service</strong></p>
<p>We can have Stephanie Phillips, our professional staff writer, evaluate your privately written script and, if it is of sufficient caliber, have it submitted to agents, managers and producers. Know that we will only take scripts that she feels has a 'shot'. This will not be a service where we take a script, charge you a fee and mail it out. You would need to have your script evaluated and only those that Stephanie feels are of high caliber will be circulated. Stephanie has many contacts in the industry and needs to maintain a reputation, so when she presents a script to someone they will know it's going to be strong.</p>
<p><strong>Other Site Functions To Add:</strong></p>
<p>·A rating system: do you want your script to be G, PG, R, etc.?</p>
<p>·How long do you want a script to be? A 5 min stage production? A 2 min movie trailer? 30 min TV show? A full 90 min feature?</p>
<p>·A platform for different musicians to contribute to a soundtrack. For example, a guitarist uploads a musical segment, timed with a click, which is downloaded by a bass player and bongo player who each adds their parts. The click is taken off and the final product is uploaded to the script. Of course it’s usually best to lay down percussion first for a final track, so the coordination of moving beyond a scratch track is up to the musicians.</p>
<p>·Alongside the logline is a listing of positions needed to fill the script, like 'Foley Artist Needed'. Also listed is the current completion level.</p>
<p>·Upgrade the messaging system so that people can send bulk messages to specific categories of artists. For example, you need an illustrator, so you send a message to all illustrators (who agree to accept bulk messages) asking for someone to join your script</p>
<p>·Input a partially completed script, inviting others to continue from the point you left off.</p>
<p>Did you read all of this? Dang you are interested! The only things left to do are make a contribution and tell your friends. :)</p>
<p>See you soon!</p>
<p>Much love,</p>

It is also computed with experience, number of winning votes and amount of fans to give you an overall 'Star Rating'. See Star Rating.
Your fans are those who actively follow you. It's not a permanent status achieved by someone clicking to become your fan one time. If a fan hasn't followed your last few works, they are dropped as a fan. Because of this, when you tell agents, managers and producers your Fan Number, they will know that these fans are very much participating in what you do online.
Education
An integral part of the financial success of the site will be providing educational opportunities. Not only will this bring in revenue, but by helping artists grow and get work we are building alliances.
Plans for education and mentoring are:
·Online webinars with A-list professionals in the industry. Online webinars are great because you get live training with a Hollywood insider but at a very affordable cost. In a webinar, you are free to get all your questions answered and get information you would be hard pressed to get any other way. We already have one 20-year writing veteran, Stephanie Phillips, on board to deliver webinars covering topics, such as: Turning Your Idea into an Outline, Advanced Screenwriting, and Learning How to Pitch. We will also seek out other accomplished and well-known artists. Imagine that, even if you’re living in a small town in Indiana, that you can get acting tips from someone you've only seen on TV or in the movies. I want to bring this to you!
·Private, one-on-one mentoring with a pro of your choice. For the student, this provides the best form of education: the private mentor. For the educator, this provides an opportunity to make money helping others. This person can follow you on your scripts, join you in private scripts, you can assist them on script by providing feedback, etc. In order to become a private mentor you must have achieved good success in your field and provide an excellent resume.
·Live group writing sessions is where you and a few other writers join a professional writer to create a script. It is on-the-job-training to the extreme. Each writer will submit scenes inside a private forum and the pro writer will decide on the winning scene, of course, providing feedback. The pro writer will suggest courses of action and offer advice along the way. There is nothing like writing and getting immediate feedback from a pro to learn the art of writing! And, if the script is of good quality Stephanie can submit it to agents and producers. Imagine getting a great education and at the same time have the potential for the script that is produced getting optioned! You're not going to get this possibility within a traditional classroom setting!
The Star Rating System
There will be different, achievable levels for any role, even audience members. Beside your name are icons, one for each artistic field you engage in. These icons change color based on your level of 'expertise', or 'Stardom'
Levels of Expertise/Stardom are based on different elements:
·Experience: Most of your overall Star Rating is attributed to how much experience you have in that area on the site. The backbone of everything, from artistic development to site success, is based how much you actually do. So, this will have the greatest impact on your Star Status/Expertise Level.
·Applause Credits: Anything that you upload onto the site can receive applause. This counts towards your score
·Winning submissions: if you work as a writer, the number of winning scenes counts towards your Star Rating.
·Audience Voting: credits for voting elevate your status as an audience member. Different levels carry different weight. If you have achieved a high status as an audience member, your vote could count as 2, 3, 4 etc., votes. In order to be paid royalties as an Audience member you need to achieve a particular level.
·Other elements can affect the rating, like number of fans, winning awards at the Annual Awards ceremony, scripts that get picked up or produced, etc.
50 Script Launch
50 scripts...that sounds ambitious! 
What is life without a little ambition? The goal of 50 scripts is an ideal, but adequate funds would be needed to hire staff sufficient to fully create that many scripts. Also, all scripts wouldn't need to be full-feature productions. There can be trailers, short scripts, etc.
The first goal of the site is to get a script produced by a local theatrical company here in Los Angeles. As one of the goals for users of the site is to get their work picked up and produced, we need to make the first goal of the site the production of a script. In this way we all have a real product in our hands, which provides inspiration.
Of course, the more scripts we have to choose from to produce the better our chances of getting a great production.
We will create special function on the site for the sole purpose of getting that first great script.
We can start the site with 50 script ideas very easily, hiring 25 writers to write 50 loglines, hiring 50 writers to write one, etc. From there we will have people vote on their favorite ideas, which will make it to the second level of actually getting started writing and online production. For example, out of the first 50 script ideas we may narrow that down to the top 25 ideas and then we may have the first 5 scenes made on these. Out of these 25 we may narrow it down to 10 and then get these through the first or second acts. Then out of these 10, after the first or second act, we may narrow that down to the top 3. These may get fully produced on-site, with the community voting on which will make it to off-site, full video production. With sufficient budget we could get more than one produced.
We will have consultants who monitor the scripts and offer estimates on the costs of producing a scene/script so that we can keep the writing in line with the actual budget.
The details above are not set in stone right now and are mostly dependent on budgetary restrictions. We can do a lot more with $1,000,000 than with $125,000, of course!
Different options could include, but are not limited to:
·one Flagship production (a must)
·one low-budget theatrical production
·a one-man stage production
Not all productions have to cost a lot of money. Casa 0101, for example, is a company that specializes in helping writers of all different financial backgrounds. A low-budget production of a stage script could only cost $1,000. This type of production isn't done to try to pack theaters across the county, but to give writers and artists inspiration to see their work actually produced. To hear one's words spoken on a live stage provides a great reward to writers as well as inspiration to the entire community.
Will your script be next?
I would like to see scripts get produced regularly off the site. We could have a quarterly 'winning scripts' that gets voted for production.
My vision is that production companies all over the world can bid on projects. The flow could be:
Every 3 months scripts of various nature are voted upon to get produced. Production companies bid on the projects. You can see reels of other works produced by these companies on the site. The community votes on which bid to accept. After a winning bid is accepted we go into a funding period. This can be done on Indiegogo.com. Upon funding the production company is placed on a schedule to get production completed in a timely manner. Updates to users are required.
A Strict, User-Enforced, No-Negativity Policy
Because creativity flourishes best in a positive, supportive environment, we will create a strict, no-negativity policy that is enforced by users. If you leave a comment that is deemed as ‘not constructive’, other users can flag it. After a certain amount of flags the comment will automatically be removed.
Feedback is only given if it was requested by the artist. If comments are given without request, aside from wholly positive ones, the comment would be removed. If feedback is requested, then your comments should be made in a constructive manner. If you don’t know how to make constructive comments, well, you will learn very quickly! :)
Anyone continually getting flagged for violating the policy can have their account suspended. I don’t anticipate that people will be abusing this policy, however.
Promotion Via MoviesIndeed.com
There will be many opportunities for you to promote yourself and your art via the site. For everything you publish on the site, links will be provided not only to your MoviesIndeed profile but also off-site links to hire you, buy your art/music, speak to you about private lessons, etc.
For example, maybe you have a great band and want to promote your music. You can use your band’s music as the basis of a soundtrack. Links can be provided alongside your soundtrack directly to a site where people can buy your music.
I also plan to draw an alliance with a freelance site like elance.com, odesk.com, freelancer.com. I've hired hundreds of people over the years through these sites. Let's say you're an illustrator, you can have an account at one of these sites with a link to hire you, connected to every illustration you upload.
Script Submission Service
We can have Stephanie Phillips, our professional staff writer, evaluate your privately written script and, if it is of sufficient caliber, have it submitted to agents, managers and producers. Know that we will only take scripts that she feels has a 'shot'. This will not be a service where we take a script, charge you a fee and mail it out. You would need to have your script evaluated and only those that Stephanie feels are of high caliber will be circulated. Stephanie has many contacts in the industry and needs to maintain a reputation, so when she presents a script to someone they will know it's going to be strong.
Other Site Functions To Add:
·A rating system: do you want your script to be G, PG, R, etc.?
·How long do you want a script to be? A 5 min stage production? A 2 min movie trailer? 30 min TV show? A full 90 min feature?
·A platform for different musicians to contribute to a soundtrack. For example, a guitarist uploads a musical segment, timed with a click, which is downloaded by a bass player and bongo player who each adds their parts. The click is taken off and the final product is uploaded to the script. Of course it’s usually best to lay down percussion first for a final track, so the coordination of moving beyond a scratch track is up to the musicians.
·Alongside the logline is a listing of positions needed to fill the script, like 'Foley Artist Needed'. Also listed is the current completion level.
·Upgrade the messaging system so that people can send bulk messages to specific categories of artists. For example, you need an illustrator, so you send a message to all illustrators (who agree to accept bulk messages) asking for someone to join your script
·Input a partially completed script, inviting others to continue from the point you left off.
Did you read all of this? Dang you are interested! The only things left to do are make a contribution and tell your friends. :)
See you soon!
Much love,

<p><span class=""notranslate"">     </span>For each of the last 4 years that I've participated in the breast cancer 3-Day for the Cure 60-mile walk events, I have successfully raised $2,300 to meet my goal.

Komen 3-Day for the Cure.  </p>
<p><br/><span class=""notranslate"">     </span>Interested? See the Perk Levels to the right to help get me started!</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>THINK PINK</em></strong></p>
<p>     Breast cancer awareness fundraising events are held each year all around the country…if you’ve never experienced the pink craziness of a breast cancer event (walk, ride, run, etc) before, well, you might not understand what I mean by “craziness.” </p>
<p>     Close your eyes and imagine pink as far as the eye can see.  Pink pom-poms.  Women wearing bras on top of their t-shirts.  Heck, even MEN wearing bras on top of their t-shirts!  Let’s be honest here, we all love boobs. :)</p>
<p><img alt=""Pink as far as the eye can see..."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i28.photobucket.com/albums/c238/dlwelsh00/DSC02326.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Starting Day 2 of Atlanta Breast Cancer 3-Day 2008""/></p>
<p><em>Pink as far as the eye can see...</em></p>
<p>OK so maybe it’s not your cup of tea, but I assure you, it’s an amazing emotional experience you should try at least once in your life.  This will be my fifth year walking for the cure in various events across the nation (I’ve walked 60 miles in the Susan G. Komen 3-Day for the Cure in Atlanta, San Francisco, Dallas and Tampa Bay)</p>
<p>    <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""> And this year I’ve decided to “cash in” on all that boobie hoopla and set myself up a lemonade-stand style table at events where I’m not participating and sell breast cancer related merchandise to the walkers and supporters. </span></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>THE IDEA </em></strong></p>
<p>In my years as an event participant, I’ve learned two things:</p>
<p>     1. Supporters (walkers, family, friends) are fanatical (read: emotional) about the cure</p>
<p>     2. Walkers young and old all LOVE breast cancer awareness merchandise</p>
<p><img alt=""Me and my walking buddies "" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i28.photobucket.com/albums/c238/dlwelsh00/DSC02565.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""San Francisco 2009""/></p>
<p><em>Me and my walkin' buddies</em></p>
<p>These two things combined led me to a business opportunity…because participants on-site at these events will spend money on unique items to add to their pink collection. </p>
<p>     I know this because I am one of those fanatics!  I’ve racked up quite a collection of scarves, hats, socks, animals, jewelry, and most importantly…BUTTONS!  <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">My plan is to make and sell unique pin-back buttons that speak to attendees at these events.  Anybody from breast cancer survivors to husbands/family/friends/supporters of somebody special battling this terrible disease will find a button that speaks to them. </span></p>
<p><img alt=""(the grey ring border won't be visible in actual button)"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i28.photobucket.com/albums/c238/dlwelsh00/Teathers/buttondesignsamplesforindiegogopage.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""(the grey ring border won't be visible in actual button)""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>THE PLAN</em></strong></p>
<p>I have two main goals for my button project:</p>
<p>     1. Create smiles by offering the perfect breast cancer message</p>
<p>     2. Sell unique buttons like gangbusters!</p>
<p>     Starting summer 2012, I will become the breast-cancer-awareness-button-maker-extraordinaire.  I have researched the costs for a complete button making machine and supplies, created over 60 button designs, and chosen six breast cancer events in and around my home city to travel to and sell these buttons. </p>
<p>     Buttons will be sold in a simple setup similar to a lemonade stand: table and chairs, posters for display, radio with high energy playlist, and candy/snacks for the walkers.  The pricing of the buttons will be comparable (actually cheaper) to breast cancer buttons sold online: 1 button for $3, 4 buttons for $10.  I anticipate that most buttons will be sold in bulk groups for an average price of $2.50 each.</p>
<p>     <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">All that’s left for me to get started is the equipment! With full funding, I will have the ability to make and sell 1,000 buttons at breast cancer events between July and November.</span></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>THE COSTS FOR 1,000 BUTTONS: </em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>    Button maker: $200.00</li>
<li>    Button supplies: $88.00</li>
<li>    Shipping: $65.00</li>
<li>    Circle punch: $127.00</li>
<li>    Printing: $70.00</li>
</ul><p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>THE EVENTS</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><img alt=""Breast Cancer Sales Opportunities"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i28.photobucket.com/albums/c238/dlwelsh00/BCbuttonseventdates.png"" src="""" style=""""/></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: “Can we exceed our goal?”</strong></p>
<p>            A: YES! This would be incredible! Indiegogo will allow me to keep as much money as was given before the deadline.  The goal of $550 will cover the costs of the super-duper-button-making-machine and the parts and pieces to make 1,000 buttons. With additional funding I will be able to a) pay for travel expenses to get to the six events, b) make more than 1,000 buttons, and maybe c) travel to more than six events.   </p>
<p><strong>Q: “What happens if we don’t reach our goal?”</strong></p>
<p>            A: If our goal isn’t met before the deadline, your card isn’t charged, and I'm on my own to accomplish what I've set out here.  I’ve already designed the buttons, created organizer bins to hold my wares, compiled the ‘high energy music playlist’ for event days, and invested in 12 pounds of pink lemonade drink powder to quench participants’ thirst.  I’m so ready – this button-making is going to happen.  Without your help I’ll just have to break into my piggy bank to buy the machine myself.  It won't be the end of the world but let's avoid that, shall we?</p>
<p><strong>Q: “If I can't give a cash donation, are there other ways that I can support your project?”</strong></p>
<p>            A:You bet!  What I most need are cash donations (of any size, big or small), but if you have some creative design ideas and want to share them with me so that I can add them to my design portfolio and use to sell more buttons, that would be great!  I would also appreciate if you would share this campaign with others who would be interested to buy a breast cancer button and/or support in another way.  I really need your help and anything you can offer will be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <strong>Q: “Is my pledge amount publicly displayed?”</strong></p>
<p>            A: <span style=""background-color: white;"">You can choose whether or not you want your name and contribution amount to be displayed on the campaign page under the Funders tab. Choose “Visible"" if you want both your name and amount displayed, “Identity-Only” if you want only your name displayed without your amount, and “Anonymous” if you want only your amount displayed. </span></p>
<p><strong> Q: “What if I don’t want the reward, I just want to support your project?”</strong></p>
<p>            A: There is an option you can select if you don’t want the reward…no problem.</p>
<p><strong>Q: “What is your affiliation with breast cancer fundraising groups?”</strong></p>
<p>            A: I want to see an end to breast cancer, period.  There are many, many worthy fundraising organizations who are working to find the cure and I suggest you do your research if you wish to support one of these organizations directly.  I personally love the Breast Cancer 3-Day events for their intensity and camaraderie.  Plus walking 60 miles in 3 days is hella fun. :)</p>
<p> <strong>Q: “I don’t like boobs so why should I support your project?”</strong></p>
<p>            A: Don't lie, everybody likes boobs. </p>
<p><strong>Q: “Can I give my reward buttons to someone else as a gift?”</strong></p>
<p>            A: Sure, why not? If you would like to support the Buttons for Boobies Project but give your reward to someone as a gift, go through the normal process of making a donation in your name. For billing purposes, this action must be in your name. After our deadline, we will send a message to you through Indiegogo. (It will be forwarded to the email address you provided). We will request things like your custom design or message for buttons and address from you at that time. If you’re giving your reward as a gift and would like it to be mailed directly to him/her, simply include the recipient’s information (and any note you’d like to include). We’ll make sure this special person in your life gets it.</p>
<p><strong>Q:<strong> “Can I increase my pledge once it’s been made? </strong></strong></p>
<p>            A: YES! Once you back our campaign with a pledge amount, you may want to change your reward to a different one, or increase your pledge amount.  Check out the Indiegogo Help Center forum ""How to Upgrade Your Perk"" through the following link:<strong> <br/></strong></p>
<p><a href=""http://support.indiegogo.com/entries/20517401-how-to-upgrade-your-perk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://support.indiegogo.com/entries/20517401-h...</a></p>
<p><strong>Q: “Who does the money go to?”</strong></p>
<p>            A: Every penny (minus the fees for Indiegogo’s involvement) will go directly to the Buttons for Boobies budget – your money goes to the funding of this project to purchase the button maker machine and parts for 1,000 buttons.  With additional funding I will be able to a) pay for travel expenses to get to the six events, b) make more than 1,000 buttons, and maybe c) travel to more than six events.   </p>
<p> <strong>Q: “Are those your real boobs in the video or did you use a breast double?”</strong></p>
<p>            A: No comment.<br/><br/><strong>Q: “I'm not in the US. Can I still pledge to projects?”</strong></p>
<p>            A: Yes. You can pledge from anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Q: “Who is that stoic dog in the video?”</strong></p>
<p>            A: He’s a pretty cool pup, right? It's Bailey, my adopted Black Labrador/Golden Retriever who flunked out of service dog school and now pays for his lavish ball-chasing lifestyle directing full-length films.  We were really excited to get on his busy schedule for this short clip. </p>

     And this year I’ve decided to “cash in” on all that boobie hoopla and set myself up a lemonade-stand style table at events where I’m not participating and sell breast cancer related merchandise to the walkers and supporters. 
 
THE IDEA 
In my years as an event participant, I’ve learned two things:
     1. Supporters (walkers, family, friends) are fanatical (read: emotional) about the cure
     2. Walkers young and old all LOVE breast cancer awareness merchandise

Me and my walkin' buddies
These two things combined led me to a business opportunity…because participants on-site at these events will spend money on unique items to add to their pink collection. 
     I know this because I am one of those fanatics!  I’ve racked up quite a collection of scarves, hats, socks, animals, jewelry, and most importantly…BUTTONS!  My plan is to make and sell unique pin-back buttons that speak to attendees at these events.  Anybody from breast cancer survivors to husbands/family/friends/supporters of somebody special battling this terrible disease will find a button that speaks to them. 

 
THE PLAN
I have two main goals for my button project:
     1. Create smiles by offering the perfect breast cancer message
     2. Sell unique buttons like gangbusters!
     Starting summer 2012, I will become the breast-cancer-awareness-button-maker-extraordinaire.  I have researched the costs for a complete button making machine and supplies, created over 60 button designs, and chosen six breast cancer events in and around my home city to travel to and sell these buttons. 
     Buttons will be sold in a simple setup similar to a lemonade stand: table and chairs, posters for display, radio with high energy playlist, and candy/snacks for the walkers.  The pricing of the buttons will be comparable (actually cheaper) to breast cancer buttons sold online: 1 button for $3, 4 buttons for $10.  I anticipate that most buttons will be sold in bulk groups for an average price of $2.50 each.
     All that’s left for me to get started is the equipment! With full funding, I will have the ability to make and sell 1,000 buttons at breast cancer events between July and November.
 
THE COSTS FOR 1,000 BUTTONS: 

    Button maker: $200.00
    Button supplies: $88.00
    Shipping: $65.00
    Circle punch: $127.00
    Printing: $70.00
 
THE EVENTS

 
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
Q: “Can we exceed our goal?”
            A: YES! This would be incredible! Indiegogo will allow me to keep as much money as was given before the deadline.  The goal of $550 will cover the costs of the super-duper-button-making-machine and the parts and pieces to make 1,000 buttons. With additional funding I will be able to a) pay for travel expenses to get to the six events, b) make more than 1,000 buttons, and maybe c) travel to more than six events.   
Q: “What happens if we don’t reach our goal?”
            A: If our goal isn’t met before the deadline, your card isn’t charged, and I'm on my own to accomplish what I've set out here.  I’ve already designed the buttons, created organizer bins to hold my wares, compiled the ‘high energy music playlist’ for event days, and invested in 12 pounds of pink lemonade drink powder to quench participants’ thirst.  I’m so ready – this button-making is going to happen.  Without your help I’ll just have to break into my piggy bank to buy the machine myself.  It won't be the end of the world but let's avoid that, shall we?
Q: “If I can't give a cash donation, are there other ways that I can support your project?”
            A:You bet!  What I most need are cash donations (of any size, big or small), but if you have some creative design ideas and want to share them with me so that I can add them to my design portfolio and use to sell more buttons, that would be great!  I would also appreciate if you would share this campaign with others who would be interested to buy a breast cancer button and/or support in another way.  I really need your help and anything you can offer will be greatly appreciated!
 
 Q: “Is my pledge amount publicly displayed?”
            A: You can choose whether or not you want your name and contribution amount to be displayed on the campaign page under the Funders tab. Choose “Visible"" if you want both your name and amount displayed, “Identity-Only” if you want only your name displayed without your amount, and “Anonymous” if you want only your amount displayed. 
 Q: “What if I don’t want the reward, I just want to support your project?”
            A: There is an option you can select if you don’t want the reward…no problem.
Q: “What is your affiliation with breast cancer fundraising groups?”
            A: I want to see an end to breast cancer, period.  There are many, many worthy fundraising organizations who are working to find the cure and I suggest you do your research if you wish to support one of these organizations directly.  I personally love the Breast Cancer 3-Day events for their intensity and camaraderie.  Plus walking 60 miles in 3 days is hella fun. :)
 Q: “I don’t like boobs so why should I support your project?”
            A: Don't lie, everybody likes boobs. 
Q: “Can I give my reward buttons to someone else as a gift?”
            A: Sure, why not? If you would like to support the Buttons for Boobies Project but give your reward to someone as a gift, go through the normal process of making a donation in your name. For billing purposes, this action must be in your name. After our deadline, we will send a message to you through Indiegogo. (It will be forwarded to the email address you provided). We will request things like your custom design or message for buttons and address from you at that time. If you’re giving your reward as a gift and would like it to be mailed directly to him/her, simply include the recipient’s information (and any note you’d like to include). We’ll make sure this special person in your life gets it.
Q: “Can I increase my pledge once it’s been made? 
            A: YES! Once you back our campaign with a pledge amount, you may want to change your reward to a different one, or increase your pledge amount.  Check out the Indiegogo Help Center forum ""How to Upgrade Your Perk"" through the following link: 
http://support.indiegogo.com/entries/20517401-h...
Q: “Who does the money go to?”
            A: Every penny (minus the fees for Indiegogo’s involvement) will go directly to the Buttons for Boobies budget – your money goes to the funding of this project to purchase the button maker machine and parts for 1,000 buttons.  With additional funding I will be able to a) pay for travel expenses to get to the six events, b) make more than 1,000 buttons, and maybe c) travel to more than six events.   
 Q: “Are those your real boobs in the video or did you use a breast double?”
            A: No comment.Q: “I'm not in the US. Can I still pledge to projects?”
            A: Yes. You can pledge from anywhere.
Q: “Who is that stoic dog in the video?”
            A: He’s a pretty cool pup, right? It's Bailey, my adopted Black Labrador/Golden Retriever who flunked out of service dog school and now pays for his lavish ball-chasing lifestyle directing full-length films.  We were really excited to get on his busy schedule for this short clip.

We are currently an apparel company for the extreme sports industry. However we want to expand into hard goods so that we can have an impact on the performance of athletes in the industry. We feel that goggles are a great place to start, but since we're limited with funds, we couldn't get very good ones. And that just won't do. We want to become a leading brand in the extreme sports industry, and high quality products are the only way to get there. We are very serious for our age, and recently won the Junior Dragons Den business competition in our home town. This has made product expansion a reality for our company, but we're still a little short on funds if we want high quality goggles for this ski / snowboard season, and still fund our other projects related to the company.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; Why</h3>
<div>If reached, the $700 goal amount allows us to get our first order of high quality polarized goggles. The anti-fog, anti-scratch, and anti-glare of these goggles will certainly be an asset for consumers. When its competition time, sun glare can make or break your run. Vision is everything, and why compromise it when you don't have to? We hope to provide a product that is the solution to this problem. Which will grow our brand reputability, and give athletes a product that allows them to perform their best,  in a cool sleek design that compares or outclasses other products on the market.</div>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Your contributions will allow our company to expand at a quicker rate. We're very small and just started off, but we really think Ebon Supply Co. could go somewhere. As students, we would like to see this be what we do for the rest of our lives. The expansion could propel our brand to the track of success.

<p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Q: I haven't received any survey yet! When and where

update to the email address with which you log in to your Indiegogo
account. Anyhow, it is possible that it may have been caught by the SPAM

Look for the email address: </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">""</span><a href=""mailto:noreply@protonet.info"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""background-color: initial;"">noreply@protonet.info</a><span style=""background-color: initial;""> via </span><a href=""http://surveymonkey.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""background-color: initial;"">surveymonkey.com</a><span style=""background-color: initial;"">""</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> (</span><a href=""mailto:member@surveymonkey.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""background-color: initial;"">member@surveymonkey.com</a><span style=""background-color: initial;"">)</span></p>
<p><b>Q: I don't have a PayPal account, how can I receive
the funds?</b><br/>
A: You can create a new PayPal Account for free, and you don't need to create
one before filling out the refund-request survey. Alternatively, as a EU-
(SEPA) or US-Based contributor you'll have the choice to get the funds over a
bank transfer. We don't expect any transaction charges within these economic
regions.</p>
<p><b>Q: Do I need to do anything when I receive the PayPal
payment?</b><br/>
A: YES, ACTION NEEDED! You'll have 30 days to accept the payment, so that the
funds get allocated to your PayPal account. The funds will be transferred back
to us if you don't take action within 30 days after you receive the payPal
transfer notification. In case that happens, we'll send you an email to clarify
the situation.</p>
<p><b>Q: How long will it take until all funds have been
refunded?</b><br/>
A: We will only refund contributors, who fill out the survey, as we don't want
to blindly send funds over PayPal without knowing the contributor's payment
preference.</p>
<p><b>Q: Can I initiate a chargeback with my credit card
provider or a dispute in PayPal to get the funds back?</b><br/>
A: Please don't try that, as it would only complicate the process. That said,
credit card chargebacks can only be initiated 120 days after the transaction.
PayPal transactions can only be disputed 45 days after the funds have been
collected. We expect some frustration in this aspect, but please trust us.</p>
<p><b>Q: Is there a way I can get a bank transfer, and avoid
the PayPal acceptance fees?</b><br/>
A: As a EU- (SEPA) or US-Based contributor you'll have the choice to get the
funds over a bank transfer. We don't expect any transaction charges within
these economic regions. If you're based anywhere else in the world, but you do
have a EU-(SEPA) or US-based bank account, please send us a direct message over
Indiegogo. Simply click on “ask a question” when you scroll up, just next
to my profile picture on the campaign page. We'll get back to you in no time.</p>
<p><b>Q: What happens if a contributor doesn't answer the
refund-request survey?</b><br/>
A: We'll send out the survey to all contributors just after announcing the
refund. After that we will send weekly reminders to all contributors, who haven't
filled out the refund-request. After four reminders, we'll send out the funds
over PayPal to the contributor's Indiegogo email address. Contributors then
have 30 days to accept the PayPal payment. If the contributor also fails to
accept the payment within the 30 days, the funds will be automatically
transferred back to our PayPal account. Contributors who fail to get the refund
within our process can get in touch with us through a direct message over
Indiegogo. Simply click on “ask a question” when you scroll up, just next to my
profile picture on the campaign page.</p>
<p><b>Q: When will a new ZOE Campaign launch?</b><br/>
A: ZOE is alive and we'll keep on working on getting her to market. At
this time, there is no way we can give a reliable timeline, but we will send all
our current contributors an email with a special discount for when we re-launch
ZOE. You can also subscribe here if you want to have ZOE-news and make
sure you stay in the loop.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q: I don't want to get a refund. I'm used to delays in
crowd funding campaigns and I'd be happy to wait until you deliver some day.</b><br/>
A: Please accept our refund. Due to the delay, we'll be able to integrate
learnings we got over this campaign. The re-launched ZOE will have different
specifications and pricing.</p>
<p><b>Q: What's the partner's name?</b><br/>
A: We're not in liberty to communicate that, as it would reduce the future
impact at the re-launch of ZOE. We know our partner has very good reasons to
postpone his cooperation with us and we respect that.</p>
<p><b>Q: I contributed multiple times, will I receive the
funds in multiple transactions?</b><br/>
A: We will consolidate the funds of contributors who contributed multiple times
into one transaction.</p>
<p><b>Q: Can you please share the security in place to protect my information?</b><br/>A: We’ve taken extra cautionary measures, so that our survey can’t be hacked. Our company is strong in the data security aspect of the internet, and you can trust we know this, as it’s one of our core competences. We will also delete all content from the refund-requests as soon as we send out the funds.</p>
<p><b>Q: Wasn't this just an interest free loan for
you?</b><br/>
A: We spent a lot of time, money and tears on the development of ZOE, creation
of the video and managing the campaign. On top of that we paid around 10% for
Indiegogo and payment provider fees. So you can believe us if we say this
wasn't such an awesome ""loan"".</p>
<p><b>Q: I already received the Protonet Business Server,
what happens to me?</b><br/>
A: You'll receive a refund of the campaign value of the ZOE and Voicedrop
perks.</p>

Refund FAQ -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Q: Why isn’t Indiegogo handling the refund, as in other crowdfunding campaigns I’ve backed?A: Opposite to Kickstarter, Indiegogo doesn’t offer any portal for refunding Contributors. The best option they recommended was using PayPal for this. We went one step further and added the possibility to get the refund over a bank transfer in the EU (SEPA) and US, as that circumvents the transaction fees of PayPal.
Q: I haven't received any survey yet! When and where
will I get it?A: We'll be sending out the refund-survey just after we post this
update to the email address with which you log in to your Indiegogo

<h3>Our Story</h3> <p></p>
<p>Tesmaraneh is the result of a dream of a Sierra Leonean who was fortunate to go to school, even though her mum never got that opportunity. Her vision was to see education as a right for all African girls instead of an opportunity. She decided to use fashion to support her dreams. Isatu and her team are now working assiduously to make this dream a reality, and they are now looking for funds to launch their first major production and first line . They are highly educated professionals in various subjects who want to make a change for local tailors and girls education in Sierra Leone, West Africa.</p>

Apart from a sense of pride & self satisfaction of doing your bit in educating girls,
you get a great piece of apparel. A hand-made apparel with superior fabric that the people of Ghana have worn for centuries. Of course we understand that raising $27,740 is no child's play, but rest assured, whatever amount of funds that we are able to raise, it will all go towards providing you a great apparel and funding girls education in Sierra Leone. We may not be able to sponsor education for 100 girls, but we will still strive to sponsor school for the maximum girls possible, even 5 or 10. Or even 2 girls. We will bring the change together. 




   The Impact A few dollars would not bring a change to your life, but imagine What change it would bring to the life of less fortunate girls in Sierra Leone:  A girl somewhere in the interior part of Sierra Leone will get books to study in school. A girl who had to dropout from school because of teenage pregnancy & poverty can go back to school. A tailor who was oppressed now has a new life to look to, a life where they and their family can have basic needs.
And of course you would help us showcase the best of Sierra Leone and Ghana 

   Help us Get Started  After months
of planning,
analyzing, designing, we are finally
ready to bring Tesmaraneh to you. We need your
help to fund our initial Production. In return for your support, we are offering a discounted price and a special token of love from the Tesmaraneh Team.

<p><strong>HOW WAYRE BEGAN</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It all started when a beloved pale blue dress worn all over the globe was lost in Seville, Spain After searching high &amp; low for a replacement and three years of returns, we knew we had to create our own.</li>
<li>At wayre, we believe travel is not just a hobby, but a lifestyle. There aren’t many other things in life that bring the same freeing joy as pulling up to a new city ready to explore it or the thrill of communicating in a new language.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>THE DILEMMA</strong></p>
<ul><li>But we also know, travel isn’t always as glamorous as we would like it to be. Packing can be a hassle with all the ‘unexpecteds’ we try to plan for. “What will we be doing? What will the weather be like? What if I‘m under-dressed?” <i>That’s where we come in. </i>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>OUR FIX</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>wayre has created a three-piece wardrobe that addresses the realities of travel. She's silky soft, spill-proof, stank-proof &amp; made to be repeated.</li>
<li>She's responsibly-made and designed to go as far as you do ? No more packing anxiety, questionable outfit choices, or overweight luggage. With wayre, you'll be ready for the highly anticipated, like your tour of La Sagrada Familia, while welcoming the entirely unexpected, like that cute Italian boy.</li>

A shoe that’s comfortable, sustainable and stylish. Made to be your everyday companion for your feet

We started Coby with the mission to make a shoe that could improve your everyday life. With a long lasting relationship with Wool (our grandfather was a wool specialist) we developed a magical fabric that has incredible inner properties for our feet. Made from high-quality Merino Wool, and with our Softknit technology, we have been able to create a remarkable shoe that combines comfort, style and sustainability.

A Classic Design and our SoftKnit fabric; incredibly comfortable, moisture wicking, breathable, odor-reducing, lightweight and machine washable Merino Wool


You can wear them with or without socks


A fabric that repels water naturally

 
 



 
We source Merino Wool from sustainable and fair trade audited farms. We then knit the fibers in a small family-owned mill in Italy, resulting in our unique and super comfortable fabric. We have been able to develop along our Italian partners the SoftKnit technology, which has a structure resistant enough for footwear while, at the same time, add incredible properties Merino has naturally.

 

 


 




 
 
 
 
 

Full Sizes - If you typically wear a full size, we recommend the same size for the best possible fit and comfort.
Half Sizes - If you typically wear ½ sizes, we recommend sizing up for a more relaxed fit or sizing down for a snug fit.
Here's how you can measure for the right fit

With our Coby Awel Move, you'll receive our exclusive #shoesforgood bag

hydrophobic application works by modifying the 100% Egyptian cotton fabric at a molecular level by attaching microscopic ‘whiskers’ to individual fibres which elevate liquids, causing them to bead up and roll off the fabric surface.We apply this technology into our fabric at the fibre level and not just as a coating. It has no effect on comfort or breathability which means a longer lasting shirt.The fabric repels liquids and stains and like the lotus flower does in nature by minimizing the adhesion of the fabric's surface. How we need your helpOur stain resistant shirts are made with some of the most advanced and most expensive fabrics on the market. Selling our shirts through traditional retailers with normal markup would require us to sell at a very high price. We wanted to democratize these technologies and launch our shirts at an affordable price.Crowdfunding provides an amazing platform to bring our products directly to customers at a low price that cannot be found anywhere else. All the funds we raise on Indiegogo will be injected into the manufacturing of our shirts, introducing new colors, and in the development of new groundbreaking products. A win-win for everyone!So please back our campaign and share this on social media. We thank you for your support and can't wait to serve you!Available ColorsThis shirt is available in white, blue or gingham.

You're going to witness the birth of Gnomon - the historical timepiece. We call it historical since it's inspired with the history of the time itself. Gnomon's design is based on appearance of ancient sundials and strives to integrate a well-known idea into contemporary style.The great news are that the Gnomon watches are already produced and ready for shipping immediately after ordering! You can still get your Gnomon watches here on Indiegogo with the special price.The Gnomon timepiece features an authentic outlook recreating Roman classic sundials and a single handed time telling system, referring to an actual gnomon which is reflected in the name of the watch. These timepiece and campaign both are the test of our skill and ambitions through which we want to develop a strong brand with individuality in our signature watches. Below you can learn even more interesting things about Gnomon and view spectacular photos of the first prototypes. Hope you'll like it! The idea to create Gnomon was born from a passion of researching craftsmanship of watchmaking and the history of timepieces itself. Our very small but talented team was drown together by this goal and we started to work on the project in 2016.We wanted to recreate one of the most vital and interesting ways to tell the time in design of a modern sophisticated wristwatch. We had several crucial points in mind that we wanted to incarnate in the watch - authenticity, uniqueness, high quality, reliability and a reasonable price.Gnomon boasts several cool and unique design elements that make it a valuable addition to the wristwatch industry as well as some handicraft parts and an automatic Japanese made movement. It may seems difficult to tell the time by Gnomon, but it's pretty easy! There are two layers with markings. The inner layer offers several indexes to get a full picture of the current time: full hour indexes have corresponding hour numbers and placed in a conventional way and separated by volumetric half hour indexes and small 10-minute indexes. After some practice you'll be feeling yourself comfortable in telling the time with precision even in 10-minute intervals!The outer layer serves both as a supportive tool and as an aesthetic feature.

Our hand is the representation of a gnomon's shadow, slowly circling through the dial as it was meant in the ancient times.We wanted to express this kind of leisure time telling, when a timepiece serves not only as an usual timekeeping tool but also a meditative accessoire which brings you to those ancient days when time hadn't been gradated evenly yet and people used to plan their time subconsciously without any haste.While looking at Gnomon you won't be running after every second.

Our jewelry is handmade in either Zoe's Portland studio or Ashley's Brooklyn studio; we use castings of animal bones and parts in sterling silver and brass to make adornments that are ""where the dark and the beautiful collide."" We recently had an unfortunate event where our casting vendor was careless and didn't store or use our jewelry molds properly. <u>Over 75 of our original molds are completely destroyed and this puts our business at a near standstill</u>.

<p>To make our jewelry designs, we do a process called Lost Wax Casting. We find our natural specimens, such as small animal skulls and bones, and then make molds of them so we can create consistent multiples. </p>
<p>Our molds are injected with wax, and the specimens are ""pulled"" from these molds. These are then put in a casting flask, and filled with plaster which hardens around them. The wax is then heated and melted out of the plaster, thus “lost wax”. Negative impressions of our pieces are left behind, and filled with molten metal to create these multiples in sterling silver or brass.</p>
<p>As you can see, our entire business hinges on having reliable, usable molds. We value our work and only want to produce the best quality designs possible. In order to do so, we need to re-make our molds which takes time and money. We need to purchase new mold material, see which pieces can be remolded from wax or metal castings we still have on hand, but if the options aren't good enough we might have to source new specimens to match our original ones as closely as possible. </p>
<p>Any value raised beyond our goal will benefit our next collection, which is ocean inspired and nearly ready to be finalized.</p>

<p>We, Zoe Cope and Ashley Lagasse, met while in a small metals casting class at the Academy of Art University. After realizing each of us had a box of dead things in our lockers, we figured we should probably be friends. As the semester progressed, many of our molds had a similar aesthetic, as that they were almost always of different animal bones and parts. Both of us were usually at the school studio until it closed and the idea of creating a collection together happened organically. Forged in burns, hammered fingers, accidentally melted silver, and late night pizza runs, our budding jewelry skills and friendship grew over four years.</p>
<p>We officially launched Birds N Bones Jewelry on Halloween 2013 and since then our brand has grown to include four collections and over 100 designs. We handmake each piece, use recycled silver, ethically sourced gemstones, and donate a portion of our monthly earning to different environmental and animal conversation programs. Nature is our biggest inspiration and we care for her and her creatures just as much as we do about creating beautiful, everlasting, unique jewelry.</p>

We’re back! It took 1 year, but we finally cracked how to engineer pique polo shirts and t-shirts that make it easier than ever to dress stylish without compromising on comfort.The outside repels stains, while the inside is anti-bacterial and odour repellent.  Pique is an amazing fabric. The pique polo was invented in the thirties by French tennis champion René Lacoste, and it is one of the most breathable and luxurious fabric constructions.Through extensive research and prototyping we have created a unique treatment mix called FreshCore™. By manipulating cotton fibers we shield them from both bacteria and liquids. Our treatments do not affect the hand feel of the fabric and we are able to reach the same level of breathability than any untreated cotton polo in the market.  Repels all water-based stains, including red wine, beetroot juice, and coffee. Odour and sweat repellent, keeping you fresh all day and beyond. Choose from grey, light blue, white and navy.Don't take our word for it.

Et les vêtements là-dedans, me direz-vous? C’est difficile de se sentir puissante quand nos vêtements ne nous vont pas. Les manches trop courtes, les robes et les jupes qui ont toujours l’air de mini-jupe. Ils ne sont jamais assez longs pour nos bras et nos jambes! Sans oublier le classique des pantalons trop court! Avoir la cheville à l’air l’hiver, ce n’est pas agréable!</p><p>Je veux offrir la possibilité aux grandes de s’habiller comme elles le désirent. Leurs donner le choix d’avoir des vêtements différents et stylisés. Qu’elles se tiennent droites et grandes pour se dépasser.</p><p><strong>Mon histoire: À la grandeur de mes ambitions!</strong></p><p>Je suis une grande femme. Laisse-moi te dire à quel point c’est difficile de se vêtir lorsque ton gabarit n’est pas dans les « normes ». Je le connais ce sentiment lorsque tu portes les créations faites par ta mère et que tu détonnes des autres ! À cette époque, je n’aimais pas ça. J’en n’avais pas du « vrai linge » pis dans le fond, je voulais juste être comme les autres. C’est légitime pour une adolescente, non ?</p><p>Je m’appelle Sabrina Beaulieu et je viens d’une famille qui adore et excelle en couture. La complexité de trouver des vêtements post premier enfant m’a amené à prendre des cours pour me fabriquer mes propres morceaux. Je suis littéralement tombé en amour car j’aime choisir les patrons, les tissus ainsi que les couper et les coudre.</p><p>J’ai toujours aimé dessiner. Partout, tout le temps. Des esquisses, j’en ai fait ! Mais à force de croire qu’il « fallait être mince » pour créer des vêtements, je me suis rabattu sur l’architecture. Je suis technologue en architecture et j’ai mon entreprise avec mon conjoint depuis 2008. Est-ce que j’étais complètement heureuse ? Non. Je devais me rendre à l’évidence, ma mission de vie n’était pas celle que je croyais. En dedans, ce qui me fait vibrer, c’est d’aider les filles comme moi à se sentir bien et en pouvoir de leur corps grâce à des vêtements qui leur donnent un look du tonnerre. Je souhaite qu’elles soient fières de leur 5’10"" et plus ! Par ma persévérance, mon naturel joyeux et positif, je désire inspirer ces femmes à s’aimer comme elles sont, belles chacune à leur façon.</p><p>Donc après plusieurs montagnes russes d’appréhensions et d’incertitudes, je décide enfin de me lancer dans cette aventure d’affaire et ainsi est née: La Grande — Maison de couture!</p><p>Avec moi comme partenaire de votre garde-robe, vous vous sentirez comme chez une amie. Sans jugement. Je serais là pour vous supporter dans le choix d’être qui vous voulez vraiment. La Grande – Maison de couture, c’est plus que des vêtements, c’est l’intention de changer les standards.</p><p><strong>Par qui et où est créé la collection?</strong></p><p>La collection est créée au Québec. Le design est dessiné par moi, Sabrina Beaulieu; la grande princesse guerrière orc!</p><p>J’ai une patronniste qui a créé le premier modèle que je vous présente ici. La collection sera crée par plusieurs patronnistes de mon choix.</p><p>Les mannequins que vous voyez sont des amies qui me soutiennent et qui ont embarquées à 100% dans ce magnifique projet.</p><p>Le but de choisir des gens près de chez moi est de redonner à la communauté. Un jour, j’aimerais avoir mon propre atelier avec une grande équipe à deux pas de chez moi.</p><p><strong>Qui peut acheter les produits La Grande?</strong></p><p>Si vous êtes trop grandes pour les boutiques régulières, vous êtes la cliente parfaite pour nos produits!</p><p>Dans un souci de diversité et d’inclusivité, les tailles offertes vont de 6 à 28 (S à 3X). Si ces tailles ne vous conviennent pas, contacter moi car mon but est d'habiller TOUTES les grandes!</p><p>Idem pour les longueurs de pantalon qui vont de 34"" à 41"" d'entrejambes!</p><p>Parce que nous sommes #GRANDEMENTPARFAITE</p><p><strong>À quoi va servir l’argent du socio-financement?</strong></p><p>Cet argent va servir à créer et développer d’autres morceaux de vêtements pour la première collection. 15 pièces au total. Le lancement prévu le 1<sup>er</sup> octobre 2020!</p><p>Qu’est-ce ça inclus :</p><ul>
<li>Conception des vêtements : Recherche, dessins des modèles, création et développement du patron, ainsi que la gradation des tailles.</li>
<li>Choix des matériaux : Tissus, mercerie (boutons, fils, fermeture éclair), doublure</li>
<li>Test : Création des échantillons pour s’assurer de l’ajustement sur des vraies personnes. Plusieurs échantillons seront nécessaires pour chaque morceau.</li>
<li>Photoshoot : Parce que j’ai hâte de vous montrer ça!</li>
<li>Site internet complet : Voir la description ici-bas</li>
</ul><p>Elle servir également à la création du site web <a href=""http://www.lagrande.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.lagrande.ca</a>. Ce ne sera pas juste un site de vente! Je veux créer une plateforme où vous pourrez échanger sur vos problématiques de grandes sous la forme d’un forum.</p><p>J'ai également l'intention de créer une section blog! Le Grand Blog! Écrit par des grandes pour des grandes!</p><p>J’ai envie que La Grandes – Maison de couture devienne une communauté pour nous les grandes. Un endroit où l'on peut se rassembler.</p><p><strong>Mon engagement envers vous.</strong></p><p>Je m’engage de tout faire en mon pouvoir pour vous offrir un produit de qualité que vous allez adorer porter.</p><p>Créer des vêtements qui vous feront sentir encore plus grandes!</p><p><strong>Les tailles</strong></p><p>Tel que mentionné précédemment, j’offre toutes les tailles entre 6 et 28. La particularité est qu’elles ne sont pas écrites dans les vêtements. Exemple, la taille 14=ardente/fiery. Donc vos mesures sont la seule vérité!

<p><strong>Why did I create this line for tall women?</strong></p>
<p>I wish to encourage tall women to feel great enough to grow even more! You might be thinking, “what do clothes have to do with all of this?” It’s hard to feel powerful when our clothes don’t fit us. Sleeves too short, dresses and skirts that always look like miniskirts… These clothes are never long enough for our arms and legs! And don’t forget the classic problem with our pants being too short! Having bare ankles during the wintertime isn’t exactly pleasant!</p>
<p>I want to offer the tall ladies the possibilities to get dressed as they desire. To give them the choice to own different clothes in different styles. To see them stand tall and proud to better themselves.</p>
<p><strong>My story: The greatness of my ambitions!</strong></p>
<p>I am a tall woman. Let me tell you how hard it can be difficult to dress up when your frame is not within the usual “standards.” I know it too well this feeling when you wear creations sewn by your mother and you do not fit in the crowd! Back then, I did not like it. I did not have any “real clothes” and after all, I simply want to be like everyone else. Which is quite legitimate for a teen, no?</p>
<p>My name is Sabrina Beaulieu and I come from a family that loves and excels in sewing. The complexity to find clothes following a first child brought me to take classes to fashion my own pieces of clothing. I literally fell in love and I adore choosing the patterns, the materials as well as cutting and sewing.</p>
<p>I always did love to draw. Everywhere, all the time. I did many so many sketcher! But I believe so hard once had to be thin to create clothes, I finally turned to architecture. I am an architectural technologist and I own my business alongside my spouse since 2008. Was I completely happy? No. I had to accept, my life mission was not the one I had thought. Within me, what really was vibrating, was to help girls like me to feel good and in control of their body with stunning-looking clothes. I wish for them to stand proudly from their 5 feet 10 inches, or even more! With perseverance, my joyful and positive nature, I want to inspire these women to love themselves as they are, beautiful all in their own ways.</p>
<p>So after a roller coaster of uncertainty and misgivings, I decided finally to jump in the adventure and get into business from which was born: La grande — Maison de couture !</p>
<p>With myself as a partner of your wardrobe, you will feel just like at a friend’s home. No judgment. I will be there to support you in your choice to simply be whom you truly want to be. La Grande—Maison de couture, it is more than just clothing, it is the intent to change the standards.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>By whom and where is created the collection?</strong></p>
<p>The collection is created in Quebec. The design comes from sketches I do, me, Sabrina Beaulieu; the orcish warrior princess!</p>

Et les vêtements là-dedans, me direz-vous? C’est difficile de se sentir puissante quand nos vêtements ne nous vont pas. Les manches trop courtes, les robes et les jupes qui ont toujours l’air de mini-jupe. Ils ne sont jamais assez longs pour nos bras et nos jambes! Sans oublier le classique des pantalons trop court! Avoir la cheville à l’air l’hiver, ce n’est pas agréable!Je veux offrir la possibilité aux grandes de s’habiller comme elles le désirent. Leurs donner le choix d’avoir des vêtements différents et stylisés. Qu’elles se tiennent droites et grandes pour se dépasser.Mon histoire: À la grandeur de mes ambitions!Je suis une grande femme. Laisse-moi te dire à quel point c’est difficile de se vêtir lorsque ton gabarit n’est pas dans les « normes ». Je le connais ce sentiment lorsque tu portes les créations faites par ta mère et que tu détonnes des autres ! À cette époque, je n’aimais pas ça. J’en n’avais pas du « vrai linge » pis dans le fond, je voulais juste être comme les autres. C’est légitime pour une adolescente, non ?Je m’appelle Sabrina Beaulieu et je viens d’une famille qui adore et excelle en couture. La complexité de trouver des vêtements post premier enfant m’a amené à prendre des cours pour me fabriquer mes propres morceaux. Je suis littéralement tombé en amour car j’aime choisir les patrons, les tissus ainsi que les couper et les coudre.J’ai toujours aimé dessiner. Partout, tout le temps. Des esquisses, j’en ai fait ! Mais à force de croire qu’il « fallait être mince » pour créer des vêtements, je me suis rabattu sur l’architecture. Je suis technologue en architecture et j’ai mon entreprise avec mon conjoint depuis 2008. Est-ce que j’étais complètement heureuse ? Non. Je devais me rendre à l’évidence, ma mission de vie n’était pas celle que je croyais. En dedans, ce qui me fait vibrer, c’est d’aider les filles comme moi à se sentir bien et en pouvoir de leur corps grâce à des vêtements qui leur donnent un look du tonnerre. Je souhaite qu’elles soient fières de leur 5’10"" et plus ! Par ma persévérance, mon naturel joyeux et positif, je désire inspirer ces femmes à s’aimer comme elles sont, belles chacune à leur façon.Donc après plusieurs montagnes russes d’appréhensions et d’incertitudes, je décide enfin de me lancer dans cette aventure d’affaire et ainsi est née: La Grande — Maison de couture!Avec moi comme partenaire de votre garde-robe, vous vous sentirez comme chez une amie. Sans jugement. Je serais là pour vous supporter dans le choix d’être qui vous voulez vraiment.

Le design est dessiné par moi, Sabrina Beaulieu; la grande princesse guerrière orc!J’ai une patronniste qui a créé le premier modèle que je vous présente ici. La collection sera crée par plusieurs patronnistes de mon choix.Les mannequins que vous voyez sont des amies qui me soutiennent et qui ont embarquées à 100% dans ce magnifique projet.Le but de choisir des gens près de chez moi est de redonner à la communauté.

Version anglaise/englishversion:
Why did I create this line for tall women?
I wish to encourage tall women to feel great enough to grow even more! You might be thinking, “what do clothes have to do with all of this?” It’s hard to feel powerful when our clothes don’t fit us. Sleeves too short, dresses and skirts that always look like miniskirts… These clothes are never long enough for our arms and legs! And don’t forget the classic problem with our pants being too short! Having bare ankles during the wintertime isn’t exactly pleasant!
I want to offer the tall ladies the possibilities to get dressed as they desire. To give them the choice to own different clothes in different styles. To see them stand tall and proud to better themselves.
My story: The greatness of my ambitions!
I am a tall woman. Let me tell you how hard it can be difficult to dress up when your frame is not within the usual “standards.” I know it too well this feeling when you wear creations sewn by your mother and you do not fit in the crowd! Back then, I did not like it. I did not have any “real clothes” and after all, I simply want to be like everyone else. Which is quite legitimate for a teen, no?
My name is Sabrina Beaulieu and I come from a family that loves and excels in sewing. The complexity to find clothes following a first child brought me to take classes to fashion my own pieces of clothing. I literally fell in love and I adore choosing the patterns, the materials as well as cutting and sewing.
I always did love to draw. Everywhere, all the time. I did many so many sketcher! But I believe so hard once had to be thin to create clothes, I finally turned to architecture. I am an architectural technologist and I own my business alongside my spouse since 2008. Was I completely happy? No. I had to accept, my life mission was not the one I had thought. Within me, what really was vibrating, was to help girls like me to feel good and in control of their body with stunning-looking clothes. I wish for them to stand proudly from their 5 feet 10 inches, or even more! With perseverance, my joyful and positive nature, I want to inspire these women to love themselves as they are, beautiful all in their own ways.
So after a roller coaster of uncertainty and misgivings, I decided finally to jump in the adventure and get into business from which was born: La grande — Maison de couture !
With myself as a partner of your wardrobe, you will feel just like at a friend’s home. No judgment. I will be there to support you in your choice to simply be whom you truly want to be. La Grande—Maison de couture, it is more than just clothing, it is the intent to change the standards.
 
By whom and where is created the collection?
The collection is created in Quebec. The design comes from sketches I do, me, Sabrina Beaulieu; the orcish warrior princess!
I do have a pattern maker that created the first model that I present to you here. The whole collection will be created with multiple pattern makers that I will select personally.
The whole manufacturing will be done in Quebec by seamstress by trade.
The models you see are all friends that support me and are 100% on board with me in this grand project.  
The objective in choosing people in proximity is so that I can give back to my community. One day, I dream to own my own shop with a full team within only a few steps from my home.
Who can purchase products from La Grande?
If you are too tall for the regular boutiques, you are the perfect customer for our products!
In the interest of making sure we offer diversity and inclusion, the sizes go from 6 to 28 (small to 3X-Large). If these sizes do not suit you, please do contact me as my goal is to dress ALL of the tall women!
Same goes for the inseam length that go from 34 inches to 41 inches.
Because we are #HIGHLYPERFECT.
To which means will the money from the social-funding be applied?
The funding will help created and developpe other pieces of clothings for the first collection. We are aiming for a total of 15 pieces. The launch is schedule for Octobre 1st, 2020!
What does this include :

Conception of the clothes : research, drawings of models, creation and development of patterns, as well as the sizes grading.
Material choice: fabrics, haberdashery (buttons, zippers and threads) and garment lining.
Testing: Production of samples to see to the required adjustments on real persons. Multiple samples are required for each piece.
A photoshoot: because I cannot wait to show you all this!
A complete web site: See description here below.

 
It will serve as well for the élaboration of the web site www.lagrande.ca. Which will not only be a sale shop! I am hoping to create a forum plateform where women can come to exchange in regards to their personal and various issues related to their size.
I also have the intent to create a blog! The Grand Blog! Written by Tall women for the tall ones.
I am really hoping to see La Grande – Maison de couture become a community for all of us tall women. A place to gather and to simply be.

They do everything with us. And when winter rolls around, there is no stopping them. Winter dog jackets need to be easy to get on, keep your dog warm and active, and last a lifetime. The jacket you wear in the winter is all of these things, why shouldn't your dog's be?</p><p>Getting your dog into a winter jacket when he is excited to get outside can be a challenge. Most jackets require your dog to lift his legs and awkwardly fit them through holes that may not properly fit. Chest sizes vary dramatically from breed to breed and make picking the right size difficult. And then, when you finally find a jacket that sort of works, it only lasts a season or two and then you have to do it all over again.</p><p>It doesn't have to be this way.</p><p>That's why we designed the 5-Second Dog Parka. The world's easiest and fastest fitting winter dog jacket.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-pin-nopin=""true"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485215791/ilgppxnugw0xnhpb4qwj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/>Dog jackets on the market today are not designed with your pup in mind. They are modified human coats and require your dog to lift his legs into arm holes and button or zip up the chest - movements that can be an issue for senior dogs, easily distracted puppies, or any high energy dog raring to get outside and explore.</p><p>Our design was the result of many prototypes and a year of testing. We wanted to design a jacket that had very few moving parts but still have the ability to be adaptable.</p><p>With a self adjusting neck, one clip, and Velcro sides, the 5-Second Dog Parka is the easiest fitting jacket you'll ever put on your dog. Simply follow these steps:</p><ul>
<li>Slide the parka over your pup's head</li>
<li>Adjust the midsection clip</li>
<li>Smooth out the Velcro sides - you're done!</li>
</ul><p><img class=""lazy"" data-pin-nopin=""true"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485215812/nty2nllnmodlbxgcr21n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/> </p><p>Sizing? No problem.</p><p>How many times have you torn your hair out trying to figure out what size to order your pup in any sweater, jacket or coat? Chest sizes are a challenge when fitting a dog. That's why the widely used front closure is problematic. If you measure the chest incorrectly, the jacket just won't fit. Trying to use the typical manufacturer's size chart is risky – too many measurements and too easy to make a mistake. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485215837/vgzb9rdybzvqtz6qvtnw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>With the 5-Second Dog Parka, you only have to give us one measurement - from your pup's neck to the base of their tail - and we guarantee our parka will fit, regardless of what shape, size, or breed they are. And with our functional design, every dog from a Yorkie to a Great Dane will be able to run, jump, explore, and move freely, no matter the weather.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-pin-nopin=""true"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485215876/qaiv6fnyelahchejlezb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>We've spared no expense creating this parka and our quality design, materials, and craftsmanship reflect that.</p><p>The shell is incredible. We used a premium Canadian-made fabric that has been tried and tested for decades in our frigid Canadian winters. Water and snow resistant, this fabric is the benchmark of quality in the outerwear world, normally only found on men's and ladies' outerwear that typically costs close to $1000. This incredibly durable fabric and the workmanship we put into it gives us the confidence to offer our industry-leading 5 Year Guarantee. It can take anything your dog may throw at it. </p><p>The top part of the shell is filled with perfectly balanced, 100% Canadian goose down. Our manufacturing partner has proprietary down filling technology that ensures perfectly weighed down in every jacket, every time. </p><p>It was important for us to keep the 5-Second Dog Parka light, so your active dog could keep moving. So, we decided to line the contoured chest panel with premium Thinsulate, which keeps your pup warm while also allowing for freer movement.

</div></blockquote></div>","Dogs are our best friends. They do everything with us. And when winter rolls around, there is no stopping them. Winter dog jackets need to be easy to get on, keep your dog warm and active, and last a lifetime. The jacket you wear in the winter is all of these things, why shouldn't your dog's be?Getting your dog into a winter jacket when he is excited to get outside can be a challenge. Most jackets require your dog to lift his legs and awkwardly fit them through holes that may not properly fit. Chest sizes vary dramatically from breed to breed and make picking the right size difficult. And then, when you finally find a jacket that sort of works, it only lasts a season or two and then you have to do it all over again.It doesn't have to be this way.That's why we designed the 5-Second Dog Parka. The world's easiest and fastest fitting winter dog jacket.Dog jackets on the market today are not designed with your pup in mind. They are modified human coats and require your dog to lift his legs into arm holes and button or zip up the chest - movements that can be an issue for senior dogs, easily distracted puppies, or any high energy dog raring to get outside and explore.Our design was the result of many prototypes and a year of testing. We wanted to design a jacket that had very few moving parts but still have the ability to be adaptable.With a self adjusting neck, one clip, and Velcro sides, the 5-Second Dog Parka is the easiest fitting jacket you'll ever put on your dog. Simply follow these steps:
Slide the parka over your pup's head
Adjust the midsection clip
Smooth out the Velcro sides - you're done!
 Sizing? No problem.How many times have you torn your hair out trying to figure out what size to order your pup in any sweater, jacket or coat? Chest sizes are a challenge when fitting a dog. That's why the widely used front closure is problematic. If you measure the chest incorrectly, the jacket just won't fit. Trying to use the typical manufacturer's size chart is risky – too many measurements and too easy to make a mistake. With the 5-Second Dog Parka, you only have to give us one measurement - from your pup's neck to the base of their tail - and we guarantee our parka will fit, regardless of what shape, size, or breed they are. And with our functional design, every dog from a Yorkie to a Great Dane will be able to run, jump, explore, and move freely, no matter the weather.We've spared no expense creating this parka and our quality design, materials, and craftsmanship reflect that.The shell is incredible. We used a premium Canadian-made fabric that has been tried and tested for decades in our frigid Canadian winters. Water and snow resistant, this fabric is the benchmark of quality in the outerwear world, normally only found on men's and ladies' outerwear that typically costs close to $1000. This incredibly durable fabric and the workmanship we put into it gives us the confidence to offer our industry-leading 5 Year Guarantee. It can take anything your dog may throw at it. The top part of the shell is filled with perfectly balanced, 100% Canadian goose down. Our manufacturing partner has proprietary down filling technology that ensures perfectly weighed down in every jacket, every time. It was important for us to keep the 5-Second Dog Parka light, so your active dog could keep moving. So, we decided to line the contoured chest panel with premium Thinsulate, which keeps your pup warm while also allowing for freer movement. The chest panel is made from the same snow and water resistant durable shell as the top, giving it the ability to stand up to the wear and tear of an active outdoor session. And finally, the lining is made out of soft and cozy microfleece, which wicks away moisture, keeping your pup dry and toasty, no matter how much running around they're doing.**UPDATE: We've gotten a few backers inquiring about harness holes for their pup's parka. We wanted to let you know that, yes, we will have a small opening on the back to accommodate dogs who prefer harnesses when out for their walk :) We're from Canada - and we know cold. So we knew our parka had to be made in the same country it was inspired from.We have an exclusive relationship with a Toronto-based state of the art factory, who have decades of experience putting out some of the best outerwear in the world. Our proprietary fabrics are hand selected, with extreme attention to detail, to ensure exceptional performance, no matter what conditions your dog may face.Our founder, Jeremy Potvin, and our lead designer, Nikki Kime, both have a combined 40+ years of experience in Canadian manufacturing.

<p><br/><strong>How we do it</strong></p>
<p>At OSTEN, we aim create bags for eternity: each OSTEN bag is 100% unique and durable. With our factory in Panyu, China we have access to best workmanship, quality and pricing. Crafted from weatherproof, recycled 1680D nylon, each bag is combined with rip-stop lining and double-reinforced seams on all corners and edges. This high quality workmanship combine with intricate design details crafted from Chinese posters ensure each bag is unique.

<p>We see potential challenges in the sales &amp; marketing approach. As every product will be absolutely unique the SKU management is somewhat difficult for normal retailers and distributors. We therefore plan to focus on direct sales through web stores - this will keep the street price clean, the products in demand and increase the margin.</p>

<p>
This July 8 thru 10 the progressive Berlin fashion trade show “SEEK” will open their doors once again to designers.   Displaying my collection at this fashion trade show  will allow me the opportunity to grow my business by meeting, discussing and selling my collections to retail professionals. This in turn will be the start of customers being able to buy my hats in retail boutiques and store.</p>
(Click on the video above to see what happens inside this trade event)<p></p>
<p><i>“SEEK is a progressive
contemporary fashion trade show in Berlin. Since setting up shop in 2009, we
have presented our ever-growing audience with new labels, and re-introduced old
brands to new customers. Our biannual shows are focused on modern clothes for
independent minds.”</i></p><p><em></em></p><p><em>                  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/318820/files/20140120044810-564042_3826100665435_934064852_n.jpg?1390222090"" src="""" style=""width: 356.12px; height: 237px;""/></em></p><p><br/></p><p>
</p><p>In order to participate in the SEEK tradeshow I will need to build and prepare a website for review that exudes the quality and high end styling that my hats are known for. Plus I will need to raise the money for a booth package where I can display and sell my hats directly to boutique and retail buyers. Spaces are extremely limited in this show and I have to get approved early.</p>
<p>Your patronage of 5 euros or more will help me in reaching my goal
for the 3 day fashion event in Berlin. The collected funds will help me to cover the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>A booth
     package for 2-5 sqm , </li>
<li>Table and 2 chairs for seating </li>

In 2012, I turned my life long dream into reality I launched  Das Haberdasher, a brand of stylish and handcrafted line of hats that can be worn by anyone. Our product line of hats are hand crafted with personal care, using good quality materials in a social and ethical work environment.).Last year I was hand selected from several hundred International Hat Designers, by the legendry Milliner Stephen Jones to participate in the ""Hat Designer of the year"" competition sponsored by The Hat Magazine. Out of over 300
internationally recognized Hat Designers, I can proudly say that my designs
placed within the top ten. Since then I have sold my hats in Austria, England, and
America (with the help of Patrons) to International Celebrities, performers
and European nobility here in Germany.After extensive research and test models, this year I am very excited to be releasing my 3rd hat collection. This special collection portrays my idea of European craftsmanship and mixing it with my American style. This will be a unisex collection that highlights the beauty of nature by incorporating new and unusual materials in dramatic ways that are not found in today’s hat designs.


With this new collection I am setting dreams even higher and pushing myself even further. With your help I would like to launch my upcoming hat collection Berlin's International Fashion
Week SS15

This July 8 thru 10 the progressive Berlin fashion trade show “SEEK” will open their doors once again to designers.   Displaying my collection at this fashion trade show  will allow me the opportunity to grow my business by meeting, discussing and selling my collections to retail professionals. This in turn will be the start of customers being able to buy my hats in retail boutiques and store.
(Click on the video above to see what happens inside this trade event)
“SEEK is a progressive
contemporary fashion trade show in Berlin. Since setting up shop in 2009, we
have presented our ever-growing audience with new labels, and re-introduced old
brands to new customers. Our biannual shows are focused on modern clothes for
independent minds.”                  
In order to participate in the SEEK tradeshow I will need to build and prepare a website for review that exudes the quality and high end styling that my hats are known for. Plus I will need to raise the money for a booth package where I can display and sell my hats directly to boutique and retail buyers. Spaces are extremely limited in this show and I have to get approved early.
Your patronage of 5 euros or more will help me in reaching my goal
for the 3 day fashion event in Berlin. The collected funds will help me to cover the following.

A booth
     package for 2-5 sqm , 
Table and 2 chairs for seating 
Display tables 
Hat display stands
Hat boxes
Funding
     for the new Das Haberdasher website.
Photography
     and editing
As a Patron of my campaign I want to give you something in return for your
contribution...to the right is a list of fun “perks” which you will receive in
return for your wonderful contribution.


Any and all of your contributions are most welcomed. And each one puts me
one step closer to reaching my goal. If however, I do not meet my goal, naturally
it will prolong my launch for at least another 6 months to a year. But the
monies that are contributed will still be used for launching Das Haberdasher as
a web based hat Design Company. And in hopes, the financial contributions will
allow me the chance to bring a new collection to Berlin Fashion week in January
2015.
I understand that some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean
you can’t help my campaign:

Please forward my campaign to friends, a family

<p>Hey Indiegogo, </p>
<p>Thanks for checking out our project. It’s been a lot of work and a lot of fun getting to this point, and we’re really excited to share Bureh with you. We’ve been making belts in Sierra Leone for over a year now and are proud to share our work. We're hoping to use Indiegogo to produce the next batch of Bureh Belts. </p>
<p>If our campaign is successful, we’ll be able to have the funds to employ Sierra Leonean blacksmiths and tailors fulltime working on our first shipment of belts. This will allow us to produce enough belts to set up an e-commerce site and approach retail outlets to carry our belts. 100% of money raised will go towards Bureh and Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>We’re looking forward to working with you, giving loads of rewards, and taking Bureh to the next step!</p>

<h2><strong>What is Bureh?</strong></h2>
<p>Bureh is an ethical fashion company. We make beautiful belts, each one handcrafted in Sierra Leone to the highest quality. We are about sharing Sierra Leonean fashion: its bright colors and playful patterns. We are also about re-investing HALF of profits back into Sierra Leone's enterprises. Our mission is to strengthen Sierra Leone's manufacturing sector hands-on, by working directly with, training and investing in it. </p>
<p>We train and employ Sierra Leonean craftsmen, skilled tailors and blacksmiths, to make Bureh belts using designs handpicked by us. Our cloth comes from the vibrant and living streets of Freetown, and our buckles are custom made for us using recycled metals.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>How are the Belts made?</strong></h2>
<p><em>Step 1: Source the fabric</em>.</p>
<p>We work with two types of fabric: batik and country cloth. We buy our batik from local trader women at local markets.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1354.photobucket.com/albums/q695/dhh2106/545944_260771720692377_2060105401_n_zpsc309a8d2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The country cloth we buy from weavers in the provinces. They literally unravel unwanted clothing from the second-hand markets and recycle the threads to produce country cloth. Talk about re-purposing unwanted items! Country cloth is traditionally worn by Chiefs and other respected members in Sierra Leone. Pretty cool stuff.</p>
<address><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1354.photobucket.com/albums/q695/dhh2106/206164_260765770692972_949177593_n_zps19587880.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""A weaver at work""/></address>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Step 2: Make the buckle</em></p>
<p>We work with a workshop of metal workers in the east of Freetown to hand make each of our buckles. Sheku’s workshop is impressive not just for the quality of its work but the value of its social mission. The workshop works exclusively with people with disabilities--a typically marginalized population in Sierra Leone--and trains them to be blacksmiths. Typically polio survivors and/or amputees, these blacksmiths are known to be some of the best in Freetown.</p>
<p>They use recycled metals—often used car parts—to create our hand crafted buckles. These come in two styles: D-ring buckles (1.5” wide; steel) and traditional buckles (1” wide; brass).</p>
<address><img alt=""Sheku, our head blacksmith, with Grant"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1354.photobucket.com/albums/q695/dhh2106/387116_260774104025472_1091913149_n_zps7580b386.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Sheku, our head blacksmith, with Grant""/></address>
<p><em>Step 3: Tailoring</em></p>
<p>With buckle and fabric, our tailors get to work. They prepare the fabric and the webbing rope that fills our belts. The webbing rope gives our belts flexibility and strength. Our tailors use foot-peddled sewing machines to help with the work and hand stitch parts of the belts. Each belt is made one at a time, from start to finish by one tailor, paying attention to every detail. The result is one, hand-crafted, vibrant Bureh Belt.</p>

<h2><strong>Why Sierra Leone? </strong></h2>
<p><em>Daniel:</em> I moved to Sierra Leone in 2009 to work for the Jameel Poverty Action Lab, an MIT based research group. The lab sent me to Sierra Leone. It was an accident and the luckiest thing that could have happened. I immediately fell in love with the country. </p>
<address><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1354.photobucket.com/albums/q695/dhh2106/IMG_0386_zpsd81ddd17.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Kailahun District""/></address>
<p><img alt=""Turtle Islands"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1354.photobucket.com/albums/q695/dhh2106/P1000945_zps54fc2261.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Turtle Islands""/></p>
<p>Sierra Leone doesn't have a good reputation, driven by civil war, Blood Diamond (the Leo movie), and poverty. What I found was very different. </p>
<p>Sierra Leone is a country of stunning natural beauty and a great fashion sense. Yes, Sierra Leone is also extremely poor, but that’s not the reputation it deserves. It should be known for its beauty, its fashion and its people. We want to try and make that happen. </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>What does Bureh mean? Where does the name come from? </strong></h2>
<p>Bai Bureh was a legendary Sierra Leonean chief from the 1890s. He lead a revolt against the British over a “Hut Tax” the British tried to institute. His legacy is undeniably complicated but he represents Sierra Leonean pride and national identity. Bureh Beach, our favorite beach, is named after Bai Bureh. The beach represents the raw beauty of Sierra Leone. </p>
<p>Together, Bureh represents the pride and beauty of Sierra Leone (plus, it doesn’t hurt to think of all the good times we’ve spent at Bureh Beach!) </p>
<p><em><img alt=""Bai Bureh"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1354.photobucket.com/albums/q695/dhh2106/199879_267815633321319_1216547212_n_zps48d5ebfb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></em></p>

Bevin Vignola and Christine Syquia have been lifelong friends. They met working at Nordstrom fresh out of art school almost twenty years ago.  While Bevin continued on in management with Nordstrom and eventually left the company with the birth of her first child, Christine moved on to a variety of companies eventually starting a handbag company in 2003.  Christine's company grew into a multi-million dollar,  international company however, the global economic downturn forced Christine's handbag company to close two years.  A year ago, Bevin and Christine started to join forces. While Bevin was home raising her family she was always creating-photographs, jewelry and fun accessories for her daughter's hair. When Christine saw her designs she knew Bevin had a future.  

The Bohemien Joyeux accessories are statement pieces.  


What We Need & What You Get

Our goal is $15,000.  Your pledge through INDIEGOGO will cover the cost of doing the show in New York (approximately $8,500 for the trade show alone) as well as all of the marketing materials associated with promoting a launch in fashion.  A portion of these funds will be used for our sampling costs for our small leather collection-buying raw materials and paying our local contractors to make a full collection of samples. 

The Impact

The reason we are trying to raise the funding is to have a strong presence at the trade show.  The funds will be used to generate marketing materials and to have a full collection of our samples to be on example at our booth. Currently, we are a small start-up and having a strong presence at this trade show will provide more exposure for our brand and allow our brand to continue to grow in the coming year.

<h3><img alt=""Recycled bags by Yadu"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7674591/indiegogo/home%20page%20image.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p>Hello and thank you for taking the time to visit our campaign here on IndieGoGo. We are very glad to have found about IndieGoGo and all the cool people here. Join Yadu as we unfold bags you've never seen before!</p>
<h2>What is Yadu?</h2>
<p>Yadu is a lifestyle brand that embodies the spirit of diversity and freedom. We make bags that are eco-friendly and unique, meaning nothing repeats itself! Having a Yadu bag means you are the only person that has that bag in the entire universe!</p>
<p>Yadu stems from a family of artists, musicians, and trendsetters in The Philippines. Its founder who is also my father, Yadu Saulo, started making bags as a hobby 36 years ago to fulfill his travel needs. This hobby then turned into a bag company he was not expecting. The company then was named Khumbmela. For more than 25 years, he continually established the Khumbmela brand that left an indelible mark in people's hearts. Khumbmela was well known for making outdoor bags and staging majestic events.</p>
<p>Four years ago, he came to discover an idea that touched the very core of his heart. The family collaborated on the idea and finally established Yadu around the principle of sustainability. From this idea, materialized a will to help Mother Earth and reestablish our love for her with the way our products are made and the message we deliver.</p>
<p>Yadu embraces the same philosophy that Khumbmela has lived on throughout the years. While Khumbmela personified the spirit of artistic gathering in its era, it’s offspring, Yadu, ushers a new lifestyle brand with the same distinct attitude founded upon the Khumbmela praxis. In Yadu, life is happening!</p>
<h2>Why Help Yadu?</h2>
<p>This campaign is born with the will to increase awareness of using eco-friendly and recycled products. By helping Yadu, you are connecting with your grassroots. This is a simple means to help Mother Nature and benefit your everyday needs at the same time. There are lots of activities around sustainability and helping Mother Nature, but we believe that giving help can never be measured and has no end. We, at Yadu, also want to be a part of that by doing what we do best. You can also help Yadu by sharing our message across your friends and families! Any type of help is highly appreciated. And from the depths of our hearts, we would like to give you our warmest thanks! :)</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>
<h3>Do you make leather bags or incorporate leather in your bags?</h3>
<p>We don't support usage of leather in anyway being a family of vegetarians. However, occasionally we come across old clothes made of leather which we integrate with the bags. </p>
<h3>Do you make fur bags or incorporate fur with your bags?</h3>
<p>We only use and incorporate synthetic fur with our bags. However, occasionally, we come across old clothes made of real fur which we integrate with the bags.</p>
<h3>Aren't your bags frail since they're all made with recycled clothes?</h3>
<p>Our bags are not completely 100% recycled. We fuse in stronghold materials such as nylon and canvass to achieve a 999% sturdiness then we bind them all together with our magical sewing techniques! We also use extra-durable YKK accessories, such as zippers, sliders, and locks to work with our bags.</p>
<h3>Are Yadu bags washable?</h3>
<p>Dry cleaning or hand washing is best to take good care of Yadu bags. It is not advisable to machine wash the bags.</p>
<h3>Will Yadu be available in my country?</h3>
<p>Yes, with your help of course! If you're interested in bringing Yadu bags to your country, you can email us at life@yadu621.com.</p>
<h3>Do you have an online store?</h3>
<p>We don't have an online store yet, but with your help in making this campaign successful, our path is directed towards making the world's best online shopping center for customized bags! :)</p>
<h3>What does 621 mean in Yadu 621?</h3>
<p>Our company name is Yadu 621, Inc. and 621 is my father's birth date, June 21. It is also the time of the year where we celebrate Yadu's biggest annual event.</p>
<h3>Do Yadu bags have any warranty?</h3>
<p>We actually offer a LIFETIME warranty with each bag local customers in the Philippines. As much as want to provide lifetime warranties on our bags overseas, it is currently not possible, but definitely this is in our list once we expand to other countries.</p>
<h3>How Else can I contribute?</h3>
<p>You can contribute by simply spreading the word about Yadu bags to your friends and family.</p>
<h3>Is any of the Bags on the Catalogs Available?</h3>
<p>If you spotted one in the catalog you fell in love with, chances are, it is no longer available. Our bags move fast! But we can definitely make something close to what you saw on our catalog. Our campaign on IndieGoGo caters specifically for custom orders, which we rarely offer to local customers in the Philippines.</p>

<p>My
fashion and art education was in Paris, where I have been living for many
years, and where my Vilorija company is based.</p>
<p>The collection is now selling in Boutique and Art
Gallery Friendly Society in Berlin. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/854822/files/20140913162540-18.png?1410650740"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>My first 2 Vilorija collections were very haute
couture, with many handmade and luxury details, very expensive to make - so
they had to be expensive. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/860407/files/20140915214405-02.jpg?1410842645"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>
<p>But now I want to enrich my brand with wearable,
pret-à-porter pieces, and to make it more accessible.</p>
<p>I’m preparing a very
beautiful and attractive new collection – which will be also very wearable and
practical.</p>
<p>The new collection will be consisted of 2 parts:</p>
<p>1. Pret-à-porter pieces - that anyone can wear to look
simple but very chic, casually-elegant and beautiful in any occasion</p>
<p>2. A few luxury unique pieces – very special and
artistic gowns and cocktail dresses - for red carpets, glamorous events, and
also for artistic projects, music videos etc.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With the
new collection I have very serious plans to make the great success and business- and to establish my brand Vilorija
as new important Parisian fashion brand.</p>
<p>I have some
strong ideas how to really make it. </p>
<p></p>
<p>But now I
need the support and help to finance the production of my new collection.</p>

<p></p>
<p>All I managed to do with my Vilorija brand by now is
made of huge hard work, of lots of passion, love, dreams, courage and enthusiasm,
working with friends and wonderful talented open-minded people all over the
world.</p>
<p>My work
with all artists, models, actors, photographers, painters, musicians, etc, who
participated in various creative projects and presentations of my collections, was
always based on mutual inspiration, exchange of ideas and creativity, and

<p></p>
<p>With my
Vilorija brand I’m trying to bring something beautiful, new and fresh to the
World Fashion - and I was investing all I had to make it.</p>
<p>I achieved
quite a lot with only very small budget that I had as
investment with which I had to make everything, to start and establish my
brand. </p>
<p>On the
market I have to compete with many rich fashion companies. Many of them invest
huge (often unreasonable) money in marketing and promotion - so it is very hard
to make it without money, trying to do it all just with talent, passion and huge
work.</p>
<p></p>

<p>I am
producing my dresses in the ateliers of tailors in Paris and in Belgrade<span>, wonderful women with more than 30 years of
professional experience, who love their work and do it always top quality, making
each dress and each piece with a lot of love. </span></p>
<p>Our goal is
to execute each detail on each piece with absolute perfection, inside and out.</p>

<p>WHAT
VILORIJA NEEDS MONEY FOR?</p>
<p>1. To pay the pattern maker – for
making professional industrial patterns of all the pieces of the new
collection</p>
<p>2. To pay tailors – for sewing and producing the prototypes of the new collection</p>
<p>3. To pay all materials for making of the new collection, all fabrics,
linens, embroidered bands, decorative details etc.</p>
<p>4. To produce materials with unique Vilorija prints designed by Jelena –
which will make the collection very chic, special and beautiful.</p>
<p> (for producing personal print designs on materials the minimum order is 20 meters per print
design)</p>
<p>5. To produce beautiful embroidered bands – with unique and special
embroideries designed by Jelena.</p>
<p>(for producing personal designed embroideries, the minimum order is 50 meters of bands per
embroidery design)</p>
<p>6. To pay all the shipping costs, customs, etc.</p>
<p>7. If we collect more – it would help to make even more creative
collection! – to also invest a little bit more in making some luxury, very
special pieces of the new Vilorija collection. Like very special and artistic and wonderful Vilorija gowns, for
styling film stars for red carpets on Cannes Film Festival (where Vilorija
already showcased twice, and where she is always very well received), and on
film events in Hollywood. And also to make
very artistic and creative costumes for musicians, for concerts and music
videos (Jelena is working with many fantastic musicians, who are her wonderful
inspiring friends in Berlin, Belgrade, Paris etc)</p>
<p>It would also help
to make more prototypes of the pret-à-porter collection in all sizes – to have
it immediately ready for all Vilorija’s clients.</p>
<p>8. To also produce
Vilorija men’s collection! </p>
<p>
</p><p>In Vilorija “I’ll
Be Your Mirror” collection there were a few men’s coats, which were made to
complete mostly women’s collection, as beautiful “mirrors” of the women. </p>
<p>As the collection
was inspired by Velvet Underground song “I’ll Be Your Mirror”, the most
beautiful Love song, which describes Love as being the mirror of the partner.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/866224/files/20140918094637-216007_10150159171536818_4832210_n.jpg?1411058797"" src="""" style=""width: 363.4552380952381px; height: 533px;""/></p><p>
</p><p>These few men’s
pieces were not very pret-à-porter – they were more artistic and conceptual, to complete the beautiful mirror story of the collection.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/866227/files/20140918094738-417286_10150605005901818_1179984622_n.jpg?1411058858"" src="""" style=""width: 362.60869565217394px; height: 440px;""/></p>
<p>
</p><p>But for the new
collection Jelena is planning to also design a great pret-à-porter men’s
collection – a complete, wearable, at the same time very elegant but also
casual, very strong and beautiful collection for men.</p>

<p><b>PLANS FOR PRESENTING THE NEW COLLECTION</b></p>
<p>When the new
collection is made – the plan is to present it with very attractive fashion
show - either on L.A. Fashion Week (where Vilorija
started to show her first 2 collections) - or on New York Fashion Week, or
on Paris Fashion Week, or on Berlin Fashion Week - depending on the
timing when the collection will be ready.</p>

<p><b>ABOUT VILORIJA DESIGNER, JELENA VUJANOVIC</b></p>
<p>Vilorija designer Jelena Vujanovic graduated fashion
design in Paris, in prestigious fashion academy Studio Berçot.</p>
<p>She also studied at Academy of Fine Arts in Belgrade,
and attended intensive fashion design courses at Saint Martin's College of Art
and Design in London.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/866836/files/20140918141950-20.jpg?1411075190"" src="""" style=""width: 366.66666666666663px; height: 550px;""/></p>
<p>Besides fashion, she also studied Fine Arts in Paris
at famous Sorbonne University, and also graduated Chinese language and literature
at Belgrade University.</p>
<p>Before starting brand Vilorija, Jelena worked in Paris
for some prestigious Parisian fashion designers, and gained lots of very
refined and precious experience.</p>
<p>Among the others, she
worked as assistant in creation studio of Parisian designer Jean Charles de
Castelbajac (<a href=""http://jc-de-castelbajac.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://jc-de-castelbajac.com</a>), who has always been one of Jelena’s favorite
designers, with his Pop Art style and multi-media artistic work. </p>
<p>She was very lucky to
work for one of her forever-favorite designers, famous Parisian luxury lingerie
designer Fifi Chachnil (<a href=""http://fifichachnil.com/fr"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://fifichachnil.com/fr</a>)  - as her main
assistant for the collection that she designed for Crazy Horse Paris (<a href=""http://www.lecrazyhorseparis.com/fr"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.lecrazyhorseparis.com/fr</a>)</p>

<p>Jelena is also
specialized for designing the luxury lingerie.</p>
<p>Her final book with
which she graduated Fashion Design at Studio Berçot in Paris was lingerie
collection, inspired by Betty Boop and Betty Page – a very feminine, sexy but
very refined, playful and cute luxury lingerie collection.</p>
<p>Jelena is planning to
realize these designs and to make Vilorija lingerie collection – just after
making the new collection that she is preparing now.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/866845/files/20140918142307-23.jpg?1411075387"" src="""" style=""width: 409.77681660899657px; height: 547px;""/></p>
<p>After the graduation
she was very lucky to meet her favorite lingerie designer Fifi, with whom
Jelena had so much in common, so they immediately developed very friendly and
very inspiring relation, and she became her main assistant for the collection
for Crazy Horse Paris.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Working for Fifi and
Crazy Horse was a huge pleasure and very precious experience for Jelena’s
development as designer.</p>
<p>They kept great
friendly relation, and Fifi was very supportive and encouraging when Jelena
started her Vilorija brand, which meant really a lot to Jelena.</p>

<p>Jelena is
born in Belgrade, the capital of Serbia and of ex-Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>Belgrade is the
city full of wonderful creative energy, where Jelena grew up in very happy, beautiful and
inspiring artistic and intellectual environment, hanging with many wonderful artists,
musicians, writers, etc. </p>
<p>Which formed Jelena’s character and style, and which Jelena always loves and
carries in her heart.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/866897/files/20140918143446-35-2.jpg?1411076086"" src="""" style=""width: 390.66666666666663px; height: 586px;""/></p>
<p>But
Belgrade has also been through very tough
times, due to very unfortunate, in-understandable and sad events in recent
history, which caused the falling apart of Yugoslavia, wonderful country in
which Jelena grew up.</p>
<p>Jelena
didn’t want to leave Belgrade during the most difficult times, she was there
even during 3 months of bombing, and she actually decided to move and continue
her life in Paris only when the situation in her hometown became more safe and
stable.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/866902/files/20140918143600-35-1.jpg?1411076160"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>After all
the bad things that happened with her country, just being born in Serbia and
having Serbian passport means to be actually condemned to the prison for the
whole life - as without European papers you are not allowed to freely live,
work and be anywhere in the world, out of the borders of the country in which
you just happened to be born. </p>
<p>So, while
trying to do her work and to bring something beautiful and happy to
the world – at the same time Jelena has to struggle very hard all her life to
just somehow have the basic human freedom to be in Europe and anywhere in the
world.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/866905/files/20140918143654-36.jpg?1411076214"" src="""" style=""width: 370.50898203592817px; height: 495px;""/></p>
<p>And that freedom is the most important to Jelena, as
an artist and passionate traveler, Citizen of The World, who lives and works
very internationally, connecting different cultures, working with many
wonderful creative people all over the world, and bringing her ideas and
designs from Paris to many cities world-wide, in which she is successfully
establishing her brand.</p>

<p><i>... ""What costume

<p>Financially
it was always very difficult in the country where Jelena comes from.</p>
<p>She
learned to live even almost totally without money, and to still be very
positive and full of creativity and life.</p>
<p>As
during the most difficult times no one in her country had money, but people
were still strong and positive, and managed to be very stylish and to have
quality life and lots of fun and happiness even with almost no money at all.</p>

<br/>
</div></div>","Hello, I am Jelena, fashion designer, I started my
Vilorija brand in 2012 in Paris, and presented my collections
on Los Angeles Fashion
Week and Berlin Fashion Week, and at the Cannes Film Festivals.

My
fashion and art education was in Paris, where I have been living for many
years, and where my Vilorija company is based.
The collection is now selling in Boutique and Art
Gallery Friendly Society in Berlin. 


My first 2 Vilorija collections were very haute
couture, with many handmade and luxury details, very expensive to make - so
they had to be expensive. 
But now I want to enrich my brand with wearable,
pret-à-porter pieces, and to make it more accessible.
I’m preparing a very
beautiful and attractive new collection – which will be also very wearable and
practical.
The new collection will be consisted of 2 parts:
1. Pret-à-porter pieces - that anyone can wear to look
simple but very chic, casually-elegant and beautiful in any occasion
2. A few luxury unique pieces – very special and
artistic gowns and cocktail dresses - for red carpets, glamorous events, and
also for artistic projects, music videos etc.

With the
new collection I have very serious plans to make the great success and business- and to establish my brand Vilorija
as new important Parisian fashion brand.
I have some
strong ideas how to really make it. 

But now I
need the support and help to finance the production of my new collection.


All I managed to do with my Vilorija brand by now is
made of huge hard work, of lots of passion, love, dreams, courage and enthusiasm,
working with friends and wonderful talented open-minded people all over the
world.
My work
with all artists, models, actors, photographers, painters, musicians, etc, who
participated in various creative projects and presentations of my collections, was
always based on mutual inspiration, exchange of ideas and creativity, and
strong belief to make something great together.




With my
Vilorija brand I’m trying to bring something beautiful, new and fresh to the
World Fashion - and I was investing all I had to make it.
I achieved
quite a lot with only very small budget that I had as
investment with which I had to make everything, to start and establish my
brand. 
On the
market I have to compete with many rich fashion companies. Many of them invest
huge (often unreasonable) money in marketing and promotion - so it is very hard
to make it without money, trying to do it all just with talent, passion and huge
work.



I am
producing my dresses in the ateliers of tailors in Paris and in Belgrade, wonderful women with more than 30 years of
professional experience, who love their work and do it always top quality, making
each dress and each piece with a lot of love. 
Our goal is
to execute each detail on each piece with absolute perfection, inside and out.


If
you want to help me to continue to exist as a fashion designer, to establish my
brand and to make success with my new Vilorija collection - I will appreciate a
lot all your support.

New,
fresh and great fashion brand from Paris can be established - thank you for
helping and for being part of it!

Love
Jelena



WHAT
VILORIJA NEEDS MONEY FOR?
1. To pay the pattern maker – for
making professional industrial patterns of all the pieces of the new
collection
2. To pay tailors – for sewing and producing the prototypes of the new collection
3. To pay all materials for making of the new collection, all fabrics,
linens, embroidered bands, decorative details etc.
4. To produce materials with unique Vilorija prints designed by Jelena –
which will make the collection very chic, special and beautiful.
 (for producing personal print designs on materials the minimum order is 20 meters per print
design)
5. To produce beautiful embroidered bands – with unique and special
embroideries designed by Jelena.
(for producing personal designed embroideries, the minimum order is 50 meters of bands per
embroidery design)
6. To pay all the shipping costs, customs, etc.
7. If we collect more – it would help to make even more creative
collection! – to also invest a little bit more in making some luxury, very
special pieces of the new Vilorija collection. Like very special and artistic and wonderful Vilorija gowns, for
styling film stars for red carpets on Cannes Film Festival (where Vilorija
already showcased twice, and where she is always very well received), and on
film events in Hollywood. And also to make
very artistic and creative costumes for musicians, for concerts and music
videos (Jelena is working with many fantastic musicians, who are her wonderful
inspiring friends in Berlin, Belgrade, Paris etc)
It would also help
to make more prototypes of the pret-à-porter collection in all sizes – to have
it immediately ready for all Vilorija’s clients.
8. To also produce
Vilorija men’s collection! 

In Vilorija “I’ll
Be Your Mirror” collection there were a few men’s coats, which were made to
complete mostly women’s collection, as beautiful “mirrors” of the women. 
As the collection
was inspired by Velvet Underground song “I’ll Be Your Mirror”, the most
beautiful Love song, which describes Love as being the mirror of the partner.


These few men’s
pieces were not very pret-à-porter – they were more artistic and conceptual, to complete the beautiful mirror story of the collection.


But for the new
collection Jelena is planning to also design a great pret-à-porter men’s
collection – a complete, wearable, at the same time very elegant but also
casual, very strong and beautiful collection for men.


PLANS FOR PRESENTING THE NEW COLLECTION
When the new
collection is made – the plan is to present it with very attractive fashion
show - either on L.A. Fashion Week (where Vilorija
started to show her first 2 collections) - or on New York Fashion Week, or
on Paris Fashion Week, or on Berlin Fashion Week - depending on the
timing when the collection will be ready.


ABOUT THE BRAND VILORIJA
Vilorija is a fresh and new, upcoming luxury brand started in Paris, by designer Jelena Vujanovic.
Vilorija presented her
collections on Los Angeles Fashion Week and on Berlin Fashion
Week, and is now based in Paris, L.A. and Berlin.



Vilorija “Blume” collection was presented with runway
show on L.A. Fashion Week 2013.
It was very well received by media and members of the
press. 
Described as chic, Parisian, feminine, classy,
aristocratic and elegant. 
""The Vilorija line crosses femininity with a chic
Parisian edge"" - Lucky Contributor Magazine.





In 2012, Vilorija debuted her collection ""I’ll Be
Your Mirror” on L.A. Fashion Week at the famed Gower Studios in Hollywood.





Vilorija’s collections were presented at the Cannes
Film Festival in 2012 and 2013. 
During the Cannes Film Festival 2012 collection was
presented in Hotel Carlton, exclusively to A-list celebrities.





Among many actresses and celebrities who liked a lot
Vilorija line, also Paris Hilton, a fan of the line, left Cannes with the
entire Vilorija collection.

Lambert Wilson – Hollywood and French actress Delphine Chaneac



At the 2013 Cannes Film Festival Vilorija had runway
presentation at the famous luxury Villa Oxygène, an event was organized by the
Jackson Family Foundation.







It was a project with a French artist (painter) Frank
Katz, who made his special paintings on the dresses and men coats of Vilorija
collection – transforming each piece in the piece of art, with his unique
paintings on it.

For Jelena fashion is art – and she is always inspired to work and exchange ideas with many wonderful artists – to make fashion more multi-media and to connect it with different art forms.

ABOUT VILORIJA DESIGNER, JELENA VUJANOVIC
Vilorija designer Jelena Vujanovic graduated fashion
design in Paris, in prestigious fashion academy Studio Berçot.
She also studied at Academy of Fine Arts in Belgrade,
and attended intensive fashion design courses at Saint Martin's College of Art
and Design in London.


Besides fashion, she also studied Fine Arts in Paris
at famous Sorbonne University, and also graduated Chinese language and literature
at Belgrade University.
Before starting brand Vilorija, Jelena worked in Paris
for some prestigious Parisian fashion designers, and gained lots of very
refined and precious experience.
Among the others, she
worked as assistant in creation studio of Parisian designer Jean Charles de
Castelbajac (http://jc-de-castelbajac.com), who has always been one of Jelena’s favorite
designers, with his Pop Art style and multi-media artistic work. 
She was very lucky to
work for one of her forever-favorite designers, famous Parisian luxury lingerie
designer Fifi Chachnil (http://fifichachnil.com/fr)  - as her main
assistant for the collection that she designed for Crazy Horse Paris (http://www.lecrazyhorseparis.com/fr)

Jelena is also
specialized for designing the luxury lingerie.
Her final book with
which she graduated Fashion Design at Studio Berçot in Paris was lingerie
collection, inspired by Betty Boop and Betty Page – a very feminine, sexy but
very refined, playful and cute luxury lingerie collection.
Jelena is planning to
realize these designs and to make Vilorija lingerie collection – just after
making the new collection that she is preparing now.

After the graduation
she was very lucky to meet her favorite lingerie designer Fifi, with whom
Jelena had so much in common, so they immediately developed very friendly and
very inspiring relation, and she became her main assistant for the collection
for Crazy Horse Paris.


Working for Fifi and
Crazy Horse was a huge pleasure and very precious experience for Jelena’s
development as designer.
They kept great
friendly relation, and Fifi was very supportive and encouraging when Jelena
started her Vilorija brand, which meant really a lot to Jelena.

Described in one of the articles in press as “Citizen
of The World”, Jelena is a big traveler, inspired by beauty and charm
of various cities.

""I'll Be Your Mirror"" - Velvet Underground 
Jelena usually finds initial inspiration in music, and likes to dedicate her collections to songs that inspired her – 2013 collection was “I’ll Be Your Mirror”, named by Lou Reed’s Velvet Underground song, and 2014 collection was “Blume” (Flower) - named by a beautiful song by Berlin band Einsturzende Neubauten.

""Blume"" - Einsturzende Neubauten



Jelena is
born in Belgrade, the capital of Serbia and of ex-Yugoslavia.
Belgrade is the
city full of wonderful creative energy, where Jelena grew up in very happy, beautiful and
inspiring artistic and intellectual environment, hanging with many wonderful artists,
musicians, writers, etc. 
Which formed Jelena’s character and style, and which Jelena always loves and
carries in her heart.

But
Belgrade has also been through very tough
times, due to very unfortunate, in-understandable and sad events in recent
history, which caused the falling apart of Yugoslavia, wonderful country in
which Jelena grew up.
Jelena
didn’t want to leave Belgrade during the most difficult times, she was there
even during 3 months of bombing, and she actually decided to move and continue
her life in Paris only when the situation in her hometown became more safe and
stable.

After all
the bad things that happened with her country, just being born in Serbia and
having Serbian passport means to be actually condemned to the prison for the
whole life - as without European papers you are not allowed to freely live,
work and be anywhere in the world, out of the borders of the country in which
you just happened to be born. 
So, while
trying to do her work and to bring something beautiful and happy to
the world – at the same time Jelena has to struggle very hard all her life to
just somehow have the basic human freedom to be in Europe and anywhere in the
world.

And that freedom is the most important to Jelena, as
an artist and passionate traveler, Citizen of The World, who lives and works
very internationally, connecting different cultures, working with many
wonderful creative people all over the world, and bringing her ideas and
designs from Paris to many cities world-wide, in which she is successfully
establishing her brand.

... ""What costume
shall the poor girl wear, to All Tomorrow’s Parties…""
– Velvet Underground
song ""All Tomorrow’s Parties"" was inspiration for Jelena’s first collection –
which she created when she studied fashion in Paris – and during the studies
she went to Belgrade Fashion Week to show her first collection in her birth-town.

Financially
it was always very difficult in the country where Jelena comes from.
She
learned to live even almost totally without money, and to still be very
positive and full of creativity and life.
As
during the most difficult times no one in her country had money, but people
were still strong and positive, and managed to be very stylish and to have
quality life and lots of fun and happiness even with almost no money at all.
And
now, when she is producing the collections for her Parisian fashion brand
Vilorija – Jelena is very happy and proud to produce in Belgrade, her
birth-city. 

Jelena is
completely dedicated to designing, doing lots of artistic researches and very
elaborate creating – and she is proud that her collections are being produced
by experienced, highest quality professionals.
She is
producing in the atelier of the tailors who are one of the highest quality in
Europe, making each detail with absolute perfection.
When she is
producing the prototypes of her collections she is working in atelier with her
tailors, participating and carefully directing the making of each piece.
She is
buying the materials for her collections in Paris, in beautiful fabric shops in
Montmartre area and in Sentier, and also many beautiful decorative details in
wonderful old traditional Parisian shops in Marais.

First she is
developing her collections in Paris, working with talented Parisian
students from the best schools of couture production, to make some of the first
shapes of prototypes and patterns.
And also
with great local Parisian tailors in old tailoring ateliers in Montmartre –
where she develops the first initial pieces of her collections.

And than
she brings it to the atelier in Belgrade, where she makes industrial patterns
and the whole professional production of official, highest quality prototypes
of her collections. 
So the
production is in Paris and in Belgrade.
And for
bigger orders she is working with a factory in Serbia, in Arilje area, famous
for the highest quality clothing factories in whole Europe.
Thanks to
great clothing production industry, this entire area managed to develop very
well their local economy, which is rare and difficult in Serbia.


All people
that Jelena works with - from tailors and pattern makers, to all artists,
photographers, models, etc - it is always with warm hearted, friendly and
loving relationships, always with some fun and lightness, and always in very
caring way, full of mutual understanding.






Jelena
invested all she could in materials and making of her first 2 collections – and
now she needs help to finance the production of her new collection - to make
something beautiful, fresh and big with her brand Vilorija.

Jelena is
thinking big, dreaming big, and is ready to passionately follow her dreams, to
work a lot, and to do everything and to go anywhere for her dreams and for the success
of her work.

Jelena is
full of inspiration and creative energy, has great ideas and many beautiful
designs - and is ready to produce the fantastic new Vilorija collection!

If you like
and support Jelena’s work as artist - and if you want to be the part of making
success of her Vilorija brand – support this project as much as you can!

Jelena now

As Kersten
Haines (the organizer of Berlin Fashion

Jelena’s wonderful, very inspiring friends) says: - it’s all about the

<p>The Earring Renaissance pendant is an elegant solution to the lonely earring problem! This easy-change pendant system was made for someone who has lost a post-style earring and has one earring remaining. I created it because I wanted a solution to the lonely earring problem myself — it’s a problem I know all too well!  </p>

<h3>
<span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">Many remaining earrings are heirlooms, sentimental and valuable, and they often sit forgotten in a jewelry box tucked away somewhere. With the Earring Renaissance pendant, you can showcase your forgotten heirloom treasures, </span><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">as well as showcase your lonely earrings.</span>
</h3>
<h3>
<span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">We've found that items such a father’s tie tack or a grandmother’s sorority pin often work perfectly on the pendant. Now they can be displayed beautifully with no modifications to the earring or pin needed!</span><br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>So, you can get creative in your jewelry box to see what items will work on the pendant, and then showcase your treasured jewelry as a beautiful necklace! </p>

<p><b>Laura's Giclée Reproductions:  </b><br/></p>
<p>The word Giclée describes the remarkable, high-quality reproduction process that makes these reproductions look identical to the original oil painting -- they are of the highest caliber. I guess this reflects how picky I am when it comes to art and things my name is attached to! I worked with the people in the lab to create these reproductions, advising on color and comparing them to the original until I was completely satisfied. There are less expensive services, but these reproductions are far superior. I know, I've tried others.</p>
<p>These limited-edition reproductions will be on canvas, hand stretched on wooden frames by the artist, and carefully packed along with your certificate of authenticity. Shipping will be premium with insurance, likely a two to three-day FedEx service or similar. We will ship in early December (in time for the holidays). The reproductions are standard sizes, which means it's easy and affordable to get a standard-sized open frame with no custom framing needed. They are the perfect size for any home--not too big, not too small.</p>

<p>The Earring Renaissance team has minimized the risks to you. We have spent more than two years doing intensive prep work for this product launch and Indiegogo campaign.  We have already ordered and reviewed samples of the Earring Renaissance pendant to ensure the quality of the U.S. artisan team that will be creating the pendants. We've just placed a medium-sized order, and they are standing by to create as many pieces as needed for this campaign. Note: There is a limited number of pendants offered during this campaign (Aug. 5 - Sept. 5, 2015)  so that we would be able to take care of our early supporters. We have done our homework and are ready to fulfill our commitment!   </p>
<p>Mailing and shipping:  We will be using the U.S. Postal Service for mailing our carefully wrapped pendants, and our boxes will be sent with tracking just in case we need to see what the status is. We will alert you when the packages are shipped and keep you updated along the way.  The painting reproductions will be shipped using a premium service, such as Fed-Ex 2 or 3 day shipping, the packages will be trackable and they will be insured.</p>
<p>If our funding goal is met then your purchases will be activated and you cards will be charged for your purchase, and the wheels will turn for us to gladly fulfill the requested perks.  If the funding is not met in total, then you will be notified and your cards will not be charged.  We will keep you posted on future plans in either case.<br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437968061/ktzrxx4d62f4nmwezg8w.jpg"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""/><br/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">This is Phase I of two phases of the Earring Renaissance product launch. We are </span>currently designing<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> a second pendant that will </span>easily<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> showcase your dangle-style earrings. All types of earrings will be able to have a collective ""Renaissance.""</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We plan to earn your trust and deliver on Phase One before heading into the second pendant solution for dangle earrings. If we go well beyond our initial fundraising goal, we may be able to fund moving forward with the second piece.  We will keep you posted!</span></p>
<p>Our expenses include a w<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">ebsite, promotional infrastructure, advertising, promotional videos, a product animation video, staff, inventory of pendants, gift boxes, peripheral necklace chains and supplies, shipping boxes, and packing materials and packing </span>fulfillment<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">. They all come into play, totaling $10,150 to $10,800. </span></p>
<p>The Earring Renaissance pendant system is also in the process of being patented, and the typical patent attorney fees and filing fees are easily more than $10,000. Our costs are lower because Laura did the patent drawings and the provisional patent herself.  So the question may be, why are you only needing $6,000?  Well, this project is also about building community and getting valuable feedback from you. We believe we are working with an attainable amount and want to build our product line one step at a time, as we build your trust.  If this vision resonates with you and you embrace what the Earring Renaissance pendant can do for our collective lonely earrings, we are on our way.  We are grateful for your important role in this journey!  <br/></p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">A:  Yes, we anticipate the pedants shipping in late November. The pendants that had the gift wrap perk will be mailed by the 11th of December, so they will reach their destination in plenty of time for the holidays but not too early (November).  If you would like your gift pendant shipped later in November when the other pendants are shipped, please let us know and we'll take care of it.  </span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Q: When will the painting reproductions ship?  </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">A: The painting reproduction will also ship by Dec. 11, so they will also be there in time for gift giving, and will be insured and shipped via Fed-Ex two or three-day or similar.  Each reproduction will be insured for $300, and also comes with a Certificate of Authenticity, signed by the artist and a 20% discount coupon.</span></p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Q: Will the 10 percent off coupon for the pendants be digital or a physical coupon?</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">A:  Good question! The 10 percent </span>coupons<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> for the pendants will be physical coupons mailed with your pendant. The coupons are good for 10 percent off a single item through the <a href=""http://www"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a></span> <a href=""http://www.earringrenaissance.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.earringrenaissance.com</a> <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> website (good for one year).  Since we are already </span>shipping<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> the pendants, enclosing a coupon makes </span>sense.</p>
<p>Q: Didn't I read about digital coupons?  </p>
<p>A: Yes, the first two perks at the $10 and $20 level do not include a pendant, and the donors receive a digital coupon (sent to the e-mail address provided). Donors who contribute $10 get a digital coupon for 10 percent off, and those who contribute $20 get a digital coupon for 20 percent off. The coupons are good for the purchase of a single item (pendant) through the <a href=""http://www.earringrenaissance.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.earringrenaissance.com</a> website (good for one year). </p>

The Earring Renaissance pendant is an elegant solution to the lonely earring problem! This easy-change pendant system was made for someone who has lost a post-style earring and has one earring remaining. I created it because I wanted a solution to the lonely earring problem myself — it’s a problem I know all too well!  
Here's how it works:

Many remaining earrings are heirlooms, sentimental and valuable, and they often sit forgotten in a jewelry box tucked away somewhere. With the Earring Renaissance pendant, you can showcase your forgotten heirloom treasures, as well as showcase your lonely earrings.


We've found that items such a father’s tie tack or a grandmother’s sorority pin often work perfectly on the pendant. Now they can be displayed beautifully with no modifications to the earring or pin needed!


So, you can get creative in your jewelry box to see what items will work on the pendant, and then showcase your treasured jewelry as a beautiful necklace! 
Here's what customers are saying:




Hold up your studs and post-style earrings to see the best finish for your lonely earrings -- these are actual size!





Each pendant has two sides (see above) and gives you two different design looks! The Earring Renaissance pendant is available in two silver finishes, Antique Silver and Classic
Silver, and two gold finishes, Antique Gold and Classic Gold.  The silver pendants have a quality
sterling silver plating, and the gold pendants have a quality 14K-gold plating.  
We're inviting you to help create a special run of limited-edition pendants, handmade by U.S. artisans that will help you reconnect to your heirloom treasures and lonely earrings.  
We're offering presales of the Earring Renaissance pendant along with an option to have the pendant gift wrapped and mailed to the person of your choice in time for the holidays.  This is truly a one-of-a-kind gift for someone special!
You will be helping to create this limited edition of Earring Renaissance pendants with your purchase.  Thank you for joining us on this journey to help showcase our collective lonely earrings!
COLOR, COLOR, COLOR! Rev up your wardrobe with color options!

Laura's Giclée Reproductions:  
The word Giclée describes the remarkable, high-quality reproduction process that makes these reproductions look identical to the original oil painting -- they are of the highest caliber. I guess this reflects how picky I am when it comes to art and things my name is attached to! I worked with the people in the lab to create these reproductions, advising on color and comparing them to the original until I was completely satisfied. There are less expensive services, but these reproductions are far superior. I know, I've tried others.
These limited-edition reproductions will be on canvas, hand stretched on wooden frames by the artist, and carefully packed along with your certificate of authenticity. Shipping will be premium with insurance, likely a two to three-day FedEx service or similar. We will ship in early December (in time for the holidays). The reproductions are standard sizes, which means it's easy and affordable to get a standard-sized open frame with no custom framing needed. They are the perfect size for any home--not too big, not too small.


Donors at this level also receive a
coupon for 20 percent off a future purchase of a single item (good for one year)
of shopping through the EarringRenaissance.com website, the weekly Earring Ren Newsletter and a prominent level of recognition on the ""Thank You"" wall on the website. Thank you so much for supporting us at this
significant level!

The Movie Mogul Perk!  

This perk is to name your own movie and tell your story or your family's story! This will be as unique as you are and is easier and more fun than writing a book. It could be a great gift for a milestone birthday or to leave family history details for generations to come. A team member will come to you in the U.S. and interview you and up to two others. This will be a two-camera shoot, and the result will be a personal, 20-minute HD video with beginning-and-end credits and music (the interviews and photos professionally edited). Your photos are welcome, and we can include up to 20 photos in this personalized perk. Our team member will fly to your locale and treat you like the movie mogul you are! Because this is our biggest perk, we will also let you choose your four favorite pendants to keep as a special gift from us. Just to clarify, this is ""your"" video. It will not be used by us for promotional purposes. You will also get our ""Earring Ren"" weekly newsletter and your name at the highest level on our ""Wall Of Thanks"" on the Earring Renaissance website. Our ""mega-mogul thank you"" and eternal gratitude for selecting this high-level perk!









We would love to hear your stories! -- Please share them on our Facebook page, (www.Facebook.com/EarringRenaissance) and send us your photos once you start creating your own looks with the Earring Renaissance pendants!  






The Earring Renaissance team has minimized the risks to you. We have spent more than two years doing intensive prep work for this product launch and Indiegogo campaign.  We have already ordered and reviewed samples of the Earring Renaissance pendant to ensure the quality of the U.S. artisan team that will be creating the pendants. We've just placed a medium-sized order, and they are standing by to create as many pieces as needed for this campaign. Note: There is a limited number of pendants offered during this campaign (Aug. 5 - Sept. 5, 2015)  so that we would be able to take care of our early supporters. We have done our homework and are ready to fulfill our commitment!   
Mailing and shipping:  We will be using the U.S. Postal Service for mailing our carefully wrapped pendants, and our boxes will be sent with tracking just in case we need to see what the status is. We will alert you when the packages are shipped and keep you updated along the way.  The painting reproductions will be shipped using a premium service, such as Fed-Ex 2 or 3 day shipping, the packages will be trackable and they will be insured.
If our funding goal is met then your purchases will be activated and you cards will be charged for your purchase, and the wheels will turn for us to gladly fulfill the requested perks.  If the funding is not met in total, then you will be notified and your cards will not be charged.  We will keep you posted on future plans in either case.

This is Phase I of two phases of the Earring Renaissance product launch. We are currently designing a second pendant that will easily showcase your dangle-style earrings. All types of earrings will be able to have a collective ""Renaissance.""
We plan to earn your trust and deliver on Phase One before heading into the second pendant solution for dangle earrings. If we go well beyond our initial fundraising goal, we may be able to fund moving forward with the second piece.  We will keep you posted!
Our expenses include a website, promotional infrastructure, advertising, promotional videos, a product animation video, staff, inventory of pendants, gift boxes, peripheral necklace chains and supplies, shipping boxes, and packing materials and packing fulfillment. They all come into play, totaling $10,150 to $10,800. 
The Earring Renaissance pendant system is also in the process of being patented, and the typical patent attorney fees and filing fees are easily more than $10,000. Our costs are lower because Laura did the patent drawings and the provisional patent herself.  So the question may be, why are you only needing $6,000?  Well, this project is also about building community and getting valuable feedback from you. We believe we are working with an attainable amount and want to build our product line one step at a time, as we build your trust.  If this vision resonates with you and you embrace what the Earring Renaissance pendant can do for our collective lonely earrings, we are on our way.  We are grateful for your important role in this journey!  


Whether you want to give $10 to show your support or to purchase a pendant, you will be helping to bring this project to life.  If you are not able to contribute here are some way you can help us with the campaign:
* You can help get the word out!  We'd  be grateful if you shared the video on Twitter (www.Twitter.com/EarringRen),   #EarringRen    #EarringRenGiveaway
Facebook  (www.Facebook.com/EarringRenaissance) 
or Pinterest (www.Pinterest.com/EarringRen).  
* You can also share your story about a treasured heirloom or share a ""lonely earring story"" on Facebook.  We really appreciate your help in letting others know about the pendant -- Go team!
*  And, sharing is easy with Indiegogo share tools!


""As a gift, it would provide my mother the opportunity to reconnect with special events and treasured memories of the people she loves."" -- Charles H.
""I just asked my wife about this the other day -- What do you do with all of those remaining earrings when you lose one? She said she keeps them in a little box, but it was clear they didn't get used. She would be delighted to be able to wear them again -- I think this pendant is a great idea! "" -- Morris G.
Q:  Will all pendants be shipped in time for the holidays?  
A:  Yes, we anticipate the pedants shipping in late November. The pendants that had the gift wrap perk will be mailed by the 11th of December, so they will reach their destination in plenty of time for the holidays but not too early (November).  If you would like your gift pendant shipped later in November when the other pendants are shipped, please let us know and we'll take care of it.  
Q: When will the painting reproductions ship?  
A: The painting reproduction will also ship by Dec. 11, so they will also be there in time for gift giving, and will be insured and shipped via Fed-Ex two or three-day or similar.  Each reproduction will be insured for $300, and also comes with a Certificate of Authenticity, signed by the artist and a 20% discount coupon.
Q: Will there be instructions in the pendant box?
A: Yes, there will be instructions showing you how to use your pendant.  We will also refer you to our product video that shows how the pendant is used. Instructions will be included in all pendant orders, including the gift-wrapped orders.
Q: Will the 10 percent off coupon for the pendants be digital or a physical coupon?
A:  Good question! The 10 percent coupons for the pendants will be physical coupons mailed with your pendant. The coupons are good for 10 percent off a single item through the  www.earringrenaissance.com  website (good for one year).  Since we are already shipping the pendants, enclosing a coupon makes sense.
Q: Didn't I read about digital coupons?  
A: Yes, the first two perks at the $10 and $20 level do not include a pendant, and the donors receive a digital coupon (sent to the e-mail address provided). Donors who contribute $10 get a digital coupon for 10 percent off, and those who contribute $20 get a digital coupon for 20 percent off. The coupons are good for the purchase of a single item (pendant) through the www.earringrenaissance.com website (good for one year).

</div><div>
<p><span></span></p>
<p>MERÏKH was officially launched 2014 by Hannele Merik. Hannele is born and raised in Stockholm Sweden. She has been traveling and living around the world, where she has collected inspiration &amp; experience. She has always had a passion for business, creativity &amp; traveling, and have worked many years as a Buyer and Production Manager in Sweden, Spain and China. Her main study is within: Purchasing at Stockholm’s International Business school, complemented with some design courses at FIT and ACA.</p>
<p>The idea of the concept got started from a NEED, and appeared while having a walk with her dog. Hannele had always plenty things in her hand which occasionally fell on the ground, and that is when she thought of an elegant little handbag which could be attached on: pet leash, bicycle, motorcycle, belt etc. To be able to have a walk or a ride without having anything in your hands and always have your essential items with you.</p>
<p>Today the original Multifunctional bag is the key item of the brand niche &amp; concept, which also can be attached on the front or interior of all other MERÏKH bags. It is a fun option that offers several looks and multi-functionality to your bag.

 OUR STORY:


MERÏKH was officially launched 2014 by Hannele Merik. Hannele is born and raised in Stockholm Sweden. She has been traveling and living around the world, where she has collected inspiration & experience. She has always had a passion for business, creativity & traveling, and have worked many years as a Buyer and Production Manager in Sweden, Spain and China. Her main study is within: Purchasing at Stockholm’s International Business school, complemented with some design courses at FIT and ACA.
The idea of the concept got started from a NEED, and appeared while having a walk with her dog. Hannele had always plenty things in her hand which occasionally fell on the ground, and that is when she thought of an elegant little handbag which could be attached on: pet leash, bicycle, motorcycle, belt etc. To be able to have a walk or a ride without having anything in your hands and always have your essential items with you.
Today the original Multifunctional bag is the key item of the brand niche & concept, which also can be attached on the front or interior of all other MERÏKH bags. It is a fun option that offers several looks and multi-functionality to your bag. MERÏKH´s vision is that these bags will be loved and enjoyed whether your going to a nightclub, traveling, on your way to work, walking your pet, shopping etc. The team intend to continuously improve and create new styles to the collection. Hope you enjoy them!

<p>                                                                             PICTURED ABOVE: All four <strong>SERIES 1</strong> Shirts </p>
<p>Hello everyone! My Name is <strong>Jason Littlefield</strong>, I am the art director and owner of <strong>ANTI Clothing</strong>. I'm here to find support for the release of my <strong>LIMITED EDITION SERIES 1</strong> T-shirt line. I have been at this for a very long time now and have put a lot of my past experiences in retail, fashion, and art school into this.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8370/8570133111_b87a0f48bb_z.jpg"" src="""" style=""font-size: 1.17em;""/></p>
<p>Coming from a small town in Lisbon Falls, ME I know how hard one must work to make their dreams come true. I am now currently located in Orlando, FL attending a design school called Full Sail University for Digital Art &amp; Design. I have spent all my free time away from class working on this company as it has been a dream of mine for some time now. Art and design has always been apart of my life every since I found doodling in elementary school more fun then the actual assignments. As an artist I have established myself in the small state of Maine and even have had my work showcased in the Portland Museum of Art. As for what I would like to achieve I haven't even scratched the surface and thats why I need your help.</p>
<p>Now a days its next to impossible to start your own t shirt company. Even with the best designs, the perfect demographic, and great marketing its hard to stick out in a market that is already so over-saturated. The same can be said about the art world, artist of all sorts pop up everyday struggling to find a solid following. So <strong>ANTI Clothing</strong> is here to try and change both of those issues by combining both worlds. They will do this by producing <strong>LIMITED EDTION</strong> clothing in small series and each series will feature a new artist. The goal with that is to build a community of us like minded individuals and give all of us a shirt we can not only look cool in but support something as well. <strong>ANTI Clothing</strong> doesn't just end there though. As a company we would like to give back. So with each series released a new cause or foundation will be selected to donate part of our proceeds to. Be it an art program in the featured artist's home town or something bigger like an independent news group we will find something worthy that needs support.</p>
<h3 class=""p3""><strong>ANTI Clothing is a company with three main goals.</strong></h3>
<ul class=""ul1"">
<li class=""li4"">To better the world we live in</li>
<li class=""li4"">To create a solid community of artists and likeminded individuals</li>
<li class=""li4"">To create cool merchandise for you guys to wear</li>
</ul>

<p class=""p2""> </p>
<h2 class=""p1""><strong>EXTRA DETAIL ON THE HOW:</strong></h2>
<p class=""p2""><strong>ANTI Clothing </strong>will start off with creating only <strong>LIMITED EDITION </strong>products. Secondly it will release everything in <strong>SERIES</strong> designed by a new artist each time, just to keep it fresh.</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>ANTI Clothing</strong> will also select a new cause or foundation that it will raise money for with each new series of merchandise released. So with every purchase you make you give back to something besides our wallets.</p>
<h2 class=""p1""><strong>So simply put...</strong></h2>
<p class=""p2"">Each <strong>SERIES</strong> of merchandise supports a new artist, donates to a cause, and creates awesome stuff for you guys. <strong>Sweet right!?</strong></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>So help make a difference and look cool while you do it!</strong></p>
<p class=""p3""> </p>
<h2 class=""p1""><strong>Heres a list of some causes and foundations we will be looking to help in the future.</strong></h2>

</div></div>","PICTURED ABOVE: All four SERIES 1 Shirts 
Hello everyone! My Name is Jason Littlefield, I am the art director and owner of ANTI Clothing. I'm here to find support for the release of my LIMITED EDITION SERIES 1 T-shirt line. I have been at this for a very long time now and have put a lot of my past experiences in retail, fashion, and art school into this.
 

Coming from a small town in Lisbon Falls, ME I know how hard one must work to make their dreams come true. I am now currently located in Orlando, FL attending a design school called Full Sail University for Digital Art & Design. I have spent all my free time away from class working on this company as it has been a dream of mine for some time now. Art and design has always been apart of my life every since I found doodling in elementary school more fun then the actual assignments. As an artist I have established myself in the small state of Maine and even have had my work showcased in the Portland Museum of Art. As for what I would like to achieve I haven't even scratched the surface and thats why I need your help.
Now a days its next to impossible to start your own t shirt company. Even with the best designs, the perfect demographic, and great marketing its hard to stick out in a market that is already so over-saturated. The same can be said about the art world, artist of all sorts pop up everyday struggling to find a solid following. So ANTI Clothing is here to try and change both of those issues by combining both worlds. They will do this by producing LIMITED EDTION clothing in small series and each series will feature a new artist. The goal with that is to build a community of us like minded individuals and give all of us a shirt we can not only look cool in but support something as well. ANTI Clothing doesn't just end there though. As a company we would like to give back. So with each series released a new cause or foundation will be selected to donate part of our proceeds to. Be it an art program in the featured artist's home town or something bigger like an independent news group we will find something worthy that needs support.
ANTI Clothing is a company with three main goals.

To better the world we live in
To create a solid community of artists and likeminded individuals
To create cool merchandise for you guys to wear

 
 
EXTRA DETAIL ON THE HOW:
ANTI Clothing will start off with creating only LIMITED EDITION products. Secondly it will release everything in SERIES designed by a new artist each time, just to keep it fresh.
ANTI Clothing will also select a new cause or foundation that it will raise money for with each new series of merchandise released. So with every purchase you make you give back to something besides our wallets.
So simply put...
Each SERIES of merchandise supports a new artist, donates to a cause, and creates awesome stuff for you guys. Sweet right!?
So help make a difference and look cool while you do it!
 
Heres a list of some causes and foundations we will be looking to help in the future.

Independent news groups
Food banks and shelters
Art programs
Veterans programs 
Make-A-Wish Foundation

 
 
What is the money from Indiegogo for?
The money being raised is to print the very first set of shirts and merchandise. We need $3200 to get the shirts, get them printed, packing completed, and get them out to you guys.
We already have a lot done and most of it will actually be available to you guys as perks just for helping out. As for everything else, it all has been accounted for from the website design to the promo videos. This is the last step in the process. The pictures below will show you some stuff we already have done.

What's in it for you guys?
Well we are giving you first dibs on our SERIES 1 products designed by artist/designer Jason Littlefield. We have a whole line from shirts to accessories ready to go for the website launch but you get to see it and buy it before it hits our digital shelves.
So by supporting you also get the actual products we will be selling to the general public in the near future!

</h2></span></h2><p>Reach is for applications when your standard GPS with several meters accuracy just won’t cut it. It relies on RTK (real-time kinematics) technology to deliver centimeter level accuracy.</p><p>RTK was here for a long time, used mostly by surveyors and unaffordable to hobbyists and makers. If you needed centimeter precise positioning you had to spend thousands of dollars on an RTK system. With Reach we want to change that.<br/></p><p>Reach runs open-source RTK processing software called <a href=""http://rtklib.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">RTKLIB</a> written by Tomoji Takasu. Previously a computer was required to run RTKLIB, but now all RTKLIB features are available directly on Reach.</p><p></p><h2>Antennas matter</h2><p></p><p><span>High quality antennas are the key to great RTK performance. <a href=""http://www.tallysman.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tallysman Wireless</a>, an industry leading company in high accuracy antennas provided their latest advanced antennas for the project. These antennas receive Glonass G1, Beidou B1, GPS L1 and Galileo E1 signals as well as signals from corrections services.</span></p><p><i>“The Emlid Reach program is an <b>excellent example of the potential for huge reductions in cost </b>available of precision RTK positioning systems. Tallysman’s Accutenna™ technology is a great match for the Reach product because it too provides high precision at new price levels.  Just as one wouldn’t expect a high quality image from an expensive TV receiver with a “rabbit ear” antenna, one should not expect the levels of precision the Reach product is capable of with a low precision antenna.

What is Reach and what is it for?
Reach is for applications when your standard GPS with several meters accuracy just won’t cut it. It relies on RTK (real-time kinematics) technology to deliver centimeter level accuracy.RTK was here for a long time, used mostly by surveyors and unaffordable to hobbyists and makers. If you needed centimeter precise positioning you had to spend thousands of dollars on an RTK system. With Reach we want to change that.Reach runs open-source RTK processing software called RTKLIB written by Tomoji Takasu. Previously a computer was required to run RTKLIB, but now all RTKLIB features are available directly on Reach.Antennas matterHigh quality antennas are the key to great RTK performance. Tallysman Wireless, an industry leading company in high accuracy antennas provided their latest advanced antennas for the project. These antennas receive Glonass G1, Beidou B1, GPS L1 and Galileo E1 signals as well as signals from corrections services.“The Emlid Reach program is an excellent example of the potential for huge reductions in cost available of precision RTK positioning systems. Tallysman’s Accutenna™ technology is a great match for the Reach product because it too provides high precision at new price levels.  Just as one wouldn’t expect a high quality image from an expensive TV receiver with a “rabbit ear” antenna, one should not expect the levels of precision the Reach product is capable of with a low precision antenna. Tallysman’s raison d’etre is production of high quality, high precision antennas at an affordable price for systems exactly such as the Emlid Reach product.”Allen Crawford Director Marketing & Sales, Antennas and RF Products, Tallysman Wireless

And thanks to its dirt and water repellent upper, your Weekend will need only light care to bounce back to box-fresh.For casual riders, we crafted it with a strengthened mid-board that makes every ride more enjoyable, whether you’re taking the long way home, or spinning to the beat. For serious commuters, Weekend supports clip-in pedal connectivity (SPD/MTB compatibility), so you can add your favourite cleats for even greater power efficiency and control. At Quoc, we pride ourselves on being an environmentally focused company. Which is why we partnered with US brand BLOOM and integrated their plant-based, performance-driven foam directly into Weekend. BLOOM takes excessive, eco-destroying algae from the environment, transforming sunlight, water and pollution into renewable plant biomass. Which means for every Weekend we make, 395 half-litre bottles of water will be returned to the environment, and 37 12” balloons of CO2 will be prevented from entering the atmosphere.Step into Weekend, and pledge to support our Indiegogo campaign today.                          Sizing Comparison | Weekend sizing is similar to the fit of many popular running shoes (within a few mm longer than most).Half Sizes | If you typically wear ½ sizes, we recommend sizing up for a more relaxed fit or sizing down for a snug fit.Full Sizes | If you typically wear a full size, we recommend the same size for the best possible fit and comfort.Size Exchanges | Getting the perfect fit can be difficult especially online. It’s our mission that you get the best possible fit with your Weekend. Send us a message and we’ll be happy to help you out with your exchange!Still not sure about your size? Here's how you can measure for the right fit.Place a piece of paper against the wall. Place one foot on the piece of paper with your heel against the wall. Trace around your feet making sure not to move your heel. Measure your marking from the highest point of your toes to the middle of the heel in cm. Take the resulting figure and compare this to our size chart above.If you're still unsure, no worries! Simply message us here on indiegogo and our friendly staff will assist you.     1. Click 'SELECT A PERK' Below: Select the available reward tier you would like to pledge. Each backer may only make one pledge.2. Payment: Enter your payment information. 3. Size, Colour & Delivery Information: Select your Size and Colour choices. Quoc has three global distribution centres: one in the UK, one in the USA and one in Taiwan. For the majority, we will ship directly from our nearest warehouses so that the shoes can be delivered to you as smoothly as possible. If import duties were to be charged, we will cover that for you entirely (applicable to only 41 countries. See the list in the FAQ). For circumstances that dictate otherwise, we will decide what's the best way to ship based on your location.    We have a dedicated logistics team handling your return and exchange requests to make sure you receive the right shoes smoothly with as little hassle as possible. *Please note: customers will be responsible for exchange shipping cost: £10 for the UK and continental USA / £15 for all other countries.  Why Indiegogo?Some people have asked us, ""Quoc is a fully functioning footwear brand with retailers and its own online store - why are we releasing products on Indiegogo?""

Since our launch on Kickstarter in 2017, we have been turning thousands of goatskins previously wasted by the UK food industry into exceptional British-made goat leather goods. But we now face our biggest challenge yet, to move our micro-tannery.   We have spent the year designing and developing a new range of products and have begun production, but then we heard some unexpected news. The farm that our micro-tannery is located on has been sold and we have been given notice to leave.  The good news is we have found an amazing new site and started the groundworks, but we urgently need to raise the funds to complete the move. In return for your support we are offering exclusive Indiegogo prices on our new range of products, plus some fantastic perks in collaboration with our friends and collaborators.________________________________________________________________________– WASTE INTO WORTH – Billy Tannery started with a question. In a world of increasing demand for sustainable materials, how could we be wasting such a fantastic natural by-product?Most ‘luxury' leather goods brands rely on sprawling global supply chains, with materials and products made in questionable environmental and ethical conditions. We believe in another way.At Billy Tannery our supply chain is as small as possible, so we can keep a close eye on all of the details. From farm to tannery to workshop to you.Choose a better leather. Promote the goat.1,2.Our goat leather can be traced back to just two farms, one in Lancashire, the other in Somerset. Both rear dairy billies for award-winning goat meat supplier, Cabrito.3.The goatskins are then tanned using our own low- impact mimosa bark process in our micro-tannery, the first of its kind in the UK.4.Once tanned, the skins are dyed and finished at a local family-run leather finishing company just down the road in Northamptonshire.5,6Our products are made in two small workshops in Somerset and Leicestershire. Both carefully chosenfor their passion, craftsmanship and consistency.________________________________________________________________________– NEW PRODUCTS –•THE CARDHOLDER 2.0 Now featuring an extra card pocket and a more practical shape, our new cardholder is perfect for those who want to keep things minimal.Early Bird: £40, Indiegogo: £45, RRP: £50 Features:3 card pockets, thin construction, semi-circular notches for easier access to cards.Dimensions:105mm x 70mmAvailable colours:(black, chestnut, navy, forest, natural)•THE BIFOLD By popular demand our new bifold wallet has been designed for those who have that little bit extra to carry each day.

These jackets are durable enough to shield your body from a deluge, yet athletic enough to let you move without a problem. However, the potential (invisible) problems are:Sweat contains bacteria that grows quickly and makes the jacket smell.If you are exposed to a complex environment when running/jogging/cycling etc. , microbes will adhere to the surface of the jacket and can then be taken into your home or anywhere else.It is very rare to find jackets that are designed with face protection to block out raindrops, wind, dust and even airborne particles & substances.INTRODUCING PERXFEATURE COMPARISONPerX is one of the Most Affordable and Functional Performance Jacket.No need to worry about wear PerX even in the summer. The PerX A is thin and designed ideally for hot temperatures [up to 35C/95F] with 20,000 g/m2/24hrs for breathability and UPF 50+ for sun protection while PerX B is the pro version to keep you performing at your best.And YES! The price includes EVERYTHING. You DON""T NEED to pay extra Shipping Fee or TAX/VAT.PerX is made from antimicrobial fabric that is strictly tested and certified by INTERTEK. It can reduce 99% of bacteria.How antimicrobial works This is achieved by treating the fabric with the latest proprietary chemicals [Permanent Coating Technology into the fibers of the fabric]  that inhibit the growth of pathogens and using yarns that are especially designed to provide inbuilt microscopic antibacterial functionality. By combining these properties, the yarns help stop microbes from developing, while simultaneously promoting moisture flows, thereby maximizing comfort and extending the life of the fabric.PerX is especially designed with extra parts [longer neck area to cover the nose] to block raindrops, wind, dust and airborne particles & substances.The hood and hem feature a drawstring design, along with Velcro cuffs that tighten and keep users extra secure in any conditions.  The back pocket of PerX is designed to pack the jacket into itself, making it very convenient for users to carry their PerX with them, in any bag. PerX is a 2-layer performance jacket featuring a TPU/PTFE membrane, which is 20k waterproof and 20k breathable according to JIS.We also know how important pockets are for a functional jacket. There are 6 outer pockets featuring waterproof zips to store personal belongings.The main zip is featuring YKK 2-way zip, which is also waterproof and seam taping to protect against harsh weather conditions.Technically, PerX A is thinner than PerX B. They are both made from antimicrobial fabrics and are both 2-layer performance jackets. PerX B, featuring PTFE membrane [better than TPU], is the pro version to keep you performing the best while the PerX A is ideally designed for hot temperatures while still keeping you feel breathable.Male Model - 186CM, 80KG - Size L - Slim fit [SIze XL is recommended for a regular fit]Female Model - 170CM, 45KG - Size XL - Loose Fit [Size S/M is recommended for a regular fit]   PerX A and PerX B Demo Video PLAYFor us, the PerX idea is indeed a brilliant one that originally came from George, who's the CMO as well as a bike commuter.

<p><strong><i>FACTS</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Stress and fatigue</i></strong> generate a high number of free radicals in our body. Free radicals destroy the body's cells and have become the number one killer of health! Moreover, pressure and tension tend to speed up the body's sympathetic activities, causing vasoconstriction that increases blood pressure. Over time, these activities can turn into chronic diseases such as high blood pressure. It is important to learn about our pressure and fatigue at work, and how to deal with them.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Health Data are collected by heart rate variability (HRV) that analyze the state of the autonomic nerve. Having accurate health data helps you better understand your current body and mind conditions. What is even more interesting is that, research papers in the United States has found correlations between heart rate and personality. At the same time, we have found the algorithm of coincidence factor from the long-term experiment of HRV frequency, which can be applied in daily life. Trio launches the world's exclusive patented ""HRV"" feature to test the “psychic fit” between you and your friends, expand your social circles, and help you find your ""Buddies”.</p>

<p><strong>1. PWTT Blood Pressure Technology</strong></p>
<p>Pulse wave transmission rate and blood pressure are positively correlated. High blood pressure induces fast pulse wave transmission, otherwise slow. The pulse wave transit time (PWTT) can be obtained through the ECG signal and the pulse signal PPG to further calculate the blood pressure value. With the advance in technology, the PWTT technology can now be embedded in the bracelet. This invention greatly increase the convenience of blood pressure measurement.</p>
<p>The blood pressure data is measured by placing the index finger on the screen's electrode pad, at this moment, the other electrode pad at the bottom of the bracelet touches the wrist, the green light sensor then activates, and the data calculation starts. </p>

FACTS
Stress and fatigue generate a high number of free radicals in our body. Free radicals destroy the body's cells and have become the number one killer of health! Moreover, pressure and tension tend to speed up the body's sympathetic activities, causing vasoconstriction that increases blood pressure. Over time, these activities can turn into chronic diseases such as high blood pressure. It is important to learn about our pressure and fatigue at work, and how to deal with them.


General
Trio is a powerful yet economical smart health bracelet. With an innovative design, Trio measures the user’s heart rate and blood pressure by recording down all the values and save in report for further reference. Through its well designed Coherent breath training and exercises to reduce the stress and fatigue. Moreover, Trio’s unique ""HRV Soul matching” function - matching the ""fit"" users who also have Trio nearby and connect them for further social activities - makes Trio the only smart bracelet in the world with social networking functions. 

 
Trio measures three major data - ECG, Heart rate with high accuracy and PWTT blood pressure for reference. And it’s so easy to use. Trio can automatically records the user’s heart rate data 24 hours a day. Having these data as a reference, the you can adjust your lifestyle from work to rest any time he needs it. It becomes easier and more effective to reach the physical and mental health balance.

Autonomic Nervous System
Many lifestyle diseases are caused by Autonomic dysfunction. Trio’s ""WynHeart"" APP not only records your heart rate variability data, but it further analyzes your current autonomic nervous state by indexing it into mental pressure index, fatigue index, physical fitness, physical and mental load index. All these functions allow you to fully understand your own health status, and help you adjust timely and effectively to stay away from *sub-health. 
Note: Sub-health, a state between health and disease when all necessary physical and chemical indexes are tested negative by medical equipment, things seem normal but the person experiences all kind of discomforts and even pain.
 

This WynHeart APP supports iOS 8.0 and Android 4.4 phones.

SoulMatch
The unique and innovative ""Soul matching"" function enables you to test your “fit” among the Trio's adopters. Its design principle is to analyze the  measured heart rate variability (HRV) spectrum transform to personal traits for mutual pairing.This function connects friends who are willing to monitor one another’s health, and work together as a team while enjoying social connections! Only true experts with the ability to analyze the heart rhythm variation could invent such technology. Our patent is on the way! 

 
Health Data are collected by heart rate variability (HRV) that analyze the state of the autonomic nerve. Having accurate health data helps you better understand your current body and mind conditions. What is even more interesting is that, research papers in the United States has found correlations between heart rate and personality. At the same time, we have found the algorithm of coincidence factor from the long-term experiment of HRV frequency, which can be applied in daily life. Trio launches the world's exclusive patented ""HRV"" feature to test the “psychic fit” between you and your friends, expand your social circles, and help you find your ""Buddies”.

Our story began in 2016 when I was struggling with <strong>depression </strong>while studying at Lynn University.</p><p>At first, I turned to anxiety pills, but ultimately they did not work out. I felt I could not get out of that hole and got deeper into it. As a man, I felt like there was some pressure not to speak out about what I was going through. It is seen as a taboo to speak out about one's mental health. Men are often told not to cry or show weakness because it ""takes away from our masculinity"" but that is simply not the case. I knew I had to be honest about my mental health, and started to explore other options to treat my anxiety. It was then that I found my <strong>Chief Dog Officer Remi</strong>, the Weimaraner. A 90 lbs. bundle of love, loyalty, happiness, and respect. He came into my life at my lowest and helped me rebuild my life from nothing. Since then, aside from being my emotional support dog, he's been my best friend and companion.</p><p>Ultimately, Remi is the one that truly saved my life through his loyalty and support. It is then that I realized the importance of having a companion such as Remi. This experience pushed me to search for ways in which I could give back. <strong>My daily question was, If Remi saved my life, then why can't I come up with a business that saves other dogs' lives?</strong></p><p><strong>Love, Loyalty, Respect, and Empathy are the pillars on which I founded The Fetch Co.</strong> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1602258504/mvbnowljgj06fsm77sj2.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Our Mission and Vision</strong></h2><p>Our Mission is to give back by <strong>donating 20%</strong> of all our profits to organizations supporting stray and malnourished dogs.</p><p>The <strong>""Connect with a Pooch""</strong> program is a program that we plan to create in 2023 with the dogs that we will have supported by then and connect them with individuals that struggle with mental health and are in need of a companion.</p><p>Our Vision at Fetch is to become a worldwide known brand that can help different organizations around the world as well as to create the Fetch Foundation, a foundation dedicated to protecting dogs from abuse and to help people with mental health issues find a best friend that will love them unconditionally. </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601311186/fr4s0sd2uxwhwspeblsl.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601306458/i05gescf1srboftpoxuj.png"" src=""""/></p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Why is the campaign so important?</strong></h2><p>Being a person that suffered from depression and got saved by a dog made me realize that through the <strong>creation of different fetch collections we could do good</strong>.

</ul></div>","The Story Behind The BrandHi, my name is Gabriel Anzueto, and I am the Founder of The Fetch Co. - a sustainable clothing brand. Our story began in 2016 when I was struggling with depression while studying at Lynn University.At first, I turned to anxiety pills, but ultimately they did not work out. I felt I could not get out of that hole and got deeper into it. As a man, I felt like there was some pressure not to speak out about what I was going through. It is seen as a taboo to speak out about one's mental health. Men are often told not to cry or show weakness because it ""takes away from our masculinity"" but that is simply not the case. I knew I had to be honest about my mental health, and started to explore other options to treat my anxiety. It was then that I found my Chief Dog Officer Remi, the Weimaraner. A 90 lbs. bundle of love, loyalty, happiness, and respect. He came into my life at my lowest and helped me rebuild my life from nothing. Since then, aside from being my emotional support dog, he's been my best friend and companion.Ultimately, Remi is the one that truly saved my life through his loyalty and support. It is then that I realized the importance of having a companion such as Remi. This experience pushed me to search for ways in which I could give back. My daily question was, If Remi saved my life, then why can't I come up with a business that saves other dogs' lives?Love, Loyalty, Respect, and Empathy are the pillars on which I founded The Fetch Co. Our Mission and VisionOur Mission is to give back by donating 20% of all our profits to organizations supporting stray and malnourished dogs.The ""Connect with a Pooch"" program is a program that we plan to create in 2023 with the dogs that we will have supported by then and connect them with individuals that struggle with mental health and are in need of a companion.Our Vision at Fetch is to become a worldwide known brand that can help different organizations around the world as well as to create the Fetch Foundation, a foundation dedicated to protecting dogs from abuse and to help people with mental health issues find a best friend that will love them unconditionally.   Why is the campaign so important?Being a person that suffered from depression and got saved by a dog made me realize that through the creation of different fetch collections we could do good. It is so important for us to give back that we will pledge to always give back 20% of our profits. Our Casual Apparel is perfect for those long walks with your best friend, snuggly Netflix nights with your pooch, and of course the long mornings in bed. Dogs have become such an important part of our lives so its our duty to give them more love than they give us.COVID-19 has affected us all, imagine the detrimental effect it has had on stray dogs that lived through the feeding of tourists. What You, the crowdfunding Founders will Help us achieve?

Each watch has a significant and solid feel, and the chambered body is made from precision-machined stainless steel, topped off with a sapphire crystal lens. A JUST watch, in any of five versions, perfectly fuses the metal case, the metal dial, and the leather or sturdy NATO nylon strap to give a certain masculinity to the wearer.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503338950/gfldp6j5pdmhidgocjse.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>From a wrist presence perspective, the watch has unique and minimalistic styling. It has the size and weight to grab the attention of those around it without being intrusive. The casing is flat and angled to your face. In fact, it is much thicker at the 12 o’clock side of the watch. This has the effect of positioning the watch face at such an angle that allows the wearer to look at the time without needing to turn the wrist.</p><p>The watch is fitted with a solid screw-in case back which is engraved with specifications. Behind the case back lies the Miyota GL30 Japanese Quartz Movement made by the Miyota division of Citizen LTD.</p><p>The watch is water resistant to 3ATM (to 30m/100ft) and comes with a full two-year warranty.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503402709/fzj509hxm0ym8wk3xwaz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>Highlights</strong></p><p>The new KIBARDIN 'JUST' watch collection is based on numerous values, a passion for achievement, and the quest for technical and aesthetic excellence. We hope to give rise to a collection of exceptional watches that will have success among connoisseurs and devotees of future-oriented watches. The KIBARDIN timepieces line is shifting up a level with new watches endowed with high quality technology and designs.</p><p>Dedicated to the world of the brave, the independent, and the strong, the JUST watch’s powerful and refined aesthetic pays homage to the various reliability and design hallmarks of vehicle dashboards and lifesaving apparatus.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503403317/scq2seqd9jwzsuspa0ci.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>A JUST watch, a universal watch.</strong></p><p>We made the watch in a truncated cylinder shape case with the crown placed at the top, above the 12 o’clock position. Traditionally, the crown is positioned on the right side of the case, at the 3 o‘clock or 4 o’clock position. Some watches even place the crown on the left side at the 9 o‘clock position.

One year ago we produced 1,000 pcs. and successfully sold them to our 1,000 international fans. Join to our team and become the owner of the unique design timepiece from the second edition.THERE IS A 'JUST WATCH' FOR EVERYONE.Consider one of these inspiring watches if you want to make reading the time easier and quicker. Each watch has a significant and solid feel, and the chambered body is made from precision-machined stainless steel, topped off with a sapphire crystal lens. A JUST watch, in any of five versions, perfectly fuses the metal case, the metal dial, and the leather or sturdy NATO nylon strap to give a certain masculinity to the wearer.From a wrist presence perspective, the watch has unique and minimalistic styling. It has the size and weight to grab the attention of those around it without being intrusive. The casing is flat and angled to your face. In fact, it is much thicker at the 12 o’clock side of the watch. This has the effect of positioning the watch face at such an angle that allows the wearer to look at the time without needing to turn the wrist.The watch is fitted with a solid screw-in case back which is engraved with specifications. Behind the case back lies the Miyota GL30 Japanese Quartz Movement made by the Miyota division of Citizen LTD.The watch is water resistant to 3ATM (to 30m/100ft) and comes with a full two-year warranty.HighlightsThe new KIBARDIN 'JUST' watch collection is based on numerous values, a passion for achievement, and the quest for technical and aesthetic excellence. We hope to give rise to a collection of exceptional watches that will have success among connoisseurs and devotees of future-oriented watches. The KIBARDIN timepieces line is shifting up a level with new watches endowed with high quality technology and designs.Dedicated to the world of the brave, the independent, and the strong, the JUST watch’s powerful and refined aesthetic pays homage to the various reliability and design hallmarks of vehicle dashboards and lifesaving apparatus.A JUST watch, a universal watch.We made the watch in a truncated cylinder shape case with the crown placed at the top, above the 12 o’clock position. Traditionally, the crown is positioned on the right side of the case, at the 3 o‘clock or 4 o’clock position. Some watches even place the crown on the left side at the 9 o‘clock position. The crown position KIBARDIN has chosen is very exceptional.Your watch is with you whenever you need time functions - you are face to face with it every time you slide behind the wheel. Its shape is integral to its function. A watch should be easy and pleasing to look at, as well as look cool in your car.Due to the crown’s novel position, the watch can be worn on the left or right wrist, and you can read the time without needing to turn your wrist while your hands are on the steering wheel, on the desk during a business meeting or rendezvous, or working hard with tools.Decide which wrist you would prefer to wear your watch on. Choose the wrist that is most comfortable and where your watch won't hamper your movements. This is typically your non-dominant hand, but the choice is up to the wearer.The watch dial speaks to your personality.When choosing a watch, it is important to consider the type of dial, its aesthetic and functionality. The dial is the first thing people notice, and is the focal point for the watch’s style. The five JUST watch faces contain the hour and minute markers and were created in five classic Arabic numeral and stick combinations. The natural affinities between the five dials are based on the main visual representations of the JUST watch style. The range of five minimalistic Black and White printed faces means everybody can choose a watch that will cultivate their own style and prestige.Each dial design is created in limited edition with no more than 200 pieces.Just Watch W-D3 Just Watch W-D1

<p>Following on from my successful campaigns for the Shuttl Dockable Wallet &amp; the Oak Bark Leather Belt, I'd love to craft you a beautiful belt with a unique, eye-catching buckle design modelled on my 19th century Fire Brigade vintage original. The prototypes for these have proved to be real talking-points.</p>
<p>As usual, there will be no short-cuts taken - your belt will be hand-made from the finest English oak-bark tanned bridle leather with solid brass buckles &amp; fittings.</p>

<h3>Introducing The Firefighter Belt</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509387768/fwvdm4py2gkg8gozuzx3.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I make high-quality leather goods so when I came across this old leather belt with an unusual buckle at a flea market a few years ago I couldn’t resist buying it. I was intrigued as to its original purpose &amp; set about doing some research. </p>
<p>Fortunately the buckle had a maker’s stamp reading ‘Morris Salford’. My research showed that John Morris &amp; Sons of Salford, Manchester, England were a leading manufacturer of all types of firefighting equipment from the late 1800s &amp; into the 20th century.   </p>
<p>The company were highly conscious of the fact that speed is of the essence &amp; that every second lost in the early stages of fighting a fire is crucial. With that in mind, they came up with these innovative buckles that could be used to hold fire hoses firmly in place but which could be released in a fraction of a second, saving valuable time. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509387819/ywfor3xriaexq9iyy1n9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>It’s believed that firefighters would sometimes fit these cool-looking buckles to the belts they used to hold up their trousers. </p>
<p>I've decided to bring this look back to life by having the buckles faithfully recreated. I’ve now managed to locate a traditional foundry here in England that can make these unique buckles for you by sand-casting them in solid brass. I’ll then turn them into belts using the same fantastic oak-bark tanned English bridle leather that I use for all my belts.</p>
<p>Incidentally, although the buckle has a quick-release feature, it can also be fastened &amp; unfastened in the usual way just like a normal buckle. That's how I use it - although if you ever do need to undo your belt in a hurry, the option's there! It's also a great talking-point with an interesting back-story. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509387888/otnbnxrqec7b9z0agved.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Want to know more?  </strong></p>
<p>Backers of my previous projects already know that the leather goods I produce are designed &amp; made to last. The leather &amp; hardware used are always of the highest possible quality. Team that up with my handmade, old-school construction methods &amp; you’ve got a recipe for a product that will go on forever.  </p>
<p>So...what does it take to make the best looking, longest lasting belts?</p>
<p>• Great leather, tanned using oak bark in a very long, slow process  <br/>• Solid, foundry-cast brass fittings  <br/>• Thoughtful design   <br/>• Skilled craftsmanship</p>
<p><strong>1. Great leather</strong></p>
<p>I use the finest of full-grain English bridle leathers. Tanned in Britain’s last remaining traditional tannery using oak bark &amp; river water in a long, slow process that results in light, strong, beautiful leather. This really is the best belting leather I’ve ever seen. If it was a car it would be an Aston Martin. Backers of my previous belt project already know first-hand how great this leather is but, for those who'd like to know more, I've added a video &amp; more details lower down the page.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509387978/nvmbhikevj84y05sv95h.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>2. Rugged hardware</strong></p>
<p>Buckles &amp; fittings used are solid brass, sand-cast &amp; hand-finished in a traditional foundry here in the UK. Super-strong &amp; great-looking, simple and honest. None of those cheap, brittle zinc alloy buckles used in most belts available in stores, whose plating peels off and starts to look scruffy in no time.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509388034/kb7vai8q2k7ymnviteuv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>3. Solid construction</strong></p>
<p>I attach the buckles with tough, solid brass Chicago screws. From the front they look just like rivets but besides being stronger than most rivets, they’re removable, allowing for easy future changes of buckles if required, whilst avoiding the possibility of stitch holes weakening the leather or stitches wearing out or rotting away.  </p>

<p><strong>4. Thoughtful design</strong></p>
<p>Every part of these belts has been carefully considered. From the use of chicago screws to attach the buckles &amp; the placement of those screws, to the carefully finished edges and even the oval shape of the holes that allow the prong of the buckle to lay flatter for a more comfortable fit.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509388140/l79qgddx5wsl2jquetqp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>5. Skilled craftsmanship</strong></p>
<p>Every stage of the making process is carried out by hand right here in my own workshop. Most belts, even the most expensive, have the edges either left raw &amp; ragged or coated with a thick layer of rubbery goo that eventually starts to crack &amp; peel off. It makes no sense to me when a product’s quality is compromised in the interests of saving money. I believe that great materials deserve great craftsmanship so the edges of my belts are bevelled, dyed to match and finally burnished to perfection. It’s a labour-intensive process but I wouldn’t do it any other way. No rough or raw edges here!  </p>

<p>Three colours of leather are available - London Tan, Dark Oak and Black. These cover pretty much any shoe colour you may wish to co-ordinate with. All look great with jeans but the darker shades also work well with more formal wear. Just to be clear and to avoid any confusion, you can choose any colour, in any length and with any of the 2 buckle finishes - natural brass or nickel-plated brass.</p>

<p>All belts are 1.5 inches (38mm) wide. The belts come in two-inch increments. 26"" 28"" 30"" 32"" 34"" 36"" 38"" 40"" 42"" 44"" 46"" 48"" These sizes are measured from the end of the buckle to the centre hole of the five adjustment holes on the belt. This will give you two inches either way, allowing you to go up or down by 2"" in waist size and still fit the belt.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509388570/flnhbggiyqo0vbrbo5g7.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE This measurement almost certainly won't be the same as your waist size or the size you buy your jeans in! This is because most people wear their trousers more on their hips than their waist and also because, if you measured yourself over the top of a pair of trousers, you'd find that the measurement was likely a couple of inches more than expected because of the added bulk of the fabric. So...in order to ensure a perfect fit first time, the absolute best way to find out what size belt you need is to measure a belt you already own and which fits you well. Go from the outer end of the buckle to the hole that you normally use. This is the measurement that we need to know. We'll make your new belt this same length, to the centre hole. If you don't own a belt that fits you, don't worry - you'll receive comprehensive measuring instructions with the backer's survey after the campaign closes.  </p>

<p>What is oak bark leather? <br/>Tucked away in the south west of England there’s a small leather tannery beside a river. There’s been a tannery there since Roman legionnaires were marching past, en-route to the local garrison and it’s been in the ownership of the current family for more than 150 years.  </p>
<p>Whereas over 95% of leather produced these days is tanned with chromium because it’s fast and cheap (it’s done in one day), this tannery continues to produce leather in the same way it did some two thousand years ago.  </p>
<p>Using nothing more than river water and sustainably-produced shredded bark from English oak trees, the tanning process takes a full 18 months from locally sourced hides arriving to finished leather leaving.  </p>
<p>This leather is truly wonderful. The slow, gentle, natural tanning process preserves the strength of the fibres and produces leather that’s light, super- strong, great-smelling and has a beautiful full surface grain. It’s used in bespoke shoes, saddles and luggage by artisans and makers around the world who, like me, having once discovered it, won’t use anything else. It’s the highest quality belting leather I’ve ever seen but it’s worth every penny. Incidentally, because this is full-grain leather it will sometimes carry marks picked up during the cow’s lifetime. From thorn-bush scratches to mosquito bites or stretch marks, these things aren’t imperfections to be sanded away, weakening the leather as is often done. I prefer to see them as badges of honour that showcase each product's natural individuality and handcrafted nature. They aren’t flaws or faults, they simply tell a little of the story of the life the animal has led.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509388782/gcmu77c9uhqlex1wm5vr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>No matter how good the leather is, for belt use it also needs to be thick enough. Thinner belts will deform &amp; stretch but the oak bark leather I use is between 4mm and 5mm thick (between 10 and 12oz). What does this mean in practice though? Well, the average proper leather belt you’ll find on sale is usually around 2mm and will last up to 5 years if you’re lucky. A better one will be approaching 3mm thick &amp; might give you a decade or two of service whilst costing you as much (or more) as my Oak Bark Belt. You’ve most likely never seen a leather belt of this thickness. If you want to hang a holster from it, go ahead – it’ll handle it just fine.</p>

<p>Time to get down to business! <br/>I want to make sure it's worth your while ordering here &amp; benefiting from the economies of scale &amp; cost savings from bulk ordering of materials that a Kickstarter campaign can provide. For that reason, I'm going to offer substantial reductions on the pricing that'll be on my website afterwards.</p>
<p>You can order multiples of belts in any combination of colours and sizes so if you're buying more for gifts or you're ordering together with some workmates, you'll make even bigger savings. </p>
<p>Free shipping is included to anywhere in the world. As I'm in Britain, Kickstarter makes me display prices in GB Pounds but I'll do my best to convert to USD at current rates. </p>

</div></div>","Following on from my successful campaigns for the Shuttl Dockable Wallet & the Oak Bark Leather Belt, I'd love to craft you a beautiful belt with a unique, eye-catching buckle design modelled on my 19th century Fire Brigade vintage original. The prototypes for these have proved to be real talking-points.
As usual, there will be no short-cuts taken - your belt will be hand-made from the finest English oak-bark tanned bridle leather with solid brass buckles & fittings.
  


Introducing The Firefighter Belt

I make high-quality leather goods so when I came across this old leather belt with an unusual buckle at a flea market a few years ago I couldn’t resist buying it. I was intrigued as to its original purpose & set about doing some research. 
Fortunately the buckle had a maker’s stamp reading ‘Morris Salford’. My research showed that John Morris & Sons of Salford, Manchester, England were a leading manufacturer of all types of firefighting equipment from the late 1800s & into the 20th century.   
The company were highly conscious of the fact that speed is of the essence & that every second lost in the early stages of fighting a fire is crucial. With that in mind, they came up with these innovative buckles that could be used to hold fire hoses firmly in place but which could be released in a fraction of a second, saving valuable time. 

It’s believed that firefighters would sometimes fit these cool-looking buckles to the belts they used to hold up their trousers. 
I've decided to bring this look back to life by having the buckles faithfully recreated. I’ve now managed to locate a traditional foundry here in England that can make these unique buckles for you by sand-casting them in solid brass. I’ll then turn them into belts using the same fantastic oak-bark tanned English bridle leather that I use for all my belts.
Incidentally, although the buckle has a quick-release feature, it can also be fastened & unfastened in the usual way just like a normal buckle. That's how I use it - although if you ever do need to undo your belt in a hurry, the option's there! It's also a great talking-point with an interesting back-story. 

Want to know more?  
Backers of my previous projects already know that the leather goods I produce are designed & made to last. The leather & hardware used are always of the highest possible quality. Team that up with my handmade, old-school construction methods & you’ve got a recipe for a product that will go on forever.  
So...what does it take to make the best looking, longest lasting belts?
• Great leather, tanned using oak bark in a very long, slow process  • Solid, foundry-cast brass fittings  • Thoughtful design   • Skilled craftsmanship
1. Great leather
I use the finest of full-grain English bridle leathers. Tanned in Britain’s last remaining traditional tannery using oak bark & river water in a long, slow process that results in light, strong, beautiful leather. This really is the best belting leather I’ve ever seen. If it was a car it would be an Aston Martin. Backers of my previous belt project already know first-hand how great this leather is but, for those who'd like to know more, I've added a video & more details lower down the page.

2. Rugged hardware
Buckles & fittings used are solid brass, sand-cast & hand-finished in a traditional foundry here in the UK. Super-strong & great-looking, simple and honest. None of those cheap, brittle zinc alloy buckles used in most belts available in stores, whose plating peels off and starts to look scruffy in no time.  

3. Solid construction
I attach the buckles with tough, solid brass Chicago screws. From the front they look just like rivets but besides being stronger than most rivets, they’re removable, allowing for easy future changes of buckles if required, whilst avoiding the possibility of stitch holes weakening the leather or stitches wearing out or rotting away.  

4. Thoughtful design
Every part of these belts has been carefully considered. From the use of chicago screws to attach the buckles & the placement of those screws, to the carefully finished edges and even the oval shape of the holes that allow the prong of the buckle to lay flatter for a more comfortable fit.

5. Skilled craftsmanship
Every stage of the making process is carried out by hand right here in my own workshop. Most belts, even the most expensive, have the edges either left raw & ragged or coated with a thick layer of rubbery goo that eventually starts to crack & peel off. It makes no sense to me when a product’s quality is compromised in the interests of saving money. I believe that great materials deserve great craftsmanship so the edges of my belts are bevelled, dyed to match and finally burnished to perfection. It’s a labour-intensive process but I wouldn’t do it any other way. No rough or raw edges here!  




Three colours of leather are available - London Tan, Dark Oak and Black. These cover pretty much any shoe colour you may wish to co-ordinate with. All look great with jeans but the darker shades also work well with more formal wear. Just to be clear and to avoid any confusion, you can choose any colour, in any length and with any of the 2 buckle finishes - natural brass or nickel-plated brass.






All belts are 1.5 inches (38mm) wide. The belts come in two-inch increments. 26"" 28"" 30"" 32"" 34"" 36"" 38"" 40"" 42"" 44"" 46"" 48"" These sizes are measured from the end of the buckle to the centre hole of the five adjustment holes on the belt. This will give you two inches either way, allowing you to go up or down by 2"" in waist size and still fit the belt.

PLEASE NOTE This measurement almost certainly won't be the same as your waist size or the size you buy your jeans in! This is because most people wear their trousers more on their hips than their waist and also because, if you measured yourself over the top of a pair of trousers, you'd find that the measurement was likely a couple of inches more than expected because of the added bulk of the fabric. So...in order to ensure a perfect fit first time, the absolute best way to find out what size belt you need is to measure a belt you already own and which fits you well. Go from the outer end of the buckle to the hole that you normally use. This is the measurement that we need to know. We'll make your new belt this same length, to the centre hole. If you don't own a belt that fits you, don't worry - you'll receive comprehensive measuring instructions with the backer's survey after the campaign closes.  



What is oak bark leather? Tucked away in the south west of England there’s a small leather tannery beside a river. There’s been a tannery there since Roman legionnaires were marching past, en-route to the local garrison and it’s been in the ownership of the current family for more than 150 years.  
Whereas over 95% of leather produced these days is tanned with chromium because it’s fast and cheap (it’s done in one day), this tannery continues to produce leather in the same way it did some two thousand years ago.  
Using nothing more than river water and sustainably-produced shredded bark from English oak trees, the tanning process takes a full 18 months from locally sourced hides arriving to finished leather leaving.  
This leather is truly wonderful. The slow, gentle, natural tanning process preserves the strength of the fibres and produces leather that’s light, super- strong, great-smelling and has a beautiful full surface grain. It’s used in bespoke shoes, saddles and luggage by artisans and makers around the world who, like me, having once discovered it, won’t use anything else. It’s the highest quality belting leather I’ve ever seen but it’s worth every penny. Incidentally, because this is full-grain leather it will sometimes carry marks picked up during the cow’s lifetime. From thorn-bush scratches to mosquito bites or stretch marks, these things aren’t imperfections to be sanded away, weakening the leather as is often done. I prefer to see them as badges of honour that showcase each product's natural individuality and handcrafted nature. They aren’t flaws or faults, they simply tell a little of the story of the life the animal has led.

No matter how good the leather is, for belt use it also needs to be thick enough. Thinner belts will deform & stretch but the oak bark leather I use is between 4mm and 5mm thick (between 10 and 12oz). What does this mean in practice though? Well, the average proper leather belt you’ll find on sale is usually around 2mm and will last up to 5 years if you’re lucky. A better one will be approaching 3mm thick & might give you a decade or two of service whilst costing you as much (or more) as my Oak Bark Belt. You’ve most likely never seen a leather belt of this thickness. If you want to hang a holster from it, go ahead – it’ll handle it just fine.


Time to get down to business! I want to make sure it's worth your while ordering here & benefiting from the economies of scale & cost savings from bulk ordering of materials that a Kickstarter campaign can provide. For that reason, I'm going to offer substantial reductions on the pricing that'll be on my website afterwards.
You can order multiples of belts in any combination of colours and sizes so if you're buying more for gifts or you're ordering together with some workmates, you'll make even bigger savings. 
Free shipping is included to anywhere in the world. As I'm in Britain, Kickstarter makes me display prices in GB Pounds but I'll do my best to convert to USD at current rates. 
1 Belt: £75 (approx $98 or 84 Euros) (£110 later, saving of £35) 2 Belts: £145 (approx $189 or 162 Euros) (£220 later, saving of £75) 3 Belts: £209 (approx $273 or 234 Euros) (£330 later, saving of £121) 4 Belts: £269 (approx $352 or 301 Euros) (£440 later, saving of £171) 5 Belts: £329 (approx $431 or 368 Euros) (£550 later, saving of £221)

More than hours, minutes, seconds; everyone should be reminded to live in every moment. That is the ‘Different Time’ experience; recreated in a watch that will remind us to live now, without overthinking the past nor the future.The design highlights the seconds' hand on the face of the watch; allowing us to feel speed prior to knowing the time. What seems paradoxical is actually an attempt to recall you to live in the present as if it were a different time. More than a fashionable and useful accessory; SILICA establishes an emotional relationship with the user.Down in history rests the sun, the sand, and the water as major time tracking tools. SILICA refers to these core elements and the environment where they coexist. The sand’s mineral – silica – as brand identity, and its blend with water and sun, symbolized in the Portuguese beaches that name the different models in this collection.Founders CollectionThe Founders Collection includes 6 watch models named after some of the most outstanding Portuguese beaches. This collection favors comfort and simplicity coupled with a classic but versatile design, both for women (36mm) and men (42mm).Mood board PerksGo-to-marketSILICA’s journey started in late-2018 as a result of an ideation session between friends that believed in starting their own walk for financial independence.In 2019, SILICA went through a period of concept and product development; resulting in what is being presented today.During this time, manufacturing was secured from a highly ranked manufacturer with comprehensive experience developing projects in this scope.Multiple suppliers were tested to be sure SILICA watches were being manufactured with the best components by an experienced and credible team. A variety of prototypes and samples have been tested; having little uncertainty today about the look and feel that is going to be shipped to you.Early in 2020, most of the funding was secured from private equity holders and the crowdfunding campaign has been launched today after being delayed 2-months due to the covid-19 outbreak.As soon as SILICA’s crowdfunding campaign is finished, a production order will be placed to include all the units for the campaign backers as well as enough units for year 1 sales.Having a time-to-market of about 4 months, SILICA is expected to start selling in October-2020. On this date, backers will also receive their watches and perks at the given address.SILICA is a 100% digital company, looking to make all its sales through digital channels.The team behind SILICA is already working on the development of the different distribution channels and they will keep you up to date on their progress through its social media and newsletter.A series of news and pre-launch campaigns are also being projected, so be sure you are part of it.Funding needsSILICA has secured most of the funding requirements to be launched and to be live during its year 1 sales.The additional funds will allow the team to improve its sales and marketing effectiveness, speeding up the sales funnel, the design of a new watch collection, and the design of a new product line.Risk ManagementAt this point, the uncertainty around product launch is minimal. The final samples are 99% market-ready and there is no design or technological breakthrough that still needs to be worked out.Every single unit is subject to a thorough quality check before leaving the assembly factory.

<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Hi! Alisa here. I am a hobby artist from Tallinn, Estonia. Been doodling around for some time and I feel like I am ready to jump to the next level.</p>
<p>I want to transform my art to colorful enamel lapel pins. Something tangible and wearable, perfect size for my doodles and a nice way to send a message to the world. As a result of numerous brainstorms the idea of this pin collection was formed. Although these fellas were all born in different times, they for sure have one important thing in common - they were perfect spirit lifters just when most needed!</p>
<p>So here I am sharing my set of Emotional Support Pins with you, hoping that with your support these pins can brighten everyone’s day as well.</p>
<p>Expressing struggles that we all encounter in our daily life, these pins strive to be personally relevant to every owner. Pins’ design reflect my doodling style: cheerful and silly, but ultimately soft and caring.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527002211/a3oeyyi4jh7i3mphrlqq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>With this campaign I want to fulfill my dream and make the very first batch of custom enamel pins. The initial plan is to get a minimum batch of 100 pins of one design. However, with your support even full set of four different Emotional Support Pins might go into production. The more choice for you and more pins for everyone! Please see the Stretch Goal descriptions below for the details.</p>
<p>If you can’t back my project, but still want to support the idea, please share and help me spread the word about Emotional Support Pins. Sharing is caring!</p>
<p>You can follow me on Instagram (<a href=""https://instagram.com/accordingtoalisa"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>@accordingtoalisa</strong></a>)</p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Enjoy!</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Let's get down to business...</h2>
<p>Due to the minimum order limit from manufacturer, it is a fixed goal campaign.<br/>If the initial goal of $600 will be reached, your funding will allow me to order 100 pieces of soft enamel pins of proper quality from European manufacturer and ship those to you once ready.  However, do not let this threshold stop you from backing. I have a range of stretch goals planned for you. With every unlocked stretch goal the batch of relevant design (100 pieces) will be manufactured.</p>
<p><strong>Technical specs for all designs:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>size: 30 mm/ ~1.2 inch at the widest point</li>
<li>soft-enamel pin</li>
<li>black dye plating</li>
<li>black rubber clutch</li>
</ul>
<p>Soft enamel will allow for vibrant colors and sharper lines with nice embossed look. I believe live freehand lines give these pins extra hearty handcrafted feeling.</p>
<p><strong>Planned time frame:</strong></p>
<p>June: Indiegogo campaign to raise the funds<br/>July-August: manufacturing, delivery to me and quality check upon arrival.<br/>August: shipping the perks to backers.</p>
<h2>Pins and goals</h2>
<p><strong>***Mid-campaign update: now initial goal includes 2 pin designs instead of one! ***</strong></p>
<p>The initial goal includes production of two pins ""Unicorns and rainbows"" pin and ""Sky's the limit"" pin. Every next stretch goal will add one more design to the selection. </p>
<h3>Initial goal ($600): Unicorns and rainbows</h3>
<p>Mock-up and specifications:</p>

<p>The ultimate spirit lifter. If anyone tells you that life is not supposed to be all “unicorns and rainbows”, this pin will always remind you that it actually is.</p>
<p>Designed with affection towards all people out there striving to stay positive! You keep us all going, and this pin will help you do that.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Initial goal ($600): Sky’s the limit</h3>

<p>In desperate need of motivation to achieve something? Oh, come on, it is 21st century, even the sky is not the limit any more! This astronaut will lead your way to great beyond. Beyond your wildest dreams and challenges, that life might throw at you. He will help you to reach the highest goal you set for yourself.</p>

<p><i>This seems like a big ask, but if we reach this goal, all backers that have already selected a perk will receive Plushie pin as a gift.</i></p>
<p>I have a soft spot for this one and I would love to see this pin come to life. This fluff is a “spirit animal” that is here to carry all your emotional burden for you so you do not have to.</p>

<ol>
<li>Please note, that images where pins are shown on outfits, are digital visualisation, not actual pins. We do not have any pins produced at the moment, but images are here to help you imagine planned real-life size. Actual color may slightly vary. </li>
<li>This is a fixed goal campaign, meaning, if we do not reach initial goal amount of $600, designs will not go into production and all backers will be refunded.</li>
<li>Choosing perks, keep in mind that only ""Unicorn"" and ""Sky's the limit"" (aka Astronaut) designs are included into initial goal. Meaning, if you select 3-pin perk, but eventually only Unicorn and Astronaut designs will be funded, you will have to select from these two designs only. The more Stretch Goals will be reached, the more designs will be unlocked and available for selection. I’ll poll all backers in the end of campaign for selection.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you still have any question about my stretch goals or anything else, feel free to ask in comments.</p>
<p>All in all, I try to reduce the risk as much as possible, still, as with every campaign, some unexpected issues might appear. I will keep my backers updated on every step of the project.</p>

<p>In order to finance Mariella's first batch of Jewellery for wholesale in the UK, we require:</p>

What We Need & What You Get
If we don't reach our target?
What do you get? - The Perks!
What is Nascence?
Nascence is a project designed to help emerging fashion designers from outside of the UK develop a network of stockist and customers in the UK and the Republic of Ireland.  
Why Do We Want To Start This Project?
It is nearly impossible for the designers from some parts of the globe to do it themselves.  We are a team of two fashion lovers who have spent our early careers working in the fashion industry as a Fashion Wholesaler and Fashion PR Consultant where we have been surprised and disappointed to recognise how many talented designers don't get the opportunity to produce and share their collections with us in the UK due entirely to logistical or financial limitations.  As a Team, we are ideally placed in terms of spotting real talent and then generating sales for the emerging talents that we find around the globe.  We believe that with your help, we can facilitate the growth of talented designers from around the world by giving them access to the vibrant UK market which is reknown for it's appetite for original and creative fashion collections.  
We have seen a problem and we have the skills to do something about it with your help.  The first designer we have identified as a great prospect is Mariella Pilato.


         

    
        

If you like fashion, you will LOVE the first collection we want to finance produced by Mariella Pilato, a Jewellery designer based in Bali, Indonesia (Where is Bali?).  Plus, you will enjoy the perks even more!
Your support spreading the message and contributing financially to the campaign will mean that Mariella will be able to turn a dream into a reality by having her creations enjoyed by fashion lovers and many more in the most vibrant market for fashion in Europe, the UK.

Your support will be rewarded and remembered with some fantastic perks and the eternal gratitude of the Team at Nascence and Mariella.

How Can You Help?
 The Team at Nascence believe that crowdfunding is the perfect way to raise funds for our project because we hope that many of our contributors will also be fashion lovers who want to wear Mariella's current and future Collections. We want to interact with our supporters (Facebook,Twitter and Instagram), listen to feedback about the Collections of our Designers and encourage you to introduce your friends and family to the fantastic collections that you played a part in supporting.  With your financial and moral support, we want Nascence, and you our supporters, to be the perfect UK partners for talented, emerging designers by providing the business infrastructure, supporters network and finance to produce and distribute their first Collections to hit the UK in a big way.  For many of the designers we want to work with, it is simply a lack of business know-how and resources that prevents them from taking their collections from one-off orders to being stocked in boutiques up and down the UK.   

Where Will The Money Go?
All money raised through this campaign will be used for the production, shipment and then sale of the first batch of products from Mariella Pilato in the UK.  Nascence will then use it's wholesale network to have the Collection regularly stocked in shops around the UK creating a lasting network for the distribution of Mariella's current and future collections.  
In order to finance Mariella's first batch of Jewellery for wholesale in the UK, we require:
£8000 - Production of a bulk amount of Mariella's Collection, 'Patterns of Crystallization'.  A significant order like this will enable Mariella to dedicate her time to her fashion label and the collection full-time which is important for future growth of the label because every piece is handmade.  With the sales push by Nascence, we will be able to provide a steady stream of future orders allowing the label to grow and become self-sufficient.
£2000 - Shipping and insurance from Mariella's workshop in Bali to Nascence's base in London.  The inhibitive cost of shipping and insurance from Bali is one of the main hurdles that have prevented Mariella from establishing a firm presence in the UK previously.
£5000 - For a three month Marketing and Sales push to fashion outlets across the UK and Republic of Ireland after which we hope to generate second orders for Mariella's collection from at least 10 different outlets.

If we don't reach our target?

If we do not reach our £10000 target, we will use the money we do raise to manufacture a smaller batch of Jewellery.  We will also continue to try and raise funds from friends and family to hit our £10000 target.

</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So far, we've raised the majority of our initial budget ... investing these monetary resources into supplies, advertising, shipping/freight, and airfare.  To fully achieve our goal, all that remains are a few travel expenses and a bit of financial compensation for our design team who will be presenting our fashions on the runway.  I believe that $900 is a realistic goal and I know that we will be able to reach that goal with your help.  Expenses that we are planning for include:</p>
<p>- accomodations for our crew<br/>- travel expenses to and from the venue<br/>- food &amp; beverage for the crew <br/>- shipping our our entire clothing line to and from the event</p>
<p>Every little bit helps and every dollar will go toward the completion of this project ... even if means that we are unable to fully realize our goal and have fewer people participating in this great opportunity.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><span>Second Star Designs has been selected as the only children's clothing designer to participate in an international fashion runway event. This eco-oriented, small business will showcase 15 of their top designs for the 2012/2013 season alongside dozens of other, incredibly talented fashion designers.</span></p>
<p><span>Baltimore FashionWeek is among the first major runway events in the United States to have opened the catwalk to children's clothing designers.  Not since 2010 has a children's clothing designer graced the fashion runway; of all artisans who applied to participate in this event, Caryn Stockwell, of Second Star Designs in Vancouver, WA, was the only children's clothing designer chosen by the designer selection process. She will be opening for Baltimore FashionWeek with the debut of her 2012/2103 collection on Saturday, August 18, 2012, at the Pikesville Hilton in Baltimore County, MD.</span></p>
<p><span>The potential of this endeavor is great - allowing for other venues around the world to follow in the steps forged by Baltimore FashionWeek and Second Star Designs.  Through the utilization of recycled and organic materials, the designs being presented on the runway will help to expand the possibilities of fashion designers around the world.</span></p>

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>Your contribution will not only make it possible for me to accept the invitation to showcase my work in an international marketplace, Vancouver BC Fashion Week, but will also help me to continue to reach my goals and take my designs to the next level.</div>
<div>It was only in Paris, April 2013, that I realized my true desire and made a commitment to myself.  A promise to be true to me, go after what I wanted in my life, and most importantly, fearlessly make my art.  Since then the Universe has responded, and reciprocated with a bounty of opportunity, all of which I have given myself to full force.  I hope to continue to reach these new heights and continue to grow and share my passion with the world as the opportunity arises....this time I'm just going to have to achieve it a bit more creatively and ask for a little help from my family and friends.</div>
<div>Until now the goals I have set and the opportunities that have arisen I have been able to achieve largely on my own.  I am not a person that easily asks for help.  So in some ways asking you now for your help to achieve this next goal, is also helping me to overcome another obstacle and achieve a personal level of growth, that it is ok to ask for help sometimes.</div>
<div>If you know me than you know that I go forward with complete dedication, and 100% concern for the quality of the outcome.  I promise that this endeavor will be no different. I am grateful for your support, love, encouragement, and mostly for the belief in me to go after my dreams full force!</div>

  The Impact
Your contribution will not only make it possible for me to accept the invitation to showcase my work in an international marketplace, Vancouver BC Fashion Week, but will also help me to continue to reach my goals and take my designs to the next level.
It was only in Paris, April 2013, that I realized my true desire and made a commitment to myself.  A promise to be true to me, go after what I wanted in my life, and most importantly, fearlessly make my art.  Since then the Universe has responded, and reciprocated with a bounty of opportunity, all of which I have given myself to full force.  I hope to continue to reach these new heights and continue to grow and share my passion with the world as the opportunity arises....this time I'm just going to have to achieve it a bit more creatively and ask for a little help from my family and friends.
Until now the goals I have set and the opportunities that have arisen I have been able to achieve largely on my own.  I am not a person that easily asks for help.  So in some ways asking you now for your help to achieve this next goal, is also helping me to overcome another obstacle and achieve a personal level of growth, that it is ok to ask for help sometimes.
If you know me than you know that I go forward with complete dedication, and 100% concern for the quality of the outcome.  I promise that this endeavor will be no different. I am grateful for your support, love, encouragement, and mostly for the belief in me to go after my dreams full force!

<p>We started our design process with the goal of a good looking wood and stainless steel hybrid watch. We completed our first round of prototypes but after putting them on, we knew we had a long way to go. They looked great but they didn't fit our reputation of offering lightweight and comfortable watches.</p>
<p>We spent over a year researching and testing ways to keep the watches lightweight and comfortable while using stronger and more durable materials like stainless steel, sapphire, and Swiss movements. Three designs and countless samples later, we nailed it.</p>

10ATM or 100 Meter Water Resistance Rating
The watches are rated at 10ATM or 100M water resistance so you'll never have to worry about water damage. 



We started our design process with the goal of a good looking wood and stainless steel hybrid watch. We completed our first round of prototypes but after putting them on, we knew we had a long way to go. They looked great but they didn't fit our reputation of offering lightweight and comfortable watches.
We spent over a year researching and testing ways to keep the watches lightweight and comfortable while using stronger and more durable materials like stainless steel, sapphire, and Swiss movements. Three designs and countless samples later, we nailed it.
Our ergonomic case back rises at a 30-degree angle to match the natural concave of your wrist

25% More Mobility Than Traditional Watches

Traditional flat cases restrict your wrists natural movements. Our ergonomic case design rises from the movement at a  30-degree angle which matches the natural concave of your wrist. This provides your wrist with a comfortable 100% range of motion.

<p>DTMS is a Brooklyn artist who has lived in New York City's toughest projects and perfers to remain anonymous, due to wanting his art to be the focus of the company, not himself. The artist is interested in having his artwork put on shirts and sweatshirts, thus we are starting a clothing company called ""Dirty Gold Clothing Company."" His work is expressionism in its raw form. The art pieces are metaphors for social issues affecting New Yorkers as well as people worldwide. The exact meaning of the art piece is never truly revealed, but it is left open for interpretation. The piece has a name that goes with it that would give more insight to the meaning of the work.</p>
<p>The artist uses his works to express the strength of common people and gives them power in powerless circumstances, and other pieces are simply expression of a certain mood. Each piece is rather abstract and simple. Much of the influence is a mix of mythology and realism. The art is raw, and at times vulger, but always meaningful and purposeful. The art represents the power of connections between people who struggle and how the street-level bond that people have often moves mountiains in a more abstract mind-state. </p>
<p>The are pieces are limited. There are many works that will be printed, but only a few of each piece, to maintain the integrity of the designs as true art pieces. Only 15 of each will be sold. The shirts/hoodies/crew neck sweatshirts and hats will be of the highest quality and will be numbered 1 of 15 etc, so the person who is purchasing will be know which number of 15 they own. The purpose of Dirty Gold is to produce high quality art and high quality clothing that is relevent and current to today's social issues. There will be Special Edition pieces for Martin Luther King Jr. day, Valentine's day etc. </p>
<p>We hope to eventually open a store-front in Brooklyn when Dirty Gold becomes a successful Brand. </p>

</div><p><b>Revolutionize the way you care about your pups and bring you peace of mind.</b></p><div>
</div><p>Dogs are known to be human’s best friend and we all love our pups. Truth be told, we often see them as our kids and are constantly wondering if there’s anything more we can do to learn more about their wellbeing and keep them as healthy and happy as possible.  </p><div>
</div><p>As human, we need our UP or Fitbit to track our activity and understand ourselves better, and for our beloved pups, we also need something to help us keep tabs on their behavior, activity level and whereabout. We care about their welfare the way we care about our own and would love to share that same love and care for our pups with other dog lovers as well.</p><div>
</div><p>What if there’s something that allows us to do things like that? </p><div>
</div><p>With a CTO who dedicated his free time fighting for animal rights and volunteering at an animal shelter, our  team really took the development of <b>Lucky Tag</b> to heart.</p><div>
</div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1154810/files/20150116211408-Intro_banner.jpg?1421471648"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div>

</div><p><b>Lucky Tag</b> is a colorful, cute, <i><b>on-collar tracker</b></i> that gives you detailed insights into your pup’s <b>activity level, behavior pattern and trends over time</b>. It also recognizes the <b><i>temperature</i></b> your pup is in, locates his or her <i><b>whereabouts</b></i>, and encourages <b><i>interaction with other loving dog owners</i></b> like you.</p><div>
</div><p>With it, you can obtain in-depth insights into your pup’s life whether you are around or not and be notified when further actions are needed. You can check in on your beloved pups whenever, wherever.</p><div>
</div><p>Besides taking care of your best friend in a healthier way, <b>Lucky Tag</b> also allows you to locate your pup with the help of others.</p><div>
</div><p>Dog lovers who own the <b>Lucky Tag</b> app on their smartphones can now help you find your beloved pup by messaging and guiding you to him or her. You can also use the app to exchange contacts and engage conversations with other dog owners and start building new friendships. </p><div>
</div><p><b>Lucky Tag</b> is all about your pup and knowing what’s going on with him or her. </p><p><br/></p><div>

<h3><b>SENSING AMBIENT TEMPERATURE</b></h3>
<p>With the <b>Lucky Tag</b> device and app, you can understand your pup’s health by tracking his or her activity level that is correlated with the surrounding temperature. When the ambient temperature is high and the activity level of your pup seems low, you know he or she might be feeling drowsy and it’s time to give him or her some water and go take a walk. </p>

<h3><b>FINDING NEARBY VET</b></h3>
<p>The <b>Lucky Tag </b>device and app took the activity monitoring feature to the next level with the “Finding Nearby Vet” feature. With it,, you can get a better sense of when your pup is most active, active or inactive. </p>
<p>When irregularity occurs, a warning message will pop up on your phone and “Nearby Vet” is just one click away. No more googling or yelping. </p>
<p>Moreover, share the information collected with your vet to make better healthcare decisions for your pup and take necessary actions.</p>

<h3><b>FIND MY DOG VIA COMMUNITY</b></h3>
<p>According to National Humane Society and the National Council of Pet Population Study and Policy, over 10 million pets get lost or stolen in the U.S. every year and only one-tenth of them get found and reunite with their owners.</p>
<p>As dog lovers ourselves, we were saddened by this heartbreaking statistics and have decided to take on a more proactive approach to help prevent missing dogs from happening. We know that nerve-wracking and heart-broken feeling you have when your pup wanders off and you have no idea where to find him or her. <b>Lucky Tag </b>now comes to the rescue. </p>
<p>When searching for your pup with <b>Lucky Tag</b>, you are not the only one searching for it, it’s a search party for everyone who has the device. Once you send out a notification to the <b>Lucky Tag </b>community, with collaborative effort, all <b>Lucky Tag</b> app owners within the network get notified and work together to help you locate your pup. The more, the merrier.</p>
<p>Be a good Samaritan and help each other out.</p>

<h3><b>INTERACT WITH OTHER PUP OWNERS</b></h3>
<p>We are trying to build a big community for the <b>Lucky Tag</b> family. Every member has his or her profile with their beloved pup. Within the community, you get to exchange information and interact with others like you. </p>
<p>Or, you can even help search for their lost pups. Who knows, this might just be the start of a new friendship.</p>

<p>The core of <b>Lucky Tag</b> is beacon technology. Every <b>Lucky Tag</b> has an unique ID that is configured for each dog and constantly sends out Bluetooth signals as far as 250 feet for smart phones nearby to detect and identify the ID. </p>
<p><b>Lucky Tag</b> tracks and logs your pup’s activity level as well as ambient temperature uninterruptedly while syncing the data with your smart phone, which can last up to 10 days.</p>
<p>With the ""Find My Dog"" feature of <b>Lucky Tag</b>, it helps you locate your missing pup with the collaborative effort of <b>Lucky Tag </b>devices near by.  By taking advantages of the multiplied distance of all <b>Lucky Tag</b> devices, the search range is potentially limitless.</p>

<p>What makes the <b>Lucky Tag</b> even cooler is the social feature of the Lucky Tag app. You can also use it to pinpoint close-by <b>Lucky Tag </b>owners and exchange contacts with one another. If there’s an user within 150 feet and the bluetooth is on on both sides, you can send him or her a message even without 3G or WiFi.</p>

<p>Prior to <b>Lucky Tag</b>, we’ve already had experiences in developing beacon-technology-powered products for different fields. Yet, as dog lovers ourselves, we are eager to bring this technology to our best friend and make a difference to the way we take care of them.</p>
<p>Now, we need your support to spread the words, invite friends and family to join our community so that we can take it to the next level and make it available for all dog lovers like you.</p>
<p>With your support, we can:</p>
<ul>
<li>promote responsible dog caring</li>
<li>help you monitor your pup’s activities, notify you when something is up and take proactive measures to care for him or her</li>
<li>continue to dedicate our effort and time in perfecting the <b>Lucky Tag</b> as well as developing a new platform that benefits other kind of pets </li>
<li>build and expand the <b>Lucky Tag</b> community to help search for lost pups and reunite them with worried owners  </li>
<li>provide you early access to our IndieGoGo specials with attractive and affordable pricing</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to <b>the Lucky Tag app </b>and what’s mentioned above, we are also planning on offering a <b>Lucky Tag hub</b> to help you receive real-time activity updates on your pup, store the data and automatically sync it to the cloud so that you can access any time anywhere in the near future.</p>
<p>It is in our heart to promote fun yet responsible dog caring and improving the lives of our beloved pups the way they bring joy to us.</p>

<p><b>Lucky Tag</b> started with a group of pet lovers from both technical and creative background hoping to create something that is beneficial to their pups. With wearables being the talk of the market and our expertise in beacon technology, it hit us, “why not do what we do best and create an useful wearable for our pups?”</p>
<p>After months of testing and refining the concept, we narrowed it down to 3 major features: Dog’s Health Tracker, Find My Dog and Social Interaction Between Dog Owners.</p>
<p>Yet, the best part is: </p>
<p>This idea just got patented and we are now brining it to everyone with an affordable and competitive price so that we can all have peace of mind when it comes to our fluffy friend.</p>
<p>That’s why we designed Lucky Tag.</p>

<h3><b>Design</b></h3>
<p>Lucky Tag consists of a core unit and a strap. It is super adorable and comes in 8 fun colors. </p>

<p>Not only is it cute and eye-catching but also very light and sturdy with a rugged, waterproof casing.</p>
<p>As amazing as it sounds, there also lies the most important question of all- Is it safe?</p>
<p>To address that issue, we adopted the FDA-certified non-allergic, soft silicone. It is completely safe, non toxic and can be easily and securely attached to any collar to avoid being bitten off or broken by pups themselves. </p>
<p>Oh and, YES, Lucky Tag does come in small sizes for smaller dogs as well.</p>

<br/>
<h3><b>Technology</b></h3>
<p>Because we care about our pups as much as we care about ourselves, we have decided to use the best sensor chips we could find, along with temperature sensor and G sensor to automatically collect and record the data detected onto our Mobile Beacons. </p>

<p>On top of that, we also managed to provide wide RF search range without consuming much power.  Unlike those GPS-centric devices which consumes lots of power, we designed Lucky Tag in a way that you don't need to change it for at least another 4 to 6 months and we use the most common CR2032 battery which does not require weekly charging. In English, it saves lots of power and that's the beauty of applying beacon technology!  </p>

</ul></div>","Revolutionize the way you care about your pups and bring you peace of mind.
Dogs are known to be human’s best friend and we all love our pups. Truth be told, we often see them as our kids and are constantly wondering if there’s anything more we can do to learn more about their wellbeing and keep them as healthy and happy as possible.  
As human, we need our UP or Fitbit to track our activity and understand ourselves better, and for our beloved pups, we also need something to help us keep tabs on their behavior, activity level and whereabout. We care about their welfare the way we care about our own and would love to share that same love and care for our pups with other dog lovers as well.
What if there’s something that allows us to do things like that? 
With a CTO who dedicated his free time fighting for animal rights and volunteering at an animal shelter, our  team really took the development of Lucky Tag to heart.

A Holistic Approach To Take Care Of Your Best Friend

Lucky Tag is a colorful, cute, on-collar tracker that gives you detailed insights into your pup’s activity level, behavior pattern and trends over time. It also recognizes the temperature your pup is in, locates his or her whereabouts, and encourages interaction with other loving dog owners like you.
With it, you can obtain in-depth insights into your pup’s life whether you are around or not and be notified when further actions are needed. You can check in on your beloved pups whenever, wherever.
Besides taking care of your best friend in a healthier way, Lucky Tag also allows you to locate your pup with the help of others.
Dog lovers who own the Lucky Tag app on their smartphones can now help you find your beloved pup by messaging and guiding you to him or her. You can also use the app to exchange contacts and engage conversations with other dog owners and start building new friendships. 
Lucky Tag is all about your pup and knowing what’s going on with him or her. 

Lucky Tag does more than just tracking and monitoring your pup’s activity, it also embodies a collaborative searching feature that helps you find your lost pup and engage with other dog owners.

What can LUCKY tag do?

TRACKING ACTIVITY, INACTIVITY & HEALTH Lucky Tag tracks the daily walking, running activity and inactive rest periods of your pup. Our supported app presents you with an eye-catching visual snapshot of your pup’s activity highlighting the data and details that matter. 
How has he or she been feeling? Has she walked, run, played, or rested over the course of a day? How have things been trending over a certain period of time?




SENSING AMBIENT TEMPERATURE
With the Lucky Tag device and app, you can understand your pup’s health by tracking his or her activity level that is correlated with the surrounding temperature. When the ambient temperature is high and the activity level of your pup seems low, you know he or she might be feeling drowsy and it’s time to give him or her some water and go take a walk. 


FINDING NEARBY VET
The Lucky Tag device and app took the activity monitoring feature to the next level with the “Finding Nearby Vet” feature. With it,, you can get a better sense of when your pup is most active, active or inactive. 
When irregularity occurs, a warning message will pop up on your phone and “Nearby Vet” is just one click away. No more googling or yelping. 
Moreover, share the information collected with your vet to make better healthcare decisions for your pup and take necessary actions.

FIND MY DOG VIA COMMUNITY
According to National Humane Society and the National Council of Pet Population Study and Policy, over 10 million pets get lost or stolen in the U.S. every year and only one-tenth of them get found and reunite with their owners.
As dog lovers ourselves, we were saddened by this heartbreaking statistics and have decided to take on a more proactive approach to help prevent missing dogs from happening. We know that nerve-wracking and heart-broken feeling you have when your pup wanders off and you have no idea where to find him or her. Lucky Tag now comes to the rescue. 
When searching for your pup with Lucky Tag, you are not the only one searching for it, it’s a search party for everyone who has the device. Once you send out a notification to the Lucky Tag community, with collaborative effort, all Lucky Tag app owners within the network get notified and work together to help you locate your pup. The more, the merrier.
Be a good Samaritan and help each other out.

INTERACT WITH OTHER PUP OWNERS
We are trying to build a big community for the Lucky Tag family. Every member has his or her profile with their beloved pup. Within the community, you get to exchange information and interact with others like you. 
Or, you can even help search for their lost pups. Who knows, this might just be the start of a new friendship.

STAY CONNECTED WITH THE LUCKY TAG APP
Want to know how your pup is doing throughout the day? 
Stay connected with our supported app and receive updates and data on his or her activity status.
Whether you are occupied at work, away on vacation or just running some errands and gone for the day, you can check in on your pup via the app any time, anywhere.



LET LUCKY-HUB KEEP AN EYE OUT WHILE YOU'RE GONE.

Most of the time we aren’t at home, and it would be great if we can still keep an eye out for our pups. Lucky Hub solves this issue, and will keep you notified wherever you go.


With just a no-hassle-no-fuss setup, the Lucky Hub can notify you if you aren’t home for a period of time, it can still keep you informed on how your dog is doing at that moment, and also tell you if he isn’t performing too well and may need to seek attention.





DID WE MENTION THE APP IS SUPER CUTE AND USER FRIENDLY AS WELL? 



HOW IS LUCKY TAG DIFFERENT


The core of Lucky Tag is beacon technology. Every Lucky Tag has an unique ID that is configured for each dog and constantly sends out Bluetooth signals as far as 250 feet for smart phones nearby to detect and identify the ID. 
Lucky Tag tracks and logs your pup’s activity level as well as ambient temperature uninterruptedly while syncing the data with your smart phone, which can last up to 10 days.
With the ""Find My Dog"" feature of Lucky Tag, it helps you locate your missing pup with the collaborative effort of Lucky Tag devices near by.  By taking advantages of the multiplied distance of all Lucky Tag devices, the search range is potentially limitless.

What makes the Lucky Tag even cooler is the social feature of the Lucky Tag app. You can also use it to pinpoint close-by Lucky Tag owners and exchange contacts with one another. If there’s an user within 150 feet and the bluetooth is on on both sides, you can send him or her a message even without 3G or WiFi.




Prior to Lucky Tag, we’ve already had experiences in developing beacon-technology-powered products for different fields. Yet, as dog lovers ourselves, we are eager to bring this technology to our best friend and make a difference to the way we take care of them.
Now, we need your support to spread the words, invite friends and family to join our community so that we can take it to the next level and make it available for all dog lovers like you.
With your support, we can:

promote responsible dog caring
help you monitor your pup’s activities, notify you when something is up and take proactive measures to care for him or her
continue to dedicate our effort and time in perfecting the Lucky Tag as well as developing a new platform that benefits other kind of pets

<p>The process in actually pretty complicated, but we will break it
down into the basics: 1. Blocks of rosewood are milled out of our own designs
on our CNC machine. Once the process of milling is done the real work begins.
2. We hand sand down all of the fames and temples so to get out all of the
small imperfections. 3. We then apply a sealer and a finish. 4. The glasses are
then taken to a separate room to dry and be fully assembled with lenses and
spring-loaded hinges. </p>

</div></div>","Who We Are And What We Do! 


Drevo Optics was born out of a desire for a father and son to come together on a joint venture. With over 40 years of specialty wood experience, we know wood.  We know which is the strongest, the most flexible and which species can knock you out with stunning colors and grain textures. We saw a need in the wood sunglasses market for true craftsmen, and that is where Drevo comes in.
We are so excited to be launching this venture and joining the community of skilled craftsmen and women creating exceptional wares for all to enjoy. Come back often as we hope to be growing quickly and releasing new styles and frames.
We are launching our campaign with flexible funding to help us get all the help we can for our mill. Don't worry though, whatever you order, you will get by January.  





How Our Wooden Sunglasses Are Made

The process in actually pretty complicated, but we will break it
down into the basics: 1. Blocks of rosewood are milled out of our own designs
on our CNC machine. Once the process of milling is done the real work begins.
2. We hand sand down all of the fames and temples so to get out all of the
small imperfections. 3. We then apply a sealer and a finish. 4. The glasses are
then taken to a separate room to dry and be fully assembled with lenses and
spring-loaded hinges. 




Our Current Models

As of right now we are only offering a limited production of the
above model: The Frame is milled from Rosewood with Polycarbonate Bronze
Mirrored Lenses made by Carl Ziess. As these become more popular we will start
offering the bottom frames in limited production as well.

What We Need & What You Get

Our goal is to reach $17,000. As of right now we mill every pair of glasses out of a retro-fitted 1985 CNC machine. We are looking to upgrade to a little more current model that will allow us to make more sunglasses for you guys. 
We are so grateful for your donations that we have set up a line of perks so you can get something in return for your generosity. We will have perks from a personal thank you letter from the company, to redeemable coupons, sunglasses, and sweatshirts.

<h3>The Inspiration</h3>
<p>Something Old is Something New is a wedding line of 9 wedding gowns and 5 bridesmaid dress. They will all be made using recycled and vintage materials, and they will have an alluring charm that can only be found when you bring so many unique components together into a beautiful work of art. </p>
<p>I have been making wedding bouquets and accessories for awhile now, and I love making beautiful things that make people smile. I believe it is time to expand my wedding line a further by creating the clothing to match the bouquets and accessories I already create. You can check out my style, sales, and my feedback on my <a href=""http://www.etsy.com/shop/artforahome"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">etsy shop</a>. </p>
<p>I am focusing on the wedding section of my shop because I love the fantasy concept and idea, but I make a ton of other items including jewelry, costumes, wigs, funny greeting cards, and home decor items. For this reason I am offering an option ith my perks to choose items from my shops or receive custom made grab bags of goodies tailered to your personality.</p>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>I am completely enamored with the idea of making wedding gowns and bridesmaid dresses out of recycled and vintage fabrics and slips. I have several slips and sketches ready to roll, and my sewing machine is all greased up, but I don't have a mannequin or dress form to be able to make these dresses really come to life. The best price on a dress form that I can find is $114, so I figure with tax and shipping I need about $150.</p>
<p>I absolutely love the idea of adding fabric flowers and recycled bits of chiffon and lace to make rustic and romantic dresses that create a fairytale feeling. I already have a whole bunch of vintage slips I will use for the base of these dresses, and  I figure for 9 gowns and 5 bridesmaid dresses I will need about $300 in fabric, clothing, thread, and vintage jewelry.  After the fees from kickstarter and amazon I figure $450 should be enough to get this project off the ground. </p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>I love perks and I would be open to any custom requests or ideas. So feel free to comment and I will respond ASAP. </p>
<p>My first perk, for $5, is a shout out on my all my social networking accounts.</p>
<p>For $10 you get a handwritten thank you note and a small toy or trinket I have found in my salvaging.</p>
<p>For $25 you receive the previous reward as well as a $25 igft certificate to my etsy shop or I can make you a custom grab bag filled with handmade items and salvaged items you will love.</p>
<p>For $50 you get the thank card, small trinket, grab bag or git certificate, and you get to choose the name of one of the dresses I will debut in this clothing line. I love this idea because it means your name will live on with the production of these dresses for years to come, and I will make sure to link to you in the listing as well as any other place the dress is displayed.</p>
<p>For $100 you will receive a a yummy and inspirational treat. You will receive the card, the trinket, the gift certificate or grab bag, you will get to name a dress, and I will send you a 6 homemade cupcakes in your flavor choice and an inspirational word art painting.</p>
<p>For $250 you will receive all of the above PLUS a custom made dress. It will be made o your specific measurements, colors, style, and desire. I will work with you one-on-one during the entire process. </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project will have a positive impact on the environment because it will cause less waste and more beauty. It is my intention to provide the sponsors with a feeling of joy and delight as I catalog my journey through this process. This will allow me to make beautiful items that make other people very happy. The recycled materials will allow me to sell the wedding gowns for less than most wedding gowns which will allow brides-to-be feel like princesses on their big day without going broke. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What I Will Do With the Funds</h3>
<p>I have so many ideas that I actually dream about it, and I have already recruited a bunch of my girlfriends to help me with a photo shoot when the Something Old is Something New line of clothing is complete. It is going to be a really beautiful photo shoot since I already have a bunch of bouquets and accessories that will perfectly match the  dresses. </p>
<p> If I do not reach my goal, I will still purchase the dressform and as much materials as I can, and I will make the fasion line slmaller as appropriate to the funding. I can start shipping rewards and release photos of the finished fashion line in the end of May. </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Remember if you can't contribute you can still help me out a ton by sharing this with friends, commenting with positive encouragement or your own inspiration and ideas, and spreading positive energy everyday. Even if that its only a small smile at a random stranger.</p>
<h3>Thank You</h3>
<p>Thank to everyone reading this for giving me the time to share my inspiration and joy with you! If you can't conribute, I completey understand; please share this campaign with your freinds and family!</p>

<h3><span>Where We've Been &amp; Where We Want To Go</span></h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Larry Peck and I am the president and founder of Demanding Products, Inc. in the Atlanta, GA area.  In 2005 I launched <a href=""http://www.YourNameUniversity.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.YourNameUniversity.com</a>, a unique web site that allows you to personalize apparel products with a university name of your own.  Since then, we have added several new design categories and now offer more than 90 products.  But the current image creation process is 100% manual and we are limited in the number of designs and color schemes we can offer.</p>
<p>In 2008, I came up with the idea to offer the same ""Your Name"" concept but with a much larger variety of designs.  No longer limited to just ""University"" or ""Property Of"" designs, we can allow our customers to personalize many different styles of designs based on a variety of businesses.  </p>
<p>YourNameGear.com will allow us to offer all of our customers:</p>
<p>1.  Better quality designs.</p>
<p>2.  More apparel product and color choices.</p>
<p>3.  New designs containing white ink.</p>
<p>4.  100% automation of design image creation.</p>
<p>5.  More choices of embroidered products (hats, fleece, scarves, etc.)</p>
<h3><img alt=""YourNameGear.com Sample Designs"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i48.tinypic.com/9syosg.png"" src="""" style=""font-size: 1.17em;"" title=""YourNameGear.com Sample Designs""/></h3>
<h3><strong>Our Cool New Printing Technology</strong></h3>
<p>YourNameGear.com will use state-of-the-art Kornit Digital Inkjet Garment Printers for all printed designs.  These amazing high-quality/high-volume printers will allow us to meet flexible demand schedules and keep our production costs down and pass the savings along to our customers.</p>
<p>To see a video on how this amazing technology works, <strong>click on the printer image below.</strong></p>

<p>We need to raise a minimum of $70,000 in funding to make YourNameGear.com happen.  The proceeds from this funding will enable us to completely upgrade our apparel design and printing functionality and improve our order fulfillment processes.  It will also allow us to implement a few new product ideas that we can't talk about publicly yet, but they are very cool and no one is doing it yet.</p>

<h3>You will be able to choose from <strong>ALL</strong> of the designs we have available at YourNameGear.com launch to print on <strong>YOUR</strong> perk.</h3>
<p>In addition, we will be offering a variety of special promotional discounts for campaign contributors for the first year after YourNameGear.com has launched.</p>
<h3>We Want To Hear Your Design Ideas!</h3>
<p>The number of designs we can create for YourNameGear.com are unlimited and we want to hear what you want to see on YourNameGear.com!   If you have an idea for a design you want us to offer, please leave it in the comments section and we will review it as soon as possible. </p>
<h3>The Impact Your Contribution Will Make</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>YourNameGear.com has been a dream of mine since 2008.  And while YourNameUniversity.com has been moderately successful, the financial crisis of 2007 set back our plans to develop the YourNameGear.com project.</p>
<p>The availability of sites like IndieGOGO.com and this crowdfunding campaign can make this dream come true in the next few months with your generous help.</p>
<h3>How We Will Use The Funds</h3>
<p>The web site design; back office processes; and image rendering processes have been completely spec'd out and reviewed.   As you can see by the image above we have plenty of designs in the works with more to come!</p>
<p>The proceeds from this campaign will be used to build out YourNameGear.com and all of the back office software and processes.  In addition, our award-winning creative director, Frank Loconsole, will work his magic on all of our designs before launch. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you don't have the money at this time to contribute to our YourNameGear.com campaign, we completely understand.  Times are tough for many people in our country.  </p>
<p>But we hope you will take a second to share our campaign on facebook, twitter, and via email.</p>
<h3>Site Launch</h3>
<p>We expect the site to launch at the beginning of May 2013.  After the site launches, each contributor will receive an email containing detailed instructions how to redeem their perk.</p>
<h3>Shipping Charges</h3>
<p>When you redeem your perk after YourNameGear.com launches, you will be charged shipping/handling based on the weight of your perk and the distance it is being shipped.  All perks will be shipped via USPS Priority Mail.</p>

YourNameGear.com will allow us to offer all of our customers:
1.  Better quality designs.
2.  More apparel product and color choices.
3.  New designs containing white ink.
4.  100% automation of design image creation.
5.  More choices of embroidered products (hats, fleece, scarves, etc.)

Our Cool New Printing Technology
YourNameGear.com will use state-of-the-art Kornit Digital Inkjet Garment Printers for all printed designs.  These amazing high-quality/high-volume printers will allow us to meet flexible demand schedules and keep our production costs down and pass the savings along to our customers.
To see a video on how this amazing technology works, click on the printer image below.

Look at the picture below to see how much better Digital Inkjet Printing holds up over time against typical silk-screen printing.

We only offer the highest quality apparel for our customers and are constantly looking for new gear to add to our product line-up.

What We Need & What You Get


We need to raise a minimum of $70,000 in funding to make YourNameGear.com happen.  The proceeds from this funding will enable us to completely upgrade our apparel design and printing functionality and improve our order fulfillment processes.  It will also allow us to implement a few new product ideas that we can't talk about publicly yet, but they are very cool and no one is doing it yet.
As our way of saying thank you for your contribution to the YourNameGear.com campaign, we are offering 8 unique perks for you to choose from.

In addition, we will be offering a variety of special promotional discounts for campaign contributors for the first year after YourNameGear.com has launched.
We Want To Hear Your Design Ideas!
The number of designs we can create for YourNameGear.com are unlimited and we want to hear what you want to see on YourNameGear.com!   If you have an idea for a design you want us to offer, please leave it in the comments section and we will review it as soon as possible. 
The Impact Your Contribution Will Make


YourNameGear.com has been a dream of mine since 2008.  And while YourNameUniversity.com has been moderately successful, the financial crisis of 2007 set back our plans to develop the YourNameGear.com project.
The availability of sites like IndieGOGO.com and this crowdfunding campaign can make this dream come true in the next few months with your generous help.
How We Will Use The Funds
The web site design; back office processes; and image rendering processes have been completely spec'd out and reviewed.   As you can see by the image above we have plenty of designs in the works with more to come!
The proceeds from this campaign will be used to build out YourNameGear.com and all of the back office software and processes.  In addition, our award-winning creative director, Frank Loconsole, will work his magic on all of our designs before launch. 


Other Ways You Can Help
If you don't have the money at this time to contribute to our YourNameGear.com campaign, we completely understand.  Times are tough for many people in our country.  
But we hope you will take a second to share our campaign on facebook, twitter, and via email.
Site Launch
We expect the site to launch at the beginning of May 2013.  After the site launches, each contributor will receive an email containing detailed instructions how to redeem their perk.
Shipping Charges
When you redeem your perk after YourNameGear.com launches, you will be charged shipping/handling based on the weight of your perk and the distance it is being shipped.  All perks will be shipped via USPS Priority Mail.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Recently, Patrick Hussey, former designer and co-founder of Spy Optics, joined our team. He is very passionate about our product. He is pumping out some awesome prototype designs for our upcoming collection and he is using a very interesting hybrid combination of polymers and alloys. He is also designing an ""Asian Fit"" in all our new styles.</p>
<p><strong>Competition</strong>: Our competition is Maui Jim. They are global, they are pretty much everywhere. Great sunglasses and the company does extremely well, basically in the hundreds of millions. With their styles and price points you mostly see the older generation wear them, which is good for us because we are picking up the younger minded market share. In fact, some people refer to us as the Oakley version of Maui Jim.</p>

<p></p>
<p>We were inspired by the Delta Robot, invented in the 1980s by Swiss Professor Reymond Clavel. Three individually operated arms move with incredible precision <span>controlling the robot's head.</span></p>
<p>LOCOOP Y is the first 3D printer to bring this <span>technology to mass market. </span></p>
<p>Cartesian and linear delta 3D printers need to keep constant tension on carrier rails. This causes friction that leads to faster wear and <span>tear on vital components. LOCOOP Y doesn't have carrier rails. Instead, its arms move in precise circular patterns, increasing reliability over the long-term.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1468572919/industry_inspired_technology_cvtpbx.png"" src="""" style=""background-color: initial;""/></p>

</div>
<div>
<p></p>
<p>The most common error that plagues 3D printers is layer shift. It happens as Cartesian and linear delta printers gradually lose tension on their carrier rails.</p>
<p>Based on our experience, layer shift is most likely to occur three-quarters of the way through a big print, when you're on a tight deadline.</p>
<p>By eliminating carrier rails on the LOCOOP Y, we've also eliminated layer shift.</p>

<p>Industrial machines are used thousands if not millions of times a day and stay reliable. We asked ourselves, ""Why can't 3D printers be the same?""</p>
<p>The three-<span>armed Delta Robot that inspired our Original Delta technology is used in industries where precision is mission critical, including packaging, high precision assembly, pharmaceuticals, and even in surgeries.</span></p>
<p>LOCOOP Y has a 50 micron printing resolution, <span>but more importantly, it maintains that level of precision over time. We've run prints up to 48 hours with no print errors.</span></p>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Large Door</b>: LOCOOP Y’s huge front facing door makes it easy to remove even the largest of prints.</li>
<li>
<b>Extra-Large Removable Bed</b>: The polycarbonate surface is specially textured to make sure prints adhere well, stay flat, and don't curl up at the edges. The bed also comes out easily so that you can remove objects without damaging them. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Memory Card Slot:</b> Transfer your designs easily to LOCOOP Y by using a memory card up to 4GB. That's four times the memory supported by most 3D printers.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Less Energy Consumption:</b> At just 60 Watts, LOCOOP Y uses half the energy of a conventional 3D Printer, making it super efficient and environment friendly. Think of what this would mean for a lab or school running multiple printers at the same time.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Open Source ""CURA"" Compatibility: </b>LOCOOP Y is compatible with the CURA interface that you already know and love. (It's the most popular open-source slicer available!) Nothing new to learn. Start exporting G-code immediately.</li>

</div></div>","The biggest problems with most desktop 3D printers are that after a couple of months, signs of wear and tear start to show. When this happens and the carrier rails and belts start losing tension, you have to manually adjust them in regular basis; or replace large parts of your printer.LOCOOP Y is the first 3D printer without carrier rails, which makes it extremely durable and reliable. It also means that you don't have to waste time maintaining the printer’s condition. This saves you on filament, spare parts and most importantly, time.

More Time for Making. Less Time Calibrating.When we started making LOCOOP Y our benchmark was the ink jet printer. Essentially a machine that anyone with some basic computer knowledge could set up and consistently get the results they expect. 


Auto Calibration
Auto Leveling






Beautifully Designed. Easy to Use.

3D printing with LOCOOP Y is easy and intuitive. Also, we've made sure that there's no filament hanging off the side. LOCOOP makes it easy to check the progress of your print with the door closed, and you can easily remove the print bed as necessary.


Embedded filament holder (rotating base)
Detachable print bed
Large, transparent door
Touch screen LCD panel & SD card slot






Assembles in a Snap.


Putting LOCOOP Y together couldn’t be easier. The top assembly comes as a single piece, so there are no small parts to fiddle with. The print head snaps into place in seconds thanks to magnetic joints.


Fully assembled top assembly
Case, door, bottom plate and the legs need assembly






Print Big. Hassle-free.

Size matters when it comes to prototyping and making cool things. LOCOOP Y can print up to 180mm x 200mm with precision, reliability, and no layer shift. Hit print when you leave the office, and it will be done by the morning. It also runs on half the energy consumption of a conventional 3D printer.With every printer we will include a 1 kg spool of filament and a 4GB SD card. 



Help us deliver LOCOOP Y to you!
We've got two working prototypes printing and testing non-stop right now, but we need your help to ramp up production and deliver LOCOOP Y to you. Your support in our Indiegogo campaign will help us commercialize the world's first 'original delta' 3D printer.











We were inspired by the Delta Robot, invented in the 1980s by Swiss Professor Reymond Clavel. Three individually operated arms move with incredible precision controlling the robot's head.
LOCOOP Y is the first 3D printer to bring this technology to mass market. 
Cartesian and linear delta 3D printers need to keep constant tension on carrier rails. This causes friction that leads to faster wear and tear on vital components. LOCOOP Y doesn't have carrier rails. Instead, its arms move in precise circular patterns, increasing reliability over the long-term.
 







The most common error that plagues 3D printers is layer shift. It happens as Cartesian and linear delta printers gradually lose tension on their carrier rails.
Based on our experience, layer shift is most likely to occur three-quarters of the way through a big print, when you're on a tight deadline.
By eliminating carrier rails on the LOCOOP Y, we've also eliminated layer shift.








Industrial machines are used thousands if not millions of times a day and stay reliable. We asked ourselves, ""Why can't 3D printers be the same?""
The three-armed Delta Robot that inspired our Original Delta technology is used in industries where precision is mission critical, including packaging, high precision assembly, pharmaceuticals, and even in surgeries.
LOCOOP Y has a 50 micron printing resolution, but more importantly, it maintains that level of precision over time. We've run prints up to 48 hours with no print errors.











Large Door: LOCOOP Y’s huge front facing door makes it easy to remove even the largest of prints.

Extra-Large Removable Bed: The polycarbonate surface is specially textured to make sure prints adhere well, stay flat, and don't curl up at the edges. The bed also comes out easily so that you can remove objects without damaging them. 


Memory Card Slot: Transfer your designs easily to LOCOOP Y by using a memory card up to 4GB. That's four times the memory supported by most 3D printers.


Less Energy Consumption: At just 60 Watts, LOCOOP Y uses half the energy of a conventional 3D Printer, making it super efficient and environment friendly. Think of what this would mean for a lab or school running multiple printers at the same time.


Open Source ""CURA"" Compatibility: LOCOOP Y is compatible with the CURA interface that you already know and love. (It's the most popular open-source slicer available!) Nothing new to learn. Start exporting G-code immediately.















Need extra filament? You can add extra rolls of the filament we use every day for our prints at LOCOOP. We've secured a very special price of just $25. (Only valid as an add-on when you order LOCOOP Y.)

<p></p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/830257/files/20140902205553-090214_1152_Proto_RDhomepage.png?1409716553"" src="""" style=""""/><p></p><div align=""center""><b>Q&amp;A for the Re-Invent Democracy Team</b></div>
<p></p><b>Question: What is your mission?</b>
<p></p>Our mission is to accelerate the evolution of democratic forms of government as they incorporate advanced information technology, telecommunications and social networks. 

<p></p>In particular, we plan to use our Re-Invent Democracy Web Technology to solve a public sector crisis that the public sector is unable to solve - the global governance crisis - by enabling voters across the political spectrum to build consensus and end conflicts that far too many governments are failing to resolve.

<p></p>This global governance crisis is jeopardizing progress on virtually every front. It stems from the failure of governing institutions and lawmakers to devise effective solutions to life-threatening crises and conflicts in a manner that serves the public interest and responds to their constituents' needs and demands.

<p></p>It also stems from the disconnect between lawmakers and their constituents, and the increasing tensions and confrontations occurring between them. Small numbers of lawmakers enact laws for millions of people who often encounter insurmountable obstacles when they try to use electoral and legislative processes to determine who is elected and what laws are passed.  

<p></p>Our goal is to ensure that governments and elected officials serve the people they represent. Right now, far too many governments around the world are disconnected from the people they should be representing because lawmakers put the demands of special interests ahead of the needs of their constituents. 

<p></p>The Re-Invent Democracy Web Technology enables people to take direct action to overcome this disconnect and replace failing governments with governments elected by and for the people. It empowers people from all walks of life to join forces to set common agendas and build winning voting blocs and coalitions that are large enough to decide who runs for office, who gets elected and what laws are passed. 

<p></p>The technology provides voters across the political and ideological spectrum access to a common website, reinventdemocracy.net, where they can meet online to build consensus about legislative priorities and solutions to any problem, crisis or conflict occurring at any level, within and across national boundaries. 

<p></p>All they will have to do to use the technology free of charge on this website is to create an account by providing a screen-name and a valid email address. Then they can set up their individual home page and obtain an internal email address so they can get started setting their agendas and connecting with like-minded voters with similar agendas.  

<p></p>Voters will be able to take the lead in consensus building, in concert, if they wish, with lawmakers, political parties, electoral candidates, issue groups, unions and civil society organizations of their choice. Together, they can form <i>transpartisan</i> online voting blocs and coalitions that cross partisan lines around <i>transpartisan</i> agendas for solving any problems, crises and conflicts they wish to address.
 
<p></p>By building consensus on the part of ever larger numbers of voters across the political and ideological spectrum, blocs and coalitions can create <i>transpartisan</i> electoral bases larger than the electoral base of any single political party. By so doing, blocs and coalitions can run and elect their own slates of candidates to enact their agendas. If they decide their elected representatives have failed to exert their best efforts to enact bloc and coalition agendas, they can run new slates of candidates to replace them in forthcoming elections.

<p></p>To fulfill this mission, we plan to build the world's first large scale consensus building and conflict resolution platform. Our social networking website, reinventdemocracy.net, will merge social media and politics to meet the unmet needs of the nearly three billion people who use social networks. 

<p></p>Surveys indicate a surge of worldwide discontent with elected officials and governments that are locked in political stalemates and conflicts and and put the demands of special interests ahead of the public interest. The platform will enable those who are losing faith in democratic electoral and legislative processes to reform and re-invent them by inserting new voter-controlled consensus-building structures into these processes that can work with lawmakers to devise workable solutions. 
 
<p></p>Our goal is empower voters to re-invent failing democracies by overcoming the disconnect between ordinary people around the world and their governments. Most people have little say in government decisions affecting their lives and well-being.

<p></p>Unfortunately, this disconnect is leading to government-caused stalemates, crises and conflicts, within and across national borders, which are making it increasingly difficult for people to obtain jobs that pay living wages and afford the basic necessities of life. These difficulties are largely due to the fact that elected representatives tend to put the laws demanded by special interests ahead of the needs of their constituents. This is most likely to occur when lawmakers depend on special interest money to get elected, which is the case with the large majority of U.S. lawmakers. 


<p></p>We think this technology will prove especially useful in countries like the U.S. where minority rule by special interests has paralyzed the federal government in Washington, D.C.

<p></p>Legislative gridlock in the U.S. Congress is largely caused by uncompromising partisan conflicts among special interests, political parties and party representatives, while the needs of ordinary people and the public interest are ignored.

<p></p>The unique Re-Invent Democracy technology can overcome these conflicts by enabling entire electorates to get control of elections and legislation. Voters can build consensus online around legislative agendas specifying what they want government to do, or not to do. They can email their priorities to their elected representatives and mandate them to enact their agendas or risk defeat in the next election. If they decide to vote against their elected representatives in the next election, they can build winning voting blocs and electoral coalitions to run and elect their own candidates.

<p></p>We are seeking $500,000 to fund the first stage of developing our technology into the world's first large scale consensus building and conflict resolution platform. We will use the funds to develop and test the user-friendliness of our implementation of the technology in three prototypes. They include two global democracy building and social networking websites, as well as an online multi-party game of electoral strategy that shows players how to use the technology. 

<p></p>Together, these offerings will provide voters the tools they need to get control of electoral and legislative processes.  They will be able to build winning online voting blocs and coalitions large enough to elect lawmakers without special interest funding to enact legislation that meets<i> their </i>needs rather than the demands of special interests.

<p></p><b>Question: What is the technology?</b>
<p></p>Answer: The technology includes the recently patented <a href=""http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=%22Interactive+Voter+Choice+System%22.TI.&amp;OS=TTL/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Interactive Voter Choice System</a> and the <a href=""http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=8313383.PN.&amp;OS=PN/8313383&amp;RS=PN/8313383"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">System for Playing an Interactive Voter Choice Game</a>. 

<p></p>We plan to make this technology available on the <a href=""http://www.reinventdemocracy.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">reinventdemocracy.net</a> website and the <a href=""http://www.reinventdemocracyfoundation.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">reinventdemocracyfoundation.net</a> website.

<p></p><b>Question: How does the technology work?</b>
<p></p>Answer: It enables voters to build voting blocs and electoral coalitions that comprise broad cross-sections of the electorate and can acquire more political influence than political parties. 

<p></p>These blocs and coalitions, which can comprise and align with political parties, can build electoral bases that surpass the voting strength of political parties and their ability to elect candidates of their choice.

<p></p>Here's how:
<ul>
<li>Voters can use the technology to set their legislative agendas, connect with voters with similar agendas and form online voting blocs and electoral coalitions with like-minded voters.</li>
<li>Bloc and coalition members can vote on common agendas and common slates of candidates.</li>
<li>They can reach out to voters across the political and ideological spectrum to negotiate common legislative agendas that cross partisan and ideological lines.
</li>
<li>Blocs and coalitions with <i>transpartisan</i> agendas can build<i> transpartisan</i> electoral bases with greater numbers of voting members than the electoral bases of any single political party.</li>
<li>Blocs and coalitions can use these electoral bases to elect their own slates of candidates, and hold their elected representatives accountable at the ballot box for enacting bloc and coalition agendas.
</li>
</ul><p></p>Our online multi-party game of electoral strategy shows players how to build winning voting blocs and coalitions.

<p></p>
<b>Question: How do these voting blocs and coalitions compare to political parties?</b>
<p></p>Answer: There are three major differences:
<ul>
<li>Bloc and coalition members can vote on bloc and coalition agendas and slates of candidates, in contrast to parties that do not permit their members to vote on their agendas and slates of candidates before they are on the ballot.</li>
<li>Bloc and coalition agendas do not have to conform to particular ideologies or party lines and can include voters across the political and ideological spectrum.
</li>
<li>Since blocs and coalitions can build larger <i>transpartisan</i> electoral bases than the electoral base of a single party, bloc and coalition candidates can defeat party candidates and win without special interest campaign contributions.
</li>
</ul><p></p>Parties and candidates typically limit voters' choices to voting for or against candidates already on the ballot who are running on agendas over which voters have little influence. 

<p></p>In contrast, blocs and coalitions that use our technology, acting independently or in alliance with political parties, can run their own slates of candidates on ballot lines of their choosing.

<p></p>Another difference is that political parties <i>divide</i> voters across partisan lines, while our technology <i>unites</i> voters across the political and ideological spectrum around <i>transpartisan </i>voting blocs, coalitions, agendas and electoral bases that cross partisan lines.

<p></p>
<b>Question: How does the technology promote consensus building?</b>
<p></p>In order to grow large enough to win elections, our technology motivates blocs and coalitions to continuously reach out to new voters to build consensus. They can use it to open dialogues with prospective new bloc and coalition members an to discuss, debate and vote on common agendas and slates of candidates.  This drive to increase bloc and coalition voting strength encourages continuous consensus building by ever larger numbers of voters working together to set common legislative agendas.

<p></p>Technically speaking, the technology's electronic data processing capabilities make it possible to connect voters, elected representatives, candidates, policy makers, and members of political parties, issue groups and non-governmental organizations online on a scale never before possible.  By discussing, debating and voting on agendas to resolve political problems, crises and conflicts, they can build large <i>multi-stakeholder</i>  voting blocs and electoral coalitions around common agendas and run and elect common slates of candidates.

<p></p>
<b>Question: What are the ultimate goals of the technology, websites and game?</b>
<p></p>Answer: The goals are to enable voters and democracy stakeholders around the world to replace minority rule by special interests with majority rule by injecting voter-controlled consensus building structures and processes into elections and legislative decision-making. 

<p></p>These structures and processes will enable them to put an end to the political stalemates and legislative gridlock caused by constant in-fighting among special interests, political parties and politicians. The reason they can do so is because they can grow <i>transpartisan</i> electoral bases large enough to defeat incumbents by running and electing their own candidates.

<p></p>Question: Could failing democracies be reformed through traditional legislative and legal channels instead of relying on technology?

<p></p>Answer: This is unlikely because democracies have fallen prey to deeply embedded obstructions in the form of campaign finance and election laws, etc. that prevent their electorates from deciding who runs for office, who gets elected, and what laws are passed. 

<p></p>The large majority of lawmakers who use these obstructions to get elected would be unlikely to pass laws to overturn them -- especially U.S. laws and court decisions like <i>Citizens United</i> that allow special interests to make virtually unlimited contributions to political campaigns. 

<p></p>
<b>Question: What is the impact of these obstructions?</b>
<p></p>Answer: 
<ul>
<li>Rigged elections.</li>
<li>Excessive partisanship on the part of uncompromising special interests, political parties and elected officials.</li>
<li>Legislative stalemates and gridlock caused by the refusal of lawmakers in opposing camps to resolve disagreements and conflicts in order to pass needed legislation.</li>
<li>Lawmakers' passage of laws that favor the interests of their special interest campaign contributors rather than those of their constituents.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<b>Question: Can the Re-Invent Demcocracy web technology be used to solve transnational conflicts?</b>
<p></p>Answer: Yes, the technology enables voters to build <i>transnational</i> voting blocs and coalitions to solve <i>transnational</i> problems, crises and conflicts.

<p></p>These <i>transnational</i>  blocs and coalitions can win elections in multiple countries by having their members create blocs, coalitions in their home country to elect lawmakers who pledge to enact the agendas of their <i>transnational</i> blocs and coalitions.

<p></p>Blocs and coalitions can also influence decisions by their executive branches of government when they grow large enough to determine the outcome of future elections.

<p></p>
<b>Question: Who is behind the Re-Invent Democracy web technology?</b>

<p></p>It comprises a ""computer based network"", a ""website on the Internet,"" and ""computerized databases of objects, each object representing a stance on a policy option of concern to voters."" The system, which creates ""aggregates of voters with similar preferred policy options"", is designed to enable voters to ""build consensus, coalitions and voting blocs that can run and elect their own candidates for office and induce elected representatives to enact their agendas.""

<p></p>The system is unique in terms of its potential to connect democracy building stakeholders across the political and ideological spectrum, including electorates, elected representatives, electoral candidates, political parties, issue groups and non-governmental organizations around the world. 

<p></p>For the first time in history, virtually unlimited numbers of individual stakeholders will be able to  connect to each other on a continuous basis; set their agendas, individually and collectively, across the board and partisan lines; and build <i>transpartisan </i>voting blocs, electoral coalitions and electoral bases that can elect lawmakers to enact their agendas.

<p></p>Moreover, the technology possesses an inherent incentive and unprecedented potential to <i>unite</i> voters rather than <i>divide</i> them as political parties do, because it will connect multiple groups of stakeholders who might otherwise be divided along partisan lines.  They will be united by their goal of ensuring majority rule by building <i>transpartisan</i> blocs and coalitions from the ""bottom up"" by sharing their ideas, knowledge and needs while negotiating and voting on the priorities to be included in common <i>transpartisan</i> agendas.  

<p></p>Thanks to this on-going consensus building process, the members of these blocs and coalitions will become more numerous and as well-informed as the small number of elected representatives and policy makers authorized to enact legislation and policies. When these officials receive mandates from blocs and coalitions, they will recognize that the mandates have been formulated by people who are as knowledgeable as they are, and possibly even more knowledgeable, because the mandates come from the grassroots and the people most affected by the legislation and policies in question. 

<p></p>People, groups and organizations can choose their priorities in several ways, including composing their own priorities specifying the legislation they want to see enacted, as well as by using customized databases that will be accessible online on the reinventdemocracy.net website. 

<p></p>Elected representatives, electoral candidates and political parties will also be able to use the technology to poll their constituents and supporters on a continuous basis to find out what their priorities are. 
They will be able to use the website to engage their supporters in discussing, debating and voting on their agendas.

<p></p>Representatives and candidates who succeed in generating widespread 
support for common legislative agendas that they set with their supporters 
will be able to forge winning electoral bases of voting constituents without special interest financing. Elected representatives who know what their constituents want, and honor their constituents' priorities rather than those of special interests, will be able to cast their votes in legislative bodies without conflicts of interest. 

<p></p>For example, if you are a member of any of these stakeholder groups, you can:
<ul>
<li>Set your own agenda of priorities regarding legislation you want lawmakers to enact.</li>
<li>Connect with people who have similar priorities in locations of your choice.</li>
<li>Join forces with like-minded democracy stakeholders to build voting blocs and electoral coalitions to discuss, debate and use the technology's <i>voting utility</i> to vote on common agendas, and pressure incumbent lawmakers to enact your agendas.</li>
<li>Nominate and elect your own candidates to replace lawmakers that your blocs and coalitions judge to have failed to exert their best efforts to enact the legislative mandates you have given them.</li>
</ul><p></p>There are four ways your blocs and coalitions will be able to use the reinventdemocracy.net website to pressure lawmakers into enacting your agendas and hold them accountable if they fail to do so. 

<p></p>You can:
<ul>
<li>Conduct large scale <i>petitioning campaigns</i>; use the <i>voting utility</i> to tally the number of signatories; transmit the petition to lawmakers electronically; and publicize the results via media of your choice.</li>
<li>Conduct <i>online referendums </i>that convey to your representatives your  immediate legislative priorities, using the <i>voting utility </i>to tally the number of votes cast to show them how many people advocate these priorities.</li>
<li>Conduct <i>online straw recall votes</i> to inform representatives and policy-makers who fail to exert their best efforts to enact your agendas and mandates how many people want to oust them from office immediately.</li>
<li>Defeat in <i>actual elections</i> lawmakers whose legislative track records are deemed unsatisfactory by your blocs and coalitions.

<b>THE RE-INVENT DEMOCRACY STORY<br/>by Nancy Bordier</b>
</div>
<p></p><b>A Rude Awakening</b>
<p></p>The story of the Re-invent Democracy web technology begins back in 2004 when I attended a campaign event for a U.S. presidential primary candidate. Six months earlier when the candidate first threw his hat into the ring, he advocated priorities similar to my own.

<p></p>But as soon as he started to raise campaign funds from special interests, he drifted farther and farther away from his original priorities towards those of the special interests. He lowered the priorities of early supporters and actual voters like myself down on his list of priorities in order to make room at the top for the priorities of his special interest contributors.

<p></p>But as soon as he started to raise campaign funds from special interests, he drifted farther and farther away from his original priorities towards those of the special interests. He lowered the priorities of early supporters and actual voters like myself down on his list of priorities in order to make room at the top for the priorities of his special interest contributors. 


<p></p>When the candidate teleconferenced into the campaign event I was attending and started hedging on his priorities without giving us a chance to articulate our own, I came to a sudden and unexpected realization. U.S. election campaigns have become meaningless rituals in which voters are led to believe they are calling the shots when they are in fact pawns in a special interest-dominated process over which they have virtually no control.

<p></p>The event was a disillusioning eye-opener for me. It motivated me to start paying closer attention to what was happening in Washington, D.C., where I observed a growing gap between voters' and lawmakers' priorities and the legislation enacted. The more I saw members of Congress vote against the priorities and needs of their constituents in favor of the priorities of their special interest campaign contributors, the more I came to doubt the U.S. has a fully functioning democracy at all.

<p></p>Ten years later, my observations have been confirmed by numerous researchers, academicians, and political analysts. They have shown that special interests (such as organized economic and business groups that do not have a vote) often decide what laws are passed while average citizens and groups representing large numbers of voters have little or no impact.

<p></p><b>Political Parties, Special Interests, and the Corruption of Democracy</b>
<p></p>Political parties are essential to democracy. The Re-Invent Democracy Web Technology enables voting blocs and coalitions to include and align with political parties of their choice, as well as to work independently of political parties. 

<p></p>However, voting blocs and coalitions that use this technology will be able to circumvent and counteract the negative influence that political parties and candidates backed by special interests have been injecting into electoral and legislative processes. 

<p></p>In the U.S., this negative influence derives from parties' and candidates' dependence on special interest money to win elections. Elections are no longer local because millions of dollars from external special interests flow into localities from outside to skew election results. They dwarf the contributions candidates received from people who actually reside in the district and have the right to vote.

<p></p>The resulting dependency relationship between candidates elected by external special interest money and the special interest contributors themselves requires that candidates who are elected accept special interest demands regarding the passage or rejection of specific legislation. 

<p></p>These dependency relationships also lead to the tendency of parties and their elected representatives to subordinate the public interest and needs of the American people to the priorities of their special interest backers.

<p></p>My view is that these relationships have fundamentally corrupted democracy in the U.S. and ushered in minority rule by special interests. I do not see any way to put an end to this corruption other than by the Re-Invent Democracy Web Technology because the passage of enough legislative reforms to permit majority rule appears extremely unlikely. (See my article <a href=""http://my.firedoglake.com/nancy-bordier/2013/02/04/un-corrupting-congress-a-system-changing-solution/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Un-Corrupting Congress: A System-Changing Solution</a>.)

<p></p>The reason I believe reforms are unlikely is because the obstructions of majority rule that the political parties and special interests have embedded in U.S. electoral and legislative processes at all levels of government are far too numerous and deeply rooted.

<p></p>For example, the two major U.S. political parties have spent decades at the state level passing laws to rig the outcomes of elections by changing the boundaries of election districts in virtually every state. The representatives of the major party controlling a state legislature have changed election district boundaries in the state to <i>include </i>voters likely to vote for their candidates and <i>exclude</i> voters likely to vote against them. 

<p></p>The electoral advantages the major parties have gained by changing boundaries are compounded by the unfair election laws they have also passed to prevent third parties from having a fair chance to run and elect candidates against major party candidates. As a result, the large majority of Congressional representatives live in ""safe"" districts that do not have competitive candidates on the ballot.

<p></p>And, to make matters worse, many states have adopted laws, rules, regulations and technologies designed to suppress the vote. They actually prevent people from voting and having their votes counted. 

<p></p>But that's not all. Parties and candidates who have rigged U.S. elections have also poisoned the waters of legislative processes in legislative bodies such as the U.S. Congress. They have done so in two distinct ways. One is by adopting such extreme, opposed stances that they can rarely agree to pass legislation. The other is to adopt rules and practices that allow a minority of members to block legislation supported by a majority of representatives. These Congressional minorities are also minorities of the population as a whole, enabling Congress to flout the will of a majority of Americans on major issues, as reflected in public opinion polls.

<p></p>Candidates and parties that rig the outcome of elections in their favor by preventing candidates from having a fair chance to defeat them adopt extremely partisan stances on political issues and prospective legislation for two reasons. One is due to the fact that there is usually no one to oppose them in future elections. The other is due to the fact that extreme stances help them raise money from special interests to pay for future electoral campaigns. 

<p></p>The result is that decision-making at the Congressional level in Washington, D.C. is gridlocked much of the time, paralyzing the federal government. This is true even in the face of life-threatening crises such as those caused by climate change/disruption and extreme weather. Even though legislative policies and programs are desperately needed to prevent and cope with future injuries, deaths and destruction caused by extreme weather, the U.S. is alone among industrialized countries with respect to its failure to enact and implement far-reaching policies and programs for dealing with this clear and present life-and-death threat.

<p></p>One of the most counter-productive things these politicians do in their conflict-producing mode is to deliberately aggravate and even instigate inter-group conflicts among people from different regions of the country and different socio-economic backgrounds, ethnicity, race, color, religion, etc.

<p></p>The tensions and antagonisms they fabricate are really disappointing to me because of my European background as a citizen of Switzerland as well as the U.S. with parental roots in Denmark, Germany and Ireland.  I have observed that people and lawmakers in these countries usually <i>can and do</i> find ways to live together and govern their countries without the kind of vitriol that plagues U.S. politics.

<p></p><b>Necessity: The Mother of Invention</b>
<p></p>These disheartening discoveries that the U.S. no longer has a fully functioning democracy are what motivated me to create a new technology to re-invent failing democracies, the <a href=""http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=%22Interactive+Voter+Choice+System%22.TI.&amp;OS=TTL/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Interactive Voter Choice System</a>.
 
<p></p>In addition to the reasons I have already given for turning to technology, an even more important reason is that this technology enables us to leap frog over technologically obsolete processes for electing governments and enacting legislation.

<p></p>The electronic data processing capabilities that are part of the invention make it unnecessary for electorates in democracy forms of government to be dependent any longer on a few hundred lawmakers to make laws for hundreds of millions of people who have virtually no say in lawmakers' decisions, and the laws they decide to pass or reject.

<p></p>Modern web technologies like those incorporated into the <a href=""http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=%22Interactive+Voter+Choice+System%22.TI.&amp;OS=TTL/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Interactive Voter Choice System</a>, and the reinventdemocracy.net  global consensus building social network, make it possible to <i>vastly expand  </i>the number of people who participate actively in elections and play an ongoing and determining role in guiding the legislative decisions of their elected representatives and policy makers.

<p></p>As a member of the team that launched one of the first large scale social networks, the $1 billion consumer network, <i>Prodigy</i>, I experienced first hand the unique power of social networking technologies to connect large numbers of like-minded people who would otherwise never be able to find each other. 

<p></p>The rise and global expansion of the Internet has created unprecedented opportunities for large scale, politically-oriented, social network and web-based collective action. When combined with my invention, this technological combination empowers voters across the political and ideological spectrum to join forces to fundamentally transform democracies that have been undermined by minority rule by special interests into democracies with majority rule by the people.

This technology-based empowerment, in my opinion, is the only realistic, near-term  option we have for overcoming the corruption and partisan disagreements and conflicts that have been created by special interests in concert with political parties beholden to them. 

<p></p>Research has shown that most people have legislative preferences and 
priorities that cross partisan lines and do not fit neatly into the 
ideological confines of political parties. However, since political 
parties do not allow their supporters to vote on their agendas, supporters have no choice but to accept ideologically-based party platforms even when they do not embrace key planks within them. 

<p></p>The result is that voters are unable to articulate their priorities 
across the board or give lawmakers legislative mandates based on voters' priorities. The citizens of typical democracies are saddled with paralysis-prone governments where small numbers of highly partisan, polarized lawmakers jockey to take advantage of every opportunity to misrepresent and ridicule each others' political stances.  

<p></p>Since we cannot change this <i>status quo</i> using traditional reform processes, and countries with stalemated governments are bringing entire nations, and possibly the whole community of nations, to the brink of disaster, I would argue that the most promising and possibly the only option we have for implementing an immediate system-changing solution is the Re-Invent Democracy Web Technology. 

<p></p><b>Transnational Voting Blocs and Electoral Coalitions</b>
<p></p>In closing, and with reference to the proliferation of violent cross-border conflicts that are occurring around the world, I want to call attention to the capacity of the Re-Invent Democracy Web Technology to enable democracy stakeholders around the world to build winning voting blocs and coalitions <i>across </i>countries as well as <i>within </i>countries.

<p></p>When the reinventdemocracy.net website is fully developed, any individual, group or organization will be able to form a voting bloc and coalition to solve any national or transnational problem, crisis or conflict anywhere in the world. These blocs and coalitions can include anyone they wish, including and especially people from different countries and regions who may be associated with transnational conflicts and crises. Together, they can explore solutions and collectively discuss, debate and vote on these solutions.

<p></p>They can continually reach out to bring in new members and grow so large that lawmakers and policy-makers will have no choice but to pay attention to their recommendations because the blocs and coalitions will have the votes in the countries involved in the crises and conflicts to determine who is actually going to be elected and who is going to be defeated.

<p></p>After these <i>transnational </i> blocs and coalitions set common agendas using the Re-Invent Democracy web technology, they can build voting blocs and electoral coalitions <i>in their home countries</i> dedicated to enacting the agendas of their <i>transnational </i>blocs and coalitions. These domestic blocs and coalitions can pressure incumbent lawmakers to enact their agendas, and subsequently nominate and elect lawmakers to replace them if necessary to enact the agendas originally set by the <i>transnational</i> blocs and coalitions.

<p></p>This technological leap forward will dramatically increase the prospects of avoiding the typical escalation of cross-border conflicts that we see when heads of state make war-and-peace, life-and-death decisions among themselves without the approval of their constituents. 

<p></p>In contrast, the Re-Invent Democracy technology will enable us to take the high road to world peace and majority rule simultaneously. Ordinary people at the grassroots will be able to join together online to build consensus behind their own collectively devised, collaborative solutions to these difficult conflicts, and directly transmit their peace plans in real time to every decision-maker involved. Their plans will get the attention they deserve from lawmakers because their blocs and coalitions will be able to acquire the voting strength they need to determine the outcomes of future elections.

Q&A for the Re-Invent Democracy Team
Question: What is your mission?
Our mission is to accelerate the evolution of democratic forms of government as they incorporate advanced information technology, telecommunications and social networks. 

In particular, we plan to use our Re-Invent Democracy Web Technology to solve a public sector crisis that the public sector is unable to solve - the global governance crisis - by enabling voters across the political spectrum to build consensus and end conflicts that far too many governments are failing to resolve.

This global governance crisis is jeopardizing progress on virtually every front. It stems from the failure of governing institutions and lawmakers to devise effective solutions to life-threatening crises and conflicts in a manner that serves the public interest and responds to their constituents' needs and demands.

It also stems from the disconnect between lawmakers and their constituents, and the increasing tensions and confrontations occurring between them. Small numbers of lawmakers enact laws for millions of people who often encounter insurmountable obstacles when they try to use electoral and legislative processes to determine who is elected and what laws are passed.  

Our goal is to ensure that governments and elected officials serve the people they represent. Right now, far too many governments around the world are disconnected from the people they should be representing because lawmakers put the demands of special interests ahead of the needs of their constituents. 

The Re-Invent Democracy Web Technology enables people to take direct action to overcome this disconnect and replace failing governments with governments elected by and for the people. It empowers people from all walks of life to join forces to set common agendas and build winning voting blocs and coalitions that are large enough to decide who runs for office, who gets elected and what laws are passed. 

The technology provides voters across the political and ideological spectrum access to a common website, reinventdemocracy.net, where they can meet online to build consensus about legislative priorities and solutions to any problem, crisis or conflict occurring at any level, within and across national boundaries. 

All they will have to do to use the technology free of charge on this website is to create an account by providing a screen-name and a valid email address. Then they can set up their individual home page and obtain an internal email address so they can get started setting their agendas and connecting with like-minded voters with similar agendas.  

Voters will be able to take the lead in consensus building, in concert, if they wish, with lawmakers, political parties, electoral candidates, issue groups, unions and civil society organizations of their choice. Together, they can form transpartisan online voting blocs and coalitions that cross partisan lines around transpartisan agendas for solving any problems, crises and conflicts they wish to address.
 
By building consensus on the part of ever larger numbers of voters across the political and ideological spectrum, blocs and coalitions can create transpartisan electoral bases larger than the electoral base of any single political party. By so doing, blocs and coalitions can run and elect their own slates of candidates to enact their agendas. If they decide their elected representatives have failed to exert their best efforts to enact bloc and coalition agendas, they can run new slates of candidates to replace them in forthcoming elections.

To fulfill this mission, we plan to build the world's first large scale consensus building and conflict resolution platform. Our social networking website, reinventdemocracy.net, will merge social media and politics to meet the unmet needs of the nearly three billion people who use social networks. 

Surveys indicate a surge of worldwide discontent with elected officials and governments that are locked in political stalemates and conflicts and and put the demands of special interests ahead of the public interest. The platform will enable those who are losing faith in democratic electoral and legislative processes to reform and re-invent them by inserting new voter-controlled consensus-building structures into these processes that can work with lawmakers to devise workable solutions. 
 
Our goal is empower voters to re-invent failing democracies by overcoming the disconnect between ordinary people around the world and their governments. Most people have little say in government decisions affecting their lives and well-being.

Unfortunately, this disconnect is leading to government-caused stalemates, crises and conflicts, within and across national borders, which are making it increasingly difficult for people to obtain jobs that pay living wages and afford the basic necessities of life. These difficulties are largely due to the fact that elected representatives tend to put the laws demanded by special interests ahead of the needs of their constituents. This is most likely to occur when lawmakers depend on special interest money to get elected, which is the case with the large majority of U.S. lawmakers. 


We think this technology will prove especially useful in countries like the U.S. where minority rule by special interests has paralyzed the federal government in Washington, D.C.

Legislative gridlock in the U.S. Congress is largely caused by uncompromising partisan conflicts among special interests, political parties and party representatives, while the needs of ordinary people and the public interest are ignored.

The unique Re-Invent Democracy technology can overcome these conflicts by enabling entire electorates to get control of elections and legislation. Voters can build consensus online around legislative agendas specifying what they want government to do, or not to do. They can email their priorities to their elected representatives and mandate them to enact their agendas or risk defeat in the next election. If they decide to vote against their elected representatives in the next election, they can build winning voting blocs and electoral coalitions to run and elect their own candidates.

We are seeking $500,000 to fund the first stage of developing our technology into the world's first large scale consensus building and conflict resolution platform. We will use the funds to develop and test the user-friendliness of our implementation of the technology in three prototypes. They include two global democracy building and social networking websites, as well as an online multi-party game of electoral strategy that shows players how to use the technology. 

Together, these offerings will provide voters the tools they need to get control of electoral and legislative processes.  They will be able to build winning online voting blocs and coalitions large enough to elect lawmakers without special interest funding to enact legislation that meets their needs rather than the demands of special interests.

Question: What is the technology?
Answer: The technology includes the recently patented Interactive Voter Choice System and the System for Playing an Interactive Voter Choice Game. 

We plan to make this technology available on the reinventdemocracy.net website and the reinventdemocracyfoundation.net website.

Question: How does the technology work?
Answer: It enables voters to build voting blocs and electoral coalitions that comprise broad cross-sections of the electorate and can acquire more political influence than political parties. 

These blocs and coalitions, which can comprise and align with political parties, can build electoral bases that surpass the voting strength of political parties and their ability to elect candidates of their choice.

Here's how:

Voters can use the technology to set their legislative agendas, connect with voters with similar agendas and form online voting blocs and electoral coalitions with like-minded voters.
Bloc and coalition members can vote on common agendas and common slates of candidates.
They can reach out to voters across the political and ideological spectrum to negotiate common legislative agendas that cross partisan and ideological lines.

Blocs and coalitions with transpartisan agendas can build transpartisan electoral bases with greater numbers of voting members than the electoral bases of any single political party.
Blocs and coalitions can use these electoral bases to elect their own slates of candidates, and hold their elected representatives accountable at the ballot box for enacting bloc and coalition agendas.

Our online multi-party game of electoral strategy shows players how to build winning voting blocs and coalitions.


Question: How do these voting blocs and coalitions compare to political parties?
Answer: There are three major differences:

Bloc and coalition members can vote on bloc and coalition agendas and slates of candidates, in contrast to parties that do not permit their members to vote on their agendas and slates of candidates before they are on the ballot.
Bloc and coalition agendas do not have to conform to particular ideologies or party lines and can include voters across the political and ideological spectrum.

Since blocs and coalitions can build larger transpartisan electoral bases than the electoral base of a single party, bloc and coalition candidates can defeat party candidates and win without special interest campaign contributions.

Parties and candidates typically limit voters' choices to voting for or against candidates already on the ballot who are running on agendas over which voters have little influence. 

In contrast, blocs and coalitions that use our technology, acting independently or in alliance with political parties, can run their own slates of candidates on ballot lines of their choosing.

Another difference is that political parties divide voters across partisan lines, while our technology unites voters across the political and ideological spectrum around transpartisan voting blocs, coalitions, agendas and electoral bases that cross partisan lines.


Question: How does the technology promote consensus building?
In order to grow large enough to win elections, our technology motivates blocs and coalitions to continuously reach out to new voters to build consensus. They can use it to open dialogues with prospective new bloc and coalition members an to discuss, debate and vote on common agendas and slates of candidates.  This drive to increase bloc and coalition voting strength encourages continuous consensus building by ever larger numbers of voters working together to set common legislative agendas.

Technically speaking, the technology's electronic data processing capabilities make it possible to connect voters, elected representatives, candidates, policy makers, and members of political parties, issue groups and non-governmental organizations online on a scale never before possible.  By discussing, debating and voting on agendas to resolve political problems, crises and conflicts, they can build large multi-stakeholder  voting blocs and electoral coalitions around common agendas and run and elect common slates of candidates.


Question: What are the ultimate goals of the technology, websites and game?
Answer: The goals are to enable voters and democracy stakeholders around the world to replace minority rule by special interests with majority rule by injecting voter-controlled consensus building structures and processes into elections and legislative decision-making. 

These structures and processes will enable them to put an end to the political stalemates and legislative gridlock caused by constant in-fighting among special interests, political parties and politicians. The reason they can do so is because they can grow transpartisan electoral bases large enough to defeat incumbents by running and electing their own candidates.

Question: Could failing democracies be reformed through traditional legislative and legal channels instead of relying on technology?

Answer: This is unlikely because democracies have fallen prey to deeply embedded obstructions in the form of campaign finance and election laws, etc. that prevent their electorates from deciding who runs for office, who gets elected, and what laws are passed. 

The large majority of lawmakers who use these obstructions to get elected would be unlikely to pass laws to overturn them -- especially U.S. laws and court decisions like Citizens United that allow special interests to make virtually unlimited contributions to political campaigns. 


Question: What is the impact of these obstructions?
Answer: 

Rigged elections.
Excessive partisanship on the part of uncompromising special interests, political parties and elected officials.
Legislative stalemates and gridlock caused by the refusal of lawmakers in opposing camps to resolve disagreements and conflicts in order to pass needed legislation.
Lawmakers' passage of laws that favor the interests of their special interest campaign contributors rather than those of their constituents.

Question: Can the Re-Invent Demcocracy web technology be used to solve transnational conflicts?
Answer: Yes, the technology enables voters to build transnational voting blocs and coalitions to solve transnational problems, crises and conflicts.

These transnational  blocs and coalitions can win elections in multiple countries by having their members create blocs, coalitions in their home country to elect lawmakers who pledge to enact the agendas of their transnational blocs and coalitions.

Blocs and coalitions can also influence decisions by their executive branches of government when they grow large enough to determine the outcome of future elections.


Question: Who is behind the Re-Invent Democracy web technology?
Answer: An international team of technologists, entrepreneurs and social scientists with public and private sector experience and roots in Denmark, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the U.S. (See list and biographies of team members below.)

The team is led by web entrepreneur and political scientist Nancy 
Bordier, Ph.D., who holds dual Swiss and U.S. citizenship.  She is the 
inventor of the Interactive Voter Choice System and the System for Playing an Interactive Voter Choice Game. She is also the founder and CEO of Re-Invent Democracy, Inc. and the Re-Invent Democracy Foundation Intl.

You can read her personal political story below describing the political events that led her to invent the technology.

Question: What do contributors to this campaign receive in exchange for their contributions?
Answer: The ultimate perk, when the reinventdemocracy.net website is fully developed, will be free access to the technology's agenda setting, political organizing and consensus building tools for building winning voting blocs and electoral coalitions.

Immediate perks include:

Membership in the Re-Invent Democracy Community hosted on the Re-Invent Democracy Foundation's global democracy building website, reinventdemocracyfoundation.net.
Membership in the Re-Invent Democracy Community hosted on the Re-Invent Democracy Foundation's global democracy building website.
Inclusion of the names of contributors in the Re-Invent Democracy Who's Who that will be published on the Foundation website.
Membership in the Foundation's e-Democracy Technology Consortium.

Subscription to the Citizens' Winning Hands® Game when it is completed.
Lifetime membership on the Re-Invent Democracy Foundation Intl Advisory Board.

Implementing the Technology
To ensure the technology provides trustworthy tools, the Re-Invent Democracy team is assembling an international team of developers to build and operate the platform in Switzerland.  It is a neutral country in the heart of Europe with strict privacy laws and advanced encryption technologies.

The team is taking a three-pronged approach to implementing the technology. It is developing and testing the user-friendliness of prototypes of two global democracy building and social networking websites, as well as an online multi-party game of electoral strategy that shows players how to use the technology's agenda setting, political organizing and consensus building tools.

The two websites are the reinventdemocracy.net  website and the reinventdemocracyfoundation .net website. The game is the Citizens' Winning Hands® Game, a multi-party online game of electoral strategy to be developed around the System for Playing an Interactive Voter Choice Game, a companion technology to the Interactive Voter Choice System.

REINVENTDEMOCRACY.NET
The reinventdemocracy.net website is being built around the core features of the  Interactive Voter Choice System contained in the patent issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (U.S. Patent No. 7,953,628). 

It comprises a ""computer based network"", a ""website on the Internet,"" and ""computerized databases of objects, each object representing a stance on a policy option of concern to voters."" The system, which creates ""aggregates of voters with similar preferred policy options"", is designed to enable voters to ""build consensus, coalitions and voting blocs that can run and elect their own candidates for office and induce elected representatives to enact their agendas.""

The system is unique in terms of its potential to connect democracy building stakeholders across the political and ideological spectrum, including electorates, elected representatives, electoral candidates, political parties, issue groups and non-governmental organizations around the world. 

For the first time in history, virtually unlimited numbers of individual stakeholders will be able to  connect to each other on a continuous basis; set their agendas, individually and collectively, across the board and partisan lines; and build transpartisan voting blocs, electoral coalitions and electoral bases that can elect lawmakers to enact their agendas.

Moreover, the technology possesses an inherent incentive and unprecedented potential to unite voters rather than divide them as political parties do, because it will connect multiple groups of stakeholders who might otherwise be divided along partisan lines.  They will be united by their goal of ensuring majority rule by building transpartisan blocs and coalitions from the ""bottom up"" by sharing their ideas, knowledge and needs while negotiating and voting on the priorities to be included in common transpartisan agendas.  

Thanks to this on-going consensus building process, the members of these blocs and coalitions will become more numerous and as well-informed as the small number of elected representatives and policy makers authorized to enact legislation and policies. When these officials receive mandates from blocs and coalitions, they will recognize that the mandates have been formulated by people who are as knowledgeable as they are, and possibly even more knowledgeable, because the mandates come from the grassroots and the people most affected by the legislation and policies in question. 

People, groups and organizations can choose their priorities in several ways, including composing their own priorities specifying the legislation they want to see enacted, as well as by using customized databases that will be accessible online on the reinventdemocracy.net website. 

Elected representatives, electoral candidates and political parties will also be able to use the technology to poll their constituents and supporters on a continuous basis to find out what their priorities are. 
They will be able to use the website to engage their supporters in discussing, debating and voting on their agendas.

Representatives and candidates who succeed in generating widespread 
support for common legislative agendas that they set with their supporters 
will be able to forge winning electoral bases of voting constituents without special interest financing. Elected representatives who know what their constituents want, and honor their constituents' priorities rather than those of special interests, will be able to cast their votes in legislative bodies without conflicts of interest. 

For example, if you are a member of any of these stakeholder groups, you can:

Set your own agenda of priorities regarding legislation you want lawmakers to enact.
Connect with people who have similar priorities in locations of your choice.
Join forces with like-minded democracy stakeholders to build voting blocs and electoral coalitions to discuss, debate and use the technology's voting utility to vote on common agendas, and pressure incumbent lawmakers to enact your agendas.
Nominate and elect your own candidates to replace lawmakers that your blocs and coalitions judge to have failed to exert their best efforts to enact the legislative mandates you have given them.
There are four ways your blocs and coalitions will be able to use the reinventdemocracy.net website to pressure lawmakers into enacting your agendas and hold them accountable if they fail to do so. 

You can:

Conduct large scale petitioning campaigns; use the voting utility to tally the number of signatories; transmit the petition to lawmakers electronically; and publicize the results via media of your choice.
Conduct online referendums that convey to your representatives your  immediate legislative priorities, using the voting utility to tally the number of votes cast to show them how many people advocate these priorities.
Conduct online straw recall votes to inform representatives and policy-makers who fail to exert their best efforts to enact your agendas and mandates how many people want to oust them from office immediately.
Defeat in actual elections lawmakers whose legislative track records are deemed unsatisfactory by your blocs and coalitions.

REINVENTDEMOCRACYFOUNDATION.NET
The reinventdemocracyfoundation.net website is being developed by the Re-Invent Democracy Foundation Intl to create a global community of democracy builders.

The goal is to increase the use of democracy building technologies to strengthen democratic forms of government around the world and overcome their vulnerability to obstructions that prevent majority rule.

This global community will comprise people from all geographical areas and walks of life, across the political and ideological spectrum.

It will include voters, elected representatives, policy-makers, members of political parties, issue groups, civil society organizations and international agencies that work nationally and transnationally.

The Foundation will encourage these stakeholders to play pro-active roles in utilizing web-based technologies that enable ever larger numbers of people to participate actively in electoral and legislative processes.

The Foundation's ultimate objective is to enable democracy stakeholders to elect governments and lawmakers who will enact legislation and policies that serve the majority will and the public interest. 

The website and community will provide you a variety of opportunities for communicating with the Re-Invent Democracy team and your fellow democracy-builders around the world. You will also be invited to share with us your views about the technology-based tools and services that will be provided to you free of charge on reinventdemocracy.net when it is fully developed, and ways and means to improve their effectiveness.

Interactive features such as the Re-Invent Democracy Community Blog, the Re-Invent Democracy Founders' Blog and The Democracy Exchange will facilitate dialogue, debate and exchange of information about challenges to majority rule in specific locations, and ways and means to use democracy building technologies to address these challenges.

In addition, the Foundation's E-Democracy Technology Consortium will provide technology developers opportunities to work with each other, democracy builders around the world, and the Re-Invent Democracy team to evaluate the effectiveness of existing and emerging technologies. 

The team will be inviting feedback and input from these groups as it seeks to enhance and integrate state-of-the-art and emerging technologies into the reinventdemocracy.net platform -- especially advanced technologies that protect user privacy. The Foundation will strive to become a global leader in facilitating the utilization of the most advanced encryption technologies.

THE CITIZENS WINNING HANDS® GAME
The Citizens' Winning Hands® Game is multi-party online game of electoral strategy that is being developed around the System for Playing an Interactive Voter Choice Game,  a companion technology to the Interactive Voter Choice System. It is called the Citizens' Winning Hands® Game because it is designed around two decks of cards.

The game will enable voters to learn how to use the agenda-setting, political organizing, and consensus building tools of the  Interactive Voter Choice System to form winning voting blocs and coalitions around common agendas and slates of candidates. 

A World Changing Game
The game belongs to a new genre of ""world-changing"" online games where players develop real world skills for making the world a better place by collaborating online.

The renowned game developer, Jane McGonigal, points out that many of the 500 million people who play online games every day — especially massively multi-player online games — prefer games of collaboration and camaraderie to games of warfare and aggression.  

She observes that these players are creating a global ""collective intelligence"" about ways and means by which ordinary people like themselves can dramatically improve the quality of human life and solve societal problems that cause preventable physical and emotional suffering.

McGonigal believes that many people play world-saving games because real world environments and institutions deny them the power to be heroic. Participation in these games adds meaning and happiness to players' imaginary lives by enabling them to make valuable contributions to their communities.

 While they are playing these games, they are developing interpersonal skills that they can put to use in the real world to play collaborative pro-active roles that enable them to join forces with legions of other people to solve problems causing human suffering.

 The Citizens' Winning Hands® Game belongs to this genre of world-saving game because it shows disillusioned voters who are losing faith in failing democracies and elections how they can collaborate online to assure majority rule by building voting blocs and electoral coalitions large enough to win elections. 

By playing the game, they will have an opportunity to see that the Interactive Voter Choice System enables entire electorates to get control of electoral and legislative processes and elect representatives who will enact their legislative mandates. 


THE RE-INVENT DEMOCRACY STORYby Nancy Bordier

A Rude Awakening
The story of the Re-invent Democracy web technology begins back in 2004 when I attended a campaign event for a U.S. presidential primary candidate. Six months earlier when the candidate first threw his hat into the ring, he advocated priorities similar to my own.

But as soon as he started to raise campaign funds from special interests, he drifted farther and farther away from his original priorities towards those of the special interests. He lowered the priorities of early supporters and actual voters like myself down on his list of priorities in order to make room at the top for the priorities of his special interest contributors.

But as soon as he started to raise campaign funds from special interests, he drifted farther and farther away from his original priorities towards those of the special interests. He lowered the priorities of early supporters and actual voters like myself down on his list of priorities in order to make room at the top for the priorities of his special interest contributors. 


When the candidate teleconferenced into the campaign event I was attending and started hedging on his priorities without giving us a chance to articulate our own, I came to a sudden and unexpected realization. U.S. election campaigns have become meaningless rituals in which voters are led to believe they are calling the shots when they are in fact pawns in a special interest-dominated process over which they have virtually no control.

The event was a disillusioning eye-opener for me. It motivated me to start paying closer attention to what was happening in Washington, D.C., where I observed a growing gap between voters' and lawmakers' priorities and the legislation enacted. The more I saw members of Congress vote against the priorities and needs of their constituents in favor of the priorities of their special interest campaign contributors, the more I came to doubt the U.S. has a fully functioning democracy at all.

Ten years later, my observations have been confirmed by numerous researchers, academicians, and political analysts. They have shown that special interests (such as organized economic and business groups that do not have a vote) often decide what laws are passed while average citizens and groups representing large numbers of voters have little or no impact.

Political Parties, Special Interests, and the Corruption of Democracy
Political parties are essential to democracy. The Re-Invent Democracy Web Technology enables voting blocs and coalitions to include and align with political parties of their choice, as well as to work independently of political parties. 

However, voting blocs and coalitions that use this technology will be able to circumvent and counteract the negative influence that political parties and candidates backed by special interests have been injecting into electoral and legislative processes. 

In the U.S., this negative influence derives from parties' and candidates' dependence on special interest money to win elections. Elections are no longer local because millions of dollars from external special interests flow into localities from outside to skew election results. They dwarf the contributions candidates received from people who actually reside in the district and have the right to vote.

The resulting dependency relationship between candidates elected by external special interest money and the special interest contributors themselves requires that candidates who are elected accept special interest demands regarding the passage or rejection of specific legislation. 

These dependency relationships also lead to the tendency of parties and their elected representatives to subordinate the public interest and needs of the American people to the priorities of their special interest backers.

My view is that these relationships have fundamentally corrupted democracy in the U.S. and ushered in minority rule by special interests. I do not see any way to put an end to this corruption other than by the Re-Invent Democracy Web Technology because the passage of enough legislative reforms to permit majority rule appears extremely unlikely. (See my article Un-Corrupting Congress: A System-Changing Solution.)

The reason I believe reforms are unlikely is because the obstructions of majority rule that the political parties and special interests have embedded in U.S. electoral and legislative processes at all levels of government are far too numerous and deeply rooted.

For example, the two major U.S. political parties have spent decades at the state level passing laws to rig the outcomes of elections by changing the boundaries of election districts in virtually every state. The representatives of the major party controlling a state legislature have changed election district boundaries in the state to include voters likely to vote for their candidates and exclude voters likely to vote against them. 

The electoral advantages the major parties have gained by changing boundaries are compounded by the unfair election laws they have also passed to prevent third parties from having a fair chance to run and elect candidates against major party candidates. As a result, the large majority of Congressional representatives live in ""safe"" districts that do not have competitive candidates on the ballot.

And, to make matters worse, many states have adopted laws, rules, regulations and technologies designed to suppress the vote. They actually prevent people from voting and having their votes counted. 

But that's not all. Parties and candidates who have rigged U.S. elections have also poisoned the waters of legislative processes in legislative bodies such as the U.S. Congress. They have done so in two distinct ways. One is by adopting such extreme, opposed stances that they can rarely agree to pass legislation. The other is to adopt rules and practices that allow a minority of members to block legislation supported by a majority of representatives. These Congressional minorities are also minorities of the population as a whole, enabling Congress to flout the will of a majority of Americans on major issues, as reflected in public opinion polls.

Candidates and parties that rig the outcome of elections in their favor by preventing candidates from having a fair chance to defeat them adopt extremely partisan stances on political issues and prospective legislation for two reasons. One is due to the fact that there is usually no one to oppose them in future elections. The other is due to the fact that extreme stances help them raise money from special interests to pay for future electoral campaigns. 

The result is that decision-making at the Congressional level in Washington, D.C. is gridlocked much of the time, paralyzing the federal government. This is true even in the face of life-threatening crises such as those caused by climate change/disruption and extreme weather. Even though legislative policies and programs are desperately needed to prevent and cope with future injuries, deaths and destruction caused by extreme weather, the U.S. is alone among industrialized countries with respect to its failure to enact and implement far-reaching policies and programs for dealing with this clear and present life-and-death threat.

One of the most counter-productive things these politicians do in their conflict-producing mode is to deliberately aggravate and even instigate inter-group conflicts among people from different regions of the country and different socio-economic backgrounds, ethnicity, race, color, religion, etc.

The tensions and antagonisms they fabricate are really disappointing to me because of my European background as a citizen of Switzerland as well as the U.S. with parental roots in Denmark, Germany and Ireland.  I have observed that people and lawmakers in these countries usually can and do find ways to live together and govern their countries without the kind of vitriol that plagues U.S. politics.

Necessity: The Mother of Invention
These disheartening discoveries that the U.S. no longer has a fully functioning democracy are what motivated me to create a new technology to re-invent failing democracies, the Interactive Voter Choice System.
 
In addition to the reasons I have already given for turning to technology, an even more important reason is that this technology enables us to leap frog over technologically obsolete processes for electing governments and enacting legislation.

The electronic data processing capabilities that are part of the invention make it unnecessary for electorates in democracy forms of government to be dependent any longer on a few hundred lawmakers to make laws for hundreds of millions of people who have virtually no say in lawmakers' decisions, and the laws they decide to pass or reject.

Modern web technologies like those incorporated into the Interactive Voter Choice System, and the reinventdemocracy.net  global consensus building social network, make it possible to vastly expand  the number of people who participate actively in elections and play an ongoing and determining role in guiding the legislative decisions of their elected representatives and policy makers.

As a member of the team that launched one of the first large scale social networks, the $1 billion consumer network, Prodigy, I experienced first hand the unique power of social networking technologies to connect large numbers of like-minded people who would otherwise never be able to find each other. 

The rise and global expansion of the Internet has created unprecedented opportunities for large scale, politically-oriented, social network and web-based collective action. When combined with my invention, this technological combination empowers voters across the political and ideological spectrum to join forces to fundamentally transform democracies that have been undermined by minority rule by special interests into democracies with majority rule by the people.

An Historic Political Transformation
The The Interactive Voter Choice System possesses an inherent and unprecedented capacity to empower the members of entire electorates to organize multi-stakeholder voting blocs and coalitions capable of building broad-based consensus. This technology-based empowerment, in my opinion, is the only realistic, near-term  option we have for overcoming the corruption and partisan disagreements and conflicts that have been created by special interests in concert with political parties beholden to them. 

Research has shown that most people have legislative preferences and 
priorities that cross partisan lines and do not fit neatly into the 
ideological confines of political parties. However, since political 
parties do not allow their supporters to vote on their agendas, supporters have no choice but to accept ideologically-based party platforms even when they do not embrace key planks within them. 

The result is that voters are unable to articulate their priorities 
across the board or give lawmakers legislative mandates based on voters' priorities. The citizens of typical democracies are saddled with paralysis-prone governments where small numbers of highly partisan, polarized lawmakers jockey to take advantage of every opportunity to misrepresent and ridicule each others' political stances.  

Since we cannot change this status quo using traditional reform processes, and countries with stalemated governments are bringing entire nations, and possibly the whole community of nations, to the brink of disaster, I would argue that the most promising and possibly the only option we have for implementing an immediate system-changing solution is the Re-Invent Democracy Web Technology. 

Transnational Voting Blocs and Electoral Coalitions
In closing, and with reference to the proliferation of violent cross-border conflicts that are occurring around the world, I want to call attention to the capacity of the Re-Invent Democracy Web Technology to enable democracy stakeholders around the world to build winning voting blocs and coalitions across countries as well as within countries.

When the reinventdemocracy.net website is fully developed, any individual, group or organization will be able to form a voting bloc and coalition to solve any national or transnational problem, crisis or conflict anywhere in the world. These blocs and coalitions can include anyone they wish, including and especially people from different countries and regions who may be associated with transnational conflicts and crises. Together, they can explore solutions and collectively discuss, debate and vote on these solutions.

They can continually reach out to bring in new members and grow so large that lawmakers and policy-makers will have no choice but to pay attention to their recommendations because the blocs and coalitions will have the votes in the countries involved in the crises and conflicts to determine who is actually going to be elected and who is going to be defeated.

After these transnational  blocs and coalitions set common agendas using the Re-Invent Democracy web technology, they can build voting blocs and electoral coalitions in their home countries dedicated to enacting the agendas of their transnational blocs and coalitions. These domestic blocs and coalitions can pressure incumbent lawmakers to enact their agendas, and subsequently nominate and elect lawmakers to replace them if necessary to enact the agendas originally set by the transnational blocs and coalitions.

This technological leap forward will dramatically increase the prospects of avoiding the typical escalation of cross-border conflicts that we see when heads of state make war-and-peace, life-and-death decisions among themselves without the approval of their constituents. 

In contrast, the Re-Invent Democracy technology will enable us to take the high road to world peace and majority rule simultaneously. Ordinary people at the grassroots will be able to join together online to build consensus behind their own collectively devised, collaborative solutions to these difficult conflicts, and directly transmit their peace plans in real time to every decision-maker involved. Their plans will get the attention they deserve from lawmakers because their blocs and coalitions will be able to acquire the voting strength they need to determine the outcomes of future elections.

awaiting the huge benefits of mainstream adaptive fashions –  from an easier time getting their child dressed to the convenience of shopping for adaptive versions of popular brands at major
retailers.


WHO WE'RE HELPING


In the U.S. alone, 1 in 20 kids has a disability
     that impacts their ability to dress themselves and/or wear the same styles
     as their friends.





Parents struggle to find functional, fashionable
     clothing for their children and must often spend additional money to alter
     “typical” clothing.

Existing adaptive clothing is not fashionable or
     representative of what peers are wearing.






Adaptive clothing currently has no retail
     representation. It is only available online.
Children with disabilities do not view themselves as
     different and, as such, should not have to dress that way. 


OUR MISSION
Runway of Dreams, the first 501c3 nonprofit
organization of its kind, aims to be the authority in incorporating
modifications to fashionable and affordable clothing for children and teens
with physical disabilities. We strive to be the much-needed voice of the ONE in
20 kids who has a disability, changing the fashion landscape so that it’s
inclusive of everyone.  
Clothes DO Make a Difference
Runway of Dreams has identified
wearable technologies that enable clothes to be easily adapted (e.g., adjustable
sleeve or pant lengths, waists, closures) to meet a person’s individual needs.
For example, we have teamed up with Maura H. Horton, founder and President of
Magna Ready and MagnaMini, to use her patented washable magnets to create
clothing samples.


Runway of Dreams has already begun
meeting with major designers and retailers to demonstrate the simplicity and
effectiveness of adaptive clothing. Our initial market research – and personal
experiences – also allow us to open decision-makers’ eyes to the large and
loyal customer base for adaptive clothing. The first question often asked by
many in the fashion industry is “Why hasn’t anyone done this before?” 
The goal is that designers and
manufacturers will offer adaptive versions of their existing clothing lines,
and retailers will make these items available on-line and in-store for
consumers.

</p><p>Of course, the cost of making the suits is a big part of this.  All figures here represent the estimated

cost $800.  Three fabric banners are currently being printed for
summer fairs in and around Toronto and business cards featuring a
photograph from the Summer Collection will be printed.  Sew-in labels
and hang tags will also be needed for this new collection. These
printing expenses will cost around $700. TOTAL COST OF IMAGING, WEB &amp; PRINT

We like to call it, ""Get Warm. Give Warm.®"" and we want to give away as many coats as possible.We are excited about the outdoors, especially snowsports. We love great design. But most importantly, whether it's work or play, we want it to mean something. That is why we've dedicated our business to serving others the best way we know how. For many children whose families don't have the means to supply them with a quality winter coat, being in school is the warmest part of their day. In many areas of the country, the winters are severe enough to make a walk to school painful, if not impossible without proper winter attire.While coat donation drives help with the issue, the total donations received annually only scratch the surface for helping the amount of children in need.Here at Agent Outerwear, it is our goal to create a sustainable solution to this problem.We are seeking your help to fund our inventory purchase of our fully developed line of coats and fleeces. All we have left to do to make this dream a reality is to make the purchase. Being able to supply inventory for sale means that we will be able to supply coats for kids, and that's really what we're here to do.But we don't expect you to just give us the money! We have some awesome deals, specially priced for this campaign. And with every donation for a hat, fleece jacket or coat, we will donate one to a child in need.Here is your chance to get Agent gear at  incredible savings!For more details about our products, we invite you to visit agentouterwear.com.Please be sure to select the correct size fleece or coat for your perk.

<h3><strong>Battery-Free Automatic Movement  </strong></h3>
<p>To create a unique way to tell time, Georges and I also collaborated directly with Miyota to modify their 9100 movement.</p>
<div data-id=""19009882""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Rush does not need batteries or to be &quot;hand wound&quot; but uses your body's natural movements when worn to power itself."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1513277054/kkv0lcbwmrvkxwgv0iiq.png"" src=""""/><figcaption>Rush does not need batteries or to be ""hand wound"" but uses your body's natural movements when worn to power itself.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>The Rush timepiece runs on a modified automatic movement, meaning it runs on the energy you create with no need for a battery or to be wound by hand.  </p>
<p>The Miyota 9100 is incredible; it's a hacking movement loaded with ""complications"" often not seen in a movement. We took an already complex design and modified it, switching out all the complications for disks.</p>
<h3><strong>Complex Rotating Disk Watch Dial  </strong></h3>
<p><b>Rather than ticking hands, the Rush disks rotate where the hands would normally be placed on the face of a watch.</b></p>
<div data-id=""19010049""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""The rotating disks give Rush an entirely unique and individual look."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1513277055/ha7valhmqzbl9da5jg7b.png"" src=""""/><figcaption>The rotating disks give Rush an entirely unique and individual look.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>The more complications on a mechanical timepiece the more intricate the building process. We had to modify Rush's movement to be able to support, carry, and move the added weight of the disks efficiently while still measuring time accurately.  </p>
<p>GSP's Rush is designed to be among the most elite, complicated watches. It offers incredibly layered complications: Time <i>(center disk)</i>, Date <i>(numerical indicator bottom right)</i>, Day<i> (left disk)</i>, Month <i>(right disk)</i>, Day/Night<i> (sun or moon disk bottom center)</i>, and Power <i>(top center needle)</i>.</p>
<h3><strong>Unique Curved Steel Watch Case  </strong></h3>
<p><b>The non-traditional curvature sets Rush apart from other luxury watches in both its feel and in its aesthetic.</b></p>
<div data-id=""19188420""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1513277056/srkc52j3szl1skufyhvr.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Only available by Egard Watches, Rush's specially designed curved case fits the curve of your wrist perfectly, for a comfortable and distinct look.</p>
<p>One of the continued notes about this case is how well it conforms to your wrist. Regardless of wrist size, this piece maintains a perfect level of presence while still feeling incredibly comfortable because of how it wraps to the curvature of your own wrist.  </p>
<p>Further, the durable AA case plating method (10x thicker than the industry standard PVD plating) makes the Rush casing hard to scratch and is comprised of 100 microns compared to standard PVD at 5 to 10 microns.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Scratch Resistant Sapphire Crystal  </h3>
<p><b>Rush is scratch resistant with our Sapphire Crystal design that is specially created to fit our unique curved case with low reflection.</b></p>
<div data-id=""19010229""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Rush's curved sapphire leverages the skills learned on William Shatner's &quot;Passages&quot; timepiece in 2013."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1513277056/vzgvm3kwmfl7xjhizlnn.png"" src=""""/><figcaption>Rush's curved sapphire leverages the skills learned on William Shatner's ""Passages"" timepiece in 2013.</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Sapphire crystals are expensive, have to fit the case perfectly, while also not have to much refraction and reflection. To curve a Sapphire on both ends while addressing sizing, fit, and reflection is a technical nightmare. </p>
<p>Luckily, we learned a technique on the William Shatner Passages collaboration and can now recreate this wonderful effect. As far as I know, we are the only ones making a sapphire crystal of this type.</p>
<h3>Luxurious Genuine Leather Watchband  </h3>
<p><b>Complementing the elegant watch face is a high-quality leather watch strap that brings the watch together to easily match with any style.</b></p>

<p> </p>
<p>Rush's standard watch strap is not your average band; its luxurious high-quality leather looks great and feels great on your wrist. Depending on your style of choice, Rush comes with either a blue or black watch band that compliments each design.  </p>
<p>With the Rush Box Set upgrade (details below), you'll receive a gorgeous steel bracelet with carbon fiber highlights to match the watch face and a rubber sports strap.</p>

<ul><li>
<b>AUGUST</b> <b>2016</b> — I decided to talk to Georges about my passion for watches, discussing a few I've created in the past, and showed excited and wanted to create one.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>NOVEMBER</b> <b>2016</b> — Georges and I got together, started to discuss the fundamentals of horology and watchmaking. Our collaborative design process had begun. All these complications (the technical term for features) alone are something often not seen in a movement but to then take such a complex design and modify it to not have the traditional display of hands but instead rotating disk is incredibly difficult. We essentially switched out all the complications for disks.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>DECEMBER</b> <b>2016</b> — Our first prototype was finished and it did not work. I had a realization that the disks were too heavy for the movement which stopped it from keeping time and allowing the disks to rotate. These disks rotate where the hands would originally be displayed to show you the information in a different and more unique way. </li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>DECEMBER</b> <b>2016</b> — Near the end of last year, I reached out to Miyota, we also began to also collaborate directly to modify their 9100 Movement to ensure 'Rush' could work as the way Georges and I designed it to. The disk posed certain difficulties such as placement and weight of the disks themselves (which the movement has to be strong enough to turn) which is why we worked directly with Miyota.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>MARCH</b> <b>2017</b> — Our second prototype was working perfectly and passed all our Quality Control! </li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>MAY</b> <b>2017</b> — Georges made an announcement about 'Rush' at Tao in Las Vegas, which was the official start of the 'Rush' timepiece.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>JUNE</b> <b>2017</b> — Our final production model is complete and ready for my father and I to mass produce and deliver.</li></ul>

Why CrowdfundingThe Rush watch is currently pre-selling on Indiegogo. This lets us cut out the distributors and wholesalers to offer the piece at over 50% discount for a limited time and get feedback directly from you, the customer! If you love the Rush timepiece now is the time to get in on this amazing watch!Due to an amazing reception of the Rush timepiece we have opted to add Superluminova on disks as a bonus to all our supporters! We opted to create Rush in two different movements and pricing categories with subtle differences between the two.  Our high-quality quartz watch allows for an affordable option, while our automatic has a build quality only seen in high-end luxury boutique brands.  
Automatic — A mechanical watch (modified Miyota 9100) where the mainspring is wound automatically by motion, providing energy to power the watch. The automatic Rush uses sapphire crystal. 
Quartz — A battery operated watch that uses an entelectronic oscillator that is regulated by a quartz crystal to keep time. The quartz Rush uses a hardened mineral crystal and has chronograph functions instead of the Day/Date/Month features found on the automatic version.No matter what movement you choose, this luxurious timepiece is the perfect daily reminder of strength and precision in and out of the ring.  Georges 'Rush' St. Pierre is one of the greatest and most accomplished fighters in MMA history, a legend.Styles from right to left: Stealth, Rose, Night, Aqua, Classic.Georges is a mixed martial artist and a three year champion of UFC, having won the title in 2006 and 2008, as well as an Interim title in 2007 and most recently the middleweight title against Michael Bisping.  He is often cited as the greatest MMA fighter of all time and the most accomplished in history. Georges retired in 2013, holding the record for most wins in title bouts and the second longest combined title streak in UFC history (2,204 days).  Georges has always dreamed of creating a watch that symbolized his career as a lifetime mixed martial artist and UFC champion, so I reached out more than willing to help him realize this dream.A Timepiece Designed with the Qualities of a Champion:  Thanks to the creative and design input from Georges, our collaboration is truly one of a kind and sure to become an iconic, limited edition collector's piece in the future.""To create something legendary, you partner with a legend."" - Ilan Sruvolicz, Egard Watch Co.After many meetings, our final collaborative vision was to create a timepiece with accuracy, timing, precision, and power—all qualities of both a champion fighter and a luxurious timepiece:  
Accuracy — Its 28,800 vibrations per hour, 26 jewels, and its modified Miyota 9100 made this piece incredibly accurate.  
Timing — A battery-free, automatic movement is made for reliability, years of use, and powered by natural wrist movement.  
Precision — A complicated, modified automatic movement displays 7 disc dials efficiently and accurately.   
Power — The reserve power indicator displays how much charge is left in your Rush watch for up to 42 hours. My name is Ilan Srulovicz. I founded Egard Watch after designing my first watch as a tribute to my father in 2012.Ilan Srulovicz and his father, for whom the first watch was designed.I built Egard Watch Company on the principle that a watch is not something you simply put on your wrist but something far more precious.  The first timepiece I designed was in 2010 for my father to honor the unbreakable bond between parent and child. It was my goal to create inspiring luxury pieces that embody the depth of emotion we each feel for the people in our lives who have defined our own important moments.   Egard's third collaboration in our tribute collection:  Through the years, I've had the privilege to work with many actors, professional athletes, and artists to design custom timepieces with a few collaborations going into limited run productions.
Peter Srulovicz — In 2011, I designed a special timepiece as a tribute to my father. This was the official start of Egard Watch Co. and what I built the foundation of my watchmaking company on.  
William Shatner — In 2013, Bill and I initially designed his ""Passages"" timepiece as a gift to his grandchildren. Shortly thereafter we rolled out a 3,000 unit limited edition production run on Indiegogo driven by the demand of his fans.  
Georges St. Pierre — Carrying on the tradition started with Bill Shatner, Georges and I collaborated this year to create a commemorative watch that would honor his legacy in the sport of mixed martial arts.  Still to this day, my father and I work in our Los Angeles and Toronto offices to design and manufacture all of Egard’s pieces together.    Accuracy, timing, precision, and power - all things needed in both a champion fighter and a luxurious watch.Rush has unparalleled design aspects with special details commemorating Georges St. Pierre's career and designed by Ilan Srulavicz of the Egard Watch Co.Named after Georges ""Rush"" St. Pierre, this luxury timepiece is the perfect daily reminder of strength and precision in and out of the ring. The effortless automatic movement, quality materials, and a one of a kind design is something GSP fans and watch fans alike will appreciate.Rose: Gold/Rose (left) — Night: Steel/Black (center) — Stealth: Black/Black (right) Classic: Steel/White (left) — Aqua: Steel/Blue (right) Unique Time Telling like no other watch.The three center disks rotate and align to show the time with the outermost disk displaying minutes, the middle disk in hours, and the centermost disk in seconds.

Battery-Free Automatic Movement  
To create a unique way to tell time, Georges and I also collaborated directly with Miyota to modify their 9100 movement.
Rush does not need batteries or to be ""hand wound"" but uses your body's natural movements when worn to power itself.
The Rush timepiece runs on a modified automatic movement, meaning it runs on the energy you create with no need for a battery or to be wound by hand.  
The Miyota 9100 is incredible; it's a hacking movement loaded with ""complications"" often not seen in a movement. We took an already complex design and modified it, switching out all the complications for disks.
Complex Rotating Disk Watch Dial  
Rather than ticking hands, the Rush disks rotate where the hands would normally be placed on the face of a watch.
The rotating disks give Rush an entirely unique and individual look.
The more complications on a mechanical timepiece the more intricate the building process. We had to modify Rush's movement to be able to support, carry, and move the added weight of the disks efficiently while still measuring time accurately.  
GSP's Rush is designed to be among the most elite, complicated watches. It offers incredibly layered complications: Time (center disk), Date (numerical indicator bottom right), Day (left disk), Month (right disk), Day/Night (sun or moon disk bottom center), and Power (top center needle).
Unique Curved Steel Watch Case  
The non-traditional curvature sets Rush apart from other luxury watches in both its feel and in its aesthetic.

 
Only available by Egard Watches, Rush's specially designed curved case fits the curve of your wrist perfectly, for a comfortable and distinct look.
One of the continued notes about this case is how well it conforms to your wrist. Regardless of wrist size, this piece maintains a perfect level of presence while still feeling incredibly comfortable because of how it wraps to the curvature of your own wrist.  
Further, the durable AA case plating method (10x thicker than the industry standard PVD plating) makes the Rush casing hard to scratch and is comprised of 100 microns compared to standard PVD at 5 to 10 microns.
 
Scratch Resistant Sapphire Crystal  
Rush is scratch resistant with our Sapphire Crystal design that is specially created to fit our unique curved case with low reflection.
Rush's curved sapphire leverages the skills learned on William Shatner's ""Passages"" timepiece in 2013.
Sapphire crystals are expensive, have to fit the case perfectly, while also not have to much refraction and reflection. To curve a Sapphire on both ends while addressing sizing, fit, and reflection is a technical nightmare. 
Luckily, we learned a technique on the William Shatner Passages collaboration and can now recreate this wonderful effect. As far as I know, we are the only ones making a sapphire crystal of this type.
Luxurious Genuine Leather Watchband  
Complementing the elegant watch face is a high-quality leather watch strap that brings the watch together to easily match with any style.

 
Rush's standard watch strap is not your average band; its luxurious high-quality leather looks great and feels great on your wrist. Depending on your style of choice, Rush comes with either a blue or black watch band that compliments each design.  
With the Rush Box Set upgrade (details below), you'll receive a gorgeous steel bracelet with carbon fiber highlights to match the watch face and a rubber sports strap.
    

Each Rush timepiece has a limited edition numbering case back honoring Georges' career while showcasing the watch's movement.

Unfortunately, to ensure accurate delivery, we cannot hand select numbers on a case by case basis.

Our choices in watch components are high quality to ensure a luxury timepiece, while maintaining everyday practicality.

Georges and I initially met at mixed martial arts training a few years ago and got to know each other over the years.
Early sketch of Georges and my design for Rush.
After an intensive design phase between Georges and myself, Rush has been prototyped and is ready to begin a limited run production. 
 
An initial CAD rendering of the 'Rush' design.
  

AUGUST 2016 — I decided to talk to Georges about my passion for watches, discussing a few I've created in the past, and showed excited and wanted to create one.

NOVEMBER 2016 — Georges and I got together, started to discuss the fundamentals of horology and watchmaking. Our collaborative design process had begun. All these complications (the technical term for features) alone are something often not seen in a movement but to then take such a complex design and modify it to not have the traditional display of hands but instead rotating disk is incredibly difficult. We essentially switched out all the complications for disks.

DECEMBER 2016 — Our first prototype was finished and it did not work. I had a realization that the disks were too heavy for the movement which stopped it from keeping time and allowing the disks to rotate. These disks rotate where the hands would originally be displayed to show you the information in a different and more unique way. 

DECEMBER 2016 — Near the end of last year, I reached out to Miyota, we also began to also collaborate directly to modify their 9100 Movement to ensure 'Rush' could work as the way Georges and I designed it to. The disk posed certain difficulties such as placement and weight of the disks themselves (which the movement has to be strong enough to turn) which is why we worked directly with Miyota.

MARCH 2017 — Our second prototype was working perfectly and passed all our Quality Control! 

MAY 2017 — Georges made an announcement about 'Rush' at Tao in Las Vegas, which was the official start of the 'Rush' timepiece.

JUNE 2017 — Our final production model is complete and ready for my father and I to mass produce and deliver.",37.0,2,"2 Campaigns

Impenetrable Cryptography We know that it is in the public's best interest for impenetrable security solutions to be widely available. Privacy is a right that is not to be taken lightly and not to be taken away.Rogue agencies, individuals, and activist groups have overstepped their bounds and we are issuing them a challenge: You will not be able to crack our protocol.We have developed a patent pending, low latency, streaming encryption protocol that is changing the face of network security and keeps prying eyes away from your network traffic.Our team is steeped in technology. We bring nearly a century of combined telecommunications, software, networking, and security experience. We hail from Fortune 500 companies, the U.S. Military, government contractors, and startup companies and have decades of higher education behind us. We have successfully led and contributed to multi-million dollar corporate projects involving critical systems with no tolerance for failure.With our protocol developed and the patent filed, sights are set on embedding the technology into an industrial grade plug-and-play cryptographic device that allows ultra-secure communications between any two points on any IP network, public or private.If you help us to reach our goal you will enable us to fully bring our protocol to market, allowing it to be licensed for use in any number of devices for use in home, office, government, and industry. In addition, upon reaching our goal, we will launch a community challenge program, in which we will offer a bounty to several individuals or teams who successfully and uniquely crack the security protocol and show proof of repeatability. The bounty will be 10% of any crowdfunding proceeds, up to a $250,000 bounty and will be cumulative, so if the bounty is not claimed and we start another round of crowdfunding, the bounty will start off at the previously unclaimed amount. See below for details and eligibility info.What We NeedOur patents have been filed. Now, we need to raise money for a number of things.

<h3>Our Impact</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>VOZ is our hope for a profoundly different design model.  We offer rural design workshops to foster an extraordinary creative dialogue between artisans, designers and the public.</p>
<p>Today many traditional weavers in Latin America struggle to make a living practicing their craft because cheap knockoffs have saturated their local marketplaces. This makes it nearly impossible for rural weavers to sustain themselves by selling their craftwork. Often the pressure is so great that artisans are forced to stop practicing their ancestral art forms.  VOZ now provides materials and fair trade wages to a community of 27 weavers and seamstresses, and can dramatically scale these professional opportunities as we grow.</p>

<p><em>Margarita Ñanculef Calfín, VOZ Co-Founder, prepares yarn for weaving.</em></p>
<p>Mainstream fashion design has come to depend on globalized unhealthy production chains that surround us with countless disposable objects.  Mass-produced fashion has disrupted the relationship between maker and wearer. VOZ is committed to reconnecting community via collaborative design. </p>
<p>At VOZ, our artisan partners proudly protect and cultivate indigenous art forms and techniques, often reviving ancient knowledge about weaves, dyes, and symbols.  We envision a future for fashion, in which ancient wisdom, sexy style, cutting edge innovation, and global problem solving are the elements that compose beautiful clothing.</p>

<p>Jasmine, a fine artist and designer, was born and raised in California where she studied product design at Stanford University.  She has dedicated her life’s work to serving community through art and design, including performance arts events, furniture design, graphic design, and fashion. The seeds of VOZ began when Jasmine studied ceremonial design with Q'ero shamans in the Peruvian Highlands in order reconnect product design to craft and cultural story-telling. She partnered with a Chilean NGO the Chol Chol Foundation where she met an incredible community of Mapuche weavers in Southern Chile who had been working over the last thirty years to rescue and develop their ancestral weaving techniques. Jasmine proposed a program for contemporary fashion to compliment their traditional art in order to help them reach new audiences.</p>
<p>Our early prototypes were widely coveted in trade shows in 2010, but we needed to start a business to cull the resources necessary to begin. In 2011 our first successful crowd-funding campaign launched an eight-month design workshop series in Temuco, and we went on to win Start Up Chile and Fundación Chile. This allowed VOZ to train a community of artisans and develop a mini-collection, Fall Winter 2012, which recently hit the shelves for this autumn and is now being carried by eight retailers.  This progress has been wonderful, but we have yet to develop over a hundred prototypes and ideas from our work last year and fulfill our dream of a full fashion collection of 30 clothing pieces and expanded accessories.</p>
<p>Today VOZ is materializing beautifully thanks to the extraordinary team and community that has come together over the last year and half, including Lorena Mardones, Kyra Davis, Karen Ladenheim, Maria Eugenia Maliqueo, Mercedes Montalva, Jess Brown, Irys Kornbluth, Fabian Castro, David Guendelman, Natasha Huang, Justine Massey, Jeannette Valenzuela and Artisan Directors Pascuala del Carmen Leal Vásquez, Irma Lincoqueo, Jacqueline Virginia Valdevenito Monasterio, Julia Torres, Margarita Ñanculef Calfín, Maria Veronica Currivil Nahuel, Marta Isabel Huitraiñan Aillapán, Rosa Isabel Ñanculef Huircapán, Zenobia Currivil Nahuel, Sandy Sandoval, Marcie Valdevenito, Anita Luisa Paillamil Antiqueo, Sonia Catrileo Jaramillo, Ana Currivil, María Huento, María Levil Yevilao, Isabel Currivil, Rosa Mora, Erna Isolina Vallejos, Marisol Adriana Cruces Liempi and Nina Alonso.

<div>As simple as it may seem, I started my career as a fashion designer by watching my mother, hovering over her shoulder while she sewed.  When I was a little girl she had a line of children's clothing she named ""Sabrina's Closet,"" after me, and would spend <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1247.photobucket.com/albums/gg630/sabrinabradley/a19150aa.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>hours in our living room sewing little jackets out of African prints lined with fluffy quilted fabrics and I would literally just stand and watch. I was fascinated by the bright colors, the noise of the machine, and the scissors she told me I could, ""Never use to cut paper!""  And though she never let me touch anything on her table, she could see I was interested and began teaching me the basics:  ""Cut out all nessacary pattern pieces,"" she said.

</p><b>HOW IT ALL BEGAN<br/>One evening my daughter came back home from an outing with her friends:</b><p><b>""Pa, my friends and I were talking, it's so frustrating every time I go out I have to carry around two pairs of shoes.  Is it possible to invent a shoe that could transform into flats? Here's what I think."" I listened to her ideas and thought it's possible. So began our project.</b><br/></p><h3>Important Points</h3>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>First Dehappyheels models are reserved specially for Indiegogo backers. This is the first
	generation (Colombe Gen I).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shoes are delivered to backers
	with zero cost/or appropriate discount when campaign is
	successful. Backers eligible for discount are our top priorities. 
	 That is why we have included a  stand alone
	manufacturer warranty to be enacted upon final agreement with
	manufacturer.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We will keep finalizing our
	product until its latter stages to make sure that our backers have
	the best Colombe Air Shoe aka D2H (DeHappyHeels) 
	</p></li>
<li>The first stage of this campaign is finalizing our prototype. The second stage deals with large scale manufacturing.  <br/>

RECEIVE SPECIAL DISCOUNT IN PRODUCTION .</b>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>OUR GOAL<br/></p><p>We were concerned  with elegance and efficiency. Movement had to be limited and swift. The transition had
to be as comfortable as possible, to insure better comfort we also
worked on the sole.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br/></p><p>The Colombe Fashion &amp; Comfort Air Shoe aka DeHappy Heels was designed with great care. It took years tinkering. There were many possibilities. At the end we opted for the best mechanism: clean and simple. The invention comprised of combination of soles, a heel mechanism with an optional variant. The Shoe is designed with flexible components.</p><p>Wear it erect for your special occasions and the heel will remain sturdy as your classical high heels, or wear it is a flat. This is possible because our patent pending mechanism has a revolutionary system that allows lock in core. In either positions. Once you decide to walk more comfortably the shoe will transform to a flat shoe position. The entire apparatus becomes alive with the simple push of a button. We can achieve this because we have designed DeHappy Heels to follow the humans natural foot dynamic. We have not forced the mechanism onto the foot. We have adapted the shoe to the foot. It is here that we depart from ancient systems. We have allied elegance and functionality while respecting the natural dynamics of the foot.</p><p>We have always been concerned with the problems posed by high heeled shoe pains; with our patent pending solution we have largely solved this issue. By studying the foot and finding better ergonomic as well as mechanical solutions. We covered everything: heels, sole, arc, toes, ledger, flesh and bones. We created a shoe where women could be elegant in their heels as well as enjoy the benefit of sneaker like integration. It was out of the question for women to pull out their heels or to resolve in so called collapsible schemes. We wanted a clean and simple solution. A smooth system, one that was elegant, comfortable, healthy and efficient.<br/></p><p><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p>It’s a discreet machine in itself.
Yet it is light, invisible, smooth, effective and sturdy. In order to
reach this goal we went through loads and loads of material. We
inspected large number of shoes. Considered all kind of heel's their
height, forms and dimensions. Did it have to be big, small, could it
still be elegant? Yes, yes and yes. We could get all of that done.
We could create a collapsible heel that will not be removable. A heel
that will change from one position to another at the push of a
button. And it could be elegant too!</p>
<p>	Then we had to consider the right
material. Leather? Rubber? Plastic? How about the heel? Will it be
made of wood then covered with leather like classical model?
Perhaps new type of hard rubber? After sweating over this issue for a
while we discovered elastic leather that were strong, elegant,
fashionable and most importantly were already tested by manufacturers
for years. There are also synthetic materials getting better and better everyday. The shoe indeed has to be flexible. The heel inside
mechanism was another story. It had to be efficient and simple. For that is the mark of all great things. As for inner material? We have thus far settle for titanium. It
is strong, and light.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/292915/files/20140105173845-9b_GoldShoes.jpg?1388972325"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>	 Owing to the best available material DeHappy Heels is set to be just right for its purpose. Special soles follows foot physiology to the detail. Our revolutionary design  gives to the foot smooth repository while
adjusting to weight. This
creates an even distribution of sensibility that varies from toes to
heel as nature wants it. The result is a comfortable experience both
in the shoes high heel position as well as in its flat shoe position.</p>

</p><p>We are working on an independent
apparatus that will allow shoe manufacturer to adapt the heel
mechanism to their existing shoes without having to reinvent the

with the newly refined heel mechanism we are also working on subtlety
without the sole itself.

Here's what I think."" I listened to her ideas and thought it's possible. So began our project.Important Points



First Dehappyheels models are reserved specially for Indiegogo backers. This is the first
	generation (Colombe Gen I).


Shoes are delivered to backers
	with zero cost/or appropriate discount when campaign is
	successful. Backers eligible for discount are our top priorities. 
	 That is why we have included a  stand alone
	manufacturer warranty to be enacted upon final agreement with
	manufacturer.

We will keep finalizing our
	product until its latter stages to make sure that our backers have
	the best Colombe Air Shoe aka D2H (DeHappyHeels) 
	
The first stage of this campaign is finalizing our prototype. The second stage deals with large scale manufacturing.  

What We Need & What You GetSUPPORTERS
RECEIVE SPECIAL DISCOUNT IN PRODUCTION .




OUR GOALWe were concerned  with elegance and efficiency. Movement had to be limited and swift. The transition had
to be as comfortable as possible, to insure better comfort we also
worked on the sole.

The Colombe Fashion & Comfort Air Shoe aka DeHappy Heels was designed with great care. It took years tinkering. There were many possibilities. At the end we opted for the best mechanism: clean and simple. The invention comprised of combination of soles, a heel mechanism with an optional variant. The Shoe is designed with flexible components.Wear it erect for your special occasions and the heel will remain sturdy as your classical high heels, or wear it is a flat. This is possible because our patent pending mechanism has a revolutionary system that allows lock in core. In either positions. Once you decide to walk more comfortably the shoe will transform to a flat shoe position. The entire apparatus becomes alive with the simple push of a button. We can achieve this because we have designed DeHappy Heels to follow the humans natural foot dynamic. We have not forced the mechanism onto the foot. We have adapted the shoe to the foot. It is here that we depart from ancient systems. We have allied elegance and functionality while respecting the natural dynamics of the foot.We have always been concerned with the problems posed by high heeled shoe pains; with our patent pending solution we have largely solved this issue. By studying the foot and finding better ergonomic as well as mechanical solutions. We covered everything: heels, sole, arc, toes, ledger, flesh and bones. We created a shoe where women could be elegant in their heels as well as enjoy the benefit of sneaker like integration. It was out of the question for women to pull out their heels or to resolve in so called collapsible schemes. We wanted a clean and simple solution. A smooth system, one that was elegant, comfortable, healthy and efficient.

It’s a discreet machine in itself.
Yet it is light, invisible, smooth, effective and sturdy. In order to
reach this goal we went through loads and loads of material. We
inspected large number of shoes. Considered all kind of heel's their
height, forms and dimensions. Did it have to be big, small, could it
still be elegant? Yes, yes and yes. We could get all of that done.
We could create a collapsible heel that will not be removable. A heel
that will change from one position to another at the push of a
button. And it could be elegant too!
	Then we had to consider the right
material. Leather? Rubber? Plastic? How about the heel? Will it be
made of wood then covered with leather like classical model?
Perhaps new type of hard rubber? After sweating over this issue for a
while we discovered elastic leather that were strong, elegant,
fashionable and most importantly were already tested by manufacturers
for years. There are also synthetic materials getting better and better everyday. The shoe indeed has to be flexible. The heel inside
mechanism was another story. It had to be efficient and simple. For that is the mark of all great things. As for inner material? We have thus far settle for titanium. It
is strong, and light.






	 Owing to the best available material DeHappy Heels is set to be just right for its purpose. Special soles follows foot physiology to the detail. Our revolutionary design  gives to the foot smooth repository while
adjusting to weight. This
creates an even distribution of sensibility that varies from toes to
heel as nature wants it. The result is a comfortable experience both
in the shoes high heel position as well as in its flat shoe position.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My name is Darian Jerard Bagley and I have a unique clothing idea that I want to get into every department store in America and around the world.</p>
<p>I'm not your normal clothing designer.  In fact, God has placed many ideas in my head over the years and I'm attempting to bring this one to life.  I'm actually a TV and Film producer by trade and have been so for over 20 years.</p>
<p>I've worked for the most part in the Philadelphia area producing local content/stories for FOX-TV, NBC 10, PBS-WHYY TV 12, and I even won 2 Emmy's in 1996 for ""The Sounds of Phildelphia"".  I've also worked for Mr. Bill Cosby on his Philadelphia production of ""You Bet Your Life"".</p>
<p>I'm reaching out to the Indiegogo community because I have a great clothing idea that I've been selling at Flea Markets, Craft shows and Door-To-Door but would like to see it in every department store in America.  </p>
<p>I am motivated by the positive support and response I have received about this product over the years and support from Indiegogo will allow me to:</p>
<p>     1. Create an Inventory</p>
<p>     2. Build a great interactive Website</p>
<p>     3. Participate in Clothing Trade shows around the world</p>
<p>     4. Develop the packaging and a Department store display </p>
<p>     5. Produce a TV commercial to air nationally</p>
<p>If the goal of $10,000 isn't reached, the money that is raised will go directly to creating an inventory, marketing and building the website so that we can continue to raise money to move forward with the other goals.  The main purpose is to become a shining example of how to follow thru with your dreams no matter how long or hard the journey is.  </p>
<p>Not only is ""SCHAT"" a totally original design, but it takes an old idea and transforms it into a newer product that has multiple uses.  It will also serve as an example of that old saying that ""No idea is a bad idea, and dreams can come true if you work hard and believe in yourself.""</p>

<p><strong>                              WHAT MAKE TRAKLINE BELTS BETTER &gt;&gt;</strong><br/><br/><strong>1 - PERFECT FIT:  </strong>In this ever-changing world, you need a belt that adapts with you, every <em>1/4 inch </em>of the way. Trakline Belts conform to your exact waist size, every time.</p>
<p><strong>2 - ADJUSTABILITY:  </strong>With over 40 sizing positions, Trakline Belts are 8X's more adjustable than traditional belts.</p>
<p><strong>3 - NO HOLES:</strong>  That's right.  No more worn-out, stretched-out, augmented, poor-fitting belt holes to deal with. Instead a modern, hidden trak system.</p>
<p><strong>4 - STYLE:</strong> Designed for MEN who care about their appearance, our buckles are simple, smart and distinctive. </p>
<p><strong>5 - QUALITY:  </strong>We could make our belts out of less expensive materials, but we like quality stuff.  The buckles are solid stainless steel and the belts are full-grain leather (the best).<br/><br/>&gt;&gt; featured on: <a href=""http://www.dudeiwantthat.com/style/accessories/trakline-fits-like-a-glove-belt.asp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong> </strong><strong>Dude I Want That</strong></a>, <a href=""http://gearhungry.com/2013/05/trakline-belts.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Gear Hungry</strong></a><strong>, <a href=""http://www.shoppersbase.com/37614/trakline-the-new-style-belt-for-men-means-no-more-holes/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ShoppersBase</a> &amp; <a href=""http://www.crowdfundmafia.com/blog/mafia-approved/2013/05/21/mafiaapproved-trakline-belts-chechil-usa/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Crowdfund Mafia</a></strong></p>

It's that simple. Not only do Trakline belts fit much better than traditional belts, but they're easier to take on and off AND they last longer.  Watch the video and see for yourself - because seeing is believing... </p>
<p><strong>We recently completed a successful KICKSTARTER campaign to fund the first production run</strong><strong>!  Thanks to our supporters - mission accomplished :)<br/><br/></strong><strong>Now we're on INDIEGOGO</strong><strong> to accomplish two additional goals.</strong><strong><br/><br/></strong><strong>First, we need the funds to design, develop and prototype more product styles, and second,</strong><strong> we want to give back to a great charity &gt;&gt;</strong><strong> Working Wardrobes. <br/><br/>Of course to accomplish all this we need your support. </strong><strong>In return, we want to give you the best belt you'll ever own...</strong></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/581/860/814439b9191e87c0b194750f79555de1_large.JPG?1368226551"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong><strong><strong>                                                  Visit us @ </strong><a href=""http://www.Trakline.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>www.TRAKLINE.com</strong></a><br/>OUR STORY<br/></strong></strong>Two years ago my wife bought me an expensive, designer belt for my birthday. She wanted to upgrade my wardrobe. Unfortunately for me, the belt holes didn't line up with my waist size that day. So I did what a lot of guys have done, I added a couple holes. But in the process &gt;&gt; I ruined the belt. Needless to say, my wife was not happy.<strong><br/><br/>INSPIRATION</strong><br/> I learned 2 simple lessons that day.  First, never puncture any gift from your wife and second &gt;&gt; belt holes don't work all that well. Not much of a surprise, considering they were introduced during the ""Dark Ages"" and really haven't changed since.</p>
<p>Consider that as you work, walk, eat, sleep, play (or even diet) - your waist size naturally fluctuates. Unfortunately, traditional belts only offer you 1 inch spaced holes. Who's waist fluctuates 1 inch at a time?  Not mine. So I made it my mission to find a better fitting belt &gt;&gt; that looked good too. But when I scoured the marketplace... I came up empty. That's when I got inspired to create a whole new kind of belt. </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/581/853/9a530ab0a9444f916edbc02e44fc16a9_large.jpg?1368226470"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>THE BOTTOM LINE</strong><br/> Every man knows that belt holes aren't fun to deal with. They stretch-out, wear-out and rarely seem to fit just right. Don't you think you deserve a belt that not only looks great, but fits perfectly too ? ...We think so.<br/><br/><strong>CREATING A NEW KIND OF BELT</strong><br/> After a year and a half of designing, sampling, prototyping and testing &gt;&gt; we came up with the <strong>TRAKLINE BELT</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/552/286/4c161ec5b5f381f98da4b36189fd1819_large.jpg?1367269007"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

Next, we designed a unique (<strong>PATENT PENDING</strong>) buckle to interface with the belt and give you over <strong>40 sizing positions</strong> all in <strong>1/4 inch increments</strong>. That <strong>8X's more adjustable</strong> than your traditional belt. When a Trakline belt is pulled snug around your waist, the buckle locks firmly at your <strong>exact waist size</strong>. The result = a simple, stylish belt that offers the perfect fit, every time. (see photos)</p>
<p><strong>WHAT ABOUT QUALITY ?</strong><br/> We designed Trakline belts to last &gt;&gt; because we like quality. The buckle is constructed of solid stainless steel (with brushed nickel finish) and the belt is full-grain leather (the best) with double stitching. Yes, the buckle does contain a small amount of nickle (as is necessary) to stabilize the steel.</p>

<p><strong>HOW DO YOU KNOW I'LL LOVE IT ?</strong><br/> When we completed the final samples, we handed them out to a few friends and associates to test for us. The only problem was, when we went to get the belts back, no one wanted to give them up. All the guys loved their new belts, they said it was the best fitting, best quality belt they ever had and above all &gt;&gt; they didn't want to go back to their old belts.</p>
<p><strong>WHY INDIEGOGO, YOU ALREADY DID KICKSTATER ?</strong><br/>Yes, we recently completed a successful campaign on Kickstarter to raise the funds for our first production run. Thanks to our supporters, we far surpased our initial goal.  But unfortunately after the campaign was over there were still two things we wanted to accomplish that we hadn't planned or budgeted for. We wanted to design, develop and prototype new product styles, and we wanted to give-back in a meaningful way.</p>

So when I approached Mauro and Steve with my idea to create a new kind of men's belt, both thought it was a great idea who's time had come and jumped at the chance to get involved.

<p>For the past 15 years Mauro has been in product manufacturing and quality control.

<p><strong>CHALLENGES</strong><br/> Fortunately, as a team we've been involved in manufacturing and product development for over 20 years and know the pitfalls and snags to watch out for. And we have a successful, existing relationship with the factories involved.<br/><br/> Still, we understand that all this doesn’t completely eliminate all the the challenges and obstacles going forward.</p>
<p>In our case, timing is the biggest obstacle. In the best-case scenario, we will have belts in hand 5-6 weeks after this campaign is over and turn these around in as little as 2 weeks, getting the belts in the mail on time.  If, however, there's a delay of any sort, the worst case scenario is that we could be delayed another 2 weeks (approximate).  Of course, our intent is to get all the orders done ahead of schedule, rather than behind. But in the end &gt;&gt; we want to create the best quality belt possible.</p>

The result: a perfect fit at my precise waist size, whether it's Liquid Diet Monday or Chicken & Waffles Saturday."" - Dude I Want That.com !""What we love about Trakline belts is that each belt fits to your exact waist size, every time you put it on. So if you are having a fat day, there is no need to punch an extra hole to give you a little more breathing space, just pop on a Trakline belt and fit it to your exact waist size."" - ShoppersBase.com
""Never again worry about being between belt holes. Trakline Belts are reinventing the wheel for men’s belts. They fit your exact waist size every time with over 40 positions!"" - The Crowdfund Mafia

CHALLENGES Fortunately, as a team we've been involved in manufacturing and product development for over 20 years and know the pitfalls and snags to watch out for. And we have a successful, existing relationship with the factories involved. Still, we understand that all this doesn’t completely eliminate all the the challenges and obstacles going forward.
In our case, timing is the biggest obstacle. In the best-case scenario, we will have belts in hand 5-6 weeks after this campaign is over and turn these around in as little as 2 weeks, getting the belts in the mail on time.  If, however, there's a delay of any sort, the worst case scenario is that we could be delayed another 2 weeks (approximate).  Of course, our intent is to get all the orders done ahead of schedule, rather than behind. But in the end >> we want to create the best quality belt possible.
 
                             Thanks for your time and support !

<h2><em>TAKE ENERGY WITH YOU - WHENEVER, WHEREVER</em></h2>
<p>FlameStower is a small, portable power source that captures the energy from open flame - campfires to cookstoves- and converts it direct into electricity. Outlets?! We don't need no stinking outlets! Just bring a FlameStower - one end in the fire, some water in the can - and within a minute you're charging your cell phones, GPS, AA and AAA batteries, whatever you need to keep your adventure charged! </p>
<p>FlameStower keeps <em>all of us</em> online when we're off-grid:</p>
<ul>
<li>outdoor adventurers who want a light-weight, easy to use, durable power supply</li>
<li>professionals requiring reliability over all else, NO FRAGILE PARTS, an ideal solution where IT lasts mere hours</li>
<li>communities in the developing world where cell phone use is increasing way ahead of affordable electricity.</li>
</ul><p>The low power demands of modern devices change the way we think about energy: one of the most powerful tools the world has known – a cellphone allowing instant communication and limitless knowledge – now fits in your pocket and needs only five volts to keep going.</p>
<p>We're making ways to keep people connected and simultaneously ease the demand for power grids throughout the world, encouraging energy efficiency from everyday activities and giving <em>all </em>people the power of electricity, any time, anywhere. </p>

<h3><strong>Charging the World~ Because We Should</strong></h3>
<p>When we introduce people to FlameStower, we usually ask three questions: </p>
<ul>
<li>Do you have a cell phone? <em>Yes</em>. </li>
<li>What would happen if your battery died?<em> I’d cry.</em>
</li>
<li>When do you charge your cell phone? <em>At night</em>. </li>
</ul>
<p>When they see our device in operation, they usually ask a question of us: <em>why in the world hasn’t anyone done this before? </em></p>
<p>For a lot of us, the need for FlameStower isn't great - nothing is easier than plugging into the wall to get our energy. But <em>the grid</em> isn't everywhere.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">EMERGENCY USE</span>- How many times has your phone died and you have no means of charging it?  We aren't talking about lighting up a campfire in the street when you need to text someone, but think about people who break down on the side of the road and need to call for help.  The campers who get lost and need a GPS.  What a relief to have a dependable portable charger with an energy source that can be created anywhere!</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">BUSINESS OFF-GRID</span>- Many people work in remote areas- but they still report back to places where up-to-the-second technology is expected.  Peace Corps, Army, Navy, Greenpeace, forest rangers, the list goes on and on.  Having the FlameStower would allow these people to stay connected, no matter where they are!</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">GLOBAL AID</span>- Right now, there are over 700 million cell phones in Africa alone, double the amount in the United States, and only 40% of the people have access to electricity.  There is an enormous gap limiting access to global knowledge and spurring the demand for fast, cheap energy. By tapping into the one universal household energy, cooking dinner, FlameStower provides electricity to charge a cell phone, no grid required. Imagine the possibilities!</p>

<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://flamestower.com/assets/team-FST.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Meet the 'Stowers""/></p>
<p>FlameStower was founded out of Stanford's d.school in April 2012 and has grown to include:</p>
<p><strong>Andrew Byrnes</strong> - a Stanford materials science grad student, old man Byrnes returned to school after teaching, adventuring, writing novels, rolling sushi, and developing utility-scale wind and solar projects. Andrew is dedicated to cleantech and changing the way people relate to energy, and once yelled at Tom Cruise for illegal parking. DONATE TODAY!!</p>
<p><strong>Adam Kell</strong> - another matsci grad student, Adam developed novel Si fabrication processes with an area PV manufacturer while going to school and cycling the Santa Cruz Mountains.  Previous employment includes sustainable urban farming and selling motorcycles.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Duarte</strong> - Mark and Andy both come from beautifully-weird Tucson, AZ. A mechanical engineer at Stanford, Mark is a design genius who isn't afraid to push the limits of personal energy design or stake his devotion to Toby Keith.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Claussen</strong> - our fearless electric engineer, Matt's first day was spent trying to sell FlameStowers to a room full of VCs when all we had was a non-functional, highly dangerous chunk of hot aluminum. Got married last year to his wife Cristina; he knows the honeymoon is over because she's stopped laughing at his jokes</p>
<p><strong>________________________________________________________________________</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Finally...Some Details</strong></h3>
<p>Since our launch we've worked through a great number of engineering and design challenges. FlameStower works, but for a first generation product we feel it's important to give you some details about what you're buying and some of the experiences we've had. </p>
<p><strong><em>WILL IT CHARGE MY PHONE?</em></strong></p>
<p>YES! We've charged iPhones, iPods, Nokias, Samsungs, LGs, and run LEDs. We feel confident in FlameStower's ability to charge all devices through a USB connection, however some - specifically the iPhone 3GS and iPod touch - have been finicky. We're working through these issues and hope to have them resolved by the time we send your FlameStower. If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact us and we'll answer your questions. </p>
<p><strong><em>HOW FAST DOES IT CHARGE? </em></strong></p>
<p>FAST!  Depending on the temperature, between 1 to 2 minutes after being put in contact with the flame, FlameStower puts out a steady 5V USB charge. We're not as fast as charging from an outlet, but we're getting better...maybe with FlameStower 3G.</p>
<p><strong><em>THIS IS IN THE FIRE...IS IT DANGEROUS?? </em></strong></p>
<p>NOT ANY MORE DANGEROUS THAN A FRYING PAN.  Parts of the device get very hot during operation - thats how we operate - but our design lets you place it then leave it while your mobile devices charge a safe distance away. After the fire's out, let your FlameStower sit for a few minutes and you are good to go!</p>

<p>You know the old saying, ""you shouldn't put all your eggs in one basket"".  But now, with Thomas Hobbs, Jr's invention, The Unbreakable Egg Carton and Colorful Bubble Wrap you can!</p>
<h3>Design Features</h3>
<p>This product is a specially designed packaging enhancement for eggs that incorporates protective bubble wrap within each egg carton.  The cartons themselves would still be fashioned from the commonly used plastic foam or cardboard materials but would feature an increased interior area to accommodate the wrap as well as a convenient closure enhanced with Velcro. Lining each egg crevice as well as the top of the carton, the wrap would be fabricated of the plastic air cellular cushioning material similar to Bubble Wrap.</p>
<p>In addition, as the name of the product implies, the wrap would be offered in a wide variety of colors to further appeal to consumers. Thus packaged, eggs are completely swathed in this cushiony lining, which provides an effective buffer as the eggs make their journey from the farmer to the market.</p>
<h3>Advantages &amp; Benefits</h3>
<p>The Unbreakable Egg Carton &amp; Colorful Bubble Wrap would provide a simple, cost effective means of protecting fragile eggs during shipment and transport.  Incorporating, soft, cushiony bubble wrap inside egg cartons, this packaging enhancement would handily alleviate the breakage risk that is common with egg distribution.  In this manner, egg manufactures would be able to package and distribute this food in its perfect form.  As a result, consumers would not have to spend valuable time in the grocery store hunting through cartons to find one that is completely filled with undamaged eggs.  Thus, suppliers would not lose money on eggs that are unsellable.</p>
<p>The consumer would also benefit The Unreakable Egg Carton and Colorful Bubble Wrap, as this unique packaging idea would protect eggs up until the time as they are consumed in food preparation.  As such, consumers would be able to purchase eggs in confidence, ensured that the shells will not break even if the carton is dropped onto hard concrete.  Equipped with a Velcro closure, this packaging concept would provide additional security for the eggs stored inside, preventing the top from springing open on impact.</p>

Template-based App Making
Today, app making is extremely difficult with the few options available.
You could try to code yourself, but that would take a long time, and not everyone wants to do that.
You could try to outsource to developers, but that usually costs a lot of money. Simple apps cost about $5000 while more complex apps can cost anywhere from $50,000 to $200,000.
Some app making platforms have sprung up to consult these problems and indeed they do. However, we believe they didn't consult all the issues. That's why we made AppFlamingo.
What is it?
AppFlamingo is an online platform (a website) I created with friends in an attempt to make app making as easy as possible, while keeping the costs low.
The site is template-based, meaning that you can choose from a set of template we have made and then populate the templates with whatever is necessary, which depends on the template selected.
We think that the process will take less than 30 minutes with the development console we have made. We've shown the process for one template (fact) in the video.

Again, the site is template-based. Here are the templates we have developed so far for at least one platform.


Fact


Business


Quiz


Tower Defense


Blog



We don't want to reveal too much before we are ready to launch but the name of each template should make its function clear. If anyone is specifically curious about these templates feel free to contact me and I'll be happy to respond.
Is there a benefit to making apps?
Apps are growing in importance everyday because of growing smartphone usage. There are many reasons to make apps, and we will support as many of these reasons as possible. I've come up with a few reasons below:
Some people make apps as a venture for money. We will give you the option to choose whether or not to implement one of a few ad-networks. You will of course be able to set the price-point on your app.
Other people might find a more miscellaneous use to the apps. With the quiz-template a teacher could make an app for his or her classroom. A business could make use of both the business and blog template. Someone who just wants to make an app might have a very good idea for a tower defense game.
How much money does an app cost?
I've set the price at a one time payment of $45. Cheapest alternatives generally require $50 of recurring payment per month, per app over the year.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign
