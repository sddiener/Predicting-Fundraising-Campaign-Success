<p>The Artificial Intelligence in ""From Ashes"" will react to the player and change its tactics based on how you face them. if you try avoid dark areas or enclosed spaces then the threat will use this against you.

<p><b>Ammunition Usage  </b></p>
<p>This is a major subject as unlike the majority of FPS games where if you reload with half a magazine you keep the rounds. We intend to alter this trend among the gaming community by having a '<i>use what you have</i>' approach. If you reload after a single shot then that ammunition that was spare in the magazine will be lost. So ammunition conservation is a must if you wish to survive.</p>
<p><b>Weapon Upgrades</b> </p>
<p>Before you think of it, no we do not mean useless gold paint. We mean you get to fit attachments that can both help and hinder you in the game. These attachments range from sights and scopes; muzzle brakes; extended magazines and bullet types (Incendiary, Armour piercing, Exacto...)  . We will add as many upgrades as possible to offer you as many different unique play styles as possible and we are open to suggestions!</p>

<p><b>Destructible Maps</b></p>
<p>Like newer AAA games offer the ability to obliterate walls and other solid structures, we too are giving you this feature, but where you could only take certain walls out or break certain objects, our game will offer the ability to take any wall out and any object. However, the more walls you destroy the more unstable buildings will get. Don’t be scared of taking a few walls down as you never know what lies behind a wall or a locked door.</p>

<p>The reason we used Unreal Engine is for the streamlined visual scripting and the fantastic visuals that are nearly effortless as well as having Nvidia Physx already integrated in the engine.

From Ashes has been in the making for about a year now, getting all the assets right and prototyping different weapon configurations, animations ect. During this time and for some time before this a family became ill so I am going to donate 15% of all profit to the MS Society that help thousands of people with Multiple Sclerosis every year. (the 15% will be from profits on release not from backers)
Not enough game developers donate to charities and I am going to change try that by setting an example as you will see in our pictures and in our gallery.

The Project Details


From Ashes is a survival horror game based in a hospital for the mentally insane and mortally wounded, but the hospital has a secret… genetically modified experiments have broken loose. Your mission is to hold them back and stop them tearing the city apart, but beware they may be more of a hand full than you first think. 
From ashes offers players a game where the A.I. learns the player and changes to find weakness, it also offers real time bullet ballistics as well as real time ammunition usage, weapon upgrades and destructible maps all made possible with Unreal Engine 4.

(Bold features has further detail below)
A.I. That Learns
The Artificial Intelligence in ""From Ashes"" will react to the player and change its tactics based on how you face them. if you try avoid dark areas or enclosed spaces then the threat will use this against you. Also, based on if you are skittish or trigger happy while exploring the map and facing the threat the A.I. is more likely to run after you.The A.I. vary dramatically from one to another in looks and in behaviour.

Real Time Bullet Ballistics
This will be used to make the player choose how they play and make them more skilled due to the fact the they will need to take in to consideration: calibre, weight, velocity, distance, material (if shooting through walls etc.) and if the projectile is not a bullet then the shape will have to be taken into consideration as all of these will vary the performance of the bullet and can be the difference between life and death.
Through a plasterboard wall the direction of the bullet will be altered slightly. However, through sheet steel (thickness depending) the round will deform and the velocity will be dampened greatly.

The Story

In the late 1950's the lab technicians of a hospital captured a creature that was one of a kind. Massively intelligent, fast and as fierce as can be. They began taking samples of the specimen to study; soon after they started trials to mix the DNA of the creature and other living things.

You are the person they send in to clean up the mess and you're good at what you do but nothing can really prepare you for this.


What We Need & What You Get We need the funds to submit our game to Steam to get it Greenlit and for animators to animate our 'monsters' I personally can animate but not to the level of quality this game deserves as well as some other things


In a little bit more detail the animator that we used for the video is called Massimo Di Antonio. He found me when I posted the animation position on Freelancer.co.uk. I asked him to donate 3 full animations instead of being paid properly for them and if they were good there would be more work and that is exactly what he did! (to leave a review on the site it is a £10 minimum)



More features being: 


Dynamic weather
Day & Night
Back stories to all creatures including multiple variations of each




To find out what the next step is you'll just have to help us get there!
Modding support would cover things like weapons, characters/creatures and a level editor to make your own experience. 


   

    Risks & Challenges The biggest risk is that we don't get fully funded (we will get done as much as we can with the money raised but it will take longer to to release the game).
Other risks are that upon getting funded we run into a problem while scripting From Ashes but after several years making little games even for myself in Unreal Engine I'm pretty confident that I can either fix or work round any issues that may materialise.
But with all you support I'm certain that we will do great!

Though strong and usually wise, she's more than a little vain.Chieftain Kabbo: Leader of a luckless goblin tribe that's taken up residence on Mount Albans - and the first target of Emilia's wrath. Distressingly fond of crates.Zurba (Just... Zurba): Mistress of the Maelstrom. Though far closer to Emilia’s age than the rest of Fonelle's lieutenants, Zurba is just as powerful - and, like the storms she likes to summon up, every bit as unpredictable and violent.Banok the Mighty: Ogre wizard Banok rules over the rocky plains and canyons of the Towerlands with an authority bordering on outright tyranny. Though a magic user, his connection to the earth isn’t intellectual - he seems to be some sort of... muscle... wizard? Malsa the Ghost Queen: Queen of the ancient, magical kingdom of Ramilia - the last, thanks to an eldritch disaster that befell the land. Now Malsa's realm is inhabited only by the ghosts of her former subjects, over whom she rules - and cares for - from the crumbling ruins of her castle. Arshes, Flame Lord of Carus: Lord of the burning lands of Carus, Arshes is something of - well, let’s not beat around the bush, shall we? He’s a bratty jerk, which, when combined with considerable magical powers, leads to certain disaster. Naturally, he needs to be taken down.Survan of Ezurbar: Until recently, the elder sage of Ezurbar lived in a castle carved into the side of a glacier, far from the rest of his kinsmen. Now he lives in the royal palace, has turned most of Ezurbar's population into ice sculptures, and lets Fonelle’s monsters have the run of the realm. Jorin the Songweaver: A failed bard who discovered his own latent magical talents, Jorin has been tutored and shaped into a High Wizard by Fonelle herself - making him not only entirely loyal to her, but rather creepily devoted and slavish. He has transformed his realm into a place of music and song... so long as those songs are composed in Fonelle’s honor. Grumpy Witch is being developed by a combination of talented newcomers and industry professionals, passionate gamers one and all! Our design staff have previously been involved with a wide range of titles, including the Shantae and Scribblenauts series, Drawn to Life, City of Heroes,  Legends of Might & Magic, The Saboteur, Joint Operations, Mercenaries, and Red Alert III. In addition to knowing the ins and outs of fun, challenging games, they bring a wealth of project management expertise to the table. On the development side, we're supported by a seasoned group of Unity and C# programmers from both corporate and indie backgrounds. Finally, you may recognize some of our art team from their work with Gaia Online, various prominent game streamers, or tabletop games such as Breakfast Cult, No Country for Old Kobolds or the Fate Codex.To learn more about the individual members of Team Emilia, why not check out our website?Grumpy Witch will be a fully-voiced game, and we've already lined up some great talent to help bring our characters to life.

 We’ve been hexing away at Grumpy Witch since late 2015. Until now, our development has been paid by self-financing and private investment, but to deliver a game with a depth, variety, and polish that’ll really do justice to our concept, we need to find additional sources of funding. Crowdfunding, which has acted as a launchpad for a lot of great, innovative titles over the last couple of years, is an exciting opportunity for us to connect directly with fans and players. Your support not only keeps our development team going, but lets us show publishers and investors that there's real demand for games like Grumpy Witch out there.  $100,000 - Base Game Funded!At the base funding tier, Grumpy Witch will feature:
32 levels across 7 unique realms

You've got it! At $250,000, we'll add one new level to each of the game's 7 realms, bumping the total number of levels to 46. Emilia's arsenal of spells will also expand, giving her some dangerous new magic to play with. Finally, this funding level will allow us to develop a Playstation 4 port, making Grumpy Witch available to console gamers!$300,000 - Secret Levels + More Pets!More to explore! At this funding level, we'll add a clutch of sneaky secret levels to the game. Emilia's selection of pets will also expand, giving her several new friends to adventure with. $350,000 - Improved Mounts!Charge into battle in an all new way! At $350,000, Emilia's mounts get a serious tune-up with special attacks, unique movement abilities, and more.  $400,000 - Localization + Xbox One Release!  If we clear $400,000 in funding, we'll be able to hire the translators and actors needed to localize Grumpy Witch into one language chosen by backer polls, complete with a new voiceover track! This funding level will also give us the resources to develop an XBox One port, bringing the game to two major consoles. $450,000 - More Coolness!Extra mounts!

<h3>Progress</h3>
<p>Currently, <i>Episode One: Strange Neighbors </i>is finished and <i>Episode Two: The Wretched  </i>(previously named ""The Treacherous"") is in preproduction. Which means I'm finalizing the level design, dialog and overall script. Additionally, I'm also working on a Steam version and implementing translations for the game.  </p>
<p><i>Sally Face </i>is being developed as a solo, side-project by Steve Gabry (me); where I work on the game in my free time. I'm running this fundraising campaign with hopes of allowing for more dedicated/uninterrupted focus on development and to help get the episodes to you quicker.</p>

<p>This funding is needed for <i>Sally Face</i> to be completed as the original vision of a five episode narrative arc. With the funds to focus on development full time, instead of only a few hours a week, it would greatly benefit the production of the game and also aid in getting episodes out much sooner. Without funding, it is also likely that the five episode structure will need to be shortened a good bit. With your help, we can allow <i>Sally Face</i> shine in it's full, creepy glory. </p>
<p>The following is a description of how the funds will be used. </p>

<p><strong>Why are you making the game in episodes? </strong></p>
<p>There are a couple of reasons why I chose to develop the game in episodes. The original idea for <i>Sally Face</i> was conceived in 2007 and started off as a cartoon series. Later on, when I decided to revisit the concept, I knew I wanted to make an adventure game and thought that I would keep the cartoon/episodic format. It's how the story was meant to be told. Additionally, as a solo developer, breaking the game up into episodes helps me to focus on one piece of the story at a time and to get content to the public sooner. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>When's the next episode coming out? </strong></p>
<p><i>Episode Two: The Wretched </i>is currently in preproduction. I'm estimating it will be done by early/mid 2017. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How many episodes will there be? </strong></p>
<p>5 total episodes! </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What are your inspirations? </strong></p>
<p>Since the concept of <i>Sally Face </i>started off in the form of an animated series, most of the influence comes from 90's cartoons (the shows I grew up with) and my own life experiences. The inception of it all came from the idea of creating something similar to an old Nickelodeon cartoon like <i>Hey Arnold</i> or <i>Doug </i>and making it more warped/twisted/dark; something worthy of being on Adult Swim, next to shows like <i>Metalocalypse </i>and <i>Aqua Teen</i>. That idea and an early character doodle created the foundation of what <i>Sally Face</i> is today. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>What happened to Sally's face? </b></p>
<p>That's a story for another day :)</p>

Currently, Episode One: Strange Neighbors is finished and Episode Two: The Wretched  (previously named ""The Treacherous"") is in preproduction. Which means I'm finalizing the level design, dialog and overall script. Additionally, I'm also working on a Steam version and implementing translations for the game.  
Sally Face is being developed as a solo, side-project by Steve Gabry (me); where I work on the game in my free time. I'm running this fundraising campaign with hopes of allowing for more dedicated/uninterrupted focus on development and to help get the episodes to you quicker.
 

Portable Moose
Hi! My name is Steve Gabry, I'm an independent game developer from Pittsburgh, PA. I have 10 years experience in designing and developing video games. For my solo projects, I'm going under the name ""Portable Moose.""
In addition to this work, I am also a Game Designer at Wither Studios, LLC and Creative Director of Crowman & Wolfboy. 



This funding is needed for Sally Face to be completed as the original vision of a five episode narrative arc. With the funds to focus on development full time, instead of only a few hours a week, it would greatly benefit the production of the game and also aid in getting episodes out much sooner. Without funding, it is also likely that the five episode structure will need to be shortened a good bit. With your help, we can allow Sally Face shine in it's full, creepy glory. 
The following is a description of how the funds will be used. 

DETAILS
Development: Creating all of the elements that form a final game, such as artwork, animations, music, sound effects, dialog, story, game design and level construction.
Fees: Indiegogo and payment processing fees.
Safety Net:  Sometimes unforeseen costs may arise, planning for a little extra helps avoid unfortunate surprises. If not needed then this will be used for development. 
Rewards: Fulfilling all of the backer rewards, physical goods and shipping costs.




* Images for prizes are concepts and don't necessarily represent the final products.

Why are you making the game in episodes? 
There are a couple of reasons why I chose to develop the game in episodes. The original idea for Sally Face was conceived in 2007 and started off as a cartoon series. Later on, when I decided to revisit the concept, I knew I wanted to make an adventure game and thought that I would keep the cartoon/episodic format. It's how the story was meant to be told. Additionally, as a solo developer, breaking the game up into episodes helps me to focus on one piece of the story at a time and to get content to the public sooner. 
 
When's the next episode coming out? 
Episode Two: The Wretched is currently in preproduction. I'm estimating it will be done by early/mid 2017. 
 
How many episodes will there be? 
5 total episodes! 
 
What are your inspirations? 
Since the concept of Sally Face started off in the form of an animated series, most of the influence comes from 90's cartoons (the shows I grew up with) and my own life experiences. The inception of it all came from the idea of creating something similar to an old Nickelodeon cartoon like Hey Arnold or Doug and making it more warped/twisted/dark; something worthy of being on Adult Swim, next to shows like Metalocalypse and Aqua Teen. That idea and an early character doodle created the foundation of what Sally Face is today. 
 
What happened to Sally's face? 
That's a story for another day :)

I apologize for my bad English but English is not my first language (or the second). But do not worry, the game texts will be carefully revised by a professional once the game is finished.</p><p>I started making video games at the age of 20 for the MSX 2 system. Last year I released 4 new titles (in 1 single year).<br/>You can see my games (images and videos) in this link:<br/><a href=""Https://kai-magazine-software.fwscart.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Https://kai-magazine-software.fwscart.com/</a><br/>Unfortunately, making video games for an obsolete system is not well paid at all. I am divorced with 2 children and my only source of income currently comes from the video games I developed. I need your help to complete this PC remake.<br/>I am a very productive developer: Everything you see in the video or playable demo I have done in 1 month and a half. I only need 1 month and a half more to finish it, but I would like to add many more areas, enemies, abilities, visual scene and to extend the story beyond the original version. For that I need about 3 months to finish it as I would like, with all the visual stages and zones that I could not put in the original version of MSX.<br/>The graphics are completely remade, from an 8 bit look to a 16 bit look. I create the graphics on a PC that is more than 9 years old, with a drawing program that is about 20 years old and with a mouse (that is harder than you could imagine!)<br/>I do the Programming and mapping with Game Maker.<br/>I composed the soundtrack with an MSX 2 (an 8-bit computer from 1985).<br/>Even without resources, the game is looking quite well and development is progressing very fast.<br/>I would like to work on the game for another 3 months to add everything I want to add and finish it the way it was meant to be finished.<br/>In order to work exclusively for 3 months, I need to raise some 2000 euros to survive those 3 months (My children and I can survive every month with only 600 euros).<br/>That is why I ask your help to finish the game as it should.<br/>Of course, all the sponsors will be rewarded with a reduced pre-purchase price and in addition you will be included in the credits of the game.<br/>You can also access to exclusive rewards only available for this campaign.</p><p><strong>Worst case scenario:</strong><br/><br/>If I do not raise 2000 euros in this campaign, I will make similar campaigns on other crowdfunding platforms located in certain countries (kickstarter, Verkami ...)<br/><br/>If at the end we only manage to collect (for example) 1000 euros, I would finish the game 1 month and a half (which is the minimum time I need to finish it) and the game would already be much wider than the original MSX 2 version.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><i>Pero mírame, todo emocionado, hablando sin parar del juego!</i></p><p><i>Donde están mis modales?!</i></p><p><strong><i>Permitidme que me presente:</i></strong></p><p><i>Me llamo Oscar Kenneth Albero y vivo en España.

I apologize for my bad English but English is not my first language (or the second). But do not worry, the game texts will be carefully revised by a professional once the game is finished.I started making video games at the age of 20 for the MSX 2 system. Last year I released 4 new titles (in 1 single year).You can see my games (images and videos) in this link:Https://kai-magazine-software.fwscart.com/Unfortunately, making video games for an obsolete system is not well paid at all. I am divorced with 2 children and my only source of income currently comes from the video games I developed. I need your help to complete this PC remake.I am a very productive developer: Everything you see in the video or playable demo I have done in 1 month and a half. I only need 1 month and a half more to finish it, but I would like to add many more areas, enemies, abilities, visual scene and to extend the story beyond the original version. For that I need about 3 months to finish it as I would like, with all the visual stages and zones that I could not put in the original version of MSX.The graphics are completely remade, from an 8 bit look to a 16 bit look. I create the graphics on a PC that is more than 9 years old, with a drawing program that is about 20 years old and with a mouse (that is harder than you could imagine!)I do the Programming and mapping with Game Maker.I composed the soundtrack with an MSX 2 (an 8-bit computer from 1985).Even without resources, the game is looking quite well and development is progressing very fast.I would like to work on the game for another 3 months to add everything I want to add and finish it the way it was meant to be finished.In order to work exclusively for 3 months, I need to raise some 2000 euros to survive those 3 months (My children and I can survive every month with only 600 euros).That is why I ask your help to finish the game as it should.Of course, all the sponsors will be rewarded with a reduced pre-purchase price and in addition you will be included in the credits of the game.You can also access to exclusive rewards only available for this campaign.Worst case scenario:If I do not raise 2000 euros in this campaign, I will make similar campaigns on other crowdfunding platforms located in certain countries (kickstarter, Verkami ...)If at the end we only manage to collect (for example) 1000 euros, I would finish the game 1 month and a half (which is the minimum time I need to finish it) and the game would already be much wider than the original MSX 2 version.  Pero mírame, todo emocionado, hablando sin parar del juego!Donde están mis modales?!Permitidme que me presente:Me llamo Oscar Kenneth Albero y vivo en España. Empecé a hacer videojuegos a los 20 años para el sistema MSX 2. El año pasado lancé 4 títulos nuevos (en 1 solo año).Podéis ver mis juegos (imágenes y videos) en este enlace:https://kai-magazine-software.fwscart.com/Lamentablemente, hacer videojuegos para un sistema obsoleto no está nada bien remunerado. Estoy divorciado con 2 hijos  y mi única fuente de ingresos actualmente proviene de los videojuegos que desarrollo. Necesito vuestra ayuda para poder completar este remake para PC.Soy un desarrollador muy productivo: Todo lo que veis en el video o la demo jugable lo he hecho en 1 mes y medio. Solo necesito unos 3 meses más para terminarlo como a mí me gustaría, con todas las etapas visuales y zonas que no pude poner en la versión original de MSX.Los gráficos están totalmente rehechos. Los hago en un PC que tiene más de 9 años, con un programa de dibujo que tiene unos 20 años y con un ratón (pixel a pixel!)La programación y los mapeados los hago con el Game Maker.Las músicas las hice con un MSX 2 (un ordenador de 8 bits del 1985).Aún y sin recursos, el juego está quedando bastante bien y el desarrollo avanza muy rápido.Necesitaría un mes y medio más para terminar el juego, pero desearía trabajar en el juego 3 meses más para añadirle todo lo que le deseo añadir y que quede como se merece.Para poder trabajar en el exclusivamente durante 3 meses, necesito recaudar unos 2000 euros para subsistir esos 3 meses (mis hijos y yo podemos pasar cada mes con solo 600 euros).Por eso os pido vuestra ayuda para poder acabar el juego como se merece.Por supuesto, todos los patrocinadores seréis recompensados con un reducido precio de pre-compra y además saldréis en los créditos del juego.También podéis acceder a recompensas exclusivas de ésta campaña (recompensas que no será posible conseguir después de la campaña). En el peor de los casos:Si no logro recaudar 2000 euros en esta campaña, haré otras campañas similares en otras plataformas de mecenazgo localizadas en ciertos países (kickstarter, Verkami…)Si al final solo recaudase (por ejemplo) 1000 euros, terminaría el juego 1 mes y medio (que es el tiempo mínimo que necesito para terminarlo) y el juego ya sería mucho más amplio que la versión original de MSX 2. Help!In addition to any financial contributions, I would like to ask you to send the link of this campaign to as much people as you could: by Twitter, Facebook, Whatsapp ...Creating awareness of this project is as important as the economic support.You can also vote the game in Steam greenlight:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetai...Please take a minute to vote this game.Thank you all for your attention.I hope you like the game! Ayuda!Además de cualquier contribución económica, me gustaría pediros que mandaseis el enlace de esta campaña a cuanta más gente mejor: por Twitter, Facebook, Whatsapp…Crear difusión del proyecto es tan importante como el apoyo económico.Tambien podeis ayudar a que el juego esté en steam:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetai...Dedicadle 1 minuto a votar el proyecto, por favor.Gracias a todos por vuestra atención.Espero que os guste el juego!",10.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>My Journey</h3>
<p>My name is Andrey Balandin, I am a graduate of the New Jersey Institute of Technology with a Bachelors in Digital Design. I currently work for the Financial Times as a Customer Engagement Manager. My passion is video games. </p>
<p>At first I started selling these consoles on eBay and everything was going great. But, unfortunately all great things come to an end. A third party in the US has trademarked the term RetroPie which is the UK software company who made the RetroPie. This person is going on eBay (and maybe other sites) and taking reporting anyone who is selling consoles with the RetroPie system on it with the argument that his name has been stolen. Selling something that explains it has the RetroPie system is fair use by US law but eBay does not have a vetting system where they check these reports. Two times eBay has suspended my account and then apologized for doing so because they understood that I was not infringing on any copyright. Until today, eBay has indefinitely suspended my account and I want to completely get away from them. This goes into my proposal.</p>
<p>Here are some articles below about the ordeal.</p>

<p>$500 - will go to state filing fees and fees to pay a lawyer to do all the paperwork to register my Video Game Business</p>

<p>Players will experience the fast and frantic gameplay of old-school shooters like Doom and Quake, while having opportunities to build their characters and interact with the world in narrative-based games like Deus Ex and Borderlands. Players start with an inventory of 2, and must balance that with the weapons, items, and equipment that they find throughout the game. Every level's exit must be unlocked with a keycard found in a random location in each level, which takes up an inventory slot. Inventory can be expanded by finding bags in-game or by buying upgrades at the shop, located in each level. Every 3 to 5 levels, the player will face off against a boss, which gives powerful loot and 1 ability power, which ranges from sprinting or dashing to stopping bullets and slowing down time. </p>
<p>Interaction with NPCs extends far beyond dialogue. Each friendly NPC found in the game can be rescued and returned to the player's base, their own Utopia. Here, the player can decide between buying upgrades during gameplay or saving the money they collect and buying upgrades for their Utopia at the shop. Every NPC rescued has certain attributes and a chance to grant a buff, modifier, weapon, upgrade, or item to the player before their next run.</p>

The company

The idea came when in 2010 Omar López (founder), drived by his chilhood memories where he played with the arcade machines, and his experience as designer, he came with the idea of creating a single machine with all the 80's and 90's video games, street fighter II, super pang, out-run, final fight, etc., and actual games.
He designed a gaming machine with all the necessary components, with the challenge of not breaking the aesthetic or design of any home. After months of planning and studying it, he has build the first prototype of the Arcade R1, fully operational and functional.
Currently the project is more advanced, and it has the support of a profesional team with the same goal, take those experiences of the arcades room in the 80's and 90's to your home, in an easy and compatible way with the current and retro games.




Video games, such as Pac-Man™, Space Invaders™, Robotron™, Galaga™, Donkey Kong™ and Street Fighter™, were played during decades in the arcades, with machines we all wished to have some day.

Final sale price in stores and On-line

Once the Recrelux is in the stores, the model Arcade R1 will cost US$ 1.499.

We have already finished the prototype of the  Arcade R1  100% functional, and now, our goal with the funds we raise will be:

Produce enough units to supply the establishments in United States, Canada, Spain and Japan.
Create a marketing campaign in different languages focuses on the american, canadian, latin and japanese market.
Invest in media communication such as magazines specialised in video games, internet, television and social media to advertise the product.

 Presents:


Radar Command!  
  




Radar Command is a RTS (Real Time Strategy) game, where the player deploys scouts or drones to determine and reveal unknown threats, and respond to those threats with appropriate force, and within a budget.

You will, through a simplified interface, be challenged by restraint and the ability to conserve resources.





 

 Game Play:



 With budget provided, you will prepare for the first wave by purchasing the weapons of war.  (Drones, scouts, or whatever your budget allows you to complete your mission)
 

 Enemies appear on the radar as red dots, representing a radar signature. Their actual designation can be revealed by deploying drones or scouts where you can engage them or retreat for reinforcements (if you have them.)
   

 As more units arrive, you must defend your base.
   

 At the conclusion of each match, the budget for the next match will be determined by the outcome and the resources you have left at the end of that round.
   
 Your errors, mistakes, and sacrifices will be cumulative. So, the outcome of later encounters will cost you in the end. 










 Mission:

Dancing Panda Studios, LLC will continue to upgrade and develop the game through its final release.

We will be seeking a place on Valve Software’s Steam platform, through the Steam Greenlight launch platform, and will be available for prerelease through crowd funding sites such as IndieGoGo and Kickstarter.

We will be seeking additional funds throughout the development process to get us to our release goals.

With your help we can make a game that’s challenging and fun to play!

<h3>Hello </h3>
<p>Hi, thanks for being here. I'm a Graphic Designer and Illustrator from Northern California. I designed this delectable set of playing cards based on one of my favorite hobbies: cooking!

They have a retro vibe and a fun, bright color palette. <span><br/></span></p>

Hi, thanks for being here. I'm a Graphic Designer and Illustrator from Northern California. I designed this delectable set of playing cards based on one of my favorite hobbies: cooking! The Chef Deck is a full set of 54 standard playing cards. I designed and illustrated the entire deck. The illustrations are inspired by minimal Mid-Century Modern geometric design. They have a retro vibe and a fun, bright color palette. 
The deck is a set of functional playing cards. The standard suits have been replaced by cooking utensils for a fun spin on the traditional deck design. The face cards feature all female chefs.

What I Need
 I had several sample decks printed and have found a quality manufacturer. What I need now is money to produce a larger batch of decks to share and sell. $2000 will help me get a sizable number of decks printed on high-quality linen card stock in their own custom box. Since the samples have been approved, I can order the final decks once I'm funded and have them ready in time for Christmas.
If I don't reach my entire goal, I will still be able to go to print, I'll just create a smaller quantity of decks.



Perks!

There will be some special perks besides the Chef Deck playing cards. These include blank recipe cards for keeping track of your favorite recipes and limited edition prints to beautify your space.



Playing Cards - Standard deck with 54 cards (including Jokers). Printed on Casino quality, thick Linen card stock in their own box. 2.5"" x 3.5"".

Recipe Cards - Double-sided cards. 4"" x 6"". One set = 10 cards.
Print - Two-color limited edition print featuring kitchen utensils based on the card back. Hand-numbered and signed on fine art paper. 5"" x 7"".
Framed Print - Only 5 available. Hand-numbered and signed on fine art paper. Matted to 5"" x 7"", frame size is 9"" x 11"". Dark brown eco frame made of bamboo.


Shipping is free in the USA on everything except the framed prints. Worldwide shipping prices are shown on available items.
















Why Contribute? This project is a unique opportunity for me to share my art and promote myself as a graphic designer and illustrator. It will allow me to share my skills with colleagues, customers, and potential employers.
I love what I do and this will help me share my art with all of you.

   Risks & Challenges The biggest challenge is to just reach my goal. Proofs and samples of the deck have been approved in advance, so once I get my funding I can quickly go to print. I am in communication with the printer and they have ensured me that the decks will make my deadline.
I have experience in shipping and recieving and will not have any issues with the mailing portion of the project. My biggest concern will be getting the perks to everyone in a timely matter, this includes anyone buying for holiday gifts.

</div></div>","Greetings and Welcome!


We are Haphazard Projects, a small-press game design crew with only one weakness: we have no artists! We have still managed to get two game books published (that part we do by ourselves - printing and distribution) and a free fan-work of DC's comics Green Lantern Corps for our in-house rules known as the DPS System, now in its ""2nd Edition"" and available to play via Facebook and G+ Hangouts.


Chronicles of the Orb: Shaedeam's Song is an epic RPG more than 25 years in the making. The whole time, the characters, races, setting details... everything but the mechanics have always been the same. 

The phrase ""Chronicles of the Orb"" is the title the game and ""Shaedeam's Song"" details the setting. There are indeed other ""Songs"" that have been written, but all will use the characters and creatures developed here within.


Shaedeam is a huge planet, more than twice the size of Earth, with more than 300,000 years of fictional history. The game elements are unique and have never before been seen in any novel, comic book, film or video game. Over 120 unique races and four levels of character creation: Adventurer, Explorer, Heroic and Epic. 

The DPS System is specifically designed to be intuitive and interactive. Creating a character takes as long as the player would like. Whether you spend ten minutes or two hours, the character balance remains the same.

We will make the game available for play prior to release so that you can play before you buy! Simply visit us on Facebook and watch out for our hosted game events!   

 

The writing is the easy part, and that is what we do best. The Adventurer Core Set is complete and ready for release.  Shipping costs are included with the Perk Cost.

The other Core Sets are in various stages of development.

Phase One of this project will allow us to start pulling together an art staff and promotional materials.  Three more Phases of development will follow, each including new material to expand the game's optional mechanics and setting and the raised funds will also expand the art and layout of the Core Sets.

If we don't reach the $5000 goal, the money will be going towards promotional items and publicity via popular websites, podcasts and the like. Exposure can only help any further efforts to bring these games to life. Backers will still receive the PDFs and physical copies as per their purchased Perk level.

Our objective is to step up our organizing efforts by creating something both entertaining to watch and of value to the community. We don’t believe the days of StarCraft events are over, so instead of waiting around for someone else to do something, we’ve decided to put to put this together.The PlanThis is happening whether the world wants it or not (though we hope it does), but we wanted to find ways to help improve the event itself.  So, here we have an IndieGoGo campaign to allow the community to help contribute to growing the event.Instead of just donating money we wanted to attach it to rewards and indieGoGo was the best place to do it. Everytime someone contributes it helps make for a better event. How are the Funds Being Used?The original plan was to use the money to fill the bathtub with Jell-o, but we figured the community wouldn’t like that (or would you?). So instead we decided it’s best to use the funds on things that will actually help the event. The PlayersThe TournamentWhy a LAN Qualifer?  Well because it’s a throwback to our TorCraft Series that supported our local Toronto StarCraft scene. We never want to leave that behind, so while we have discontinued TorCraft we wanted to incorporate its spirit into Kings of the North.More details for the tournament can be found on the event site.PerksThe Goals **Special**As part of our goal to put on a good show we’ll be doing a special live episode of SC2CTL Jeopardy! Your host Troy Pavlek will  grill our players and commentators on their StarCraft II knowledge.What if I can’t afford to donate ?There are many ways you can help out that don’t involve money. You could simply share the event, or watch it live on twitch.tv/eschampOr you could always send us a tweet or join our discord channel to tell us about awesome things. These are definitely the best ways to brighten our day.  :)",6.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Many long days and hours went into the creation of the world's largest radio station mod for Fallout New Vegas. Old World Radio - Boston will continue this tradition for Fallout 4 and will have professionally voice-acted content including celebrity voices, lore-friendly audio-drama, lore-friendly commercials and plenty more and will also be a mass improvement compared to the original Old World Radio mod for New Vegas. We want to be able to make this radio station mod actually make people who haven't even previously played the game, want to play just for the incredible voice-acting, story telling and humor that it will bring to Fallout 4. These endorsements will contribute to the furthering of the quality and talent of this massive DLC-like radio station mod for Fallout 4. I want to thank the supporters, the talent and most of all, the support of all fans of Old World Radio and the Fallout video game series.</p><p><br/></p><h3>Risks and challenges</h3><p>One of the biggest challenges is hiring and obtaining paid professional and celebrity voice-actors. We want to be able to pay them for their wonderful talent and have the content of this DLC-like addon be of top-notch quality! So far, we have completed 4 stations that feel like official DLC! We cannot complete a handful of current station projects due to financial reasons. We need to raise money to pay the talent. We also have plans to purchase rights to some incredible copyrighted material to feature in this project but we need your help! Most of us Old World Radio - Boston crew including the mastermind behind it all, are ""average-joe"" factory workers making under $30,000 a year! We are just everyday super-fans of the Fallout lore and Fallout game series that want to make something incredible to contribute to all the fellow fans and creators of this amazing universe we all know and love!</p><br/><p></p><h3>What we have created (and are working on) so far</h3><div>Right now we have 11 stations completed and released and will be creating more soon!</div><div><br/></div><div>RELEASED:</div><div>1. Cadillac Jack's Radio Shack-</div><div>This station is hosted by ""Isaiah Pendergrass"" and plays the best big band and swing old time music.  Isaiah is the brother of ""Moses Pendergrass"" who hosts the brand new Galaxy News Radio in Boston.</div><div><br/></div><div>2. Tumbleweed Tunes-</div><div>This station is hosted by a Sam Elliott sound-a-like named ""Dusty Dude"" and he plays his numberous guitars on the air and tells stories of his days in New Vegas, travelling across country and western words of wisdom.</div><div><br/></div><div>3.

Many long days and hours went into the creation of the world's largest radio station mod for Fallout New Vegas. Old World Radio - Boston will continue this tradition for Fallout 4 and will have professionally voice-acted content including celebrity voices, lore-friendly audio-drama, lore-friendly commercials and plenty more and will also be a mass improvement compared to the original Old World Radio mod for New Vegas. We want to be able to make this radio station mod actually make people who haven't even previously played the game, want to play just for the incredible voice-acting, story telling and humor that it will bring to Fallout 4. These endorsements will contribute to the furthering of the quality and talent of this massive DLC-like radio station mod for Fallout 4. I want to thank the supporters, the talent and most of all, the support of all fans of Old World Radio and the Fallout video game series.Risks and challengesOne of the biggest challenges is hiring and obtaining paid professional and celebrity voice-actors. We want to be able to pay them for their wonderful talent and have the content of this DLC-like addon be of top-notch quality! So far, we have completed 4 stations that feel like official DLC! We cannot complete a handful of current station projects due to financial reasons. We need to raise money to pay the talent. We also have plans to purchase rights to some incredible copyrighted material to feature in this project but we need your help! Most of us Old World Radio - Boston crew including the mastermind behind it all, are ""average-joe"" factory workers making under $30,000 a year! We are just everyday super-fans of the Fallout lore and Fallout game series that want to make something incredible to contribute to all the fellow fans and creators of this amazing universe we all know and love!What we have created (and are working on) so farRight now we have 11 stations completed and released and will be creating more soon!RELEASED:1. Cadillac Jack's Radio Shack-This station is hosted by ""Isaiah Pendergrass"" and plays the best big band and swing old time music.  Isaiah is the brother of ""Moses Pendergrass"" who hosts the brand new Galaxy News Radio in Boston.2. Tumbleweed Tunes-This station is hosted by a Sam Elliott sound-a-like named ""Dusty Dude"" and he plays his numberous guitars on the air and tells stories of his days in New Vegas, travelling across country and western words of wisdom.3.

<p><b>ESCAPAD: <b>Omnidirectional Virtual Reality walking board</b></b></p>
<p>From the moment this
idea came to mind and the conclusion that no-one has thought of this solution
before, it has been a race to make a prototype and present this to you. This
patent pending ESCAPAD is a dream come true. Before this hits retail you will own it and love it. </p>
<p><b>2016 &amp; Virtual
Reality</b></p>
<p>We are all aware that
the next big thing is Virtual Reality. It seems like every major electronics
company is creating its own Virtual Reality headset. From dedicated sets, to
headsets which require the insertion of a smartphone. The consumer is already
able to access VR on a large scale, from relatively basic tech solutions, to
hi-end installations. Especially in 2016 a lot of VR hardware and software is
expected.</p>
<p><b>The Oculus rift/ Samsung gear VR, PlayStation
VR, HTC Vive</b> and also the <b>Google cardboard</b> are already well known and highly
anticipated. Our ultimate goal is to gain support from these companies for full interaction and compatibility
to their headsets.</p>
<p>The immersive
experience relies a lot on movement. Imagination has been put into finding the
best way to walk in Virtual Reality. We have seen other devices of which some
have gained a lot of attention and support. Yet none have reached the dedicated
consumer. This might have to do with the size and the mechanics of these
devices. The consumer would very much like to have something less ostentatious,
ultra-storable and none restraining. This is where the ESCAPAD makes the
difference.</p>
<br/>

<p><b>Not just for gaming</b></p>
<p>Even though gaming is
the first thing that comes to mind when talking about virtual reality. There
are a lot of serious applications that can be improved by this peripheral. Real
estate agents will use the Escapad to give clients a walking tour through a
virtual house that is for sale. Interior decorators, contractors, architects
and more can now present their ideas in a more immersive way. </p>
<p>Sports coaches can
use this to explain a strategy to the team. If it is too rainy outside to jog,
you can go jogging on the Escapad with or without a VR headset.</p>
<p>Being able to walk
around can be useful to reconstruct situations like reenactments of a crime
scene. The Escapad can also serve as a tool for several therapies.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b><span>Size</span></b></p>
<p>It is roughly the
size of a small skateboard, with two sliding and turning plateaus for your feet.
This portable gadget enables you to make a walking movement, turn 360 degrees
at will, strafe as in FPS, make a kicking move and all while staying in
place. </p>
<p>Best of all, you can
just step on it. Shoes or without shoes. It doesn’t matter how big or small you
are because opposed to other popular devices, there is no harness involved.
Where other devices claim to be without loud noise, the ESCAPAD wins in
quietness due to the fact the board hardly touches the floor when walking.</p>

<br/>
<p></p>
<p><b>Less fatigue</b></p>
<p>We know you have
watched the other devices and wondered how long it would take for you to get
tired on those. The ESCAPAD does not require you to walk in a manner that
creates friction. It is simply the wobble you naturally make when walking, and
the natural placing of your foot that creates the movement that translates into
the virtual environment.  </p>
<p>We want you to have
this. Imagine just using a smartphone inserted into a google cardboard for
example and playing a game that connects to the ESCAPAD by Bluetooth!</p>
<p><b>What's in it/how does
it work?</b></p>
<p>(Without going into
the patent pending mechanics:)As with most VR Treadmills, this is not
motorized. Your feet move the plateaus, the optical/motion sensors in the
plateaus make sure the motion detection is direct and reliable. The position of
the board determines which way the movement is directed to, also by use of
optical/motion sensors. Vibration units in the board will complete the
experience. We are working with software developers to make sure the movement
of each step is translated into the gaming experience. The reactions on
the prototype so far have been enthusiastic.  </p>
<p>This device is super
portable and can be placed anywhere without taking up a lot of space. </p>
<p><b>Environmental</b></p>
<p>If we expect our product to be a success, we must also take into account the environmental impact of
manufacturing the Escapad. From the start we have and will explore the friendliest
options. Keep an open mind and have quality and Safety aligned to be able to guarantee durability. Furthermore,
the Escapad will require the same connectivity and energy supplies as your game
controller.</p>
<p><b>Unpacking</b></p>
<p>We want you to have
this. Experience the unpacking. Become one of the founders of a future we have
all been longing for. Amaze your friends and let them join in the experience.
Soon you will all have your device with you in the same place, or online.
Playing the latest FPS, walking, running or crouching, wow!</p>

</div>
<div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Bad Taste is a loving send up, and homage of trash cinema, and exploitation films. The story revolves around a jaded police officer ""Chet"" (Spencer Rice), as he tries to escape the city of Victoria BC before it's nuked to eradicate a mutant zombie epidemic caused by genetically modified fast food. The game obviously taking it's title and some inspiration from the Peter Jackson film of the same name. </span></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div>
<b>Game Features: </b><br/>- 20 levels of insane zombie action. (17 at launch, 3 as free DLC)<br/>- Levels with secrets, and multiple paths. <br/>- 5 different intense bosses to fight against. <br/>- 40+ monsters to battle. (Unique monsters, not color swaps)<br/>- Several different weapons, and items to unlock. <br/>- Fully animated cinematics. <br/>- Beautifully grotesque 2D backgrounds, inspired by real locations in Victoria BC. <br/>- Voice acting by Spenny, Kenny, and additional special guest Lloyd Kaufman. <br/>- Soundtrack by the Finnish Band ""Lodger""! <br/><b style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></b>
</div>
<div>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">Gameplay:</b><br/>
</div>
<div>Gameplay is centered around ""restricted combat"", as each level will only allow the player to select 1 firearm, 1 melee, and 1 item to assist them through the stage from the pool of weapons/items the player has already unlocked. Certain firearms make noise, and will attract more zombies if shot, and some items are better suited to fighting some enemies than others, so the player will need to decide how to approach each level to maximize their score. <br/><br/>*In the future, the game will be expanded to include additional character campaigns, as well as random enemy encounters, more weapons, and surviors to rescue, plus Co-op. </div>

<b style=""background-color: initial;"">What We Need:</b><br/>
</div>
<div>Bad taste is a game that has been in production for over 2 years, the game was financed thus far entirely from my own private funds, and much progress has been made. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>T<span style=""background-color: initial;"">he engine has been built, the voice acting is completed, 80% of the art is finished, and the game is already past the steam greenlight process.</span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">During this time the project has grown in size and scope, it's a more ambitious project than what we originally had intended, more enemies were added, all the cinematics are now fully animated, and more secret area's were designed.</span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">The main issue now is turning all this additional art into spritesheets, and programming the new enemy behaviours, this is a time consuming process, and we need at least $20000.00 in additional funding to pay the artist and programmer so they can work full time on this to have it ready by the years end. </span><br/>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div>This is my first fundraising campaign, and I ask for this money to keep the game raw and raunchy, and to provide a product that isn't compromised in order to make a quick dollar.</div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>Perks:</b></div>
<div>There are several perks available, the base perk is you can pre-order the game for $9.99 that's discounted from the $14.99 retail price the game will be sold at, plus you can play an early build (the first 5 levels), at the end of the campaign.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We also have posters, and a couple of opportunities to include you in the game as a zombie/mutant enemy, so you can get killed (or kill) Spenny. </div>

<p>However the game is now grounded in terms of it's vision, and what needs to be completed, we simply need the resources to get this done, the more we get the more time each staff member can spend on their respective tasks, and the sooner this project will be released.</p>
<p>Everyone involved in the game is 10 fingers and ten toes involved, if we fail to meet our goal, it would set us back, but we would find some way to eventually complete the project. </p>
<p>We want to obtain funding so we don't need to remove any of the content, and keep this game independent and adult oriented. </p>
<p>Additionally failure to complete funding would hurt the chances of a future DLC starring Kenny Hotz as a playable character.</p>

Story:


Bad Taste is a loving send up, and homage of trash cinema, and exploitation films. The story revolves around a jaded police officer ""Chet"" (Spencer Rice), as he tries to escape the city of Victoria BC before it's nuked to eradicate a mutant zombie epidemic caused by genetically modified fast food. The game obviously taking it's title and some inspiration from the Peter Jackson film of the same name. 


Game Features: - 20 levels of insane zombie action. (17 at launch, 3 as free DLC)- Levels with secrets, and multiple paths. - 5 different intense bosses to fight against. - 40+ monsters to battle. (Unique monsters, not color swaps)- Several different weapons, and items to unlock. - Fully animated cinematics. - Beautifully grotesque 2D backgrounds, inspired by real locations in Victoria BC. - Voice acting by Spenny, Kenny, and additional special guest Lloyd Kaufman. - Soundtrack by the Finnish Band ""Lodger""! 


Gameplay:

Gameplay is centered around ""restricted combat"", as each level will only allow the player to select 1 firearm, 1 melee, and 1 item to assist them through the stage from the pool of weapons/items the player has already unlocked. Certain firearms make noise, and will attract more zombies if shot, and some items are better suited to fighting some enemies than others, so the player will need to decide how to approach each level to maximize their score. *In the future, the game will be expanded to include additional character campaigns, as well as random enemy encounters, more weapons, and surviors to rescue, plus Co-op. 








What We Need:

Bad taste is a game that has been in production for over 2 years, the game was financed thus far entirely from my own private funds, and much progress has been made. 

The engine has been built, the voice acting is completed, 80% of the art is finished, and the game is already past the steam greenlight process.


During this time the project has grown in size and scope, it's a more ambitious project than what we originally had intended, more enemies were added, all the cinematics are now fully animated, and more secret area's were designed.


The main issue now is turning all this additional art into spritesheets, and programming the new enemy behaviours, this is a time consuming process, and we need at least $20000.00 in additional funding to pay the artist and programmer so they can work full time on this to have it ready by the years end. 


This is my first fundraising campaign, and I ask for this money to keep the game raw and raunchy, and to provide a product that isn't compromised in order to make a quick dollar.

Perks:
There are several perks available, the base perk is you can pre-order the game for $9.99 that's discounted from the $14.99 retail price the game will be sold at, plus you can play an early build (the first 5 levels), at the end of the campaign.

We also have posters, and a couple of opportunities to include you in the game as a zombie/mutant enemy, so you can get killed (or kill) Spenny.

<h2>Thank you for supporting The Gaming Place Manchester</h2></div>","What is it?
The Gaming Place Manchester is the idea of one man. The aim to create a venue in the heart of Manchester (UK)'s City Centre, where people can come and play some awesome games; Everything from the latest blockbusters, to modern classics. We are planning on getting retro games from the likes of SNES, MegaDrive and even old school Atari, and arcade machines.
There will even be a lounge area for you to bring your handheld consoles so you can compete, help and share ideas with fellow gamers.
We will hold tournaments, competions and will host special events too.

You can help!
Every donation will help us to become a reality. All the funds we raise will go towards the equipment we need; from the consoles, games and TVs, to IT systems and security devices.
Check out the perks for some exclusive deals with regards to memberships, should we reach our goal. You can save upto 50% off the planned membership prices.
Membership details are still being fully finalised, but these perks will be honoured should we reach our goal.

What challenges will you face?
We know this is going to be a challenge, but with the help of the community (along with other funding) we can make this become a reality.
Security is going to be one of the biggest things to tackle. Not only to protect all of the expensive equipment at all times, but also for visitors. We will constantly be working to help protect everyone, not just those on site, but anyone who visits. CCTV will be in operation within the venue for your safety, and all your personal data will also be covered under the Data Protection Act.

How else can I help?
If you can't donate, then don't worry. Come and show your support by liking us on Facebook and following us on Twitter. You can also take a quick survey which will help shape the way we operate. This is completely anonymous unless you choose to request us to contact you.
If you wish to contact us, you can send an email to: funding@thegamingplacemanchester.co.uk

What happens if you don't meet your funding target?
Of course we would love to reach our goal, but we fully understand that we may not. We are still looking at alternative means of funding such as loans and grants to help out.
""So why are you asking for donations?"" I hear you ask, well this is simple. It is so that we can get going as quickly as possible. It also means that we have less ongoing expenses, meaning more money to invest in the latest gaming goodness, and lower membership fees for visitors.

 The Impact


Only one source code to get Real-Time Multiplayer with users on Android and iOS devices, all this powered by Adobe AIR and Google Play Game Services.

  Risks & Challenges  
Today, we have completed the code to create Real-Time Multiplayer sessions for Android devices (see video) and we have already begun with the part to add iOS devices to Multiplayer sessions with very good results. In our view the Real-Time Multiplayer is the most complicated and we are sure that once this part is completed, the others will be much easier. Why not to sell the ANE after the campaign will be over?This component will be built to use ourselves in our developments, but to absorb the costs, we decided to launch this campaign in indiegogo. Sell this component involves having a virtual store and maintain it, that is something that we are not interested at this time. Then brings to the campaign now to get the ANE.

<p>A traditional drink, it takes about 20 minutes before nearly
all the booze reaches your small intestines, the liver and followed by the
pancreas. In this period, it’s possible the ultimate impacts of the drink won't
have shown yet, getting the person to believe he or she may continue to consume
more booze. Often times many people will have multiple drinks throughout the
night (stacking drinks), meaning shot after shot or drink after drink. At this
time, they will have over consumed and will not understand the absolute effects
until it is too late. The worse part of all this, is it will take hours for the
liquor to break down, allowing you to feel normal and sober again.</p>
<p>When consumed as vapor, non-alcoholic* drinks bypass the body’s
digestive system and is absorbed directly into the bloodstream, passing through
the lungs briefly before moving quickly onto the brain. Because it circulates
freely and is not subject to dilution, inhaled non-alcoholic* liquid fumes are able to
deliver their mind-altering kick immediately, leaving the user feeling
instantly intoxicated for 30 to 40 minutes. There is no hangover once the
initial buzz wears off.</p>

<h1>Why Indiegogo</h1>
<p>We would like to manufacture a complete line of these
devices as well as devices that are built to customer specifications.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>Our biggest financial hurdle is the creation of the molds, each one 
will set us back a few thousand dollars. Every other part is sourced 
from various suppliers from around the globe. During our research we 
found that many overseas companies have a tendency of making products 
that are lacking in quality. To prevent that, all the units will be 
assembled in Canada in our facility. Our goal is to keep our budget as 
lean as possible and to scale the business onwards.</p>
<p>All projects have their fare share of risks. That being said we have 
taken every precaution to minimize them. First the product will be 
assembled locally so that we have full control over quality control. 
Second we used parts that were designed to be as simple as possible, but
 having safety as our number one priority. Third we have sourced all of 
the necessary parts and equipment that will be needed to complete the 
project.</p>
<p>We have already met and signed all the necessary agreements with all of our suppliers and manufacturers.</p>

 Smell is the main determining factor of an item’s taste and
since the non-alcoholic* liquid vapor is airborne, you get a much richer taste sensation. This
allows connoisseur’s to enjoy their non-alcoholic* drink on another level, one that has not
been experienced before


FASTER BUZZ

The feeling of being buzzed happens much faster and the
non-alcoholic* drink hits your blood stream without having to get processed by the other
organs


NO HANGOVERS

 In our “testing” all the participants that normally would
have hangovers the following day, felt much better and in most cases had felt
none of the symptoms


DETOX QUICKER

 The feeling of being buzzed happens much faster and the
non-alcoholic* liquid hits your blood stream without having to be processed by the other
organs


CHEAP BUZZ

Due to the by-passing the organs that normal drinking would
have to go through, a lot less non-alcoholic* liquid is needed to have a good time


DON’T LOSE YOUR LUNCH

 Soon as your body recognizes that it has had too much, it
wants to purge. Since there is no liquor, additives and sugars in your stomach,
the urge to puke is minimal


TimeLine



End
of January 2015 – Funding process
February
– Have molds created/tested and order the remaining parts
March
through May – Production starts
June
through July – The first batch of the Drank Tanks are shipped out
August
– Everyone will have received their Drank Tank’s by this time
*I’d like
start off by saying this is an very educated timeline, unforeseen issues may
push the dead line back but please note this is the plan. The Drank Tank Team
has put their heart and soul into this product. We will do everything in our
power to get the product on time, if not before schedule. 
Why Indiegogo
We would like to manufacture a complete line of these
devices as well as devices that are built to customer specifications.

Risks and challenges
Our biggest financial hurdle is the creation of the molds, each one 
will set us back a few thousand dollars. Every other part is sourced 
from various suppliers from around the globe. During our research we 
found that many overseas companies have a tendency of making products 
that are lacking in quality. To prevent that, all the units will be 
assembled in Canada in our facility. Our goal is to keep our budget as 
lean as possible and to scale the business onwards.
All projects have their fare share of risks. That being said we have 
taken every precaution to minimize them. First the product will be 
assembled locally so that we have full control over quality control. 
Second we used parts that were designed to be as simple as possible, but
 having safety as our number one priority. Third we have sourced all of 
the necessary parts and equipment that will be needed to complete the 
project.
We have already met and signed all the necessary agreements with all of our suppliers and manufacturers.",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

Furthermore, you will never receive the same items which you already have from a chest.

Empowering REAL donations through FREE games
 
""Games have a major impact on all aspects of life and that's how the idea for this project was born"" - Artur Grigorjan, Co-founder at Cooltivate

 

 
To use games as a foundation for building an ecosystem, where people can help the planet while enjoying a game sounded like a great idea. With this campaign my team and I are aiming to achieve what others have never thought of before - to use games in a value exchange model that will help clear the world of pollution. 
How does that work? You play a game and collect points, each of them will convert to real money that you will be able to send to environmental protection organisations of your choice.

 

 
It's a shame to see how irresponsible some people may be in the real world, when they litter, over-consume and simply neglect the environment in which they live. This has to change!
Our Planet is in danger! We overproduce mass goods. Surely that improved the quality of our lives, but there is a price to pay. Handling waste irresponsibly lead to environmental crisis across the globe and we need to act quick! 

Marine debris injures and kills marine life, interferes with navigation safety, and poses a threat to human health.

Pollution can affect the food we eat. Heavy metals and other contaminants can accumulate in seafood and make it harmful to eat. More than one-third of the shellfish-growing waters of the United States are adversely affected by coastal pollution.

Hundreds of thousands of sea turtles, whales, and other marine mammals, and more than 1 million seabirds die each year from ocean pollution and ingestion or entanglement in marine debris.

 

The games will feature all known topics, which require attention and help. Ranging from fighting ocean pollution up till protecting animals and preventing deforestation. All of this aspect are embedded into fun and challenging game mechanics to engage people while playing and give them tools to help, while they enjoy a great gaming experience.

Cooltivate platform works with reliable charities only. Companies that are making a change. This will include the following:

 
















 
Try the game here if you haven't already!

 

 

By creating this charity platform for games we invest your time (which becomes real money) into supporting NGOs that are trying to save the Planet and protect our unified home against pollution. Separately we won't make much of a difference, but together, if we unite, we are able to make a change! And what better way to do it, if you have some fun along the way, when you play great games.


 

 
We can STOP this once and for all, if we act now! We need your help to support our project and enable the use of our platform to raise awareness and support charities with fighting these problems in real life.
FUNDING:
We are raising money to fund two aspects of this project:

Development and testing - Building Games and the Charity platform ($80k)
Marketing and PR - Spreading the word and investing into paid advertising ($120k)

We have already published our first game Ocean Care on Google Play! 
 
Download for your android device!

 


Every person that contributes at least $5 will become legacy and end up in the Hall of Fame section on our Official Website. The world will know it's heroes once this project gets some traction and we will make it a great success together with your help!

More perks than ever before! Show more love for this project and show off in front of friends and family, that you have what it takes to rescue our planet from this horrible tragedy, that it is facing.
Show people that  you care by supporting our project with the Admirer Pack, that includes a branded T-shirt. Choose a color that best represents you:

For over 10 million children kidnapped across the world, slavery could not be more real.

<h4>So the big question: Why are we bringing this game to IndieGoGo and
 asking for money? We have been self-funding the game for awhile, but the
 scope of the game has grown beyond what we can afford. We've gone as far 
as we can with our own money (which was actually pretty far) and need 
just a bit more to guarantee a quality game. </h4>
<p>The
 main areas we need the additional funding for are multiplayer and 
character animation. Naturally, the most talented contractors cost more.
 Every cent of money contributed will be going towards speeding up 
development and making the game look and play better. <br/></p>
<p>Here's a brief list of how successful funding would allow us to improve the game:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Top quality animation</b> - We have a couple of awesomely talented 
animators from the Bioshock Infinite team that would like to help out. 
We need more money to pay them. </li>
<li>
<b>More platforms</b> - In addition to PC/PS4/Vita/WiiU, we also want to
 bring the game to Xbox One, Mac, Linux, and mobile. Additional funding 
makes that possible.</li>
<li>
<b>More levels</b> - More levels to play with new monsters!</li>
<li>
<b>Local and Online Multiplayer</b>- Compete for shards with other 
players in arenas filled with monsters. Find power ups to become a 
monster or create traps to kill off the competition. Who will survive?</li>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>As with all games, there is the risk that problems could arise at any
 point during the final stretch of development. These problems could 
involve technical issues, earthquakes, sudden untimely/horrifying death, etc. 
Such problems, should they occur, could delay the release of Dark 
Deception. </p>
<p>In all seriousness, rest assured, we will never abandon Dark 
Deception or leave it in an unfinished state. We have been working on 
this game for a year. We have put too much of our time, sweat, 
and passion into the project. We've also put a lot of our own money to 
prove our dedication to seeing this game through. 
Thanks to our previous experience in the industry, we know how to stay 
focused, hit our milestones, and not waste a lot of time in iterative 
loops that do not make the game better. This is not our first rodeo and 
if you trust us with your hard earned cash, we WILL deliver.</p>
<p>With your help we can make Dark Deception the best it can be and deliver a truly intense and terrifying VR horror game!</p>
<ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Help us spread the word! We are a small indie team, so we don't have any spare money to market this campaign. Only with your help can we make this campaign a success. Help us get the support of horror game fans around the world :)!<br/>

</div> <div> <h3>What Shady Stuff Will You Be Doing With My Cash?<br/>
</h3>
<p>Are you sick of indie developers selling Alpha releases?  Me too!  Let's end that now by contributing to my campaign so that I can move on to selling the beta version.  Every contribution will spent on one of the following total downers :(<br/></p> <ul> <li>
<b>Unity PRO</b> which costs $75.00 USD a month.  9 more months of payments to go, that means $500 doesn't even cover my remaining Unity PRO monthly costs.  </li>
<li>
<b>Console Dev Kits - </b>I can't disclose how much they cost (NDA) but they're not cheap.  Any help towards purchasing a console devkit is much appreciated, and $500 doesn't come close to getting one, but everything helps.<b><br/>
</b>
</li> <li>
<b>Really awesome middleware</b>.  There's about $2000 worth of middleware that I would love, so yeah $500 again doesn't even cover the middleware costs.  I'm not going to post a big list here, but message me if you want some specific examples of the middleware I'd like to buy for Arcana Kira.</li>
<li>
<b>VR Support.</b>  There's a few headsets out there, and I'd like to support at least the VIVE VR and Oculus Rift if possible in 2016.  The costs of developing for VR are higher than typical due to the equipment costs, so it goes without saying that once again $500 doesn't cover it.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Website &amp; Marketing expenses</b> (Please refer to Bill Hick's quote regarding Marketing)</li>
<li>
<b>Food</b>. An upgrade to the Pizza and Coffee diet (right now it's Ramen and Tea diet)<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Rent</b>.  You've probably never heard of it, but I've fallen victim to an obscure scam whereby I have to keep paying a bunch of money each month just to not be homeless.  I heard a rumor that it's hard to develop games when you're homeless.<br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> Arcana Kira is coming whether you like it or not.  Whether you support it or not.  That's not to say that I don't need your help, because I definitely do.  I need your feedback, your scathing criticisms, your unreserved judgement on what you feel would improve this game.  Financially, I need your assistance to take Arcana Kira to the next level, although I've designed the game so even if the campaign ends at $0, Arcana Kira is still coming to Steam and to select home consoles as originally intended.  With your support the game will still come to the same platforms, but it will get there with more polish, more content, more eye candy, and maybe even arrive a hair sooner.  <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>This Pitch Scared Me, Where Can I Get Help?</h3>
<p>Yeah, I was a bit silly with this pitch, but I'm dead serious about shipping a fun game at the end of this development process.  If I haven't got you on board right now, don't write this game off so quickly.  I update the game each Friday, so follow this game's IndieGoGo and check back as I update to see if I manage to impress you later with the updates.<br/></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>If you don't have a $1 to spare I understand (no, I really do) but at the same time, if you would please take a second and share this IndieGoGo campaign on Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, or where ever else you post, I would greatly appreciate it.  Thank you!<br/>

<br/>Arcana Kirā utilizes multi-threading, requires DirectX11, and requires a 64-bit version of Windows.  
<br/>
<br/><h2><b>Play Arcana Kira Now!</b></h2> 
Arcana Kira is in public testing now, and is <b>scheduled for retail release on November 2, 2015</b>, at the retail price of $14.99 USD.  
<br/>
<br/>However, if you pre-order Arcana Kira now you can <b>get it for only $4 USD</b>, that's over a 66% savings, and <b><i>you can immediately download and play the current testing version of Arcana Kira!</i></b>
<br/>
<br/><h2>Alpha &amp; Beta Release Schedule</h2>
Arcana Kira comes out in November, but you can play pre-release testing 
versions now.  The initial alpha testing releases are not fully feature 
complete, however that is to force active testing on the areas that are 
near complete.  For example, the game launcher is near feature complete,
 and it needs to be tested by as many users as possible.  In order to 
perfect the game launcher, the ability to change settings inside of the 
game is not yet implemented, forcing you to use the launcher only for 
configuration.  Once the game launcher is solidified, then in-game 
setting changes will be implemented, and then released into the current 
beta.  The in game settings will share much code from the launcher, 
meaning it shouldn’t require the same level of testing, since it is 
based heavily on already tested code.
<br/>
<br/><h2>Regular Releases: New Update Every Friday</h2>
Some indie games sit in early access or beta forever, and unfortunately 
some never make it out of this phase.  Arcana Kira on the other hand, 
has a proactive design spec and which allows for up to 1 year of testing
 before going gold.  This should be more than enough time.  In fact, I 
think Arcana Kira only needs 3 months of beta testing.  Following my 
rule to double all time estimates when it comes to development, I 
therefore posit Arcana Kira will most likely exit beta before 6 months 
have passed from the initial beta release.  However, just to be safe, 
the official testing period is 1 year, from April 2015 to April 2016.  So I
 believe Arcana Kira will be out of beta in 3 months, but I’m giving the
 game at maximum 12 months in beta.  Expect 12 months, although it 
shouldn’t take more than 6, and I’m still shooting for 3 months or less.
<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435187516/ixwmqvdbajdukv9bda3b.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>After the beta period ends I will be supporting Arcana Kira for at least an additional year.  Here are the details:
<br/><ul>
<li>I will attempt to fix any additional bugs or exploits that are discovered after beta.
</li>
<li>I may or may not port Arcana Kira to other platforms and consoles.
</li>
<li>I will implement performance enhancements or update the
 underlying game engine if it’s feasible without breaking stuff or 
adding too high of a development burden.
</li>
<li>I may or may not add other content (for free) such as 
additional enemies, quests, items, expansions, but currently there are 
NO PLANS for any additional content.  This is just not off the table at 
this point, but it’s also not part of the roadmap.
</li>
<li>If the beta finishes earlier than April 2016, then the 
additional time is added the 1 year of post release support.  For 
example, if Arcana Kira exited beta and launched as a retail game in 
July 2015, then 9 months would be added to the post-release support 
period, for a total of 21 months of post release support.
</li>
<li>So regardless of everything, the end date of support 
for Arcana Kira is May 1st, 2017.  After this period, I may still issue 
updates for the game, but nothing is promised. 
</li>
</ul>
<br/>So to quickly recap the above:
<br/><ul>
<li>3 months to 1 year of beta testing
</li>
<li>After beta testing ends, and the retail version is released, an additional year of full support for Arcana Kira
</li>
<li>End date of Arcana Kira support is May 1st, 2017.

<h2>About the game</h2>
<p>First of all I'd like to tell you about the basic concept of the game. In Arcanix you can't rely on weapons or martial arts but solely on magic. Spells can be learned and upgraded through a spell tree that resets in every match. There are several different gamemodes but in most of the cases, you are able to spend points on the spells every time you die which makes the game more balanced. The longer you are alive the harder it gets since the other players will be able to upgrade their arsenal of spells. Some of the gamemodes such as <b>Team deathmatch</b>, <b>Capture the point, </b> <b>King of the hill, GunGame </b>are well known but we intend to introduce unique and fun based ones. </p>
<p>We tried to make the spells interact with each other and the world as much as possible.<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Projectiles collide with each other and dynamic objects like the rock shield</li>
<li>Projectiles are also affected by gravitational fields and wind based spells.</li>
<li>Through these interactions spells can create fearful combos.</li>
</ul>

</div><div>I would like to share some information about the development because I feel it is important to clarify a couple of things.

We used Blender, Gimp, Krita, Audacity to make the assets.

If you sign up for alpha, you can have your app in hand at that date. We aim for the public launch January 2017.</p><p><strong>3:  What do you mean by ‘short-form’ mindfulness training?</strong></p><p>Long-form mindfulness practice from the Buddhist tradition is based on a minimum of 15 minutes of silent unmoving meditation, preferably twice a day. Short-form meditation requires less than 2 minutes at a time but uses very similar techniques, with parallel results.</p><p><strong>4:  Why is breath awareness so important to this program?</strong></p><p>When we’re lost in thoughts of the future or remembrances of the past, we lose awareness of our present-moment breathing and wholebody presence – we’re basically ‘not here’ at all.

We thank you for pledging and supporting our world-community cause. Please go to the top of this site and pledge whatever amount fits your budget - we look forward to exploring how we might work together to help raise consciousness and bring people together in sustainable cooperation.</p><p> </p></div>","WHAT MOODSHIFTING DOES FOR YOUWe all slip regularly into moods that drag us down. The MOODSHIFTER App will help you advance quickly out of negative thoughts and feelings into a more enjoyable and productive mindset. Wherever you are and whatever you're doing, our program is your coach in your pocket, offering uplifting guidance and valued relief. Most stress is caused by time pressure and habitual worrying. The MOODSHIFTER App teaches you a new way to quiet upsetting thoughts, let go of old stress habits, and focus on experiences that make you feel better. WizeWell fully appreciates the value of traditional long-form meditation practice. However, most people don’t have the time or discipline to devote 15-30 minutes a day to long-form meditation. To resolve this dilemma, WizeWell has developed pleasurable game-based adventures that  progressively strengthen your mindfulness muscle. Gaining control of your emotions means consciously focusing away from gloomy thoughts toward positive present-moment experience. Whenever you feel frustrated, anxious or depressed, our app provides professional guidance and support to help you regain inner balance and peace of mind. HOW THE MOODSHIFTER WORKSBased on new research in cognitive psychology, the MOODSHIFTER App offers a compressed, short-form process to consciously break free from old habits, and reactive emotions. WizeWell encourages this moodshifting through animated excursions, visual images, audio guidance, cognitive cues, and video inspiration. Breather BallIf you consciously relax and deepen your breathing, you actively uplift your spirit. Our patent-pending Breather Ball helps you tap your body’s natural ability to balance and relax your inhales and exhales. Each time you use the MOODSHIFTER App you adjust the Breather Ball to match your own breathing. The Breather Ball then provides a visual model for improving your breathing habits. WizeWell GameMany people enjoy the game-dynamics of expectation, challenge, achievement and reward. So why not put mood management and mindfulness training within a game context – why not make self-advancement fun? We’re in the process of developing an ever-expanding set of mini games and challenges that enable you to strengthen your various mindfulness skills as you complete one level after another.NatureWhat can you do in just ten seconds to shift your mood in uplifting directions? Psychological studies prove that just glancing out a window or at a photo onto a nature scene will instantly boost your mood and relax your body. Relief is literally just a touch away – we have over a thousand unique nature visuals which can also be enjoyed as a slide-show. Emotional First AidWhenever you feel overwhelmed, frustrated or depressed, our app provides professional video guidance to shift your attention away from worry and conflict, toward inner balance, acceptance, and recovery. There are eight different 3-minute programs to choose from, depending on your current need. InspireFor thousands of years, human beings have been exploring the power of elicitor phrases and stimulus statements to evoke an associative flow that awakens insight. Our founder John Selby has developed a new set of uplift sayings and insight queries that in just seconds, stimulate a flow of insight and inspiration. Audio Vacation Soothing audio guidance of a particular type can help quiet your mind, calm your emotions, and awaken wholebody relaxation and recharging. Every time you have just half a minute free, you can pause and enjoy one of 50 WizeWell Mini-Vacations. Master ClassWhen you have a couple minutes free, you can explore a master class with John Selby. We offer 30 short videos for step by step mastering mindfulness. Each class has its own Focus Phrase for you to integrate into your daily routine, reminding you of a particular aspect of the mindfulness experience.  OUR HISTORYWizeWell has spent the last decade researching game-based tech tools that transform mindfulness mastery into challenge, anticipation, advancement, victory and pay-off.Teaming with mindfulness-pioneer and psychologist John Selby and his collection of mindfulness-training programs, WizeWell first developed short-form mindfulness programs with Microsoft and Plantronics.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=530659232"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Checkout Divergence: Online on Steam Greenlight!</a></h3><div><br/></div><h3>ANNOUNCED: PVP-Optional Server To Be Included!</h3><p style=""text-align: center;"">
</p><p>We've had so many articles come out wherein hundreds, if not thousands, of 
people make mention in some form that they ""would contribute if it weren't for 
the open-pvp"", that we've completely re-evaluated the situation and decided to include a second ""consentual-pvp"" server based on ""TEF"" regardless of the game's funding status, and not as a stretch goal :)</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> Players on the new server can either 
spend their days harvesting, crafting, dancing, playing as non-combatants, or 
flag themselves for PVP with a ""TEF"" and engage in an afternoon of RvR 
fun.</span><br/></p>
<h4><i>What's a TEF?</i></h4>
<p>A ""TEF"" or ""Temporary Enemy Flag"" occurs either intentionally, by flagging 
yourself via chat command, or by performing certain actions. A few of those 
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Healing or buffing factionally-combative players in a state of PVP.</li>
<li>Killing or harming faction NPCs, such as town guards of an opposing 
faction.</li>
<li>Being forcefully ejected from a player city or establishment where you are 
unwelcome.</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, if you're playing just to craft, harvest, dance, or even if 
you're healing or aiding other players (so long as they are not recently engaged 
in PVP), you can no longer be harmed, debuffed, or otherwise negatively affected 
by other players.</p>
<h4><i>Won't this require your current game code to be 
changed, and how soon would this be available?</i></h4>
<p>Running a secondary ""PVP-Optional"" server will not require significant 
changes to combat, since that's already the focus of our IndieGoGo, there is 
none! It will simply require more resources to be directed at developing the 
aforementioned ""TEF"" system. This is something we're more than prepared to do 
for the players, so long as we don't have to detract money from the overall 
development of the game to do it. Therefore, what we decided to do was add a 
brand new stretch goal to invite the players to make it possible for us to 
develop this ""optional PVP"".</p>
<p>What we hope this'll do, is give all those people who write us and say ""I'd 
contribute but... Open PVP"" a way of putting their money where their mouth is. 
while simultaneously funding both the game itself, and the style of gameplay 
they prefer. We could bring it online even before our Steam release for 
testing.</p>
<h4><i>Will there be any 
other differences between the Primary server and the secondary ""PVP-Optional"" 
server?</i></h4>
<p>There will be a few minor differences between the two geared mainly to 
gently nudge people towards our primary server, such as story events, and GMs 
playing notable NPCs and faction leaders on the primary server, but as far as 
game mechanics and features are concerned, they both get the same content. 
Additionally, we're experimenting with the idea of allowing characters to 
transfer between servers if they meet certain stipulations and even keep their 
character names, so long as it can be done in a manner that neither rewards nor 
penalizes the practice.</p>
<h4>What if people contribute specifically to make the 
PVP-Optional server happen, but then it doesn't meet that stretch 
goal?</h4>
<p>In that case, depending on how close it comes to the goal, we'll either 
elect to do the PVP-Optional server regardless of that fact, or we'll offer 
refunds to those people. Basically in either scenario, you can't lose :)</p>
<p>Thanks again for all your support guys, and let’s make this damn game 
happen!</p><h3>

</h3><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The Setting:</span><br/>
</h3><div>
<div>It's the year 2330, Earth Standard Date.<p></p>
<p>If you're a Terran Human, Synthetic, Veli Vindicator, or Lokri, you're a momentary survivor of a massive crash-landing event wherein your capitalship was inexplicably  and violently ripped from its orbit down to the surface of this alien moon.</p>
<p>You don't know why. Nobody knows why at this moment, but you suspect your enemies, one of the other factions your ship was locked in a Mexican standoff with only hours before, had something to do with it.</p>
<p>Somehow, you were pulled down to this alien, yet familiar planetoid, orbiting a super-earth.</p>
<p>Chaos. Bodies burning. Conduits belching violent current into twisted forms of broken super-structure, as your fellow shipmates desperately labor under yawning bulkheads to free trapped humans, aliens, and machines.</p>
<p>And all the while, the endless chattering in the dark just beyond the threshold of your perception.</p>
<p>Eyes, watching you. Two. Ten. A hundred. A thousand. My God, my science, they're everywhere! It's an attack!!!</p>
<p>The native creatures. Other survivors from the other ships. They're all equally dangerous; Your only hope being the frantic and desperate repair and re-establishment of make-shift cloning facilities at your base-camp immediately adjacent the smoldering ruin of your once pristine starship; Now buried face-first in a landscape hideously scarred by your arrival.</p>
<p>You Must Survive</p>
<p>Find your friends. Know where your enemies are. Venture out to establish outposts of your own but not too far, lest you be fell upon by the world's native inhabitants, agents of enemy factions, mercenaries, assassins, bandits, or even the conditions of the environment itself.</p>
</div>
</div><h3>Superior Resource Surveying and Harvesting</h3><div>Resource locations, concentrations, and individuals stats appear and disappear as they're used up all over the world's surface. Some will last mere hours, some, potentially months, so use your surveying tools to find the best resource locations and stake your claim before other players do!</div><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442130137/kq7j2tv1feivfk8frmt1.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div><div>Once you've found those high-quality resources, construct automated harvesting rigs to target and extract those materials from the world in realtime whether you're online or offline.</div><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442130468/eder8qgdkdhotx5m23jy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div><div><p><br/></p></div><div>
<h3>Superior Crafting :// Become An Industry Master</h3>
<p>Every item from your pants to your nightlight relies on stats directly determined by the stats of the raw materials and components you fed into it during crafting.</p>
<p></p>

<br/>
<p>Increase the strength of walls by using specialized low-grade ore with a high <i>""unit toughness""</i> rating, or increase the speed and energy-efficiency of your resource harvesters by creating their circuitry using rare high ""<i>conductivity</i>"" copper. Or perhaps decrease the weight while increasing heat dissipation of your firearms  by crafting the barrels out of  alloys, then use a <b>personal factory</b> to mass-produce and sell them on the open market!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Combative and Non-Combative Progression</h3>
<p>Through careful choosing of your professions, players in Divergence can change careers as often as they like, or stick with the same profession for years on end.</p>
<p>Choose from any combination of combat-derived professions, such as <b>Bounty-Hunting, Teras Kasi, or Rifleman</b>, or totally non-combative professions such as <b>Dancing, Engineering, Narcotics, Tailoring</b>, or many, many more.</p>
<p></p>

<br/>
<p></p>
<h3>True Exploration :// True Discovery</h3>
<p>There is (without cartography) no minimap, nor world map in Divergence. You arrive on one huge 262sqkm central continent which is also surrounded on all sides by numerous additional islands and continents ranging in size from 1sqkm to over 300sqkm, many of which containing just under their surface vast quantities of undiscovered resources and wealth, just awaiting the first player explorers to discover them.</p>

<h3><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Why would I give you squat if I can download it right now, smart guy?</span></span></h3>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Because you can't mess up paying contributors stuff in the game world unless you become one of those paying contributors. In fact, as a free player, you are their plaything, created solely for their pleasure and amusement. Do we love them more than we love you? Yes. But you can buy into that same love for the one-time cost of $100! If you don't think that's a good deal, clearly you don't know jack</span></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""> about relationships.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Additionally, <b>you need a ferrocrete tool to build with ferrocrete (blocks) in our game</b>, and right now, the only way to get one is by buying-in at the $100 level.</span></p>
<h3>Wait... You're running an IndieGoGo to fund development of a game... But the game already exists? What's up with that?</h3>
<p>What's up with it is very simple;</p>
<p>Yes, the game does exist, and it is live, but it's missing crucial features required for us to consider this a ""real game"" worthy of an actual release on Steam; such as combat.</p>
<p>Right now, you can create things to an amazing extent and begin to build an awesome life for yourself on Rook. However, that guy next door who decided to build a house with ""This guy sucks"" written on it and an arrow pointing to your property... The guy who needs to get face-fisted... Well, you can't feed him his (or her) own teeth right now because there is no combat.</p>
<p>So you can clearly see that without the threat of violence to keep ones neighbors in check, society cannot exist. Without the ability to die at the hands of a dozen blood-thirsty spear-wielding lizards, life has no meaning. In essense, this game is not meant to be known merely as ""crafting simulator 2015"". In order for it to grow, we have to take it to the next level and that means a shitload of bug fixes and an even greater shitload of bullets flying.</p>
<p>Oh, and how about this reason;<b> We're two damn people</b>. Two. Two people did this, but it's going to take more than two to make this game all that it could be.</p>
<p>And thus, we aim to bring pain and suffering to the masses.</p>
<p>Help us to continue to develop the online gaming world that the world of today desperately needs; nay, deserves!</p>

Special thanks to everyone who voted for us on Steam Greenlight, but we aren't out of the woods yet - If you have friends or family who use Steam, please hassle them to take a few moments and checkout our project!
Checkout Divergence: Online on Steam Greenlight!ANNOUNCED: PVP-Optional Server To Be Included!
We've had so many articles come out wherein hundreds, if not thousands, of 
people make mention in some form that they ""would contribute if it weren't for 
the open-pvp"", that we've completely re-evaluated the situation and decided to include a second ""consentual-pvp"" server based on ""TEF"" regardless of the game's funding status, and not as a stretch goal :)
 Players on the new server can either 
spend their days harvesting, crafting, dancing, playing as non-combatants, or 
flag themselves for PVP with a ""TEF"" and engage in an afternoon of RvR 
fun.
What's a TEF?
A ""TEF"" or ""Temporary Enemy Flag"" occurs either intentionally, by flagging 
yourself via chat command, or by performing certain actions. A few of those 
are:

Healing or buffing factionally-combative players in a state of PVP.
Killing or harming faction NPCs, such as town guards of an opposing 
faction.
Being forcefully ejected from a player city or establishment where you are 
unwelcome.

Essentially, if you're playing just to craft, harvest, dance, or even if 
you're healing or aiding other players (so long as they are not recently engaged 
in PVP), you can no longer be harmed, debuffed, or otherwise negatively affected 
by other players.
Won't this require your current game code to be 
changed, and how soon would this be available?
Running a secondary ""PVP-Optional"" server will not require significant 
changes to combat, since that's already the focus of our IndieGoGo, there is 
none! It will simply require more resources to be directed at developing the 
aforementioned ""TEF"" system. This is something we're more than prepared to do 
for the players, so long as we don't have to detract money from the overall 
development of the game to do it. Therefore, what we decided to do was add a 
brand new stretch goal to invite the players to make it possible for us to 
develop this ""optional PVP"".
What we hope this'll do, is give all those people who write us and say ""I'd 
contribute but... Open PVP"" a way of putting their money where their mouth is. 
while simultaneously funding both the game itself, and the style of gameplay 
they prefer. We could bring it online even before our Steam release for 
testing.
Will there be any 
other differences between the Primary server and the secondary ""PVP-Optional"" 
server?
There will be a few minor differences between the two geared mainly to 
gently nudge people towards our primary server, such as story events, and GMs 
playing notable NPCs and faction leaders on the primary server, but as far as 
game mechanics and features are concerned, they both get the same content. 
Additionally, we're experimenting with the idea of allowing characters to 
transfer between servers if they meet certain stipulations and even keep their 
character names, so long as it can be done in a manner that neither rewards nor 
penalizes the practice.
What if people contribute specifically to make the 
PVP-Optional server happen, but then it doesn't meet that stretch 
goal?
In that case, depending on how close it comes to the goal, we'll either 
elect to do the PVP-Optional server regardless of that fact, or we'll offer 
refunds to those people. Basically in either scenario, you can't lose :)
Thanks again for all your support guys, and let’s make this damn game 
happen!
-------------------------------------------------------------

The Setting:

It's the year 2330, Earth Standard Date.
If you're a Terran Human, Synthetic, Veli Vindicator, or Lokri, you're a momentary survivor of a massive crash-landing event wherein your capitalship was inexplicably  and violently ripped from its orbit down to the surface of this alien moon.
You don't know why. Nobody knows why at this moment, but you suspect your enemies, one of the other factions your ship was locked in a Mexican standoff with only hours before, had something to do with it.
Somehow, you were pulled down to this alien, yet familiar planetoid, orbiting a super-earth.
Chaos. Bodies burning. Conduits belching violent current into twisted forms of broken super-structure, as your fellow shipmates desperately labor under yawning bulkheads to free trapped humans, aliens, and machines.
And all the while, the endless chattering in the dark just beyond the threshold of your perception.
Eyes, watching you. Two. Ten. A hundred. A thousand. My God, my science, they're everywhere! It's an attack!!!
The native creatures. Other survivors from the other ships. They're all equally dangerous; Your only hope being the frantic and desperate repair and re-establishment of make-shift cloning facilities at your base-camp immediately adjacent the smoldering ruin of your once pristine starship; Now buried face-first in a landscape hideously scarred by your arrival.
You Must Survive
Find your friends. Know where your enemies are. Venture out to establish outposts of your own but not too far, lest you be fell upon by the world's native inhabitants, agents of enemy factions, mercenaries, assassins, bandits, or even the conditions of the environment itself.

Superior Resource Surveying and HarvestingResource locations, concentrations, and individuals stats appear and disappear as they're used up all over the world's surface. Some will last mere hours, some, potentially months, so use your surveying tools to find the best resource locations and stake your claim before other players do!


Once you've found those high-quality resources, construct automated harvesting rigs to target and extract those materials from the world in realtime whether you're online or offline.
Superior Crafting :// Become An Industry Master
Every item from your pants to your nightlight relies on stats directly determined by the stats of the raw materials and components you fed into it during crafting.



Increase the strength of walls by using specialized low-grade ore with a high ""unit toughness"" rating, or increase the speed and energy-efficiency of your resource harvesters by creating their circuitry using rare high ""conductivity"" copper. Or perhaps decrease the weight while increasing heat dissipation of your firearms  by crafting the barrels out of  alloys, then use a personal factory to mass-produce and sell them on the open market!

Combative and Non-Combative Progression
Through careful choosing of your professions, players in Divergence can change careers as often as they like, or stick with the same profession for years on end.
Choose from any combination of combat-derived professions, such as Bounty-Hunting, Teras Kasi, or Rifleman, or totally non-combative professions such as Dancing, Engineering, Narcotics, Tailoring, or many, many more.




True Exploration :// True Discovery
There is (without cartography) no minimap, nor world map in Divergence. You arrive on one huge 262sqkm central continent which is also surrounded on all sides by numerous additional islands and continents ranging in size from 1sqkm to over 300sqkm, many of which containing just under their surface vast quantities of undiscovered resources and wealth, just awaiting the first player explorers to discover them.

To Be Civilized, Or To Be Civilized NotIt's up to the players to determine whether they will share resources willingly, or brutalize one another to further their own goals.Perhaps your faction, or your group within that faction, will establish a safe-haven of trade between factions governed by civic law and order. Or, perhaps you and your friends are assholes and will scour the wastelands, deserts, jungles, and forests accosting merchant caravans to liberate them of their own supplies and liqueur.




You don't need to trust us... Play the fucker right now!
Leery of cash-grab crowdsourced vaporware bullshit? We don't blame you one bit... The internets are inundated with them nowadays, aren't they.
That's why, instead of asking anyone to take our word for anything, you, the potential contributor can download the freaking thing right now and see that it isn't a bunch of crap.  It's actually less than 30% crap as a matter of fact*! Why not right now? Think (for instance) our crafting system is a bunch of Photoshop malarkey? Download the damn thing and see for yourself this minute, sucker, at:
www.Divergence-Online.com/download

Why would I give you squat if I can download it right now, smart guy?
Because you can't mess up paying contributors stuff in the game world unless you become one of those paying contributors. In fact, as a free player, you are their plaything, created solely for their pleasure and amusement. Do we love them more than we love you? Yes. But you can buy into that same love for the one-time cost of $100! If you don't think that's a good deal, clearly you don't know jack about relationships.
Additionally, you need a ferrocrete tool to build with ferrocrete (blocks) in our game, and right now, the only way to get one is by buying-in at the $100 level.
Wait... You're running an IndieGoGo to fund development of a game... But the game already exists? What's up with that?
What's up with it is very simple;
Yes, the game does exist, and it is live, but it's missing crucial features required for us to consider this a ""real game"" worthy of an actual release on Steam; such as combat.
Right now, you can create things to an amazing extent and begin to build an awesome life for yourself on Rook. However, that guy next door who decided to build a house with ""This guy sucks"" written on it and an arrow pointing to your property... The guy who needs to get face-fisted... Well, you can't feed him his (or her) own teeth right now because there is no combat.
So you can clearly see that without the threat of violence to keep ones neighbors in check, society cannot exist. Without the ability to die at the hands of a dozen blood-thirsty spear-wielding lizards, life has no meaning. In essense, this game is not meant to be known merely as ""crafting simulator 2015"". In order for it to grow, we have to take it to the next level and that means a shitload of bug fixes and an even greater shitload of bullets flying.
Oh, and how about this reason; We're two damn people. Two. Two people did this, but it's going to take more than two to make this game all that it could be.
And thus, we aim to bring pain and suffering to the masses.
Help us to continue to develop the online gaming world that the world of today desperately needs; nay, deserves!
What can you do with total freedom?



Craft completely unique items of higher or lower quality than every single other item in the world.

Have other players beg you to sell them your wares because they're a lot better than everyone elses.

Collaborate with your friends and fellow factionmates to Create a homestead/community/town/city/metropolis/Davidian compound to call your own and design it completely as you wish.


Defend your home against the guv'ment, come to take away your guns and freedoms.


Enslave the native inhabitants of the world, imprison them in cages and harvest their secretions to create insanely good narcotics that you can get totally fucked-up on, or sell to customers.


Assault scumbags who enslave the native inhabitants of the world for their sick bile-farming business and wipe their taint from the surface of the world.

Create a utopian NATO-style round-table of the major factions in the game, preventing war and maximizing quality of life for all Rook's inhabitants.
Wipe all other factions from the game world and oppress any dissent.
Bring law and order to the wilderness, prohibiting deforestation and imposing social justice.
Obliterate hippie-scum and strip-mine every square foot of rain-forest for your own benefit.

Beat the shit out of scrubs who need it.






Q: What happens if you guys don't make enough money to keep going?
Then the empire has already won. You were our last hope.

What you're talking about is a very niche market. You'd make a lot more revenue if you used ""The WoW Format.
Divergence is meant to provide an A-grade experience for a few thousand players, not a C+ experience for a million mouth-breathers.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm an indie game developer working on this amazing new game for mobille!</p>
<p>I already have experience working on video games for mobile, i created not too long ago this game called Jumping Simulator, completely free and really addicting:</p>
<p>App Store: <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jumping-simulator/id1163553061?mt=8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jumping-simulator/id1163553061?mt=8</a></p>
<p>Google Play: <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jepr.JumpingSimulator2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jepr.JumpingSimulator2</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The game will be a fresh new experience for sci-fi/psychological games, i want to combine beautiful environments with the thrill and fear of the unknown and unfathomable.</p>
<p>All the enemies will have a very bizarre look giving you a chilling and hopeless experience.</p>
<p>The environments will be gigantic and beautiful however, giving you some degree of freedom.</p>
<p>As soon as this campaign becomes successful, all the people who pledged will get the game for free! The first release might only have a few maps, one campaign level and 3 survival mode maps, but i'll add more content, more levels, maps, weapons, features, etc. All of that in updates for that very game you will have, so you won't miss a thing!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><u><i><strong>The amount i need is $500usd (same as $10,000mxn)...</strong></i></u></p>
<p>With this money i'll be able to get what i really need the most, Adobe Creative Suite.Although GIMP is useful, it's not as good as Photoshop, with Photoshop i'll be able to make high quality textures for my 3D models, with Illustrator i'll be able to create HD UI elements, with After Effects and Premiere Pro i'll be able to create amazing videos teasers and since i'm also a web developer i want to use Dreamweaver to create my own website. Needless to say, Derelict won't be my last game, so future games will also use this software for the same reasons!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>For the amazing potential backer</h3>
<p>I know sometimes it's hard to make the decision of pledging, but trust me, it's gonna be worth it!</p>
<p>Not only will you get the game for pledging any amount, but you will also get credits in the game itself and videos, you can get honorable mentions with me advertising a link or two to social media of your choosing, you can have early access to multiplayer mode, months before the general audience, you can have input on the decisions i take for the game, new weapons, characters, items or even maps! You tell me your ideas, i make them reality, and you get credits for those ideas!</p>
<p>But i think the most special thing is what i'm willing to give away if enough is pledged... knowledge. That's right, i'm willing to give you a course through a private video streaming where i'm gonna teach you how to create a First Person Shooter Video Game from scratch using unity! I'm gonna teach you everything in the most simple way (including assets and code of course), from how to make level design, to how to create the 3D models, textures, sound files, interfaces, the player, enemies, weapons, power-ups, real time events, and a hell of a lot more!</p>
<p>By the end of the course that might take two days you will go from being a total beginner, to a person fully capable to create a cross-platform video game from scratch! Just ready for you to sell it! Trust me, that is a great investment if you actually want to become a game developer!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<h3>Extra Funding</h3>
<p>Although my goal is to get that software pack, i wish to get extra funding to also pay for other software that will be as helpful to improve gaming experience in all aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>3ds Max:</strong> I want to get the license so i can use it, i had the education version of the game but it's license won't allow me to use it for this game. I'm very good with that software, the difference will be noticeable for you if i get to use 3ds Max for my game development. I'll be able to create astonishing environments with it.</li>
<li>
<strong>Unity Pro:</strong> Although Unity Personal Edition has most of the necessary tools, there are certain tools and services i need from unity pro to make the game as good as possible and prevent errors or performance drops. To prevent this, Unity Pro offers a service that allows me to monitor in real time the performance on user's phones, that way i can spot bugs more easily, the other use will be adding extra features to the enemies, since i'll be able to add more behaviors that will make the enemies harder to deal with and i'll also be able to add something called asset bundle, which will allow me to update the game much faster, and also make the app smaller in size since most 3D elements and assets will be located in a server/database thanks to this, so i'll not only be able to update the game faster but also fix bugs faster!</li>
<li>
<strong>Assets from Unity's Asset Store:</strong> I've been doing most of the work for the game in all aspects, from visual elements to programming, there are certain things that can only be added if i purchase certain assets, these assets will allow me to make the game more enjoyable and intuitive. Among the assets i want to add some are 3D models and textures, UI elements, special effects, game mechanics and extra services.</li>
<li>
<strong>More time dedicated to the game and thus getting updates done at least 3x faster:</strong> It's difficult to work on a FPS game by yourself, especially if you just graduated. With this amount i'll manage to sustain myself at least for a couple months, that way i'll be able to work faster with the updates i'll be releasing after the first release on December.</li>
</ul>
<p><u><strong><i>Although my goal is only $500usd, my wished goal is $4,000usd... with this i'll be able to make this game even more awesome and more competent with the videogame market that exists today, i'll also be able to work faster and more efficiently...</i></strong></u></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know the difference their contribution will make:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain why your project is valuable to the contributor and to the world.</li>
<li>Point out your successful track record with projects like this (if you have one).</li>
<li>Make it real for people and build trust.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>My major challenge won't be being able to work on the game, but the speed i'll be doing it, once the game is uploaded, my goal is to update it at least once a week or every two weeks, but there might be times that it might take me a little longer... not that much but still longer, this challenge can be easier to overcome if my wished goal is reached however...</p>
<p>The major risk on the other side would be on the campaign mode of the game... so far i got no problems with what i've programmed, survival mode works like a charm and multiplayer won't be an issue. The problem is not about the code or ability... is about details on the ideas i have for the story/plot of the game, there might be delays from me regarding the campaign mode because i need to make extremely precise planning to be able to make the levels exactly as i want... so that's my biggest risk and fear but nothing i can't overcome</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

</div></div>","Short Summary
I'm an indie game developer working on this amazing new game for mobille!
I already have experience working on video games for mobile, i created not too long ago this game called Jumping Simulator, completely free and really addicting:
App Store: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jumping-simulator/id1163553061?mt=8
Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jepr.JumpingSimulator2
 
The game will be a fresh new experience for sci-fi/psychological games, i want to combine beautiful environments with the thrill and fear of the unknown and unfathomable.
All the enemies will have a very bizarre look giving you a chilling and hopeless experience.
The environments will be gigantic and beautiful however, giving you some degree of freedom.
As soon as this campaign becomes successful, all the people who pledged will get the game for free! The first release might only have a few maps, one campaign level and 3 survival mode maps, but i'll add more content, more levels, maps, weapons, features, etc. All of that in updates for that very game you will have, so you won't miss a thing!
 

What We Need & What You Get
The amount i need is $500usd (same as $10,000mxn)...
With this money i'll be able to get what i really need the most, Adobe Creative Suite.Although GIMP is useful, it's not as good as Photoshop, with Photoshop i'll be able to make high quality textures for my 3D models, with Illustrator i'll be able to create HD UI elements, with After Effects and Premiere Pro i'll be able to create amazing videos teasers and since i'm also a web developer i want to use Dreamweaver to create my own website. Needless to say, Derelict won't be my last game, so future games will also use this software for the same reasons!
 
For the amazing potential backer
I know sometimes it's hard to make the decision of pledging, but trust me, it's gonna be worth it!
Not only will you get the game for pledging any amount, but you will also get credits in the game itself and videos, you can get honorable mentions with me advertising a link or two to social media of your choosing, you can have early access to multiplayer mode, months before the general audience, you can have input on the decisions i take for the game, new weapons, characters, items or even maps! You tell me your ideas, i make them reality, and you get credits for those ideas!
But i think the most special thing is what i'm willing to give away if enough is pledged... knowledge. That's right, i'm willing to give you a course through a private video streaming where i'm gonna teach you how to create a First Person Shooter Video Game from scratch using unity! I'm gonna teach you everything in the most simple way (including assets and code of course), from how to make level design, to how to create the 3D models, textures, sound files, interfaces, the player, enemies, weapons, power-ups, real time events, and a hell of a lot more!
By the end of the course that might take two days you will go from being a total beginner, to a person fully capable to create a cross-platform video game from scratch! Just ready for you to sell it! Trust me, that is a great investment if you actually want to become a game developer!
 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Extra Funding
Although my goal is to get that software pack, i wish to get extra funding to also pay for other software that will be as helpful to improve gaming experience in all aspects:


3ds Max: I want to get the license so i can use it, i had the education version of the game but it's license won't allow me to use it for this game. I'm very good with that software, the difference will be noticeable for you if i get to use 3ds Max for my game development. I'll be able to create astonishing environments with it.

Unity Pro: Although Unity Personal Edition has most of the necessary tools, there are certain tools and services i need from unity pro to make the game as good as possible and prevent errors or performance drops. To prevent this, Unity Pro offers a service that allows me to monitor in real time the performance on user's phones, that way i can spot bugs more easily, the other use will be adding extra features to the enemies, since i'll be able to add more behaviors that will make the enemies harder to deal with and i'll also be able to add something called asset bundle, which will allow me to update the game much faster, and also make the app smaller in size since most 3D elements and assets will be located in a server/database thanks to this, so i'll not only be able to update the game faster but also fix bugs faster!

Assets from Unity's Asset Store: I've been doing most of the work for the game in all aspects, from visual elements to programming, there are certain things that can only be added if i purchase certain assets, these assets will allow me to make the game more enjoyable and intuitive. Among the assets i want to add some are 3D models and textures, UI elements, special effects, game mechanics and extra services.

More time dedicated to the game and thus getting updates done at least 3x faster: It's difficult to work on a FPS game by yourself, especially if you just graduated. With this amount i'll manage to sustain myself at least for a couple months, that way i'll be able to work faster with the updates i'll be releasing after the first release on December.

Although my goal is only $500usd, my wished goal is $4,000usd... with this i'll be able to make this game even more awesome and more competent with the videogame market that exists today, i'll also be able to work faster and more efficiently...
 

The Impact
Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know the difference their contribution will make:

Explain why your project is valuable to the contributor and to the world.
Point out your successful track record with projects like this (if you have one).
Make it real for people and build trust.


Risks & Challenges
My major challenge won't be being able to work on the game, but the speed i'll be doing it, once the game is uploaded, my goal is to update it at least once a week or every two weeks, but there might be times that it might take me a little longer... not that much but still longer, this challenge can be easier to overcome if my wished goal is reached however...
The major risk on the other side would be on the campaign mode of the game... so far i got no problems with what i've programmed, survival mode works like a charm and multiplayer won't be an issue. The problem is not about the code or ability... is about details on the ideas i have for the story/plot of the game, there might be delays from me regarding the campaign mode because i need to make extremely precise planning to be able to make the levels exactly as i want... so that's my biggest risk and fear but nothing i can't overcome

Niemand weiß heute mehr, wie dieser genau aussah oder wofür er gedacht war, aber jeder kennt die Geschichte, wie alles begann…</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Eine Gruppe Kundschafter machte sich einst auf den Weg, fremde Länder zu entdecken und zu erkunden. Dabei machten sie auf einer kleinen Insel eine einzigartige Entdeckung: Sie fanden einen Schatz, der so mächtig war, dass er selbst die Krone Englands in den Schatten stellte. Schnell waren sich die Kundschafter einig, diesen Schatz zu nutzen, um nicht weiter von der Krone abhängig zu sein. Sie versteckten ihn tief im Innern der unentdeckten Insel und beschlossen, dieses Paradies als neue Heimat anzusehen.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Schnell wurde den Kundschaftern klar, dass sie nicht länger nur mit den Rohstoffen der Insel überleben könnten. Also beschlossen sie, eine weitere Insel aufzusuchen, an der sich eine Handelsroute befindet. Doch der Schatz möge bewacht bleiben und so ließen die Erkunder einen Freiwilligen zurück, der dafür sorgen würde, dass der Schatz in seinem Versteck gut behütet war.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Eine weitere Insel, an welcher oft eine Handelsflotte vorbei fuhr, war schnell gefunden und so ließen sich die Kundschafter dort nieder. Als auch hier die ersten Rohstoffe anfingen, knapp zu werden, fingen sie an, die Händler zu überfallen und die Waren zu plündern. Schließlich musste für Nachschub gesorgt werden. So waren die ersten Piraten geboren.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Doch die häufigen Angriffe auf die Handelsflotten blieben nicht unbemerkt. Schon wenige Monate später rückte die Royal Navy aus, um dem entgegen zu wirken und den Piraten Einhalt zu gebieten. In der Zwischenzeit hatten ein paar Händler ein Abkommen mit den Piraten vereinbart, welches die Handelsschiffe unbeschadet lassen würde, solange auch Handel mit den Piraten betrieben werde.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">So entstand ein Krieg zwischen den Piraten und der Navy, der bis heute andauert. Die Generationen kamen und gingen und mit der Zeit geriet die unentdeckte, paradiesische Insel, wie auch der mystische Schatz in Vergessenheit und blieb lediglich als mündliche Überlieferung bestehen.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""> </p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508701513/avudwvp9ivzoic1wmb2h.png"" src=""""/> A long long time ago there has been a very special treasure.

But everyone knows the story of the beginning...</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Once a group of scouts set off to find foreign territories and discover them. So they detect something unique on an isle: They found a treasure, so mighty, that it outshined the queen herself.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">A short time after the scouts have agreed on using the treasure to get independent. So they've hidden it deep inside the undetected Isle and decided to call this paradise their new home.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">A view weeks later the scouts were clear in their mind, that they couldn't survive only with the ressources of the isle. Then they decided to search for a new island with an existing trading route nearby. But the treasure had still to be watched and so the scouts let a volunteer stay to keep a jelous watch over the treasure while the others have left the isle.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Another island with an trading route nearby has been found quickly and the scouts settled down. When the first ressources ran short on the new island, too, the scouts began to hi-jack the first trading ships and reaved their goods to save the supplies. So the first pirates were born.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">But the frequent attacks on the trading ships haven't been unnoticed. Already a view months  </p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">later the Royal Navy got ready to fight against the pirates. Within this time a view tradesmen got a contract with the pirates. The ships gotn't damage as long as they've been merchandising with the pirates.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">That's how todays' war between the pirates and the Royal Navy began.

Das Spiel kann entweder mit Maus und Tastatur oder einem Game Pad gespielt werden.In den Städten kann man bei den NPCs Aufgaben (Quests) annehmen und nach erfolgreichem Abschluss wieder abgeben. Außerdem kann man neue Teile wie Segel, Flaggen, Rumpf, Kanonen für sein Schiff, wie auch weitere Schiffe an Land erwerben und in einer Werft die Teile an seinem Schiff anbringen lassen. Außerdem steht es jedem frei, das Land auf eigene Faust zu erkunden. Vielleicht stößt man ja etwas außerhalb auf eine bisher unentdeckte Höhle…Auf See befindet sich das Schlachtfeld, auf dem sich die Piraten mit der Royal Navy anlegen oder auch gemeinsam als Gilde in den Kampf gegen einen Killerwal ziehen können. Doch auch die Händler sind mit Kanonen bewaffnet unterwegs, um ihre Waren vor den Piraten zu schützen und unbeschadet ans Ziel gelangen zu können.   „Hunting on Myths“ is an adventure MMORPG playing in the pirate age. At the beginning of the game the player can decide to enter the adventure as part of the Royal Navy, tradesmen or a pirate.

Niemand weiß heute mehr, wie dieser genau aussah oder wofür er gedacht war, aber jeder kennt die Geschichte, wie alles begann…Eine Gruppe Kundschafter machte sich einst auf den Weg, fremde Länder zu entdecken und zu erkunden. Dabei machten sie auf einer kleinen Insel eine einzigartige Entdeckung: Sie fanden einen Schatz, der so mächtig war, dass er selbst die Krone Englands in den Schatten stellte. Schnell waren sich die Kundschafter einig, diesen Schatz zu nutzen, um nicht weiter von der Krone abhängig zu sein. Sie versteckten ihn tief im Innern der unentdeckten Insel und beschlossen, dieses Paradies als neue Heimat anzusehen.Schnell wurde den Kundschaftern klar, dass sie nicht länger nur mit den Rohstoffen der Insel überleben könnten. Also beschlossen sie, eine weitere Insel aufzusuchen, an der sich eine Handelsroute befindet. Doch der Schatz möge bewacht bleiben und so ließen die Erkunder einen Freiwilligen zurück, der dafür sorgen würde, dass der Schatz in seinem Versteck gut behütet war.Eine weitere Insel, an welcher oft eine Handelsflotte vorbei fuhr, war schnell gefunden und so ließen sich die Kundschafter dort nieder. Als auch hier die ersten Rohstoffe anfingen, knapp zu werden, fingen sie an, die Händler zu überfallen und die Waren zu plündern. Schließlich musste für Nachschub gesorgt werden. So waren die ersten Piraten geboren.Doch die häufigen Angriffe auf die Handelsflotten blieben nicht unbemerkt. Schon wenige Monate später rückte die Royal Navy aus, um dem entgegen zu wirken und den Piraten Einhalt zu gebieten. In der Zwischenzeit hatten ein paar Händler ein Abkommen mit den Piraten vereinbart, welches die Handelsschiffe unbeschadet lassen würde, solange auch Handel mit den Piraten betrieben werde.So entstand ein Krieg zwischen den Piraten und der Navy, der bis heute andauert. Die Generationen kamen und gingen und mit der Zeit geriet die unentdeckte, paradiesische Insel, wie auch der mystische Schatz in Vergessenheit und blieb lediglich als mündliche Überlieferung bestehen.  A long long time ago there has been a very special treasure. Today noone ever knows, how it does look like or why it has been. But everyone knows the story of the beginning...Once a group of scouts set off to find foreign territories and discover them. So they detect something unique on an isle: They found a treasure, so mighty, that it outshined the queen herself.A short time after the scouts have agreed on using the treasure to get independent. So they've hidden it deep inside the undetected Isle and decided to call this paradise their new home.A view weeks later the scouts were clear in their mind, that they couldn't survive only with the ressources of the isle. Then they decided to search for a new island with an existing trading route nearby. But the treasure had still to be watched and so the scouts let a volunteer stay to keep a jelous watch over the treasure while the others have left the isle.Another island with an trading route nearby has been found quickly and the scouts settled down. When the first ressources ran short on the new island, too, the scouts began to hi-jack the first trading ships and reaved their goods to save the supplies. So the first pirates were born.But the frequent attacks on the trading ships haven't been unnoticed. Already a view months  later the Royal Navy got ready to fight against the pirates. Within this time a view tradesmen got a contract with the pirates. The ships gotn't damage as long as they've been merchandising with the pirates.That's how todays' war between the pirates and the Royal Navy began. The generations have been coming and going and over the decades the undetected, paradisiac isle with the mystical treasure fell into oblivion. There only was an oral tradition about this story.  Es stehen verschiedene Piratenbuchten für den Eintritt in das Abenteuer zur Auswahl. Als Pirat muss man sich um die Versorgung kümmern, indem man andere Schiffe überfällt und entert. Natürlich sitzt einem dabei auch die Royal Navy im Nacken, die stetig versucht, die Piraten an ihrem Vorhaben zu hindern.

  Es stehen verschiedene Stützpunkte der Royal Navy für den Eintritt in das Abenteuer zur Auswahl. Als Teil der Royal Navy hat man die Hauptaufgabe, das Land von Piraten zu befreien und für Frieden und Sicherheit in der Welt zu sorgen.

Can't visit harbours of the pirates
Ship has canons to fight
  Als Händler ist man unabhängig und hat freien Zugang zu den Stützpunkten der Royal Navy, als auch zu den Piraten buchten. Doch auch ein Händler muss sich auf den ein oder anderen Kampf gegen andere Schiffe einstellen. Daher sollte ein Händler seine Waren mit Bedacht verkaufen. Denn sobald er eine Fraktion durch einen Handel unterstützt hat, bekommt der Händler ein schlechteres Ansehen bei der anderen Fraktion.

Nach Beitritt einer Gilde durch den Spieler (der automatische Eintritt durch einen Gildenpass zählt in diesem Falle nicht!) ist der Spieler 7 Tage für einen weiteren Beitritt gesperrt (um zu schnelles Wechseln zu verhindern)
Schiff ist mit kleinen Kanonen ausgerüstet
  As a tradesman you're independent and have free access to the bases of the Royal Navy and also to the pirate bays. But a tradesman has to fight against some ship or other. The goods have to be traded advisedly, because if you support a fraction by dealing, you'll get a worse prestige at the other fraction.
Trademan value from -50 to 50 possible
At game start: value is 0
Per trade with pirates: value goes -1
Per trade with the Royal Navy: value goes +1
With value from -5 to 50 you’re allowed to visit harbours of the Royal Navy

By joining a guild oft he Royal Navy the value rises to +15
By joining a tradesmen guild the value goes until 10 points to 0
After joining a guild by a player, the player is locked for 7 days to join a new guild (this should prevent fast switching; in case of automatic joining by a guild pass this locking doesn’t count.)

Royal Navy mit Hilfe der Händler die Herrschaft über die Meere zu sichern und als Händler das Gleichgewicht zwischen den Fraktionen zu wahren. Das Besondere dabei ist, dass ein Händler zur eigenen Verteidigung nur eine kleine Kanone mit sich führen und bei wertvollen Waren Begleitschutz brauchen wird. Ein Pirat, bzw. ein Schiff der Royal Navy sollte einen Händler mit sich führen, damit Waren von geenterten/ besiegten Schiffen in den nächsten Hafen transportiert werden können.An Land selbst findet kein PvP statt, außer man befindet sich in einer der dafür speziell vorgesehenen Arenen. Die betretbaren Inseln sind vielmehr wichtiger Bestandteil für das Questsystem, Handel oder auch den Erkundungsfaktor.   Was ist das Hauptziel?Wie der Titel schon vermuten lässt, geht es in dem Spiel darum, einen großen mystischen Schatz zu finden und diesen dann auch vor den anderen Fraktionen zu verteidigen.Das ganze wird im Laufe des Spiels mit verschiedenen Events und geänderten Content unterstützt.  Wie genau wird das Questsystem aussehen?Jede Fraktion hat ihre Ansicht der Hauptstory zur Verfügung. Wichtige Punkte der Geschichte sind hierbei in der Geschichte jeder Partei integriert. Neben der Hauptstoryline und verschiedenen Nebenquests wird es auch eine persönliche Storyline geben. Diese variiert anhand der Antworten des Fragebogens in der Charaktererstellung. Es gibt Aufgaben, die man direkt vor Ort, bzw. auf der Insel erledigen kann. Doch es gibt ebenso Aufgaben, die sich auf anderen Inseln oder auf hoher See abspielen. Hierzu gibt es auch spezielle Instanzen und Raidbosse.  Steuert man jetzt einen Schiff oder Charakter? In welcher Perspektive?Sowohl als auch. An Land steuert man den Charakter mit WASD oder Gamepad (Mapping anpassbar, verwendbare Controller u.a. XBox/Playstation/Steam) in der 3rd Person Perspektive. Später ist auch ein Umschalten in die Ego Perspektive möglich.Auf See kann man das Schiff per Mausklick, bzw. über den linken Analogstick steuern. Mit WASD, bzw. dem rechten Analogstick lässt sich die Kamera über die gesamte Welt bewegen.   Wie groß ist die Welt?Zu Beginn bezieht sich die Map (über anfahrbare Häfen lassen sich Inseln betreten) auf eine Seekarte mit ein paar wenigen Häfen und Inseln (für die Alpha sind bisher 15 Städte geplant).Im späteren Spielverlauf soll die Welt von Contenterweiterung zu Contenterweiterung wachsen, bis eines Tages ein Globus (geschlossener Kreislauf) entsteht.  Was ist unter einem Gamepad oder einem Controller zu verstehen?Mit Gamepad/Controller sind unter anderem XBox, Playstation und Steamcontroller für PC gemeint.   Was enthält die Alpha Version, die mit dem Early Access heraus kommen soll?Ein komplett spielbares Startgebiet mit verschiedenen Inseln für jede Fraktion. Außerdem ist die PvP-Funktion auf hoher See komplett integriert.  Wie sieht es zwecks PvP / Konfrontation zweier Fraktionen in Gebieten ""außerhalb"" aus?Da ist das Spiel klar definiert. Befindet man sich mit dem Schiff auf hoher See, bzw. mit dem Charakter in einer Arena, ist dort ein PvP-Gebiet. Häfen der Piraten, bzw. der Royal Navy können nicht von der jeweils anderen Partei befahren oder angegriffen werden. Ein Händler muss entsprechendes Vertrauen in die jeweilige Fraktion haben, um deren Häfen ansteuern zu können. Doch es gibt auch Häfen und Städte mit neutralem Boden, wo Piraten und Royal Navy freundlich gesinnt aufeinander treffen.

<p>Together we are working on creating and implementing a very special, never seen before Artificial Intelligence engine called SSAI (Subconscious Sentiment Artificial Intelligence)</p>
<p>SSAI is a magical piece of software that grabs your sentiment and behaviour as a player and feeds it into the game to give you a personalised gameplay experience.</p>
<p>As Musa, you the player have a direct yet subconscious impact on the behaviour of your little brother. Every player will get to explore this sibling dynamic in their own personalised way.</p>
<p>This has never been done before and we have great plans for the engine to give you really exciting gameplay.</p>
<p>This is another great reason for you to back our crowdfunding campaign, so that together we can bring this AI innovation to the world.</p>
</div><h3><strong>THE STORY</strong></h3><p>""Musa- a brother's story"" is a story of two refugee brothers. The shows the journey that refugee children go through, using meaningful and engaging gameplay. </p><p>The player plays as Musa, the older brother, who is now in charge of the care-taking of his younger brother.</p><h3><strong>WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT</strong></h3><p>""Musa-a brother's story"" is a game that shows the journey of two refugee brothers. It's of the puzzle adventure genre, and is 2.5d. It is a single player game where the player is Musa, and is an examination of the sibling relationship<br/>What makes the game stand out, are two things.<br/>1. It highlights a cause that is very much a crisis of our age and is inspired by true stories (availed through partner agencies) <br/>2. It will employ a <strong>new AI Engine that will map players input behaviour</strong> and make changes to the behaviour of the brother NPC, based on this information. This includes indicators like effective exploring of the level, reading or observing in game material, button mashing etc. Thus we use a<strong> players subconscious choices to create customised gameplay.</strong></p><h3><strong>GAME MECHANICS</strong></h3><p>There are three main game mechanics or gameplay elements that are in the game.</p><p>1. Musa is able to interact with his environment, including observing, climbing over, hiding etc. </p><p>2. The game also employs quicktime events where players need to react fast, during running or adrenaline packed levels.</p><p>3. Musa is an avid inventor so part of the game play would be him crafting different items to take gameplay forward or just create toys for his little brother.</p><p>4. AI element that records subconscious behaviour.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525422839/cv0hwcqsdrgqujfzbpbv.png"" src=""""/></p><h3><strong>THE PROTOTYPE</strong></h3><p>In the first level that I created, Musa wakes up in his house, his bedroom. It is partially destroyed. He is afraid and confused. He starts exploring the house, looking for his parents, while observing his changed environment and overcoming obstacles in the destroyed home. He does not find his parents, but does find his little brother, and then safely guides  him outside the house. This is how Musa's story begins, just like a lot of refugee children. He goes to bed just a normal child, and wakes up an orphan, a refugee and a guardian to his younger brother.</p><p>This is the level that was showcased at IGN. Musa could observe his environment, interact with it, search for his brother, and will be able to overcome environmental puzzles as well.</p><h3><strong>THE FINAL PRODUCT</strong></h3><p>Of course I know that this is a very sensitive story to share, and I don't want to do it in isolation or misrepresent it in any way.<strong> This is why I am currently in conversations with a global refugee agency to cover authentic stories in the game.  The complete Musa story will be a culmination of these authentic stories put together.</strong></p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525369933/luysidgpnculqkxiotos.png"" src=""""/></h3><p>In order to tell you why I'm creating a video game about the refugee crisis, I need to tell you my story.</p><p>In 2014, I went on a short trip to Turkey, to volunteer at an organic farm.

<p><strong>Do I really think creating a video game can make an positive impact to the refugee cause? Absolutely!</strong></p>
<p>People take positive action when they are driven by empathy. And video games as a medium is the best way to inspire this empathy. It's not a facebook video that you can skip or a news channel that you can change. This is an immersive and engaging medium that will show the story instead of telling it. Imagine having a deep understanding of this situation. It can change the way refugees are treated by residents anywhere. I am not trying to change policies, I'm trying to change hearts and attitudes.</p>
<p>But don't just take my word for it. There are two recent studies out by UNESCO that show a direct correlation between digital games and empathy.</p>

<p>In addition to raising awareness,  I plan to do to directly contribute, is to donate 2.5% of all sales revenue from the game back to the cause.</p>

<p>And finally, I plan to make this a collaborative work of art, with contributions from refugees themselves.

Together we are working on creating and implementing a very special, never seen before Artificial Intelligence engine called SSAI (Subconscious Sentiment Artificial Intelligence)
SSAI is a magical piece of software that grabs your sentiment and behaviour as a player and feeds it into the game to give you a personalised gameplay experience.
As Musa, you the player have a direct yet subconscious impact on the behaviour of your little brother. Every player will get to explore this sibling dynamic in their own personalised way.
This has never been done before and we have great plans for the engine to give you really exciting gameplay.
This is another great reason for you to back our crowdfunding campaign, so that together we can bring this AI innovation to the world.
THE STORY""Musa- a brother's story"" is a story of two refugee brothers. The shows the journey that refugee children go through, using meaningful and engaging gameplay. The player plays as Musa, the older brother, who is now in charge of the care-taking of his younger brother.WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT""Musa-a brother's story"" is a game that shows the journey of two refugee brothers. It's of the puzzle adventure genre, and is 2.5d. It is a single player game where the player is Musa, and is an examination of the sibling relationshipWhat makes the game stand out, are two things.1. It highlights a cause that is very much a crisis of our age and is inspired by true stories (availed through partner agencies) 2. It will employ a new AI Engine that will map players input behaviour and make changes to the behaviour of the brother NPC, based on this information. This includes indicators like effective exploring of the level, reading or observing in game material, button mashing etc. Thus we use a players subconscious choices to create customised gameplay.GAME MECHANICSThere are three main game mechanics or gameplay elements that are in the game.1. Musa is able to interact with his environment, including observing, climbing over, hiding etc. 2. The game also employs quicktime events where players need to react fast, during running or adrenaline packed levels.3. Musa is an avid inventor so part of the game play would be him crafting different items to take gameplay forward or just create toys for his little brother.4. AI element that records subconscious behaviour.THE PROTOTYPEIn the first level that I created, Musa wakes up in his house, his bedroom. It is partially destroyed. He is afraid and confused. He starts exploring the house, looking for his parents, while observing his changed environment and overcoming obstacles in the destroyed home. He does not find his parents, but does find his little brother, and then safely guides  him outside the house. This is how Musa's story begins, just like a lot of refugee children. He goes to bed just a normal child, and wakes up an orphan, a refugee and a guardian to his younger brother.This is the level that was showcased at IGN. Musa could observe his environment, interact with it, search for his brother, and will be able to overcome environmental puzzles as well.THE FINAL PRODUCTOf course I know that this is a very sensitive story to share, and I don't want to do it in isolation or misrepresent it in any way. This is why I am currently in conversations with a global refugee agency to cover authentic stories in the game.  The complete Musa story will be a culmination of these authentic stories put together.In order to tell you why I'm creating a video game about the refugee crisis, I need to tell you my story.In 2014, I went on a short trip to Turkey, to volunteer at an organic farm. It was a difficult time in my life and I decided to do something to re-discover myself by being in nature and working with my hands.I also happened to spend a few days in Istanbul, where I saw something I was not expecting. Numerous child refugees, and whole families living under a bridge. There were children on each tourist street, some entertaining the crowd for money, some selling trinkets to get by and some just begging. I still remember the boy who followed me over 300 meters at Taksim just because I didn't have any change to give him. He was barefoot, and it was a cold October.All these children were refugees, and their memories and faces stayed with me. Upon my return I decided to donate more to the refugee cause, but I wasn't satisfied with my impact. I wanted to do more. I wanted to tell their stories, give them a human face, and a name, and allow others to see their journey. So I turned to video games. This was an art form that I was good at, and I decided to use it for impact.You see,  I have grown up playing video games, they have been my escape for the longest time, especially in hard times.

So, don't underestimate the impact of your pledge amount. Your contribution can make a huge difference!
 
Why am I raising money? Well, I am currently working on the game by myself and a little help from my wonderful husband and co-founder of our studio, Sajad Hameed, who believes in me more than anyone. But if I am to tell this story and tell it well, then I need to do this full time and put all my focus on this. I need to cover my development costs, and I need more people. I need a bigger team, so that we can give ""Musa"" the treatment it deserves. I am raising $23,000 in this campaign. This is not enough to completely develop, market and launch the game, but it's a good start.The amount that I am raising here is just enough for me to quit my job and direct all my energy to making this game a reality and making this my full time work. The amount will also allow me to buy a new PC to continue development. (I am still using my 8 year old alienware to type this, and developing the game currently). This amount is good enough for at least 5 months of development at the end of which we are going to complete a 3 complete levels, the proprietary AI engine in place, as well as the full story and game design plan.Doing this full-time will give me enough room to work on the development as well as working on making the business sustainable, and raising more funds later on.You can check at the bottom on what I plan to do, if we raise more than the campaign target.And of course, you don't go away empty-handed when you contribute.I have created some really cool perks, based on the amount you pledge here.  
But wait...I know what you may be thinking. Can she really do it? The answer is ""yes,"". All I know is that I have a lot more to lose here if I don't make this work. I am quitting my full time job as a consultant in a great company, and I'm certainly not a young man right out of college who will just join the workforce if this doesn't work out.But here the things that will go right.

<p>One of the <strong>great perks</strong> on Indiegogo is the option to <strong>Design a Card</strong>. You will <strong>work with</strong> the <strong>Doonamai</strong> team to pick the <strong>card type, traits/abilities, stats, and appearance</strong>. Let's show you how that process works:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1594678409/s4sdfepmiw8lja1tqghu.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Backers</strong> will first choose a <strong>card type</strong> from the options above. Then they will choose what they want the <strong>traits and/or abilities</strong> to be. Here is where there can be a lot of <strong>freedom</strong> as long as it fits within the game rules. Maybe you want an <strong>assassin</strong>, but also want an ability that <strong>makes it unique</strong>. This would be the time to define how that card will be used in-game.<br/><br/>Next you will pick what you want the Strength and Skill of the the card to be if it is a Unit. Our <strong>algorithms</strong> will adjust the <strong>skill, cost, and rarity</strong> with you to find a <strong>balanced medium</strong> that gives you what you want.</p>
<p>Finally, you will <strong>describe</strong> what you want the <strong>art</strong> to look like and we will get <strong>concept sketches</strong> from our artists. Once you <strong>pick the sketch</strong> you like we will <strong>progress to final card</strong>. Let's show you what that process can look like from a Backer that has already designed a card:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1594678425/fxyeho7cdvx5qqvlstps.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here the <strong>Backer</strong> chose to <strong>create a Unit</strong>. He wanted an <strong>ability that would transform</strong> a low-power Unit into a very high-power Unit. We settled on a ""Pay 7 to transform into a 13 Strength - 4 Skill Airborne with 'Deal 3 damage to Target' ability."" Assuming a base Strength and Skill of 1 to keep the <strong>card cost down</strong>, the <strong>algorithm</strong> showed we could have the <strong>cost of the card</strong> be 4 Knowledge Points and have a Diamond rarity.</p>
<p>From there the Backer described the <strong>Unit's appearance</strong> as a purple dragon that started small and cuter in appearance, but actually had a <strong>hidden larger form</strong> that he would transform into. We sent that description to get <strong>concept sketches</strong> and allowed the Backer to choose which he want to see as a final product. After the <strong>portrait art</strong> was finished we were able to build the final card: </p>

<p> </p>
<p>As you can see, if you choose to <strong>Design a Card</strong> you will get to be <strong>involved</strong> with a lot of the <strong>process</strong> and put a <strong>unique spin</strong> on a card in <strong>Dark Table CCG</strong>. Your name will be added to the <strong>credits</strong> as the <strong>designer of the card</strong> and you will leave a permanent mark on the game. This is a very <strong>unique opportunity</strong> and once that <strong>won't be offered for long</strong>.</p>
<p>Now that you have seen what is being offered, it is time to <strong>learn how Dark Table CCG works</strong>, what <strong>types of cards</strong> exist, and <strong>how they function</strong>.</p>

One of the great perks on Indiegogo is the option to Design a Card. You will work with the Doonamai team to pick the card type, traits/abilities, stats, and appearance. Let's show you how that process works:
 

 
Backers will first choose a card type from the options above. Then they will choose what they want the traits and/or abilities to be. Here is where there can be a lot of freedom as long as it fits within the game rules. Maybe you want an assassin, but also want an ability that makes it unique. This would be the time to define how that card will be used in-game.Next you will pick what you want the Strength and Skill of the the card to be if it is a Unit. Our algorithms will adjust the skill, cost, and rarity with you to find a balanced medium that gives you what you want.
Finally, you will describe what you want the art to look like and we will get concept sketches from our artists. Once you pick the sketch you like we will progress to final card. Let's show you what that process can look like from a Backer that has already designed a card:
 

 
Here the Backer chose to create a Unit. He wanted an ability that would transform a low-power Unit into a very high-power Unit. We settled on a ""Pay 7 to transform into a 13 Strength - 4 Skill Airborne with 'Deal 3 damage to Target' ability."" Assuming a base Strength and Skill of 1 to keep the card cost down, the algorithm showed we could have the cost of the card be 4 Knowledge Points and have a Diamond rarity.
From there the Backer described the Unit's appearance as a purple dragon that started small and cuter in appearance, but actually had a hidden larger form that he would transform into. We sent that description to get concept sketches and allowed the Backer to choose which he want to see as a final product. After the portrait art was finished we were able to build the final card: 
 

 
As you can see, if you choose to Design a Card you will get to be involved with a lot of the process and put a unique spin on a card in Dark Table CCG. Your name will be added to the credits as the designer of the card and you will leave a permanent mark on the game. This is a very unique opportunity and once that won't be offered for long.
Now that you have seen what is being offered, it is time to learn how Dark Table CCG works, what types of cards exist, and how they function.
 

 In Dark Table your health for a game is dictated by the leader you choose. Each leader has different amounts of health based on its rarity, enrage ability, and enrage cost. Leaders with low enrage cost will typically have lower health, so carefully craft your deck around your leader.   Each leader has specific “Enrage Abilities” that significantly affect the game once triggered. Enrage Abilities have different trigger types such as Knowledge Level, Berserk, and Bloodshed.Knowledge Enrage Abilities required a certain level of knowledge be obtained in a game before the leader unlocks. For this type of leader, all knowledge points not used at the end of the battle phase goes into your knowledge pool toward the trigger. Knowledge Enrages usually have to stall the longest to get an Enrage.Berserk Enrages require the Leader to be damaged down to a threshold health level in order to enrage and unlock. This creates particularly interesting mechanics which can dissuade early game damage to a Berserk Leader.Bloodshed Enrages require a certain number of deaths in combat by your creatures, traps, or spells. Death of your own creatures counts toward the trigger. Poison kills after your Battle Phase do not count. Bloodshed makes for a very aggressive early game.  Strength of a unit is the amount of health the unit currently has and also the amount of damage it can do to another unit. As a unit is damaged its strength lowers, which means it has lower health and produces less damage. For example, if a 2-strength unit battles a 5-strength unit, the 5-strength unit will end the fight with 3 strength meaning it has 3 health left and can only produce 3 damage. Any healing to a unit restores its strength thus increasing its damage back up to the original.  Skill is the measurement of fighting experience of a unit. Units will only take damage in a battle if the opposing unit has equal or greater skill. Skill adds a layer of complexity to battles, requiring players to find ways to take down higher skill creatures.Apprentice of Old takes no damage since he has 4 skill while Angel of Lucra has 2 skill.Both units have 4 skill, so they deal damage to each other. One method is to use the 3 skill tokens provided each round. These tokens can add a skill to a unit for the turn, which could possibly make a battle worth fighting. Only one skill tokens can be used on a unit per turn, and they are reset to the pool after all battle phases are complete.  Each unit can have a trait and/or ability. Traits are passive and can alter how a unit works. Abilities may be passive or activated and can usually do more versatile actions.Walls are a trait that means it must be attacked first. They are a barrier or barricade between the enemies and your units/leader.Heroes are next after a wall in being attacked before other units or leaders can be attacked. Heroes are usually enticing or extravagant and draw the attention of attackers. Heroes usually have low skill and higher strengthAirborne units can attack over walls but still just attack heroes first before other units.Assassins can sneak around walls and heroes to attack units or leaders directly. They usually have low strength and higher skill.Focus is a trait that gives a unit 1 skill when attacking.Rally Cry gives all your units +1 strength when attacking that battle phase.Frenzy means that a creature can keep attacking units that battle phase if it is not killed in battle. Hitting a wall or leader stops this effect.Confusion reduces the skill of a unit by 1 when battled.  Spells and traps can also be played during the release phase. Spells perform an action during the phase, while traps are stored on the board after being played and are activated by a condition.  Dark Table is split predominantly into two phases, a release phase and battle phase. At the start of each turn, everyone's knowledge pool is replenished with a starting size of 10. Knowledge is used as the cost to release cards. During the release phase, players can release units, walls, and traps to the board. Any new cards are hidden from the enemies, while anything played in previous turns is shown. This phase happens for all players at the same time. The intent here is for players to be forced to make their own strategy without knowing what others may have played and reacting solely to that.  The second phase is comprised of the battle phases for everyone in the game. One player will get the battle chip at random in the beginning of the game and be the first to have a battle phase. Then, each player will have a battle phase in a clockwise rotation. At a battle phase, players can use units and spells to attack other units and leaders, if possible. At the completion of the battle phases, the battle chip will move to the next player in a clockwise rotation, leaving them to attack first next turn. This rotation of first attack can be a very unique mechanic that can be used for strategy.   Some of the most fun in multiplayer card games comes from the table politics that ensue. Players often make temporary alliances to change the advantage in the game or dethrone someone in power. Dark Table offers an Alliance mechanic to assist in creating table politics in a digital card game. You may select an opponent to alliance with, and then an opponent you want to fight. If the alliance is accepted it means that the players may be temporarily aligned in a target.    The game does not force the alliance to be fulfilled, but those that follow the temporary alliance can earn extra in-game currency. The goal is to use this mechanic to plan attacks if more than one player is required to restore balance.   One of the features that sets Dark Table apart from other digital CCG’s is the ability to play with up to 4 players in a Free-For-All.   The game’s alliance system allows players to make a temporary alliance with others in order to stop the largest threat on the table. This acts as a balancing measure when some players have better cards, but can also be a bluffing tactic to get an advantage.  One annoyance of other digital CCG’s is the reliance on packs, loot boxes, or endless grinding to build the deck you want. Dark Table takes a different approach; all cards can be bought with in-game currency, paid currency, or deck tokens so you can focus on the fun of deck-building.   The hope is that deck-building will be similar to real-life CCG’s and less like a gambling experience that makes you sink a ton of money before you can play the cards you want. At any time you can build a deck using a $20 deck token, no matter the value of the individual cards, so you can spend your time theory-crafting and playing decks and not stressing about cost.  Roles offer a means to gain more in-game currency while ranking up in your favorite play-style and earning special in-game items. At the beginning of each game you can select between The Brute, The Joker, and The Strategist.   The Brute will give rewards based on hitting face and dealing more damage, The Joker will incentivize being a troll and upsetting the game balance over winning, and The Strategist will value brooding combos and Knowledge gains. Mastering roles can earn you cards, skins, borders and other items that are specific to the role.  While other E-sports push 1v1 or team dynamic skills, Dark Table will offer a very new style of E-sport. Players will now have to learn how to survive in a 4-player free-for-all and learn how to use table politics and deception to win. These mechanics will be a shock to some, and a refreshing strategy to master for others.   The idea is that Dark Table will mix some mechanics of Poker with that of CCG’s, creating more layers of strategy to the sport than simply knowing the best cards, combos, and what to counter. Where a 1v1 builds a framework for aggressiveness and constant board state dominance to win, a multiplayer format allows for large swings in advantage. This means that players may need to save power plays for the correct opportunity to maximize the outcome, without letting other's know what's coming.  Each ranked season will have an entry pass for purchase that goes toward the prize pool that season. During the game players will be anonymous so you can’t prioritize targets based on reputation. After each game the players will be revealed. Rank up by winning or eliminating other players.   The farther you progress in a season the more rewards and achievements you will earn. Rewards for each season lock after that season, so player can earn unique card borders, backs, and more to be used as swag in future games.  In Dark Table CCG you will have the ability to create custom games if you want to play with your friends or if you want to organize tournaments yourself.   This option will allow 2-4 players which can also aid in testing decks or if you want a more casual experience. Custom games will have settings to allow for longer turns if you don't want to be rushed. This may also be a more familiar setting for some of the physical card game players, or may be used as an alternative when your local game shop is closed.  Each player will pick a starter deck at account creation to play with until they earn enough to build their own. One leader of each enrage type will be available.  Dark Table CCG will start with a set list of around 200 cards, 16 of which will be leaders. There will be additional sets of 100 cards at a time that will be phased into the game over time and bring unique mechanics that will add to possible play styles and combos.         Doonamai has amassed a fantastic team of professionals to work on Dark Table CCG.

Shipping would not start until late this year at the earliest, so hopefully there will be no delays.          Risks and challenges Doonamai and its team has experience making games, but any large project such as this has risks. While being a registered Microsoft and PlayStation Developer, we have yet to be approved for Nintendo Switch. The hope is that with the attention of the project we can get Nintendo's approval. We also know that while Xbox and PlayStation will be easier to port to, Switch may take some additional work due to the UI changes that would be required to accommodate the handheld screen.There is also the risk with building a large scale competitive game and tournaments. Luckily we are working with professional players and those with experience in card game tournaments. Together we will acquire the expertise and knowledge to ensure a proper player experience.",95.0,3,"1 Campaign

My team members experience, expertise, and leadership skills is what qualifies me to gain your trust, I say please become a contributor to my Funding Campaign.
Risks & Challenges 
I limited my (risk and challenges) because I built professional (systems) around my Invention, which is my team members.  Those are some of the hurdles, and struggles that people face to be successful as business owners. It also cut the cost of my funding down dramatically through their start up (free) services, and being part of my team.
How I will deal with Risk and Challenges, I would look at my business, competition, and reevaluate what works, and doesn't.  calculate my charts, financial statements, balance sheets evaluate quarterly adjustment growth , fix the weaknesses that needs to be made, and capitalize on my strength, with meetings of my (professional systems), which is my business team members. Then, make my final adjustments, of hurdles, and risk factors and challenges that we would face like Customer Acqusition Cost, Profit and Profit Margins.

Other ways you could show your support for me, (Kashani Aytch), future inventor is just get the word out. Through social media, word of mouth, and make a buzz about my Funding Campaign on Indiegogo.

<p>Hello</p>
<p>My name is Dave but most of you know me as Coins. I write
stories about people who find magical coins that grant wishes. Often these
coins will grant the wishes in a way the wisher didn’t expect.</p>
<p>For more than a year now I have been looking for a way to
bring my stories to the next level. I finally found a way when I was playing an
old text adventure game from the 80s. With some help from a few programming
classes I came to the conclusion that I could make these myself.</p>
<p>Now imagine a story where you are the main character. Your
choices matter and everything you do can alter the story in unexpected ways.  You find a wishing coin and ask to be treated
nicer and suddenly you’re a beautiful woman or a child. Maybe you change one of
your classmates into a maid. Everything can happen once you set foot in the
coiniverse (Coin universe).</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>So why do I need money? Most of the time will be put in
writing the stories lines. This is all on me. I will put the time, the effort
and my creativity into the story but I do need to be able to distribute the
game online. But I know what you really want to know. What do YOU get for your
money?</p>
<p>The game will be text only but through dialog options you
will be able to choose your own adventure. </p>
<p>Any backer who donates 5 euro’s or more will get access to
the game and even early access if available. </p>
<p>Every backer who donates 10 Euro’s will find their name in a
special thank you during the games end credits.</p>
<p>For every backer who donates more than 15 euro’s I will make
a special thank you video on my YouTube channel.</p>
<p>Every backer who donates over 25 Euro’s will receive the
name in the game perk. This will give a random character in the game their
name.</p>
<p>Every backer who donates over 50 euro’s will be contacted by
me personally and I will make a personalised video just for them.</p>
<p>Now if you have deep enough pockets to donate 100 Euro’s I
will give you the side entrance perk. This means that I will contact you and together
we make a special chapter in the game just for you where you decided what happened.
Only you will have that chapter of the game and the character that we create
together in that chapter will be appearing in the main game.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>If this project becomes a success then it will not be a onetime
project. I will launch a website where I will keep making games like this for
everyone to enjoy. </p>
<p>The project may seem a bit barebones right now but if it
passes the goal then for the stretch goal I will contact artists to draw images
for the game and magicians for the background music. Together we can raise this
project to reach everyone’s expectations.</p>

<p>Let’s be fair for a moment. Indiegogo is always a gamble.
There is a big chance that I won’t reach my goal. If this is the case then I

<p>""I will never forget my first encounter with the Cosmic Compass and its creator, Aline Hanle. I was at a dramatic crossroad juncture in my life and felt so confused about how to move forward. Aline invited me to ask my deepest questions and allow the Cosmic Compass process to reveal the truth. I was stunned by the accuracy of the answers which came forth during that session. My life has unfolded in beautiful ways since then and I am grateful for the clarity and confidence which emerged from the fog after this experience.""</p>

<p>""It’s not often that I’m speechless.  However, that’s exactly what I was after I turned over my first card in the game (Well, after a few choice words that basically conveyed shock and awe).   Why speechless?  Because the card revealed the very thing that I had been hiding from for decades. The very path my soul most feared – using a gift I have been blessed with; however, one that does not “fit” within the carefully chosen structure of my life.  But, in the moment the card was shown, I knew I could no longer deny it, for my very inquiry was, “How do I find meaning in my life right now?”</p>
<p>Is the game life changing?  Only if you want it to be.  That’s what I loved.  The game merely reveals what your soul wants you to know – it’s still your life and you are still in charge.  The game is truly and brilliantly inspired, of that, I have no doubt.</p>

I’m very left brained and want to win every game I play, especially board games. At the beginning of the game I won’t lie, I was really disappointed about lack of points and scoring only to find out that I was instantly being challenged with certain beliefs and thoughts. Then it got REALLY weird and powerful when the other people playing the game with me started to help me see and understand my strategy and get me “home”. Aline has a gift of reading people and helping you find your own“answers”. When people ask me about it, it’s hard to explain, the words that come to mind are “magic” and “mind blowing”.

What it does for you is to help you make sense of who you are, what you need to focus upon and even how to do it!The Cosmic Compass Game is your ultimate “Life Coach” in the box. I’m on the seventh version, or “alpha” / “beta” version  and the first sets of the game I made by hand have already changed hundreds of people. You can read the typical feedback I get after people play the game for the first time below.





My wish is, for the Cosmic Compass to spread its wings even more, touch many more people and transform many more lives.
For that, I wish to publish the next version of the Cosmic Compass Game Box so that it becomes available for thousands!!
I wish for you to own your very own NEW and ENHANCED Cosmic Compass Game so that you can impact yourself and all your family and friends, at home. I also wish to make the Cosmic Compass an essential and celebrated experience for EVERYONE!  Children, parents, grand-parents, spouses, entrepreneurs or corporate employees and others  can experience this innovative form of enlightening entertainment to find resolutions through clarity and guidance!
How do we do that? 
We designed the first EVER Enlightened Soiree... 
Now you wonder... what is an Enlightened Soiree?


The Enlightened Soiree
It’s not only entertainment, It is Enlightened Entertainment
The Enlightened Soiree is an entertaining and innovative concept for girls night IN!
We, girls, wanna have fun! (Thank to Cindy, she told us what we wanted..).
Unlike Cindy, I am not only telling you what you want, I am offering it to you with a twist of enlightenment!
Think about this…
What do you want to offer to your greatest girlfriends?

A different kind of evening. Something unique, unexpected and mind-blowing!
A space for them to enjoy themselves as women.
The time of their life filled with connection and support.
Memories they will forever cherish.

More than anything, you want them to remember YOU as the one who made a difference in their life because of THAT very Evening…
We got it for you and it is called “The Enlightened Soiree”.
Simple yet revolutionary, you, now, have the opportunity to be a Catalyst for Greatness in your life and the life of those you love and all of that while having fun!
The Enlightened Soiree is a women networking mixer that brings girlfriends closer to each others.
Started in 2008 in Austin Texas, and designed by  Aline Hanle, a French Life Coach living in Austin, TX, the Enlightened Soiree Kit is an At-home girlfriends Party package that offers the first Life Coach in a box (literally!).
We know you are intrigued.. (We are too.. and we already know what this is all about! Imagine!!).So, really.. beyond the fun we will all experience and the transformation, we will live, here is, in short, what this vision is all about...

In short, together we can make magic and shift global consciousness towards more kindness, more compassion, more inner-responsibility because we all become more aware of our own journey on Earth.




   What We Need & What You Get Here is what we need to spark that vision!  $6000 for Package Design, Manufacturing, shipping and handling of 250 game boxes 
Here is what YOU get:

Fun and practical perks that will help you grow greater such as



A 33-day Prosperity Challenge
My Passion Manifesto
A personalized Cosmic Insight
The NEW COSMIC COMPASS GAME VERSION
Private game and mentoring sessions with me!









   The Impact

Slowly and surely, the game has grown its notoriety because each and every person who has played has had his/her mind blown by the unique strategy it uses and the endless positive ripple-effects it has on one's life.
What People Experience:

Powerful Insights about your Life.
A renewed sense of directions.
A revived sense of personal power and confidence.
A greater clarity about your purpose and true desires.
A crystal clear path to overcome your self-sabotaging patterns, conflicts and challenges.
An amazing experience of connection and personal transformation.

Imagine now the impact this can have within a family, a community, a group, a nation!! It is all about understanding oneself better so that we can all serve greater.Risks & ChallengesSo you may wonder... Why has she waited 7 years to make her BIG move?Well... Walk your talk, first, says the wise...I needed to do my own journey into greatness before I was able to fully share it with the world. It has been a 7 year walk , for me, to embrace my dream and find the courage to show it... I had to find the balance between the visionary entrepreneur, the feeling-inadequate mama, and the French person on foreign soil (Thank God for choosing the land of opportunity to learn courage, strength and limitless possibility!).



What Players have to say

""I will never forget my first encounter with the Cosmic Compass and its creator, Aline Hanle. I was at a dramatic crossroad juncture in my life and felt so confused about how to move forward. Aline invited me to ask my deepest questions and allow the Cosmic Compass process to reveal the truth. I was stunned by the accuracy of the answers which came forth during that session. My life has unfolded in beautiful ways since then and I am grateful for the clarity and confidence which emerged from the fog after this experience.""

""It’s not often that I’m speechless.  However, that’s exactly what I was after I turned over my first card in the game (Well, after a few choice words that basically conveyed shock and awe).   Why speechless?  Because the card revealed the very thing that I had been hiding from for decades. The very path my soul most feared – using a gift I have been blessed with; however, one that does not “fit” within the carefully chosen structure of my life.  But, in the moment the card was shown, I knew I could no longer deny it, for my very inquiry was, “How do I find meaning in my life right now?”
Is the game life changing?  Only if you want it to be.  That’s what I loved.  The game merely reveals what your soul wants you to know – it’s still your life and you are still in charge.  The game is truly and brilliantly inspired, of that, I have no doubt.

I’m very left brained and want to win every game I play, especially board games. At the beginning of the game I won’t lie, I was really disappointed about lack of points and scoring only to find out that I was instantly being challenged with certain beliefs and thoughts. Then it got REALLY weird and powerful when the other people playing the game with me started to help me see and understand my strategy and get me “home”. Aline has a gift of reading people and helping you find your own“answers”. When people ask me about it, it’s hard to explain, the words that come to mind are “magic” and “mind blowing”. The best part is that the game and your strategy changes each time you play. Really, you just have to play this game.

The game-related digital painting will be included as a print for backers who will receive the softcover copies of the book. <b><u>We would also be able to afford to translate the book into Russian, Polish, German, Brazilian Portuguese, and Spanish.</u></b></p>
<p><b>$9,300</b></p>

<p>But that's not all!</p>
<p>Add to that five (5!) more video game case studies, with the games chosen and voted on by the contributors of any tier. Curious how that would work in practice? Check out the <a href=""https://plus.google.com/+TyroVogel/posts/GDCTrXNvzXx"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Google+ vote</b></a> for choosing the title of this book, in which more than 150 people had chosen to go with <b>Video Game Writing by Video Game Writers</b>.</p>

There are dozens of books about video game writing out there. But as somebody who's had a chance to work on a couple of titles, I can tell you that it's not the theory that counts; it's the practice. Which is why it's surprising that nobody had interviewed professional video game writers in a single book, magazine, or web page, asking them, in extensive detail, about the process of writing the actual games that they'd worked on.
This is such a book.Here is the line-up of the games that this book will cover (as per the confirmed video game writers as of May 17, 2016):
Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon
Choice of the Vampire
F.E.A.R. First Encounter Assault Recon
FTL: Faster Than Light
Gemini Rue
Guild Wars 2
Half-Life

Royal Trouble: Honeymoon Havoc
Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2

Different genres, different approaches, different technologies, different teams ... the only thing these games have in common is that somebody wrote their scripts.
I, for one, would love to learn what these writers have to say about the work that went into the process.

Let's say you're interested (fingers crossed)! What do you get for supporting this project? First of all, a top-notch quality book that will be available for free to everyone as a digital download after the crowdfunding is complete, and softcover copies to all backers at Game Master level and above.
Most of the funds will go to finance professional layout, formatting, and the printing and mailing of softcover copies to backers ... all delivered within 3 months from hitting the funding goal.

Work
To be able to release the project within 3 months of hitting the funding goal, I would have to dedicate at least 2 months of my life to it. I'm a freelance writer, which means that it's time spent not working on anything else ... $600 a month is the absolute minimum I need to support myself and my family during that time.

Other
These are IndieGoGo fees together with payment processing fees; a cumulative average of 10%.





No crowdfunding is complete without stretch goals, so here is some cool stuff we'd be able to do if the funding exceeds the original goal.
$7,950
If we get fully funded (a stretch goal in itself!), we would commission the artist Yvan Quinet to paint custom covers for the writer contributor copies of the books. The game-related digital painting will be included as a print for backers who will receive the softcover copies of the book. We would also be able to afford to translate the book into Russian, Polish, German, Brazilian Portuguese, and Spanish.
$9,300
In addition to helping create the finest book possible, every backer at the PRO level and above will also receive a print of an original game-related painting by the Hollywood concept artist Brion Verkler.
But that's not all!
Add to that five (5!) more video game case studies, with the games chosen and voted on by the contributors of any tier. Curious how that would work in practice? Check out the Google+ vote for choosing the title of this book, in which more than 150 people had chosen to go with Video Game Writing by Video Game Writers.
$12,300
Everything above and commissioned portraits of video game writers in the .pdf and print versions of the book preceding every chapter.
Because, hey, writers are cool.
$15,000
At $15,000, you will allow me to fund an audio version of this book read by professional voice actors, made available as a free download to anyone who wants it.





What can possibly go wrong, right?
Actually, not  much. I've written and put together at least half a dozen books for my clients as a freelancer, so I've some experience in getting books done. And before I became a full time writer, I managed pharmaceutical trial IT tech at Oracle for 5 years, so I know a few things about project management and accountability ... but not everything depends on Yours Truly. 
This is a collaborative project, and what if some of those writers that I haven't contacted yet don't get back to me, or what if they're too busy to participate?
It's a valid question, but let me put it this way: Drew Karpyshyn didn't write Mass Effect alone.
And in the case I fail to secure any of the writers on one of the games, as improbable as that seems, I'll change the lineup and include a few other titles instead as long as their writers are good to go. It's the successful funding of this project that will prove that people are interested in such a book, so if the funding goal is met, I'm sure persuading the writers to contribute is not going to be a problem. And, once again, some awesome writers already agreed to participate months ago.



But what if the funding goal is not met? As sad as such an outcome would be, preparing for the worst is a sound strategy. 
Depending on the funds raised, I will still create the book (as such a book should exist), with the following differences:


No custom art for the cover
No professional proofreading, layout, or editing
No (or fewer) translated versions
It will take longer to put the book together

January 2010 most of Haiti was ravaged by a massive earthquake that killed more
than 230,000 people and made 1.3 million people homeless, the majority of whom lived below the poverty line. The earthquake also reduced much of the capital and surrounding
countryside into rubble. Five and a half
years later, there isstill 25 million
tons of rubble spread over the island. This rubble is a real
killer. It’s world’s largest polluter in volume, it’s destroying the
environment and it’s a health hazard for the people who are forced to live
among it.</p>

<p><b>What is the

<p></p>
<p><b>The Mobile
Factory i</b><b>s a mobile sustainable solution that uses an
innovative approach to the problem of rubble in Haiti. By transforming rubble
into a new resource. </b>It fits into two shipping containers and can be sent to any location where there is rubble, hence the name. Crushed rubble goes in at
one end, is processed into liquid concrete, and eventually comes out the other
side as brand new concrete building blocks. These are designed so that you
simply need to stack them. Just like Lego. The new blocks allow victims of
natural disasters to construct their own new, safe and affordable, earthquake
proof houses, schools, hospitals or businesses. In short, the Mobile Factory
helps them rebuild the communities they lost.</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""></span></p><div>

25kg to produce 1 building block. The remaining 100 kg, which we call
granulate, is used to strengthen infrastructures, build cellars, water
collection systems, and most importantly, earthquake proofing the ground on

<p><b>Reusing rubble is such a simple solution. How come it
doesn't already exist?</b>Funny you should
ask. We were wondering the same thing when we started. The basic technology
that the Mobile Factory uses, that of reconstituting rubble, has been around in
Holland for over 20 years. But it was only being used in industry, for example,
to build industrial walls and those giant blocks that you see when driving past
roadworks on the highway. We simply asked  ourselves: ""How can we
 make'm smaller, cheaper, and easy to use?"". Obviously, there's more
to it than that, but suffice it to say that we took an existing technology and
applied it in a way no one had thought of before.</p>
<p><b>Why focus on people living below the poverty
line? <br/></b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The simple answer would be that these people need our
help the most. And they do. But it's about much more than that. For those
living below the poverty line, employment is one of the few ways in which they
can improve their living standards. Which is why we give them the skills to
build their own homes and pay them a salary, so that they can pass on this
knowledge or use it to create an independent labour and skill base.</span></p>

KurzbeschreibungEs gibt viele Sports Bars. Man schaut Fußball oder Snooker, Sport wie man ihn eben kennt.Doch ein Phänomen unserer Zeit ist ""E-Sports"", Spieler, die sich in Multiplayer Spielen messen und ganze Hallen füllen - in Turnieren mit riesigen Preisgeldern. Wieso also nicht eine E-Sports - Bar? Livestreams von Events, Turniere vor Ort und vieles mehr. In gemütlicher Atmosphäre mit Freunden oder neu-gewonnenen Menschen, die das gleiche Hobby teilen.Was du uns gibst & was du bekommst
Eine Bar in unserem Wunschstandort Heidelberg benötigt ein hohes Maß an finanziellen Mitteln zur Unterhaltung. Strom, Wasser und Miete beanspruchen einen Teil des Budgets, der aber durch die Einnahmen im späteren Verlauf abgedeckt wird. Die Größere Herausforderung besteht darin, den Umbau mit Konsolen, TV´s, Beamern Lautsprechern usw. zu finanzieren. 
Zum einen soll eine herkömmliche Bar mit nettem und gemütlichem Ambiente entstehen. Der Fokus soll aber auf das Gaming und auf den Esport gelegt werden. Mann soll die Freude an diesem Hobby mit seinen Freunden gemeinsam teilen-das ist die Idee.
Das Hauptziel ist die Bar, umso mehr finanzielle Mittel aber zur Verfügung stehen, umso mehr und vielfältiger wird die Bar ausfallen. Mit mehr Geld könnte z.B. eine größere Location angemietet werden, bei der dann beispielsweise Platz für Billardtische oder ähnliches wäre. 
Die Folgen
Es wird eine fast einzigartige Bar im deutschen Raum entstehen.
Der Spaß am Esport und am Gaming wird mit klassischen Kneipenbesuchen kombiniert.
Je mehr Leute uns unterstützen, desto größer, vielfältiger und exklusiver wird die Bar aussehen.

Summary
There are a lot of Sport Bars, where you can watch football, snooker or similar. Sport as usual.
But there is a new aera. ""Esports"" - Players who compete with each other in multiplayer online games. Large halls are filled and sold out at such events. But where's the public viewing part?
So, why not an E-Sports Bar? Livestreams, Tournaments and much more in comfortable atmosphere with friends or people who share the same hobby.
What you give & what you'll get


A bar in Heidelberg requires a high level of financial resources for maintenance. Electricity, water and rent claim a part of the budget, which is covered by the revenue at a later stage. The greater challenge is to finance the renovation and buy  consoles, TV's, projectors, etc. speakers.
On the one hand is to create a traditional bar with nice and comfortable atmosphere. But the focus should be the Gaming- and eSports - Part.
The main objective is the bar, but the more financial resources are available, the more you will get in the bar.


Consequences


There will be  an almost unique bar in southern - Germany.
The fun of the gaming- and e-sports part combined with classical pub visits.
The more people support us, the larger and more exclusive the bar will look.



Risks & Challenges


Let's be honest: For every project of this kind, unplanned costs may occur. The greater risk is not to achieve the planned su. Therefore, we are dependent on any donation, but also everything else to do in order to realize this dream.
We have a lot of friends and acquaintances who will help us with the renovation / design of the bar.
The requests to sponsors are in full swing! SteelSeries and Blizzard are one of the few representatives who would help us with this project.


Other ways to support us
Some simply can not contribute, but that does not mean that they can not help:
If you like the idea, combining eSport and gaming with pub visits, you can share our project! That's also a great help.

<h3>Meet Jack...</h3>
<p>Jack was an ordinary guy, living an ordinary life with his family in a small town called Seward, simple job, simple hobbies, happy well-balanced life. Even though he graduated summa cum laude, top of his class from biochemical engineering, he was never a careerist, a talent like him could have made huge discoveries, innovation, he could have been a rock star scientist, but he never wanted that. Just enjoy life, keep all stress on minimum, love his family and grow old.</p>
<p>But one horrible day, all his visions, all his dreams were crushed like a hammer crashes a vase, everybody lost their humanity, became some sort of ugly monsters...</p>
<p>No one really knew what happened that day... or who patient zero was, but since then 3 years have gone by, 3 years since Jack had to leave behind everything.</p>
<p>Surviving without his family, not knowing if they are still alive alone, or even worse turned to something indescribable, all those thoughts hunt him every day and every night, even for a blink of an eye... 3 years is a long time with all these questions in his heart. Always questioning himself, if he could have done more to save his loved ones, it must feel like torcher.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556259479/latrutmeqziuqpkdbqod.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>3 years ago, ""initiation day"" as we know it nowadays, Jack was busy as usual working alone in his private lab, trying to analyze remaining of thousand years old animals of some species he believed could result in a cure of diseases like Alzheimer. He was no older than 40, but really old-school guy, he only used the technology necessary for his research, but mainly he loved to store all his findings, ideas in his small notebooks. It never really occurred to him until after ""initiation day"", that a life without electricity, which definitely means no technology, may come one day, and all those old-school kind of habits are about to be handy again.</p>
<p>There was a huge light out that day long after the sun had gone down, sure, light outs were usual at that part of town, old electricity wires, rats... no more ingredient needed, but this was different, the whole town has gone black. Jack, as the always-the-calm guy kept his cool, walked out on the street to check if anyone had electricity. His lab was right on the top of a small mountain just in the middle of the city, so as he walked out, and it was instantaneously clear for him, this was something else.</p>
<p>""Maybe a power-grid failure? Or some sort of attack?"" - he was not sure, but as he looked closely down the streets, he, the-always-cool guy become so frightened, his legs froze for a couple of seconds. Large groups of people were running the same direction on nearly every street, and it was not clear why.</p>
<p>At that moment, Jack realized, this time of the day, his family must be home... he should be home, protecting them... he rushed back to his lab, grabbed his Glock, he never loved guns, but now, he thanked all gods for buying them last year after their home was robbed on a Sunday night while they were sleeping upstairs.</p>
<p>As he rushed down the streets, he had to go straight in the opposite direction of desperately escaping groups of people. Streets were filled with these groups, he had a hell of a time getting home... but he finally did it, as he turned right in their long street, there was his home. His family home. As he ran up on the stairs leading to the front door, he had a feeling developing in his stomach, something was wrong, no lights inside, of course, there was no electricity, but no candles? Nothing? And then, finally he reached the front door, it wasn't locked...</p>
<p>He rushed inside, and shouted out loud: ""honey, are you home? Dave - Jack's son, 10 years old - ""Dave! Are you home?"", no one answered, he shouted again and again while searching their home, but it was empty...</p>
<p>At that moment, standing in his son's room upstairs, he looked out the window, it was so dark, he could only see silhouettes of rushing people, and some sort of human-like things moving strangely weird in the crowd. As he tried to focus more on those creatures, he heard a loud noise from downstairs, it was the door being crushed... ""They are in, I gotta get out now!"" Jack immediately thought, maybe his wife has her phone with them. ""I call them when it's safe"".<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556259499/jzb766gwhrgfxernlzuw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Jack climbed up to the roof on the ladder which was so old, it literally crashed after each step he made upwards. As he reached the roof, something grabbed his shoulder and pushed him sideways to the chimney. It was a monster of some kind, maybe an ill human, Jack couldn't decide at the moment, but it was getting closer and closer. Slowly crawling, like it was hurt, Jack shouted: ""Stop! Or I'm gonna shoot you! Stop!"", but the monster kept coming, step by step closer to Jack's leg, it was wounded, bleeding slowly, it wasn't made by the creature, he had hit it to the pipe coming out of the chimney's side. ""One last warning, I'm gonna fu**ing shoot you! Stop!"", but it just kept coming and coming. Jack reached for his Glock, safety off, he loaded the gun with his left hand, the adrenalin just raised to a level, his vision was perfectly clear and everything was moving so slowly for him, he only needed less than a second, aimed and shot the zombie right in the middle of his forehead... At that very moment, he realized, it was a young man, turned to something indescribable... best definition would be a zombie, ""what the hell"" Jack just kept repeating the same thought. </p>
<p>After a couple of seconds of processing what just happened, he had to run faster than he ever thought he could, all the monsters heard the loud sound of his gunshot and reoriented to catch him.</p>
<p>Jack jumped off the roof of the 2-floor home,  with his already wounded left leg, and just started to run away, escape the chasing, and find someplace to reevaluate, plan the search and rescue of his family, and find out what the hell just started to be happening in the world...</p>

</div></div>","Meet Jack...
Jack was an ordinary guy, living an ordinary life with his family in a small town called Seward, simple job, simple hobbies, happy well-balanced life. Even though he graduated summa cum laude, top of his class from biochemical engineering, he was never a careerist, a talent like him could have made huge discoveries, innovation, he could have been a rock star scientist, but he never wanted that. Just enjoy life, keep all stress on minimum, love his family and grow old.
But one horrible day, all his visions, all his dreams were crushed like a hammer crashes a vase, everybody lost their humanity, became some sort of ugly monsters...
No one really knew what happened that day... or who patient zero was, but since then 3 years have gone by, 3 years since Jack had to leave behind everything.
Surviving without his family, not knowing if they are still alive alone, or even worse turned to something indescribable, all those thoughts hunt him every day and every night, even for a blink of an eye... 3 years is a long time with all these questions in his heart. Always questioning himself, if he could have done more to save his loved ones, it must feel like torcher.
3 years ago, ""initiation day"" as we know it nowadays, Jack was busy as usual working alone in his private lab, trying to analyze remaining of thousand years old animals of some species he believed could result in a cure of diseases like Alzheimer. He was no older than 40, but really old-school guy, he only used the technology necessary for his research, but mainly he loved to store all his findings, ideas in his small notebooks. It never really occurred to him until after ""initiation day"", that a life without electricity, which definitely means no technology, may come one day, and all those old-school kind of habits are about to be handy again.
There was a huge light out that day long after the sun had gone down, sure, light outs were usual at that part of town, old electricity wires, rats... no more ingredient needed, but this was different, the whole town has gone black. Jack, as the always-the-calm guy kept his cool, walked out on the street to check if anyone had electricity. His lab was right on the top of a small mountain just in the middle of the city, so as he walked out, and it was instantaneously clear for him, this was something else.
""Maybe a power-grid failure? Or some sort of attack?"" - he was not sure, but as he looked closely down the streets, he, the-always-cool guy become so frightened, his legs froze for a couple of seconds. Large groups of people were running the same direction on nearly every street, and it was not clear why.
At that moment, Jack realized, this time of the day, his family must be home... he should be home, protecting them... he rushed back to his lab, grabbed his Glock, he never loved guns, but now, he thanked all gods for buying them last year after their home was robbed on a Sunday night while they were sleeping upstairs.
As he rushed down the streets, he had to go straight in the opposite direction of desperately escaping groups of people. Streets were filled with these groups, he had a hell of a time getting home... but he finally did it, as he turned right in their long street, there was his home. His family home. As he ran up on the stairs leading to the front door, he had a feeling developing in his stomach, something was wrong, no lights inside, of course, there was no electricity, but no candles? Nothing? And then, finally he reached the front door, it wasn't locked...
He rushed inside, and shouted out loud: ""honey, are you home? Dave - Jack's son, 10 years old - ""Dave! Are you home?"", no one answered, he shouted again and again while searching their home, but it was empty...
At that moment, standing in his son's room upstairs, he looked out the window, it was so dark, he could only see silhouettes of rushing people, and some sort of human-like things moving strangely weird in the crowd. As he tried to focus more on those creatures, he heard a loud noise from downstairs, it was the door being crushed... ""They are in, I gotta get out now!"" Jack immediately thought, maybe his wife has her phone with them. ""I call them when it's safe"".
Jack climbed up to the roof on the ladder which was so old, it literally crashed after each step he made upwards. As he reached the roof, something grabbed his shoulder and pushed him sideways to the chimney. It was a monster of some kind, maybe an ill human, Jack couldn't decide at the moment, but it was getting closer and closer. Slowly crawling, like it was hurt, Jack shouted: ""Stop! Or I'm gonna shoot you! Stop!"", but the monster kept coming, step by step closer to Jack's leg, it was wounded, bleeding slowly, it wasn't made by the creature, he had hit it to the pipe coming out of the chimney's side. ""One last warning, I'm gonna fu**ing shoot you! Stop!"", but it just kept coming and coming. Jack reached for his Glock, safety off, he loaded the gun with his left hand, the adrenalin just raised to a level, his vision was perfectly clear and everything was moving so slowly for him, he only needed less than a second, aimed and shot the zombie right in the middle of his forehead... At that very moment, he realized, it was a young man, turned to something indescribable... best definition would be a zombie, ""what the hell"" Jack just kept repeating the same thought. 
After a couple of seconds of processing what just happened, he had to run faster than he ever thought he could, all the monsters heard the loud sound of his gunshot and reoriented to catch him.
Jack jumped off the roof of the 2-floor home,  with his already wounded left leg, and just started to run away, escape the chasing, and find someplace to reevaluate, plan the search and rescue of his family, and find out what the hell just started to be happening in the world...
Good luck mate!

</div></div>","The tides of evil flowed through Ethiryon, and sorrow spread like a plague among humans. Far upon the forgotten skies, the Skyward Gates were breached, unleashing the darkness within. Eleven years later, eight Magus Lords created the Hallowed Divinity; the spell that banished Aemohriel back into the depths of the Aetherworld. Pieces of remaining worlds were kept afloat by the Dim Unity, the archaic relic of Vaelyon.Ethirians forged magic artifacts protecting humankind from roaming rifts and bloodshed. Two decades have passed since the war of origins, the darkness still peering through the gates, waiting to be found. Embark on a grand journey to become a notorious Magus and put an end to an ever-lasting war.



15 hours main campaign with over 150 side quests.[...] The length of the campaign may increase but will be no lesser than 15 hours.



All decisions you make intertwine into a huge pool of variables affecting nearly every main quest and tasks available.[...] Shape your experience with the things you say and the decisions you make.



A vast world to explore filled with challenging foes and puzzles.[...] The focus is to balance combat with exploration and role-playing.



Fast paced, turn based combat with a twist reminiscent of old school RPGs.[...] Encounters are short and deadly, unleash devastating attacks and summon allies.



Thousands of customizable items, upgrades, abilities and character builds.[...] Upgrade and highly customize characters with hundreds of possibilities.



Craft and rebuild a shattered world as you make enemies and allies for the final stand.[...] There's many out of combat activities and ways to complete the game. Looking for the final boss? You might become it.



Post-game and 2 free updates with hours of additional content.[...] There's 3 major updates currently planned, they are part of the post-game and will be released at later dates. 2 of them will be free to anyone who back or purchase the game.

I've been wanting to create role-playing adventures ever since I can remember. My love for story-telling and arts compelled me to play all sort of games to escape most of my life. I've spent years learning and using softwares, what was a hobby grew into a passion. I am creating Skyward Fantasy with RPG Maker MV and JavaScript for nearly two years now. With the support of a friend and the community we pushed the limits of the engine, making this game a possibility!
I've been working very hard on Skyward Fantasy, actively developing the game while I work a full time job. I never miss a day of progress and I am highly determined to releasing this game. It is my gateway into indie game making and it's a dream I am devoted to making come true. I want Skyward Fantasy to become an experience rather than a distraction. There is more to what I would love to accomplish with the final state of the game and we need your help!

The funds will be used for:

Improved battler graphics, more enemies and visual weapons.
Original soundtrack by Toshi Clinch and Drew Zaremba.
High-definition illustrations for cut-scenes and events.
More character faces and expressions.
English Major for localization.

<p><strong>Personal Background</strong></p>
<p>I'm a 23-year-old student out of Sydney. For the past couple of years, I have always thought there are antiperspirants for other body parts, so why can't there be one for the hands? It was only recently I started looking into hand antiperspirants (when I figured there is such thing). The most common drawback with hand antiperspirants already in the market is the ingredients, ingredients such as talc. The problem with talc and similar ingredients are that they can create residue which isn't ideal for gamers and their expensive equipment.</p>

<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>My original plan was to personally invest in the first order and test the market. However, after getting in contact with multiple manufacturers around the world, I realised I wouldn't have the funds to do so. GetGrip is a unique formulation, which means the manufacturers must purchase the raw ingredients in bulk resulting in large MOQ's usually 20kg to 50kg.<br/>My goal is relatively small. All I'm looking need is enough funding to create my first order. $12 per unit</p>
<p>30kg = 30,000 ml</p>

<h2><u>SubterAlien Rescue. </u></h2>
<p><strong><u>Introduction.</u></strong></p>
<p>I have always been fascinated by computer graphics and video games from the very first time I saw TRON on the big screen. The first time I played Defender in the arcades. I was hooked on creating CG and becoming a CG artist in the games industry.</p>
<p>I have worked for small, medium and ‘AAA’ studios since 1995.  Studios such as Psygnosis, Bullfrog in the UK. I went on to work for Electronic Arts, Acclaim, Midway, Kuju, Koei Japan and Asylum Entertainment. I emigrated to work for EA Canada in their PSP division. My experience, knowledge and skillsets are well suited to deliver this game to the market.</p>
<p>I’ve been a game artist and developer on 24 game projects and have a credit for artwork on 16 published games. Titles include. Tiger Woods PGA, Need for Speed Carbon, Pogo Island, Theme Park World, Track Attack, Need for Speed Pro Street, plus many more.</p>
<p>We have a small but very experienced team that have worked in the game industry for at least 10-25 years each.</p>
<p><u><strong>SubterAlien: Rescue Game Demo: -</strong></u></p>
<p><a href=""https://tigersharkstudios.ca/subteralien-rescue"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u><strong>https://tigersharkstudios.ca/subteralien-rescue</strong></u></a></p>
<p><strong><u>SubterAlien: Rescue Project.</u></strong></p>
<p>I've always found the story to games I liked, limited. This posed me with what if questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>What if the lunar lander ship had weapons like in Defender or R-Type<ul style=""list-style-type:circle;""><li>We have designed a unique set of upgrades that will give your ship awesome firepower.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>What if we had to rescue downed pilots like in Choplifter ?<ul style=""list-style-type:circle;"">
<li>Pilots will run towards you for rescue or bases for shelter from enemies.</li>
<li>Pilots can also help enhance your ship with salvage tech</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What if precious minerals in the catacombs could be extracted as a resource for technology.</li>
<li>What if we had crazy alien mechanical robots after us?<ul style=""list-style-type:circle;"">
<li>The robots are aliens from another galaxy intent on mining our resources</li>
<li>Robots hunt our pilots and will attack our bases to hamper your rescue efforts</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions led me to combine features and ideas from some popular arcade and computer games into this project.  Collaborating with my colleagues  and good friends in the industry, we created SubterAlien Rescue. </p>
<p><strong><u>The Roadblocks.</u></strong></p>
<p>The initial game design was to create levels based on our Solar systems planets, moons and asteroid fields in the game. The proof of concept is complete.</p>
<p>With our campaign funding levels met, we can hire key staff for the completion of the game. Having professional experienced programmers, artists, animators and audio technician will ensure completion of the game on time and successful launch of SubterAlien: Rescue to the Steam and other online market platforms.</p>
<p><strong><u>We Need your Help.</u></strong></p>
<p>With your help and support we can deliver: -</p>
<p>20 levels of challenging game play</p>
<p>Arcade and story modes to the game</p>
<p>Unique weapons inventory and ship upgrade system</p>
<p>25 Original designed Alien Robot enemies</p>
<p>Challenging game level environmental puzzles.</p>
<p>If you could use the Indiegogo share tools to share our content on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and other social media sites, this will help us gain additional support and raise game awareness. We appreciate your support.</p>

Introduction.
I have always been fascinated by computer graphics and video games from the very first time I saw TRON on the big screen. The first time I played Defender in the arcades. I was hooked on creating CG and becoming a CG artist in the games industry.
I have worked for small, medium and ‘AAA’ studios since 1995.  Studios such as Psygnosis, Bullfrog in the UK. I went on to work for Electronic Arts, Acclaim, Midway, Kuju, Koei Japan and Asylum Entertainment. I emigrated to work for EA Canada in their PSP division. My experience, knowledge and skillsets are well suited to deliver this game to the market.
I’ve been a game artist and developer on 24 game projects and have a credit for artwork on 16 published games. Titles include. Tiger Woods PGA, Need for Speed Carbon, Pogo Island, Theme Park World, Track Attack, Need for Speed Pro Street, plus many more.
We have a small but very experienced team that have worked in the game industry for at least 10-25 years each.
SubterAlien: Rescue Game Demo: -
https://tigersharkstudios.ca/subteralien-rescue
SubterAlien: Rescue Project.
I've always found the story to games I liked, limited. This posed me with what if questions.

What if the lunar lander ship had weapons like in Defender or R-TypeWe have designed a unique set of upgrades that will give your ship awesome firepower.

What if we had to rescue downed pilots like in Choplifter ?
Pilots will run towards you for rescue or bases for shelter from enemies.
Pilots can also help enhance your ship with salvage tech


What if precious minerals in the catacombs could be extracted as a resource for technology.
What if we had crazy alien mechanical robots after us?
The robots are aliens from another galaxy intent on mining our resources
Robots hunt our pilots and will attack our bases to hamper your rescue efforts



These questions led me to combine features and ideas from some popular arcade and computer games into this project.  Collaborating with my colleagues  and good friends in the industry, we created SubterAlien Rescue. 
The Roadblocks.
The initial game design was to create levels based on our Solar systems planets, moons and asteroid fields in the game. The proof of concept is complete.
With our campaign funding levels met, we can hire key staff for the completion of the game. Having professional experienced programmers, artists, animators and audio technician will ensure completion of the game on time and successful launch of SubterAlien: Rescue to the Steam and other online market platforms.
We Need your Help.
With your help and support we can deliver: -
20 levels of challenging game play
Arcade and story modes to the game
Unique weapons inventory and ship upgrade system
25 Original designed Alien Robot enemies
Challenging game level environmental puzzles.
If you could use the Indiegogo share tools to share our content on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and other social media sites, this will help us gain additional support and raise game awareness. We appreciate your support.

And so you have been chosen by your Goddess, given the ability to use your strength of will as a weapon to possess your enemies after disrupting their connection to the Hive Mind. With this power, your goal is to confront the Hive Mind and free the people of the island from its control.Over the course of the game, you'll meet a lot of fun and interesting NPC's, like our wonderfully adorable shopkeeper, who will send you various upgrades and blueprints as you progress through the game. In future updates, there will likely be additional characters that will greater engage the player within the game's world. Thank YouThank you so much for taking time out of your day to listen to us show off what we've been working on.

<b>Resurrection: </b>By using an ancient artifact, the bones of an ancient wizard, the player has the ability to bring him/herself back from the dead. This is not merely a way to avoid death so as to make the player invincible to his his/her enemies. Far from it. Each puzzle in the game depends on the player's ability to die and come back from the dead. In each level the player will notice that some walls and platforms are transparent/ghostly. While the player is alive, he/she will be able to pass directly through these objects. But when the player dies, he/she collides with these ghostly objects while passing through the solid ones. Instead of being a punishment for failure, in this game, death becomes a means to an end.</li></ul><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""257"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/MA-bThKChEw?feature=oembed&amp;wmode=transparent"" style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline;"" width=""456""></iframe></div><p></p><ul><li>
<b>Time Travel:</b> The player also has the ability to travel back in time. Imagine if Marty McFly knew that, in the future, he would travel back in time and visit his past self. By knowing this ahead of time he would have been able to cooperate with his past self to accomplish what would otherwise be impossible. In Transcend, you will do just that. In levels that feature the time travel mechanic, the player will be called upon to complete the level once while anticipating what his/her future self will do, then again while cooperating with his/her past self. This mechanic is accomplished by recording the game pad inputs from the player and playing them back on a clone of the player. Such an approach allows for advanced game play by slightly altering the level as the player returns to it a second time. </li></ul><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""257"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/9bPqOmtuxkM?feature=oembed&amp;wmode=transparent"" style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline;"" width=""456""></iframe></div><p></p><ul><li>
<b>Colored Keys and Doors:</b> Navigation through the world map is done in a unique way. Colored lines connect levels together indicating to the player which colored door he/she will have to enter in order to go to the desired level. The player will also have the option to combine two different primary colors of key and door in order to change the door's color to the required secondary color. For example, if the player sees that the next level he/she needs to navigate to is accessed along a purple line, the player will need to find a red key and bring it to a blue door in the previous level. See the example below.</li></ul><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/498/258/f44483ebe7feabc00fbe1c18df89ce41_original.png?v=1427268246&amp;w=700&amp;h=&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=7304488bc0f90a4f84b938d34d8f36a5"" src="""" style=""""/> </figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><br/></figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><h1>Budget</h1></figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;"">We already have everything we need to finish this game except for time and money (which are pretty much the same thing!) If we are able to reach $150,000 we will be able to devote our full attention to this project without the added distraction of having to work at a job to put food on the table. This amount would allow us to set up a local office where we can work full time on this project. Our current goal, however, is more modest than that so we are hoping to exceed it. The team currently consists of two people, Brian and Chris. Brian Programs. Chris draws. They both design the game. This is the same set up that Team Meat had when they built Super Meat Boy and Polytron had when they built Fez. In both cases, however, the developers were working full time. If we are able to reach our modest goal of $60,000 but not $150,000, we will still be able to work on this project and bring it to completion, but we would be doing so in spite of the fact that we would not have removed our problem of having one of us only working part time.<br/></figure><p></p><p></p></div>","Want to play the game before you decide to contribute?

Resurrection: By using an ancient artifact, the bones of an ancient wizard, the player has the ability to bring him/herself back from the dead. This is not merely a way to avoid death so as to make the player invincible to his his/her enemies. Far from it. Each puzzle in the game depends on the player's ability to die and come back from the dead. In each level the player will notice that some walls and platforms are transparent/ghostly. While the player is alive, he/she will be able to pass directly through these objects. But when the player dies, he/she collides with these ghostly objects while passing through the solid ones. Instead of being a punishment for failure, in this game, death becomes a means to an end.
Time Travel: The player also has the ability to travel back in time. Imagine if Marty McFly knew that, in the future, he would travel back in time and visit his past self. By knowing this ahead of time he would have been able to cooperate with his past self to accomplish what would otherwise be impossible. In Transcend, you will do just that. In levels that feature the time travel mechanic, the player will be called upon to complete the level once while anticipating what his/her future self will do, then again while cooperating with his/her past self. This mechanic is accomplished by recording the game pad inputs from the player and playing them back on a clone of the player. Such an approach allows for advanced game play by slightly altering the level as the player returns to it a second time. 
Colored Keys and Doors: Navigation through the world map is done in a unique way. Colored lines connect levels together indicating to the player which colored door he/she will have to enter in order to go to the desired level. The player will also have the option to combine two different primary colors of key and door in order to change the door's color to the required secondary color. For example, if the player sees that the next level he/she needs to navigate to is accessed along a purple line, the player will need to find a red key and bring it to a blue door in the previous level. See the example below. BudgetWe already have everything we need to finish this game except for time and money (which are pretty much the same thing!) If we are able to reach $150,000 we will be able to devote our full attention to this project without the added distraction of having to work at a job to put food on the table. This amount would allow us to set up a local office where we can work full time on this project. Our current goal, however, is more modest than that so we are hoping to exceed it. The team currently consists of two people, Brian and Chris. Brian Programs. Chris draws. They both design the game. This is the same set up that Team Meat had when they built Super Meat Boy and Polytron had when they built Fez. In both cases, however, the developers were working full time. If we are able to reach our modest goal of $60,000 but not $150,000, we will still be able to work on this project and bring it to completion, but we would be doing so in spite of the fact that we would not have removed our problem of having one of us only working part time.",3.0,2,"2 Campaigns

<p>The question you may be asking is, why is CCD important? Why have we created this game? The truth is, CCD is something that affects all of us. Honey bees are dying at an alarming rate.

Because of this, we here at Colmena strongly believe that educating and engaging people about the topic is essential to taking care of our communities. We hope that our game will help inspire those who play to learn more about CCD and honey bees, and that they take this knowledge to help create a better world. </p>
</div>
<p>This game has been in the works since our first project bought us together, our book <i>Einstein &amp; The Honeybee: An Introduction to Game Design and Game Development</i> (available to buy on Amazon). We are very excited to bring this game not only to you, the public, but to educators as well. This brings us to you and why you’re here. By donating and sharing our campaign you will help not only support our growing company, but you will also help spread awareness about CCD. Why is this important? Because every person who is aware of the issue is another person who can do something to affect change. Groups such as New York City Public Schools (River East Elementary), The Boys Club New York City, NYC BeeKeepers Association, El Puente Bushwick, and Picture the Homeless Reference Library will benefit from your generosity today. Your donation today will not only help these groups and others, but it will support our growing company dedicated to creating positive change in our communities and it will help support the bees!

<p><span>
Physics based contact detection is introduced for all Kamae (guards/stances)
and moves. Unlike many other games, one won't be able to press a single button

and seize advantages in a fight, players need to make proper moves according to
his/her opponent's attacks all the time.</span></p>

<p><span>
<b>No life bar nor health point</b> in this game! Similar to the Bushido Blade
series, with a single hit one can disable or even kill his/her opponent. On the
other hand, precise physics based contact detection of the weapon and the
variety of balanced fighting skills will significantly enhance the viability of
the fighters, preventing Hatashiai from becoming a boring seckilling game.</span></p>

Players of
fighting games that want something different but serious
Martial arts
and melee weapon enthusiasts
People who
have an interest in samurai, ninja or history
                                      To best capture
the quintessence of Kenjutsu, this game is designed to include the following
features: 

Cultural & Historical Accuracy 

Includes at least eight famous Ryuha (shcool of Kenjutsu) with utterly
different fighting styles. All skills and moves are actual techniques
developed and used by the ancient Samurai/Warriors. All characters are legendary
martial artists who have left glorious names in history.
　　
    

* Characters
with weapons other than swords (e.g. spears, naginata or even harquebuss, etc.)
will be added as non-controllable NPCs first, and afterwards made accessible to
the players when their skills/moves are well balanced.


Pure physics based Sword Contact Detection 

Physics based contact detection is introduced for all Kamae (guards/stances)
and moves. Unlike many other games, one won't be able to press a single button
to block most of his/her opponent's attacks anymore. To make effective defenses
and seize advantages in a fight, players need to make proper moves according to
his/her opponent's attacks all the time.
        
One-Hit Kill
Fighting System 

No life bar nor health point in this game! Similar to the Bushido Blade
series, with a single hit one can disable or even kill his/her opponent. On the
other hand, precise physics based contact detection of the weapon and the
variety of balanced fighting skills will significantly enhance the viability of
the fighters, preventing Hatashiai from becoming a boring seckilling game.

      


Weapon
customization
Weapons can be
customized in detail in Hatashiai. You can freely swap in and out each part of
your weapon (e.g. blade, saya, tsuba, habaki, seppa, tsuka, etc.) Note that
swapping parts is about more than just the looks, it can affect your
performance in a combat in different ways.


Feudal
japan-themed environments

Enjoy the beautiful scenery and stylized architectures of feudal Japan.


                                 Release version
1.0 will include the following modes:

Single-player
Story mode
for at least 20 controllable characters
Practice mode
in which you fight against AIs with real sword or non-lethal wooden sword
Local
multi-player 
1P vs 2P mode
Online
multi-player
1 vs 1 mode

 P.S. : Online multi-player modules enabling players to fight in field operations or castle
siege tasks are also inside our future plan (as a future update after the game released).

Void of Heroes is a combination of the mobile 3D online battle arena shooter game and our comic series sharing the same title. Void of Heroes game will be made available to Amazon Android, Google Play and iOS App store during 2015. The comic will be launched in the US by Cosmic Times in July. The comic and game share the same plot, characters and environments but function as stand alone products (comics: experience the past battles / game: take part to the current and future battles). The linkage between these two products is a redeem code reward system accessible by purchasing paperback comics that include the redeem codes. The collectible paperbacks are home delivered via Amazon internationally and they unlock unique in-game rewards. The system has been designed so that it's not necessary to purchase the comic (pay-to-win) since mostly the redeem campaigns provide cosmetic and game experience improvements, making the game more fun.<br/>

battling inside huge coolant pipe filled massive machinery, to desolate 
high-rise futuristic suburban areas, to overgrown hydroponic gardens 
etc. Our goal is to keep the environments interesting and different, 
even with the gameplay being underground. <br/><br/><h4>What type of controls will be used in Void of Heroes?</h4>The
 standard controls are the normal console type controls for mobile, with
 an auto fire system to make Mobile gameplay more fluid. You can add a 
trigger to the screen if you do not want to use the auto fire. Possible 
Desktop releases will use the keyboard mouse configuration which is 
pretty much industry standard for most shooter games. Gamepad support 
will be featured at release or shortly after. <br/><br/><h4>Can I play with friends in Void of Heroes?</h4>Yes
 you can! Void of Heroes will have a teaming-up with friends system, and
 later a clan system will be added in for more organised grouping and 
battling. <br/><br/><h4>What languages will Void of Heroes support?</h4>Initial release will be in english, additional languages will be added ASAP.<br/><br/><h4>How will vehicle/mech progress work in the game?</h4>To
 access better equipment and more powerful mechs/vehicles, you will need
 to gain experience by participating in player versus player matches and
 playing through the single player campaign. This will mean that the 
most powerful machines will not be available at the beginning of the 
game. <br/>More details of the progression system will be revealed in a future article. <br/><br/><h4>What playable characters will the game feature?</h4>Current
 plans is for Mechs, vehicles and some “bio-machines” and mech 
bio/machine hybrids. You can read the comics to get a forewarning of 
what’s coming! ;) <br/><br/><h4>How many players will there be per team in the PvP system?</h4>We are trying to get as many in as the minimum spec system will allow, we are looking at including up to 6 players per team. <br/><br/><h4>What kind of rewards can we look forward to for teamwork in PvP and in general PvE content? </h4>In
 PvP the focus is on teamwork to bring down enemy players. Vehicles are 
quite resilient, so it will take a few shots to take them down, so going
 alone will leave you at a disadvantage if you get caught out. <br/>In 
PvE the rewards come from dealing with the environment and challenges 
presented therein, mostly in forms of enemy packs, wanderers and bosses.
 We are looking into a PvE co-op gameplay mode as well, which might get 
added in at a later stage. <br/><br/><h4>Will vehicles have special abilities, or perks?</h4>Every
 vehicle, every pilot and every suit a pilot wears comes with it’s own 
set of skills/ablities and stat bonuses. Playing with the combinations 
of these leads to a great variety of abilities, and when added to the 
different weapons available to the mechs and pilots, creates a truly 
unique playground for creating very interesting and powerful 
combinations.<br/><br/><h4>How will mech variants be integrated into the game.
 Will they be in trees, or lines or how does it work? Can you upgrade 
directly to end tiers, or do you have to go through a set of vehicles?</h4>In
 Void of Heroes, you have mech manufacturers and lines(though the end of
 the line is not always manufactured, but something that evolved…), and 
their mechs are set in tiered lines, so you choose a manufacturer, spend
 your earned experience and credits to research the tech, and then 
purchase the mechs, in order to be able to unlock the next one in the 
tree. There will be special vehicles outside of the trees, like specials
 from the comics, premium vehicles etc…<br/><br/><h4>How I can receive important information about updates and offers etc by mail?</h4>Sign up/subscribe for the newsletter for gamers, or check our Facebook, Twitter, Blog, Instagram, youtube or our site <a href=""http://www.voidofheroes.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.voidofheroes.com</a><br/></div>","Choose your pilot, take control of a mech, and suit up with your choice of battle harness to create the ultimate combination of battlefield dominating warmachine. 
Update 2! Check out VoH gameplay footage filmed during our testing. We found out some minor issues that are now being fixed. The launch date will be postponed until we have the fixes done and tested, stay tuned and support us on our journey!

Update 1! Take a look at the KV1-N Main Battle Mech gameplay, piloted by Kevin, the original go to driver of the K-Industries mech line. 

Stay tuned for more gameplay vids from the other mechs in the game!
Create the trinity of war: the mech, pilot and suit. Tweak the abilities of each component, and create combinations to rule the battlefield.
Void of Heroes is a combination of the mobile 3D online battle arena shooter game and our comic series sharing the same title. Void of Heroes game will be made available to Amazon Android, Google Play and iOS App store during 2015. The comic will be launched in the US by Cosmic Times in July. The comic and game share the same plot, characters and environments but function as stand alone products (comics: experience the past battles / game: take part to the current and future battles). The linkage between these two products is a redeem code reward system accessible by purchasing paperback comics that include the redeem codes. The collectible paperbacks are home delivered via Amazon internationally and they unlock unique in-game rewards. The system has been designed so that it's not necessary to purchase the comic (pay-to-win) since mostly the redeem campaigns provide cosmetic and game experience improvements, making the game more fun.


This campaign has been launched for speeding up the pace. The funding will be used for 1) product development, 2) starting up multiplayer servers and 3) adding a ton more content and mechs for you(and us) to play with. Your contribution will directly improve our mission to scale up the multiplayer back end by setting up a dedicated server infrastructure as well as enable us to quickly provide more multiplayer (PvP) and single player (PvE) content with semi-authoritative (PAAS) and continuing to server authoritative (IAAS) cloud based infra. 
  
 We are seeking a total of 100 000 Euros 1) for the server infrastructure and 2) further development of our multiplayer game. The core developers have 15 to 30 years experience on back end, client/server, testing & QA technologies and have developed similar systems before. We do not invest into user acquisition (UA) since we have partnered in relevant areas (US, Asia, and MENA region) to gain visibility (e.g. Comic Cons), comic purchases and game downloads (large scale partners). 
 In return for your contribution, in addition to our eternal gratitude and your name in the credits,  we have created a awesome selection of Perks that provide access to the servers you help to set up, collectible comics, merchandise and miniature models as well as unique in-game rewards! Check them out in more detail in the below images! We have the basic building blocks already in place, the first version with peer-to-peer multiplayer will be launched in July. -Updates to follow during the campaign...














Our campaign is all about bringing something we love to life. This is where you guys and gals come in. Our goal is to have the 
dedicated servers up and running by Christmas 2015, as well as fully 
fleshed out mech lines, to bring our vision of a strong arcady mech 
multiplayer system available. The Void
 of Heroes experience has everything that's needed of becoming a phenomenon, combining paperback comics and free to play online games. Void of Heroes has been developed by a six person core developer team including talent from comic book publishing, game design, programming and start-up development.





Jukka is a serial entrepreneur with Industrial- and strategic design masters degree, focusing mainly on 3D modeling, animation and front end programming (UI/UX). Jukka has a vast experience on product development and start ups.





Tapio has a creative background in industrial design, concept design, 3D and comics. Tapio is the lead Void of Heroes game and concept designer having extensive and competitive gaming background.




Topi has worked as a comic book artist in the comic industry for over 10 years and been involved in several published comics such as Punainen Kobra, Korkeajännitys and Aku Ankka (Finnish Donald Duck).



Jari has 30+ years back end programming, client & server experience from large (e.g. Tieto, Nokia, EDS) and smaller Finnish ISV companies.  In his free time, Jari brakes games into exel sheets...


Joni has 15+ years experience of testing & QA infrastructure and -programming from companies such as Qualcomm, AMD Finland, ATI Finland, Bitboys. Joni is also a heavy weight game cosumer.




Christian is a professional level programmer and game enthusiast, currently finishing his studies at Aalto University - Game development program.

3D graphics, VFX and gaming enthusiast for 20+ years. 
Participates in competitive gaming and closely follows the eSports 
scene. Has a Bachelors degree in IT and has completed a comprehensive training program 
in game development.

  
 Our main challenge is to get dedicated servers running to upgrade our current peer to peer multiplayer system, and make the mulitplayer experience more solid and less prone to network quality variance, also allowing for server calculations of functions, lessening the load on the client end.  
Our secondary challenge is to push out enough content and playability for gamers to enjoy the game even more, which means more mechs, battle arenas, PvE content and overall optimization. 
We made a quick demo video to show the meta game (as mentioned earlier, -Create the trinity of war: the mech, pilot and suit). The demo also shows that we combine mech- and human levels on the PvE front. Keep in mind that this video was made using a very early demo build that was made for testing the basic functionality of the game. A lot of polishing has happened since, also having focus on the multiplayer. -Similar features will still remain on the launch build of the game. -Stay tuned!

You survived a crash of a cargo ship and stranded on a deserted island. In order to survive the local wilderness you must explore the island, gather resources, craft items and build a shelter. With our blueprint system you can create a multitude of items and buildings. See something of interest on the island? Draw it on the map with our map system. Each player is able to draw his or her own maps and playing coop with friends? You can share your own drawn map! The whole idea about the game Raft is exploration, you are not stuck on one island. Build a raft to sail the vast ocean and find other island, because resources are limited on every island and who knows what you will find on your journey? Each island is different in many ways.

In our current financial situation, we are having exponentially less time to develop this project to focus on making ends meet in our personal lives.

<p>By funding Wormhole City you are giving the opportunity and freedom for independent designers to pursue a chance in making their passions a full-time career. Extra funding will go towards programmers, voice actors and artists who have helped or want to expand on Wormhole City. All contributors and backers will be recognized in Wormhole City's in-game credits. Wormhole City will launch on PC with Mac and Linux releases shortly after. With our stretch goals we hope to bring Wormhole City to consoles in the near future.</p>
<p>While designing Wormhole City, we have been involved with a development team of an upcoming asset to the Unreal 4 marketplace and achieved in creating a first-person demo with Oculus Rift compatible gameplay, available to download here:</p>

No one has to act busy on their fun anymore. They are busy, with everyone in the room :)The lead developer made (Pistol Instructor Marksmanship Program 2 a.k.a. PIMP2) on his down time while serving on active duty working, and going to school full time, while raising 3 kids. Now as a civilian with a 9-5, he's got this.I guess we are doing this all with the hope that the pastime of board games can be reinvented. We want to say goodbye to our phones being a distraction during quality time, yet instead an outlet to one heck of a good time :)Risks & ChallengesThere are a few hurdles being faced. Such as hiring the right developers, completing the insane logic necessary to manage all the variables in play that has made it take so long to get to this point. We have been and will continue to solve the math and logic problems that stand in our way. Tchaikawsky is a Lean Six Sigma Black Belt (fancy way of saying, ""really good at using statistics to make things work well""). He is a developer. He studied art for a year at the Art Institute of Washington and was a Marine that partied in Japan and NYC for his excusable 20's. If there was ever a man suited for managing and contributing to the talent necessary to make this happen, He is our man. Likewise, the team as shown artistically in the image above is diverse and fun loving. We have a lot of new and interesting challenges planned for everyone.We have a logic tree that list all of the task we have left to complete. If there comes an issue too difficult for anyone to solve we hire help using freelancers and contractors.Other Ways You Can HelpFor some of you that can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:Please share a link to our website www.GetPLayeDApp.com having the newest product on the market has a host of its own challenges. We have to build up a reputation and a brand. With your single act of sharing, it can have exponential results! Please use the Indiegogo share tools!

<h2>A Quick Introduction:</h2>
<p><i><strong>Aquamare</strong></i> is a <u>Platform</u> anime style game project using the <i>Unreal Engine</i>. Developed for the<strong> PC</strong> <strong><i>and Mac</i></strong> platforms, featuring amazing <u>3-D</u> <i>characters</i> with a great story. Discover a wonderful world with characters like <strong>Nayda</strong>, our main character, who is kind but she has a short temper and can get very angry at times and make some <strong>really</strong> bad decisions.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What The Story is About,</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477339875/gtwazscyt3zblgttuil3.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>Nayda</b> is a <i>mermaid</i>  that lives on a trapped reef. Having lived in the shelter of the reef for a <u>very long time</u>, she feels the need to look for her <strong>""kind""</strong>. And now she<i> finally understands</i> that she must become strong in order to leave the shelter. While living in the shelter she ""finally"" learned about her kind and her birthplace...<i><strong>Atlantis</strong></i>.</p>

<p><br/>We are working on a <strong>new type</strong> of<i> gaming</i> experience combining 2 different type of <i>game</i> genre. Imagine a fuse with <strong><i>Katamari </i></strong>and <i><strong>Assassins Creed</strong></i> with a <strong>GREAT</strong> story. Our goal is to have this <i>game </i>released on Steam...we will also have an option for you to have a normal profile background on Steam and also one of those cool custom animated backgrounds as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Meet The Team:</h3>
<p>1.- Tirso H. Project Manager.</p>
<p>2.- Roberto H. Project Manager.</p>
<p>3.- Miranda S. Modeler and Graphic Design.</p>
<p>4.- Salvador M. Modeler.</p>
<p>5.- Rodrigo N. Graphic Design.</p>
<p>6.- Santiago M. Music and Public Relations.</p>
<p>7.- Ricardo T. Promotion strategy.</p>
<p><br/><br/><strong>Get to know the Characters:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.- Nayda, </strong></p>
<p>A <i>mermaid</i> with a big imagination <u>but</u> a very short temper. There is a <b>struggle</b> inside of her...good vs. evil. She will <u><i>generally</i></u> be kind except when put into danger. Her ""monster"" side can emerge and cause <i>mayhem</i> to the player .</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479929984/j2vfoc952mwkczonkssh.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>2.- Skeptic Eye,</strong></p>
<p>A <i>funny </i><strong>villain</strong> full of jokes and puns about eyes. In secret he tests <strong>Nayda</strong> all the time to develop her skills. ***But there is also ""<strong>The</strong> <strong>Skeptic Eye</strong> <strong>Skepticism</strong>"" that <strong>Nayda</strong> has about Skeptic Eye, but it will help her to grow in both being able to hone her skills, in both behavior and interaction and to be able to advance in the harder levels, but most of all to help her make it home.***</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480352790/ocennocvj4goieyqrrq0.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>3.- Bluewatt,</strong></p>
<p>Some sort of <i>seafox </i>with <u>mermaid</u> like features. <strong>Bluewatt</strong> is the only friend <strong>Nayda</strong> has known for a long time in the reef. <strong>Bluewatt</strong> is a character linked to hard work, chivalry and a developers satirical comparison. He likes <strong>Nayda</strong> and believes in her<i> good nature</i>, but worries of her ""monster"" side.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>4.- Aquaneko,</strong></p>
<p><i>Any catfish</i> should have the chance for a good <u><i>home</i></u> and coral to sharpen its claws. <strong>Aquaneko </strong>lives in the reef and has a big family in the ocean.<i> He knows</i> all the secret caves to exit the hidden reef. He will have <u>good stories</u> and some other tales the more <strong>Nayda</strong> and him get along.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>5.- Syrup,</strong></p>
<p>She is some kind of feminine medusa with a really <u>short term<strong><i> </i></strong></u><i><strong>""fish"" memory</strong></i>. <strong>Nadya</strong> considers her to be a good friend even though Syrup never seems to remember her.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Plot,</strong></h3>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477253237/rij1tllhwuqjy9dne9br.png"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The story unfolds by keeping <strong>Nayda</strong> on her good side while clearing the <u>levels</u>. She must eat<i> fish</i> to gain <u>weight</u> and to <i>grow</i> in <strong>size</strong>, she must reach a certain <strong>size</strong> to escape the reef. There is a big <i>fish</i> blocking the only exit and <strong>Nayda</strong> can't use any of the secret passages that <strong>Aquanekos</strong> uses, so she must defeat the <strong>gigantic</strong> <i>sea</i> <u>tormentor</u> to finally escape.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Feeling,</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477339937/tll4rwi3y5na0wxaegax.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The <u>theme</u> will be a quite relaxing and cheerful <strong>underwater </strong><i>style</i>. There will be twists to it when <strong>Nadya</strong> gets <u>mad</u> and <strong>attacks</strong> the player. So by making <u><i>mistakes</i></u> in the game the <u>mood</u> can <i>change</i> from cheerful to quite<i> dark </i>and tense.</p>

<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>resources</strong> will be well <u>spent </u>into making better<i> models </i>and <i>animations</i>. The <i>coding</i> is also a <u>big expense</u> especially if we want to get better <strong>mechanics</strong> into the<strong> game</strong>. Those elements <i>really </i>make a big difference for a better quality gaming experiences.</li>
<li>The more <strong>funding</strong>, the more we can work on details like, <u><i>artificial intelligence</i></u> for enemies and more quests.</li>
<li>Consider each pack <u>carefully</u>, you could end up <i>developing</i> something with us that could be of <strong><u>great use</u></strong> later .</li>
<li>If we don't reach our goal most likely the <strong>game</strong> will be much shorter. Also we <u>believe</u> in NOT having to sacrifice <strong><u>quality</u></strong> over quantity. </li>

<h3>Impact,</h3>
<p>In short, we have a team that together has more than <strong><i>10 years </i></strong>of experience. We have worked on smaller <strong>games </strong>before but nothing as <strong>big</strong> as this.</p>
<ul>
<li>This <i>project</i> opens a new path for <strong>development</strong> and we would love to share it with you!</li>
<li>The first <u>campaign</u> is ALWAYS the<strong> hardest</strong>. We have made other <u>campaigns</u> on different sites.</li>

Aquamare is a Platform anime style game project using the Unreal Engine. Developed for the PC and Mac platforms, featuring amazing 3-D characters with a great story. Discover a wonderful world with characters like Nayda, our main character, who is kind but she has a short temper and can get very angry at times and make some really bad decisions.
 
What The Story is About,

Nayda is a mermaid  that lives on a trapped reef. Having lived in the shelter of the reef for a very long time, she feels the need to look for her ""kind"". And now she finally understands that she must become strong in order to leave the shelter. While living in the shelter she ""finally"" learned about her kind and her birthplace...Atlantis.
 
Demo and Greenlight:

 

 
 
Credentials:

The Unreal Engine is a very powerful game development tool. We are using the Unreal Engine to make our game .

Blender is a 3-D modeling software that we use on the daily basis. We use blender to make most of our assets .
 
So What is AquaMare?

We are working on a new type of gaming experience combining 2 different type of game genre. Imagine a fuse with Katamari and Assassins Creed with a GREAT story. Our goal is to have this game released on Steam...we will also have an option for you to have a normal profile background on Steam and also one of those cool custom animated backgrounds as well.
 
Meet The Team:
1.- Tirso H. Project Manager.
2.- Roberto H. Project Manager.
3.- Miranda S. Modeler and Graphic Design.
4.- Salvador M. Modeler.
5.- Rodrigo N. Graphic Design.
6.- Santiago M. Music and Public Relations.
7.- Ricardo T. Promotion strategy.
Get to know the Characters:
1.- Nayda, 
A mermaid with a big imagination but a very short temper. There is a struggle inside of her...good vs. evil. She will generally be kind except when put into danger. Her ""monster"" side can emerge and cause mayhem to the player .

 
2.- Skeptic Eye,
A funny villain full of jokes and puns about eyes. In secret he tests Nayda all the time to develop her skills. ***But there is also ""The Skeptic Eye Skepticism"" that Nayda has about Skeptic Eye, but it will help her to grow in both being able to hone her skills, in both behavior and interaction and to be able to advance in the harder levels, but most of all to help her make it home.***

3.- Bluewatt,
Some sort of seafox with mermaid like features. Bluewatt is the only friend Nayda has known for a long time in the reef. Bluewatt is a character linked to hard work, chivalry and a developers satirical comparison. He likes Nayda and believes in her good nature, but worries of her ""monster"" side.
 
4.- Aquaneko,
Any catfish should have the chance for a good home and coral to sharpen its claws. Aquaneko lives in the reef and has a big family in the ocean. He knows all the secret caves to exit the hidden reef. He will have good stories and some other tales the more Nayda and him get along.
 
5.- Syrup,
She is some kind of feminine medusa with a really short term ""fish"" memory. Nadya considers her to be a good friend even though Syrup never seems to remember her.
 
Plot,

 
The story unfolds by keeping Nayda on her good side while clearing the levels. She must eat fish to gain weight and to grow in size, she must reach a certain size to escape the reef. There is a big fish blocking the only exit and Nayda can't use any of the secret passages that Aquanekos uses, so she must defeat the gigantic sea tormentor to finally escape.
 
Feeling,

 
The theme will be a quite relaxing and cheerful underwater style. There will be twists to it when Nadya gets mad and attacks the player. So by making mistakes in the game the mood can change from cheerful to quite dark and tense.

Why the Founding?
Looking at things in more detail :

 

The resources will be well spent into making better models and animations. The coding is also a big expense especially if we want to get better mechanics into the game. Those elements really make a big difference for a better quality gaming experiences.
The more funding, the more we can work on details like, artificial intelligence for enemies and more quests.
Consider each pack carefully, you could end up developing something with us that could be of great use later .
If we don't reach our goal most likely the game will be much shorter. Also we believe in NOT having to sacrifice quality over quantity. 


 
Impact,
In short, we have a team that together has more than 10 years of experience. We have worked on smaller games before but nothing as big as this.

This project opens a new path for development and we would love to share it with you!
The first campaign is ALWAYS the hardest. We have made other campaigns on different sites.
Your help will make the difference!



 
Risks & Challenges,

Up to this point our risks are low. We have all of the hardest elements working and that has our spirits high.

The complicated movement scripts are 100% finished.
We have 100% of the music finished.
The first level is 100% complete.

Coding is done for first levels and there are no bugs.
We have a wide selection of enemies and can add intelligence to them .

<h3>About Anointed Game</h3>
<p>Welcome to the Indiegogo campaign for<strong><i> </i></strong><i>Anointed: Chronicles of Laftu:</i> a ""whack-a-mole"" style video game based on the challenges of <i>Laftu</i>; a teenager who discovers the ultimate power present in the pages of the Bible, and uses his newly found authority and positivity to tackle all the challenges confronting him his community. <i>Laftu’s</i> adventure begins at <i>Asie</i>; his remote hometown in West Africa which is riddled with poverty, disease and terror. He soon realizes that through faith in the word of God which gives him courage to confront the challenges in his community, he is able to conquer all evil.</p>

<p>Anointed: Chronicles of Laftu relies on a fun and quality gameplay allied with scripture affirmation; ”Touch not my anointed, do my prophet no harm” (1 Chronicles 16:22). The mechanics are very simple; just tap/ click on an emerging enemy as fast as you can to repel them. Put on the whole armor of God (Ephesians 6:11) and stand as Laftu against evil. Equip protective gear such as the Shield of Faith and Belt of Truth. Attack your enemies with the words contained in the Bible which show as a ray of bright yellow light.</p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Anointed has been one of the most fun times of our lives! After several months of bootstrapping by our studio, we released  a functional beta version of Anointed: Chronicles of Laftu in October 2017 on Google and IOS stores. Since then, we've been lucky enough to have our game featured on <strong><a href=""http://www.pulse.ng/bi/tech/chronicles-of-laftu-a-nigerian-developer-has-produced-africa-s-first-bible-based-game-id7792399.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pulse</a></strong>, <strong><a href=""http://www.africanews.com/2017/12/26/nigerian-develops-christian-game-app-sci-tech//"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Africanews</a></strong>, <strong><a href=""http://www.everythingdigitalmedia.com/episode/yinola-com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Everything Digital</a></strong>, and more!</p>
<p>This crowdfunding will help us to get this game across the finish line!  With your generous support we can complete the development, improve the art, publishing and other game components needed to officially launch Anointed to backers in June 2018 and others in July 2018. With your backing, together we can create an incredible mobile, social and web experience where families all over the world can enjoy Christian games – this release will be available for iOS, Android devices, Mac, Windows and Facebook. We would be truly grateful for your support - and we have great rewards to give out too. Please see below. What are you waiting for? Let's <strong>#PlayAnointed</strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>How will this work?</strong></h3>
<p>We know that asking for money for a Mobile game is a big ""ask,"" so we are trying to give you as much as we can back, by releasing our games for free and offering lots of cool stuff.  This is kind of like you giving to us, and we give back to you; or paying forward.  Another way to think of it is that you are paying a discounted price for something you wanted anyway, and we're throwing in some extra gifts to say thank you for your help.  Here is the chart of perks you can get when you contribute:</p>

<h3>Laftu</h3>
<p>The story surrounds a teenage boy called Laftu and his sister who grew up in a foster home in a remote town called Asie. Short of confidence and in a sticky situation, Laftu is visited by an Angel who echoes the promises contained in the Holy Bible and this Angel becomes Laftu's guide throughout this adventure. This enables Laftu to see deeper into the power contained in the Holy Bible which he uses to summon powerful and exciting boosters to repel his enemies. Over the course of the adventure, Laftu’s sister will be introduced; categories of this Indiegogo campaign will give backers the opportunity of naming Laftu’s sister and creating new characters.</p>

</div></div>","About Anointed Game
Welcome to the Indiegogo campaign for Anointed: Chronicles of Laftu: a ""whack-a-mole"" style video game based on the challenges of Laftu; a teenager who discovers the ultimate power present in the pages of the Bible, and uses his newly found authority and positivity to tackle all the challenges confronting him his community. Laftu’s adventure begins at Asie; his remote hometown in West Africa which is riddled with poverty, disease and terror. He soon realizes that through faith in the word of God which gives him courage to confront the challenges in his community, he is able to conquer all evil.
 

 

Anointed: Chronicles of Laftu relies on a fun and quality gameplay allied with scripture affirmation; ”Touch not my anointed, do my prophet no harm” (1 Chronicles 16:22). The mechanics are very simple; just tap/ click on an emerging enemy as fast as you can to repel them. Put on the whole armor of God (Ephesians 6:11) and stand as Laftu against evil. Equip protective gear such as the Shield of Faith and Belt of Truth. Attack your enemies with the words contained in the Bible which show as a ray of bright yellow light.


What We Need
Anointed has been one of the most fun times of our lives! After several months of bootstrapping by our studio, we released  a functional beta version of Anointed: Chronicles of Laftu in October 2017 on Google and IOS stores. Since then, we've been lucky enough to have our game featured on Pulse, Africanews, Everything Digital, and more!
This crowdfunding will help us to get this game across the finish line!  With your generous support we can complete the development, improve the art, publishing and other game components needed to officially launch Anointed to backers in June 2018 and others in July 2018. With your backing, together we can create an incredible mobile, social and web experience where families all over the world can enjoy Christian games – this release will be available for iOS, Android devices, Mac, Windows and Facebook. We would be truly grateful for your support - and we have great rewards to give out too. Please see below. What are you waiting for? Let's #PlayAnointed.
How will this work?
We know that asking for money for a Mobile game is a big ""ask,"" so we are trying to give you as much as we can back, by releasing our games for free and offering lots of cool stuff.  This is kind of like you giving to us, and we give back to you; or paying forward.  Another way to think of it is that you are paying a discounted price for something you wanted anyway, and we're throwing in some extra gifts to say thank you for your help.  Here is the chart of perks you can get when you contribute:


Laftu
The story surrounds a teenage boy called Laftu and his sister who grew up in a foster home in a remote town called Asie. Short of confidence and in a sticky situation, Laftu is visited by an Angel who echoes the promises contained in the Holy Bible and this Angel becomes Laftu's guide throughout this adventure. This enables Laftu to see deeper into the power contained in the Holy Bible which he uses to summon powerful and exciting boosters to repel his enemies. Over the course of the adventure, Laftu’s sister will be introduced; categories of this Indiegogo campaign will give backers the opportunity of naming Laftu’s sister and creating new characters.




Weapons & Boosters
The primary weapon is the Bible. It emits bright rays of light used to repel the evil ones. It is also used to summon various boosters and power-ups via Angels .


Villains
We can all agree that the world will be a better place to live without vices such as: bullies, terrorists, diseases and poverty. It is important to reiterate to children and adults that prayers and positive thoughts and actions will help tackle and limit the effect of these vices on families and communities all over the world.The upcoming game release will include 3 main villains which include: Poverty, Disease and Bully. Our stretch goals will include additional villains like Terror and Sky Dragon; however, as part of our community, please suggest other suitable villains for this project.

We've had a blast designing material rewards to contain things we imagine would interest you, and we have some leads to ensure that anything we ship to you will meet our standards.
Here are the perks on offer:

Our artists have created hi resolution screensavers and wallpapers showing the creative process and giving you a glimpse into the Anointed in-game characters. You may also get printed version of these screensavers as wallpapers for your home.

Our team includes a talented music composer who has created awesome soundtracks that play in the background of our game. You get full versions of these gospel worship instrumentals that will soothe you and help you meditate.

Laftu’s adventure begins at Asie; his remote hometown in West Africa. The Asie climate suits Laftu in ways inexpiable; it listens to his fierce footsteps, the clicking of his shoes against its dirty pavements early in the morning. Asie saw him smile ear to ear until the villains arrived. Map of Asie is the game map for Anointed: Chronicles of Laftu, backers will receive printed versions of the map.
This cool adhesive art sticker fit on your cellphone, laptop, car bumper, refrigerator and other surfaces. You'll get a pack of 6 which means you can share these cool stickers with friends.

A beautiful digital book showing the several in-game characters and events, this also doubles as a personal notepad. Your notepad will be specially issued in your name and signed off by Laftu.

Our character sequences fit so well on colorfully designed t shirts, these are available in many sizes, designs and colours (your choice).

The Danshiki is an essential trendy street wear that needs to reside in your wardrobe. This is a classic earthy t-shirt with African print and patterns. Laftu wears a yellow Danshiki for most parts of the game #BeLikeLaftu

Many ideas grow better when transplanted into another mind than the one where they sprang up. What will you name Laftu's sister? This perk earns you the right to name this character and others..

<h3>Hello!<br/> </h3>
<p>My name is Christopher Speciale and I am the lead software engineer at Dimensionscape LLC. Dimensionscape is a small software company with a passion for building video games and tools.</p>
<p>Growing up playing legacy indie games such as first star online and building our own games with the sources of its many iterations was a fundamental part growing up and getting into game development for a few of us at the company. Unfortunately, the game and the available sources are built and maintained with a dead software building platform powered by Shockwave. Shockwave not only remains a dangerous option for creating software due to its numerous and crippling security vulnerabilities, but there are also no legitimate ways to obtain it's primary authoring tool, Adobe Director. On top of all that, developing or editing shockwave content with director is grueling, difficult and most often results in poorly performing applications.</p>
<p>Second Star aims to kill two birds with one stone by not only bringing FSO to a completely new platform, but also improving on customization and performance of the engine in terms of front-end experience without having to delve into scripts and code.</p>
<p>Games will have the option of being published in 32 bit or 64 bit native code and the all new server architecture will allow for the same on windows, linux, or macOS.</p>
<p>Not only will Second Star boast optional 64 bit support and run on C++ at it's core, it will fully utilize the graphics pipeline of your system hardware to give the best possible performance on every machine.</p>
<p>Both client and server will support a robust and powerful scripting language based on the ECMA-262 standard called DimensionScript that allows full access to the internal API's that power each of these two main components of the engine's toolkit.  By design however, creators should feel confident in being able to build highly functional games based on the FSO series with only the user-friendly tools that are planned to be bundled alongside the engine.</p>
<p>The available tools that you'll find with the Second Star engine will enable everything from game customization to server and asset management, updater integration and much more  as support for the project grows.</p>
<p>The Second Star engine will not stop at just allowing the creation and porting of FSO based games, but will go on to enable the development much more, with features and options based on community feedback and results.</p>
<p>The best part of Second Star is the ability to ditch director and shockwave multiuser server and take control of your own games without the hassle and steep learning curves of confusing software. Because it is so intuitive and user-friendly, we hope it will enable more people to elevate their own ideas and designs by bringing them to life with ease and freedom you just couldn't get with Director and the source-code.</p>
<p>In April, Adobe officially ended support for Shockwave on Windows. Since then we have been concerned about what this might mean for FSO on future operating systems and devices. With Second Star, no one will ever have to concern themselves with this again and the engine will be free forever.</p>
<p>Porting FSO to a new technology has been something people familiar with the games have been proposing for many years and now there is finally a team willing to make this ambition a reality with the support of the community pushing behind them.</p>
<p>Every contributor will gain access to beta and experimental versions of the Second Star engine as they're available from the development team. If we don't reach full funding, we will continue on with the project, albeit at a slower and less direct pace, possibly leaving out extra or special features and expanded development as time and resources allow. Simply put, the more funding we get, the better we can make Second Star, and ultimately, the faster we can deliver it into the hands of eager developers.<br/><br/>Our longtime experience with FSO, its sources, graphics and overall properties combined with our expertise in multiplayer game and tool development leaves us well positioned in order to fully deliver on the Second Star concept.
