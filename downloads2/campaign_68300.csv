CommUnity Life Travel Mapping</u></b></p>
<p>Global CommUnity will provide advising
services and interactive digital Life Travel Map tools that will help individuals
and families with young children to smartly plan and map out key journeys over
many years.  Clients can choose between
no-cost online resources to map and plan trips themselves or engaging a trained
advisor who will interview the family and develop a multi-year detailed plan of
key trips planned for specific years and dates based on the ideal time to visit
destinations and the recommended ages of children visiting the destinations.</p>
<p>In the interview process, the family
members will identify their most important cultures, destinations and
interests, enabling the team at Global CommUnity to prioritize and schedule
recommended trips.</p>

Engagement Materials</u></b></p>
<p>Global CommUnity seeks to prepare
travelers before the journey, so that they are engaged and knowledgeable about
the destination before the trip begins. In a world where attention spans are
short and distractions are many, these engagement tools will help parents,
children and individuals learn and get excited about these once-in-a-lifetime
trips and the cultures they’re about to experience.</p>
<p>For traveling families with children 10 years
old or younger, the child will receive a hand-made doll made to look like a
typical child living at the destination for the trip, as well as a booklet that
tells the story of the child. The doll and the storybook will result in young
children better understanding the destination and their peers there. Of course,
parents will learn from the doll and story too.</p>

will provide fun social media posting content that will subliminally also teach
the teenager things about the destination as they post for their friends and family

these social media tools won’t fight for attention against teens’ obsession
with social media.</span></p>
<p>For the whole family, Global CommUnity
will provide digital downloads of movies, books, recipes, music and recommended
local-community activities that are meant to help bring the family together to
take time to learn about the destination before the trip and best prepare their
minds and hearts for the amazing experiences that await them.</p>

CommUnity Founders</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Global CommUnity founders Christie
Holmes, Keith Waldon and Bryan Glatt have more than 35 years of experience in
the travel business, and all three have incorporated travel as key elements of
their childrens’ upbringing.  Keith and
Bryan founded an innovative travel agency called Departure Lounge in Austin,
Texas, in 2013, and Christie joined their travel advisor team.  Quickly they were disappointed in the
packaged travel options for younger families that were focused on raising
global citizens.  So many travel
providers were focused on baby-sitting or kids club options and not focused on
enriching experiences designed for the whole family and customized based on the
age of the children.  That frustration
led to dreaming of what options would be great, and those dreams led to the
concept of Global CommUnity.</p>

<p><b>Why
We Need Your Help</b></p>
<p>Global CommUnity’s founders have spent
the past year interviewing and selecting on-the-ground travel partners (the
very best) at more than 25 global destinations and working with them to design
very special itineraries.  They’ve also
sourced the technology needed to assist with the Life Travel Map service,
designed the pre-trip engagement materials (including dolls for more than 25
destinations along with story books that tell a child’s story at the
destination), selected the digital download materials, and created and
trademarked the Global CommUnity brand.  </p>
<p>We need funding to purchase the needed
inventory of materials, design and pay for launch marketing, and assist with
first-year operational costs.  If you can
assist us by donating to the Indiegogo options, we would be so thankful, and
every donation includes a great item PLUS a gift certificate you can redeem
when you reserve your first Global CommUnity trip.  For most options, the gift certificate
enables you to get the full amount of your donation back.  </p>
<p>If you are not in a position to donate,
we’d still love your help spreading the world about Global CommUnity.  We could have sought venture capital funding
for Global CommUnity, but that route did not feel right.  This brand and its unique offerings should be
built as a community effort by those who share our vision.</p>
<p><b>What
We Ultimately Want To Achieve</b></p>
<p>We know it sounds ambitious, but we want
to change the world . . . for the better. 
We are sickened that in 2016 such strong evidence of racism and hatred
of other cultures is prominent in our mainstream media, social media and
political campaigns.  We strongly believe
that the way to change this sad situation is through travel and fostering
opportunities for our children and ourselves to experience other cultures, put
faces with them and ultimately celebrate differences instead of fearing or
hating them.  So we want to make
international travel easier and less daunting. 
We also want to help people make practical long-term plans to achieve
their mission of creating global citizens of themselves and their children.</p>
<p><b>Let’s
Ink Your Support!</b></p>
<p>Celebrating diversity is made very
stylish with this handmade Global CommUnity pen made with 13-hand-turned exotic
woods from all over the world. This beautiful conversation piece is yours with

What
Is Unique About Global CommUnity?
Global
CommUnity Life Travel Mapping
Global CommUnity will provide advising
services and interactive digital Life Travel Map tools that will help individuals
and families with young children to smartly plan and map out key journeys over
many years.  Clients can choose between
no-cost online resources to map and plan trips themselves or engaging a trained
advisor who will interview the family and develop a multi-year detailed plan of
key trips planned for specific years and dates based on the ideal time to visit
destinations and the recommended ages of children visiting the destinations.
In the interview process, the family
members will identify their most important cultures, destinations and
interests, enabling the team at Global CommUnity to prioritize and schedule
recommended trips.
Cheers!  Enjoy The GlobalCommunity Corkcicle Tumbler
With a $60
contribution, receive this 24-oz Corkcicle tumbler that features the Global
CommUnity logo.  It keeps cold beverages
cold for 9 hours maintains hot beverages for 3 hours, and it’ll be a
conversation starter to talk about the importance of travel.  You also receive a $60 gift certificate
toward any Global CommUnity trip you reserve at www.NoOneIsForeign.com.
Pre-Trip
Engagement Materials
Global CommUnity seeks to prepare
travelers before the journey, so that they are engaged and knowledgeable about
the destination before the trip begins. In a world where attention spans are
short and distractions are many, these engagement tools will help parents,
children and individuals learn and get excited about these once-in-a-lifetime
trips and the cultures they’re about to experience.
For traveling families with children 10 years
old or younger, the child will receive a hand-made doll made to look like a
typical child living at the destination for the trip, as well as a booklet that
tells the story of the child. The doll and the storybook will result in young
children better understanding the destination and their peers there. Of course,
parents will learn from the doll and story too.
Be
A Doll & Get A Doll!
With a $100 contribution, you can pick a
Global CommUnity doll and storybook from Italy, India, China, Peru or South
Africa.  Plus you receive a $100 gift
certificate you can apply to any Global CommUnity trip you reserve at www.NoOneIsForeign.com.


For teenage travelers, Global CommUnity
will provide fun social media posting content that will subliminally also teach
the teenager things about the destination as they post for their friends and family
to discover they will soon be going on a special trip. Sneaky but effective,
these social media tools won’t fight for attention against teens’ obsession
with social media.
For the whole family, Global CommUnity
will provide digital downloads of movies, books, recipes, music and recommended
local-community activities that are meant to help bring the family together to
take time to learn about the destination before the trip and best prepare their
minds and hearts for the amazing experiences that await them.
Global
CommUnity Itineraries
For key destinations around the world,
Global CommUnity will offer private, packaged trips customized for 1) families
with young children, 2) families with teenaged children and 3) adults only, and
these will be offered in both five-star and four-star versions. Each journey
will be seven days in length with optional add-on extensions.  Each seven-day journey will include at least one
key experience of volunteering that will benefit the local people,
environment/wildlife, or cultural preservation. Each journey will provide ample
opportunities to meet and engage with locals. 
Support
Us & Deaf Children In Peru
On our Peru itinerary, you’ll have the
opportunity to assist a school for the deaf. 
Today you can make a $150 contribution, and $50 will go directly to help
make a documentary that will create awareness and drive support for deaf
children in Peru, who often face really challenging circumstances to get an
education and employment.  You’ll also
receive a $150 gift certificate you can apply to any Global CommUnity trip you
reserve at www.NoOneIsForeign.com.
Global
CommUnity Founders

Global CommUnity founders Christie
Holmes, Keith Waldon and Bryan Glatt have more than 35 years of experience in
the travel business, and all three have incorporated travel as key elements of
their childrens’ upbringing.  Keith and
Bryan founded an innovative travel agency called Departure Lounge in Austin,
Texas, in 2013, and Christie joined their travel advisor team.  Quickly they were disappointed in the
packaged travel options for younger families that were focused on raising
global citizens.  So many travel
providers were focused on baby-sitting or kids club options and not focused on
enriching experiences designed for the whole family and customized based on the
age of the children.  That frustration
led to dreaming of what options would be great, and those dreams led to the
concept of Global CommUnity.

Why
We Need Your Help
Global CommUnity’s founders have spent
the past year interviewing and selecting on-the-ground travel partners (the
very best) at more than 25 global destinations and working with them to design
very special itineraries.  They’ve also
sourced the technology needed to assist with the Life Travel Map service,
designed the pre-trip engagement materials (including dolls for more than 25
destinations along with story books that tell a child’s story at the
destination), selected the digital download materials, and created and
trademarked the Global CommUnity brand.  
We need funding to purchase the needed
inventory of materials, design and pay for launch marketing, and assist with
first-year operational costs.  If you can
assist us by donating to the Indiegogo options, we would be so thankful, and
every donation includes a great item PLUS a gift certificate you can redeem
when you reserve your first Global CommUnity trip.  For most options, the gift certificate
enables you to get the full amount of your donation back.  
If you are not in a position to donate,
we’d still love your help spreading the world about Global CommUnity.  We could have sought venture capital funding
for Global CommUnity, but that route did not feel right.  This brand and its unique offerings should be
built as a community effort by those who share our vision.
What
We Ultimately Want To Achieve
We know it sounds ambitious, but we want
to change the world . . . for the better. 
We are sickened that in 2016 such strong evidence of racism and hatred
of other cultures is prominent in our mainstream media, social media and
political campaigns.  We strongly believe
that the way to change this sad situation is through travel and fostering
opportunities for our children and ourselves to experience other cultures, put
faces with them and ultimately celebrate differences instead of fearing or
hating them.  So we want to make
international travel easier and less daunting. 
We also want to help people make practical long-term plans to achieve
their mission of creating global citizens of themselves and their children.
Let’s
Ink Your Support!
Celebrating diversity is made very
stylish with this handmade Global CommUnity pen made with 13-hand-turned exotic
woods from all over the world. This beautiful conversation piece is yours with
a $375 contribution, and you will also receive a $375 gift certificate you can
apply to any Global CommUnity trip you reserve at www.NoOneIsForeign.com.
Other
Ways You Can Help
Please help us spread the word
(hopefully while wearing one of our t-shirts). 
If you know of schools in your area that prioritize international
travel, please send us a note to info@NoOneIsForeign.com, and give us a contact person at the school.  If you know any family or family travel
bloggers, please tell them about Global CommUnity and send them to
www.NoOneIsForeign.com.  If you know
other individuals and families who will appreciate what we are creating, please
share our info with them.  If you know
anyone who would be interested in being a travel advisor in your community to
help sell Global CommUnity trips to individuals, families and through schools,
please contact us at info@NoOneIsForeign.com.

Want to print your own 3D objects? Want people like you to have access to the best technologies for foot health? Curious about 3D printing? Want to see additive manufacturing (3D printing) help reduce environmental waste? 

As a
qualified pedorthist and small business owner, my new clinic Ashfield
Orthotics: A Foot Health Clinic, Inc. is already something of a
""disruptor"" in the area of custom orthotics. Until now pedorthists or
podiatrists were typically only responsible for the assessment & design

What We Need & What You Get

To

I've done

The Impact



As a
qualified, certified pedorthist, former rehabilitation therapist and person
with a physical disability, I know how important mobility is. And we all know
how technological advances are making so much possible for so many these days.
You only need to Google 3D printing and medicine to see the results.

<p><strong>The Project</strong></p>
<p>Green technology and sustainable practices often advocate for some sort of deprivation or drastic change in living conditions with a hefty price tag. The Tiny House Movement requires a person to live in confined quarters without the luxury of personal space. Organic and regional produce can be two to three times more expensive than options at the average supermarket. Environmentally friendly construction is considerably more expensive and time consuming than conventional methods. For the typical family, these choices are not only illogical, they’re unlivable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We believe there is a better way.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Alveare team is driven by the premise that an environmentally sustainable lifestyle and the luxuries on which we rely (hot water, personal space, high-quality produce, electricity/heating) are not mutually exclusive. With proper guidance, anyone can build a home/facility that is both comfortable and good for the planet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Alveare is designed as an economically and environmentally self-sustaining campus where innovative ideas can be perfected for the wider-reaching community. We plan to build earth-sheltered housing (designed by Brian Campbell) that utilizes passive solar techniques to heat and cool the interior of the building and protect the exterior from the elements. We will also manage a full-scale nursery that encourages edible biodiversity and sustainable agriculture while also providing the community with local produce.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Community Impact</strong></p>
<p>The Alveare team wants to create a culture in which the innovations tested on the campus are easily applied to everyday life. To do so, we plan to offer several services:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Workshops on the following subjects:</p>
<p>Small-scale sustainable agriculture</p>
<p>Earth-sheltered building design and construction</p>
<p>Edible biodiversity landscaping</p>
<p>Anaerobic digester installation and maintenance</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Products for sale:</p>
<p>Plant sales from the nursery</p>
<p>Anaerobic digester installation</p>
<p>Online tutorials/videos on small-scale projects to improve your home’s efficiency</p>
<p>E-books including diagrams and instructions for each project</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We believe that the only way to make an impact in our community is to empower others through our workshops and tutorials to live economically and environmentally sustainable lives. In this way, Alveari will become a learning center, a place to grow as an entrepreneur and lover of green technology.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How will the money be used?</strong></p>
<p>Currently, the Alveare Project is still in its conceptual stage. We have been approved for a $200,000 mortgage and have marked potential sites in the Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah Valley, and the Piedmont Region of Virginia. The funds raised through this campaign will allow us to procure the site and initial building materials. The more money we raise, the more time can be devoted to the Alveari Project during the initial months of construction and design. Eventually, Bryan and Mal would like to commit to Alveari as a full-time vocation and service to the community, which will be accomplished far faster with adequate funding.</p>

 Many people are tired of the same old Douro Valley experience and want to learn about  and try new places, new flavours, new experiences in nature. 
There are more than vineyards in Douro Valley, the travellers have to eat traditional food in little traditional houses, taste wines wines in the company of the winemakers that make the wine you taste, visit the beauty of the Marão Mountains.
With our tours, you will live this region with the same intensity as the locals live and know those sites that are not on the tourist map, those experiences that only the locals know.
Watch our video to see the beauty of the Douro Valley, a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. 
You can be a local with our tours! Are you ready to start this unforgettable adventure?

  What We Need to Make this Dream a Reality? 
 We need to find people who like us, fall in love with this fantastic region and realise the importance of authentic experiences for travellers.
Our goal are for $35000 and every Dollar are important to our goal and the success of our new project. Dollar to Dollar, we will be one step closer to give travellers really outstanding experiences in the Douro Valley. 
All the money will be used for:
* incorporate the company
* pay all the licences and assurances compulsory by law
* build the website
* build the online booking system
* marketing campaign (online and offline in the hotels of the region)
* buy the van to make the transportation of the travellers
* buy material for the outdoor activities in the Marão Mountains.
Chose the Perks that fit best in you and support the business that will change the tours panorama in the Douro Valley!  
 How You Can Help? 1) Make a contribution to our campaign, help this dream come real. $1 can make the difference! 
2) You can be our ambassador and share/talk about our project to your friend in the social media (facebook, twitter, etc)

I live in Berrien County in beautiful, southwest Michigan USA.  My love of animal fiber started at my cottage in County Kerry, Ireland which is surrounded by sheep.  When I talk about ""fiber"" I am referring to the coat of wool clipped from animals like sheep, alpaca, lamas and used to make clothing, yarn, etc.  Michigan is home to more than 50 fiber raising farms.  Turning the wool into a usable form like yarn, requires skirting, washing, drying, carding, and spinning.  Often the fiber has to be shipped long distances at a high cost.  <b>Wait times between 6 months to a year </b>to get processed fiber back are common.  Many people give up and simply throw it on a campfire or in the trash.   This short fall in available service minimizes profits and wastes a valuable asset.</p>

Many business will claim to be eco-friendly, but if you really look at all the operation practices, you will find less than eco-friendly says and short cuts. For example, we will waste no food, use only eco or degradable friendly products and give all uneaten food to those in need. When you operate under a social project, you have held to a much higher standard than a regular business, so we will have not room for mistakes in our operations and culture as the slightest incident could put our brand at stake.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>My name is Niccolea Miouo Nance. I am a poet, artist, amateur fire spinner, and soon to be world traveler via sailboat. I am also a sexual assault survivor. As a poet, I have known for years that April is National Poetry Month. What I didn't know was that National Poetry Month shares April with Sexual Assault Awareness Month. This book project is my way of giving back to the world so others can survive and thrive. </p>
<p>In February and March of this year, Rachel McKibbens was doing an Indiegogo campaign for The Outlast Project to fund a tour to promote awareness of sexual assault. When she was getting closer to her goal, Rachel started posting a poetry prompt for every $100 raised and posted on Facebook and Twitter. By the end, it was OVER FORTY prompts!</p>
<p>I decided to write a poem from some of the prompts for my usual National Poetry Month poem-a-day (aka 30/30) challenge. PLUS, I decided I would make this book dedicated to The Outlast Project and give the profits to charity. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Proceeds will be divided between local women's shelters, the National Sexual </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Violence Resource Center and The Outlast Project (after which this book was named).</span></p>
<p>I contacted Swimming With Elephants Publications (a small press out of Albuquerque that does wonderful work) and made an agreement for them to publish the book for me at cost. This means only the cost of printing and shipping is deducted from the total, the rest is given to the charities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We would like to start with pre-orders of the books which will ship directly to contributors. Plus, we want to make the books available to independent retailers who are willing to consign without a percentage or at a discounted percentage. In order to do this, we need a minimum of the $1000 goal. The more pre-orders we get beyond the goal, the more we can help others.</p>
<p>As an added incentive for this campaign, the first fifty books will be individually signed and numbered as part of the pre-order printing. Also, the books will include a personal message if this campaign is fully funded!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Your contribution will make a difference in the lives of survivors across the United States (around the world if we exceed the goal and get volunteers from other countries who want to take part in this project). The funds will help finance resources for survivors, provide an outlet for healing, and in some cases help shelters provide a safe space. This is the important work that we want to do.</span></p>
</div><div> </div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The main risk is that we don't fully fund. Then NOTHING happens. This is why we need all the participation we can get from caring people like you! Every $1 and share helps immensely!</p>
<p> </p>
<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We get it. Sometimes you just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can help us by getting the word out and make some noise about our campaign by u<span style=""background-color: initial;"">sing the Indiegogo share tools!</span>

We would like to start with pre-orders of the books which will ship directly to contributors. Plus, we want to make the books available to independent retailers who are willing to consign without a percentage or at a discounted percentage. In order to do this, we need a minimum of the $1000 goal. The more pre-orders we get beyond the goal, the more we can help others.
As an added incentive for this campaign, the first fifty books will be individually signed and numbered as part of the pre-order printing. Also, the books will include a personal message if this campaign is fully funded!
 

The Impact
Your contribution will make a difference in the lives of survivors across the United States (around the world if we exceed the goal and get volunteers from other countries who want to take part in this project). The funds will help finance resources for survivors, provide an outlet for healing, and in some cases help shelters provide a safe space. This is the important work that we want to do.
 
Risks & Challenges
The main risk is that we don't fully fund. Then NOTHING happens. This is why we need all the participation we can get from caring people like you! Every $1 and share helps immensely!
 


Other Ways You Can Help
We get it. Sometimes you just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:

You can help us by getting the word out and make some noise about our campaign by using the Indiegogo share tools!

Like pointed out above: Every $1 and share helps immensely!

chances are that designing for 18+ platforms, services and media 
simultaneously isn't <i>exactly</i> your forte or favourite past-time.</b>

<p>Instead, in 1stbase, the Automated Design Assistant (ADA) is your AI designer and knows best how to deal with the many different platforms, services and media. <br/></p>

<p>If
 you are more of a control freak, you can also micro-manage ADA by going 
through each of her design suggestions and adding or removing them to suit
 your needs. </p>
<p>Alternatively, you can stimulate ADA's neural net 
directly by directly sending impulses into the different creative areas 
of her brain, to quickly nudge her in the right direction.</p>

 all the ""usual"" stuff to build systems like these. This is in addition to
 some more ""mundane"" facial and object detection algorithms.</p>
<p>It is 
very early days, but ADA is already making sense of 4000+ design 
decisions with various complex dependencies and applications. She is able to understand different styles, ""moods""/""feels"", colours and elements. She is aware of basic 
design principles such as colour theory, contrast, text and image 
placement, negative space and image content. She does all this while taking 
into account the devices/screens/media your content is rendered on.</p>

</div>","UPDATE: We just added platform #19; your content as a Telegram chatbot!



1stbase is the world's first ""Meta CMS""; one simple interface to rule them all.  

No more replicating your content across different platforms, services and media.

No more DIY design or customising templates.
No coding.

1stbase takes care of it all, instantly, real-time.




Even better, you don't have to wait because 1stbase has already 
been built.


All these could be yours as soon as this campaign is over;











Let's be honest - 
chances are that designing for 18+ platforms, services and media 
simultaneously isn't exactly your forte or favourite past-time.

Instead, in 1stbase, the Automated Design Assistant (ADA) is your AI designer and knows best how to deal with the many different platforms, services and media. 
And being an AI, she's much faster than you are! Instead of spending hours customising a template, you're done in minutes.



Not
 happy with the design? Literally tell her of any changes you need, and 
she will make them within seconds. You can preview or publish 
your new look in near-real-time, and instantly roll out your changes across your entire 1stbase presence.







 ""Can you make it look a bit more modern?"", ""It's too colourful"", ""I don't like the red"" down to ""Please move the navigation down""; they are all valid ways of expressing aspects of your design brief and helping ADA think in the right direction.
If
 you are more of a control freak, you can also micro-manage ADA by going 
through each of her design suggestions and adding or removing them to suit
 your needs. 
Alternatively, you can stimulate ADA's neural net 
directly by directly sending impulses into the different creative areas 
of her brain, to quickly nudge her in the right direction.






Rather than browsing yet another collection of 
templates and grappling with yet another DIY drag & drop interface 
for yet another platform, service or medium, 1stbase and ADA free you up to let you
 do what you are good at; running your business, blog, band or Kittens 
Appreciation Society.






1stbase's interface is incredibly quick and easy to use, and has been tested and 
perfected over three years, with real people of all ages and
 technical skills.





1stbase is feature-rich when you need it, yet tries to get out of 
your way when you don't, so you can get on with your day; everything in 1stbase was 
built for the time-poor.




It's not rocket
 science; being everywhere gets you noticed. It's an age-old, sure-fire 
way of getting your message across, employed by the big brands.Now, 1stbase lets anyone, even small brands, cast the widest possible net, so you too can maximize the amount of eyes and ears you can reach with your message.In more academic terms, 1stbase lets you cater to the unique uses and gratifications your audience may have for consuming your content on different platforms and media;Some
 people like websites, some people never want to leave Facebook, while 
some like to print off what you have to say, and some prefer to read 
your content on a Kindle. Whatever people's preferences or habits, with 
1stbase you will reach them - guaranteed. Now and in the future.






Getting noticed is one thing, but conversion is the end game. So, 
once engaged, 1stbase funnels your audience to your ""call-to-action"", 
the-thing-you-want-people-to-do, the reason why your content exists. And
 it does it on each and every platform.
It's not just people 
either; search engines too notice the comprehensiveness of 1stbase 
presences and the cross-links they generate, helping your 
rank higher, quicker.





To 1stbase, your content is literally king; it reigns supreme, dictating the 
design and functionality, and not the other way around.

There 
are no templates, pre-determined slots, blocks, fields or columns to 
fill out, nothing is pre-placed (except when best practices for a 
particular platform, service or medium dictate otherwise).






Take your brand-new 1stbase website for example; you can make your 
site into one long page with a few clicks, or you can decide to have a 
more hierarchical approach with multiple nested pages. The design and functionality adapt immediately.
Your
 content degrades gracefully if a platform, service or medium cannot 
render an aspect of your content (for example a YouTube video in a PDF 
brochure becomes a QR Code with a URL).









Conversely, your content 
will take advantage of the enhanced capabilities of a platform where 
possible (for example launch an email client, Google Maps or tap-to-dial
 if it encounters a phone number on a mobile device). 






With
 1stbase your content will ""live forever""; when a new platform, service 
or medium comes along, we simply create a new ""body"" for your content's 
""ethereal spirit"". You will instantly have a presence on that new 
platform, service or medium without ever lifting a finger or having to 
learn something new.






In addition to the current 18, we have many more platforms, services 
and media in our sights. Your Indiegogo support will allow us to bring
 your content to these too!




To make a point, we have seen to it that 1stbase effortlessly doubles as an 
on-line Commodore 64 app builder, just like 1stbase is simultaneously a website 
builder, Android/iOS app creator, Facebook app creator, PDF document 
creator, email template creator, etc.

As long as our patent-pending technology has some sort of 
storage and CPU to work with, it can style and distribute a meaningful, 
updateable experience around your content on any platform, past, present
 or future. All without bothering you with anything platform-specific, or asking you to do or learn something new.






So, in this instance that means a good bit of your content 
crammed into just a few kilobytes of memory, ready for viewing on 
microcomputer from 1982, styled by an AI from 2016. We've gone back to the 
future for you, just because we can.
Insanely cool or just plain-vanilla insane - you decide - 
but it hopefully shows how serious we are about our multi-platform 
capabilities. 






kiss* Digital Media (*keep it simple stupid) is Ivo Jager and Renée Fulton.
We're a couple from Melbourne, Australia.
That's
 right. Just two people. In a relationship. Doing this day in, day out, 
for the past 4 years. At home. Strung out on caffeine. What could 
possibly go wrong...





If 1stbase is really as mature as we say it is, why would we need your hard earned dollars?







""If you were in Silicon Valley, they'd be throwing millions at you!"" is how one of our early supporters over there summed up our situation a while ago.
- ""Yeah, nah. This is 'Straya, mate.""
We are based in Australia. And while Australia is an absolutely amazing 
country to live in, if you're not in the business of digging up rocks or
 flipping houses, funding for tech startups is almost impossibly hard to come by. Let alone funding and appraisal of tech, like 1stbase, that is just that little bit more ""out there"" and globally disruptive.
Consequently, we have only gotten to this stage by eating the proverbial noodles for 4 years, juggling credit cards and receiving small bits of investment from our friends and family.
The good thing here though, is that Aussies  - and particularly small business owners - see right through hype and empty promises. In fact, this no-nonsense attitude has been instrumental
 in shaping and maturing 1stbase and ADA. Everything is lean, optimised and field 
tested, because we had to meet the needs and expectations of real 
clients. ""Fake it 'till you make it"" simply does not apply here.
Failure to deliver, would have directly meant not eating our 
delicious nutritious noodles the next month. Trust us - that is a very 
powerful motivator to build something that works and delivers the goods.
Fast forward to 2016; every small business that joined us over the years is still with us today.







As the saying goes, ""necessity is the mother of invention"". ADA too is 
the product of our Australian environment; lack of qualified VCs, manpower, terrible upload speeds and unstable Internet connections. 
We endeavoured to replace a real designer with a cloud-based AI, because it
 was the only way a small team in our situation could put so many users onto 18 different platforms, services and media. She had to work - to us ADA is a necessity.In a nutshell, 1stbase didn't just come out of nowhere, we just come from a land Down Under. And now now are ready to take on the world!


We
 have gone as far and as fast as we could on a shoestring budget and 
caffeine-fueled skeleton crew of 2, but now we're ready to realise 
1stbase's potential in a big way.


Most of the work in making 
1stbase scale and supporting a large user base has been completed. After
 delivering the keys to our 1st-wave backers when this campaign  is over, we will use your support to finish off the last few
 ""boring"" bits (e.g. on-boarding, account management), as well as 
more/better/updated documentation, and support. This will allow us to 
roll out the second beta wave.
In the medium term, we would like 
to vastly improve our feature set on the various platforms, and we 
would love to make ADA truly shine on some of these as well.
Following that, we would like to keep ADA up to date with the latest design trends and expand her repertoire and abilities.
Lastly,
 we have many more ideas for new platforms and re-purposing your content
 - all instantly available to you and your new(!) audience as soon we 
release them; 
100% of your support will be re-invested into furthering 1stbase; supporting 1stbase is an investment that will keep on giving!






ADA was simply the best 
tool we could come up with to get a job done; making sense of simplified
 design briefs in order to consistently style 18+ vastly different 
services, platforms and media at once. She was not conceived as a marketing vehicle or gimmick.







 
Is ADA ""real AI""? If you care about these things, we use common AI algorithms, constructs and data models, such as artificial neural networks, RiveScript (a more elegant AIML), graph searching and constraint solving -
 all the ""usual"" stuff to build systems like these. This is in addition to
 some more ""mundane"" facial and object detection algorithms.
It is 
very early days, but ADA is already making sense of 4000+ design

design principles such as colour theory, contrast, text and image 
placement, negative space and image content. She does all this while taking 
into account the devices/screens/media your content is rendered on.
As far as us geeks go (FWIW, one of us actually studied AI at one stage), ADA is proper narrow AI. 
So, no, ADA won't become self-aware, adopt a cat and name it Spot, become 
your BFF, seduce you under false pretences or attempt to kill you if 
your surname is ""Connor"". Probably (please refer the relevant indemnity
 clauses in our terms & conditions).






However, yes, you are able
 to chat to her in plain English and (hopefully) receive relevant 
results, answers or questions back in plain English related to your design and colours.  
Whatever
 your expectations of AI are, we can tell you a little bit about the 
personal benchmark for AI that gets us excited. It's called ""emergent 
behaviour""; the magic moment when a system starts surprising you with 
things that you never explicitly taught it. ADA has shown us such moments in spades (and we've only scratched the surface!). 
More importantly to us (and you!), at the end of the day, ADA is a tool that gets a job done that is otherwise hard, costly and time-consuming.

using 1stbase for ourselves. However, please don't be mad with us for not 
maintaining a hugely active 2-way social media presence, aside from 
status updates.
You are buying into a beta, and as such we ask for your understanding
 with regards to the possible presence of bugs, glitches or features 
that, though implemented, may not yet work fully as intended. However, 
as opposed to certain other crowd funded projects, we do understand 
""beta"" to be functionally complete and fit for purpose from day one.

This is not our first gig creating ground breaking software that is used by thousands, that makes something extremely complex simple again, that is universally well-regarded and that has an active community surrounding it.

All that said, there may be a world-wide coffee shortage. In which 
case we are all absolutely stuffed, as we won't be able to get out of bed and you will lose all your money. This system was built on caffeine, and lots of it. So if that happens, 
we'll be claiming force majeure. Sorry about that...",59.0,3,"1 Campaign

<p>But Jack's Stands are on a completely different level.

financial literacy, life skills--like confidence building and being social--in
actual marketplaces that are safe, properly permitted, licensed, and fun!

And now the the Today Show! 


Lemonade stands that take credit cards? Meet the new wave of kid entrepreneurs!

My mission is to expand the number of stands and marketplaces in Colorado and beyond, to provide this great experience and opportunity to as many kids and their families as possible!  
Please join us in our mission!  What We Need Our goal is raise to $12,500 to double the number of Jack's Stands (and Marketplaces) from 6 to 12 in Colorado.  This will allow Jack's Stands to increase the number of kids who operate Jack's Stands from over 200 in 2015, to nearly 1,000 in 2016!
Let us show you how!
Costs for an additional 6 stands locally in Colorado*





The Impact

A Kaufman Foundation poll found more than half of millennials want to start a business, but that the key barriers are a lack of access to capital and a lack of knowledge. Jack's Stands' goal is to help young entrepreneurs surmount those barriers. 
In 2015, Jack's Stands hosted over 200 kids, with over 60% of them operating Jack's Stands over multiple dates.   In 2016, Jack's Stands (and Marketplaces) hopes to reach 1,000 kids (or more) to have them experience entrepreneurship, learn about business, build confidence, make some money, and have fun!  The impact that this will have on participating kids--with your support--is immeasurable.  

Risk & Challenges
Our risks are...


Can we fill all the market dates for new stands and new cities into which we are expanding?  Our previous experience, has been a 98% attendance rate and a wait list for 2016.  We're confident that we will be successful in filling all available dates at new locations.  

Can we satisfy local health, permit, and legal requirements for each locale?   Yes, we have in Colorado and through our experience we are able to research, execute, and work with local entities to satisfy any local and state requirements. 



Why Does It Cost so Much for a Lemonade Stand?
A natural question about Jack's Stands is why the stands cost so much. After all, lemonade stands are the first business that kids have, at the end of their driveways or streets.  
But Jack's Stands are on a completely different level. What family has the time, resources, or commitment to put their child's stand in an actual marketplace with real customers, or to properly satisfy the requirements of local health departments, sale tax licenses, insurance, etc.?  Or to have the ability to take credit cards, track sales through an app, and go through a profit-and-loss statement to learn about revenue, expenses, and profits or loss!


What You Get! (and meet the kids!)

Pay It Forward Perks
Two levels of Pay It Forward Perks.  The first level provides a child with a free lemonade at one of the many Jack's Stands this summer.  This perk helps kids with their initial shyness at Jack's Stands by offering a free lemonade to every other customer (until the this perk is exhausted), customers who may not be able to afford a lemonade or would walk by.    
In addition, each drink given away under Pay It Forward Perks will count as a ""sale"" made to the child operating the stand, and count to his or her revenue at the end of the day.  It's like you were buying the the lemonade yourself!  Lastly, you will have your name mentioned on our Pay It Forward Wall of Fame page at JacksStands.com, with a sincere thank you from Jack and the kids operating Jack's Stands that day!  
The second level--Pay It Forward Perks Plus--provides the same benefits as above, except this level will Pay It Forward to a family of four, while supporting Jack's Stands expansion plans!

Max'is Creations

When
I was 8 years old, I had the idea to put a basketball hoop on a mug that I was
making in art class at school.  My mugs are not just for kids. Moms like my mugs because they help kids not fool around at the table. And adults who like sports like them too.  My product reviews have been really great!  My mugs are good for people who can’t go outside and play basketball. Like kids in the hospital.  And people needing occupational therapy.  I like sports and hot chocolate and that’s why I did it.  Thanks for letting me tell you about my mugs.
Max has sold over 44,000 mugs! He has 5 different mugs (pictured above); Mug With A Hoop, Mug With A Glove, Mug With A Goal, Mug With A Goalpost, and Mug With A Net!

  Stellen wir uns unser Badehaus einfach mal gemeinsam vor:Zuber aus Holz, gefüllt mit warmem, dampfenden Wasser. Der Duft naturbelassener Öle und Essenzen. Sanfter Kerzenschimmer - ein Ort, an dem man die Seele baumeln lassen kann. Stimmungsvolle Dekoration in einem edlen Ambiente, mit charmanter Gesellschaft machen das Badevergnügen perfekt.

Was du uns gibst & was du bekommst

Wie jeder Traum kostet auch der unsere Geld und mit eurer Hilfe können wir ihn wahr werden lassen.

Es macht uns einfach glücklich, euch rundum zu verwöhnen. 


Die Folgen

Nach den vielen Jahren, die wir als Zuberteam gearbeitet haben, wird es Zeit, unsere eigenen Ideen und Visionen umzusetzen. Wir drei bringen es auf stattliche 30 Jahre Erfahrung mit historischen Badehäusern. All dieses Wissen wollen wir nicht nur in einem funktionierenden Badehaus umsetzen, sondern wir wollen das beste mobile Badehaus Europas bauen. Natürlich wird unser Badehaus schön sein, ein stimmiges Ambiente haben und euch in eine andere Welt entführen, aber das reicht uns nicht. Wir wollen eine optimale, technische Ausrüstung.

Mit eurer Hilfe wollen wir genau diesen Unterschied finanzieren. 



Risiken & Herausforderungen


Die größte Herausforderung ist für uns die Terminakquise. Natürlich haben wir uns schon Gedanken gemacht, mit welchen Veranstaltern wir zusammenarbeiten wollen, aber wir können - logischerweise - erst konkret Termine vereinbaren, wenn das Badehaus finanziert, gebaut und getestet ist. Der Zeitplan ist also jetzt schon relativ knapp bemessen. Und natürlich brauchen wir eine gewisse Anzahl an Terminen, um dann unsere erste Saison zu überstehen. Wir haben diese Herausforderung deutlich vor Augen und wissen, dass wir sie meistern können und werden. Es ist ganz klar, je erfolgreicher diese Kampagne ist, umso entspannter können wir in unsere erste Saison mit dem eigenen Badehaus starten, zusammen werden wir es schaffen, Lavabrum Luxurium Wirklichkeit werden zu lassen. Wenn unser Badehaus erst gebaut ist, schaffen wir alles andere auch.

<p><b>GlobalSay</b> will be connecting multiple local debates on important topics. It will report the conclusions of the debates
to decision-makers. It will be a
not-for-profit online tool for widely distributed democratic debates.</p>
<p><b>You</b> are an engaged person. We should discuss
matters that concern us all you think. When you discuss with your friends, family, colleagues you may have had the thought how small
the discussion group is – compared to how important the issue is. You
feel that our world should act as one big democratic deliberation
space.</p>
<p><b>We</b> agree: Big decisions about our lives are taken each day at national,
trans-national and global level. But where are the spaces where the
citizens themselves can discuss these matters? And which systems can gather the responses of the citizens and direct them to decision-makers? We want to make that system.</p>
<p><b>GlobalSay</b> will be a world-covering platform that will
help people like you set up their own local events for debate, highly
coordinated across the globe; it provides balanced high-quality information
about the debated topics; it guides the discussion groups through a debate
program; collects and compares the conclusions of the participating citizens.
And finally – serves the conclusions to relevant policy-makers.</p>
<b>It
is even more for you</b>
since GlobalSay will not only be useful for global debates. Your
national sports association may want to listen to its members in a national
large scale dialogue? Or the scouts may want to have a national discussion, in
which all scout units have their town hall meeting – and they want to gather the
responses and discuss them when all the scout leaders have their yearly
assembly?  <b><b>GlobalSay can
be used for that <b>and much, much more</b>.</b></b><b><br/></b><p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>We will make a platform that makes it possible
to set up a multi-site top-quality fair democratic coordinated debate in a few
months, based upon multiple small local debates arranged by local engaged
people like you</b>.</p>

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>Experts, NGO's, industry, parties - all of them try to influence politics, and they all claim to speak for the public good. But when is it that the public is actually heard? Opinion polls provide reflex answers that people even cannot recall after they answered. What we need is spaces/opportunities for people to be informed, deliberate and provide their reflected and considered answers. Many decision-makers know that and they call for proper public participation.</p>
<p>GlobalSay will be built in order to allow for exactly that: An opportunity for all to take part in dialogues and debates, which are well-informed so that they provide well-considered answers.<br/></p>
<p>In order to
make a GlobalSay Action have <b>policy
impact</b> there needs to be trust  and there needs to be a good contact to the policy-making level. </p>
<p>First of
all GlobalSay wants to be a balanced and unbiased initiative. The intention is
to truly bring the voices of citizens to the ears of decision-makers – not to
favor certain positions. The impact will be built upon this credibility. Secondly,
we have a very large network of potential partners who have very good contact
to and are trusted by decision-makers and these contacts will be used and
expanded. Thirdly, the Partners will be trained and engaged in establishing new
contacts to policy-makers locally, nationally and internationally so that GlobalSay
gets the contacts it needs to get the message through. We certainly expect that GlobalSay will attract much attention among
policy-makers and media - if not for other reasons then because of the reach and size of it.</p>
<p>The Coordinator DBT has
coordinated global citizen <a href=""www.wwviews.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">World Wide Views</a> debates involving from 25 to 76 nations in
collaboration with UN, EU and national governments. And now we want to bring
the target higher and we want new on-line services and democratic crowds to help
that happen. That is where the idea of GlobalSay<b>
</b>comes from and where the impacs will grow from.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> The main risk we will face is connected to getting this widely known so that we get many people on board as Members. We will, of course, use social media etc. but we basically trust that rumours will spread fast and people will join. GlobalSay is an opportunity to be part of things that matter. Many people want that, we believe.</p>
<p>But what if this does not happen or happens too slowly? Then we have a Plan B: We are making many other forms of activities and our many colleages around the globe as well. We and they will then begin to use the GlobalSay system for those projects and we will thereby slowly develop a large Community.</p>
<p>Another risk is that we will face problems with making the platform work properly. We do not really find that to be a large risk since we are quite experienced in such work, and since we are very well connected with top-class software developers. But a risk always good to be aware of...</p>
<p>The largest risk is that fundraising goes slow/small, so that it will take too much efforts to get GlobalSay finished for implementation. But that is a risk you can really help us avoid.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We are building a method in which the Community is incredibly important.</p>
<ul> <li>You can really help it all along by spreading the word about this - ask people to check out this Indoegogo page! <br/>

<li>Ask them to consider joining the Community at some point in the future.</li> <li>Ask them to use their contacts, social media, networks to spread the word.<br/>

“Sometimes home is full of new possibilities, you just have to look or change how you look.” Jacques Lecoq


Who am I?

My name is Mo’min Swaitat and I am a young Palestinian performer and performing arts teacher. My work aims to address some of the hardships of life under occupation by encouraging creative and artistic expression amongst young people and engaging young artist to provide for them platform for advanced practitioners in the arts interested in further to the unknown to look at it from different ways. 
Having recently graduated from the London International School for Performing Arts (LISPA) where I trained in the Lecoq method, I am currently teaching at Al-Kasaba Academy in Ramallah. I am now planning to introduce Lecoq to Palestine for the first time.
I aim to open a cutting-edge performing arts and cultural space within Al-Kasaba Theatre, which will function for workshops, rehearsals, public performances and as a cafe/workspace for young creatives and the local community in Ramallah. 
The space won't just be used for performers, but will be open to anyone who wants to hold new kinds of cultural events or is looking for a creative hub where they can meet likeminded people and brainstorm new ideas. This is something we artists desperately need in Palestine. 

Why Lecoq?
Why Lecoq?Jacques Lecoq was a leading French mime and performing arts instructor who believed that teaching techniques of body movement, clowning, mime, puppetry and mask work could facilitate physical and emotional release.
By emphasising mask training and other forms of expression over the spoken word, Jacques Lecoq wished to create a less elitist type of theatre which would give a voice to the marginalised and disempowered of the world. This is something that I found very inspiring throughout my training at LISPA, where I discovered how physical theatre could be used as a powerful tool for communicating social and political issues affecting the Palestinian community.
The main aim of teaching Lecoq is to provide a safe and supportive environment in which young people can express their thoughts, feelings and emotions about life under occupation, whilst also liberating them from their day-to-day realities by exploring new ways of thinking and being in Palestine.

Why is this important? 
Having lived and worked in Jenin refugee camp for much of my life, I have observed firsthand the devastating consequences of military occupation on different Palestinian communities in the West Bank. In addition to unemployment and restrictions on their travel, routine exposure to violence and imprisonment has resulted in soaring levels of post-traumatic stress and widespread feelings of frustration and hopelessness.
As a young Palestinian actor and director, I have seen how therapeutic and empowering theatre can be for both performers and audiences in Palestine. I believe strongly that theatre has great potential to educate both performers and audiences about the many artistic non-violent forms that the Palestinian struggle can take. But I am concerned about moving away from many of the stereotypical representations of Palestinians in theatre. I believe that Lecoq training will provide students with the necessary freedom and distance to explore the issues affecting them today whilst not relying on conventional modes of storytelling which can limit imagination and creative expression.
Sadly, there are currently no programmes offered in the West Bank which focus on physical theatre.

I hope that introducing the Lecoq Method to Al-Kasaba will equip emerging Palestinian artists with the skills required to perform professionally and compete on an international stage, providing hope and inspiration, as well as new opportunities, for performers living under occupation.

What will the space include? 
The new space will feature brand-new equipment and props : lighting, sound equipment, projectors, a full set of Lecoq masks amongst others.
When not being used for workshops weekly performances and rehearsals, the space will also be open as a cafe with wi-fi for young creatives and others to come and work, brainstorm ideas and unwind.

It has never been more important to support the arts in Palestine, which is a desperately under-funded sector. This project will be the first of its kind in the West Bank. Now I need your help to ensure that together we can make it a reality. ..

It's not just a Drink it's an Experience

Our premium Hemp Infused Gluten Free Vodka is distilled 3 times, and filtered. We source the finest ingredients. The result is a medium bodied Vodka that produces a slightly nutty flavor on the front, and an Ultra Smooth Vanilla Finish. Served best chilled or over ice.



                                                                         Front Bottle Label
Olde Imperial Mystic Hemp Infused Vodka contains no THC. THC is the psychoactive ingredient found in Marijuana. 
Our product will stand out from its competition as our beautifully package Vodka will have a smokey appearance . This smokey appearance is the result of the maceration process. Some have said it looks as though someone has blown smoke into the bottle.  


                                                                        Back Label
Gluten Free for those 3 million people in the USA  who suffer from Celiac disease a autoimmune disorder that can occur in genetically predisposed people where the ingestion of gluten leads to damage in the small intestine. And for the 18 Million more who are Gluten Sensitive.



Hemp seeds contain omega-6 and omega - 3 fatty acids, proteins, vitamins A, E and D, and many B vitamins. They are also rich in sodium,calcium and dietary fiber and iron. Our process of macerating hemp seeds in grain alcohol, extracts oils from the seeds. This process does capture a percentage of the omega's , minerals, and vitamins.  Please note, Olde Imperial MYSTIC Hemp Infused Vodka, is not a heath drink nor should it be consider as part of a healthy diet or life style. As with any alcohol, please drink it in moderation and do not drink and operate a motor vehicle or heavy equipment.

                                            Distribution
A New York based beverage alcohol distributor has been appointed, and is in place to launch the brand. Expected product launch is spring of 2016. Our NY distributor is owned and operated by a 25 year industry veteran who has many past successes in building brands in the Metro New York Market.

The distributor employees a talented sales force who understand that a sale to a retailer is not a true sale, but that a true sale is achieved when a customer makes a purchase of a product they represent. And to achieve a true sale, a product is not just sold to a retailer, the product is placed. Meaning that products must be placed in key positions on a shelf, counter or in a floor display, to provide the fullest exposure possible to customers. 
It is because of this philosophy that we choose Forum Brands to be our NY distributor and to manage our product launch.
                                             Distillery
                              
Our product is produced by master distiller Dustin Skartved, in Riviera Beach Florida. We choose Dustin because he is a true artisan that takes pride in his work and is very easy to work with.  His philosophy towards distillation is to use quality products and processes in every step of the process, beginning with fermentation and ending in a quality finished product. The proof of his dedication is in the bottle!

 Why do we need to run a crowd funding campaign
Now Brands, is seeking to raise additional capital so that we may reach economies of scales in production, that will better enable us to market, advertise and expand distribution past our initial target market of Metro New York.  
Olde Imperial Mystic Vodka, is presently scheduled to launch the product in the 2nd quarter of 2016.

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>InLight's audience grows each year. From 2013 to 2014, attendance grew by over 2500 visitors. Yet with it being just one night, so many miss out! A second night invites many more visitors from the Richmond area, Central Virginia, and beyond to experience InLight!  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Producing a two-night InLight has been a topic of consideration for several years. However, InLight is an expensive project and while 1708 has had fantastic sponsors over many years, the total costs to produce a second night have been too high a barrier.  </p>
<p>This year, the unique opportunity to have InLight on the grounds of VMFA has inspired many of our supporters to increase their sponsorship of InLight and help make this notion a reality. </p>
<p>We are close to our goal and hope that you will help us raise the final necessary funds!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you can't make a financial contribution, there are other ways that you can help!</p> <ul> <li>Ask friends, family, and colleagues to help spread the word and make some noise about our campaign. You can share through Indiegogo!</li> <li>Invite friends, family, and colleagues to InLight! </li>

The Impact InLight's audience grows each year. From 2013 to 2014, attendance grew by over 2500 visitors. Yet with it being just one night, so many miss out! A second night invites many more visitors from the Richmond area, Central Virginia, and beyond to experience InLight!  

    Risks & Challenges Producing a two-night InLight has been a topic of consideration for several years. However, InLight is an expensive project and while 1708 has had fantastic sponsors over many years, the total costs to produce a second night have been too high a barrier.  
This year, the unique opportunity to have InLight on the grounds of VMFA has inspired many of our supporters to increase their sponsorship of InLight and help make this notion a reality. 
We are close to our goal and hope that you will help us raise the final necessary funds!

    Other Ways You Can Help If you can't make a financial contribution, there are other ways that you can help!  Ask friends, family, and colleagues to help spread the word and make some noise about our campaign. You can share through Indiegogo! Invite friends, family, and colleagues to InLight!

<p><b>We are Michela and Georg, a
couple living in Italy. We are desperately trying to find funds to save our 2.5 acres, 85-year-old
Single-Vineyard. We have received an injunction from the Regione Piemonte that threatens us to uproot the vineyard within April 1st 2016, otherwise the vineyard will be uprooted by a team of workers at our expenses (plus 3.100 € of fine) and therefore lost forever.</b></p>
<p><b>There's not much time left before the deadline, but we are working as much as we can 7 days a week to prevent our vineyard to be cut down! We are halfway with cleaning and cutting the wild shoots and pruning. But the big problem is that we urgently need 500 stakes, new wires and money to go on with our task! If we don't get funding in the next 3 weeks, all the work we are doing right now is just good for unprooting, not for saving.<br/></b></p>
<p><b>But here is the story from the beginning:<br/></b></p>
<p>Michela works from home as an editor for a publishing company, Georg teaches
German part time as a Lecturer at Torino University and does some writing for
children and translations. <br/></p>
<p>4 years ago we bought half of an old farmhouse in <a href=""https://www.google.it/maps/place/14024+Moncucco+Torinese+AT/@45.0672669,7.9143242,14z/data=%214m2%213m1%211s0x4787defa731f5a59:0xae2454958727c468"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Moncucco Torinese</a>, nestled in
the hills of Monferrato 30 km south-east of Torino. These rolling hills form a wonderful landscape and are full of wine and history. So far we have managed to
renovate only a part of our farmhouse but we had to stop any further work simply
because the money is tight. <br/></p>
<h4>
<b>Together with the farmhouse
came 2.5 acres of an old vineyard that produces </b><a href=""http://www.agraria.org/vini/freisa-di-chieri-doc.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Freisa</b></a>-<b>wine. </b>

<h3>
<b>A living example of bio-diversity</b><br/>
</h3>
<p><b>The vineyard was planted at the very end of the 1920's and therefore is amongst
the oldest implants of vineyards in the whole region. Some of the 
single roots contain genoma that today are either extremely rare to find or have not been mapped before. Therefore, this
 vineyard is a symbol of bio-diversity, but it risks to be uprooted by 
law.</b>. </p>
<p>The vineyard came as part of the property but we didn't know anything about vineyards and
wine-making. For some 20 years a farmer had
leased the vineyard for a low annual fee from the old house-owner, doing all
the work and selling the grapes to the ""Cantina Sociale""
(wine-cooperative) of Castelnuovo Don Bosco. He agreed on keeping things the way they were with the previous
owners and we signed the contract. So we figured we'd have plenty
of time to deal with the vineyard <i>after </i>the renovation of the house. But after we moved in, it was clear that the farmer was letting the
vineyard gradually slip out of control. He simply was getting too old to keep a vineyard in shape. You have to prune and tie each plant with great care, replace rotten stakes with new ones and keep the wires
in shape. Once the stakes
start to tilt, a tractor can't get in between the rows and at once the whole
vineyard gets out of control very fast. <br/></p>
<p><b>The picture below was taken when we started the work on the house. Even if you don't know much about vineyards, you can clearly see how badly all stakes were tilted and that weeds were growing between the roots.</b><br/></p>

<br/><p>The old farmer told
us he hadn't felt well lately and needed to retire. What a blow. We had to take
a decision, and fast. No farmer nearby was willing to step in, considering the state the vineyard was in. We
called friends, searched for experts on vineyard-farming, met a
number of people and asked for their opinion. After long discussions we decided
to take on the work ourselves. We knew it would be a hard
task. We had no idea how hard it would have been...</p>

vineyard looked 3 years ago!</b></p>

<h4>A stroke of luck</h4>
<h4>
</h4>
<p></p>
<p>Amongst many others, we talked to Mario Casalegno, (a professional
wine-maker with a degree in viticulture and ""agrotecnico""). He came to look at our vineyard and was thrilled by the age of the
vines, the wonderful exposure and soil, that would guarantee excellent wine. He
said he would help us as much as possible (for free in the first season)
with the tasks of the vineyard, come by with his tractor for the necessary
treatments against major grape diseases, for the milling and to help us keep
the expenses to a minimum. Most of all, Mario said he would do the wine-making
in his professional cellar... not for money, but in return for a little bit of
our wine. Because he is a professional wine-maker and undergoes quality
control, the location of our vineyard and his wine-making will mean that <b>our
wine will have the official Italian and international registered designation
of origin <i>(D.O.C). But most of all, it's top quality-wine.<br/></i></b></p>
<p>So that was a new start with high hopes...</p>
<p></p>

<p><b>Michela is very good at pruning!</b></p>
<p></p>
<h4><b>What we have done so far</b></h4>
<p>We are now into our third year. The good news is that we managed to clean
and maintain more than a fourth of the whole vineyard. Mario came over
many times and explained every step. It was no piece of cake, but hard
work. For this recovery, we have each put every year more than 500 hours' work
in. And the results are:</p>
<ol>
<li>this first part of the vineyard has been thoroughly
     pruned throughout the last 3 years, thus verticalizing again the
     vine-plants, giving them new strength and stamina;</li>
<li>the worst 250 tilted stakes have been
     replaced, all by hand, mostly replanting the old wooden stakes in new
     holes about a meter deep. We bought approximately 120 second-hand stakes to replace the worst;</li>
<li>all missing/old wires were replaced by new ones
     (there are 4 wires running between the stakes);</li>
<li>we cut and uprooted hundreds of small trees that
     had started to grow between the rows.</li>
<li>we took care of most of the weeds growing underneath
     and between the rows by hand and with a trimmer (which is a very <a href=""https://www.doubleavineyards.com/news.aspx?showarticle=51"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">important </a>and
     time-consuming task!);</li>
<li>we did all of the disease-management treatments
     with a <a href=""https://www.doubleavineyards.com/news.aspx?showarticle=49"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">backpack sprayer</a> since no tractor can pass through the
rows of the     ""bad part"" of our vineyard.</li>
</ol>
<h4><b>During harvest 2013 we managed

<p><b>We replanted the stakes (except the row on the right, 
at that time we were working on it) in the ""good part"" of the 
vineyard (the weed was cut </b><b> with a 
trimmer </b><b>shortly after we took the pic).</b></p>
<h4></h4>
</div>
<p>There is nothing in nature that gets out of control so fast as a vineyard,
and if you don't prune in winter you have no grapes in autumn. The weeds grow
fast, the plants grow wild and start crawling in every direction
(without production of grapes), the stakes tilt and everything turns into a
jungle within a year. <br/></p><p><br/></p><h4>More problems<br/>
</h4>2014 was an extremely bad year for wine-makers. In spring it started to rain and temperature dropped. And this didn't stop for months. The
plants caught grape diseases such as powdery and downy mildew, black rot,
phomopsis. (See <a href=""https://www.doubleavineyards.com/news.aspx?showarticle=50"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here </a>for further info). Unluckily
the rotten weather didn't stop and it rained every single day until harvest
time, which was the worst case scenario, simply because you can't treat when it
rains. Speaking about bad luck: it was the worst year in vine-making in the
last 100 years in Piedmont - and had little to do with our inexperience. Even
our 60 tomato-plants died of fungi. Because of the <a href=""https://www.doubleavineyards.com/news.aspx?showarticle=37"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">rotten weather</a>, the
ministry of agriculture gave authorization for spraying hard-core fungicides.
We discussed the matter and preferred to lose our entire harvest rather than use
chemicals that alter the plants' DNA and end up inside the wine you drink.
Sometimes Nature decides against us, and we had to accept it, even if for us <b>it
meant losing sales of more than 900 gallons of wine. That sum would have gone into putting the vineyard</b> <b>into good shape</b>. Mario too had big troubles with his own
vineyard, his tractor broke down and he could not help us for over three months.<br/><br/>
<h4><b>Losing the complete 2014
harvest</b></h4>
<p>Without fungicides, we watched thousands of bunches of our vineyard rot
before our eyes. We didn't even need to harvest, because there was not a single
grape left on the branches. What we didn't know was that one of the various
diseases that affected our grapes had also <a href=""http://www.doubleavineyards.com/images/AnthracnoseofGrape2012.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">crippled the shoots</a> that in
spring 2015 would have grown to become future stems, then branches and in the
end produce bunches. So we should have used the hardcore treatment after all,
even had we decided not to make wine out of our grapes because we had used
chemical fungicides.</p>
<h4><b>The consequences of a bad
year: bad can get worse</b></h4>
<p>The bad year cost us any income from our wine we had hoped for. Also, the two of us had simply not enough time to take care of such a great amount of work. We did what we could and gave it all the time we had.</p><p>If we don't get very lucky, the bad part of the vineyard will be uprooted within this year. Uprooting means
that the wires have to be torn away, each and every stake will be torn out and
every plant will be cut at least 1 meter below the ground (otherwise they shoot again). All this has high costs and we can't do it on our own. For uprooting you need 5 - 6
men and a tractor for more than a week. And the expenses - some 4.000/5.000 € - would nearly be enough to put our vineyard back to shape.

</p><p>This would be a terrible blow and not an acceptable solution; this is not the way we want to deal
with our vineyard. We know that with Mario's help the vineyard will produce 900 gallons of wonderful wine in two years'
time... if only we had the chance to save it. We feel it's important
to bring it back on its feet and into production. It's not for the sake of money, but because it is 85-years old and in a perfect histoical position. Yes, it will always produce
less wine than modern vineyards, but such a wonderful wine is worth every
effort. And that's why we are here asking for your help. <br/></p><h4><b>With a
bit more money than the uprooting would cost, we can manage to save a whole
vineyard, and thus keep it in shape for years to come!</b></h4>
<p><b>What we will try to do (and
the relative costs):</b></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Get rid of the weeds and wild tree-shoots:
     2.000 €;</b></li>
<li><b>New stakes ( for a reasonably low price): 2.000
     €;</b></li>
<li><b>New wires: 500 €;</b></li>
<li><b>Plant the stakes and fix the wires: 1.500 €;</b></li>
<li><b>Pay a farmer with a tractor to do the necessary 6
     - 8 treatments in 2016 plus mill between the rows: 1.000 €</b></li>
</ol>
<p><b>Total: 7.000 €</b></p>
<p>We do not want to get rich. We need at least 7.000 € to get the remaining
old part of the vineyard in working shape and producing again by 2017. And we can't even think of
planting the new stakes by hand, because <b>we're talking about 500 stakes at
least</b> (on a long working day I manage to plant about 10 - 12 new stakes
by hand, and fix/change the wires). All this has to be done <b>before the plants start to shoot</b>,
which is about the beginning/middle of April. Also, the stakes have to be paid for. The total amount of work is so high that
we need at least 1.500 € for two or three specialized farmhands with a tractor who first get rid of the old stakes and then plant the new ones by ramming them a meter deep into the ground with the tractor-bucket. Only
afterwards we can put in new wires, prune the plants and tie them to the wires.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452493220/yvqr0vaymhrcwdfpbaoy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b>Cow dung is good for our organic vegetable-garden. In Italy, actors 
wish good luck to each other by saying ""dung"" before going on stage. So 
maybe this helps our vineyard, too?<br/><br/></b><h4><b>What happens if we don't reach
the necessary funding?</b></h4>
<p>Should we end up with less than we need to cover all the expenses for the
whole vineyard, we will employ the funds for saving the ""bad part""
of the vineyard. The lesser money we will receive, the lesser of the vineyard can be salvaged
(For example with 4.000 € we can modernize only about half of the ""bad
part""). In this case, part of the expenses of point 1. would necessarily
go into the uprooting of the vineyard we were not able to modernize... <b>it's
impossible to leave it as it is for one more year.</b> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452606838/wxzhdzmz8yaosl0dcc9t.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b>Here you can see a pic from December '16. Beautiful morning to 
work in the vineyard! What a difference between the ""good"" and the ""bad""
 part behind it (looks more like a jungle)! The lower row needs new stakes, that's
 where I will be going soon.<br/><br/></b><p>Depending on how much funds we will receive, we could eventually decide to
pay for point 1. and the pruning of all plants of the vineyard (without pruning
there will be no future production of grapes) and make at least sure that a
tractor can be used between the rows for the treatments. This would leave the
problems of putting in new stakes and wires, but the plants pruned, the weeds cut and the
milling done by tractor would give us another year's time to somehow buy new
stakes, eventually funded in part by the sales of our wine in two years' time. It's going to be tough, but we care for environment and Nature and work our land as much and as good as
we can. We planted and keep an organic vegetable-garden that gives us fresh organic
vegetables all year round. We also planted fruit-trees and had solar panels
installed on our house roof. We are extremely conscious about not increasing
the industrial agriculture that makes people believe you can bend Nature at
your will, that you can eat whatever you want in every week of the year. We
believe in sustainability and try to protect our environment, using the
absolute minimum of chemical treatments for our vineyard and the wine, while
industrial agriculture with consumer-centered laws alters the equilibrium we should
strive to maintain.<br/></p>
<h4><b>Are there other ways to help
us without donating money?</b></h4>

It's possible. <br/>
One way for you to help us would be coming over to our place in Moncucco
Torinese for some days or a week, possibly in two or three, and give us a hand
with the work in the vineyard.<br/>
What you can do depends on whether you are experienced with pruning or not. If so,
Michela would show you how to do it here, because every region requires a different
pruning. If not, there are hundreds of stakes to be uprooted and new ones to be
planted, old wires to put up, weeds to cut... There are so many things to do...<br/>
In this case Mario (who has in his farmhouse a small ""<a href=""https://www.tripadvisor.it/Restaurant_Review-g1310436-d3529046-Reviews-Cascina_Di_Maggio-Moncucco_Torinese_Province_of_Asti_Piedmont.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>agriturismo</span></a>"" would give you free boarding and we would, happily, make sure that you don't starve nor be thirsty!<br/>
Have a look at our perks, if you have a little time left.<br/>
<br/><h4>
What happens if the funding exceeds our goal?</h4><br/>
Of course we are very concerned about the
vineyard every day. There would be other things we urgently need in order to get
it really going strong in the next years.<br/>
- a small second-hand tractor;<br/>
- design and produce state-of-the-art labels for our bottles;<br/>
- high-quality empty bottles and quality corks;<br/>- we will go totally organic (more time-consuming and thus expensive).<br/>
<br/>
So, rest assured: nothing will be wasted<p><br/></p><h4><b>At this point we need to talk about Freisa and sketch a short history of wine-planting in our area </b></h4>
<p>Freisa is a very old native red wine, amongst the oldest native wines of
this area, mentioned already in the 16<sup>th</sup> century. 
</p><p><b>""<i>Freisa can be a wonderful wine with structure, and those typical, 
intense notes of blackberry, raspberry and freshness. Barrel aging can 
contribute to such balance.</i>""</b></p><b>
</b><p><b><i>Paul Balke</i></b>
</p><p>DNA researchers
discovered that Freisa is the genetic ""grandfather"" of Nebbiolo, and
therefore of Barolo. Nevertheless, in the past 40 years the area 
dedicated to
Freisa has shrunk drastically. In the 70s, phylloxera hit so hard that 
most of vineyards in Piedmont had to be replanted (luckily ours
survived). Most farmers at this point decided to change wine variety, 
because
Freisa, at this point, was the Cinderella of vine-plants; it neither had
 the high
production-rate per acre nor the appeal that Nebbiolo or Barolo were 
starting
to build. Big and medium wine-makers switched to other native grapes 
that
produce 40% more wine per acre with better selling varieties for the
fast-growing international customers. </p>
<p><b>As a result, Freisa has become
increasingly rare. <span>Estimations say there are only some 2000 hectares of Freisa left in Piemonte. </span></b></p>
<p>It's a questionable victory of modern marketing and mechanization over
thousands of small-end medium wine-producers, which means that this excellent,
astonishing, full and rich native wine (alc. 12,5% maintaining its wonderful
organoleptic qualities well over 10 years in a bottle) is slowly going down
memory lane.</p>

<b>Siamo Michela e Georg e stiamo cercando di trovare
fondi per salvare il nostro vigneto di 85 anni e un ettaro di estensione. In
caso contrario, verrà sradicato per legge e andrà perso per sempre.</b></p>
<p>Michela lavora come un redattrice
editoriale, Georg insegna tedesco presso l’Università di Torino e si occupa di
scrittura per l’infanzia e traduzioni. Quattro anni fa abbiamo comprato metà di
una vecchia casa a Moncucco Torinese, 30 km a est di Torino, nelle colline del
Monferrato.</p>
<p>Nella proprietà era incluso un
ettaro abbondante di un vecchio vigneto che produce Freisa, piantato alla fine degli
anni ‘20 del secolo scorso e quindi tra i più antichi impianti del la regione.
(<span><a href=""http://paulbalke.com/freisa-piemontes-forgotten-wine/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Qui</a> potete trovare
un interessante articolo sul Freisa e la prima foto è stata scattata a circa 1
km da noi, in direzione del castello di Moncucco Torinese in cima alla
collina!).</span></p>
<p>Inizialmente non sapevamo nulla di
vigneti e di vinificazione, ma non sembrava essere un problema: per circa 20
anni un contadino aveva affittato la vigna dai proprietari precedenti, vendendo
l’uva alla cantina sociale di Castelnuovo Don Bosco. Quando ci siamo incontrati
si è deciso di continuare con l’affitto e abbiamo pensato che avremmo avuto un
sacco di tempo per affrontare la vigna dopo la ristrutturazione della casa.</p>
<p>Presto, però, ci siamo accorti che l’agricoltore
non stava facendo un buon lavoro, probabilmente per l’età avanzata: le piante
non erano potate a dovere, i pali erano instabili e marci, i fili rischiavano
di rompersi e alla base di ogni filare cresceva l’edera, folta e indisturbata.</p>
<p>L’agricoltore intanto aveva capito
di non riuscire a portare avanti il lavoro per problemi di salute e il
contratto è decaduto. Dopo lunghe discussioni abbiamo deciso di fare il passo e
tentare di fare il lavoro da soli. Sapevamo che sarebbe stato un compito
difficile, ma non avevamo idea di quanto ...</p>
<p><b>Un colpo di fortuna</b></p>
<p>Tra le persone con cui abbiamo
parlato per avere consigli e dritte sulla vigna, c’è stato Mario Casalegno, agrotecnico con l'hobby di enologia, produttore di vino e proprietario dell’agriturismo Cascina di
maggio, a pochi chilometri da casa nostra. La nostra vigna lo entusiasmava:
grazie a lui abbiamo capito quanto fosse rara e preziosa una simile
combinazione di esposizione, terreno ed età delle piante. Una vigna tanto
vecchia non produce in abbondanza, ma in termini di biodiversità è una risorsa
da tenere in vita.</p>
<p>Mario ha deciso di aiutarci
mettendoci a disposizione il trattore per i trattamenti, le sue competenze per
insegnarci i lavori necessari e la sua cantina per la vinificazione, il tutto
in cambio solo di una parte del vino che avremmo prodotto. Inoltre, prendendo
in carico la vigna, il vino avrebbe avuto la denominazione di origine
controllata, impossibile per noi che non eravamo e non siamo professionisti.</p>
<p>Insomma, ottime premesse e grandi
speranze, ma nonostante tutto il duro lavoro non siamo riusciti a ripristinare
l’intera estensione della vigna: in parte perché ciascuno di noi ha già il
proprio lavoro, in parte perché avremmo avuto bisogno di un investimento
iniziale che superava le nostre possibilità.</p>
<p>Dopo tre anni, la buona notizia è
che siamo riusciti a pulire e ripristinare un terzo della vigna.</p>
<p><b>Ecco i risultati</b>:</p>
<p><b>1.</b> questa prima parte del
vigneto è stata potata per restituire alle piante forza e vigore;</p>
<p><b>2.</b> i peggiori 250/300 pali sono
stati sostituiti (a mano!);</p>
<p><b>3.</b> i vecchi fili sono stati
sostituiti;</p>
<p><b>4.</b> abbiamo tagliato e sradicato
l’edera e tanti arbusti che crescevano tra i filari e abbiamo tenuto sotto
controllo le erbacce;</p>
<p><b>5.</b> abbiamo fatto tutti i
trattamenti necessari contro le malattie, in parte con un piccolo trattore e in
parte a mano con un vaporizzatore a spalla (immaginatevi uno zaino che porta 18
litri) là dove il trattore non poteva arrivare.</p>
<p>Dopo la vendemmia 2013 siamo
riusciti a produrre 800 litri di vino: niente male.</p>
<p><b>Perché allora abbiamo ancora bisogno d’aiuto?</b></p>
<p>La sfortuna qualche volta è dietro l’angolo.
Durante i mesi invernali, con l’aiuto di Mario abbiamo potato tutta la vigna e
abbiamo continuato a sostituire i pali peggiori.</p>
<p>La primavera e l’estate del 2014
sono state devastanti per la viticoltura della zona: troppa pioggia e
temperature troppo basse hanno portato con sé malattie come la peronospora,
funghi e muffa. Insomma, l’<i>annus
horribilis</i> dell’ultimo secolo. Per questo il Ministero della Salute ha dato

non avevamo nessuna intenzione di bere un vino che non ci avrebbe fatto bene.
Una buona scelta per la salute, ma poco lungimirante per le sue conseguenze: nel

<p>Perché allora spendere dei soldi che
non abbiamo per rinunciare per sempre a un piccolo patrimonio di tradizione?</p>

<p><b>2. </b>acquisto di nuovi pali (ammesso
che li troviamo a un prezzo ragionevolmente basso): <b>2.000 €</b>;</p>

<p>Con questa

<p>Il Freisa è uno dei più antichi
vitigni autoctoni della nostra zona ed è documentato già nel XVI secolo. Le
ricerche sul DNA hanno dimostrato che, geneticamente parlando, il Freisa è il
""nonno"" del Nebbiolo, e quindi del Barolo. Tuttavia, negli ultimi 40
anni l’area dedicata al Freisa si è ridotta drasticamente. Negli anni ‘70, infatti,
la fillossera ha colpito l’astigiano così gravemente che la maggior parte dei
vigneti in Piemonte fu ripiantata (per fortuna la nostra è sopravvissuta). Molti
agricoltori decisero di cambiare varietà di vino, perché il Freisa non ha un
grande tasso di produzione per ettaro, né la fama del Nebbiolo o del Barolo. Grandi
e medi viticoltori passarono ad altri vitigni autoctoni che producono fino al
40 % in più di vino per ettaro e il Freisa iniziò a essere usato dalle
grandi aziende come vino da taglio. Molti piccoli produttori, invece,
rinunciarono, vendendo le proprie quote di produzione a grandi aziende. Una
quota corrisponde alla possibilità di piantare a vigna una certa superficie di
terreno, indipendentemente dalla varietà di vite e dalla localizzazione del
terreno. Per esempio: se io compro una quota da un produttore che fa dolcetto
d.o.c. ad Alba, posso piantare uve anche scadenti nel mezzo della nebbiosa
pianura Padana e farne vino da tavola disgustoso.</p>
<p>In un
simile contesto economico e legislativo sentiamo sempre di più l’esigenza di
resistere, nel nostro piccolo, all’“industrializzazione” del cibo: non vogliamo bere vini pieni di
solfiti, non vogliamo mangiare pomodori a dicembre né carne piena di ormoni di
animali che non hanno mai visto la luce del sole. Qualche volta è una scelta
impegnativa, ma siamo sicuri che in tanti, ormai, la pensiamo in questo modo.</p>

We are Michela and Georg, a
couple living in Italy. We are desperately trying to find funds to save our 2.5 acres, 85-year-old
Single-Vineyard. We have received an injunction from the Regione Piemonte that threatens us to uproot the vineyard within April 1st 2016, otherwise the vineyard will be uprooted by a team of workers at our expenses (plus 3.100 € of fine) and therefore lost forever.
There's not much time left before the deadline, but we are working as much as we can 7 days a week to prevent our vineyard to be cut down! We are halfway with cleaning and cutting the wild shoots and pruning. But the big problem is that we urgently need 500 stakes, new wires and money to go on with our task! If we don't get funding in the next 3 weeks, all the work we are doing right now is just good for unprooting, not for saving.
But here is the story from the beginning:
Michela works from home as an editor for a publishing company, Georg teaches
German part time as a Lecturer at Torino University and does some writing for
children and translations. 
4 years ago we bought half of an old farmhouse in Moncucco Torinese, nestled in
the hills of Monferrato 30 km south-east of Torino. These rolling hills form a wonderful landscape and are full of wine and history. So far we have managed to
renovate only a part of our farmhouse but we had to stop any further work simply
because the money is tight. 

Together with the farmhouse
came 2.5 acres of an old vineyard that produces Freisa-wine. 

Here you find an interesting article in English about Freisa.

A living example of bio-diversity

The vineyard was planted at the very end of the 1920's and therefore is amongst
the oldest implants of vineyards in the whole region. Some of the 
single roots contain genoma that today are either extremely rare to find or have not been mapped before. Therefore, this
 vineyard is a symbol of bio-diversity, but it risks to be uprooted by 
law.. 
The vineyard came as part of the property but we didn't know anything about vineyards and
wine-making. For some 20 years a farmer had
leased the vineyard for a low annual fee from the old house-owner, doing all
the work and selling the grapes to the ""Cantina Sociale""
(wine-cooperative) of Castelnuovo Don Bosco. He agreed on keeping things the way they were with the previous
owners and we signed the contract. So we figured we'd have plenty
of time to deal with the vineyard after the renovation of the house. But after we moved in, it was clear that the farmer was letting the
vineyard gradually slip out of control. He simply was getting too old to keep a vineyard in shape. You have to prune and tie each plant with great care, replace rotten stakes with new ones and keep the wires
in shape. Once the stakes
start to tilt, a tractor can't get in between the rows and at once the whole
vineyard gets out of control very fast. 
The picture below was taken when we started the work on the house. Even if you don't know much about vineyards, you can clearly see how badly all stakes were tilted and that weeds were growing between the roots.


The old farmer told
us he hadn't felt well lately and needed to retire. What a blow. We had to take
a decision, and fast. No farmer nearby was willing to step in, considering the state the vineyard was in. We
called friends, searched for experts on vineyard-farming, met a
number of people and asked for their opinion. After long discussions we decided
to take on the work ourselves. We knew it would be a hard
task. We had no idea how hard it would have been...
This is a detail how parts of the
vineyard looked 3 years ago!





In the pic above you see the terrible shape the stakes and the weeds are in the part of the vineyard we couldn't get under control.
The ""good"" part is getting in shape with a little help from a friend.





Here you see what a battle it is to get things under control once you allow wild trees and bushes to grow!



A stroke of luck



Amongst many others, we talked to Mario Casalegno, (a professional
wine-maker with a degree in viticulture and ""agrotecnico""). He came to look at our vineyard and was thrilled by the age of the
vines, the wonderful exposure and soil, that would guarantee excellent wine. He
said he would help us as much as possible (for free in the first season)
with the tasks of the vineyard, come by with his tractor for the necessary
treatments against major grape diseases, for the milling and to help us keep
the expenses to a minimum. Most of all, Mario said he would do the wine-making
in his professional cellar... not for money, but in return for a little bit of
our wine. Because he is a professional wine-maker and undergoes quality
control, the location of our vineyard and his wine-making will mean that our
wine will have the official Italian and international registered designation
of origin (D.O.C). But most of all, it's top quality-wine.
So that was a new start with high hopes...


Michela is very good at pruning!

What we have done so far
We are now into our third year. The good news is that we managed to clean
and maintain more than a fourth of the whole vineyard. Mario came over
many times and explained every step. It was no piece of cake, but hard
work. For this recovery, we have each put every year more than 500 hours' work
in. And the results are:

this first part of the vineyard has been thoroughly
     pruned throughout the last 3 years, thus verticalizing again the
     vine-plants, giving them new strength and stamina;
the worst 250 tilted stakes have been
     replaced, all by hand, mostly replanting the old wooden stakes in new
     holes about a meter deep. We bought approximately 120 second-hand stakes to replace the worst;
all missing/old wires were replaced by new ones
     (there are 4 wires running between the stakes);
we cut and uprooted hundreds of small trees that
     had started to grow between the rows.
we took care of most of the weeds growing underneath
     and between the rows by hand and with a trimmer (which is a very important and
     time-consuming task!);
we did all of the disease-management treatments
     with a backpack sprayer since no tractor can pass through the
rows of the     ""bad part"" of our vineyard.

During harvest 2013 we managed
to produce 800 liters (210 gallons) of wonderful wine from the ""good part"".


Mario concentrating on his old hydraulic press

this is how the ""good
part"" of the vineyard looked like in September 2015
We replanted the stakes (except the row on the right, 
at that time we were working on it) in the ""good part"" of the 
vineyard (the weed was cut  with a 
trimmer shortly after we took the pic).


There is nothing in nature that gets out of control so fast as a vineyard,
and if you don't prune in winter you have no grapes in autumn. The weeds grow
fast, the plants grow wild and start crawling in every direction
(without production of grapes), the stakes tilt and everything turns into a
jungle within a year. More problems
2014 was an extremely bad year for wine-makers. In spring it started to rain and temperature dropped. And this didn't stop for months. The
plants caught grape diseases such as powdery and downy mildew, black rot,
phomopsis. (See here for further info). Unluckily
the rotten weather didn't stop and it rained every single day until harvest
time, which was the worst case scenario, simply because you can't treat when it
rains. Speaking about bad luck: it was the worst year in vine-making in the
last 100 years in Piedmont - and had little to do with our inexperience. Even
our 60 tomato-plants died of fungi. Because of the rotten weather, the
ministry of agriculture gave authorization for spraying hard-core fungicides.
We discussed the matter and preferred to lose our entire harvest rather than use
chemicals that alter the plants' DNA and end up inside the wine you drink.
Sometimes Nature decides against us, and we had to accept it, even if for us it
meant losing sales of more than 900 gallons of wine. That sum would have gone into putting the vineyard into good shape. Mario too had big troubles with his own
vineyard, his tractor broke down and he could not help us for over three months.
Losing the complete 2014
harvest
Without fungicides, we watched thousands of bunches of our vineyard rot
before our eyes. We didn't even need to harvest, because there was not a single
grape left on the branches. What we didn't know was that one of the various
diseases that affected our grapes had also crippled the shoots that in
spring 2015 would have grown to become future stems, then branches and in the
end produce bunches. So we should have used the hardcore treatment after all,
even had we decided not to make wine out of our grapes because we had used
chemical fungicides.
The consequences of a bad
year: bad can get worse
The bad year cost us any income from our wine we had hoped for. Also, the two of us had simply not enough time to take care of such a great amount of work. We did what we could and gave it all the time we had.If we don't get very lucky, the bad part of the vineyard will be uprooted within this year. Uprooting means
that the wires have to be torn away, each and every stake will be torn out and
every plant will be cut at least 1 meter below the ground (otherwise they shoot again). All this has high costs and we can't do it on our own. For uprooting you need 5 - 6
men and a tractor for more than a week. And the expenses - some 4.000/5.000 € - would nearly be enough to put our vineyard back to shape.

This would be a terrible blow and not an acceptable solution; this is not the way we want to deal
with our vineyard. We know that with Mario's help the vineyard will produce 900 gallons of wonderful wine in two years'
time... if only we had the chance to save it. We feel it's important
to bring it back on its feet and into production. It's not for the sake of money, but because it is 85-years old and in a perfect histoical position. Yes, it will always produce
less wine than modern vineyards, but such a wonderful wine is worth every
effort. And that's why we are here asking for your help. With a
bit more money than the uprooting would cost, we can manage to save a whole
vineyard, and thus keep it in shape for years to come!
What we will try to do (and
the relative costs):

Get rid of the weeds and wild tree-shoots:
     2.000 €;
New stakes ( for a reasonably low price): 2.000
     €;
New wires: 500 €;
Plant the stakes and fix the wires: 1.500 €;
Pay a farmer with a tractor to do the necessary 6
     - 8 treatments in 2016 plus mill between the rows: 1.000 €

Total: 7.000 €
We do not want to get rich. We need at least 7.000 € to get the remaining
old part of the vineyard in working shape and producing again by 2017. And we can't even think of
planting the new stakes by hand, because we're talking about 500 stakes at
least (on a long working day I manage to plant about 10 - 12 new stakes
by hand, and fix/change the wires). All this has to be done before the plants start to shoot,
which is about the beginning/middle of April. Also, the stakes have to be paid for. The total amount of work is so high that
we need at least 1.500 € for two or three specialized farmhands with a tractor who first get rid of the old stakes and then plant the new ones by ramming them a meter deep into the ground with the tractor-bucket. Only
afterwards we can put in new wires, prune the plants and tie them to the wires.Cow dung is good for our organic vegetable-garden. In Italy, actors 
wish good luck to each other by saying ""dung"" before going on stage. So 
maybe this helps our vineyard, too?What happens if we don't reach
the necessary funding?
Should we end up with less than we need to cover all the expenses for the
whole vineyard, we will employ the funds for saving the ""bad part""
of the vineyard. The lesser money we will receive, the lesser of the vineyard can be salvaged
(For example with 4.000 € we can modernize only about half of the ""bad
part""). In this case, part of the expenses of point 1. would necessarily
go into the uprooting of the vineyard we were not able to modernize... it's
impossible to leave it as it is for one more year. 
Here you can see a pic from December '16. Beautiful morning to 
work in the vineyard! What a difference between the ""good"" and the ""bad""
 part behind it (looks more like a jungle)! The lower row needs new stakes, that's
 where I will be going soon.Depending on how much funds we will receive, we could eventually decide to
pay for point 1. and the pruning of all plants of the vineyard (without pruning
there will be no future production of grapes) and make at least sure that a
tractor can be used between the rows for the treatments. This would leave the
problems of putting in new stakes and wires, but the plants pruned, the weeds cut and the
milling done by tractor would give us another year's time to somehow buy new
stakes, eventually funded in part by the sales of our wine in two years' time. It's going to be tough, but we care for environment and Nature and work our land as much and as good as
we can. We planted and keep an organic vegetable-garden that gives us fresh organic
vegetables all year round. We also planted fruit-trees and had solar panels
installed on our house roof. We are extremely conscious about not increasing
the industrial agriculture that makes people believe you can bend Nature at
your will, that you can eat whatever you want in every week of the year. We
believe in sustainability and try to protect our environment, using the
absolute minimum of chemical treatments for our vineyard and the wine, while
industrial agriculture with consumer-centered laws alters the equilibrium we should
strive to maintain.
Are there other ways to help
us without donating money?

It's possible. 
One way for you to help us would be coming over to our place in Moncucco
Torinese for some days or a week, possibly in two or three, and give us a hand
with the work in the vineyard.
What you can do depends on whether you are experienced with pruning or not. If so,
Michela would show you how to do it here, because every region requires a different
pruning. If not, there are hundreds of stakes to be uprooted and new ones to be
planted, old wires to put up, weeds to cut... There are so many things to do...
In this case Mario (who has in his farmhouse a small ""agriturismo"" would give you free boarding and we would, happily, make sure that you don't starve nor be thirsty!
Have a look at our perks, if you have a little time left.

What happens if the funding exceeds our goal?
Of course we are very concerned about the
vineyard every day. There would be other things we urgently need in order to get
it really going strong in the next years.
- a small second-hand tractor;
- design and produce state-of-the-art labels for our bottles;
- high-quality empty bottles and quality corks;- we will go totally organic (more time-consuming and thus expensive).

So, rest assured: nothing will be wastedAt this point we need to talk about Freisa and sketch a short history of wine-planting in our area 
Freisa is a very old native red wine, amongst the oldest native wines of
this area, mentioned already in the 16th century. 
""Freisa can be a wonderful wine with structure, and those typical, 
intense notes of blackberry, raspberry and freshness. Barrel aging can 
contribute to such balance.""
Paul Balke
DNA researchers
discovered that Freisa is the genetic ""grandfather"" of Nebbiolo, and
therefore of Barolo. Nevertheless, in the past 40 years the area 
dedicated to
Freisa has shrunk drastically. In the 70s, phylloxera hit so hard that 
most of vineyards in Piedmont had to be replanted (luckily ours
survived). Most farmers at this point decided to change wine variety, 
because
Freisa, at this point, was the Cinderella of vine-plants; it neither had
 the high
production-rate per acre nor the appeal that Nebbiolo or Barolo were 
starting
to build. Big and medium wine-makers switched to other native grapes 
that
produce 40% more wine per acre with better selling varieties for the
fast-growing international customers. 
As a result, Freisa has become
increasingly rare. Estimations say there are only some 2000 hectares of Freisa left in Piemonte. 
It's a questionable victory of modern marketing and mechanization over
thousands of small-end medium wine-producers, which means that this excellent,
astonishing, full and rich native wine (alc. 12,5% maintaining its wonderful
organoleptic qualities well over 10 years in a bottle) is slowly going down
memory lane.

Siamo Michela e Georg e stiamo cercando di trovare
fondi per salvare il nostro vigneto di 85 anni e un ettaro di estensione. In
caso contrario, verrà sradicato per legge e andrà perso per sempre.
Michela lavora come un redattrice
editoriale, Georg insegna tedesco presso l’Università di Torino e si occupa di
scrittura per l’infanzia e traduzioni. Quattro anni fa abbiamo comprato metà di
una vecchia casa a Moncucco Torinese, 30 km a est di Torino, nelle colline del
Monferrato.
Nella proprietà era incluso un
ettaro abbondante di un vecchio vigneto che produce Freisa, piantato alla fine degli
anni ‘20 del secolo scorso e quindi tra i più antichi impianti del la regione.
(Qui potete trovare
un interessante articolo sul Freisa e la prima foto è stata scattata a circa 1
km da noi, in direzione del castello di Moncucco Torinese in cima alla
collina!).
Inizialmente non sapevamo nulla di
vigneti e di vinificazione, ma non sembrava essere un problema: per circa 20
anni un contadino aveva affittato la vigna dai proprietari precedenti, vendendo
l’uva alla cantina sociale di Castelnuovo Don Bosco. Quando ci siamo incontrati
si è deciso di continuare con l’affitto e abbiamo pensato che avremmo avuto un
sacco di tempo per affrontare la vigna dopo la ristrutturazione della casa.
Presto, però, ci siamo accorti che l’agricoltore
non stava facendo un buon lavoro, probabilmente per l’età avanzata: le piante
non erano potate a dovere, i pali erano instabili e marci, i fili rischiavano
di rompersi e alla base di ogni filare cresceva l’edera, folta e indisturbata.
L’agricoltore intanto aveva capito
di non riuscire a portare avanti il lavoro per problemi di salute e il
contratto è decaduto. Dopo lunghe discussioni abbiamo deciso di fare il passo e
tentare di fare il lavoro da soli. Sapevamo che sarebbe stato un compito
difficile, ma non avevamo idea di quanto ...
Un colpo di fortuna
Tra le persone con cui abbiamo
parlato per avere consigli e dritte sulla vigna, c’è stato Mario Casalegno, agrotecnico con l'hobby di enologia, produttore di vino e proprietario dell’agriturismo Cascina di
maggio, a pochi chilometri da casa nostra. La nostra vigna lo entusiasmava:
grazie a lui abbiamo capito quanto fosse rara e preziosa una simile
combinazione di esposizione, terreno ed età delle piante. Una vigna tanto
vecchia non produce in abbondanza, ma in termini di biodiversità è una risorsa
da tenere in vita.
Mario ha deciso di aiutarci
mettendoci a disposizione il trattore per i trattamenti, le sue competenze per
insegnarci i lavori necessari e la sua cantina per la vinificazione, il tutto
in cambio solo di una parte del vino che avremmo prodotto. Inoltre, prendendo
in carico la vigna, il vino avrebbe avuto la denominazione di origine
controllata, impossibile per noi che non eravamo e non siamo professionisti.
Insomma, ottime premesse e grandi
speranze, ma nonostante tutto il duro lavoro non siamo riusciti a ripristinare
l’intera estensione della vigna: in parte perché ciascuno di noi ha già il
proprio lavoro, in parte perché avremmo avuto bisogno di un investimento
iniziale che superava le nostre possibilità.
Dopo tre anni, la buona notizia è
che siamo riusciti a pulire e ripristinare un terzo della vigna.
Ecco i risultati:
1. questa prima parte del
vigneto è stata potata per restituire alle piante forza e vigore;
2. i peggiori 250/300 pali sono
stati sostituiti (a mano!);
3. i vecchi fili sono stati
sostituiti;
4. abbiamo tagliato e sradicato
l’edera e tanti arbusti che crescevano tra i filari e abbiamo tenuto sotto
controllo le erbacce;
5. abbiamo fatto tutti i
trattamenti necessari contro le malattie, in parte con un piccolo trattore e in
parte a mano con un vaporizzatore a spalla (immaginatevi uno zaino che porta 18
litri) là dove il trattore non poteva arrivare.
Dopo la vendemmia 2013 siamo
riusciti a produrre 800 litri di vino: niente male.
Perché allora abbiamo ancora bisogno d’aiuto?
La sfortuna qualche volta è dietro l’angolo.
Durante i mesi invernali, con l’aiuto di Mario abbiamo potato tutta la vigna e
abbiamo continuato a sostituire i pali peggiori.
La primavera e l’estate del 2014
sono state devastanti per la viticoltura della zona: troppa pioggia e
temperature troppo basse hanno portato con sé malattie come la peronospora,
funghi e muffa. Insomma, l’annus
horribilis dell’ultimo secolo. Per questo il Ministero della Salute ha dato
il permesso di usare trattamenti antimuffa, una sorta di artiglieria pesante
dell’agricoltura che ha bisogno di essere regolamentata per il suo forte
impatto sul DNA della pianta e sull’ambiente in generale.
Noi abbiamo deciso di non usarlo,
non avevamo nessuna intenzione di bere un vino che non ci avrebbe fatto bene.
Una buona scelta per la salute, ma poco lungimirante per le sue conseguenze: nel
2014 non abbiamo avuto nemmeno un grappolo e ancora nel 2015 le piante hanno
continuato a risentire della malattia e hanno prodotto molto poco rispetto al
loro potenziale.
Il pericolo che vorremmo evitare
La spada di Damocle che pende sulla
porzione che non siamo riusciti a lavorare del tutto è la legge: non si può
lasciare una vigna incolta, altrimenti viene sradicata e il proprietario deve
pagare le spese relative (e nel nostro caso sarebbero dai 3.000 ai 5.000 €!).
Perché allora spendere dei soldi che
non abbiamo per rinunciare per sempre a un piccolo patrimonio di tradizione?
Ecco quello che dovremmo fare per salvare la vigna:
1. pulitura completa da
infestanti, viti selvatiche e arbusti, e in più espianto dei vecchi pali e
rimozione dei fili (dovremmo rivolgerci a un’impresa perché è un lavoro che
richiede parecchi giorni e diverse persone specializzate, non potremmo farlo in
tempo nemmeno se volessimo): 2.000 €;
2. acquisto di nuovi pali (ammesso
che li troviamo a un prezzo ragionevolmente basso): 2.000 €;
3. acquisto di nuovi fili:
500 €;
4. collocazione di pali e fili
(anche per questo abbiamo bisogno di professionisti): 1.500 €;
5. trattamenti da fare 6/8 volte
nel 2016 più trinciatura tra i filari: 1.000 €.
Totale:
7.000 €
Con questa
cifra possiamo ripristinare tutta l’estensione del vigneto, tenendo conto che
le piante che abbiamo trascurato nell’ultimo anno ci metteranno un paio d’anni
per tornare pienamente produttive. Da questo momento in poi il nostro vino sarà
venduto attraverso l’agriturismo Cascina di maggio e in questo modo saremo in
grado di sostenere le spese future e, con il passare del tempo, sostituire le
piante mancanti.
Cosa succede se non raggiungiamo tutti i fondi necessari?
Ovviamente continueremo a lavorare
la parte che già abbiamo rimesso a posto e interverremo sulla parte critica in
base alla somma che avremo raggiunto. Più alta sarà la cifra che otterremo, più
grande sarà la superficie che salveremo dall’espianto.
Cosa succede se il finanziamento supera il nostro obiettivo?
Sarebbe quasi troppo bello per
essere vero, ma sappiamo esattamente cos’altro ci servirebbe:
– un piccolo trattore di
seconda mano;
– progettare e stampare le etichette
per le bottiglie;
– acquistare bottiglie vuote di
alta qualità;
– convertire la produzione al
biologico 100 % certificato.
Comunque vada la campagna, metteremo
a frutto ogni centesimo.

Infine, per chi avesse poca dimestichezza con il Freisa, ecco una breve storia.
Il Freisa è uno dei più antichi
vitigni autoctoni della nostra zona ed è documentato già nel XVI secolo. Le
ricerche sul DNA hanno dimostrato che, geneticamente parlando, il Freisa è il
""nonno"" del Nebbiolo, e quindi del Barolo. Tuttavia, negli ultimi 40
anni l’area dedicata al Freisa si è ridotta drasticamente. Negli anni ‘70, infatti,
la fillossera ha colpito l’astigiano così gravemente che la maggior parte dei
vigneti in Piemonte fu ripiantata (per fortuna la nostra è sopravvissuta). Molti
agricoltori decisero di cambiare varietà di vino, perché il Freisa non ha un
grande tasso di produzione per ettaro, né la fama del Nebbiolo o del Barolo. Grandi
e medi viticoltori passarono ad altri vitigni autoctoni che producono fino al
40 % in più di vino per ettaro e il Freisa iniziò a essere usato dalle
grandi aziende come vino da taglio. Molti piccoli produttori, invece,
rinunciarono, vendendo le proprie quote di produzione a grandi aziende. Una
quota corrisponde alla possibilità di piantare a vigna una certa superficie di
terreno, indipendentemente dalla varietà di vite e dalla localizzazione del
terreno. Per esempio: se io compro una quota da un produttore che fa dolcetto
d.o.c. ad Alba, posso piantare uve anche scadenti nel mezzo della nebbiosa
pianura Padana e farne vino da tavola disgustoso.
In un
simile contesto economico e legislativo sentiamo sempre di più l’esigenza di
resistere, nel nostro piccolo, all’“industrializzazione” del cibo: non vogliamo bere vini pieni di
solfiti, non vogliamo mangiare pomodori a dicembre né carne piena di ormoni di
animali che non hanno mai visto la luce del sole. Qualche volta è una scelta
impegnativa, ma siamo sicuri che in tanti, ormai, la pensiamo in questo modo.",11.0,0,"1 Campaign

 /ˈman(t)l/ noun 
The part of an oyster that secretes the calcium carbonate precipitated out into an organic matrix that makes the hard protective shell and often a highly valuable asset, the pearl.
Work should not be lonely, it should be exciting. 
Work should be more than just work, it should be a community. 





Mantle is a co-working space coming to Duling School in the Fondren District of Jackson, Mississippi that brings solo-entrepreneurs, creatives, and small teams together in a work space that promotes free flow of ideas, skills and energy. Working at Mantle provides metro-area entrepreneurs and small teams the office space that is less expensive than traditional offices and more reliable and business-oriented than the coffee shop down the street or your own living room or garage.

Funding and Returns
 Reaching both monetary and member goals are essential to starting this awesome offering. Due to the new nature of this concept in the Jackson area, hitting member goals in the pre-pay and reservation stage will show that this community-centric workspace is something that Jacksonians want and need.
Mantle has no obligation to take any funding offers. Any funding offered that is not taken by Mantle will be returned upon closing of the campaign. Returns of raised funds are returned in the following manner due to the type of funding purchased:


Pre-pay Grade: If accepted, no advance returns. Returns may be made if a full-year membership is subsequently made by a third party and replaces the pre-paid membership. Returns may be made in monthly payments for the remainder of the original pre-paid term. Non-accepted returns will be made in a timely fashion.

Reservation Grade: If accepted, no returns, unless Mantle does not honor the reservation due to capacity limits. Non-accepted returns will be made in a timely fashion.





Other Perks Information:* Purchasers of more expensive Perks get priority of spot reservations in the chance that this campaign oversubscribes. In cases where two purchasers for the same spot purchased the same Perk with only one spot on the line, the one that purchased first in time gets that spot.
** T-shirt purchases are held for pick-up in Jackson, Mississippi at Mantle. If you would like your t-shirt shipped to you, contact mantle@pearlbend.com after you completed the purchase of your Perk and we can work with you to get you your t-shirt.

It’s not the back room of a bar or the basement of some funky restaurant. It is a venue we fully operate and call home: The Experiment Comedy Gallery.<p>Located at 20 Broadway in the South Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, The Experiment Comedy Gallery— The Gallery, for short — is the headquarters for hot, hip alternative comedy — from standup to storytelling, sketch to improv, and more — in a hot, hip neighborhood that’s been underserved when it comes to affordable live comedy. Ticket prices range from $5 to $15 per person. Some shows are even free. Seven nights a week, 52 weeks a year.</p>
<p>The Gallery also plays host to pop culture-centric art shows, trivia events, comedy classes, web video shoots (like the video you've watched on this page) and screenings, podcast recordings, and more. It’s an all-purpose space for all things funny.</p>

(Quick note: Ticketfly.com was just acquired by Pandora, the popular streaming music site.)

The feeling we all had that day was like walking hand in hand with god. Seriously Cool, No other way to say it...

One of the best moments of my entire life was going out with my son Matthew and some friends  to hand out some coats. It was a great experience, seeing the light of gratitude on BOTH my own son and the deserving people whose lives got better as a result of his generosity. The TRUE benefactor in ANY act of charity, after all is Always the giver… It was in this moment, that GoodYork was born…. We pledged to shine a light on ordinary people doing extraordinarily kind things. We believe that the media depicts the majority of people as uncaring, and self-centered, looking out for only themselves, and that's just NOT how the world works from our perspective.

Short Summary

</div><h2><b>Help Launch
a Community Dispute Resolution Centre for the South Shore!</b></h2>
<p>A group of organizations
(including South Shore Community Justice Society, Bridgewater Police Services, Harbour House, and Second Story Women’s Centre) along with interested individuals
across the South Shore has come together to create a Community Dispute
Resolution Centre (CDRC) in Bridgewater, Nova Scotia. </p>
<p>As a program of the South
Shore Community Justice Society, <b>the mission</b> of
the CDRC is to provide tools, education, and services that empower people to
peacefully resolve their own conflicts using restorative approaches and
practices. <b>The vision</b> is to foster
safe, peaceful communities through the use of restorative approaches and
practices.</p>
<p>Our trained volunteer mediators
will provide individuals, organizations, and businesses in our community with
assistance in resolving non-criminal conflicts efficiently, effectively, fairly, and by mutual agreement.  This program is completely voluntary. The CDRC will also be a resource to educate and train the
citizens, giving them the tools to address conflict constructively and
positively in order to build a peaceful community. </p>
<h2><b>What
is a “Restorative Approach”?</b></h2>
<p><i>Restorative
approach</i> to conflict focuses on providing a safe and supportive space for
all parties to share their perspectives, foster understanding of the situation
that caused conflict, and providing support for parties to work collaboratively
to avoid future conflict and rebuild damaged relationships. This approach
developed as an alternative to traditionally punitive systems that focuses on
“wrongdoers” being alienated from the community. This often results in a
further breakdown of feelings of connection and responsibility to their
community, while simultaneously offering little opportunity for victims to be
heard, and little freedom for the parties to work together for mutually
beneficial solutions.</p>
<h2><b>What
Services Will the Program Offer?</b></h2>
<p>Services will include:</p>
<p><i>Mediation:</i>This is a process where a
trained third person, regarded as neutral by the people with the dispute,
assists the disputants to talk about the conflict and come to a resolution that
is mutually satisfactory and agreed upon, and which the parties agree ends the
conflict.</p>
<p><i>Facilitation:</i>  The volunteer
mediators will also offer facilitation services when the resolution of a
problem or dispute would benefit from a group discussion format. Facilitation
is an efficient and effective way for groups to discuss a problem thoroughly
and reach practical, realistic solutions.</p><p><i>Community Education and Outreach:</i> The CDRC will offer conflict resolution training and education to schools, businesses, and community groups with the ultimate goal of building conflict resolution capacity in the community.</p>
<h2><b>What Can You Do?  </b></h2>
<p>The CDRC will benefit not just
individuals, but the entire South Shore—through education, trainings, and a
gradual transformation of the culture. We’ve come a long way towards making the
CDRC a reality… but we need your help! The dedication of many participating
organizations and volunteers has gotten us through the planning stages, and now
we need to raise an additional $5,000 to pay for mediator training, office
supplies, and other start-up costs to make this vision a reality. </p>
<p><b>We
count on the support of individuals like you</b> to help make the South Shore
of Nova Scotia a more peaceful place to live.</p>
<p>We have an incredible team of
representatives from interested non-profits and community members who are
giving their time to make this happen. We need money to pay for things like:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Mediator training</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Publicity and promotional materials</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Office supplies</p>

<p>Cultivate &amp; Nest is the physical space that will be shared by the Cultivate Community. A growing group of people in the Pioneer Valley of Western MA who are committed to being great entrepreneurs and even better parents. Our goal is to provide not only a physical space where you can come get all your work done but where your child can be stimulated and enriched simultaneously. No more days feeling totally isolated and staying up after baby goes to bed desperately trying to get your work done before you collapse. At Cultivate, you'll have more resources including professional workspace, amenities like meeting space, free coffee and especially moral support and creative collaboration with other families just like yours! In an on site (but separate) space, your preschooler will get healthy socialization and fun, enriching curriculum while being safely supervised by a loving and licensed early childhood professional. Think of what even just 2 hours of totally focused work per day could do for your business...and your sanity! We also plan to make available a true community space where we can share our skills, our wisdom and creativity through workshops and events that help us all grow.</p>

</ul> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Cultivate is brand new...like screaming, red-faced newborn new. We need everything from good office furniture to a projector for our community meeting space. We need books and toys and art supplies for the little ones...and of course a good coffee maker!  While we are grateful for all the awesome donations of physical stuff we are collecting, we know that there will still be a lot of things that we just won't be lucky enough to get as gifts. In a perfect world - one where we got fully funded- we will be leasing the space right next door so we can have a bigger, better Nest space and a very large space available for events on a larger scale. Getting funded would give us boat loads more confidence during this start up phase.</p> <ul> <li>We are asking for $20,000 in total but EVERYTHING HELPS!  That money will be used to prepay the lease a bit to take pressure off of our founding members as we advocate to grow our community over the first few months. It will also allow us to expand into the larger event and childcare space right away which makes us an even better community asset. It will also be nice to have a little to put into some high quality amenities like a projector and some security measures and goodies to keep our babies educationally entertained, like curriculum and activity supplies. We also hope to get a professional upgrade to our management software and website!</li> <li>It was super important to us, when we thought of what we could use to recognize your generosity, and we wanted it to be GOOD!  At every level, we will be honoring the donor with a handmade flag on a beautiful strand of bunting that will be hung in our space all the way through our grand opening in February, so everyone will know who helped us along the way! You could also get an awesome 'mommy and me' coloring kit that Terra drew personally! We will ship it right to you!  There's marketing opportunities for you and your small business by way of shout outs and even sponsorships of our grand opening event and special projects. And of course, there's lots of ways to support us(and get to know us!) by getting preordered memberships to the space!</li>

When I was pregnant, I couldn't imagine how I was going to do it 'all'. And the crazy part, is that I have it just about as easy as a mom could. My business was thriving, I had an INCREDIBLE team (thank you Lynn, Falecia, Andrew, Dan, Sarah, Emily, Susie, Valerie and Eric!) I also had a partner in life, business and everything...and yet, it was still intimidating like crazy!  The idea behind C &amp; N is that by pulling together, we become a safety net for one another during this amazing and transformational time for our lives, our businesses, our identities and our spirits.</p>

It’s called Vegan Xpress, and the purpose is to show people that vegan food and fast food need not be mutually exclusive categories. At Vegan Xpress, we serve only the finest vegan dishes, and we do so as quickly and conveniently as possible, making it easier for people to stick to their diets and stay healthy and responsible.</p><p>In addition to serving food, we also feature in-house entertainment (every other Thursday) by showcasing local talents within our community, which also includes my own singing. Singing is a long-time profession of mine, something that I love to do and still do quit often, and it would be my honor to share this gift of mine with all of my customers. In addition to the restaurant Vegan Xpress offers catering services and cooking workshops. This in return gives people the basic knowledge, tools, and skills to help them create their very own favorite plant based meals.</p><p>Veganism is a concept that is here to stay in Israel. The number of vegans within the country is staggering, and the youngest generations are statistically much more likely to be vegan than ever before. Vegan Xpress is a place where not only vegans, but also people of all diversity, can get away from the tension that is often a part of life in Israel and break some proverbial bread together.</p><p>I believe in this concept. I know that there is a market for it here in Mitzpe Ramon, and I want to serve that market. On top of that, this restaurant will make it possible for my husband and I to provide for our family. Vegan Xpress is a restaurant for the people of Mitzpe Ramon, yes, but it is also for anyone looking for a unique experience through taste &amp; service while embracing the nature around you.</p><p> </p><p><strong>A Little Bit About Chef Britney Monique</strong></p><p>Originally from Raleigh, North Carolina, she relocated to Israel with her dad about twenty years ago. Today her home is in Mitzpe Ramon (southern), Israel, a place known as much for its beauty as it is for its pleasant atmosphere and wonderful people.</p><ol>
<li>Married of seven years, and has a step-son serving in the army, and two beautiful daughters.</li>
<li>Last February, Britney graduated from Le Cordon Blue School of Culinary Arts, earning her Bachelor of Arts in Culinary Management.</li>
<li>For almost four years prior to that, she worked as the Head Chef and Restaurant Manager at Ramon Smart Hotels in Mitzpe Ramon. She enjoyed that position greatly, and it was only in order to start her own business that she ever stopped working there.</li>
<li>Britney’s specialty when it comes to the kitchen is vegan cuisine. The inspiration stems from marrying her husband who has been vegan all his life. Knowing this forced her to create dishes/ food alternatives that she had once loved to eat into something more healthier that even her husband could enjoy. She has learned a lot over the years, but time and again, Britney has been drawn back to this one area of cooking, this area in which she excels and this area in which she takes great pride. In vegan cuisine, the ingredients are limitless and the possibilities remain endless. She states “I get excited to step into the kitchen every day, knowing that I am using my creativity for the benefit of others and doing so in a healthy and positive manner”.</li>
</ol><p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p><ol>
<li>Winter is coming and because of how are restaurant is set-up (seating arrangements are out side and exposed to nature and the elements) it will make it impossible for people to enjoy their dinning experience, for it gets brutally cold with the winds coming from the Ramon crater “Makhtesh” during the winter months. Closing is not an option, but expansion and renovation of the area is, but it comes with a hefty cost that has put my family at a temporary financial stand still.</li>
<li>We always look to elevate our level of service by supplying our customers with the best. A portion of our menu is based upon an oil free concept but we want to take it a step further by incorporating dishes that are gluten free, and also present uncooked “raw” dishes as well. In order to do so special equipment and ingredients would need to be purchased and in a couple of instances imported into the country.</li>
<li>  Giving our name “Vegan Xpress” we strive to serve our customers as quick as possible. Being that my husband and I are the only ones handling taking orders, making the foods/drinks, serving, and cleaning, at some point that quick service ends up being a much longer wait than expected. We wanted to first hire a chef that could help me push the food out much quicker and help in the creation/elevation of healthier dishes to provide for our customers. We found the perfect person for the job! Meenkah Fowler single mother of three is also vegan and already knows how to work with me (she was my sous chef at Ramon Smart Hotel for 2 years) and working under pressure is her specialty. I promised her that if I ever opened my own restaurant that she had to be on my team but I also wanted to make sure that she would be paid accordingly so financially it wouldn’t become a burden on her as she takes care of her 3 young boys. A portion of these funds will be going to a couple months salary for this amazing young woman that I know will help me succeed in this business. By adding more members to our team ensures that we can keep up with supply and demand meaning we will be able to extend work days and hours!</li>
</ol><p>We are ready to move forward with our restaurant immediately, but we need your help. I am turning to you in order to raise $55,000. This start-up capital is going to cover the costs of renovation, help us buy much needed equipment/ingredients, marketing, salary coverage for hiring greatly need staff, and operating Vegan Xpress in general, making the vegan lifestyle more sustainable, comfortable and enjoyable for Mitzpe Ramon at least!  </p><p><u>Here is a list as to where the money raised will help go towards:</u></p><p>Meat/Cheese Slicer: $1080 for slicing our signature meat/cheese alternatives ultra thin</p><p>Wood-Fired oven: $2000 for baking pizzas</p><p>Industrial Food Processor: $1500</p><p>Industrial blender: $1300</p><p>Industrial Air Fryer: $2700</p><p>Tortilla Press/Maker  $89.99 (for making gluten free flatbreads)</p><p>Refrigeration $2,500</p><p>Back-up Generator $2700 (we live in the middle of nowhere and when winter hits it tends to wipe out the electricity).</p><p>Deep Freezers $2,500</p><p>Industrial Post &amp; Pans and serving plates/utensils $2500(for catering up to 100 people)</p><p>Website design and marketing $350</p><p>Salary coverage for staff member (for first 6 months) $6400</p><p>Food Truck: $15550 (importation) to be used to serve neighboring kibbutzs  twice a week (again there is no vegan restaurant within a 70 km/43 miles radius)</p><p>Expansion/Renovation/$13830 (also includes fees associated with expansion via the “city hall” municipality standards)</p><p><u>In return for your support here are some awesome perks you will receive:</u></p><p>*Everyone that donates name will be carved on a handmade wooden plank that will be placed on our wall for all to see. </p><p><strong>$20</strong><br/><u>Social Media Recognition</u>  (from donations of $1 to $20) &amp; a personal email saying thank you!</p><p><strong>$30</strong></p><p><u>Vegan Xpress Discount</u> (from $21 to $49)</p><p>A 15% discount off first order at Vegan Xpress + social media recognition</p><p><strong>$50</strong></p><p><u>Free Lunch Xpress </u>(from donation of $50 to $100)</p><p>Free Sandwich of your choice, fries, Salad, and fruit smoothie + Social Media Recognition</p><p> </p><p><strong>$100</strong></p><p><u>Vegan Xpress’s Signature Cashew Cheesecake</u>  (serves 8 people)</p><p> Free signature cheesecake with topping of your choice + Social Media Recognition + 15% discount off first order.</p><p><strong>$200</strong></p><p><u>Vegan Xpress’s Signature Bacon-less</u></p><p> Free Vegan Xpress Signature Slab “homemade vegan bacon” sliced to perfection, which you can cook within the comfort of your home + Social Media Recognition + 15% discount off first order.</p><p><strong>$500</strong></p><p><u>Vegan Xpress One-on-One Training</u></p><p>Enjoy 7 private cooking classes that are sure to help you prepare awesome vegan meals that you and your family can enjoy! + social media recognition+ 15% discount off first order</p><p><strong>$1000</strong></p><p><u>Vegan Xpress Private Diner for 4</u><br/>Private dinner for up to 4 people + + social media recognition+ 15% discount off first order + free Xpress cheesecake</p><p><strong>$5000</strong></p><p><u>Vegan Xpress Catering Event</u><br/>A catered event of up to 40 people &amp; social media recognition!!!!!!</p><p> </p><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p><p>Fortunately for the cities in both central and Northern Israel the high demand for vegan alternative menus can be found just minutes a part from each other. That leisure dwindles quickly the further south you travel, and by the time you reach Mitzpe Ramon it’s little to non-existence.</p><p>Mitzpe Ramon is a tourist city thanks to the crater, meaning we can now provide vegan meals for the hundreds of thousands of tourist that pass by our town on a daily bases. We are the only “all vegan” establishment within a 70-km/43 miles radius!</p><p>I have over 10 + years of experience in the culinary industry and with that experience I want to provide healthy and tasty options on a universal level.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p><p>Of course, starting and being able to manage &amp; maintain a restaurant is risky business and challenging, but by being able to provide for our community and tourist from all over, our goal is undoubtedly achievable. We did not wait for this campaign to start to begin our dream of Vegan Xpress. We have used all of what savings we have been blessed with to jumpstart this project and get to the point we are at now. With prior years of experience within the food industry we have the tenacity to do what it takes to ensure that our customers continue to receive nothing less than simply the best here at Vegan Xpress!</p><p> </p><p>If we don't reach our monetary goal by the end of this campaign, we will purchase what we can with the funds we raise on a priority basis. And of course, we will continue to work hard to save for the rest so we can actualize our full dream for Vegan Xpress. </p><p> </p><p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p><p>We know that everyone can’t afford to donate monetarily, but hopefully after reading and learning about our campaign it will leave you inspired.

We found the perfect person for the job! Meenkah Fowler single mother of three is also vegan and already knows how to work with me (she was my sous chef at Ramon Smart Hotel for 2 years) and working under pressure is her specialty. I promised her that if I ever opened my own restaurant that she had to be on my team but I also wanted to make sure that she would be paid accordingly so financially it wouldn’t become a burden on her as she takes care of her 3 young boys. A portion of these funds will be going to a couple months salary for this amazing young woman that I know will help me succeed in this business. By adding more members to our team ensures that we can keep up with supply and demand meaning we will be able to extend work days and hours!
We are ready to move forward with our restaurant immediately, but we need your help. I am turning to you in order to raise $55,000. This start-up capital is going to cover the costs of renovation, help us buy much needed equipment/ingredients, marketing, salary coverage for hiring greatly need staff, and operating Vegan Xpress in general, making the vegan lifestyle more sustainable, comfortable and enjoyable for Mitzpe Ramon at least!  Here is a list as to where the money raised will help go towards:Meat/Cheese Slicer: $1080 for slicing our signature meat/cheese alternatives ultra thinWood-Fired oven: $2000 for baking pizzasIndustrial Food Processor: $1500Industrial blender: $1300Industrial Air Fryer: $2700Tortilla Press/Maker  $89.99 (for making gluten free flatbreads)Refrigeration $2,500Back-up Generator $2700 (we live in the middle of nowhere and when winter hits it tends to wipe out the electricity).Deep Freezers $2,500Industrial Post & Pans and serving plates/utensils $2500(for catering up to 100 people)Website design and marketing $350Salary coverage for staff member (for first 6 months) $6400Food Truck: $15550 (importation) to be used to serve neighboring kibbutzs  twice a week (again there is no vegan restaurant within a 70 km/43 miles radius)Expansion/Renovation/$13830 (also includes fees associated with expansion via the “city hall” municipality standards)In return for your support here are some awesome perks you will receive:*Everyone that donates name will be carved on a handmade wooden plank that will be placed on our wall for all to see. $20Social Media Recognition  (from donations of $1 to $20) & a personal email saying thank you!$30Vegan Xpress Discount (from $21 to $49)A 15% discount off first order at Vegan Xpress + social media recognition$50Free Lunch Xpress (from donation of $50 to $100)Free Sandwich of your choice, fries, Salad, and fruit smoothie + Social Media Recognition $100Vegan Xpress’s Signature Cashew Cheesecake  (serves 8 people) Free signature cheesecake with topping of your choice + Social Media Recognition + 15% discount off first order.$200Vegan Xpress’s Signature Bacon-less Free Vegan Xpress Signature Slab “homemade vegan bacon” sliced to perfection, which you can cook within the comfort of your home + Social Media Recognition + 15% discount off first order.$500Vegan Xpress One-on-One TrainingEnjoy 7 private cooking classes that are sure to help you prepare awesome vegan meals that you and your family can enjoy! + social media recognition+ 15% discount off first order$1000Vegan Xpress Private Diner for 4Private dinner for up to 4 people + + social media recognition+ 15% discount off first order + free Xpress cheesecake$5000Vegan Xpress Catering EventA catered event of up to 40 people & social media recognition!!!!!! The ImpactFortunately for the cities in both central and Northern Israel the high demand for vegan alternative menus can be found just minutes a part from each other. That leisure dwindles quickly the further south you travel, and by the time you reach Mitzpe Ramon it’s little to non-existence.Mitzpe Ramon is a tourist city thanks to the crater, meaning we can now provide vegan meals for the hundreds of thousands of tourist that pass by our town on a daily bases. We are the only “all vegan” establishment within a 70-km/43 miles radius!I have over 10 + years of experience in the culinary industry and with that experience I want to provide healthy and tasty options on a universal level. Risks & ChallengesOf course, starting and being able to manage & maintain a restaurant is risky business and challenging, but by being able to provide for our community and tourist from all over, our goal is undoubtedly achievable. We did not wait for this campaign to start to begin our dream of Vegan Xpress. We have used all of what savings we have been blessed with to jumpstart this project and get to the point we are at now. With prior years of experience within the food industry we have the tenacity to do what it takes to ensure that our customers continue to receive nothing less than simply the best here at Vegan Xpress! If we don't reach our monetary goal by the end of this campaign, we will purchase what we can with the funds we raise on a priority basis. And of course, we will continue to work hard to save for the rest so we can actualize our full dream for Vegan Xpress.  Other Ways You Can HelpWe know that everyone can’t afford to donate monetarily, but hopefully after reading and learning about our campaign it will leave you inspired. We ask that you share our IndieGogo campaign through any social media outlets -- but especially those that allow you to link back to this page! You can find us on social media here:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/veganxpress777/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/veganxpress777/Twitter: https://twitter.com/beautifulsong77 Thank you to all whom have helped us and will help us make the dream of Vegan Xpress an unbelievable tangible reality!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Our Team</strong></p>
<p>I’m Steve Lemke and together with my partners, Kelly Lattig, and Jeff Reisinger, we are Adventurous Stills.  Our mission is to bring our sense of adventure to distilling whiskey and spirits with flavors you’ll love.  We became friends while enjoying adventures in Arizona – hiking, backpacking, climbing and biking, to name a few.  We also enjoyed making homebrewed beer.  One day we decided to see if we could take our fun a step further and turn beer into whiskey.  One thing led to another, and here we are – about to open our own local Craft Distillery!</p>
<p><strong>Our Adventure</strong></p>
</div><p>Our whiskey is made slowly using copper pot stills, which develop deep rich nuances and full-grain flavors that continuous-flow stills used by large distillers strip out.  They compromise to increase profits and efficiency at the cost of flavor and character—we do not!   We have custom designed and hand-crafted both of our 100% copper stills.  We have taken the time to truly understand the science of distilling.   Our design ensures that our whiskey retains the character, depth, and richness you expect from a handcrafted whiskey.  And we didn’t stop with the stills.  Each grain used in the making of whiskey has its own unique character and flavor.  The main ingredients; barley, corn, wheat, and rye are great on their own or mixed together.  We go beyond the usual and experiment with toasted wheat, crystal malted barley, red rye, chocolate malts, and “heritage grains” such as spelt, farrow, millet, quinoa, etc.  The possibilities are endless, as is the Adventure.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473697297/jtx7ej6num0qxvfnj0vr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>Join Us</strong></p><p>Our distillery is fully self-financed and we have no debt.  Each partner has already contributed enough funds to get our business rolling including all our equipment, licensing fees, initial raw materials, site improvements, and rent.  As soon as our distillery is up and running, we plan to ‘lay up’ as much whiskey as we can in oak casks to begin the aging process.  All of the funds collected from our Indiegogo campaign will be used to distill more whiskey.  Your dollars will help to create more great handcrafted whiskey for you to enjoy!</p><p><strong>Perks</strong></p><p>Come visit us.  Take a tour of our facility, and enjoy a taste of the whiskey you helped make.

<h3>Helping Us Help Cambodia</h3>
<p>Be part of our project to help us help Cambodia by retaining agricultural profits in Cambodia, by introducing high paying skilled jobs for Cambodians, and by introducing a whole new industry (craft distilling) and vastly improving old ones (<i>e.g.</i> palm sugar processing).</p>
<h3>A Brief History</h3>
<p>I conceived this idea in 2005 while attending a wine class at Clear Creek Distillery in Portland, Oregon.  After trying their amazing pear brandy, and talking to Dennis McCarthy - a legendary figure in the craft distilling industry - I realized all I needed was the right place for the fruit, and the right person for a partner !</p>
<p>Flash to 2013 - while visiting Cambodia to attend a wedding, I met RJ, my Cambodian partner. While drinking a bottle of pear brandy I had brought with me, we discussed mangoes and other tropical fruits.  RJ is not only a US college graduate - he has his own mango and fruit farms in Cambodia.  And most importantly, <i>he has a strong drive to help his fellow Cambodians and to help develop his native country</i>.</p>
<h3>What we've done</h3>
<p>By 2014 we had begun perfecting our recipes with a small still, and by 2015 had formed our company.  In 2016, we brought in a professional US distiller from Portland, Oregon to begin employee training.  We have partnered with a major US importer of craft spirits and US distributor.  We are now near completion of our building, and we are in the process of importing commercial craft distilling equipment from around the world.</p>
<h3>What we Need</h3>
<p>We've had a  500 liter copper still custom built in China by a leader in craft distilling equipment.  <strong>We need an additional $19,375</strong> to pay off the balance, ship, and install it in our new building in Sihanoukville Province, Cambodia.  <i>There is nothing like it in Cambodia</i>; and will allow us to immediately begin full production of our mango and cashew fruit brandies, as well as our palm sugar rhum.</p>
<p>Invest in our project and receive some of our unique and exclusive Cambodian perks !</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490479466/hqfll9s7gdhwlds3rbuo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Cambodia is a third world country, but is rich in agricultural products. Most of these are not yet processed in Cambodia.  Because of the lack of infrastructure, they are shipped to Thailand or Vietnam, where the bulk of the profits go.  Bayon Distillery - a Cambodian company - is not only adding brand new infrastructure to Cambodia, it is retaining the profits in Cambodia as well.  </p>
<p>Some of the profits will go to employees paid well above the national rate for factory or agricultural workers; and the rest will go to future infrastructure projects, such as a cashew processing plant.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Although we have proofed (sorry !) many of our ideas, concepts, and recipes over the last 3 years, we have not operated at full scale yet.  And although our spirits have been beta tested repeatedly through multiple tastings, there is no guarantee that they will be accepted by the US market.  Mangoes, palm sugar, tamarind, mangosteen .... they are all exotic fruits that relatively few Americans have tried.  But we think it is the very exotic nature of Cambodia's fruits and spices that will be it's biggest draw !</p>

<h3>A Little About Us</h3>
<p>We, Young and Michal Bennett, are devoted partners, both in life and as owners of Coffee Roboto. We love coffee and bikes, work hard, and don’t take anything for granted. With our little mobile venture, we want to bring a connective coffee experience to our city and culture. Plain and simple, we will brew good coffee, promote sustainability and fair trade, and give back to our community.</p>
<p>With a customized coffee tricycle that is being designed and built for us by <a href=""http://www.haleytrikes.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Haley Tricycles</a> in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, we will pedal to set locations around town, park, and serve cold and hot coffee. We are also making our own syrups, sodas and chai. And then, one day soon, we will rule the world.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have paid the deposit on our tricycle, and it is scheduled to arrive in July. We have also gathered some of the equipment and supplies that we need, taken care of the required licenses, and set up contracts with our vendors, suppliers, and locations. Here are a few things we still need in order to get brewing and on the road. </p>
<p>·      Trike Expenses – build out, sink, umbrella, bike hardware, storage, signage, menu board</p>
<p>·      Brewing &amp; Storage Equipment – coffee bean canisters, water canisters, cold bags, refrigerator, miscellaneous brewing equipment</p>
<p>·      Startup Expenses – coffee, chai, milk, shrub ingredients, syrup ingredients, cups, lids, water, etc. </p>
<p>·      Other Expenses – marketing expenses, crowdfunding fees, perk costs, etc.</p>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>We have put together a variety of coffee-related and locally-crafted gifts to thank you for your generosity. Pictured below are the You Can Do It Kit ($500 pledge),  the limited edition 8-ounce mug handcrafted by <a href=""http://www.chriskelseyceramics.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Chris Kelsey</a> at <a href=""http://www.tracksidestudio.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Trackside Studio</a> in Spokane, WA (each will be unique - $100 Pledge), and the <a href=""https://www.etsy.com/listing/279736630/letterpress-coffee-card-lovers-come-go?ref=shop_home_active_4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Card Co Lab letterpress coffee card</a> ($15 pledge and up).

<h3>If We Don't Reach Our Goal</h3>
<p>If we don’t reach our entire goal, we will first put funds towards paying for the tricycle itself and the components needed to finish out the build when it arrives. We will then start with serving at just a few locations until we are able to fund more service.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Making a Difference</h3>
<p>We have spent the past year serving great coffee, seasonal handmade shrub sodas, and chai at our monthly Pop Up Cafes in Coeur d’Alene and Post Falls. Anyone who knows us – and the Robot – knows that we love coffee and bicycles. With our tricycle, we will continue our dedication to serving simple coffee drinks, supporting local and sustainable living, and bringing a fresh experience to our community.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>In starting our mobile coffee business a year ago, we had no delusions about the risks and challenges we would encounter. It has been a thrilling time of growing and developing. Of course, we still worry about failure, rejection, and profitability. We definitely have our doubts and insecurities! But we will continue to put ourselves out there and discover the possibilities of our dream.</p>
<p>Our promise to you is that we will provide first-rate customer service and the most exceptional cup of coffee we can conceive. We will lose sleep over the best brew methods and the next best coffee roast we can find. And we will work hard to answer your questions, remember your drink and sincerely serve each and every person who chooses Coffee Roboto.</p>

<p>My name is Lisa McFadin, and I am the founder of Duvin.  That's a title, but the truth is the community is the founder of Duvin.  There have been so many people that continue to support this endeavor on a daily basis, that I can't keep track.  This has definitely become a cooperative, and without you, Duvin would be just another idea.</p>
<p>In order to move to the next level, a few things have to happen.  We need capital.  I have been working a few jobs in order to sustain this business, and bring it to where we are now.  But now I need to focus, and create the foundation by success.  Not by working night and day, but by asking for capital, and doing it the right way.  We've been here for 13 months through blood, sweat and tears.  Please help me make this happen. </p>
<p>We are not asking for a lot, but we do need some equipment, we need to clear some vendor accounts, and we need to have a capital supply to staff the kitchen for 6 months.  If you can't contribute money, can you contribute time or equipment?  We will take it all.</p>

<h3>Like many of our fellow bitcoin/cryptocurency miners out there, we too have been bamboozled by Hashocean. Given the fact that many of these cloud mining companies are basically Ponzi schemes, or offer a really low return, we have decided that it is best not to give credence to these surreptitious operations and venture into starting a company of our own.<br/>Let me begin by saying that we are family folk...Everyday people trying to make ends meet and invest for the future. We believe in integrity and treating others the way you want to be treated. With that in mind, our vision is to create a safe haven for all of us to mine, with a company that is completely transparent and run honestly. We have the technological expertise to make this happen, but lack the funding to see it come to fruition. This is where you come in.... <br/>Alot of us are irate from being hoodwinked and are disheartened and frustrated with all the charlatan and sham cloud mining companies out there. Here's your chance to take the bull by the horns and make that change. We realize that a lot of people have lost hundreds, thousands and even millions of their hard earned dollars because of Hashocean. We do not expect anyone to make a hefty donation.... Even a mere dollar, or two would be greatly appreciated. The idea is to get as many people as possible on the bandwagon and to donate to this cause. Together, we can make this a reality.<br/>Feel free to repost and share this with friends and family, as well as fellow miners and anyone who believes in what we're trying to achieve. Help us help you, by helping us reach our goal, so that we may all reap the rewards of mining with peace of mind. <br/>Thank you.</h3>

</div></div>","Like many of our fellow bitcoin/cryptocurency miners out there, we too have been bamboozled by Hashocean. Given the fact that many of these cloud mining companies are basically Ponzi schemes, or offer a really low return, we have decided that it is best not to give credence to these surreptitious operations and venture into starting a company of our own.Let me begin by saying that we are family folk...Everyday people trying to make ends meet and invest for the future. We believe in integrity and treating others the way you want to be treated. With that in mind, our vision is to create a safe haven for all of us to mine, with a company that is completely transparent and run honestly. We have the technological expertise to make this happen, but lack the funding to see it come to fruition. This is where you come in.... Alot of us are irate from being hoodwinked and are disheartened and frustrated with all the charlatan and sham cloud mining companies out there. Here's your chance to take the bull by the horns and make that change. We realize that a lot of people have lost hundreds, thousands and even millions of their hard earned dollars because of Hashocean. We do not expect anyone to make a hefty donation.... Even a mere dollar, or two would be greatly appreciated. The idea is to get as many people as possible on the bandwagon and to donate to this cause. Together, we can make this a reality.Feel free to repost and share this with friends and family, as well as fellow miners and anyone who believes in what we're trying to achieve. Help us help you, by helping us reach our goal, so that we may all reap the rewards of mining with peace of mind. Thank you.

<p>Today’s environmental issues are not something we can afford to ignore.</p>
<p><strong>lluvia</strong> is a simple and modern way for you to address an issue regarding one of our most precious resources:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474483117/rcgqogenxhl2aoupiuc9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>With <strong>lluvia</strong> you can help conserve your region’s water supply and reduce runoff ocean pollution by reusing the rain that fell on your roof. It provides a sustainable, secondary source of water.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473792160/vel2jfpmjtyzev0jzsgi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>With continuous severe drought, Los Angeles and other cities in California revised their building codes to encourage rainwater harvesting. In Los Angeles, starting July of 2014, any renovation over 50% required installation of rain barrels. As an architectural design firm located in Santa Monica, we had many modern home projects in the affected areas. When it was time to purchase the rain barrels for our clients, the search was exhausting and frustrating. Somehow the word ‘barrel’ stuck the design of rain barrels somewhere in the Stone Age or a wild west saloon. We learned that most home owners removed these eye-sores after the final inspections. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473792074/fe2bziqedcyzd1ufwq9f.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>So we set out to design a better rainwater harvesting system that any modern home owner can be proud to display in their yards. The design process started with distilling the essence of modern home design: in form, materials, and proportions. Most 'barrels' in the market have a capacity of 40-60 gallons, and the average 2,000Sq.Ft. home would need around 10 of these to meet the requirements. We also pushed it further by integrating filtering technologies to expand the rainwater harvesting system’s applicability: a planter with a self-watering system, an outdoor shower, a water feature fountain with re-circulating pump, and a drinking fountain for pets.</p>
<p>We are at our final stage of engineering and prototyping, and hope to go into production by January of 2017. </p>
<p>If you contribute to fund our campaign, you will be helping to spread  <strong>lluvia</strong> in many backyards across the globe, consequently saving millions of gallons of water, one raindrop at a time!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, all! My name is Chloe, and my business partner (and dear friend) Suzanne and I are in the process of opening a women's clothing and lifestyle boutique in Columbus, Ohio. Before The Sunroom became a shared dream, it was an individual one for myself and Suzanne. After meeting we became fast friends, and many coffees and conversations later we realized that we shared the same vision: to create a positive and supportive space where all women feel welcome and find clothing that makes them feel confident.</p>
<p>We chose The Sunroom as the name of our shop because we strive to create a warm, inviting atmosphere. We want everyone who walks through our doors to feel included and that feeling comes from offering a wide variety of styles to many sizes and body types, but most importantly it comes from Suzanne and myself. We strive to offer the best service, to always be honest,and gain the trust of our shoppers, and to create friendships with everyone who walks through our doors. People are our passion, and we're not just envisioning a clothing store, but a community space. </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>We're striving to raise $15,000 to help us with operating and start-up costs including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remodeling/Rent. We have fallen in love with a retail space in the heart of Clintonville. It is in a high foot traffic area, and directly in-between two of our favorite places in the neighborhood: Dough Mama and Whits! The space has an interesting past (music studio turned massage parlor) and needs some interior renovations to make it right for us, but there is SO much potential. After removing the current floors, making everything ADA compliant, and slappin' on a fresh coat of paint, it will be ready to go! The extra funds will help facilitate these renovations. And once complete, the space will be able to host workshops, pop-up shops with other vendors, and many other gatherings. </li>
<li>Product Ordering for Fall. We are taking out a small business loan and part of that capital is for our Spring/Summer orders. The sales from those goods will contribute greatly to our Fall merchandise, however in order to continue to grow our business we hope to expand our inventory and additional funding will play a large role in that.</li>
<li>Extra $ for Workshops and Community Gatherings! We are most excited about the positive impact our space will have on the Clintonville community. While planning our business we have received so much vital guidance from so many local business owners and it is very important to us that we pay that forward. We would love to be able to purchase items like folding chairs/tables and other event supplies so we can welcome as many members of the community as possible to our special events.</li>
</ul>

Our Home Space</a><br/>- a platform for conscious consumption</h2><p>The web portal<a href=""https://ourhomespace.myshopify.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Our Home Space</a> is being set up with this campaign. The goal of the page is to enable us to initiate and/or sponsor community projects that empower locals to improve their lives in parts of the world where we see how we easily, with the help of our allies* can make a positive change in the life of a community.</p><p>One such easy way is helping to ensure that there is <strong>clean water</strong> available when most needed.</p><p>The idea behind <strong>Our Home Space</strong> is to leverage products for social change. Instead of just asking people to contribute with money for a humanitarian cause, we offer products in return. It's called selling (I believe you have heard about it before). We use sales as a means to stimulate social change by selling things people buy regardless of whether we sell them or not. But by buying it from us, the consumer makes a conscious decision. <strong>Conscious Consumption. </strong>And to show you how that works we offer perks that match the value of your contribution in this campaign.</p><p>And of course, we don't just offer any products, but products that are made by brilliant people who have ensured that their production process is not only non-detrimental to our world or the people making them, but that the production and distribution helps workers to better living conditions. We also offer products that are made by communities that have no access to the international market, or any other market for that matter. We also offer products from small scale artisans who either manufacture themselves or work closely with the people making their goods, ensuring that the pay is fair. And by allowing us to sell their products from our platform they are helping our cause.</p><p>The goal is to offer ecological and ethically produced products that are part of everyday life. We are starting this campaign with clothes and jewelry but will eventually have a wider selection of products.</p><p>What this means for you, our ally* is that you can rest assured that anything you buy on Our Home Space will benefit people in more than one step of the way from design, production and sales.</p><p>To make it easier for our allies to be well informed when buying from us you will see what level of social, ethical and ecological consideration the product takes in its creation process and thus you can be better informed in your decision.</p><p><i>*Ally – Term that we use for our customers, because based on their/your decision to consume consciously we simply cannot use the old wear and tear term ‘consumer’.</i></p><p><i><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/products-for-clean-water-our-home-space-clothing/x/15369086#/#top"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">back to top</a></i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479923995/iqkbe0uxh437ujjksbam.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h2><a name=""2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">3. Our first crowdfunding project - PRODUCTS FOR CLEAN WATER</a></h2><p>The first project that we are working on at the moment, this very project that you are reading about here on Indiegogo, is a clean water project in the Brazilian part of the Amazon, on the border of Peru where the <a href=""http://wuante.com/hunikuin/whoweare.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Huni Kuin people</a> live.</p><p>Currently many of the young and old die each rainy season due to drinking and washing themselves with contaminated water. The contamination occurs due to heavy rainfall that stirs up all sorts of debris, feces, dead animals etc. from the ground of the forest and washes it down into the rivers which are the main and only source of water for the tribes living there.</p><p>We aim to bring at least 40 Lifestraw Family units with us to distribute to families with young children who are in risk of getting sick and dying. One lifestraw family unit can provide a family with 18 000 liters (7 755 gallons) of clean potable water.

As you can see, even here there is an extra benefit baked into your backing, not only do the children in the Amazon get clean water, children in Africa will enjoy the same benefit!)</small></i></p><p>An extension of the first goal with this water project, as mentioned above, is to find many ways to make sure that the tribe has access to clean potable water now and in the future.</p><p>In addition to the tasks outlined in the <a href=""https://ourhomespace.myshopify.com/blogs/news/permaculture-initiative"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">permaculture project</a> we will also work with making activated carbon for filters that can be made on site. Experiments with this was started last year and we believe it can be made with lime peel for carbon and lime juice (yes, sounds weird but it works) as the active corrosive ingredient. The reason for using lime is because they grow it around the villages. Activated carbon that has been used in filters can later be mixed with earth and food waste to create <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_preta"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">terra preta</a>, the most fertile soil to be found. Terra Preta is a possible offshoot benefit of the activated carbon part of the project, as the soil which the tribes use to grow their crops on is poor on nutrients and does not yield for long stretches of time, making the locals have to clear new areas of land with fire for growing crops, a process that releases CO2 into the atmosphere. And we want to keep the trees in the Amazon because of the obvious C02 effect, if for nothing else, as trees transform C02 to oxygen. And creating terra preta actually helps to bind C02 from the atmosphere into the ground. Making terra preta was common practice in the pre-Colombian civilizations of the Amazon and was key to being able to sustain larger communities in the Amazonian jungle.</p><p>To start the project we will however as stated above, first make sure that we are able to help from day one that we arrive there by buying and bringing award winning <a href=""http://lifestraw.com/products/lifestraw-family/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Life Straw Family units</a> that can give families with children 18 000 liters of potable water per unit (price €105 per unit). LifeStraw removes virtually all bacteria (99.9999 percent), protozoan parasites (99.99 percent) and viruses (99.999 percent) that can contaminate water. We aim at bringing at least 40 Lifestraws Family units with us. If the funding exceeds our goal then all the better. We will be able to bring more units and have cash with us to sponsor projects that seem to be going in the right direction.</p><p>We are starting this campaign as a means to collect enough funds for us to be able to go to the Amazon to give this much needed aid and then to start the project of making rainwater harvest and purification units together with the locals in Altamira. Once we have positive test results from our water samples we will be inviting people from other villages to come and learn how to replicate the model. </p><p>The long term goal with the water project is to find many suitable ways to purify water on site, with local materials. This way we can turn it into a part of the culture, to harvest water and make wells instead of relying on the polluted rivers as the only source of water.</p><p>If we are able to secure enough funds to secure clean water with this campaign we will go ahead with our next step which aims at eliminating the use of diesel for electricity. And in the long run, eliminate the need for diesel powered motors for their boats, powering them with stored solar energy.</p><p>Fossil fuels is a trap for these people as it is a cost to transport diesel along the rivers using diesel. And so because of their very limited income, sometimes they are stranded in one place, waiting for someone to earn money so that they can buy fuel. </p><p>At the moment it is simply not possible for them to save any money at all to buy solar cells/photovoltaic cells, and batteries. That will be the second phase for Our Home Space. Diverting our income towards the placement of solar panels and batteries in the villages. So that they can save their earnings and perhaps buy more solar panels for other villages.</p><p> </p><p>After having secured energy through renewable sources we will buy computers, cameras and sound equipment for the school and create a controlled (something with walls) environment where there is both energy and clean water and where those who are sick can get treated without having to be out in the open, not having to worry about poisonous animals and insects. Adjacent to this building we will have another controlled environment, a plant school, so that they can grow crops that normally wouldn’t make it past the sprouting stage outside because of insects and other animals. This stage is to ensure that they have access to food all year round and don’t have to buy this from the outside.</p><p>If the model we are thinking of for the above mentioned phases work out, we will be able to be part of a movement that can eliminate the use of fossil fuels in the Amazon and allows the tribes to once again be self-sufficient yet connected to the world. Yes, it sounds ambitious, but it can done. But only if someone starts. And luckily, there is a few of us on the ground. And now we are reaching out to You to become our allies.</p><p>But first, we want to do what we can to prevent deaths among the young population of the Huni Kuin during this and the three coming rainy seasons.</p><p><i><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/products-for-clean-water-our-home-space-clothing/x/15369086#/#top"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">back to top</a></i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479924662/qaecne5ypy9rkvogww2t.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h2><a name=""4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">4.

What We Need to make this a reality</a></h2><p>Here are some more numbers for you to see how your shopping can actually help someone. </p><p>The campaign is set to flexible funding. This means that even if we don't reach the funding goal we will be able to use what we were able to raise towards implementing our vision. If we miss the goal we will <strong>not</strong> compromise on the perks that we will send out to our backers but instead we will look at how we can still deliver what we will afford. Regardless of the amount of funds raised <strong>70-75% </strong>of the profit <strong>will</strong> go towards delivering water purification to the Huni Kuin. It is too important to risk not doing just because we might not reach all the way. So since there is a will there is a way. </p><p> </p><p>We set our goal at <strong>€26,000.  </strong>If we use this as en example for how much funds we will be able to raise then the budget for this project will be as follows: </p><p> </p><p><strong>€12,220</strong> is what it costs for us to buy, pay customs and deliver all the products that we will send to you as tokens of our gratitude. </p><p><i>The rest, what comes below is what normally goes as 'profit' when doing the numbers for a regular business, but this is where we show how will spend the money differently than as a regular shop would.</i></p><p> </p><p><strong>€2,970</strong> goes to buying LifeStraw Family units. That gives 40 units each capable of purifying 18,000 liters of water. That is 720,000 Liters of purified water. Enough to get 40 families through this and the coming 3 rainy seasons. But remember. What we are really hoping to accomplish here is to create on site water purification with locally sourced materials that can not only be taught, but also replicated and taught to other villages and tribes. This would ensure clean water for a lot longer than those 40 units can. This alongside with the permaculture initiative will help alleviate living conditions in the area immensely.</p><p>We will however try to get LifeStraw units cheaper in order to maximise efforts. This might be achieved by selling Lifestraw units on our webpage. Discussions about acting as a retailer of their products have started.</p><p><strong>€3,826</strong> goes to equipment and sponsoring the permaculture project in the village. More detailed budget found under <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/products-for-clean-water-our-home-space-clothing/x/15369086#/#5.1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">section 5.1.</a></p><p><strong>€3,300</strong> of the total profit goes to travel and transport for Artur, Pia and the Lifestraw units. After all, if we can't go there then we can't deliver the items. They live as far into the Amazon as you can imagine.</p><p><strong>€2,600 </strong>10% of what we are able to raise covers fees for Indiegogo and Paypal.</p><p><strong>€1,084</strong> is profit. It is for us to cover expenses whilst there in the jungle and to compensate for any loss of income that we would have had if we were not working with this project. It is for us to be able to eat, sleep (in a home) and get about. And it is for building our website and operations.</p><p>That's<strong> 7,87%</strong> of the earnings for us. That is a bad business idea if the idea is to become wealthy. But that is not the idea here, so don't worry. The idea is to be able to help. </p><p>The benchmark number for any charity is to spend less than <strong>33.3%</strong> of their total income on anything else than the charitable cause. Well we are pretty proud to say that we are within those limits. However we are not a charity (who knows what we will be in the future) but we are a socially conscious company that uses a pattern that already exists, that almost everyone does (buying goods), and use the profit to fund projects we find worth wile.</p><p> </p><p>If we are able to fund the entire project, and get even more funds. Then <strong>20%</strong> of that extra income will go towards buying more LifeStraw family units.</p><p>And another <strong>40%</strong> will go to supporting and initiating other projects in the village. Like the <a href=""https://ourhomespace.myshopify.com/blogs/news/permaculture-initiative"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Permaculture initiative</a>. We will find a way to get better equipment so that we can make sure that the permaculture project can be implemented faster and perhaps in more places.</p><p>The remaining <strong>40% </strong>will have to go to upscale our operations to be able to handle the new size of the project. <strong>Half </strong>of the extra income of these 40% will go towards paying hours to consultants or hiring in-house staff. <strong>20% </strong>will go to office costs, services etc. and <strong>30%</strong> will go to research and development, looking at ways to best fulfil the goals of the organization.</p><p><i><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/products-for-clean-water-our-home-space-clothing/x/15369086#/#top"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">back to top</a></i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479924662/qaecne5ypy9rkvogww2t.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3><i><a name=""5.1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">5.1.</a> Permaculture</i></h3><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>""<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Permaculture</a> is a system of agricultural and social design principles centered on simulating or directly utilizing the patterns and features observed in natural ecosystems. </i></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>It has many branches that include but are not limited to ecological design, ecological engineering, environmental design, construction and integrated water resources management that develops sustainable architecture, and regenerative and self-maintained habitat and agricultural systems modeled from natural ecosystems.""</i></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1529/1153/files/insidedome_03_large.jpg?v=1480096607"" src="""" style=""display: block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i><small>Concept image by Artur Moustafa - Our Home Space.</small></i></p><p>Since it is within our vision and mission to sponsor initiatives and projects that have the same aim as us at Our Home Space, we have partnered with a permaculture initiative that share many goals with us.</p><p>Thus we will be able to achieve our goals by helping with the funding of ongoing initiatives.

<p> </p>
</div><p>In October 2014 I, Artur, fell ill with Meningitis and in my search of getting better, after having been met by nonchalance from my doctors, I met someone through a friend. My friend was travelling with a shaman from the Amazon by the name of Ixa. Ixa told me he could help me get well and invited me to come to his village in the Amazon. Having spent three days with him I was not doubting that he could indeed live up to what he had said and so a few months later I found myself on the way to his village.</p><p>I spent quite some time there, carrying with me my lifestraw to allow me to drink water from the river. I mean this is as deep in the jungle as you can get so there is no infrastructure there to speak of. The rivers are the roads and also the only source of water for these people. Ixa showed me the vast treasures of plant medicines that he has learnt about since he was three years old and with time something miraculous happened. About one year after I had first fallen ill I had my first pain free day.</p><p>Not only was I free of pain. I had regained the physical and mental strength I once had taken for granted.</p><p>So here I was. Witnessing the lives of the Huni Kuin tribe from within, hearing Ixa and the other villagers telling me about their lives there.And since the rainy season was approaching, I was informed that 9 children in this village alone had died during the past rainy season. I had my lifestraw, but what did they have? The rivers?</p><p>Well during the rainy season the entire forest is completely washed over with rain for days on end, bringing with it all sorts of debris, feces, dead animals, bacteria and parasites into the rivers.</p><p>Ixa told me that one reason for having opened up their lands for visitors, participating in their festival and taking part of their culture and knowledge was because they needed help and were inviting us to come up with ideas to help them. I started thinking about how I could help them realize their goals.</p><p>I reasoned that it would be better to harvest rainwater before it got in contact with the rivers and so back to my normal self I started designing a rainwater harvesting module that I saw could be done with local materials and implemented on every house.</p><p>Working conditions were not optimal so I decided to make a workbench to quicken my work as my time there was running out. I promised myself that I would be back to complete my project.</p><p>That of finding a suitable way to purify water on site with local materials. Something that they themselves could make and integrate into their culture to prevent the deaths of their young and old.</p><p> </p><p>The Huni Kuin, as are many inhabitants of the Amazon, are carriers of ancient knowledge that only recently has started to make its entry into western society but with major impact on our quality of life with about<strong> 25% of our medicines having their origins in the rainforest</strong>.</p><p>At the same time western society and its needs account for <strong>rainforest destruction</strong> to such a magnitude that it <strong>kills about 137 plant, animal and insect species every day.</strong></p><p>Most shamans, those who carry the accumulated wisdom of thousands of years of predecessors are over 70 years old and don’t have apprentices. This means that their vast knowledge is slipping out of human consciousness as their way of life gives way to western values, which in the end values the amazon based on timber and mining prices.</p><p>Before the rainforests covered 14% of the world’s surface it is now down to less than 6%. A trend which simply isn’t sustainable in a world with rising CO2 levels.</p><p> </p><p>Today the people of this village go to the nearest village with riverboats run by diesel motors where they besides food, buy more diesel to power generators in their own villages.</p><p>This means that the little income they have from selling arts and crafts go to waste on fossil fuels further polluting the lungs of the world, not because they want to, but because they are trapped in a system created by others.</p><p>What struck me when I was there was that all of this is unnecessary. They could easily have everything they need to be self-sufficient with some minor help from the outside. Since they can be considered as living outside the global economic system there is no way for them to buy equipment to make solar powered water wells, solar panels, batteries or anything else needed to become self-sufficient by themselves in enough quantities unless something is changed.</p><p>And we can do that with them.</p><p>If their money didn’t have to go to fuel and food grown with pesticides in remote places they would be able to direct that money to a nearby community so that they too would be able to become self-reliant.</p><p>If they were allowed to reach out to a greater audience with their knowledge, story and craft they would be able to make a living.</p><p>So in the forest, I did not only think of what I could do, but what other people like me could contribute to in order to make sure that the world will be able to take part of the vast knowledge of the forest. </p><p>At the moment they are looking for better living conditions. And they are looking at what is close at hand. Whilst in our part of the world we are looking beyond what we have today. There are countless initiatives on making self-sustaining communities in the developed world so there is no doubt that this will be achieved sooner or later.</p><p>And here it is possible because we operate within the global market. We can afford it. There will be business that find a way to give you free energy because it means that they can place energy producing units on your house and sell the surplus back to the grid. Out there, there is no grid and so there is no money to be made in the same business model.</p><p>We see many benefits with helping them with their tasks. For starters, losing their way of life will simply be too much of a loss for the world. And so we are looking at non-orthodox economic models to make sure that they can benefit from existing solutions in the world so that the world in turn can gain benefit from their knowledge and a healthy Amazonas for times to come. We are after all one humanity sharing this one world.</p><p><i><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/products-for-clean-water-our-home-space-clothing/x/15369086#/#top"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">back to top</a></i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479924040/pal1vqc8ub5o8qrvqanz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h2><a name=""8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">8.

Even if my communication and teaching/learning skills are poor, they will still have access to 540,000 liters of purified water!</p><p>Other than that I(Artur) once started and ran a furniture company called <a href=""https://www.google.no/search?q=vujj&amp;rlz=2C1VASU_enSE0537SE0541&amp;oq=vujj&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.758j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">VUJJ</a>. We were awarded and nominated for a few prices, mainly for us putting focus on sustainable and durable production with storytelling. Something that was new in the furniture industry in 2006 when we first started. But then I realized what it really meant for me that there were more chairs in the world than people and so I went on to greener pastures thinking there must be a better cause for me to apply my creativity to.

Just a bit further below is a list of perks that we offer to backers. Or simply put, items you can give as gifts! You can also find them on the right side of this page if you are viewing through a browser.We will, with Your help, be able to buy and bring water LifeStraw family purification units to the Huni Kuin people of the Amazon to prevent deaths of their young.We have, by invitation of the Huni Kuin, started to develop strategies for improving their living conditions. Here is a description of what we will do besides giving them immidiate relief by supplying water filters.The idea is pretty basic, we sell products (and at really good prices too) and use the majority of our profit for humanitarian causes. This way, if you don't have money to donate, you can simply continue consuming goods like you probably would anyway if you are likely to buy a pair of trousers, a T-shirt, a dress or jewelry the coming 6 months, or a christmas gift for someone, and still be able to help us achieve our aim of saving lives by you making a conscious decision when shopping.No matter if we are able to fund the entire amount that we set as a goal, we will make sure that about 70-75% of our profit goes to water purification units and that you get the products you choose plus a Christmas card that you can give to the person you have bought it for (even if it is for yourself)!Directly below you will find a presentation highlighting the most important aspects of our campaign.

So that you can either send that via mail or print it out and give it to the person you have in mind for your gift.Now isn't that for good value for your money? You are able to give life by making an active choice in shopping, and the most important thing, we would like to add, is that we will be able to fund this project and you will help save the lives of several young children. And that my friends, is worth way more than the contents of any of the perks. That's a gift for life, literary.So may we recommend that you give this as a Christmas gift to someone you love this season (Yes, it is ok to give it to yourself, its good if you love yourself too). It feels good to help, so we are helping you to feel good about helping us help the Huni Kuin. Note: Taxes and custom fees might be charged by your local carrier or post office when you pick up your perks. back to top1.1. All is one ClothingWith this crowdfunding campaign we are not only launching our new venture Our Home Space but also our own brand, All is One, as part of our strategy to secure funds for the achievement of our goals.All is One focuses on basic wear, things that we generally use a bit more often which leads to more stress on the environment than other products that aren't produced in the same quantity world wide. If we can catch part of the global production of these items, making it fair trade, organic and in an environmentally friendly process, we would be proud. Plus, we would be able to direct the funds towards achieving our vision.All products are Fair wear and all products are organic cotton, except for our trousers which are Fair wear only at the moment.However if we reach 300 pairs of trousers selected as perks, then we will be able to make it fair trade and organic! Sweet right?So if you want the trousers in organic cotton, be sure to share our campaign and let people know that if we reach high enough quantities on them they will be organic.But dont forget, they are Fair wear at the moment, and that means that they are produced under ethical circumstances with fair wages to the workers in non-toxic environments and with no polluted water going out untreated from the factories. Now that's not bad.No logos are visible when worn. Because making a fashion statement isn’t necessarily about what you see on the outside.All is One - Men's V-neck T-shirtFinal products might differ slightly from images.€34 Men's T-shirt - Organic and Fair wear / fair tradeV-neck T-shirt in soft organic cotton.

Huni Kuin CraftsThese perks are made by the Huni Kuin tribe. By choosing items in this category you help them to an income and support fair pay for work done in the villages helping us achieve the goal of positive social change.Since there are so many different types of patterns, and because it is all handmade, what you get is actually a coupon for the perk you selected.This way you can browse through all the products in the category on our page after we recieve the goods and choose the right one for You. This ensures you get the version you want and that money goes directly to the tribe, plus they get clean water.€44 Bracelet€88 2 bracelets, matching pair€40 Small Huni Kuin Bag€50 Huni Kuin NecklaceAll Huni Kuin jewelry and bags are made by women of the tribe and are the result of a project of valuing the traditional knowledge of indigenous women of the Huni Kuin people. The project enables the meeting of more than 50 women in order to promote the exchange of knowledge among the oldest and most qualified artisans with the future generations of women of the 32 villages of the indigenous land that they inhabit, located in the Amazon forest.In addition to empowering indigenous women, the project aims to promote greater distribution of income acquired through the sale of ethnic art of this people, since in most cases only the families of the leaderships that travel outside the forest end up benefiting.At the moment the project is creating a label to operate and sell from so that not only will you get a piece of original handmade jewelry, you will also get a note from the person who did where that informs of the meaning of the sacred geometry of your specific piece. The project is managed by Deborah Castor, from Rio de Janeiro, and funded by donations.back to top  We have also chosen to collaborate with some brilliant initiatives on the market for some of the perks so that everyone will be able to find something they want. These perks come from brands that make a difference. These will not be issued as discount coupons as in the case with the Huni Kuin crafts but will be sent to you directly just like you ordered it.back to top1.3.

EYESEEi  EYESEEi was founded by Swedish fashion designer Sanna Aulén in 2013. Before she created EYESEEi, Sanna studied and worked with clothing in the global fashion industry, longing to create items that she could connect with in a more sustainable and meaningful way to underline the slow fashion movement she wanted to be part of.  Sanna works with transparent production, and in Bali she works directly with a few select silver smiths. All items are handmade in natural materials by local silversmiths making these items in the comfort of their own village and home, always with fair trading in mind and a personal contact directly with the maker. EYESEEi works partly with recycled silver, and with silver from unsold jewelry through a company that recreates Sterling silver purchased from other local artisans. Silver  can be transformed and reused countless times.Link to EYESEEi's webpage. Triangle pin earring€40Unique crystal pin earring with one handpicked, rough cut clear quart set in sterling silver with Italian chain.To provide a unique and special look all of our jewelry are handmade and our stones are rough cut or kept raw.

2. Our Home Space- a platform for conscious consumptionThe web portal Our Home Space is being set up with this campaign. The goal of the page is to enable us to initiate and/or sponsor community projects that empower locals to improve their lives in parts of the world where we see how we easily, with the help of our allies* can make a positive change in the life of a community.One such easy way is helping to ensure that there is clean water available when most needed.The idea behind Our Home Space is to leverage products for social change. Instead of just asking people to contribute with money for a humanitarian cause, we offer products in return. It's called selling (I believe you have heard about it before). We use sales as a means to stimulate social change by selling things people buy regardless of whether we sell them or not. But by buying it from us, the consumer makes a conscious decision. Conscious Consumption. And to show you how that works we offer perks that match the value of your contribution in this campaign.And of course, we don't just offer any products, but products that are made by brilliant people who have ensured that their production process is not only non-detrimental to our world or the people making them, but that the production and distribution helps workers to better living conditions. We also offer products that are made by communities that have no access to the international market, or any other market for that matter. We also offer products from small scale artisans who either manufacture themselves or work closely with the people making their goods, ensuring that the pay is fair. And by allowing us to sell their products from our platform they are helping our cause.The goal is to offer ecological and ethically produced products that are part of everyday life. We are starting this campaign with clothes and jewelry but will eventually have a wider selection of products.What this means for you, our ally* is that you can rest assured that anything you buy on Our Home Space will benefit people in more than one step of the way from design, production and sales.To make it easier for our allies to be well informed when buying from us you will see what level of social, ethical and ecological consideration the product takes in its creation process and thus you can be better informed in your decision.*Ally – Term that we use for our customers, because based on their/your decision to consume consciously we simply cannot use the old wear and tear term ‘consumer’.back to top3. Our first crowdfunding project - PRODUCTS FOR CLEAN WATERThe first project that we are working on at the moment, this very project that you are reading about here on Indiegogo, is a clean water project in the Brazilian part of the Amazon, on the border of Peru where the Huni Kuin people live.Currently many of the young and old die each rainy season due to drinking and washing themselves with contaminated water. The contamination occurs due to heavy rainfall that stirs up all sorts of debris, feces, dead animals etc. from the ground of the forest and washes it down into the rivers which are the main and only source of water for the tribes living there.We aim to bring at least 40 Lifestraw Family units with us to distribute to families with young children who are in risk of getting sick and dying. One lifestraw family unit can provide a family with 18 000 liters (7 755 gallons) of clean potable water. That is 3 years of water consumption for a family of 5. A second aim is to purify water on site, with locally sourced materials so that they won't be dependent on outsiders buying and bringing filters or purification modules.Also, we will be looking at implementing new ways of making toilets in a way so that they do not overflow and contaminate the rivers during rainy season.This will be achieved through a permaculture initiative that you can read more about by clicking this link.Concept image by Artur Moustafa - Our Home Space.back to top3.1 Aim of the projectThe first aim of the project is to make sure that the people of the tribe have access to clean water to prevent deaths amongst its young population as soon as possible. That’s why the project time is set to 19 days. So that we will have time to go there with LifeStraws in the beginning of the rainy season. The campaign ends on Christmas eve and our hope is that by then we will have good news for the people of the village.(Image from the company behind LifeStraw. As you can see, even here there is an extra benefit baked into your backing, not only do the children in the Amazon get clean water, children in Africa will enjoy the same benefit!)An extension of the first goal with this water project, as mentioned above, is to find many ways to make sure that the tribe has access to clean potable water now and in the future.In addition to the tasks outlined in the permaculture project we will also work with making activated carbon for filters that can be made on site. Experiments with this was started last year and we believe it can be made with lime peel for carbon and lime juice (yes, sounds weird but it works) as the active corrosive ingredient. The reason for using lime is because they grow it around the villages. Activated carbon that has been used in filters can later be mixed with earth and food waste to create terra preta, the most fertile soil to be found. Terra Preta is a possible offshoot benefit of the activated carbon part of the project, as the soil which the tribes use to grow their crops on is poor on nutrients and does not yield for long stretches of time, making the locals have to clear new areas of land with fire for growing crops, a process that releases CO2 into the atmosphere. And we want to keep the trees in the Amazon because of the obvious C02 effect, if for nothing else, as trees transform C02 to oxygen. And creating terra preta actually helps to bind C02 from the atmosphere into the ground. Making terra preta was common practice in the pre-Colombian civilizations of the Amazon and was key to being able to sustain larger communities in the Amazonian jungle.To start the project we will however as stated above, first make sure that we are able to help from day one that we arrive there by buying and bringing award winning Life Straw Family units that can give families with children 18 000 liters of potable water per unit (price €105 per unit). LifeStraw removes virtually all bacteria (99.9999 percent), protozoan parasites (99.99 percent) and viruses (99.999 percent) that can contaminate water. We aim at bringing at least 40 Lifestraws Family units with us. If the funding exceeds our goal then all the better. We will be able to bring more units and have cash with us to sponsor projects that seem to be going in the right direction.We are starting this campaign as a means to collect enough funds for us to be able to go to the Amazon to give this much needed aid and then to start the project of making rainwater harvest and purification units together with the locals in Altamira. Once we have positive test results from our water samples we will be inviting people from other villages to come and learn how to replicate the model. The long term goal with the water project is to find many suitable ways to purify water on site, with local materials. This way we can turn it into a part of the culture, to harvest water and make wells instead of relying on the polluted rivers as the only source of water.If we are able to secure enough funds to secure clean water with this campaign we will go ahead with our next step which aims at eliminating the use of diesel for electricity. And in the long run, eliminate the need for diesel powered motors for their boats, powering them with stored solar energy.Fossil fuels is a trap for these people as it is a cost to transport diesel along the rivers using diesel. And so because of their very limited income, sometimes they are stranded in one place, waiting for someone to earn money so that they can buy fuel. At the moment it is simply not possible for them to save any money at all to buy solar cells/photovoltaic cells, and batteries. That will be the second phase for Our Home Space. Diverting our income towards the placement of solar panels and batteries in the villages. So that they can save their earnings and perhaps buy more solar panels for other villages. After having secured energy through renewable sources we will buy computers, cameras and sound equipment for the school and create a controlled (something with walls) environment where there is both energy and clean water and where those who are sick can get treated without having to be out in the open, not having to worry about poisonous animals and insects. Adjacent to this building we will have another controlled environment, a plant school, so that they can grow crops that normally wouldn’t make it past the sprouting stage outside because of insects and other animals. This stage is to ensure that they have access to food all year round and don’t have to buy this from the outside.If the model we are thinking of for the above mentioned phases work out, we will be able to be part of a movement that can eliminate the use of fossil fuels in the Amazon and allows the tribes to once again be self-sufficient yet connected to the world. Yes, it sounds ambitious, but it can done. But only if someone starts. And luckily, there is a few of us on the ground. And now we are reaching out to You to become our allies.But first, we want to do what we can to prevent deaths among the young population of the Huni Kuin during this and the three coming rainy seasons.back to top4. Other Ways You Can HelpDo you like the idea but can't afford our products? Please share it on social networks.You like the idea but not the products? Buy it for a hippie friend of yours, the will love you!Or simply donate. back to top5. What We Need to make this a realityHere are some more numbers for you to see how your shopping can actually help someone. The campaign is set to flexible funding. This means that even if we don't reach the funding goal we will be able to use what we were able to raise towards implementing our vision. If we miss the goal we will not compromise on the perks that we will send out to our backers but instead we will look at how we can still deliver what we will afford. Regardless of the amount of funds raised 70-75% of the profit will go towards delivering water purification to the Huni Kuin. It is too important to risk not doing just because we might not reach all the way. So since there is a will there is a way.  We set our goal at €26,000.  If we use this as en example for how much funds we will be able to raise then the budget for this project will be as follows:  €12,220 is what it costs for us to buy, pay customs and deliver all the products that we will send to you as tokens of our gratitude. The rest, what comes below is what normally goes as 'profit' when doing the numbers for a regular business, but this is where we show how will spend the money differently than as a regular shop would. €2,970 goes to buying LifeStraw Family units. That gives 40 units each capable of purifying 18,000 liters of water. That is 720,000 Liters of purified water. Enough to get 40 families through this and the coming 3 rainy seasons. But remember. What we are really hoping to accomplish here is to create on site water purification with locally sourced materials that can not only be taught, but also replicated and taught to other villages and tribes. This would ensure clean water for a lot longer than those 40 units can. This alongside with the permaculture initiative will help alleviate living conditions in the area immensely.We will however try to get LifeStraw units cheaper in order to maximise efforts. This might be achieved by selling Lifestraw units on our webpage. Discussions about acting as a retailer of their products have started.€3,826 goes to equipment and sponsoring the permaculture project in the village. More detailed budget found under section 5.1.€3,300 of the total profit goes to travel and transport for Artur, Pia and the Lifestraw units. After all, if we can't go there then we can't deliver the items. They live as far into the Amazon as you can imagine.€2,600 10% of what we are able to raise covers fees for Indiegogo and Paypal.€1,084 is profit. It is for us to cover expenses whilst there in the jungle and to compensate for any loss of income that we would have had if we were not working with this project. It is for us to be able to eat, sleep (in a home) and get about. And it is for building our website and operations.That's 7,87% of the earnings for us. That is a bad business idea if the idea is to become wealthy. But that is not the idea here, so don't worry. The idea is to be able to help. The benchmark number for any charity is to spend less than 33.3% of their total income on anything else than the charitable cause. Well we are pretty proud to say that we are within those limits. However we are not a charity (who knows what we will be in the future) but we are a socially conscious company that uses a pattern that already exists, that almost everyone does (buying goods), and use the profit to fund projects we find worth wile. If we are able to fund the entire project, and get even more funds. Then 20% of that extra income will go towards buying more LifeStraw family units.And another 40% will go to supporting and initiating other projects in the village. Like the Permaculture initiative. We will find a way to get better equipment so that we can make sure that the permaculture project can be implemented faster and perhaps in more places.The remaining 40% will have to go to upscale our operations to be able to handle the new size of the project. Half of the extra income of these 40% will go towards paying hours to consultants or hiring in-house staff. 20% will go to office costs, services etc. and 30% will go to research and development, looking at ways to best fulfil the goals of the organization.back to top5.1. Permaculture""Permaculture is a system of agricultural and social design principles centered on simulating or directly utilizing the patterns and features observed in natural ecosystems. It has many branches that include but are not limited to ecological design, ecological engineering, environmental design, construction and integrated water resources management that develops sustainable architecture, and regenerative and self-maintained habitat and agricultural systems modeled from natural ecosystems.""Concept image by Artur Moustafa - Our Home Space.Since it is within our vision and mission to sponsor initiatives and projects that have the same aim as us at Our Home Space, we have partnered with a permaculture initiative that share many goals with us.Thus we will be able to achieve our goals by helping with the funding of ongoing initiatives. Simply put, through collaboration.One such initiative is called PERMACULTURE IN THE VILLAGES. It is currently in need of funding for implementation to be possible. They have however secured funds for salaries and air-plane tickets for 3 out of 4 workers through a yearly festival, the Nixpu Pima festival, where people from outside the forest come and pay a sum to participate with the tribe. This is the very same festival where we will be handing out LifeStraw Family units once our funding goals are achieved.So at the moment we need funds for the fourth worker as well as funds for tools and material for implementation to be possible. Thus we have budgeted €3.850 of our raised funds for tools and materials to complete this project.If we go beyond our funding goals we will also make sure that the fourth worker can get paid, speeding up the process considerably.Click here for a fuller description of the project by Hilas Mariante Al Khouri (to the left on the image below ), from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. back to top5.2. OpportunitiesWe already have some promising opportunities both when it comes to implementation and expansion.Sponsoring on Photo Voltaic film covered glass panelsWe are currently in discussions with a large supplier of glass for photo voltaic cells on the possibillity of sponsorship by displaying their name and making their products available and known through our implementation phase. The more views we get on the videos we post during implementation, the more likeley we are to get a full sponsorship on this. Expanding to other biotopesWe are in discussions with a Tibetan Buddhist monastery in southern India who are interested in making a transition into self-sustanence so that they can work as a hub for the tibetan community in the region.  back to top6. What is Our Home Space?Our Home Space, is as mentioned above, a platform for conscious consumption with the aim of helping to establish at least one self-sustaining village in the Amazon. Here are our vision and mission statements alongside our business idea.(Concept image depicting Voltaic film covered glass panels on a geodesic dome for a plant school that provides energy and harvests rainwater. Concept image by Artur Moustafa - Our Home Space.)6.1 VisionWe see a possible future where many initiatives and ways of self-sustenance co-exist and learn from each other. We believe that a possible way towards this can be found in using our current system (while it exists) to finance and develop this. So that regardless of whether our outside world stands or not, these places will. And they can have everything they need regardless of our rise or fall. Our vision is to help make sure these places exist in all biotopes.The vision of Our Home Space is that by turning one village in the middle of the Amazon into a self-sustainable village that meets the needs of all of its inhabitants we can find ways to make sure that the model can spread to other villages surrounding it ushering a system with nodes that support each other but that can function by themselves.Once we have found a model that works for the tropical jungle, we will look at other biotopes and how we can achieve self-sufficiency together with the people who live there.e at Our Home Space know that the technology to achieve this exists today. Our vision is that we will aid in finding economic solutions that allows for the distribution of the right solution to the right place so that we all can enjoy our home space. 6.2 MissionThe mission of Our Home Space is to, with the help of our allies*, aid with the development of at least one self-sustaining community that can be said to be outside the global economy.Our mission is to make it in such a way that the model is replicable.We will be working towards ensuring that the following criteria is met in every area where we involve ourselves.
Access to clean potable water
Access to renewable energy
Self-sufficiency in food
A place for learning with access to global communications
A place to be able to produce and sell goods to the global and local market
Our Home Space will share all functional findings and strategies openly, as instruction videos, documentation through text and image, classes and workshops and by offering access to all tools used and developed.6.3 BUSINESS IDEAOur business idea is to supply customers with ethically and ecologically produced goods that we know people consume anyway (because of the set-up of the world economic system), such as, but not limited to, t-shirts, underwear, trousers and socks etc. at competitive prices. We will be retailing both our own brands and those of others who we see fit with the model of Our Home Space.And for us to be able to reach out to as many allies as possible we have tailored our own brand, All is One, to be modest in style, color and prints. Because making a fashion statement isn’t necessarily about what you see on the outside.back to top7. Background
 

 
In October 2014 I, Artur, fell ill with Meningitis and in my search of getting better, after having been met by nonchalance from my doctors, I met someone through a friend. My friend was travelling with a shaman from the Amazon by the name of Ixa. Ixa told me he could help me get well and invited me to come to his village in the Amazon. Having spent three days with him I was not doubting that he could indeed live up to what he had said and so a few months later I found myself on the way to his village.I spent quite some time there, carrying with me my lifestraw to allow me to drink water from the river. I mean this is as deep in the jungle as you can get so there is no infrastructure there to speak of. The rivers are the roads and also the only source of water for these people. Ixa showed me the vast treasures of plant medicines that he has learnt about since he was three years old and with time something miraculous happened. About one year after I had first fallen ill I had my first pain free day.Not only was I free of pain. I had regained the physical and mental strength I once had taken for granted.So here I was. Witnessing the lives of the Huni Kuin tribe from within, hearing Ixa and the other villagers telling me about their lives there.And since the rainy season was approaching, I was informed that 9 children in this village alone had died during the past rainy season. I had my lifestraw, but what did they have? The rivers?Well during the rainy season the entire forest is completely washed over with rain for days on end, bringing with it all sorts of debris, feces, dead animals, bacteria and parasites into the rivers.Ixa told me that one reason for having opened up their lands for visitors, participating in their festival and taking part of their culture and knowledge was because they needed help and were inviting us to come up with ideas to help them. I started thinking about how I could help them realize their goals.I reasoned that it would be better to harvest rainwater before it got in contact with the rivers and so back to my normal self I started designing a rainwater harvesting module that I saw could be done with local materials and implemented on every house.Working conditions were not optimal so I decided to make a workbench to quicken my work as my time there was running out. I promised myself that I would be back to complete my project.That of finding a suitable way to purify water on site with local materials. Something that they themselves could make and integrate into their culture to prevent the deaths of their young and old. The Huni Kuin, as are many inhabitants of the Amazon, are carriers of ancient knowledge that only recently has started to make its entry into western society but with major impact on our quality of life with about 25% of our medicines having their origins in the rainforest.At the same time western society and its needs account for rainforest destruction to such a magnitude that it kills about 137 plant, animal and insect species every day.Most shamans, those who carry the accumulated wisdom of thousands of years of predecessors are over 70 years old and don’t have apprentices. This means that their vast knowledge is slipping out of human consciousness as their way of life gives way to western values, which in the end values the amazon based on timber and mining prices.Before the rainforests covered 14% of the world’s surface it is now down to less than 6%. A trend which simply isn’t sustainable in a world with rising CO2 levels. Today the people of this village go to the nearest village with riverboats run by diesel motors where they besides food, buy more diesel to power generators in their own villages.This means that the little income they have from selling arts and crafts go to waste on fossil fuels further polluting the lungs of the world, not because they want to, but because they are trapped in a system created by others.What struck me when I was there was that all of this is unnecessary. They could easily have everything they need to be self-sufficient with some minor help from the outside. Since they can be considered as living outside the global economic system there is no way for them to buy equipment to make solar powered water wells, solar panels, batteries or anything else needed to become self-sufficient by themselves in enough quantities unless something is changed.And we can do that with them.If their money didn’t have to go to fuel and food grown with pesticides in remote places they would be able to direct that money to a nearby community so that they too would be able to become self-reliant.If they were allowed to reach out to a greater audience with their knowledge, story and craft they would be able to make a living.So in the forest, I did not only think of what I could do, but what other people like me could contribute to in order to make sure that the world will be able to take part of the vast knowledge of the forest. At the moment they are looking for better living conditions. And they are looking at what is close at hand. Whilst in our part of the world we are looking beyond what we have today. There are countless initiatives on making self-sustaining communities in the developed world so there is no doubt that this will be achieved sooner or later.And here it is possible because we operate within the global market. We can afford it. There will be business that find a way to give you free energy because it means that they can place energy producing units on your house and sell the surplus back to the grid. Out there, there is no grid and so there is no money to be made in the same business model.We see many benefits with helping them with their tasks. For starters, losing their way of life will simply be too much of a loss for the world. And so we are looking at non-orthodox economic models to make sure that they can benefit from existing solutions in the world so that the world in turn can gain benefit from their knowledge and a healthy Amazonas for times to come. We are after all one humanity sharing this one world.back to top8. So who am I?I mean, you don't just want your goods but you want to know that we will be able to deliver the project promised, right? Well, here is the good thing about bringing LifeStraw units. Even if my communication and teaching/learning skills are poor, they will still have access to 540,000 liters of purified water!Other than that I(Artur) once started and ran a furniture company called VUJJ. We were awarded and nominated for a few prices, mainly for us putting focus on sustainable and durable production with storytelling. Something that was new in the furniture industry in 2006 when we first started. But then I realized what it really meant for me that there were more chairs in the world than people and so I went on to greener pastures thinking there must be a better cause for me to apply my creativity to. Some of those products are still produced today by rvw.se.Image from part of Vujj's showroom in 2007.I then went to London to work for an NGO, CLEAR-Village, working with developing concepts and methods for rapid project planning and implementation within the field of sustainable urban development.I've been a speaker at various sustainability conferences talking from the perspective of an entrepreneur and designer. One such instance was the Sustainability conference '08 in Malmö hosted by the Centre for Sustainable Design, Farnham, UK. Below is a video with thoughts on sustainable design from 2008, expressed by a young and rather camera shy version of me. After that I used those models when I started working as a project manager at the Helsingborg city Theatre, where I worked with theatre as a tool for achieving social cohesion. Something that also lifted the ticket sales of the theatre. When I started the project sales were hanging around 30% and the image of the theatre in the city was dark. Facts I was oblivious to as I started my outreach project. After my four years at the theatre we were up to over 90% in sales and the project had not only won accolade from the main funders, Region Skåne - Kultur and the Swedish Arts Council, but had also received attention from The European commission who used the project as a best practice project for OMC, Open Method of Communication, a way for member countries to share best practice.Here is a video  of recommendation from my former employer at Helsingborg city Theatre. 
 At the end of my time at the theatre, before becoming the theatre manager at a theatre for children, I helped establish the performing arts biennial Bibu in the town of Helsingborg. After that I worked as a theatre manager at Teater Sagohuset. Unfortunately, during my time there I got an inflammation in either my brain or my spine which left me unable to work for more than a year, struggling with constant pain, fatigue, loss of balance, words and many other abilities.

Now I have the chance to be the person who brings your help to people who need it. I have been able to accomplish things before, and the reason for this section to be here is for you to have confidence in me being able to accomplish this project as well, but this time, with Your help.And yes, there is a possibillity that the funding goal won't be reached or that the ambitions of helping to make them a self-reliant thriving community won't be reached with the help of this initiative.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>David and Hillary Chapin have been working on Eagle Pass Camp since 2005, when we first brought the property in Wales, MA. After many years and a lot of hard work, we secured a loan from the SBA and began construction on our campground, set to open in Spring 2017. But we have some expenses not covered by the construction loan: the furniture and incidentals such as paper towels, soap, and various other finishing touches. We want to provide our customers high quality sleeping and storage furniture that's made in the USA and not shipped from overseas. We've identified a supplier in Tennessee who can make what we want for the best price, but we need some help to get there. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need  </h3>
<p>We need to furnish our campsite! All money raised will go to paying for beds, mattresses, tables, and chairs for the camp. The more money we raise, the better quality furniture we can buy -- thicker, nicer mattresses, with nylon coverings rather than vinyl, wooden tables and chairs to put in the cabins.  Any money raised beyond what we need for camp furniture will be used for supplies for the camp: hand soap, paper towels, etc. If we greatly exceed our funding goal, we will be able to cover costs to increase the parking area at the camp. </p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>We're offering a variety of Perks, from small to large, but the biggest reward will be the ability to  touch (and sit and sleep on) your contribution plus the opportunity to see your name displayed as a list of our donors.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The LARP community in New England is incredibly large and diverse, and really needs some space in which it can spread its wings. Eagle Pass Camp will help grow the community by providing campsite space year-round,  making it easier to find a time and a location to run your game. We will also be providing a number of services to make running a LARP easier for everyone, and hopefully lowering the barrier to entry for new, first-time, or smaller games to run. </p>
<p>But to do that we need someplace for everyone to sleep!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Spread the word about this campaign and about Eagle Pass Camp generally! Let your LARP directors know about Eagle Pass. Contact us to schedule a tour! And stay tuned for more information about our progress to camp completion. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>My name is Micheal Finch, I grew up in the Helena community, I also have ridden BMX since I was 10 years old. I am now 30 years old and still riding BMX. We have had a need for an indoor park every since i can remember. I met Larry in 2011 and was instantly drawn to him as a friend, there was a quality about him that you could just tell that he was a good person. Larry helped bridge the gap between the sports that all use the outdoor skatepark in town. There was no beef between the sports after he came around. Tragically Larry passed away from Cancer. Larry created the Helena Skateboard Academy and was teaching kids of all ages to be respectful action sport athletes, and i would like to continue that here in Helena. </li>
<li>This campaign is to raise funds for the materials needed to build an indoor skatepark in the Helena area. There comes a time every year when the snow starts flying, and we all have to put our skateboards, bikes, scooters, and skates away for 6-8 months. It would be amazing if we had a place where we could ride, and skate year round and not have to travel to warmer areas of the country just to have a good time.</li>
<li>In donating you will be helping the Helena Community have something safe for the youth to do, you will be helping these athletes ensure that they can participate in their sports year round. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>I am asking for 7,000 dollars for materials cost for the park. All donations will go directly to the purchase of lumber and iron, and all other materials needed for the features to be built. </li>
<li>There will be different perks depending on your donation. From getting your name placed in the park as a donator, all the way up to discounted memberships to the park.</li>
<li>If we don't reach our full goal we will still use whatever money to get the park under construction. All the perks will still be the same even if we don't obtain our goal. And if we surpass it we will put all money into the facilities.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>My project will be beneficial the the community by providing a safe environment to keep up on their sports, it will help cutdown on the shady stuff that goes down at the outdoor skatepark where there is no monitoring of activities.</li>

<p><strong>One Red Maple Hop Yard</strong></p>
<p><strong>Who:</strong>  Volunteers comprised of active duty military, veterans, police, sheriff, fire, and EMS working in collaboration with and in support of One Red Maple farm.</p>
<p><strong>What</strong>:  “One Red Maple Hop Yard” – a 1.5 acre agricultural start-up effort to grow hops (three variety minimum) in the rural farmland of Virginia Beach, VA.</p>
<p><strong>When:</strong>  Infrastructure installed by the end of February 2017.  Planting of hop rhizomes in the Spring of 2017.</p>
<p><strong>Where</strong>:  On the grounds of One Red Maple farm in the Back Bay area of Virginia Beach, VA.</p>
<p><strong>Why</strong>: </p>
<ol>
<li>To supply emerging and established local craft beer breweries with fresh, east coast, locally grown hops.</li>
<li>To afford the visitors and volunteers of LZ-Grace Warrior Retreat an opportunity to participate in a beneficial activity which produces a viable, perennial, agricultural crop.</li>
<li>100% of all proceeds of One Red Maple Hop Yard will go to financially support the efforts of Landing Zone Grace Warrior Retreat Foundation, a 501c3 nonprofit organization aimed at providing a secure resting place for SOF members, families and Tier One First Responders.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How</strong>:  Through the installation of infrastructure to support a 2,000 crown perennial hop yard on an identified, dedicated 1.5 acre portion of an existing, active, horse boarding farm in the Back Bay area of Virginia Beach, VA.  Infrastructure includes installation of seventy (70) twenty-five foot telephone poles in ten (10) rows on the northernmost portion of the property known as One Red Maple farm.  Infrastructure also includes the installation of ¼ inch stranded steel cable with a 6,640 lb. strength rating continuously across the length of each row at a height of 20 feet above the ground to create a trellis system.  Groundwork infrastructure includes installation of commercial drip irrigation and fertilizer systems.</p>
<p><strong>""One Red Maple Hop Yard”</strong> is our ambitious attempt at establishing hops as a viable, sustainable, agricultural crop in Virginia Beach, Virginia.  With the explosion of the craft beer industry comes the demand for one important ingredient; humulus lupulus aka hops.  The demand for hops can sometimes outweigh the supply.  It is our desire to fulfill the need of local craft breweries by providing them with fresh, locally grown hops of the varieties they desire.</p>
<p>Located on a 38 acre horse farm in the rural Back Bay area of Virginia Beach, <strong>“One Red Maple Hop Yard”</strong> can be found at the end of a Bradford pear tree lined driveway on an initial 1.5 acre site.  Plans for the Hop Yard include infrastructure to accommodate the growth of approximately 2,000 individual perennial hop plants (crowns).  It is our desire to grow the varieties of hops that local brewers need and want.  We also like the idea of keeping a patriotic theme to the varieties of hops we chose to grow. With this in mind, we will grow three varieties of hops as essentials (dual purpose “Chinook” hops, bittering ""CTZ"" (Columbus/ Tomahawk®/ Zeus) hops and bittering “Admiral” hops.)  An area designated for experimental growth will hopefully, one day, grow bittering “Warrior®” hops.  With proven success, the Hop Yard is designed to easily accommodate expansion in the future. </p>
<p>In order for <strong>“One Red Maple Hop Yard”</strong> to get off the ground, both literally and figuratively, your generous financial support will help us purchase the following items:</p>
<ol>
<li>$25,500.00      installation of seventy (70) twenty-five foot length telephone pole trellis system.</li>
<li>$10,000.00      hop rhizomes (2,000 @ $5.00 each).</li>
<li>$  3,500.00      commercial drip irrigation system for 4,000  linear feet.</li>
<li>$  3,000.00      coir twine and anchors (48,000 ft).</li>
<li>$  5,000.00      nutrients/fertilizer.</li>
<li>$  5,000.00      pesticide/fungicide.</li>
<li>$  2,000.00      two (2) Werner 20 ft. Fiberglass Twin Step Ladders with 300 lb. Load Capacity Type IA Model # T7420.</li>
<li>$     500.00      Powermate  18 in. 196cc 4-Cycle Rear-Tine Gas Tiller Model # PRTT196E.</li>
</ol>
<p><u>$54,500.00      Total</u></p>

</div></div>","One Red Maple Hop Yard
Who:  Volunteers comprised of active duty military, veterans, police, sheriff, fire, and EMS working in collaboration with and in support of One Red Maple farm.
What:  “One Red Maple Hop Yard” – a 1.5 acre agricultural start-up effort to grow hops (three variety minimum) in the rural farmland of Virginia Beach, VA.
When:  Infrastructure installed by the end of February 2017.  Planting of hop rhizomes in the Spring of 2017.
Where:  On the grounds of One Red Maple farm in the Back Bay area of Virginia Beach, VA.
Why: 

To supply emerging and established local craft beer breweries with fresh, east coast, locally grown hops.
To afford the visitors and volunteers of LZ-Grace Warrior Retreat an opportunity to participate in a beneficial activity which produces a viable, perennial, agricultural crop.
100% of all proceeds of One Red Maple Hop Yard will go to financially support the efforts of Landing Zone Grace Warrior Retreat Foundation, a 501c3 nonprofit organization aimed at providing a secure resting place for SOF members, families and Tier One First Responders.

How:  Through the installation of infrastructure to support a 2,000 crown perennial hop yard on an identified, dedicated 1.5 acre portion of an existing, active, horse boarding farm in the Back Bay area of Virginia Beach, VA.  Infrastructure includes installation of seventy (70) twenty-five foot telephone poles in ten (10) rows on the northernmost portion of the property known as One Red Maple farm.  Infrastructure also includes the installation of ¼ inch stranded steel cable with a 6,640 lb. strength rating continuously across the length of each row at a height of 20 feet above the ground to create a trellis system.  Groundwork infrastructure includes installation of commercial drip irrigation and fertilizer systems.
""One Red Maple Hop Yard” is our ambitious attempt at establishing hops as a viable, sustainable, agricultural crop in Virginia Beach, Virginia.  With the explosion of the craft beer industry comes the demand for one important ingredient; humulus lupulus aka hops.  The demand for hops can sometimes outweigh the supply.  It is our desire to fulfill the need of local craft breweries by providing them with fresh, locally grown hops of the varieties they desire.
Located on a 38 acre horse farm in the rural Back Bay area of Virginia Beach, “One Red Maple Hop Yard” can be found at the end of a Bradford pear tree lined driveway on an initial 1.5 acre site.  Plans for the Hop Yard include infrastructure to accommodate the growth of approximately 2,000 individual perennial hop plants (crowns).  It is our desire to grow the varieties of hops that local brewers need and want.  We also like the idea of keeping a patriotic theme to the varieties of hops we chose to grow. With this in mind, we will grow three varieties of hops as essentials (dual purpose “Chinook” hops, bittering ""CTZ"" (Columbus/ Tomahawk®/ Zeus) hops and bittering “Admiral” hops.)  An area designated for experimental growth will hopefully, one day, grow bittering “Warrior®” hops.  With proven success, the Hop Yard is designed to easily accommodate expansion in the future. 
In order for “One Red Maple Hop Yard” to get off the ground, both literally and figuratively, your generous financial support will help us purchase the following items:

$25,500.00      installation of seventy (70) twenty-five foot length telephone pole trellis system.
$10,000.00      hop rhizomes (2,000 @ $5.00 each).
$  3,500.00      commercial drip irrigation system for 4,000  linear feet.
$  3,000.00      coir twine and anchors (48,000 ft).
$  5,000.00      nutrients/fertilizer.
$  5,000.00      pesticide/fungicide.
$  2,000.00      two (2) Werner 20 ft. Fiberglass Twin Step Ladders with 300 lb. Load Capacity Type IA Model # T7420.
$     500.00      Powermate  18 in. 196cc 4-Cycle Rear-Tine Gas Tiller Model # PRTT196E.

<p>The need is GREAT!<br/> Trinity Life Solutions was created to provide premier mental health treatment to low income families. After many years of working in the industry Trinity's founder, Alesia Glass-Rhodes recognized that low income families often received sub par treatment with little hope to have a life better. Alesia sought out to find the best professionals in the area to create a place of hope, faith and support for families battling mental illness.  </p>
<p>TLS is a small family focus mental health practice that provides counseling, support coordination and ABA therapy. At the current time we have a long waiting list due to the location and availability of staff. Your contribution will allow us to relocated to a fully renovated space and hire additional staff to meet our community's needs. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>$26,000 is needed to complete this full project. (50% of project funds will be from matching corporate funds.) </p>
<p><strong>This Project includes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The relocation and build out of the new ABA therapy clinic. The currently clinic only can serve a very small number of  children during a set time period. Our new clinic will allow for us to triple the number of children and families to be served </li>
<li>Training curriculum for additional staff.  We look to hire additional behavior therapist to work in the ABA clinic. We want to ensure our client's parents that all of our staff have received the same superb training, creating consistency between therapist for their child. </li>
<li>Establishment of new website and marketing materials to eligible families. Our founder is a mental health/social service professional and created basics to start the business off.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution goes beyond this project. It will create impact for years to come with in the mental health industry.

<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>My name is Katherine and I own and operate the circus academy of Tucson. Everyday I work to keep our space and program going to provide circus education and a community space to our city. Our program is more than just circus, we want to be part of our student's over all educational life in becoming prepared adults and responsible community members. This includes offering community service opportunities and lessons on setting and completing goals, working as part of a team and exploring the self to develop awareness  and progress as human beings. Everyday, our students lives are impacted by our programming.</p>
<p> Our goal is to offer circus to ALL in the community who wish to participate regardless of age, body type, socio economic status, race, religion, culture, physical or developmental challenges, gender identity, or any other perceived barrier to participation. We believe that everyone should have the chance to experience the benefits of circus and that everyone can benefit from circus arts. This year we managed to share circus with 15 kids who wouldn't have otherwise been able to participate in this kind of programming and in 2017 we hope to double that.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why we are fundraising:</h3>
<p>In 2016, our first year, we broke even. I am really proud of this as a small business owner. That said, looking at our spring semester, we are predicting a $3000.00 short fall in basic operations expenses. We also need to replace some key supplies such as fabrics with holes. There is building maintenance that needs to be done, including a termite treatment. These are all things that we have to do to keep going. If we exceed our goal, we will even be able to buy a new crash pad!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Circus education is on the forefront of youth development programming. Circus programs like ours are having success across the country impacting youth and adults from all walks of life and helping to build strong communities and individuals. Check out:   <a href=""http://www.americanyouthcircus.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.americanyouthcircus.org/</a> for more info on circus programs and social circuses throughout the country!</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The challenge to running any business and any youth organization is always money! I have managed to run this by myself and save make it possible to do with little funding just by doing everything myself and working many, many, many hours each week. I know that I can overcome all challenges that arise because of my hard work and dedication and also because of the support of my community. I am eternally grateful to each and every student and family and couldn't do this without the community around me!</p>

<p>I know with every fiber of my being, that this opportunity was made for me. I get to fulfill my dream of changing lives, but on a much grander scale! So, I am buying this fitness studio!</p>
<p>As with any business venture, there are always risks involved. There will be months where we may not break even, there will be facility and equipment improvements needed, there will be attorney fees, marketing investments made, so I need <i>your</i> help to be as prepared, financially, as possible for when these circumstances arise.</p>

<p>Statistics show that lack of accountability is one of the major reasons that people don't achieve their goals. I want to change that by being your own personal and professional accountability partner. To thank you for your support, I will act as a coach/mentor to help lead and guide you to the next step of your journey to health--whatever that might be for you, personally. Not only can you get one-on-one coaching sessions (where we can discuss what you are doing, where you want to be, and what needs to shift to get you there) but you can also receive access to a private community where you can also check-in, ask questions, and receive answers, training tips, and support from a trained professional (yours truly!).    </p>

We compared them with some Riedells borrowed from another skater. However when we tried the Renos, they felt better after a few laps so we bought them. Time passed, we skated more, we tried on more skates as and when someone came along with the same sized foot and a new exotic magical setup. As skills started to feel better in others skates we began tweaking.Nowadays we have a completely custom setup, one that we have painstakingly tweaked and modified as we've learnt more about our own skating and what we need from equipment based on our sizes, weights, strengths and weaknesses.

The universe grants us with our greatest desires.When you really want something, the entire universe conspires in helping you to achieve it. And guess what….that is not a secret…it’s magic!
Let me introduce myselfI am Azima and I love inspiring people to discover their blissful and lovable selves! I have always found it pretty hard to answer the question “what is your job?”… and that’s because wanting people to be happy could not be considered as an actual profession.  I am master reiki, heartfulness meditation instructor, dramatherapist, actress, singer, I  am daughter,  I am companion, girlfriend, wife, mother…I am the best friend you ever had!
I am a therapist... a healer in every way! I am a happy, grateful woman!Join my campaign and help me fulfill my dream, here, in Greece.
Azima Place Café and Store is the dream of my life. It is a place for everyone. A place where we will be offering joy, laughter and love through everyday actions. It is a place where arts and acting meet alternative treatments, helping people to find their true self…helping them find happiness. In Azima Place Café and Store, people will find out whatever is missing from their lives. Love, joy, friends, laughter, work, but most of all inspiration, optimism and courage to make their dreams come true… just like we did!

If you choose to support my dream, you will be supporting the dream of many others. Dimitris’ dream for example, is to teach acting in classes open to everyone, from children to elderly people. 


Veta’s dream is to turn cooking into a creative performance. Using traditional homemade Mediterranean recipes and inviting both couples and children to join her, she wants to help them improve their relationships and make them stronger.She calls her dream “Eros Cooking Recipes”.
Veta Betini, my mother, i will like to share with you the following short filmActress | lyricist | tv persona | businesswoman | lovely big mamma VetaBiography Documentary LOVELY BIG VETA Director Kalliopi LegakiGreece 2000 | 23 Min | OmU Englishhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5j1U9Fr5Fs

 

Elisavet’s dream is to make her first exhibition including self-created pieces of art…She is our daughter and these are her own hand made paintings she is almost 8 years now, but the paintings starts from 3,5 years old!!! We are proud !!!

 
 
and the “dreams’ list” goes on….
In Azima Place Café and Store healing and meditating crystals fill our place with their unique energy.
We meditate, we exchange reiki therapies, we take yoga lessons, we dance, we cook, we give our own theatrical performances and we LOVE. We love our lives and we dare to dream while staying here, in Greece. Come and visit us and you will be treated with a lot of traditional food and love. And  until then, you will have a special place in my heart, in my meditation and in my prayers.
Continue to stand for what you love. And shine your light in the world!
Thank you for your time and energy

I will like to share with you, a Poem by C. P. Cavafy
""Ithaca""When you set out for distant Ithaca,fervently wish your journey may be long, —full of adventures and with much to learn.Of the Laestrygones and the Cyclopes,of the angry god Poseidon, have no fear:these you shall not encounter, if your thoughtremains at all times lofty, — if selectemotion touches you in body and spirit.Not the Laestrygones, not the Cyclopes,nor yet the fierce Poseidon, shall you meet,unless you carry them within your soul, —unless your soul should raise them to confront you. Fervently wish your journey may be long.May they be numerous — the summer morningswhen, pleased and joyous, you will be anchoringin harbours you have never seen before.Stay at the populous Phoenician marts,and make provision of good merchandise;coral and mother of pearl; and ebonyand amber; and voluptuous perfumesof every kind, in lavish quantity.Sojourn in many a city of the Nile,and from the learned learn and learn amain. At every stage bear Ithaca in mind.The arrival there is your appointed lot.But hurry not the voyage in the least:’twere better if you travelled many yearsand reached your island home in your old age,being rich in riches gathered on the way,and not expecting more from Ithaca. Ithaca gave you the delightful voyage:without her you would never have set out:and she has nothing else to give you now. And though you should find her wanting, Ithacawill not surprise you; for you will arrivewise and experienced, having long since perceivedthe unapparent sense in Ithacas.

<h3>WHY SHOULD YOU HELP?</h3>
<p>Jiu-Jitsu has become my life, not a part, but my whole life. Unfortunately however being a full-time athlete in my sport is not as glorified as NBA or NFL. Being a full-time athlete also means that I cannot work a normal job because I have to fully commit to this sport. Though I have worked hard over the last 6 months doing as many hours, whether that's doing personal training or teaching kids, the money is simply not enough. This is why I need your contribution.</p>
<p>You contribution could be the difference between me winning gold at IBJJF 2016 Mundials or coming home empty handed. The hours I am putting in week to week, and the sacrifices I have made, and will make in the coming future, will result to nothing if I cannot make it to California to compete.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</h3>
<div>Where do I start. There is of course the small challenges such as sleeping on a friend's couch or a floor for 3 months so I can train at my camp in New York. Then there is the lack of money to eat good home-cooked meals and having to put up with tuna and 2-minute noodles. The biggest risk I face as an athlete however is something that we all can relate to. What if I fail again? The thought of not winning this year makes me feel like I am going to vomit.</div>
<div>Unfortunately this is also a part of this life. I have accepted this risk and the thought not winning is what pushes me through the tough hours of training and makes sleeping on the floor and eating 2-minute noodles seem all right. </div>

<p>This summer we've decided to do the silliest thing you're likely to hear about all year. We're taking part in ""the Mongol Rally"".</p>
<p>What's the Mongol Rally you ask? Described by the organisers as the greatest motoring adventure on the planet, the Mongol Rally is a cross-continental car journey for charity. It will take us from London to the capital of Mongolia over 15,000KM away, across 2 continents and 17 countries.</p>
<p>Once we leave Ireland, we'll have no fixed route, no backup and no support, just three ill-prepared amadáin, a sea of red tape and some coffee-stained maps.</p>
<p>The best part? We're doing it in a car that's about as dodgy
as some of the former Soviet states we're driving through.
Forget 4x4's, think Nissan Micra's and Toyota Starlets.

<p> None of us are any good at hurling, in fact we're pretty awful. This isn't stopping us though, and if we manage to raise €1000 in this IndieGoGo we promise to bring our terrible skills and utilise them in some of the most far flung places you can imagine. Fancy some photos of us playing hurling over the gates of hell? Or maybe a quick puck of the sliotar whilst we wait for the Iranian border guards to let us through. Whatever happens we promise to get as many photos of us playing hurling in as many different locations as we can.

<p>Want to make us really sweat? We've volunteered our dignity for this goal and we're going to push the car for a mile in the searing desert heat in nothing but our underwear and shoes. Yes really.

</div></div>","Amadáin; plural of Amadán, the Irish for fools/idiots. We think it suits.
What's It All About?
This summer we've decided to do the silliest thing you're likely to hear about all year. We're taking part in ""the Mongol Rally"".
What's the Mongol Rally you ask? Described by the organisers as the greatest motoring adventure on the planet, the Mongol Rally is a cross-continental car journey for charity. It will take us from London to the capital of Mongolia over 15,000KM away, across 2 continents and 17 countries.
Once we leave Ireland, we'll have no fixed route, no backup and no support, just three ill-prepared amadáin, a sea of red tape and some coffee-stained maps.
The best part? We're doing it in a car that's about as dodgy
as some of the former Soviet states we're driving through.
Forget 4x4's, think Nissan Micra's and Toyota Starlets. 
We're going to transverse deserts and mountain ranges in a car
that would probably struggle to make it the local shop. 

Why?The trip is in aid of the Cork Simon Community, a fantastic local charity who work closely with the men and women who are homeless in Cork, offering housing and support, and helping them on their journey back to independent living. They offer invaluable services to some of the most vulnerable people in Cork, including a nightly soup run, an emergency shelter and a healthcare team.

<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;"">What is Viewpoint Envision?</h3>
<p>Viewpoint Envision is a desktop PC compressed into the size of a book, without taking away from power or increasing price. The Viewpoint PC is aimed for everyone, it has multiple uses for any type of environment. It is very affordable making it a good choice for schools, it's also small making it a good choice for the work environment, the RAM is easily upgradable plus it has two mini-PCIe slots making it good for PC superusers, it packs power making it good for gaming and it also has all the bells and whistles needed for home use.</p>
<p>So now we are gonna get into all the technical stuff, so be prepared. The Envision PC is based off the Intel NUC form factor, Intel NUC is like a Mini-ITX motherboard, but even smaller. With the Intel NUC motherboard we can fit standard NUC parts in without having to search really hard for them. We will first start off with Intel Celeron chips, most likely the the Celeron 847, then once we get enough money from sales we can work our way up to a Core i7.</p>
<p>The base model (Envision 100) is sold for $199 and comes with a Celeron 847, 120 GB SSD, 2 GB of DDR3 1333 Mhz RAM, Intel HD Graphics, Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 7260 + Bluetooth 4.0.</p>

What We Need & What You Get
 Now I will explain a little bit more about the project, I will break down some of teh ideas.  We need at least $400 in funding to create the Viewpoint Envision, $800 is our goal. When money is donated it is used to buy parts for the computer, this allows us to finish our prototype and build the final product. $100 goes to the prototype and $700 goes to the product.  Our perks are designed to make everyone a part of the project, if you donate $100 we will engrave your name on the inside of the Envision. If our campaign does not become fully funded, we will use the money to complete our final prototype.
Extra money that is donated will go into making Viewpoint Envision with the Core i series processors (Core i3/i5/i7).    More details:  This project is valuable to you because it creates a better widely a alive Windows counterpart to the Mac Mini and is important to the world because requires less materials to build reducing the effect on the envoriment. In the past we have had succes with our other projects such as Viewpoint Aid, we want to have the same success story for our Viewpoint Envision. Our goal is also to build trust with our supporters by delivering the Envision on time and with no delays, we also won't use the money for personal uses.    Risks & Challenges There are many risks and challenges we have to overcome to have a succesful project.  The largest challenge we have is actually getting funding, many people will look at our campaign, few will actually contribute. Other challenge is that there are thousands of campaigns like this one, with so many it is very hard for one to choose what one they want to contribute to.
Our last challenge is that we need to try to work out a deal with Chenbro for the case that is affordable, this is extremely difficult because they are not very well known in the US. For now we can buy them from eBay, but we have to pay extra to get it shipped to our office in the US. 
To overcome these challenges we will try everything we can, it won't be easy but every one of these can be fixed.

<h3>Project Summary</h3>
<p>Yield Technologies cares about helping people to grow more, while damaging the planet less. We’ve taken technology we discovered at a UK university, and we’re scaling it up and getting it to the people that need it in the developed and developing world.</p>
<p>In our tests to date, we’ve seen a yield increase of more than 42% in some crops, without any more conventional fertilizer or other changes. At the same time, we’ve improved the nutritional content of those crops, making them better for the people that eat them and improving health. That’s why we think we can help to sustainably feed the world with this, if only we can get it out there at prices people can afford – and that means scaling up our production process.</p>
<p>Plants need minerals to grow and stay healthy, just like humans need vitamins. Two of the minerals plants need are iron and silica. Currently, when farmers in the west add iron and silica to their crops, they have to use iron chelate or silicic acid  – expensive chemicals which aren't great for the environment.</p>
<p>We’ve found that tiny particles of iron help the plant to grow, by improving the rate of photosynthesis (the way the plant catches the suns energy), and helping seeds to germinate. We've also found that tiny particles of silica help the plant to grow stronger and get bigger. We package our tiny particles with a natural protein, which not only helps the plant to take the minerals up, but help it to grow as well.</p>
<p>Our campaign will help us to speed up development, and allow us get this new technology directly to the people that need it most, rather than working through multinational agri-chemical companies. Going down that conventional route is likely to slow things down, and make the end product prohibitively expensive for those in the developing world. That is not our goal.</p>
<p>With your help, we can immediately improve the livelihoods of farmers in the developing world, improve the nutrition and health of the people they feed, and sustainably provide this technology to them cheaply, year after year.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>At the moment, our production process is slow and laborious – indeed a lot of it has to be done by hand. That limits the amount of product we can make, and makes it very expensive. But because we have a completely new product and process, we can’t just go out and buy production machinery to make it – the machinery doesn’t exist. Instead, we’re going to have to develop our production process and machinery ourselves, and that is where you come in. By contributing to our campaign, you’ll help us to scale up our production so that we can make the end product available and affordable to farmers in the developing world. We're a keen and experienced group of engineers and chemists. We're not rich, but we've already put a lot of our own money and time into getting the product this far. We feel now is the time to 'go big'. (We're also not creatives, as you can probably tell by our videos and artwork! More on that later...) </p>
<p>We think we need around $100000 to get us to a place where we can make the product cheaply enough to be affordable for certain crops in the developing world. This amount will allow us to create a single production line. </p>
<p>Here’s roughly how we get to that figure:</p>
<table border=""1"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0""><tbody>
<tr>
<td style=""width:331px;""><p>Method refinement and proving</p></td>
<td style=""width:285px;""><p>$10000</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style=""width:331px;""><p>Initial production machinery</p></td>
<td style=""width:285px;""><p>$20000</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style=""width:331px;""><p>Scaled up production machinery</p></td>
<td style=""width:285px;""><p>$50000</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style=""width:331px;""><p>Testing and independent accreditation of the product</p></td>
<td style=""width:285px;""><p>$20000</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p> </p>
<p>We also need help proving out our product on plants. Lots of plants, in lots of environments. The more evidence we have that this approach can work, the more governments and NGO's will stand up and realize that traditional fertilizer is not the only way. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>What do we give you in return for helping us? Well, we realize that the benefits of such a 'wonder fertilizer' may be hard to believe. And our trial production process is now providing us with small volumes of product. So what better way to show people the difference than to post out samples? For each donation of $10, we will post out a 1 gram sachet of additive from the first batches, which are being produced by hand right now! 1 gram of our additive is enough to dose 17.5 litres of water, which can then be used to water your plants in the normal way - with or without your usual fertilizer. Full instructions will be included with sample sachets. Ideally, if you have two plants side-by-side then you too can witness the difference by treating only one and not the other! If you're not a grower yourself, but believe this is a great project, there is the option to donate $5, which comes with a great big THANKYOU on our part.</p>
<p>Larger donations will receive further sachets, for instance enough for small greenhouses or vegetable gardens. Even better, if you want to get involved in working out just how good the fertilizer is, then please see the 'Big Science' section below!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What if we don't raise enough?</h3>
<p>If we don’t get to our total, we'll be disappointed. However, we’ll have progressed a long way towards our goal and will have reduced the cost of the product substantially by starting to work through the steps above. We'll carry on investing our own time and money, but crucially, if we have to take venture capital funding, it may mean we lose control of the price of our product, preventing use in the developing world.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Big Science</h3>
<p>Want to get involved in a worldwide trial? Then read on! We’ve tested our iron and silica on quite a few plants and got great results so far. But there’s a limit to the number of tests we can do; and that’s where you come in.</p>
<p>You can really help us by taking one of our science kits and growing some plants for us - some with our product and some without - then sharing your results. So, you might choose to grow blueberries. We’d ask you to plant four blueberry plants (or take four blueberry seedlings), and water them like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>       Water only</li>
<li>       Water plus iron</li>
<li>       Water plus silica</li>
<li>       Water plus iron and silica</li>
</ol>
<p>If you normally use plant food, then use that too, crucially making sure that each plant gets the same amount.</p>
<p>Then, over the weeks that follow, take some simple measurements and some photos, and tell us if the plant grew bigger and stronger, and whether it produced more fruit.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter whether you grow indoors or outside.</p>

</div></div>","Project Summary
Yield Technologies cares about helping people to grow more, while damaging the planet less. We’ve taken technology we discovered at a UK university, and we’re scaling it up and getting it to the people that need it in the developed and developing world.
In our tests to date, we’ve seen a yield increase of more than 42% in some crops, without any more conventional fertilizer or other changes. At the same time, we’ve improved the nutritional content of those crops, making them better for the people that eat them and improving health. That’s why we think we can help to sustainably feed the world with this, if only we can get it out there at prices people can afford – and that means scaling up our production process.
Plants need minerals to grow and stay healthy, just like humans need vitamins. Two of the minerals plants need are iron and silica. Currently, when farmers in the west add iron and silica to their crops, they have to use iron chelate or silicic acid  – expensive chemicals which aren't great for the environment.
We’ve found that tiny particles of iron help the plant to grow, by improving the rate of photosynthesis (the way the plant catches the suns energy), and helping seeds to germinate. We've also found that tiny particles of silica help the plant to grow stronger and get bigger. We package our tiny particles with a natural protein, which not only helps the plant to take the minerals up, but help it to grow as well.
Our campaign will help us to speed up development, and allow us get this new technology directly to the people that need it most, rather than working through multinational agri-chemical companies. Going down that conventional route is likely to slow things down, and make the end product prohibitively expensive for those in the developing world. That is not our goal.
With your help, we can immediately improve the livelihoods of farmers in the developing world, improve the nutrition and health of the people they feed, and sustainably provide this technology to them cheaply, year after year.
 

What We Need
At the moment, our production process is slow and laborious – indeed a lot of it has to be done by hand. That limits the amount of product we can make, and makes it very expensive. But because we have a completely new product and process, we can’t just go out and buy production machinery to make it – the machinery doesn’t exist. Instead, we’re going to have to develop our production process and machinery ourselves, and that is where you come in. By contributing to our campaign, you’ll help us to scale up our production so that we can make the end product available and affordable to farmers in the developing world. We're a keen and experienced group of engineers and chemists. We're not rich, but we've already put a lot of our own money and time into getting the product this far. We feel now is the time to 'go big'. (We're also not creatives, as you can probably tell by our videos and artwork! More on that later...) 
We think we need around $100000 to get us to a place where we can make the product cheaply enough to be affordable for certain crops in the developing world. This amount will allow us to create a single production line. 
Here’s roughly how we get to that figure:


Method refinement and proving
$10000


Initial production machinery
$20000


Scaled up production machinery
$50000


Testing and independent accreditation of the product
$20000


 
We also need help proving out our product on plants. Lots of plants, in lots of environments. The more evidence we have that this approach can work, the more governments and NGO's will stand up and realize that traditional fertilizer is not the only way. 
 
What You Get
What do we give you in return for helping us? Well, we realize that the benefits of such a 'wonder fertilizer' may be hard to believe. And our trial production process is now providing us with small volumes of product. So what better way to show people the difference than to post out samples? For each donation of $10, we will post out a 1 gram sachet of additive from the first batches, which are being produced by hand right now! 1 gram of our additive is enough to dose 17.5 litres of water, which can then be used to water your plants in the normal way - with or without your usual fertilizer. Full instructions will be included with sample sachets. Ideally, if you have two plants side-by-side then you too can witness the difference by treating only one and not the other! If you're not a grower yourself, but believe this is a great project, there is the option to donate $5, which comes with a great big THANKYOU on our part.
Larger donations will receive further sachets, for instance enough for small greenhouses or vegetable gardens. Even better, if you want to get involved in working out just how good the fertilizer is, then please see the 'Big Science' section below!
 
What if we don't raise enough?
If we don’t get to our total, we'll be disappointed. However, we’ll have progressed a long way towards our goal and will have reduced the cost of the product substantially by starting to work through the steps above. We'll carry on investing our own time and money, but crucially, if we have to take venture capital funding, it may mean we lose control of the price of our product, preventing use in the developing world.
 
Big Science
Want to get involved in a worldwide trial? Then read on! We’ve tested our iron and silica on quite a few plants and got great results so far. But there’s a limit to the number of tests we can do; and that’s where you come in.
You can really help us by taking one of our science kits and growing some plants for us - some with our product and some without - then sharing your results. So, you might choose to grow blueberries. We’d ask you to plant four blueberry plants (or take four blueberry seedlings), and water them like this:

       Water only
       Water plus iron
       Water plus silica
       Water plus iron and silica

If you normally use plant food, then use that too, crucially making sure that each plant gets the same amount.
Then, over the weeks that follow, take some simple measurements and some photos, and tell us if the plant grew bigger and stronger, and whether it produced more fruit.
It doesn’t matter whether you grow indoors or outside.
Our science kits will provide everything you need to do the experiment except soil and seeds:

         4 pots
         Tape measure
         Watering can
         Iron and silica product
         Measuring cylinders
         Instructions

When you have some results, you can send them to us at results@yield-tech.co.uk, or post them on our facebook page. We'll keep a log of all the results, concentrating our efforts on promising crops first. We will post full credits to those who have helped.

The obstacles we face in scaling up are understanding our production process in real detail, from the basic chemistry that’s going on, through the way the product flows through the process, and the physical and chemical limits that we need to stay within to produce quality product in volume.

<p><strong>Enna Chocolate is moving to Exeter and needs your support!</strong></p>
<p><i><strong>Our dream of having a large production space that is part bean-to-bar chocolate factory and part cafe with retail space is within reach!  We have found the perfect space in Exeter (hello neighborhood!) and our build-out has begun. The Covid-19 pandemic has slowed us down a bit but it won't stop us. Your help in this final push is needed more than ever so we can scale up production and say a big hello to all our new visitors in Exeter.</strong></i></p>
<p><strong>Some Background</strong></p>
<p>In 2015 while working as a food photographer I learned that I could make chocolate at home. With a small investment of about $300 I bought a tabletop grinder, ordered a few pounds of fermented dried cocoa beans and started teaching myself the process. After months of trial and error I finally started getting the results I wanted and I started sharing my chocolate with the chefs I was doing food photography for. The chefs wanted to buy some. So I got a license to make chocolate for sale from our home kitchen. Chocolate requires a LOT more space than what's available in the typical home kitchen, so after I started receiving more orders than I could fulfill in that tiny space, my husband Matt and I built a production kitchen in Epping in 2017. Epping has provided a wonderful startup home for our business, and we will forever be grateful to the Epping community for their support and enthusiasm. However, Enna Chocolate is now bursting at the seams at the current location and we need room to grow!</p>

<p><strong>Building the Dream</strong></p>
<p>We love sharing our adventure that is chocolate, and we want to offer a broader chocolate experience to our customers than what is possible in our current space. So we have leased a new space in Exeter NH and we'll be able to expand our customer experience in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>EXPANDED chocolate tasting and retail area with a coffee bar.</li>
<li>A 6x6 foot glass viewing window so that visitors can watch the chocolate production process from the retail space.</li>
<li>BEVERAGES! We are SO excited to add coffee, espresso, and DRINKING CHOCOLATE to our offerings, plus a few other cacao related refreshments. Have you ever tried fresh cacao juice? Yum! </li>
<li>A COMMUNITY SPACE ~ before there were coffee houses, did you know that the world's great cities had chocolate houses? Our 'chocolateria' will be a welcoming and inspiring place for all to gather. We LOVE the conversations and connections that are inspired by our chocolate craft, and we are very excited to offer a bigger and better space for these special interactions to happen.</li>
</ul>
<p>We love sharing our chocolate journey with others, and hope you'll join us on this latest phase of our adventure!</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We are seeking to raise at least $25,000. This will help us outfit the cafe with an espresso machine and all the accoutrements necessary to serve our favorite cacao, coffee, and tea beverages.  If we surpass our initial funding goal, we have a really special ""stretch goal"" in mind. </p>
<p>In our previous Indiegogo campaign we learned that the most desired perk was CHOCOLATE. So this time around we're again offering our most popular chocolate perks, but we're also offering some fun cafe perks, and of course some very nifty swag.</p>
<p><strong>What if we don't meet our funding goal?</strong> We are moving to Exeter no matter what. If we don't meet the initial funding goal, we will build the cafe service portion of our move in a later phase.</p>
<p><strong>What if we surpass our funding goal?</strong> We have a couple of ""stretch"" goals for our fundraising campaign.</p>
<ul>
<li>$25,000 = <strong>Rock &amp; Roll Goal</strong> ~ Our initial goal will help us crank out our buildout, including coffee &amp; espresso &amp; drinking chocolate equipment</li>
<li>$30,000 = <strong>Nest Egg Goal</strong> ~ this will give us just a little bit of cushion so we can breath easier during the uncertainty brought to the months ahead of us by the Covid-19 pandemic.</li>
<li>$40,000 = <strong>Gussy Up Goal</strong> ~ If we surpass our initial goal by a LOT, we're excited to finally design custom moulds for our chocolate bars (we've been anxious to upgrade from the generic grid-bar design). </li>

In 2014, we started the first and, until today, only relatively large-scale mushroom farm in Palestine. The idea for our project began over a BBQ, when we wanted to grill fresh mushrooms but could only find Israeli grown options.

In 2014, we started the first and, until today, only relatively large-scale mushroom farm in Palestine. The idea for our project began over a BBQ, when we wanted to grill fresh mushrooms but could only find Israeli grown options. Israel imposes a military occupation that controls every single bit of our lives. So, on that fateful day, despite our hunger, we did not want to consume the Israeli mushrooms and could not see a reason why we couldn’t grow our own. So, we embarked on a journey of research, education, and training and set up the farm. We called it ‘Amoro', a name inspired by stories of the Amorites people who lived in Palestine around 2000 to 1600 BC.Importing a top-quality spore infused compost from the Netherlands, we began producing closed-cap white mushrooms. Our staff consisted of women from local vulnerable communities. It didn’t take long for Amoro mushrooms to become a hit; people were eating all that we produced. And right when we thought about expanding and making our own compost, our reality of living under occupation hit home. Israeli authorities began to stall our compost imports, which must go through Israeli ports. Four containers containing compost were stalled at the Ashdod sea port an average of 49 days each time costing us more than $60,000 in port fees only. It was a clear targeting of our farm. We imported from the Netherlands, with whom Israel has very strong trade relations. We also bought from the same source Israeli mushroom farms buy from, but while Israeli farms continued to produce mushrooms with support and subsidy from their government, our production was stalled and our losses accumulated. We wrote to the port authorities through our lawyer each time but received no answer. We are now developing our legal challenge to what we believe are arbitrary restrictions imposed on us by Israel. It is a long process and in the meantime we need to continue to produce to maintain the farm.We are asking your help to make up for some of what we lost in port fees.  Help us raise $30,000 which we will use to:1- Build a compost storing space (refrigerated)  that will help us mitigate any similar obstacles we may face in the future and allow production continuity. This costs around $10,0002- Ensure proper maintenance of the farm including by upgrading filters, sensors, humidifiers, growing nets, and pulling wench. These upgrades will ensure that we produce top quality and highly competitive product.  All will cost around $10,0003- Buy a steam boiler to ensure best hygienic practice, costs around $10,000  With your help we can keep producing, satisfying Palestinian love for mushrooms, maintaining independence, and investing in a better future for Amoro and our communities. Please donate any amount, every little helps. Please do get in touch, we will be more than happy to answer your questions or just chat with you about Amoro",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>My name is Tracy Stocker and I have been involved in animal rescue since moving to Oregon in 1997. My career in veterinary medicine spanned 15 years and I focused on feline care as cats are my passion.  In addition, I became actively involved in local cat rescue in 2012 and have held 6 positions with agencies including Core Paws, Cat Adoption Team, Felines First Rescue and Animal Aid, Inc. I even have a job that focuses on cat care as I have owned and operated my own small business, When You're Not There Pet Care, here in Oregon since 2009. I live, breathe and sleep felines! Anything I can do to provide them and their caregivers with the best, most up to date health, behavior and welfare information is my goal. Happy, healthy cats live long and tranquil lives! </li>
<li>My Indiegogo campaign to get Purrs and Pastries Cat Cafe up and running is based on the idea that Portland is ready for it's next cat cafe featuring highly adoptable, friendly cats and kittens searching for their forever families! I will build a cafe featuring some of the area's best and favorite cupcakes, pies and cakes along with delectable coffee, teas and juices from local businesses. Portland is proud of it's home-grown artisans and the closeness and support we show each other; my cat cafe will also host a small art gallery featuring local crafters along with a retail area with some of the best cat themed tees, jewelry, gifts, toys and enrichment supplies. Everything a kitty caregiver could need!</li>
<li>By contributing to our campaign to launch our start up, you will not only make a huge difference in the lives of local cats needing families, but also with supporting a much needed retail space that will foster community togetherness, feature local special events and fun activities and a great place to relax and enjoy truly delectable desserts! There will be something for everyone at Purrs and Pastries Cat Cafe! Especially if you are a lover of all things feline. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552330564/uroqoqtey4canbcj1aoq.jpg"" src=""""/>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need to fundraise $30,000 to cover our startup costs including rent, construction, cafe equipment &amp; supplies and cat room ""catification"" and our fundraising Perks gifts. The cafe and cat room will be outfitted with comfortable and stylish seating and tables along with a few lounging chairs and sofas. We will also offer key-lock lockers for your personal belongings so nothing gets lost, stepped on or stolen while you are visiting the kitties. </li>
<li>You'll love the decor with light and bright colors, soothing color schemes and interesting and unique textures; for the comfort of cats and people alike. </li>
<li>If we don't reach our full goal, all donated funds will go towards the most immediate need which is securing the leased property. We would need to look at starting ""smaller"" by having less square feet than originally hoped for; thus limiting the size of the cafe and retail spaces. Once the property is leased, the primary goal is to offer the cats the larger room space, with the cafe being one half the square footage of the cat room. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552330596/cnyuotd6qojp1wdd8j8g.jpg"" src=""""/>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>This campaign is valuable to the community because it will fill a niche on Portland's west side. Adoptable cats and kittens will find temporary housing in the Cat Room and will be available to meet so many folks which will help socialize them and prepare them to meet their forever family. </li>
<li>This venture will be my 4th small business in the PNW (3 in Oregon and 1 in Washington) and I know that I will not only bring my business skills, love of cats and enthusiasm to this concept; but also my heart. Helping cats, and the people who love them, is what really makes me tick. I've spent the past 9 years building my other small business (When You're Not There Pet Care) and have garnered so much happiness, a great base of clients and a real level of success in my career. I know that with the connections that I have made in the animal welfare community in the Portland area; this too will be a wonderful place for cat lovers to come and enjoy their time spent in a great atmosphere with really great food and beverages!</li>
<li>Portland's homeless cat population continues to grow year by year; I know that by adding the newest concept in 'adoption centers' via a brand new Cat Cafe....we will find hundreds of cats and kittens their forever homes! </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are always challenges that present themselves when opening a new small business! As an entrepreneur, I know that hurdles are meant to be overcome. Since I have run 3 other small pet related businesses in the Pacific Northwest since 1998; I feel that I have garnered a lot of experience and problem solving skills over the years. Combining my past career experiences in retail management, food and beverage industry and well, ....being 'the boss' has provided me with a firm foundation to grow upon. I feel that all of my past jobs, skills, experiences and knowledge from all of my other endeavors have culminated to bring me here; to opening Purrs and Pastries Cat Cafe. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552331758/zzjt0srkkkbkbmt4gttd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>I think the largest risks are associated with owning and operating a food and beverage establishment focusing on offering pastries, desserts, coffees, teas and other light beverages.  There are many food and beverage choices in the community and being proactive in advertising and marketing will be critical to our success.  I know that the food and beverage items we plan to carry are great quality items and many community members already love them. Having another venue to dine in or carry them out will appeal to many folks and their families. </li>
<li>My plan for overcoming challenges is to gather information; from patrons, from staff members and volunteers and other cat cafe owners. There are unique instances that apply only to cat cafes: cats transmitting zoonotic diseases to visitors, cats potentially injuring visitors, cats escaping from the cat room, etc. Combining a cafe and a cat adoption center will be new; but the trend of cat cafes has already hit the US and many business owners are friendly with each other and willing to lend helpful advice. We are all in the game to get more homeless cats adopted while offering wonderful, tasty treats in a spot that is fun and relaxing. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul>
<li>We'd love if you could help us raise much needed funds to cover the initial start up costs, but if you can't, we'd appreciate you spreading the word among your cat (and cupcake) loving friends, family and neighbors! </li>
<li>Please use the Indiegogo share tools to help us share our venture! By visiting or just sharing our dream-come-true by word of mouth.....you're helping! Thank you!</li>

I know that with the connections that I have made in the animal welfare community in the Portland area; this too will be a wonderful place for cat lovers to come and enjoy their time spent in a great atmosphere with really great food and beverages!
Portland's homeless cat population continues to grow year by year; I know that by adding the newest concept in 'adoption centers' via a brand new Cat Cafe....we will find hundreds of cats and kittens their forever homes! 


Risks & Challenges
There are always challenges that present themselves when opening a new small business! As an entrepreneur, I know that hurdles are meant to be overcome. Since I have run 3 other small pet related businesses in the Pacific Northwest since 1998; I feel that I have garnered a lot of experience and problem solving skills over the years. Combining my past career experiences in retail management, food and beverage industry and well, ....being 'the boss' has provided me with a firm foundation to grow upon. I feel that all of my past jobs, skills, experiences and knowledge from all of my other endeavors have culminated to bring me here; to opening Purrs and Pastries Cat Cafe. 

I think the largest risks are associated with owning and operating a food and beverage establishment focusing on offering pastries, desserts, coffees, teas and other light beverages.  There are many food and beverage choices in the community and being proactive in advertising and marketing will be critical to our success.  I know that the food and beverage items we plan to carry are great quality items and many community members already love them. Having another venue to dine in or carry them out will appeal to many folks and their families. 
My plan for overcoming challenges is to gather information; from patrons, from staff members and volunteers and other cat cafe owners. There are unique instances that apply only to cat cafes: cats transmitting zoonotic diseases to visitors, cats potentially injuring visitors, cats escaping from the cat room, etc. Combining a cafe and a cat adoption center will be new; but the trend of cat cafes has already hit the US and many business owners are friendly with each other and willing to lend helpful advice. We are all in the game to get more homeless cats adopted while offering wonderful, tasty treats in a spot that is fun and relaxing.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your donation will give someone in need a life-saving experience. It is proven that spending time in nature reduces stress, anxiety, and depression and improves general mental health and well-being.  And studies have shown time outdoors is effective treatment for combat veterans as well as abused women suffering PTSD. Bushcraft Ridge is the only primitive camping experience in the region dedicated to community outreach. We will continually raise funds to to pay for attendance and supplies for those who need them most, while also maintaining the natural beauty of the property.</p>
<p>Equal to our commitment to community is our commitment to the environment. Bushcraft Ridge will preserve a unique swath of Tennessee hill country in its raw and natural state. Our programs are designed with conservation in mind. By selectively removing dead-standing trees and clearing underbrush, we will actually improve the health of the forest. And by thoughtfully scheduling attendance, we will prevent overcrowding and draining the forest's resources.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are many campgrounds out there. So what sets Bushcraft Ridge apart? </p>
<ul>
<li>More than just a camping experience, Bushcraft Ridge allows attendees to use the landscape and all it offers to practice primitive survival skills, from fire starting to trapping to shelter building---all done with conservation in mind using methods that actually improve the forest, instead of stripping it of its resources.</li>
<li>We are huge fans of bushcraft schools, like the Pathfinder School. But their programs are highly intensive. They require weeks of physical training before even an able-bodied adult should attend. And the cost can be prohibitive for many. Bushcraft Ridge will offer a more recreational experience that is also educational. We want you to be able to learn the joy of bushcrafting no matter your age, physical health, or finances.</li>

More than just a camping experience, Bushcraft Ridge allows attendees to use the landscape and all it offers to practice primitive survival skills, from fire starting to trapping to shelter building---all done with conservation in mind using methods that actually improve the forest, instead of stripping it of its resources.
We are huge fans of bushcraft schools, like the Pathfinder School. But their programs are highly intensive. They require weeks of physical training before even an able-bodied adult should attend. And the cost can be prohibitive for many. Bushcraft Ridge will offer a more recreational experience that is also educational. We want you to be able to learn the joy of bushcrafting no matter your age, physical health, or finances.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What is the Bean Center for Gifted Enrichment and Support?</strong></p>
<p>The Bean Center (TBC) is a unique gifted enrichment center, dreamed up and founded by a veteran teacher (me!) with a love for gifted kids and a passion for making a difference in the lives of children.</p>
<p>I was so tired, year after year, of the lack of services for my middle school gifted kids. One teacher for the whole school? No program? It was an afterthought in most cases. And finally, I said, enough. We should just outsource the parts of gifted programming that are missing.</p>
<p>So here I am.</p>
<p>Our model is exciting in that we serve gifted students outside of the typical school experience. Think of us like “gifted outpatient care”-- almost like a Kumon learning center meets group therapy meets an internship, mixed with hands-on activities, guest speakers and sprinkled with teacher and parent trainings and...voila! </p>
<p>We serve small groups of students ages 10-15 (kids outside of that welcome, but that is the target) in three areas: </p>
<p><strong>Explorations</strong>, where we play and dig deeply into high interest topics</p>
<p><strong>Survival</strong>, which is a social-emotional course designed specifically for gifted students (this has a parent component)</p>
<p>And <strong>Genius Hour</strong>, which are student-led, teacher-guided passion projects assisted by a community mentor as appropriate. These projects promote productive struggle, motivation, soft skills, and support students’ areas of relative weakness, and result in an outcome specific to the student and the project (for example, a 3-D printed collapsible snowboard or a photography exhibit that deal with stress). </p>
<p>The sky is the limit, and students can repeat the modules as often as they like (the goal is to have different levels and topics in the survival pod once we have multiple staff).</p>
<p>We also do parent and teacher trainings to help the adults better serve and support gifted behavior development.</p>

placed in Las Malvinas, a low income neighborhood in the heart of Santo
Domingo, Dominican Republic. Our factory will produce handcrafted,
all-natural soaps with the island's showcase ingredients. Our soap
will be made by the women of Las Malvinas, who will have now a steady income. We'll sell our soaps to several customer segments
- such as tourists and businesses - on the island and abroad.</p><p></p><p><b>MADE FOR HOPE.</b> We placed our soap factory inside Las Malvinas, to bring
jobs and empowerment to women that want a brighter future for themselves and
their children. Esperanza Soaps hires and trains the women of Las Malvinas,
most of whom have not had the opportunity of a steady job, and struggle to make
ends meet.</p>
<p><b>DOMINICAN GOODNESS - A SOAP YOU’RE
HAPPY TO USE AND PROUD TO GIVE TO OTHERS. </b>Esperanza Soaps are unique: made with the best of the
Caribbean - all natural, local ingredients like coconuts, mangoes and passion
fruit; cacao, coffee and rum, herbs grown locally such as lavender, peppermint
and aloe. We offer deep moisturizing soaps, aloe-based soaps to keep your skin
smooth and healthy, a wide variety of exfoliating soaps and soaps for the
morning, the evening and special occasions. It’s good for you, and a perfect,
meaningful gift for those you love!</p>
<p><b>SOAP MAKES LIFE BETTER. </b> We make soap because soap is good for you! Most of us
take soap for granted, but it has the power to keep us clean and
healthy, and it helps prevent sickness like diarrhea or infectious
diseases. In one year two million children are killed from diarrhea. 41 percent
of these tragic deaths could be prevented by the simple act of hand washing
with clean water and soap. Esperanza Soaps will make soap available for the
community of Las Malvinas, and implement hand washing programs for kids and
adults. In a place without a sewer system like Las Malvinas, soap can make a
huge impact and save lives.  </p>

around the world that have worked diligently to get our soap business ready.
And now we’re good to go! We need your pledge to get this business off the

<p></p>
<p><b>Why a soap factory, and why Las Malvinas?</b></p>
<p>We’re starting our factory in Las
Malvinas because there we’ve met strong devoted women we truly believe in. With
your pledge we can run our company for a full year: hire a team of business
professionals and women. We can equip a soap factory in the community and start
producing our all natural, dominican soaps. Soap making is easy to learn, can
be made in a kitchen, and will allow us to scale production quickly. For more
information, please continue reading.</p>
<p><b>We believe poverty is wrong. </b>We can, and must, eradicate it. We’ve started Esperanza
Soaps because it’s a chance to empower women to lift themselves and their
families from poverty for good. </p>
<p><b>No
one should be condemned to live a life of poverty. Not here. Not anywhere.</b></p>
<p>Esperanza Soaps focuses on women
employment because we’ve seen how the mothers in this community go far and
beyond to invest in their children and their futures. They put their income
into sending their sons and daughters to school, to keep them well-fed and
healthy. We share their hope for their children, and we’ve created Esperanza
Soaps as a way of putting means in their hands to do so. </p>

</span></b><b>What do you
need the money for?</b></p>
<p>When we meet our goal of $75,000, we
will have <b>working capital for 1 year.</b></p>
<p>We will:</p>
<p><b>a.<span> 
</span></b><b>Hire staff:</b> Five women in the community will be trained in
making/curing soap. We will also send Kevin Moforte (see below for a short bio) as the manager of Esperanza Soaps for one year. We also need local
business staff (design, marketing and sales), a security guard, etc.</p>
<p><b>b.<span> 
</span></b><b>Equip a soap
factory/laboratory: </b>A soap lab requires a space with
power and utilities. Making soap needs a modern oven, a stove  and a long
list of tools, utensils  and shelf space. </p>
<p><b>c.<span> 
</span></b><b>Purchase the
materials for first batch.</b> All the basic
ingredients we require can be purchased locally and in bulk.</p>
<p><b>d.<span>

making soap?</b><br/></p>
<p><b>Soap
is easy to learn how to make.</b>
It’s a lot like making bread – almost anyone can pick it up, but not everyone
will practice enough to become good at making it. It also involves lots of
creativity – to combine new ingredients successfully, to come up with new
recipes and to try new scents. </p>
<p><b>a.<span>  </span></b><b>Soap can be made in a kitchen. </b>A company making large amounts of soap, like Esperanza
Soaps, needs a large space to cure the soaps for several weeks, but the making
of the soap itself can be done in a large kitchen with an oven.</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>b. </b></span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Soap making is scalable.</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> In one afternoon a team can make 12 bars of soap or

     One of the goals in creating this company was to create products that make
     life better. Soap is one of them, especially in communities without
     sewerage like Las Malvinas.</span></p><p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">d. The ingredients needed to make soap are easily
     procured.</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> The main ingredients are oils
     and lye, which are readily available in the Dominican Republic.  </span></p>
<p><b>3.<span>  </span></b><b>Who are you going to sell the soap to?</b></p>
<p>Our target customer segments are <b>tourists
and high income Dominicans</b>. Every year, five million tourists come to the
country to enjoy its sandy beaches and resorts. These tourists bring back home
millions of dollars’ worth of souvenirs and gifts such as rum, tobacco and
handcrafted goods. The Dominican government is investing heavily to double the
number of visitors by 2022, so our main consumer market will expand strongly in
the next years. </p>
<p><b>4.<span>  </span></b><b>How do you know this business will be a success?</b></p>
<p>Every business venture has risks. We
have been diligently researching and consulting with a talented team of
professionals to understand our industry and market dynamics. Among the people

</span></b><b>“Esperanza Soap
will be a for-profit social business”. What does that mean?</b></p>
<p>A social business is a business that
maximizes its social impact while being financially sustainable and independent
from a constant stream of donations. Because it operates like a for-profit, it
generates revenue that covers its costs and allows it to grow.</p>
<p>A social business is different from
a traditional for-profit business in that a social business’ goal is <b>to
maximize its social impact</b>, not to maximize its profits at any cost.</p>
<p>The social impact Esperanza Soaps
generates is empowering very poor families to rise from poverty by giving them
employment opportunities. We are committed to employing people trapped in
extreme poverty, persisting in giving them training and a steady income. Our
impact is. specifically in Las Malvinas:  </p>
<p>a)  Provide stable employment
and a steady income to women that currently are living on less than 2 dollars a
day, and have sporadic sources of income. This will allow them to spend more on
essentials (food – more and better, clothing, repairing their homes) and invest
in their families (sending their kids to school well fed, providing the school
supplies they need from uniforms to materials requested). </p>
<p>b)  Make soap available in the
community and train women to be health promoters – so people of Las Malvinas,
especially children, develop the habit of hand washing with soap 5 times a day.
There is vast literature that sustains hand washing with soap as one of the
most effective programs to improve the health of a community, especially one
with no sewerage, like Las Malvinas. Please refer to our website for this: <a href=""http://www.upward-ventures.org/resources"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>www.upward-ventures.org/resources</span></a>.

<p><b>9.<span>  </span></b><b>What is the relationship between Upward Ventures and
Esperanza Soaps?</b></p>
<p>Upward Ventures is a nonprofit
organization that starts social businesses in low income communities like Las
Malvinas in the Dominican Republic, to bring jobs and empowerment to families
living in poverty. It conducts the community discovery meetings, the market
research and fundraising for its ventures. Once an idea gets proven and turns
into a startup, it is released and turned into a for-profit company. </p>
<p>Upward Ventures’ headquarters are in
Amherst MA, USA, and will soon open offices in Santo Domingo, Dominican

<p><b>10.</b><b>I understand you want to focus on women, but what about the

<p>These are legitimate concerns, and
as a community-based company we are mindful of the relations amongst the

placed in Las Malvinas, a low income neighborhood in the heart of Santo
Domingo, Dominican Republic. Our factory will produce handcrafted,
all-natural soaps with the island's showcase ingredients. Our soap
will be made by the women of Las Malvinas, who will have now a steady income. We'll sell our soaps to several customer segments
- such as tourists and businesses - on the island and abroad.MADE FOR HOPE. We placed our soap factory inside Las Malvinas, to bring
jobs and empowerment to women that want a brighter future for themselves and
their children. Esperanza Soaps hires and trains the women of Las Malvinas,
most of whom have not had the opportunity of a steady job, and struggle to make
ends meet.
DOMINICAN GOODNESS - A SOAP YOU’RE
HAPPY TO USE AND PROUD TO GIVE TO OTHERS. Esperanza Soaps are unique: made with the best of the
Caribbean - all natural, local ingredients like coconuts, mangoes and passion
fruit; cacao, coffee and rum, herbs grown locally such as lavender, peppermint
and aloe. We offer deep moisturizing soaps, aloe-based soaps to keep your skin
smooth and healthy, a wide variety of exfoliating soaps and soaps for the
morning, the evening and special occasions. It’s good for you, and a perfect,
meaningful gift for those you love!
SOAP MAKES LIFE BETTER.  We make soap because soap is good for you! Most of us
take soap for granted, but it has the power to keep us clean and
healthy, and it helps prevent sickness like diarrhea or infectious
diseases. In one year two million children are killed from diarrhea. 41 percent
of these tragic deaths could be prevented by the simple act of hand washing
with clean water and soap. Esperanza Soaps will make soap available for the
community of Las Malvinas, and implement hand washing programs for kids and
adults. In a place without a sewer system like Las Malvinas, soap can make a
huge impact and save lives.  
We’re a team of 35 passionate staff and volunteers from all
around the world that have worked diligently to get our soap business ready.
And now we’re good to go! We need your pledge to get this business off the
ground!

Why a soap factory, and why Las Malvinas?
We’re starting our factory in Las
Malvinas because there we’ve met strong devoted women we truly believe in. With
your pledge we can run our company for a full year: hire a team of business
professionals and women. We can equip a soap factory in the community and start
producing our all natural, dominican soaps. Soap making is easy to learn, can
be made in a kitchen, and will allow us to scale production quickly. For more
information, please continue reading.
We believe poverty is wrong. We can, and must, eradicate it. We’ve started Esperanza
Soaps because it’s a chance to empower women to lift themselves and their
families from poverty for good. 
No
one should be condemned to live a life of poverty. Not here. Not anywhere.
Esperanza Soaps focuses on women
employment because we’ve seen how the mothers in this community go far and
beyond to invest in their children and their futures. They put their income
into sending their sons and daughters to school, to keep them well-fed and
healthy. We share their hope for their children, and we’ve created Esperanza
Soaps as a way of putting means in their hands to do so. 
1. 
What do you
need the money for?
When we meet our goal of $75,000, we
will have working capital for 1 year.
We will:
a. 
Hire staff: Five women in the community will be trained in
making/curing soap. We will also send Kevin Moforte (see below for a short bio) as the manager of Esperanza Soaps for one year. We also need local
business staff (design, marketing and sales), a security guard, etc.
b. 
Equip a soap
factory/laboratory: A soap lab requires a space with
power and utilities. Making soap needs a modern oven, a stove  and a long
list of tools, utensils  and shelf space. 
c. 
Purchase the
materials for first batch. All the basic
ingredients we require can be purchased locally and in bulk.
d. 
Set up sales
channels.  Most of our customers frequent
the same locations. We are exploring the most efficient setup and partnerships
to distribute our products. 
e.  Transportation: A (used) pickup truck for daily operations. 2. 
Why are you
making soap?
Soap
is easy to learn how to make.
It’s a lot like making bread – almost anyone can pick it up, but not everyone
will practice enough to become good at making it. It also involves lots of
creativity – to combine new ingredients successfully, to come up with new
recipes and to try new scents. 
a.  Soap can be made in a kitchen. A company making large amounts of soap, like Esperanza
Soaps, needs a large space to cure the soaps for several weeks, but the making
of the soap itself can be done in a large kitchen with an oven.b. Soap making is scalable. In one afternoon a team can make 12 bars of soap or
     1200 bars of soap.c. Soap is good for you.
     One of the goals in creating this company was to create products that make
     life better. Soap is one of them, especially in communities without
     sewerage like Las Malvinas.d. The ingredients needed to make soap are easily
     procured. The main ingredients are oils
     and lye, which are readily available in the Dominican Republic.  
3.  Who are you going to sell the soap to?
Our target customer segments are tourists
and high income Dominicans. Every year, five million tourists come to the
country to enjoy its sandy beaches and resorts. These tourists bring back home
millions of dollars’ worth of souvenirs and gifts such as rum, tobacco and
handcrafted goods. The Dominican government is investing heavily to double the
number of visitors by 2022, so our main consumer market will expand strongly in
the next years. 
4.  How do you know this business will be a success?
Every business venture has risks. We
have been diligently researching and consulting with a talented team of
professionals to understand our industry and market dynamics. Among the people
working with us are business professors and students of the Isenberg School of
Management of UMass Amherst, social entrepreneurs, business owners, and
nonprofit directors. 
First, our soaps are already
generating demand. We are receiving offers for our
soaps in the price range we expect to sell on the island. In customer product
testing, our soaps are consistently described as premium and high quality.
People comment very favorably on their feel, smell and appearance, and the
social impact the soaps’ production has increases their value for our target
customers. 
Second, we are at the confluence of
three promising trends:
a) 
Demand for handmade, natural
products is on the rise. In markets across the world handmade soap has appeared
as a response for people’s desire to use natural soaps that do not contain
harmful or synthetic chemicals. 
b) 
Tourists, especially Millennials,
which are our main customer segment, are expected to double in the coming
years. 
c) 
Demand for premium goods is on the
rise in the Dominican Republic. Economic growth has spurred a middle and high
income population demanding premium goods. 
Third, we know the community and the
culture. 
Our team and manager have extensive
experience working in the Caribbean. We started a pilot last year making soap
in the community, proving not only the interest the people have, the
availability of space and workers, but also the ease to procure materials.

Upward Ventures and Practivistas collaborated with Las Malvinas to build the water cistern and a popular pharmacy, and will work jointly on integrating the factory into the community and conducting practical research for new products and ventures. 6. Are you training the women to be soap entrepreneurs?No. The women will be hired by Esperanza Soap and have a guaranteed income as employees of the company.

                 </p>
<p>With your help, Haiti will soon have a new attraction to talk
about. Kiskeya Water Park, will be Haiti’s first ever family entertainment
water park. Our country has experienced devastation from natural disasters and
economic turmoil and the people of Haiti need opportunities to thrive, learn
and grow. We also hope to encourage and promote tourism so that the world can
experience how great Haiti is. We see Kiskeya Water Park as the answer.</p>
<p>Our project is a 1-acre outdoor water park featuring signature
rides for kids and adults of all ages and a wonderfully designed area for local
visitors and tourists. The park will provide visitors with a wholesome
environment, amusement, entertainment, excitement, competition, souvenirs and
great food and beverages all while forming lasting memories.</p>
<p>Currently a large gap exists in the entertainment offerings in
Haiti, and Kiskeya Water Park has positioned itself to fill this
void. We intend to build an experience that is unique, participative and
fun. Quality entertainment is a main focus coupled with the type of
adventure the current market demands. Our Team is working with Aquakita
Group Development to assist in planning, engineering, and design of this one of
a kind park.  </p>
<p> <b>What We
Need &amp; What You Get                
                     
     </b></p>
<p>Kiskeya Waterpark Campaign hopes to raise $250,000 USD through
Indiegogo to create a vibrant and sustainable water park, that will support our
community and attract tourists to contribute to the Haitian economy. My wife

<br/></div>","Short Summary                 
                     
                 
With your help, Haiti will soon have a new attraction to talk
about. Kiskeya Water Park, will be Haiti’s first ever family entertainment
water park. Our country has experienced devastation from natural disasters and
economic turmoil and the people of Haiti need opportunities to thrive, learn
and grow. We also hope to encourage and promote tourism so that the world can
experience how great Haiti is. We see Kiskeya Water Park as the answer.
Our project is a 1-acre outdoor water park featuring signature
rides for kids and adults of all ages and a wonderfully designed area for local
visitors and tourists. The park will provide visitors with a wholesome
environment, amusement, entertainment, excitement, competition, souvenirs and
great food and beverages all while forming lasting memories.
Currently a large gap exists in the entertainment offerings in
Haiti, and Kiskeya Water Park has positioned itself to fill this
void. We intend to build an experience that is unique, participative and
fun. Quality entertainment is a main focus coupled with the type of
adventure the current market demands. Our Team is working with Aquakita
Group Development to assist in planning, engineering, and design of this one of
a kind park.  
 What We
Need & What You Get                
                     
     
Kiskeya Waterpark Campaign hopes to raise $250,000 USD through

community and attract tourists to contribute to the Haitian economy. My wife
and I have committed $10,000 in additional capital and our business partner
Mrs. Eunisse, was very excited to invest $25,000 dollars to support the
project.

<p><strong>Francine Scott</strong></p>
<p><a href=""http://womanfirstinstitute.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>http://womanfirstinstitute.org</strong></a></p>
<p>My birth into 1960s Glasgow prepared me well for passionate living and a career that has embraced roles within fashion, business, conservation and military service. In a life devoted to the events I recount, I live in a country cottage, where I am currently at work on the next wave of content for The Woman First Institute and the second volume of the Woman First Chronicles.</p>
<p>With a weakness for exquisite dresses, silk lingerie and a classic high heel, my feminism does not rest merely on equality. How a woman reminds herself of the sheer joy of being a woman is a business men can only envy and serve. This phenomenon is erotically charged with nuanced possibilities that have led me to explore the absolute power of female sexuality and the understanding that female fulfillment is the key to human prosperity and happiness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                                   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474713449/ezqtozliwt00nnj33ci7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p>With something of a scarcity of discerning content in the provision for this market, my creative endeavors have sought to fill this gap. Coming First - Vol 1 of The Woman First Chronicles tells the story of how four women founded The Woman First Institute <a href=""http://womanfirstinstitute.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://womanfirstinstitute.org</a>  At its core is erotic seduction and humor, but its underlying, political and philosophical implications are as much a part of its message as any sexual gratification. In no small way, the Woman First Institute is playing its part in promoting the virtues of gynarchy and female led relationships.</p>

<h3><strong>Gynarchy, Feminism, Female Supremacy, Male Subordination and  Feminization</strong></h3>
<p>The Woman First Institute is dedicated to the political tenet of a benevolent female autocracy over men, where the democratic principles of femocracy give rise to every woman's right to the feminarchy of her choice. Such utopian ideology requires support from all its prospective citizens. We urge all women and men, who wish to see this in their lifetime, to declare their interest now! Women, natural-born or trans, and men alike have a unique opportunity, here and now, to shape The Woman First Institute. As well as a mind-blowing abundance of perks from which to choose, by becoming a Contributor, you will be supporting women in their female led relationship(s), aiding their way to a satisfying, orderly, polyandrous/polyamorous life. Your contribution to male chastity, feminization, cuckoldry, obedience and subservience will never be surpassed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474678649/dix0ngmxrdh6rlnddcqc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In 2017, all known penises must be declared. Male citizens will be duty bound to register for Penis Tax, subjecting their attached appendages to the meticulous scrutiny of the Penis Tax Inspectorate. In their service as Sissies, Servitors, Studs and Tran-Sisters, adherence to their assigned masturbation temperance regime will be rigorously enforced.</p> <h3>Campaign Aims                                      </h3>
<p>In addition to the next volume of The Woman First Chronicles, the Institute plans to introduce a raft of new content to satisfy its growing following. Exclusively Woman will launch next summer. Its women-only content will entertain, inform and guide our female following on how to come first. Exclusively Woman extends a hand to every woman, helping her through her female led relationship(s) and aiding her way to a satisfying, orderly, polyandrous/polyamorous life.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Next summer also sees the launch of the Penis Tax, an affordable, monthly levy to which our growing male following can contribute. Overseen by the Penis Tax Inspectorate, all revenues raised will fund The Woman First Treasury. As privileged recipients of exclusive content, Penis Tax payers will be expected to comply with their assigned masturbation temperance regime as well as being richly informed of what they are missing.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Panty Slavery is also part of our planning. This is a rare opportunity to hand-wash and press our defiled panties to perfection. This privilege will be carried out by devotees who are willing to spend their time and resources in this most intimate of subservient tasks. Accordingly, subscribers will be given a full and detailed account of how the soiled panties in their charge came to be in the condition in which they find them.</p>
<p>The Woman First Institute <a href=""http://womanfirstinstitute.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://womanfirstinstitute.org</a> is keen to capitalize on the purchase options its viewership is making. Clothing is of particular interest. With multiple affiliate marketing opportunities made possible upon its launch, development of online shopping is underway for lingerie, dresses, hosiery and shoes nuanced to the particular interests of our growing audience.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>    <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478197047/gnikn7ulzzuapjjhrmwi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Opening in April 2017, The House of Woman First online department store will serve our growing following with only the finest made-to-measure and ready-to-wear lingerie, dresses, hosiery and shoes in Real Girl Fit (for women) and Sissy Fit (for M/F trans-women). In addition to this, it is our privilege that the talented Jane Cunningham is contributing her exquisite, haute-couture services to our campaign. Jane has designed a collection of made-to-measure, pure silk lingerie and nightwear in both Real Girl Fit (for women) and Sissy Fit (for M/F trans-women). Due to launch independently in the autumn/winter of 2017, the collection will arrive in time for those winter nights in and early bedtimes.</p>

<p>With most of the design and development work behind us and a plethora of content, The Woman First Institute <a href=""http://womanfirstinstitute.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://womanfirstinstitute.org</a> is backer-ready and all set to move on from its embryonic beginnings to a thriving, expanding start-up.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>The Woman First Institute <a href=""http://womanfirstinstitute.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://womanfirstinstitute.org</a> seeks funding of £28,000 to achieve its outlined goals. Broadly speaking, this breaks down as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marketing £8000</li>
<li>Launch of 'Exclusively Woman' £1500</li>
<li>Launch of the 'Penis Tax' £1500</li>
<li>Launch of 'Panty Slavery' £1000</li>
<li>Publication of the second volume of The Woman First Chronicles £1500</li>
<li>Development of online shopping £3500</li>
<li>Potential Perk fulfillment £9000</li>
<li>Indiegogo and transaction fees £2000                                  </li>
</ul>
<p>It is envisaged that our marketing budget will be 50% spend on advertising and professional services and 50% in-house. Publication of the second volume of The Woman First Chronicles, the launch of Exclusively Woman, the Penis Tax and Panty Slavery, as well as the development of online shopping are down largely to the time of content providers and developers. With funding, this is time that can be devoted, full time, to The Woman First Institute <a href=""http://womanfirstinstitute.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://womanfirstinstitute.org</a>. The content provision that already exists is testament to what can be achieved with the additional demands of other commitments. What is possible, with funding in place, is knowledge that has been hard earned.</p>

<p>Contributors can make a huge impact on the progress of The Woman First Institute <a href=""http://womanfirstinstitute.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://womanfirstinstitute.org</a>. Whilst our modest efforts in marketing have produced promising results, funded marketing will establish the brand and lead the way to implement the aforementioned plans for the next volume of The Woman First Chronicles, Exclusively Woman, the Penis Tax and Panty Slavery. With our developments in online shopping and the approaching launch of Jane Cunningham's lingerie &amp; nightwear collections, there has never been a better time to become a contributor.</p>
<p>The Woman First Institute <a href=""http://womanfirstinstitute.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://womanfirstinstitute.org</a> is a unique online presence which, as well as entertaining, is helping bring about real societal change. It offers the world an alternative to patriarchal structures, representing gynarchy to women and men alike with humor. The underlying, erotic leanings served by our appeal present many opportunities to penetrate a broad range of markets.</p>

<p>Whilst contributors may well see the business case for The Woman First Institute, a degree of empathy with our cause would benefit all of us. The Institute is keen to form partnerships with like minded individuals who are as enthusiastic as we are to see women coming first. An entirely business approach to our campaign would be welcome from contributors but it is worth bearing in mind that, whilst the Institute will continue to make progress on the web, economic uncertainties will continue to exist. Potential rewards are high but the risks need to be spread.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>All of the aforementioned plans for The Woman First Institute <a href=""http://womanfirstinstitute.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://womanfirstinstitute.org</a> carry their own risks. The diversity of their potential income streams helps to reduce those risks. Taken collectively, these plans can, at least, provide a platform for further growth. No doubt, in the coming year, not all of these plans will bear the promise they carry but they will have given us a profile from which to build further.</p>
<p>Every provision has been made to ensure that, no matter what, fulfillment of our pledges is paramount. Whatever outcomes prevail, The Woman First Institute will deliver on all of its perks.   </p>
<p>Providing content and development is the least of our unknowns. Experience has taught us how to deliver this on time and within budgets. Less known are marketing outcomes, which is why so much of the budget is set aside for this. </p>

Francine Scott
http://womanfirstinstitute.org
My birth into 1960s Glasgow prepared me well for passionate living and a career that has embraced roles within fashion, business, conservation and military service. In a life devoted to the events I recount, I live in a country cottage, where I am currently at work on the next wave of content for The Woman First Institute and the second volume of the Woman First Chronicles.
With a weakness for exquisite dresses, silk lingerie and a classic high heel, my feminism does not rest merely on equality. How a woman reminds herself of the sheer joy of being a woman is a business men can only envy and serve. This phenomenon is erotically charged with nuanced possibilities that have led me to explore the absolute power of female sexuality and the understanding that female fulfillment is the key to human prosperity and happiness.
 
                                                   
                                      https://amazon.com/dp/B01GT2OH6U
                                     https://amazon.co.uk/dp/B01GT2OH6U
 
With something of a scarcity of discerning content in the provision for this market, my creative endeavors have sought to fill this gap. Coming First - Vol 1 of The Woman First Chronicles tells the story of how four women founded The Woman First Institute http://womanfirstinstitute.org  At its core is erotic seduction and humor, but its underlying, political and philosophical implications are as much a part of its message as any sexual gratification. In no small way, the Woman First Institute is playing its part in promoting the virtues of gynarchy and female led relationships.
 
                                 
 
Founders of The Woman First Institute
http://womanfirstinstitute.org
 
Amanda Newman - Chancellor and High Priestess of Nympho-Serenity
 
Kate Glover - Dean of the Faculty of Female Fulfillment
 
Claire Paterson - Treasurer and Professor of Male Disciplinary Studies
 
Jane Cunningham - Head of Fashion, Womenswear and Feminine Frippery.
                                            
Gynarchy, Feminism, Female Supremacy, Male Subordination and  Feminization
The Woman First Institute is dedicated to the political tenet of a benevolent female autocracy over men, where the democratic principles of femocracy give rise to every woman's right to the feminarchy of her choice. Such utopian ideology requires support from all its prospective citizens. We urge all women and men, who wish to see this in their lifetime, to declare their interest now! Women, natural-born or trans, and men alike have a unique opportunity, here and now, to shape The Woman First Institute. As well as a mind-blowing abundance of perks from which to choose, by becoming a Contributor, you will be supporting women in their female led relationship(s), aiding their way to a satisfying, orderly, polyandrous/polyamorous life. Your contribution to male chastity, feminization, cuckoldry, obedience and subservience will never be surpassed.
 
                                
 
In 2017, all known penises must be declared. Male citizens will be duty bound to register for Penis Tax, subjecting their attached appendages to the meticulous scrutiny of the Penis Tax Inspectorate. In their service as Sissies, Servitors, Studs and Tran-Sisters, adherence to their assigned masturbation temperance regime will be rigorously enforced. Campaign Aims                                      
In addition to the next volume of The Woman First Chronicles, the Institute plans to introduce a raft of new content to satisfy its growing following. Exclusively Woman will launch next summer. Its women-only content will entertain, inform and guide our female following on how to come first. Exclusively Woman extends a hand to every woman, helping her through her female led relationship(s) and aiding her way to a satisfying, orderly, polyandrous/polyamorous life.
 
                                            
 
Next summer also sees the launch of the Penis Tax, an affordable, monthly levy to which our growing male following can contribute. Overseen by the Penis Tax Inspectorate, all revenues raised will fund The Woman First Treasury. As privileged recipients of exclusive content, Penis Tax payers will be expected to comply with their assigned masturbation temperance regime as well as being richly informed of what they are missing.
                                      
                                                
 
Panty Slavery is also part of our planning. This is a rare opportunity to hand-wash and press our defiled panties to perfection. This privilege will be carried out by devotees who are willing to spend their time and resources in this most intimate of subservient tasks. Accordingly, subscribers will be given a full and detailed account of how the soiled panties in their charge came to be in the condition in which they find them.
The Woman First Institute http://womanfirstinstitute.org is keen to capitalize on the purchase options its viewership is making. Clothing is of particular interest. With multiple affiliate marketing opportunities made possible upon its launch, development of online shopping is underway for lingerie, dresses, hosiery and shoes nuanced to the particular interests of our growing audience.
 
    
 
Opening in April 2017, The House of Woman First online department store will serve our growing following with only the finest made-to-measure and ready-to-wear lingerie, dresses, hosiery and shoes in Real Girl Fit (for women) and Sissy Fit (for M/F trans-women). In addition to this, it is our privilege that the talented Jane Cunningham is contributing her exquisite, haute-couture services to our campaign. Jane has designed a collection of made-to-measure, pure silk lingerie and nightwear in both Real Girl Fit (for women) and Sissy Fit (for M/F trans-women). Due to launch independently in the autumn/winter of 2017, the collection will arrive in time for those winter nights in and early bedtimes.
 
                 
              
With most of the design and development work behind us and a plethora of content, The Woman First Institute http://womanfirstinstitute.org is backer-ready and all set to move on from its embryonic beginnings to a thriving, expanding start-up.
 
What We Need & What You Get

The Woman First Institute http://womanfirstinstitute.org seeks funding of £28,000 to achieve its outlined goals. Broadly speaking, this breaks down as follows:

Marketing £8000
Launch of 'Exclusively Woman' £1500
Launch of the 'Penis Tax' £1500
Launch of 'Panty Slavery' £1000
Publication of the second volume of The Woman First Chronicles £1500
Development of online shopping £3500
Potential Perk fulfillment £9000
Indiegogo and transaction fees £2000                                  

It is envisaged that our marketing budget will be 50% spend on advertising and professional services and 50% in-house. Publication of the second volume of The Woman First Chronicles, the launch of Exclusively Woman, the Penis Tax and Panty Slavery, as well as the development of online shopping are down largely to the time of content providers and developers. With funding, this is time that can be devoted, full time, to The Woman First Institute http://womanfirstinstitute.org. The content provision that already exists is testament to what can be achieved with the additional demands of other commitments. What is possible, with funding in place, is knowledge that has been hard earned.
 
                                               
The value of The Woman First Institute is almost intangible but it is fair to say that it has every prospect of enjoying high growth. Besides a bounty of enticing perks, contributors have an opportunity to be part of a movement. All contributors will experience Amanda's Gratitude. A multitude of perks include the sexiest read of your life with Francine Scott's Coming First - Kindle Edition or Coming First - Print Edition.
 
                
It's time for insufficient husbands and boyfriends to be shown their place. Get him to sign on the dotted line. Make a Servitor of him or, better still, a Maidservant. As a contributor, you can receive an editable edition of the Cuckold Covenant to edit, print and present to your partner. The Cuckold Covenant is a postnuptial bond upon which uxorious husbands and boyfriends can take their solemn vows to serve, honor, obey and remain true to their partner whilst yielding to her divine right to seek romance and sexual gratification in another.

<h3>Fresh Eggs from Doretta Farms</h3>
<p>Our names are Kari and Ian, and we run a small farm in the Shenandoah Valley. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485319360/tqifjupyny9zurkvd3xu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Both Ian and I grew up raising chickens and gardening, but we've decided that not only do we want the reward of fresh eggs and vegetables for ourselves- we want to share that reward with others! We love working outdoors and being able to raise and grow our own food and realized that we could turn this lifestyle into a career. As an added bonus, grass fed chickens produce vastly healthier eggs than any you can find at the store.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485319626/h68fw1kmym918tfvudbv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>As our campaign indicates, we plan to focus our efforts on eggs production before eventually expanding our gardens to provide lots of delicious vegetables and herbs. Ian and I are full of ideas and energy- we've even talked about raising ducks and rabbits, and growing flowers too, maybe even honey bees- we just need your help to get there!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We plan to start with a flock of 100, and project our maximum flock size at no more than 300.</p>
<p>The funds for this campaign will be used to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Purchase a variety of hatching eggs, pullets, and full grown chickens to build our flock</p></li>
<li><p>Get fencing to expand our chicken yard</p></li>
<li><p>An egg washer/sanitizer</p></li>
<li><p>Feeders and waterers</p></li>
<li><p>Egg cartons</p></li>
</ul>
</div><div><h3>The Impact</h3></div><div>
<ul>
<li><p>This project is important to us on a very personal level, but we embark on this journey not solely for our own fulfillment, but also so that we may contribute local, healthy food to our area.</p></li>
<li><p>This isn't our first venture into small business- Ian runs a successful award winning photo and video studio in northern Virginia (Toy Box Studios). Between his business savvy, and my farm grown ambition, and our collective determination, Doretta will be making her mark sooner than you know!</p></li>
<li>Help us get outdoors and get our hands dirty!</li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>

</div><p> </p></div>","Fresh Eggs from Doretta Farms
Our names are Kari and Ian, and we run a small farm in the Shenandoah Valley. 

Both Ian and I grew up raising chickens and gardening, but we've decided that not only do we want the reward of fresh eggs and vegetables for ourselves- we want to share that reward with others! We love working outdoors and being able to raise and grow our own food and realized that we could turn this lifestyle into a career. As an added bonus, grass fed chickens produce vastly healthier eggs than any you can find at the store.

As our campaign indicates, we plan to focus our efforts on eggs production before eventually expanding our gardens to provide lots of delicious vegetables and herbs. Ian and I are full of ideas and energy- we've even talked about raising ducks and rabbits, and growing flowers too, maybe even honey bees- we just need your help to get there!
 
We plan to start with a flock of 100, and project our maximum flock size at no more than 300.
The funds for this campaign will be used to:

Purchase a variety of hatching eggs, pullets, and full grown chickens to build our flock
Get fencing to expand our chicken yard
An egg washer/sanitizer
Feeders and waterers
Egg cartons

The Impact

This project is important to us on a very personal level, but we embark on this journey not solely for our own fulfillment, but also so that we may contribute local, healthy food to our area.
This isn't our first venture into small business- Ian runs a successful award winning photo and video studio in northern Virginia (Toy Box Studios). Between his business savvy, and my farm grown ambition, and our collective determination, Doretta will be making her mark sooner than you know!
Help us get outdoors and get our hands dirty!



Risks & Challenges

Sure, every small business has challenges, and we won't be the exception. One challenge will be finding our markets- will that be primarily with restaurants? Small grocery stores? Would we work best as a CSA? Maybe we'll really shine at local markets.
Many of these questions will be answered as we move forward. We plan to be proactive in tackling this challenge by approaching restaurants directly and asking what they'd like us to grow- instead of the other way around (growing something and trying to find a buyer). Doretta will also have set business hours so people can stop by and buy eggs and produce from us even if they aren't able to make it to the weekend markets.

moved in together, with Matt officially adopting Caleb’s cats and treating them

parties at dungeons. Our first party pulled in almost 150 people and we

throwing parties turned into a dream of opening our own space to serve the
community in a whole new way. Thus, Haven SF was born.</p>

<p>The Sexual Minorities Archives has brought to Holyoke its vast holdings of books, periodicals, subject files, art, music, textiles, and multimedia comprising the diverse story of LGBTQI lives and experiences from the early 1800s to the present. The SMA has recently acquired, among hundreds of new items, The Leslie Feinberg Library and plans to provide access to those assembled 1,000 books within the Holyoke house in The Sylvia Rivera Room. The addition of the personal research library of Feinberg, the late transgender author and activist, will bring the total number of books in the SMA to over 12,000.</p>
<p>The SMA collections, open to the public, researchers, and visitors at no charge, had been housed in the Northampton residence of Ben Power Alwin, founder and executive director of the Sexual Minorities Educational Foundation, Inc. (SMEF) and curator of the Sexual Minorities Archives. SMEF, Inc. the federal 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that furthers the work of the SMA, has also relocated its offices to within the house in Holyoke. The SMA welcomed between 300 to 500 visitors each year, many of them students and professors from the Five Colleges area, and offers paid student internships and other employment opportunities for LGBTQI individuals through grants and scholarship programs.</p>
<p>We are eager to be able to provide regular open hours to these unparalleled, unique historical materials to all who come to the Pink Lady. </p>
<p>Our goal is to build a beautiful, permanent ramp built to match the exterior of the Pink Lady on the front of the house.

<h3><strong>MAKE THE MEAL A FUNNY AND CREATIVE EXPERIENCE!</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi guys! My name is Noemi, I'm a 30 years old Sardinian girl. I have been travelling a lot through Italy, Spain, UK, Mexico and Australia, and during my trips I've had a great inspiration for a possible succesful business! My project is to start a business that could change dining habits! Let me introduce you to the project!</p>
<div>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">
<br/><strong>INTERACTIVE RESTAURANT</strong>
</h2>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Make restaurant's ordering system, funny, social and creative!</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever thought about how could be cool to have the possibility to ""assemble"" your pizza by choosing between the available ingredients? and what about salads? How many times have you ordered a ""green salad"" and just once served you have found inside some vegetables you don't like? won't be better if you could choose every vegetable, fruit, sauce, of your salad????  </p>
</div>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">And what if you are<strong> vegetarian </strong>or<strong> vegan? </strong>or allergic<strong> </strong>to<strong> lactose </strong>or<strong> gluten?  </strong>I guess you always have some problems when you are about to order a meal in a restaurant... in these cases it's not easy to find the right solution for you diet needs! Well, in my restaurant, you could have the <strong>possibility</strong> to <strong>examine</strong> and <strong>personally choose every single ingredient</strong>, avoinding bad surprises! </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Thanks to your help, me and my team will be able to open the First Italian Interactive Restaurant, where customer will be the main protagonist of the business!</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>LET THE SHOW BEGINS!</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In the video below, you can see some restaurants that have already adopted this kind of technology. As you can see, it <strong>turns classics dining tables into super gigant touch screen tables. </strong>Tables are provided with a software that allows customers to ""project"" their meal from A to Z. </p>
<div> </div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>HOW DOES IT WORK? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Customers can:</strong></p>
<p>- <strong>Personalize their meal</strong> by choosing every ingredient between the ones available in the ""ingredients' lists"" in just one touch; </p>
<p>- <strong>Name and share their creations</strong> in social networks in real time;</p>
<p>- Chat directly from the tables to involve their friends;</p>
<p>- <strong>Keep contact with  restaurant's staff</strong>;</p>
<p>- Play games, <strong>read news</strong> and, of course, <strong>eat</strong>!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>WHERE AND WHEN</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Our aim is to open the first restaurant in Sardinia. We plan to start the activity in the next six months, but we need your help to raise the money!!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">This will be just the beginning of our project, because the <strong>real goal</strong> is to create a chain of restaurants under the same brand, exporting this technology in other countries.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">INTERACTIVE RESTAURANT SYSTEM: WHY IT'S SO WONDERFUL!</h3>
<p> </p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/EIzx4rvHweE?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div> </div>
<p>Now, let's understand the potential of these tables. As explained before, customers can set up their own meal by selecting the ingredients they like the most. <i>But how?  Let us give you <strong>an example to describe how  the system works.</strong></i></p>
<p>Let's suppose that a customer would like to eat a salad; he can create its own salad in the following way: </p>
<ol>
<li>In the table's screen, customer will have a virtual salad bowl and all the ingredients available; </li>
<li>Customer have to drag and drop the ingredients inside the virtual bowl. Ingredients could be, for example, tomatoes, lettuce, sweet peas, carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, meat or fish (like chicken or tuna), dry or fresh fruit, sausages, cheese, dressings and so on;</li>
<li>Once ingredients have been dragged inside the bowl, customer is welcome to give a name to his personalized and customized salad;</li>
<li>Finally, customer will send the order directly to the kitchen and the game is done.</li>
</ol>
<p>And this is just the beginning!!! this amazing system allows customers to do many more things! Tables are <strong>connected to the Internet ALL THE TIME</strong> and customers can:</p>
<p>- <strong>stay connected</strong> with social medias like <strong>Facebook</strong>, <strong>Istagram</strong>, etc;</p>
<p>- <strong>create a meal</strong> in company setting free their <strong>creativity</strong>;</p>
<p>-  <strong>socialize</strong> with new people by chatting with them through tables;</p>
<p>- <strong>share creations</strong> (like meals, drinks, salads, etc) and any other content with friends through <strong>social medias</strong>;</p>
<p>- <strong>share</strong> any content of the table storage like <strong>videos, pictures and music</strong>;</p>
<p>- <strong>play games</strong> like, for example, ""fruit ninja"" and many others while waiting for the meal;</p>
<p>- have a look to what is happening in the kitchen in real time, thanks to a <strong>video camera </strong>linked to the tables;</p>
<p>- have a look to <strong>news, meteo</strong> and so on.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as previously mentioned, tables are linked each other, so <strong>customers can chat through tables</strong>, send postcards or offer to other guests any product available in the menu with just one click!<br/>And, of course, customers can make orders and payments through the table, without having to wait for the assistance of a staff member!</p>
<p>Obviously, if customers need <strong>assistance</strong>, they can call a staff member through tables and these ones will be glad to help.</p>
<p>Every application listed above is showed in the videos uploaded in this page. For this reason, I invite you to watch carefully each video. The videos come from our partner Kodisoft.</p>

<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">WHY DO WE NEED YOUR HELP?</h3>
<p> </p>
</div>
<p>The budget collected will cover the following expense:</p>
<p>- Purchase and transport of tables. Seventy percent of the budget will be absorbed by this expense;</p>
<p>- three wood-burning ovens equipped with rotating and ""up and down"" technology. In order to fulfill to italian laws, one of the ovens will be completely dedicated to gluten free pizzas and others gluten free bakery products, to avoid any contamination of the food and help celiac people to taste the best food ever.</p>
<p>- Professional training courses;</p>
<p>- Kitchen equipment:  fridge, deep fryers, sinks, dishwasher, hobs, bar counter etc.;</p>
<p>- Website;</p>
<p>- Restructuring and adjustment costs of room and toilets to comply with Italian health laws regarding restaurants;</p>
<p>- Marketing and promotional campaign;</p>
<p>- First supply of good including.</p>
<p>If the entire goal won't be reached, the money will be dedicated, at first, for the supply of the tables and for professional training courses.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">BUSINESS MODEL</span></strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>INTERACTION, CREATIVITY AND CUSTOMIZATION</strong>:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">these three elements constitute the <strong>SOUL</strong> of our business.</p>
<p>In our restaurant <strong>customers </strong>will be <strong>the main protagonist</strong>; <strong>every service, product, event and game will be evaluted, rated and also proposed by customers</strong>. How? thanks to the possibility  they'll have to like or dislike products and services leaving feedback visible to everybody; to interact with management leaving messages to propose new ideas related to the business. In this way <strong>customers will</strong> have the possibility to <strong>participate to the creation</strong> of new value, for themselves, for the business and for other customers. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>PRODUCTS AND SPECIAL NEEDS</strong></p>
<p>Nowadays, many people are experiencing problems of intolerance with some aliments that contains lactose or gluten; others have chosen to adopt a vegetarian or vegan diet and have difficulties to find a good offer of these kind of dishes in restaurants.</p>
<p><strong>For these reasons, we have decided to offer a selection of ingredients and goods that respect different diet choices and special diet needs.</strong></p>
<p>For <strong>vegans </strong>and <strong>lactose intolerant</strong>, mozzarella will be replaced by a mozzarella free of milk and others aliments of animal origin; meat will be replaced by soy meat and  meat sousages will be replaced by soy/tofu/vegetable sousages; cow milk will be replace by almond/soy/nut milk and so on.</p>

Hi guys! My name is Noemi, I'm a 30 years old Sardinian girl. I have been travelling a lot through Italy, Spain, UK, Mexico and Australia, and during my trips I've had a great inspiration for a possible succesful business! My project is to start a business that could change dining habits! Let me introduce you to the project!


INTERACTIVE RESTAURANT

 
Make restaurant's ordering system, funny, social and creative!
Have you ever thought about how could be cool to have the possibility to ""assemble"" your pizza by choosing between the available ingredients? and what about salads? How many times have you ordered a ""green salad"" and just once served you have found inside some vegetables you don't like? won't be better if you could choose every vegetable, fruit, sauce, of your salad????  

And what if you are vegetarian or vegan? or allergic to lactose or gluten?  I guess you always have some problems when you are about to order a meal in a restaurant... in these cases it's not easy to find the right solution for you diet needs! Well, in my restaurant, you could have the possibility to examine and personally choose every single ingredient, avoinding bad surprises! 
Thanks to your help, me and my team will be able to open the First Italian Interactive Restaurant, where customer will be the main protagonist of the business!
 
LET THE SHOW BEGINS!
 
In the video below, you can see some restaurants that have already adopted this kind of technology. As you can see, it turns classics dining tables into super gigant touch screen tables. Tables are provided with a software that allows customers to ""project"" their meal from A to Z. 
 
HOW DOES IT WORK? 
Customers can:
- Personalize their meal by choosing every ingredient between the ones available in the ""ingredients' lists"" in just one touch; 
- Name and share their creations in social networks in real time;
- Chat directly from the tables to involve their friends;
- Keep contact with  restaurant's staff;
- Play games, read news and, of course, eat!
 
WHERE AND WHEN
 
Our aim is to open the first restaurant in Sardinia. We plan to start the activity in the next six months, but we need your help to raise the money!!
This will be just the beginning of our project, because the real goal is to create a chain of restaurants under the same brand, exporting this technology in other countries.
 

INTERACTIVE RESTAURANT SYSTEM: WHY IT'S SO WONDERFUL!
 

 
Now, let's understand the potential of these tables. As explained before, customers can set up their own meal by selecting the ingredients they like the most. But how?  Let us give you an example to describe how  the system works.
Let's suppose that a customer would like to eat a salad; he can create its own salad in the following way: 

In the table's screen, customer will have a virtual salad bowl and all the ingredients available; 
Customer have to drag and drop the ingredients inside the virtual bowl. Ingredients could be, for example, tomatoes, lettuce, sweet peas, carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, meat or fish (like chicken or tuna), dry or fresh fruit, sausages, cheese, dressings and so on;
Once ingredients have been dragged inside the bowl, customer is welcome to give a name to his personalized and customized salad;
Finally, customer will send the order directly to the kitchen and the game is done.

And this is just the beginning!!! this amazing system allows customers to do many more things! Tables are connected to the Internet ALL THE TIME and customers can:
- stay connected with social medias like Facebook, Istagram, etc;
- create a meal in company setting free their creativity;
-  socialize with new people by chatting with them through tables;
- share creations (like meals, drinks, salads, etc) and any other content with friends through social medias;
- share any content of the table storage like videos, pictures and music;
- play games like, for example, ""fruit ninja"" and many others while waiting for the meal;
- have a look to what is happening in the kitchen in real time, thanks to a video camera linked to the tables;
- have a look to news, meteo and so on.
Furthermore, as previously mentioned, tables are linked each other, so customers can chat through tables, send postcards or offer to other guests any product available in the menu with just one click!And, of course, customers can make orders and payments through the table, without having to wait for the assistance of a staff member!
Obviously, if customers need assistance, they can call a staff member through tables and these ones will be glad to help.
Every application listed above is showed in the videos uploaded in this page. For this reason, I invite you to watch carefully each video. The videos come from our partner Kodisoft.


 


WHY DO WE NEED YOUR HELP?
 

The budget collected will cover the following expense:
- Purchase and transport of tables. Seventy percent of the budget will be absorbed by this expense;
- three wood-burning ovens equipped with rotating and ""up and down"" technology. In order to fulfill to italian laws, one of the ovens will be completely dedicated to gluten free pizzas and others gluten free bakery products, to avoid any contamination of the food and help celiac people to taste the best food ever.
- Professional training courses;
- Kitchen equipment:  fridge, deep fryers, sinks, dishwasher, hobs, bar counter etc.;
- Website;
- Restructuring and adjustment costs of room and toilets to comply with Italian health laws regarding restaurants;
- Marketing and promotional campaign;
- First supply of good including.
If the entire goal won't be reached, the money will be dedicated, at first, for the supply of the tables and for professional training courses.

 
BUSINESS MODEL
 
INTERACTION, CREATIVITY AND CUSTOMIZATION:
these three elements constitute the SOUL of our business.
In our restaurant customers will be the main protagonist; every service, product, event and game will be evaluted, rated and also proposed by customers. How? thanks to the possibility  they'll have to like or dislike products and services leaving feedback visible to everybody; to interact with management leaving messages to propose new ideas related to the business. In this way customers will have the possibility to participate to the creation of new value, for themselves, for the business and for other customers. 
PRODUCTS AND SPECIAL NEEDS
Nowadays, many people are experiencing problems of intolerance with some aliments that contains lactose or gluten; others have chosen to adopt a vegetarian or vegan diet and have difficulties to find a good offer of these kind of dishes in restaurants.
For these reasons, we have decided to offer a selection of ingredients and goods that respect different diet choices and special diet needs.
For vegans and lactose intolerant, mozzarella will be replaced by a mozzarella free of milk and others aliments of animal origin; meat will be replaced by soy meat and  meat sousages will be replaced by soy/tofu/vegetable sousages; cow milk will be replace by almond/soy/nut milk and so on.
For people with celiac disease, will be used the special gluten free flour to make pizzas and other products. In the same way, will be selected a range of ingredients free of gluten.
 
RISKS & CHALLENGES
 

Cagliari it's a small city, so it's easy to create some buzz, especially when it comes from technological innovation. Cagliari's people are curious and love to have fun; we never lost a social event, a pub inauguration or a cool party. Exciting news are really rare in a such small city.

For these reasons, we think the inauguration will be a real success: we expect to have every seat busy and, hopefully, to have a long line at the entrance to come in and try these shiny new tables!
Furthermore, we expect a so positive result because, with this innovation, we are going to  touch the most sensitive strings of our future customers: to have the possibility to express themselves, and be for once actors and not mere spectators.

People LOVE to involve their friends, and be involved in their friends' lives through social networks! In the same way, we LOVE all new devices that allow us to do such things. If you combine this with the possibility to have fun creating a personalized meal, the game is done!  WE ARE SOCIAL. People have never been so much interconnected and we like that! The result? Smartphones have become an extension of our arm because internet has become the expression of our thoughts. Finally we can share our thoughts with a wide range of people, comparing ourselves with them and their points of view.
After initial excitement, the challenge will be to make sure that consumers will continue to visit the restaurant; this goal will be pursued trying to create a deep connection through customer and the business.
As told before, consumers will be involved continuously in business decisions, making them feeling the protagonist and the centre of the business; secondly, restaurant will offer ONLY fresh food and ingredients of high quality, renewing the ""ingredients list"" and menu proposals based on seasonal availability of aliments; furthermore, will be organized many contests aiming to involve and reward clients and many events to entertain them and keep their satisfaction level high.

<h3>10 Carden (10C) is the hub for community activators and changemakers in Guelph.</h3>
<p>We welcome groups and individuals into an inclusive community of social change organizations working across sectors and engaging in collaborative work. Our tangible offering is affordable downtown co-working and event meeting space. Our immeasurable benefits extend to inclusion, connection, collaboration, creativity, and developing new ways of solving social challenges. </p>
<p><strong>People work, meet, eat, create, connect and brainstorm together at 10C. </strong></p>
<p>10 Carden is in its 8th year and is expanding - and this growth is being realized through the redevelopment of a historic landmark in the core of our city, the former Acker's Furniture building, located at 42 Carden Street. The project is being undertaken by 10 Carden and Chalmers Community Services Centre as the property owners and core building tenants, and together, will activate the entire building.</p>
<h3>In early 2017, we will open this fully accessible 15,000 square feet location. Help 10 Carden finish this community space!<br/> </h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478577736/yx8ohqppu2khm70hnt4o.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>10C is making space for community connections that foster: collaborations, new ideas, professional and social networks that build urban integration, resilience and establish the scaffolding for Guelph residents to work on complex issues together. All of these are important as Guelph (and other cities) grow in population due to provincial mandating and as challenges of urban living become more complex (i.e. water supply, energy costs, access to civic space, diversity, direct democracy and social inclusion). 10C helps people form connections and collaborate.</p>
<h3>Support through this campaign will help finish the main floor and the second floor community gathering spaces.<br/> </h3>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478577752/ybx2numwryjvbufm4is5.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<ul>
<li><h3>Save the Date - we are planning an amazing community party on April 29, 2016.</h3></li>

</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479266597/ujf5dx9add5s3hrzsqtc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>The first $10,000 raised </strong>through this campaign will finish the Carden Street Gallery-Lounge, which will become an active gathering space and act as the main entrance to 10C. This area needs new flooring and finishing carpentry, including reinstallation of tin ceiling to welcome visitors into the space.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>The next $8,000 raised </strong>will help to refinish the warehouse floor, and add lighting, seating and furnishings on the 2nd floor Sunroom and Library area. This sunny spot will be a key area for people to meet, read, research and brainstorm. This is also the future home of the Out on the Shelf Library, Guelph's LGTBQ+ community resource centre. Hundreds of people will gather here weekly to soak up the sun and enjoy the views of Market Square. <strong>Join friends new and old in the space and be part of the action! </strong><br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>The next $5000 raised </strong>will also help build and finish the gender-neutral barrier-free bathroom on the second floor. As noted, the building is full of practical and accessible features and our bathrooms are going to rock! <br/> </li>
<li>Finally, any direct funds raised for the <strong>Acker's Sign Restoration</strong> will go towards the restoration of the large Acker's Furniture sign, which graced Carden Street from 1956 to 2016. The sign is currently in storage with Signs Galore in Breslau, awaiting its glorious return.<br/> </li>

<h3>What you get in return...</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fun Perks Include: Stickers! T-Shirts! Photo Portraits! <strong>Get your name memorialized! </strong>This is your chance to join in the adventure and be part of this transformation of this landmark space. <strong>The opening party - one of our key perks will be a blast! Bring a friend or bring 10. With over 200 people coming to our bare-bones construction site opening in spring 2016, we are expecting a full-house!</strong>
</li>
<li>What if you don't reach your campaign goal? Well, if we don't reach our goal, we will focus on the main floor space and complete as much of the work as possible. But, <strong>we really hope that you can help us reach the goal</strong>, and have created perks to provide you value, connection and enjoyment. </li>
<li>And if we exceed our goal, then we will continue to add magic to the 3rd and 4th floors!</li>
</ul>
<p>Is $25,000 going to make a difference in this big project? <strong>YOU BET!!</strong> Most of this project has been financed with a combination of a first mortgage and Community Bond social impact financing of over $700,000. We've also been fortunate with some capital and project grants, as well as individual and corporate sponsorships, which we will announce at the opening. <strong>Your support in this last leg of the campaign will make a HUGE difference. </strong>We are building community with - and in - community. </p>

<h3>Why Now?</h3>
<p>10 Carden is ready and Guelph is also rapidly changing. Over the past 3 years, there has been a dramatic increase in the development of our downtown and several not-for-profit and social benefit organizations have already been displaced from the core of our city. Over the long-term, this may drastically change the quality and character of our city as a whole.</p>
<h3>COMMUNITY INVESTMENT TO REALIZE A LONG-TERM HOME FOR 10 CARDEN AS A SOCIAL INNOVATION HUB IS ONE WAY TO ENSURE THAT AN ACCESSIBLE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT SPACE REMAINS IN OUR DOWNTOWN - AVAILABLE TO ALL.</h3>
<p>In addition to activating 4 floors plus the basement area, this project also offers the <strong>full top floor to large scale 180+ person arts, cultural and educational event activities,</strong> including the first Downtown Guelph <strong>Community Classroom</strong> in concert with the <strong>University of Guelph, Community Engaged Scholarship Institute</strong> and <strong>Student Life departments</strong>. The future of learning, collaboration and changemaking is here. </p>

We welcome groups and individuals into an inclusive community of social change organizations working across sectors and engaging in collaborative work. Our tangible offering is affordable downtown co-working and event meeting space. Our immeasurable benefits extend to inclusion, connection, collaboration, creativity, and developing new ways of solving social challenges. 
People work, meet, eat, create, connect and brainstorm together at 10C. 
10 Carden is in its 8th year and is expanding - and this growth is being realized through the redevelopment of a historic landmark in the core of our city, the former Acker's Furniture building, located at 42 Carden Street. The project is being undertaken by 10 Carden and Chalmers Community Services Centre as the property owners and core building tenants, and together, will activate the entire building.
In early 2017, we will open this fully accessible 15,000 square feet location. Help 10 Carden finish this community space! 

10C is making space for community connections that foster: collaborations, new ideas, professional and social networks that build urban integration, resilience and establish the scaffolding for Guelph residents to work on complex issues together. All of these are important as Guelph (and other cities) grow in population due to provincial mandating and as challenges of urban living become more complex (i.e. water supply, energy costs, access to civic space, diversity, direct democracy and social inclusion). 10C helps people form connections and collaborate.
Support through this campaign will help finish the main floor and the second floor community gathering spaces. 


Save the Date - we are planning an amazing community party on April 29, 2016.

Our goal is to raise $25,000 through this campaign. This will help with key finishing work required on the most active spaces on the main and second floors.




The first $10,000 raised through this campaign will finish the Carden Street Gallery-Lounge, which will become an active gathering space and act as the main entrance to 10C. This area needs new flooring and finishing carpentry, including reinstallation of tin ceiling to welcome visitors into the space. 

The next $8,000 raised will help to refinish the warehouse floor, and add lighting, seating and furnishings on the 2nd floor Sunroom and Library area. This sunny spot will be a key area for people to meet, read, research and brainstorm. This is also the future home of the Out on the Shelf Library, Guelph's LGTBQ+ community resource centre. Hundreds of people will gather here weekly to soak up the sun and enjoy the views of Market Square. Join friends new and old in the space and be part of the action!  

The next $5000 raised will also help build and finish the gender-neutral barrier-free bathroom on the second floor. As noted, the building is full of practical and accessible features and our bathrooms are going to rock!  
Finally, any direct funds raised for the Acker's Sign Restoration will go towards the restoration of the large Acker's Furniture sign, which graced Carden Street from 1956 to 2016. The sign is currently in storage with Signs Galore in Breslau, awaiting its glorious return. 


What you get in return...

Fun Perks Include: Stickers! T-Shirts! Photo Portraits! Get your name memorialized! This is your chance to join in the adventure and be part of this transformation of this landmark space. The opening party - one of our key perks will be a blast! Bring a friend or bring 10. With over 200 people coming to our bare-bones construction site opening in spring 2016, we are expecting a full-house!

What if you don't reach your campaign goal? Well, if we don't reach our goal, we will focus on the main floor space and complete as much of the work as possible. But, we really hope that you can help us reach the goal, and have created perks to provide you value, connection and enjoyment. 
And if we exceed our goal, then we will continue to add magic to the 3rd and 4th floors!

Is $25,000 going to make a difference in this big project? YOU BET!! Most of this project has been financed with a combination of a first mortgage and Community Bond social impact financing of over $700,000. We've also been fortunate with some capital and project grants, as well as individual and corporate sponsorships, which we will announce at the opening. Your support in this last leg of the campaign will make a HUGE difference. We are building community with - and in - community. 

Why Now?
10 Carden is ready and Guelph is also rapidly changing. Over the past 3 years, there has been a dramatic increase in the development of our downtown and several not-for-profit and social benefit organizations have already been displaced from the core of our city. Over the long-term, this may drastically change the quality and character of our city as a whole.
COMMUNITY INVESTMENT TO REALIZE A LONG-TERM HOME FOR 10 CARDEN AS A SOCIAL INNOVATION HUB IS ONE WAY TO ENSURE THAT AN ACCESSIBLE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT SPACE REMAINS IN OUR DOWNTOWN - AVAILABLE TO ALL.
In addition to activating 4 floors plus the basement area, this project also offers the full top floor to large scale 180+ person arts, cultural and educational event activities, including the first Downtown Guelph Community Classroom in concert with the University of Guelph, Community Engaged Scholarship Institute and Student Life departments. The future of learning, collaboration and changemaking is here. 
This project brings together several social benefit organizations:

Chalmers Community Services Centre
University of Guelph, College of Social and Applied Human Sciences - Community Engaged Scholarship Institute
University of Guelph, Student Life
Guelph-Wellington Local Immigration Partnership
Out on the Shelf LGTBQ+ Library
Guelph Arts Council
Guelph Neighbourhood Support Coalition
Wellington Water Watchers
Taylor Newberry Consulting
Guelph Dance
Community Justice Initiatives
Main Power Corp.
Transformative Arts, and others underway.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Filipa Carreira, I am the founder of Wamina, a Mozambican social enterprise that disseminates information on the period and menstrual hygiene as well as access to affordable reusable menstrual pads for low income and vulnerable girls. My team includes Maura Couto, who is responsible for marketing e communications, and Mariana Lima, who is responsible for community outreach and public relations.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We want to raise 2000 USD to finance our awareness and marketing campaign to promote Wamina Pads,  an innovative and affordable menstrual product for low income and vulnerable girls in Mozambique. If we do not reach our goal of 2000 USD we will use the money to buy Wamina Pads and distribute them among vulnerable girls in orphanages.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The reason why you should get involved in this project is that in Africa 1 in 10 girls drops out of school because they cannot afford menstrual hygiene products. By disseminating information of the period through Wamina booklets and workshops and making Wamina pads affordable we aim to reduce this statistic and by donating to this campaign you will be doing the same. Your donation will allow girls to manage their periods hygienically and with dignity. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge is to introduce the Wamina Pads in the market since it is an old concept adapted to the social, economic context of our target audience regarding such a taboo and sensitive subject such as the period. However, our team of experienced activists are skilled communicators and promotors are able to reach both our target audience (the girls) and our secondary audience (the parents) efficiently.  </p>

<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>We are Kim and Lylette Russell of Crayfish Bay Organic Estate, Grenada, a small family farm which produces cocoa, and has recently started to produce a single estate, tree to bar organic chocolate.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478517747/gdpmf0w8clhj3useojbp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We run our farm based on a fair share ethos whereby those who work on the farm earn 90% of the value of the wet cocoa they pick. They also have the option of planting as much yearly crops on the land as they wish, whether for selling or for personal use.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478473254/k3mmygpslf3lx3wovqlt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>New Micro Chocolate Factory </h3>
<p>With the help of friends and many hours of hard work we have recently completed a micro chocolate factory, mostly fitted out with self made equipment and machinery created mainly from recycled materials.</p>
<p>Our aim is to produce a high quality organic tree to bar dark chocolate made from 75% organic cocoa solids and 25% organic sugar.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478473753/j8ebho5iplefjacdemqa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>After one month of chocolate production we have come to realize that our choice of chocolate grinders was not suited to producing even small commercial quantities of chocolate. Within a four week period we began to see excessive ware and tear on most of the grinders and could only conclude that with such rapid deterioration taking place we would be unable to continue producing chocolate.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478477719/zwtd26i4axmlowsqfysa.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Since our project has been self funded and most of the construction done by ourselves we have exhausted our investment budget and now find that we are lacking the finance needed to purchase a grinder that is more suitable to our production needs.</p>
<p>We reached out to friends via our Facebook page asking for assistance and many of them showed a willingness to assist but suggested that we set up a crowd funding campaign and so here we are.</p>
<p>At present there is no way for us to continue producing chocolate and our micro factory will have to shut down within weeks, possibly days. This is why we are seeking assistance so that we can raise the funding to purchase a new and much more efficient chocolate grinder.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>The Crayfish Bay Vision</h2>
<p>With the success of our micro factory we can realize our goals of providing well paid employment for members of our village and community and producing a high quality tree to bar chocolate based on ethical farming and production processes.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478482191/odlw9hp2rv7pbxqnl7fu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<h3>What we are asking for and what you get in return for your generosity</h3>
<p>We need $14,000.00 to acquire a replacement grinder. This grinder is manufactured by Cocoatown of the USA.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478374568/v0qf1d1pc3f4phwnxire.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The cost of the machine is $10,000.00, the other $4,000.00 is to cover shipping costs and customs duties. </p>
<p>This grinder would replace the present small table model grinders we have been using which have proven inefficient for producing chocolate in commercial quantities.</p>
<p>In return for your donation you can either receive bars of chocolate or we will plant cocoa trees in your name as a reminder to us of you generosity at a time when we most needed it.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478482950/yirepgsisx4bifdielxk.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>If the funds gathered do not reach the entire goal we hope to find other means of raising the balance and the entire amount will be used for purchasing the much needed grinder.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>With Collective Effort Everyone Benefits </h3>
<div>The value of the project to you the contributor and to the world, is more indirect than direct. If enough people help to promote the production of organic food and fair pay for those at the bottom of the financial ladder, they are taking one tiny step in improving the quality of life for everyone and for future generations on this planet which we as a species depend upon entirely for our survival.</div>
<div> </div>
<p>Crayfish Bay chocolate is part of a series of projects which started ten years ago with the recovery of the totally abandoned and rundown cocoa lands in a rural area of Grenada and continued with replanting and sympathetically rebuilding the derelict 19th century farm buildings.</p>
<p>This was all done with a great deal of help and commitment from people in the community. Many of these employees have become good friends and Crayfish Bay is bringing a light into the village which ten years ago was rated as one of the poorest in Grenada. </p>
<p>Crayfish Bay cocoa and chocolate is also certified organic by CERES which allow us to demand premium price for our wet cocoa. This in effect allow those who work on the farm to earn a better living wage since they are as mentioned before paid 90% of the price of the wet cocoa.</p>

</div></div>","Our Story
We are Kim and Lylette Russell of Crayfish Bay Organic Estate, Grenada, a small family farm which produces cocoa, and has recently started to produce a single estate, tree to bar organic chocolate.

We run our farm based on a fair share ethos whereby those who work on the farm earn 90% of the value of the wet cocoa they pick. They also have the option of planting as much yearly crops on the land as they wish, whether for selling or for personal use.

 
New Micro Chocolate Factory 
With the help of friends and many hours of hard work we have recently completed a micro chocolate factory, mostly fitted out with self made equipment and machinery created mainly from recycled materials.
Our aim is to produce a high quality organic tree to bar dark chocolate made from 75% organic cocoa solids and 25% organic sugar.

After one month of chocolate production we have come to realize that our choice of chocolate grinders was not suited to producing even small commercial quantities of chocolate. Within a four week period we began to see excessive ware and tear on most of the grinders and could only conclude that with such rapid deterioration taking place we would be unable to continue producing chocolate.

Since our project has been self funded and most of the construction done by ourselves we have exhausted our investment budget and now find that we are lacking the finance needed to purchase a grinder that is more suitable to our production needs.
We reached out to friends via our Facebook page asking for assistance and many of them showed a willingness to assist but suggested that we set up a crowd funding campaign and so here we are.
At present there is no way for us to continue producing chocolate and our micro factory will have to shut down within weeks, possibly days. This is why we are seeking assistance so that we can raise the funding to purchase a new and much more efficient chocolate grinder.
 
The Crayfish Bay Vision
With the success of our micro factory we can realize our goals of providing well paid employment for members of our village and community and producing a high quality tree to bar chocolate based on ethical farming and production processes.

What we are asking for and what you get in return for your generosity
We need $14,000.00 to acquire a replacement grinder. This grinder is manufactured by Cocoatown of the USA.

The cost of the machine is $10,000.00, the other $4,000.00 is to cover shipping costs and customs duties. 
This grinder would replace the present small table model grinders we have been using which have proven inefficient for producing chocolate in commercial quantities.
In return for your donation you can either receive bars of chocolate or we will plant cocoa trees in your name as a reminder to us of you generosity at a time when we most needed it.

If the funds gathered do not reach the entire goal we hope to find other means of raising the balance and the entire amount will be used for purchasing the much needed grinder.
 
With Collective Effort Everyone Benefits 
The value of the project to you the contributor and to the world, is more indirect than direct. If enough people help to promote the production of organic food and fair pay for those at the bottom of the financial ladder, they are taking one tiny step in improving the quality of life for everyone and for future generations on this planet which we as a species depend upon entirely for our survival.
 
Crayfish Bay chocolate is part of a series of projects which started ten years ago with the recovery of the totally abandoned and rundown cocoa lands in a rural area of Grenada and continued with replanting and sympathetically rebuilding the derelict 19th century farm buildings.
This was all done with a great deal of help and commitment from people in the community. Many of these employees have become good friends and Crayfish Bay is bringing a light into the village which ten years ago was rated as one of the poorest in Grenada. 
Crayfish Bay cocoa and chocolate is also certified organic by CERES which allow us to demand premium price for our wet cocoa. This in effect allow those who work on the farm to earn a better living wage since they are as mentioned before paid 90% of the price of the wet cocoa.

 
Risks & Challenges

You, the donor may be asking yourselves about the risk and obstacles that we may face and how we intend to deal with these.
We see only two major risks the first is crop failure this could be due to disease or damage to the crop. Diseases and parasites in cocoa are few, and with a diligent crew, which we have, are easy to avoid with constant maintenance.  
Damage to the crop could occur from hurricane which we are insured against. The cocoa plant is amazingly resilient and within a space of about two years would be producing again. This has been proven by previous hurricanes.
