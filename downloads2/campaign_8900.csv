(He's the one on the left in the stripey shirt)
Fred is a friend and the librarian at the Ugandan Arts Trust (where I work). He's an extraordinary man. 
Fred was born in a small village in Uganda, with polio. No one was aware of how to treat Fred's illness and one day Fred woke up and couldn't walk.  His legs had wasted away.  
This never stopped Fred from growing: mentally, physically and artistically. 
Despite the odds of poverty and disability, Fred travelled to Kampala, Uganda's capital, and worked his way up through the education chain to complete a Degree in Fine Art at East Africa's most prestigious establishment, Makerere University.
I don't know either how he managed it, but he did.


How I met Fred...






Upon graduating and on hearing about our organisation Fred organised himself a funded internship with us.  
The day he walked through my office was pretty blooming magical. Armed with two supporters from ""Handicap International"" Fred said:
""I'm going to work for you for the next three months and prove to you that you need me!""
How could we refuse.

Then Fred wanted more...



Now Fred works for us full time, earning enough money to support himself and a bit for his family back in the village.
But Fred wants (and deserves) more.
He wants to share his skills and motivation with others by running a Saturday art class teaching other disabled people art and craft skills so they can:



Make a living

Meet other pals
Get off the streets
Be proud of themselves and each other



Watch out...
If you give to this campaign, this is what you'll do:

Provide all the materials needed for Fred's Saturday Art Class for 6 months.
Provide transport costs for the participants.
Give disabled people a way to get off the streets and into work.
Give hope, enjoyment and empowerment to some incredible individuals.
Earn me as your biggest fan forever.

If you can't contribute, don't worry too much but please SHARE this campaign so we reach our goal and get Fred's art class rocking.
Thank you from the bottom of my arty heart.

My art work has been presented in several
individual and collective events and exhibitions in Canada, Brasil, United

I took part of several artistic residencies around the world in the past 8 years. 
Artistic
residencies combine art, travels and passages. They form an integral part of my artistic

place. The confederation Art Gallery invited me to present a new art project in august 2014.  I need financial aid to be able to realize this outside installation and performance.  <br/><br/><p>The project
Vagabond Blues will consist in an outdoor installation of a serie of small caravans

a random walk or path ahead) coming across as strange nomadic creatures.</p>

<p>First of all welcome! And thank you for taking the time to check out <em>Wondrous: Tales When Wishing Still Helped</em>, a series of illustrations based on captivating and imaginative folk and faerie tales from around the world.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 60px;""><img alt=""East of the Sun and West of the Moon"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/C3Yiriy.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""The White-Bear""/></p>
<p>I believe that these tales are just as important today as they’ve ever been; for they connect us with our past, ground us in the present and lift us to our future.</p>
<p>Great faerie tales always have beautiful illustrations to go along with them, ones that we stare at for hours and that have inspired the imagination of generations to dream of worlds with wicked trolls, brave princess, greedy dragons and clever tailors.</p>
<p>My goal is to create a series of 10 illustrations of folk and faerie tales that capture a bit of that wonder I had when reading them for the first time, and hopefully introduce them to a new audience.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><img alt=""Who am i?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/zgMzq9z.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: top;"" title=""Who Am I Banner""/></strong></p>
<p>My name is Anthony Wallace; I’m an illustrator living in beautiful Canada. In 2012 I won third place in the <em>Jim Henson Fraggle Rock 30th Anniversary Illustration Contest</em>.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 60px;""><img alt=""Princess Cottongrass Drawing"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/7k9Dmmi.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Princes Cottongrass""/></p>

<p>- Anthony</p></div>","First of all welcome! And thank you for taking the time to check out Wondrous: Tales When Wishing Still Helped, a series of illustrations based on captivating and imaginative folk and faerie tales from around the world.

I believe that these tales are just as important today as they’ve ever been; for they connect us with our past, ground us in the present and lift us to our future.
Great faerie tales always have beautiful illustrations to go along with them, ones that we stare at for hours and that have inspired the imagination of generations to dream of worlds with wicked trolls, brave princess, greedy dragons and clever tailors.
My goal is to create a series of 10 illustrations of folk and faerie tales that capture a bit of that wonder I had when reading them for the first time, and hopefully introduce them to a new audience.
 

My name is Anthony Wallace; I’m an illustrator living in beautiful Canada. In 2012 I won third place in the Jim Henson Fraggle Rock 30th Anniversary Illustration Contest.

I fell in love with these tales when I was given my very own book of Irish Fairy tales, I spent hours reading these stories and staring at the illustrations, looking at all the little details and secrets that the artist had put into it. I want to pass on my passion of these tales; I love great stories that steal your imagination and the great people who tell them.

<h1>About ""Pink Ribbon Calendar""</h1>
<p>‘One in 9 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime – that’s 7 women a day"" </p>
<p>""Pink Ribbon Calendar"" involves the encounter of a photographer's team and a group of women affected by breast cancer and turning the resulting artwork into a high quality, glossy 2014 calendar.</p>
<p>Our goal is to sell the calendar to increase awareness about breast cancer in Quebec and to raise funds for the Quebec Breast Cancer Foundation. In order, to get this project of the ground, we need $7,000 to cover the production costs.</p>
<h1>What's so special about this calendar?</h1>
<p>The ""Pink Ribbon Calendar"" ranges from age 18 to 70 years old and includes a variety of professional women. ALL of these women have been affected by breast cancer. </p>
<p>The calendar images are a collaborative effort between the model, make-up artist, photographer and graphic designer: </p>
<p>Each women chose to highlight their own strengths, passions and purposes in life. A team of artists then worked to capture this essence and transfer it onto the model’s pose. Finally, the photographer and graphic designer created the setting for each photo and ensured there was a flow from month to month. </p>
<p>The calendar is designed as a beautiful piece of art, each month presents a different message of hope. These messages are one of strength, determination, family, courage and more, while also being a constant reminder to women to get regular breast examinations. </p>
<p>The calendar will be launched at an exclusive event in Montreal in the first week of October. (Breast Cancer Awareness Month)</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h1>Who's behind the ""Pink Ribbon Calendar"" projet?</h1>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This project was started by Stephane Morin, a professional photographer living in Quebec. We hope that this project will not only raise funds for the QBCF, but also increase awareness about breast cancer in this country. Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and it is a detectable disease. Regular examinations &amp; mammograms can save lives.</div>

<h1>A propos du ""Calendrier Ruban Rose""</h1>
<p>«Une femme sur 9 sera diagnostiquée avec le cancer du sein dans leur vie - c'est 7 femmes par jour""</p>
<p>Le ""Calendrier Ruban Rose"" mettra en scène un groupe de femmes touchées par le cancer du sein, un photographe professionnel et son équipe. Le projet vise à produire une oeuvre de qualité artistique supérieure, en un calendrier ""Ruban Rose"" 2014.</p>
<p>La vente du calendrier visera à accroître la sensibilisation au cancer du sein au Québec et d'amasser des fonds pour la Fondation Québécoise du Cancer du Sein. Cependant, pour en couvrir les coûts de production et permettre la réalisation de ce projet, nous avons besoin d'amasser 7000$.</p>
<h1>Quelle est la particularité de ce Calendrier?</h1>
<p>Le ""Calendrier Ruban Rose"" mettra en scène des femmes professionnelles de différentes régions du Québec âgées entre 18 et 70 ans. TOUTES ces femmes sont des survivantes ou des combattantes du cancer du sein.</p>
<p>Les images du calendrier résulteront d'un effort collectif entre ces femmes, une équipe artistique, le photographe et un infographiste, afin de rendre hommage à leur courage et transmettre un message d'espoir.</p>
<p>Chacune des femmes prendra la pose de façon à mettre en évidence sa personnalité, ses forces et passions. Pour ce faire, elles seront assistées d'une équipe artistique travaillant en étroite collaboration afin d'en saisir l'essence lors de la mise en scène. Enfin, le photographe et son infographiste travailleront aux réglages finaux de chacune des images et en assureront la mise en page de mois en mois.</p>
<p>Alors que le calendrier sera conçu comme une oeuvre d'art, chaque mois sera porteur d'un message d'espoir. Les thèmes seront ceux de la force, la détermination, la famille, et le courage, tout en étant également un rappel constant pour les femmes à se soumettre à des contrôles réguliers des seins.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><strong>My</strong> name is Bob Marzewski, but everyone knows me as <em>wizzard</em>.  I have been taking art to Burning Man for the past 14 years.  I have built pieces large and small, by myself and with crews.  This is going to be my most challenging piece yet. </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><strong>For</strong> 2012, my project is the <strong><em>Mayan TRIcycle</em></strong>.  It is a human powered tread-wheel, which will advance the days on three Mayan Calendars – the Haab, the Tzolkin and the Long Count.  My ultimate goal is to help others understand how the Mayan Calendar works and to help alleviate the fears that many have that the world as we know it is going to end on December 21st when the calendar 'ends'.  I believe that the cycle is just turning over, much like the odometer in your car does. To visually show this, I am building the Mayan TRIcycle. The 260-day Tzolkin Calendar will be a 13’ tall wheel, driven/rotated by humans running inside the wheel. The 365-day Haab Calendar will be a 24’ tall wheel that the Tzolkin calendar wheel is cradled in. Together the two wheels will rotate and will advance the Long Count “Odometer”. </p>
<h3 class=""western"">Why We Are on Indiegogo</h3>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><strong>W</strong>e are on Indiegogo to raise awareness of the <em><strong>Mayan TRIcycle</strong> </em>and to have people, like you, donate to the project to help us purchase supplies and get the TRIke to Black Rock City.  We have already raised an initial $4,000. But, it is going to take another $3,000 to make it happen.  The wood alone is costing us more than $5,000 (and we have been getting it at a discounted rate!!). </p>
<p class=""western""><strong>T</strong>his is by far the most complicated and expensive art piece that I have attempted thus far.  But, I think it is going to be awesome visually, as well as fun and educational.  In order to build it, I am going to use over 100 sheets of plywood – 3/8” for the skin, 3/4” for the gears/teeth and 1 1/8” for the sides/rings; 100 - 2 x 4s; 4 – 24' beams; 40 casters; 4 deep cell batteries; night lighting; plus wind generators, paint, nuts, bolts, screws, nails, etc, etc, etc. The list goes on and on.  </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><strong>T</strong>he <em><strong>Mayan TRIcycle </strong></em>is a kenetic, interactive art piece.  Everyone in Black Rock City will have an opportunity to take a spin on the TRIke.  When you donate, you can brag to everyone that you helped build it.  And they WILL be impressed! </p>
<h3 style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">What's In It For You?</h3>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><strong>W</strong>e have some great gifts for you if you donate to our project.  All our gifts have images that are essential to the project. For all the items with the stela on them, the stela depicts the day the <em>Man</em> burns (which is also the day the TRIke burns!! How about that!!!).  If you are getting one of the pendants, the glyph is one of the glyphs from the stela.  These are LIMITED edition pendants and are not being mass produced.  If you are getting the set of 5 glyph pendants, they are the five glyphs that make up the Long-Count Calendar for the day the Man burns. </p>
<h3 style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">What Happens If We Don't Reach Our Goal</h3>
<p><strong>W</strong>e are hopeful that we will get all the funding we need.  If we don't get it all here, we will just have to find it elsewhere.  But, we would prefer to have this be our last fund-raising effort.  We really need to shift our focus to building the piece and getting it ready to take to the desert.  With your help, this will be the last of our fundraising efforts.  </p>
<h3 class=""western"">The Impact</h3>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><strong>T</strong>he Mayan TRIcycle is going to be an imposing structure that should leave an impression on those who have a chance to see it and I hope a significant fraction of them also take the time to learn a bit about the Mayan culture and complexity of their way of thinking.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><strong>I</strong>t is also valuable at Burning Man in that it is an art piece that will be set on fire and burned it to the ground on Saturday morning (look for it to burn at 2:00 am.).  Few thing burners value more than a big wood fire.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><strong>W</strong>e will have a crew at the site to clean it all up and leave the playa as clean as it was before we started to build – LNT. </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><strong>A</strong>s I stated above, this will be my 14<sup>th</sup> year to take art to Burning Man.  My past projects include:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">A Place to Stand (2003)</li>
<li style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Pagoda of Infinite Reflection (2004)</li>
<li style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Project X (2005)</li>
<li style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Intelligent Design (2006/2009)</li>
<li style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">THE END (2008)</li>
<li style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Valley of Heart's Delight (crew member of South Bay CORE project 2011). </li>
</ul><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><strong>I</strong>n 2003, I was asked to be in the documentary <em>Burning Man: Beyond Black  Rock</em> (now available on NetFlix if you want to watch it).  I was one of three artists who was featured in the film. I am the guy who had the house fire. </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><strong>I</strong>n 2000, a photo of my art piece for that year made the front page of the SF Chronicle - in color. </p>
<h3 style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Other Ways You Can Get Involved</h3>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><strong>I</strong>f you can't contribute monetarily (and even if you can) we can still use your help in other ways.  We will be needing: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Docents (people to tell riders of the TRIke about the piece) – 2 hour shift</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Safety Crew (to make sure people don't do something “special” to hurt themselves) – 3 hour shift</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Fire Perimeter Crew (to keep viewers a safe distance away from the burning piece) – 4+ hour shift the night of the burn)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Cleanup Crew (to eradicate all signs of the TRIke – clean up the Decomposed Granite that the piece is built / burned - on Saturday morning after the burn)</p>
</li>
</ul><p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><strong>W</strong>e can also use your help by sharing our project will all your friends.  Please use the Indiegogo share tools and like us on Facebook.  Tweet about us.  Blog about us.  Help us get the word out.</p>

This is by far the most complicated and expensive art piece that I have attempted thus far.  But, I think it is going to be awesome visually, as well as fun and educational.  In order to build it, I am going to use over 100 sheets of plywood – 3/8” for the skin, 3/4” for the gears/teeth and 1 1/8” for the sides/rings; 100 - 2 x 4s; 4 – 24' beams; 40 casters; 4 deep cell batteries; night lighting; plus wind generators, paint, nuts, bolts, screws, nails, etc, etc, etc. The list goes on and on.  
The Mayan TRIcycle is a kenetic, interactive art piece.  Everyone in Black Rock City will have an opportunity to take a spin on the TRIke.  When you donate, you can brag to everyone that you helped build it.  And they WILL be impressed! 
What's In It For You?
We have some great gifts for you if you donate to our project.  All our gifts have images that are essential to the project. For all the items with the stela on them, the stela depicts the day the Man burns (which is also the day the TRIke burns!! How about that!!!).  If you are getting one of the pendants, the glyph is one of the glyphs from the stela.  These are LIMITED edition pendants and are not being mass produced.  If you are getting the set of 5 glyph pendants, they are the five glyphs that make up the Long-Count Calendar for the day the Man burns. 
What Happens If We Don't Reach Our Goal
We are hopeful that we will get all the funding we need.  If we don't get it all here, we will just have to find it elsewhere.  But, we would prefer to have this be our last fund-raising effort.  We really need to shift our focus to building the piece and getting it ready to take to the desert.  With your help, this will be the last of our fundraising efforts.  
The Impact
The Mayan TRIcycle is going to be an imposing structure that should leave an impression on those who have a chance to see it and I hope a significant fraction of them also take the time to learn a bit about the Mayan culture and complexity of their way of thinking.
It is also valuable at Burning Man in that it is an art piece that will be set on fire and burned it to the ground on Saturday morning (look for it to burn at 2:00 am.).  Few thing burners value more than a big wood fire.
We will have a crew at the site to clean it all up and leave the playa as clean as it was before we started to build – LNT. 
As I stated above, this will be my 14th year to take art to Burning Man.  My past projects include:

A Place to Stand (2003)
Pagoda of Infinite Reflection (2004)
Project X (2005)
Intelligent Design (2006/2009)
THE END (2008)
Valley of Heart's Delight (crew member of South Bay CORE project 2011). 
In 2003, I was asked to be in the documentary Burning Man: Beyond Black  Rock (now available on NetFlix if you want to watch it).  I was one of three artists who was featured in the film. I am the guy who had the house fire. 
In 2000, a photo of my art piece for that year made the front page of the SF Chronicle - in color. 
Other Ways You Can Get Involved
If you can't contribute monetarily (and even if you can) we can still use your help in other ways.  We will be needing: 


Docents (people to tell riders of the TRIke about the piece) – 2 hour shift


Safety Crew (to make sure people don't do something “special” to hurt themselves) – 3 hour shift


Fire Perimeter Crew (to keep viewers a safe distance away from the burning piece) – 4+ hour shift the night of the burn)


Cleanup Crew (to eradicate all signs of the TRIke – clean up the Decomposed Granite that the piece is built / burned - on Saturday morning after the burn)

We can also use your help by sharing our project will all your friends.  Please use the Indiegogo share tools and like us on Facebook.  Tweet about us.  Blog about us.  Help us get the word out.

<p>Welcome to Pins for Swizz! We are Kodi Sershon and Willow Hayes: Proud pet-parents of Swizzle, who is (and we don't mean to brag) <i>the best dog. </i>Several months ago, Swizzle partially tore her ACL which is a ligament in her back knee. We've been doing our best to help Swizzle during this time but our vet has informed us a TPLO surgery is needed very soon and is the only way to fix the problem permanently.</p>
<p>We believe that Swizzle deserves to live her best doggy life and we want her back out there chasing balls, going on hikes, and running frantically in circles when the mood strikes her. Basically, all things she hasn't been able to do since the injury.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the TPLO procedure is expensive. Like, $5,000+ expensive! Yikes!</p>
<p>Fortunately, Swizzle is a pretty darn likeable dog and many of Swizzle's friends have asked if we're going to set up a GoFundMe so that they can contribute and help out. Since we're both visual designers, it seemed appropriate that instead of fundraising in the classic sense of bake sales or car washes we could use our unique skills to set up something a little more fun. </p>
<p><strong>This is a flexible funding campaign.</strong> That means the campaign will fund whether or not we reach our goal. We set the goal for the estimated cost of the surgery. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Pins</h3>
<p>So, here we arrive at Pins for Swizz! We've each designed an enamel pin in our own unique styles to raise money for Swizzle's surgery. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554066437/tel36jsuufxmibfjj5zl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Willow's Swizzoro pin, based on a character from Swizzle's favorite Japanese children's film. This pin is 1.25"" tall, 5 colors, with a gold finish. Hard enamel.</p>

<p>Kodi's Swizz Vibes pin, for the fashionably hip.<strong> </strong>This pin is 1.25"" tall, black on metallic silver. Hard enamel.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Logistics</h3> <p><strong>What happens if you don't meet this fundraising goal? </strong></p>
<p>We're getting this surgery either way! We still want Swizzle to live her best dog life. It's just a matter of how much debt we'll be in after.</p>
<p><strong>How much money from a pin goes to Swizzle's surgery?</strong></p>
<p>Obviously as much as possible, but it depends on how many we sell! Here are some of the production costs:</p>
<p>Producing 50 of each pin will cost $350, that's around $3 per pin at this low quantity. If we make 100 of each design that's down to $2 a pin.  Indiegogo also charges around 8% in fees for the fundraiser and to collect money from debit cards.</p>
<p>So if we sell 50 of each pin that's $1,030 in the Swizzle fund. $10.30 per pin. </p>
<p>100 of each pin? $2,340 in the Swizzle fund with each pin raising $11.70. </p>
<p><strong>Why pins? Why not just ask for money? </strong></p>
<p>Because pins are awesome, and Swizzle pins are even better! We aren't going to ask for money without giving you something in return. You get a cool pin, we get help paying for Swizzle's surgery, everyone's happy! :)</p>

Thank you all from the bottom of my heart for enjoying and supporting my creations.My mission in life is to support people in the same ways that I've been supported. This opportunity to have a shop of my own to highlight other artists and small businesses is the open door I've been hoping for. I have supported myself and kept my business afloat for 8 years. I. know its time to take a step forward, and that this is all possible with the help of friends and strangers alike who feel that art is extremely important for reasons that are obvious and reasons that can be felt easier than expressed.Risks & ChallengesAfter spending 8 years building this business on my own, the vulnerability of allowing others to contribute to its success on this level has been exhilarating. At this point, striking out in a van would force Old Crow to grow in so many ways. In addition to the growth of my business, it would help me reach and hopefully inspire/ be inspired by a wider audience. I would be challenged to further spread the love and expand the existing artistic community that Old Crow touches. Share what qualifies you to overcome these hurdles.I have put so much energy into my business that I understand the sacrifice and dedication it takes to overcome a challenge. I’ve also learned that with personal growth comes fresh creative energy that I can pour back into my designs. Stretching myself and my business to include screen printing and a mobile shop is a way to keep evolving as an artist and a business owner. Other Ways You Can HelpThe fact that you've read this far means so much to me. If you're not in a position to contribute financially, but still want to help, please share this campaign via your social media, email or text. Every little bit helps. Each time you spread the word to another person this chain gets longer and the longer the chain the more support this campaign will receive. Thank you for being here and being a part of this journey.GratitudeMajor thank you to Cat Coule for interviewing me and filming my campaign video. I'm so grateful for you, Cat.Thank you to all of the photographers who have worked with me and who have allowed me to use their brilliant work in this campaign. Mike Valenzuela, Courtney Walker, Danielle Blonkenfeld, Becka and Kaylin Amabile. Also, thank you for all of the gorgeous women who've modeled for Old Crow and are in the launch video above. Thank you to Emily Norton and Brigette Black for helping me with the writing portion of this campaign. Big shoutout to my family and friends for being so incredibly encouraging and supportive throughout this entire process.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Art For Action is an international community arts initiative, established in 2012. Through each project we outreach to diverse, marginalised communities and give them a platform for expression. We use art as a medium for raising awareness about ever increasing international humanitarian issues.


The film above was made in  Colombia in 2015. 

Mural painted in Iraq refugee camp with Syrian children 2014.  


OUR NEXT STOP IS TANZANIA! 
Spring 2016
Amongst all the African Countries, Tanzania is the most peaceful but also the  poorest. 
While we are there we will focus on raising awareness about: 
*The 500,000 street children living in Tanzania
*Health and sanitation to prevent spread of the recent cholera epidemic
*Pre and post natal care for women and children
*The barbaric limb decapitation of people with Albinism
We will be painting at least one wall for each issue, and each wall will be painted by a different group of women and children. 
Each wall will be in the most relevant site for that particular subject matter, therefore having the maximum impact for the surrounding communities.
THIS IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO BE PART OF THE FUNDING INITIATIVE FOR THIS ORIGINAL AND EFFECTIVE PROJECT.
MEET THE TEAM
The artists involved will be a combination Rose Illingworth, who is the founder of Art For Action, internationally acclaimed Cosmo Sarson from the UK, EnRisco, a graffiti artist, skater and skatepark builder who runs Skatejam.org and two artists from the well known WACHATA graffiti crew from Dar es Salaam and . The project will be photographed by Ali Dunn.
The artwork we create will leave a legacy not just in public spaces but a positive impact for the children and communities involved. 
Wall 1 & 2: We are collaborating with Art In Tanzania to produce the first stage of the project:  painting in the Tageta township and a local village. Here we will bring focus on two local medical issues: the cholera epidemic and the much neglected natal care for women and children.
While we are hosted by Art In Tanzania we will be provided translators, internship volunteers and two film makers from a local university.
Wall 3: During the second part of the project we will collaborate with Tanzania Skate Miracle to reach vulnerable children living in Dar es Salaam (the commercial capital) and painting a Street Art Mural within their own surroundings, initiated through their own voices and ideas for their future. 
Skateboarding and ART are both powerful forms of creativity and are not dependent on language. They are therefore both very successful when reaching out to the most vulnerable youth all over the world.
Wall 4: We will raise awareness about human rights violations towards albinos and the horrific limb mutilations carried out due to superstitious beliefs. 
Walls 5+ The team will paint as many walls with as many vulnerable children as possible. 
The children involved will have the opportunity of making artwork side by side talented and internationally acclaimed artists! 

Supporting workshops will consist of portraiture, photography and stencil work. 


Rose Illingworth, the founder for Art For Action, is a freelance artist with two young children who travel everywhere with her. She has been successfully running these projects since 2012 in places such as Iraq refugee camps, safe houses in Sri Lanka, slums in Colombia, schools in The Gambia, Bedouins in Mount Sinai and most recently Calais Refugee Camp. 


Augustine from Tanzania Skate Miracle says ""I  help children using skateboarding. I believe there are so many children who shall be interested to join your program and it's great idea to use art to spread messages""
The whole project will be documented throughout. The photos and films will be exhibited back in the UK along with the local Tanzanians' artwork and the portrait paintings by Rose Illingworth.


Where Are We Going?  Mixed media on canvas. 100x 60cm

 A percentage of Rose's paintings sold goes straight back to the communities we worked with via our partnership organisations.
All those involved in helping fund this project will be able to come to the exhibition showcasing our work done in Tanzania!

FUNDING. If we raise the full amount we can fulfil all our aims. 
If we do not, we will not be able to pay Tanzanian artists, we will have a minimal amount of art materials and we will have less opportunity to work with  Tanzanian marginalised communities. Also we will be unable to cover all the issues we have raised.
However, we will be travelling to Tanzania on the budget we reach, and we will work hard to do as much as possible with the funds we have raised. 
If we exceed our target  the money will go towards the costs of the exhibition to be held later in 2016.
THANK YOU FOR BEING PART OF ART FOR ACTION'S TANZANIA PROJECT!
We hope you like our perks and look forward to meeting you at the future exhibition!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><font size=""3"">The indiExhibit is an online, nonprofit artisan community that has members from across the globe. We currently find two of our members in desperate need of financial assistance.</font></p>
<p><font size=""3""><br/></font></p>
<p><font size=""3"">One of these members has been with us since we started back in 2009 with only a handful of members. She is a mother of three children and her husband has been out of work for over 6 months. They have resorted to selling their belongings to make ends meet. They are coming dangerously close to losing their home. This year will mark her children's second year without a Christmas.</font></p>
<p><font size=""3""><br/></font></p>
<p><font size=""3"">Our second member is facing a hardship of a different nature, but needs our help all the same. This lady has a number of life threatening illnesses and her darling ""fur child"", a Chihuahua named ""Pixie"", has helped her through it all. Now Pixie is very ill herself, with several tumors and possibly cancer. The vet says that she needs surgery immediately, however the surgery is $1200 and there is just no money for it.</font></p>
<p><font size=""3""><br/></font></p>
<p><font size=""3"">Since our group is more like a large global family rather than just a group of artists, our members have rallied together to help these ladies in every way that we can. Members from our group have donated their own artwork and products as 'gifts' for people who donate to help. Members of The indiExhibit are also using every social networking angle that we can to help spread the word and help our ladies in need.</font><br/></p>
<h6 class=""uiStreamMessage""><span class=""messageBody""><span class=""text_exposed_show""><br/></span></span></h6>
<p><font size=""4""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Impact</span></font></p>
</div><div>
<p><font size=""3"">The impact of this fundraiser is pretty simple. Two families are in need, families just like ours, families with children. Not only will this fundraiser bring them the financial assistance that they need, it will also help bring them encouragement and hope--something that no amount of money can ever buy.</font> <font size=""3"">Every dollar will be split 50/50 to each member, until the amount of Pixie's surgery has been funded, then every dollar will go to our other member in need.</font><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><font size=""3"">We all know that the economy is down and everyone's wallets are a bit on the light side, so our members have created gifting perks starting at just a small $5 donation--less than you would spend on your lunch at McDonald's!</font></p>

<h3>THIS PROJECT has been <span style=""font-style: italic;"">POSTPONED</span> until late this Fall or Winter, when I will have time to go for 2-3 months.  As suggested by funders, I will open a separate ""Buenos Aires Tango, Tango, Tango"" account and put the money raised here away for my return to the ""Mecca"" of tango.  <br/>
</h3>
<h3>I do still plan to do a US Book/Tango Tour (mid-April-June 2012).  Thank you for your support!<br/>
</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Since before I knew how to write, I â€œwroteâ€ stories in pink-paged notebooks.  20 years later, that passion met tango.  After taking a one-year leave from my job as an 8th Grade Language Arts (English) teacher in Seattle in 2008 to volunteer in the mountains of PerÃº and meeting tango along my travels around South America, my life changed completely.  I was compelled to write, and write I did.  After nearly 2 years of writing ""moments"" - on napkins, short one-paragraph Word Documents, poems, unsent text messages - and a chance encounter with a man who was finishing his Uruguay por el Mundo (Uruguay Around the World) trip who encouraged me to publish stories about my own travels, I realized that those pieces of writing I had been collecting were a book.  Since then, the ideas bombarded me - I could barely keep up!</p>
<p>I spent the first part of 2011 finishing my collection/writing phase, organizing, revising, and editing my thoughts and learning a great deal about what it takes to format a book, design a cover, and self-publish.  The resulting book, When 1+1=1: That ""Impossible"" Connection, is a journey through my memoir of getting know tango and myself, of learning about human interactions from my experiences on the dance floor.  </p>
<p>My goal now is to get it out there and share it with the public, to not stand in the way of the book's success.  I birthed this book and - like children - it has taken me and pushed me way outside my comfort zone.  I feel I owe it to my book to do what I can to spread the message, that life is about connecting with one another.</p>
<p>My first improvised tour took me to Europe on a leap of faith, with little more than a box of books.  Thanks to the support of gracious friends - old and new - I made my way from tango event to tango event, visiting 13 cities in 8 countries.</p>
<p>Next on my agenda to continue this work of getting my book out there, is a trip back to my ""tango home"" of Buenos Aires, the ""Mecca"" of tango, where I will reconnect with teachers, mentors, and friends who helped shape me over the last 3 years, promote my book and translate it into Spanish.  To make this happen, especially on this short funding timeline (I just heard about IndieGoGo last week), I could really use your help.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I believe that once you make art public, it's out there for people to interpret and interact with.  The responses to my book have been inspirational and that is what fuels me to keep at this work of spreading the word, spreading the idea that we all could use a hug.  Like keeping a painting in your basement, if no-one knows about it, it goes nowhere â€“ itâ€™s impact stops there.  With your help, this will not be the case and the distribution of When 1+1=1 will go far beyond the 450+ books that are out in the world now.  With your help, I will be able to expand the reach of my book to Buenos Aires and to Spanish speakers throughout the world; the impact of your contribution is limitless.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need To Make It Happen &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With your support, I will get myself and my books to Buenos Aires.  More specifically, I will:</p>
<p>- print 200 more copies<br/>
- pay shipping and customs fees<br/>
- purchase a ticket from Seattle to Buenos Aires and back, stopping through New York to plan for my U.S. Book/Tango Tour (my next project, April-June 2012)<br/></p>
<p>I greatly appreciate your support and am excited to offer some unique perks to help entice you: photos from milongas (tango events) in Buenos Aires, a postcard from Buenos Aires, exclusive excerpts from my book, autographed copies of my book, a yerba mate and empanada merienda party, and even a chance to add tango to your next party!
</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Writing the book was a big DIY (Do It Yourself) project, especially financially.  Now that it's published, Iâ€™m ready to DIWO (Do It With Others) and to ask for help.  No contribution is too small!  Your help spreading the word is a huge help, too!  Please pass the link/webpage to this project and/or to my book (<a href=""http://www.gabrielacondrea.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.gabrielacondrea.com</a>) via email, Facebook, Twitter, Biznik, Linked-In, through word of mouth, as a conversation starter, ice-breaker, fun trivia fact, and the list of possibilities goes on and on...  Thank you!   Thank you!</p>

I birthed this book and - like children - it has taken me and pushed me way outside my comfort zone.  I feel I owe it to my book to do what I can to spread the message, that life is about connecting with one another.
My first improvised tour took me to Europe on a leap of faith, with little more than a box of books.  Thanks to the support of gracious friends - old and new - I made my way from tango event to tango event, visiting 13 cities in 8 countries.
Next on my agenda to continue this work of getting my book out there, is a trip back to my ""tango home"" of Buenos Aires, the ""Mecca"" of tango, where I will reconnect with teachers, mentors, and friends who helped shape me over the last 3 years, promote my book and translate it into Spanish.  To make this happen, especially on this short funding timeline (I just heard about IndieGoGo last week), I could really use your help.


The Impact
I believe that once you make art public, it's out there for people to interpret and interact with.  The responses to my book have been inspirational and that is what fuels me to keep at this work of spreading the word, spreading the idea that we all could use a hug.  Like keeping a painting in your basement, if no-one knows about it, it goes nowhere â€“ itâ€™s impact stops there.  With your help, this will not be the case and the distribution of When 1+1=1 will go far beyond the 450+ books that are out in the world now.  With your help, I will be able to expand the reach of my book to Buenos Aires and to Spanish speakers throughout the world; the impact of your contribution is limitless.



What I Need To Make It Happen & What You Get
With your support, I will get myself and my books to Buenos Aires.  More specifically, I will:
- print 200 more copies
- pay shipping and customs fees
- purchase a ticket from Seattle to Buenos Aires and back, stopping through New York to plan for my U.S. Book/Tango Tour (my next project, April-June 2012)
I greatly appreciate your support and am excited to offer some unique perks to help entice you: photos from milongas (tango events) in Buenos Aires, a postcard from Buenos Aires, exclusive excerpts from my book, autographed copies of my book, a yerba mate and empanada merienda party, and even a chance to add tango to your next party!




Other Ways You Can Help
Writing the book was a big DIY (Do It Yourself) project, especially financially.  Now that it's published, Iâ€™m ready to DIWO (Do It With Others) and to ask for help.  No contribution is too small!  Your help spreading the word is a huge help, too!  Please pass the link/webpage to this project and/or to my book (www.gabrielacondrea.com) via email, Facebook, Twitter, Biznik, Linked-In, through word of mouth, as a conversation starter, ice-breaker, fun trivia fact, and the list of possibilities goes on and on...

<h3>THIS IS A FIXED FUNDED GOAL - IF THIS CAMPAIGN DOES NOT MAKE ITS GOAL, YOU GET YOUR MONEY BACK!</h3>
<p>My name is Albert and I'm an artist.  When I was young, all I wanted to do was draw comicbooks.  During college I got that chance, but I worked on books that weren't my own.  In those days before computers and the internet boomed, aspiring comicbook artists looking to make a living were stuck doing other people's stories and books.</p>
<p>Now there's the internet, and imaging software, and digital DRAWING TOOLS! Now is an opportunity to draw and tell stories that I've always wanted to tell with an open and free distribution network that is the internet. All I need is the Intuos 5 Pen Tablet (<a href=""http://www.wacom.com/en/products/intuos.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.wacom.com/en/products/intuos.aspx</a>)  I'm a capable artist and I've used an Intuos before though not my own.  It allows me to draw digitally as if I were using traditional pen and ink.</p>
<p>I'm passionate about art and helping other artists.  The Intuos 5 will help me  communicate in the best way I know how...visually!</p>
<p> </p>

<p>I need $500 to purchase the Intuos5.  The actual cost is about $442 on Amazon at the moment but with Indiegogo fees the total cost brings it up to $500.  As I stated earlier, this is a FIXED FUNDED campaign.  So it's all or nothing, if I don't achieve my goal then you get your money back!</p>
<p>If I achieve my goal, the Intuos 5 will be my single <em>most cherished art tool</em>!  I would be so ECSTATIC to create art everyday!  If by chance I achieve MORE than my goal, I can either give you your money back or deliver on the appropriate perk you contributed through or reinvest that money into other Indiegogo projects that support art.  </p>
<p>To all my campaign contributors you will be the recipient of the following perks (all of which will be created using the Intuos 5 pen tablet):</p>
<ul>
<li>$1 - UNIQUE SKETCH JUST FOR YOU! - This will be a digital line drawing.  The subject matter will be up to my discretion but if you leave a note with your contribution, I may do something with it.  The final product will be like a surprise ;)<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>$10 - BASIC CARICATURE - This will be a black and white digital drawing of any one person of your choosing.  I can work off photographs.  (SIDENOTE: I was a caricature artist at Disney World and Disney World Resorts for 8 years, 1998-2006)<br/><br/>

<p>One rainy afternoon, a few weeks into my trip, on a mountain in Livingstonia, I was moved to craft a little stuffed zebra doll for a 9 year-old orphaned girl I'd met named Witty.  I was haunted by Witty because she’d seemed so devastatingly sad and lonely.<span class=""style_5""> </span>As I hand-stitched her name onto my little zebra creation, I realized I was infusing it with all the love and compassion I felt for her and all the other vulnerable women and children I'd met along the way.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Our vision is to manifest a creative movement arts studio where we can teach various forms of therapuetic self expression using circus, improv dance, yoga and the flow arts as our platform. We also intend to create a homebase for the circus and performance art community in Raleigh where currently there is none. We believe these art forms are beautiful, empowering, and healing. Cirque de Vol Studios will provide a safe community atmosphere for folks from all walks of life to explore themselves, heal themselves, and express themselves through these art forms.</p>
<p>Our intention to create a home for dancers, movers, shakers and lovers of all forms of creative expression needs your help in getting our doors open.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>These funds are needed to help with basic construction needs, aerial rigging, safety mats and flooring needed to operate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A portion of the money raised in this campagin is allotted towards sending local at-risk youth to our Kid's Circus Summer Camps.</p>
<p>About Sara Phoenix, creator of Cirque de Vol Studios-</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The type of impact Cirque de Vol Studios will have on our community is much needed. We plan to provide a new alternative to the community to express themselves creatively while cultivating healthy living skills. Circus arts help to improve both mental and physical health. Cirque de Vol Studios will be a place where folks can gather and support one another-it will be an awesome alternative to the gym, the bar or the playground that is completely new.We want to enchant our community by providing them with a chance to break free from stagnant routines with a fresh and unique new environment in which they can grow and interact with others through fitness, performance and play.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At Cirque de Vol, we recognize that the only way we can change the world is by first changing ourselves. We live to make life less difficult for each other. We live to create, and through our shared creative efforts, find communion and our home in the place of things. We recognize the interconnectedness of all beings and the important practice of empowering and inspiring eachother.</p>

Cirque de Vol Studios will be a place where folks can gather and support one another-it will be an awesome alternative to the gym, the bar or the playground that is completely new.We want to enchant our community by providing them with a chance to break free from stagnant routines with a fresh and unique new environment in which they can grow and interact with others through fitness, performance and play.
 
At Cirque de Vol, we recognize that the only way we can change the world is by first changing ourselves. We live to make life less difficult for each other. We live to create, and through our shared creative efforts, find communion and our home in the place of things. We recognize the interconnectedness of all beings and the important practice of empowering and inspiring eachother.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>“How can there be light that throws no shadows? There is no good that is not opposed by evil” – C.G. Jung<br/><br/>A shadow resides in each of us. Inspired by the work of psychologist and psychoanalyst, C.G. Jung, we explore the Shadow archetype through physical movement. Jung describes the “Shadow self” as something that consists of the negative expressions we avoid revealing others, and at times, ourselves. What we show the world, our Ego, is afraid of the capabilities of our Shadow and therefore suppresses it, ignoring that it is essential to who we are. Using dance as our medium, we invite what is buried to surface and compliment our light.</p>

August tends to roll around a lot quicker than expected. It never seems I have enough time in a year to prepare for these months.

 capturing performances. I spend months prior to August coming up with unique innovative show concepts/ideas and I invest in better equipment. After all it's <i>the </i>month where a lot of my creative energy

</h3><p></p><p></p><p><font class=""Apple-style-span"">The idea for Alchemy Art Labs was born from Lauryl's desire to create a space in her community for artists who need support accessing affordable space outside of their own home, and an environment that will cultivate connections between artists in order for them to collaborate, develop skills and support each other through the professional artistic process. Alchemy Art Labs grew from there with the mission to support, educate, and enrich all humans through the arts. One of the ways Alchemy Art Labs plans to do this is to provide studio, gallery, retail, and educational space to the artist community and beyond. Artists, teachers, and students involved with the community will find new and creative solutions to the financial, logistical and emotional boundaries that come with being an artist. Alchemy Art Labs will also offer an inclusive and supportive environment for community members who do not necessarily consider themselves artistic but want to explore their creativity in a safe and group-oriented space. Alchemy Art Labs believes that every human is at the effect of creative impulses. By creating the space for creativity to flourish and feed, all humans will thrive in our community.  If you'd like more information about our business, scroll down!  </font></p><p><font class=""Apple-style-span""></font></p><p><font class=""Apple-style-span""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/378393/files/20140218131644-lauryl_shelly_meetup.jpg?1392758204"" src="""" style=""""/></font></p><font class=""Apple-style-span"">

The idea for Alchemy Art Labs was born from Lauryl's desire to create a space in her community for artists who need support accessing affordable space outside of their own home, and an environment that will cultivate connections between artists in order for them to collaborate, develop skills and support each other through the professional artistic process. Alchemy Art Labs grew from there with the mission to support, educate, and enrich all humans through the arts. One of the ways Alchemy Art Labs plans to do this is to provide studio, gallery, retail, and educational space to the artist community and beyond. Artists, teachers, and students involved with the community will find new and creative solutions to the financial, logistical and emotional boundaries that come with being an artist. Alchemy Art Labs will also offer an inclusive and supportive environment for community members who do not necessarily consider themselves artistic but want to explore their creativity in a safe and group-oriented space. Alchemy Art Labs believes that every human is at the effect of creative impulses. By creating the space for creativity to flourish and feed, all humans will thrive in our community.  If you'd like more information about our business, scroll down!  
In order to successfully open Alchemy Art Labs we are hoping to raise all of the money for the initial costs of the business, as we are starting from nothing. This is asking a lot from the community, but we believe that the benefit of a community art space that is affordable and accessible to all will be well worth the investment.  Our Indiegogo campaign will cover our startup costs, but our first priority will be our space.  The startup costs include rent, deposit, and utilities for our new space, as well as the buildout of tenant improvements.  We need services from many local professionals, including legal, financial, and tradespersons, which will be funded by donations, as well as ld industries.  We also need a myriad of supplies and materials in order to start offering the services we are planning to provide.   Alchemy Art Labs is committed to re-using, re-cycling, up-cycling, and buying second hand, everything that we can.  With an endeavor of this scale, we will need every bit of the campaign donations as well.   With space and materials available, we can very quickly gain financial self sufficiency.Check out our fabulous perks, inspired by our passion for education, art journaling, and handmade goods!  Hey, we know that not everyone can donate financially.  If you'd like to contribute services, time, or materials, please let us know!   Contact us at alchemyartlabs@gmail.com

<p></p></div>","And I'd like for you to be part of the team making the next big leap into the world of listening to music, movies and playing video games in 5.1.This is my invitation to one and all to come aboard for a most exciting adventure. I need your help to promote my recently Patented miniature 5.1 surround sound listening system of loudspeaker placement.First, if I reach my goal, I'll be showing it at America's largest Inventors Trade show, INPEX (Invention And New product Exposition) in June at Pittsburgh's David L. Lawrence Convention Center.AFTER WAITING ALMOST FOUR YEARSI FINALLY GOT MY PATENTMy Patent is based on my startling discovery that little loudspeakers can soundthe same at a few INCHES away, as they do at a few FEET away.Hundreds of the biggest and best companies in the US will be at the Inpex Show, scouting to find, and take on new and unique inventions either by buying a patent outright or licensing to manufacture and sell. I will consider all ways.You probably know that the costs for exhibiting in a high class trade show like this one can be very  high, and individuals, as well as companies, spend thousands to put their best foot forward.Soon after the show, I'll introduce and demonstrate the invention to fellow recording engineers and mixers, audio enthusiasts, and speaker companies in Philadelphia, New York and Nashville. I'll also be inviting the press.I've included the budget down below, and if we exceed that amount, I'll just keep plugging away, and show in more places like Chicago and L.A., and maybe more, and try to get on national TV. And if we go way over, I might even consider starting a company to make and distribute the platforms. If you make a pledge of any amount, you'll be invited to one of the showings, and you can bring your favorite video game, music or movies to try it out, or just bring yourself. We'll mount an extensive press campaign to all the trades with our 600 word releases also going to at least 100,000 journalists, twice.I must put my best foot forward, but I can't do it without YOUR help.


This is John Fox, enjoying playing a video game with my Miniature Loudspeaker Placement Platform.It also means lower cost
equipment, including the amplifiers and the little speakers, and no need for expensive
room treatment. The much lower volume levels mean that the power output needed is a fraction of what is needed
in a full size sound treated room.
So, how did all of this come about?I got the idea a few years ago when I was
shooting my miniatures. I'm also a miniature craftsman and have
made little working chandeliers, some of which are in museums.
This one
is hanging in the Ron Hubble ""Solon"" in the Taiwan Miniature MuseumI was writing my book, The Fine Art of Photographing Miniatures, especially chandeliers and rooms, and how to
make them look like they're real and FULL size, like this one. I was setting up the lighting and the camera to shoot this room my wife had built. The cross bars in the photo show the camera positioning at eye level.Note that the camera is only inches away at that established eye level of about four inches (four feet) off the floorSeeing as how the furniture and chandelier looked so real at only a few inches away, I wondered how little SPEAKERS might sound from inches away. So, I went to work experimenting, and my research revealed that the intensity of sound levels drops off in inches just like it does in feet, and in the same proportions. Acting the same as light does in its intensity, they both follow the Inverse Square Law. The Patent Examiners, after intensive searching ""prior art"" Patents, found that no one had ever come up with this idea and after four years, issued my Patent. 
Thus, the newly Patented Miniaturized Loudspeaker Placement Platform
NOW IT CAN BE ""MINI-FIELD"" INSTEAD OF ""NEAR-FIELD"" - AND ONLY INCHES AWAY
So, a movie, music or a game addict, and even
we STUDIO engineers, can crank it up at 3 AM, and not bother the neighbors. But
now, I really need you to make a PLEDGE.


It was hard to come up with perks
and incentives related to my invention, so, I decided to offer some of the finest dining places in the country and some famous jazz,
country, classical, and Irish music places as perks and here's a few:

New York's

Philly's Old Ship Moshulu RestaurantGrand Ole Opry ororOOh! does that look good! oror

or

The Gold and Platinum (perks) are similar to my real ones that you see here.Here's a photo of some of my prototypes from a brochure
And especially my favorite prototype I am using in my studio. 
I LOVE MY LITTLE STUDIO WHERE I CAN DO ALMOST ANYTHING. AND THERE'S MY  ""MINI-FIELD,"" LF, C, RF, LR, AND RR.
& Logic Pro X
But now, I really need you to make a pledge, and every dollar counts.Our goal is $15,275, and my hopes are high that we reach it, and even go beyond. And if we do, rest assured that I will seek all means to promote the invention, with lots of publicity and continued plugging away. Who knows? If we go way over our goal, we might even start our own company making them from the prototypes shown, and find a distributor, and also license it.
With Indiegogo crowd-funding, if you don't
reach your goal, unlike other crowd-funders, you will still get whatever the
amount is. But we really need that amount to put it over right. So please look
over the proposed budget.

<p><strong>Heels on Wheels: Keep the Glitter Sparkling!</strong></p>
<p> For 2013, we are looking to crowd source $5,000 towards our organization's sustainability.</p>
<p> Heels on Wheels is a group of interdisciplinary performing artists and event producers who create fabulous and inclusive performance-based cultural works and community events that are produced from sites of femme/inine-positive queer embodiment. </p>
<p><strong>Heels on Wheels emerges from an active anti-oppression, intersectional, radical queer, feminist and liberatory standpoint boldly asserting: art can change our world. </strong></p>
<p> As event organizers we've created space for over 150 artists to share their stories, their truths, and their creativity live in front of amazing audiences. We've gathered 200 people at four different community conversations, and 100 at workshops. We've entertained, inspired, and educated over 2,000 folks across Canada and the continental U.S. at shows that are always financially accessible and often all-ages. </p>
<p> Heels on Wheels produces an annual Glitter Roadshow tour, a monthly Opentoe Peepshow revealing new works by queer artists, a Cabaret to End Patriarchy, and one-offs that have included the epic events Beyond Visibility, and Mixploratorium, and more.  </p>
<p> Our shows, events, and dialogues reveal the power in our under-represented communities by including local acts, facilitating discussions on activist art, and touring social justice and anti-oppressive cultural works.By actively complicating what it looks like, sounds like, and IS like to shamelessly and lovingly  represent femininity, dandyness, fey, femme and queer lady, this work confronts misogyny and sexism and<strong> uses cultural works to sabotage the status quo of gender, sexuality, and “feminine” appearance, replacing it with many visions and ideas of what thriving and surviving as femme folks can be. </strong></p>
<p><strong>WHY YOU SHOULD RAIN SOME GLITTER ON US!!</strong></p>
<p>We've been working together for almost four years and are currently building our organization's infrastructure so we can work together more democratically, sustain our cultural work, and include more people in the core organizing, curating, and producing group. </p>
<p> For this -- we need seed money! To start a business bank account, to apply for grants, and to combat income inequality by paying honorariums so more people can work with us. </p>
<p> As a working-class and poor people-led organization, we know that taking time off work without pay is not always an option, and we don't want that reality to keep any femme who wants to work with Heels on Wheels out, so some of this money will go towards income reimbursement for touring artists.</p>
<p> Lastly, we plan to hold a visioning retreat in Summer 2013, and want to make it financially accessible for everyone who wants to attend to do so. </p>
<p> Our events are mostly volunteer-run, and the money we do make goes to space rental [not cheap in NYC!], paying artists too-small honorariums, and a $25/week practice space the Heels on Wheels core folks share. For tour, using a feminist model that all labor is equally valuable, we pay artists and staff the same wage. This equalled, considering all the time on tour [10 hours a day]: $1/hour for the first tour, and $2/hour for the next two tours. The tour organizing is paid at about $0.50-$1/hour. Heels on Wheels is a labor of love that we want to continue, and to do so we want to invite more people in, and be able to provide more sustainable honorariums to them.</p>
<p><strong>MORE ABOUT OUR SPARKLE</strong></p>
<p>The people presenting art onstage and community organizing in their home city of Brooklyn all build power for traditionally-marginalized LGBTQ stories and people. Heels on Wheels is working class-led and multi-racial, and includes and showcases cisgendered and trans folks, QPOC, mixed race, and white folks, sex workers, immigrants, survivors, and more: all fiercely political feminist queer artists whose work weaves punk herstories, survival strategies, and wild costuming into escape artistry. <strong>These are stories that do not have enough outlets on a regular basis and that's one reason this tour is important!</strong></p>
<p>“The Heels on Wheels Roadshow is a glorious campaign to put femininity in the spotlight. I totally applaud and approve. It is a delicious combination touring glitterati and local sparkle that showcases some serious queer talent. Don’t let them pass you by!”</p>

During my years of practice though, there has always been something missing for me. It was one event in May of last year that finally shed light on what that was. </p><p>In Union Square, Manhattan last May, I rolled out a huge canvas on the pavement with some paints and brushes, and asked passers by to join in in helping me fill it with colour. The day that followed was the most beautiful display of human connection and expression I have ever witnessed, and brought me the most happiness of anything I have ever done.</p><p>People from all walks of life dropped what they were doing and sat with me for 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 2 hours, and not only contributed to a vibrant and living artwork that grew and morphed throughout the day, but opened up to me and each other about their lives, their passions and their worries, their plans for the day, the poem they had written for their girlfriend, how their mum was pissed off with them because of this or that. Connecting with someone next to them that on the subway would not have recieved a smile. </p><p>It struck me then, that this was what I wanted as an artist. I want to be the vehicle that cracks through those walls, that breaks the fear of creation and expression that the vast majority of society has. To create an opportunity for the beauty and positivity of collaborating and connecting with your fellow man or woman, boy or girl for the pure sake of enjoyment in a passing moment, to be seen and to be appreciated as a fundamentally human concept that has been somewhat squashed in our busy, modern world.</p><p><b>CollaboNation at Burning Man Festival, Black Rock Desert, Navada</b></p><p><b><a href=""http://www.burningman.com/whatisburningman/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.burningman.com/whatisburningman/</a></b><br/></p><p></p><p><i>""Mission Statement..</i></p><p><i>Our mission is to produce the annual event known as ""Burning Man"" and to guide, nurture and protect the more permanent community created by its culture. Our intention is to generate society that connects each individual to his or her creative powers, to participation in community, to the larger realm of civic life, and to the even greater world of nature that exists beyond society. We believe that the experience of Burning Man can produce positive spiritual change in the world. To this end, it is equally important that we communicate with one another, with the citizens of Black Rock City and with the community of Burning Man wherever it may arise. Burning Man is radically inclusive, and its meaning is potentially accessible to anyone. The touchstone of value in our culture will always be immediacy: experience before theory, moral relationships before politics, survival before services, roles before jobs, embodied ritual before symbolism, work before vested interest, participant support before sponsorship. Finally, in order to accomplish these ends, Burning Man must endure as a self-supporting enterprise that is capable of sustaining the lives of those who dedicate themselves to its work. From this devotion spring those duties that we owe to one another. We will always burn the Man. ""</i></p><p>Not only does CollaboNation's values and intentions resonate harmoniously with those of Burning Man, but it is a temporary, transient society that assembles from all across the world in a collaborative and self reliant epicentre of conscious human celebration. </p>The artwork that we create at Burning Man will be a collaboration between you guys, the funding contributors, from different places across the globe, and those at burning man that have travelled from all across the world to the Black Rock Desert - collaboratively funded, collaboratively created, and collaboratively experienced. Each contributor taking that seed back to their homes and effectively spreading it across the world.<p></p><p>In the transient spirit of Burning Man, at the end of the festival and upon completion of the artwork, when all contributors have expressed and released what they needed to, the piece will be cremated and ashes savoured as a token of the moment in time when all of us crossed paths and gave our piece.</p><p>As contributors you are a fundamental piece of the artwork! of the magic! This artwork is all about the experience of collaboration and where it can take us as human beings, without your contribution it does not exist!</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;""> What You Get</span><br/></p><p>In Summary, this instalment of CollaboNation will result in</p><p>1. an enormous artwork created by a global network of beautiful human beings both physically present at Burning Man and present by contribution: celebrating, cultivating, and proliferating a collaborative attitude.</p><p>2. a short film/ documentary on the entire process and experience from birth to cremation, capturing the unique and beautiful personalities that contribute and their stories.</p><p>3. photo documentation including portraits of each burning man contributor and verbal musings from each.</p><p>4. the birth of a global project - Burning Man will be the launchpad for CollaboNation as a movement, with scope to travel across the globe, capturing the creativity and expression, and gaining insight into the minds of humans from contrasting walks of life -  ending in an exhibition of artworks from across the world and a social documentary on the people behind the paint.</p><p></p><p>UNIQUE PLEDGE REWARDS</p><p></p>

During my years of practice though, there has always been something missing for me. It was one event in May of last year that finally shed light on what that was. In Union Square, Manhattan last May, I rolled out a huge canvas on the pavement with some paints and brushes, and asked passers by to join in in helping me fill it with colour. The day that followed was the most beautiful display of human connection and expression I have ever witnessed, and brought me the most happiness of anything I have ever done.People from all walks of life dropped what they were doing and sat with me for 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 2 hours, and not only contributed to a vibrant and living artwork that grew and morphed throughout the day, but opened up to me and each other about their lives, their passions and their worries, their plans for the day, the poem they had written for their girlfriend, how their mum was pissed off with them because of this or that. Connecting with someone next to them that on the subway would not have recieved a smile. It struck me then, that this was what I wanted as an artist. I want to be the vehicle that cracks through those walls, that breaks the fear of creation and expression that the vast majority of society has. To create an opportunity for the beauty and positivity of collaborating and connecting with your fellow man or woman, boy or girl for the pure sake of enjoyment in a passing moment, to be seen and to be appreciated as a fundamentally human concept that has been somewhat squashed in our busy, modern world.CollaboNation at Burning Man Festival, Black Rock Desert, Navadahttp://www.burningman.com/whatisburningman/""Mission Statement..Our mission is to produce the annual event known as ""Burning Man"" and to guide, nurture and protect the more permanent community created by its culture. Our intention is to generate society that connects each individual to his or her creative powers, to participation in community, to the larger realm of civic life, and to the even greater world of nature that exists beyond society. We believe that the experience of Burning Man can produce positive spiritual change in the world. To this end, it is equally important that we communicate with one another, with the citizens of Black Rock City and with the community of Burning Man wherever it may arise. Burning Man is radically inclusive, and its meaning is potentially accessible to anyone. The touchstone of value in our culture will always be immediacy: experience before theory, moral relationships before politics, survival before services, roles before jobs, embodied ritual before symbolism, work before vested interest, participant support before sponsorship. Finally, in order to accomplish these ends, Burning Man must endure as a self-supporting enterprise that is capable of sustaining the lives of those who dedicate themselves to its work. From this devotion spring those duties that we owe to one another. We will always burn the Man. ""Not only does CollaboNation's values and intentions resonate harmoniously with those of Burning Man, but it is a temporary, transient society that assembles from all across the world in a collaborative and self reliant epicentre of conscious human celebration. The artwork that we create at Burning Man will be a collaboration between you guys, the funding contributors, from different places across the globe, and those at burning man that have travelled from all across the world to the Black Rock Desert - collaboratively funded, collaboratively created, and collaboratively experienced. Each contributor taking that seed back to their homes and effectively spreading it across the world.In the transient spirit of Burning Man, at the end of the festival and upon completion of the artwork, when all contributors have expressed and released what they needed to, the piece will be cremated and ashes savoured as a token of the moment in time when all of us crossed paths and gave our piece.As contributors you are a fundamental piece of the artwork! of the magic! This artwork is all about the experience of collaboration and where it can take us as human beings, without your contribution it does not exist! What You GetIn Summary, this instalment of CollaboNation will result in1. an enormous artwork created by a global network of beautiful human beings both physically present at Burning Man and present by contribution: celebrating, cultivating, and proliferating a collaborative attitude.2. a short film/ documentary on the entire process and experience from birth to cremation, capturing the unique and beautiful personalities that contribute and their stories.3. photo documentation including portraits of each burning man contributor and verbal musings from each.4. the birth of a global project - Burning Man will be the launchpad for CollaboNation as a movement, with scope to travel across the globe, capturing the creativity and expression, and gaining insight into the minds of humans from contrasting walks of life -  ending in an exhibition of artworks from across the world and a social documentary on the people behind the paint.UNIQUE PLEDGE REWARDS

<h3>The Story Begins...</h3>

Not the kind of magic that we get from watching CGI effects on a screen, but Magic that you can reach out and touch.

<p>Initially scheduled to be performed on November 19 - 22, 2013, during the XII World Congress of the Organization of World Heritage Cities<i><b>. </b></i>The new date for Viva La Vida is in December, between Christmas and New Year's. <br/></p>
<p>During my residency in the city of Oaxaca, Mexico (summer 2013) I found a beautiful
site of historic and cultural value, also as many Mexican monuments with a sad
and bloody past. I couldn't resist conjuring a performance in my head, my heart
and my body. I had that urgent sensation that many performers have:
to go and just do it - disregarding the risk of either being imprisoned or
being unnoticeable. I decided that to convey the message of this piece I
couldn't risk my freedom or my anonymity - I want a lot of people to know about
it and experience it with me from beginning to end. </p>
<p>This is where you come in...help me go back to Oaxaca and do an urban performance on the plaza of the church of Santo Domingo de Guzmán.<br/></p>

<br/><p></p>As a statement, as a gift, as a celebration of Mexico's rich culture in a blend of watermelon hearts, ancient rituals, bloody pasts and conflicting presents, and joy of life as revolution: <i><b>Viva La Vida</b></i>, with original music by guest artists Jesús González-Gutiérrez and Arturo Camacho. And just for
a brief time, the plaza will be transformed, people will be invited to participate
in a performance of synergetic rituals of Mesoamerican people and of catholic people. <p></p>
<p><b>Why performance</b></p>
<p>Performance art, the art of activating bodies and space through actions, allows to create an alternative world where new meanings can emerge through non-quotidian interactions, thus the possibility of dreams and other ways of being.</p>
<p><b>Why Oaxaca</b></p>
<p>A statement, a proposition that performance art, when brought to life, becomes part of a site's history, through people's embodied memory, just as historical events. Except that in <i>Viva La Vida</i> I seek to decontextualize a city's icon (the church of Santo Domingo) by bringing actions and symbols from the city's conflicting past. Our actions as individuals and as societies create our present as well as a road to the future. Oaxaca de Juárez,  declared by the UNESCO as a Humanities Cultural Patrimony city is rich in culture, natural resources, art, history, gastronomy, and one of Mexico's main touristic attractions yet it is also a city where thousands of children are without school, where there is violence against women, social inequality, and racial discrimination. These conditions, good and bad, play a role in people's everyday lives creating dynamic platforms for actions, reactions and interactions.<br/></p>
<p><b>What I need and what you get.</b></p>
<p>I want to pay all people who will contribute in this work: musicians for creating and performing new music, photographers for taking great pictures which will live for ever and will allow anyone who won't be present to see a glimpse or to have a memento, the videographers for capturing every moment through video and will allow us to relive it any time we want and to pay my self for creating this work which I hope you all enjoy and...this is my job. Besides that: I need to get to Oaxaca, live an eat, buy lots of watermelons and other things, print photos and make books. <br/></p>

I am holding on to many details about this piece because I don’t want to
spoil it. What I can say is that
it will be a performance rich in images, sound, symbols and actions using Santo Domingo's Baroque style and aesthetics of the local indigenous people and no humans, animals or plants will be harmed, only temporary natural dyes on
public buildings and possibly a few minor non-harming ideological shocks to some people. I will be notifying local authorities about this
event. <br/><p></p>

Initially scheduled to be performed on November 19 - 22, 2013, during the XII World Congress of the Organization of World Heritage Cities. The new date for Viva La Vida is in December, between Christmas and New Year's. 
During my residency in the city of Oaxaca, Mexico (summer 2013) I found a beautiful
site of historic and cultural value, also as many Mexican monuments with a sad
and bloody past. I couldn't resist conjuring a performance in my head, my heart
and my body. I had that urgent sensation that many performers have:
to go and just do it - disregarding the risk of either being imprisoned or
being unnoticeable. I decided that to convey the message of this piece I
couldn't risk my freedom or my anonymity - I want a lot of people to know about
it and experience it with me from beginning to end. 
This is where you come in...help me go back to Oaxaca and do an urban performance on the plaza of the church of Santo Domingo de Guzmán.




As a statement, as a gift, as a celebration of Mexico's rich culture in a blend of watermelon hearts, ancient rituals, bloody pasts and conflicting presents, and joy of life as revolution: Viva La Vida, with original music by guest artists Jesús González-Gutiérrez and Arturo Camacho. And just for
a brief time, the plaza will be transformed, people will be invited to participate
in a performance of synergetic rituals of Mesoamerican people and of catholic people. 
Why performance
Performance art, the art of activating bodies and space through actions, allows to create an alternative world where new meanings can emerge through non-quotidian interactions, thus the possibility of dreams and other ways of being.
Why Oaxaca
A statement, a proposition that performance art, when brought to life, becomes part of a site's history, through people's embodied memory, just as historical events. Except that in Viva La Vida I seek to decontextualize a city's icon (the church of Santo Domingo) by bringing actions and symbols from the city's conflicting past. Our actions as individuals and as societies create our present as well as a road to the future. Oaxaca de Juárez,  declared by the UNESCO as a Humanities Cultural Patrimony city is rich in culture, natural resources, art, history, gastronomy, and one of Mexico's main touristic attractions yet it is also a city where thousands of children are without school, where there is violence against women, social inequality, and racial discrimination. These conditions, good and bad, play a role in people's everyday lives creating dynamic platforms for actions, reactions and interactions.
What I need and what you get.
I want to pay all people who will contribute in this work: musicians for creating and performing new music, photographers for taking great pictures which will live for ever and will allow anyone who won't be present to see a glimpse or to have a memento, the videographers for capturing every moment through video and will allow us to relive it any time we want and to pay my self for creating this work which I hope you all enjoy and...this is my job. Besides that: I need to get to Oaxaca, live an eat, buy lots of watermelons and other things, print photos and make books. 
This is what I need:

Shipping                                                                  50
Total                                                                 $ 5,400

Perks
Anything helps and even the minimum $ 10 gift will give you the inside scoop of 'behind the scenes' (or behind my brain). 
The hand-made book about Viva La Vida, I would love to have one of those!
Besides, wouldn't it be great to have a one-week coach on creativity? (take a look at Baroque Night). And above all, you will get the joy of making Viva La Vida possible!
I am holding on to many details about this piece because I don’t want to
spoil it. What I can say is that
it will be a performance rich in images, sound, symbols and actions using Santo Domingo's Baroque style and aesthetics of the local indigenous people and no humans, animals or plants will be harmed, only temporary natural dyes on
public buildings and possibly a few minor non-harming ideological shocks to some people. I will be notifying local authorities about this
event. 
Spread the word! Thank you, thank you.

<h4>27/12/2011: </h4>
<p>Changed the title of the project from ""NV High"" to 'ELEPHANT IN ABSENTIA', as it better reflects my vision for the project as a slice of life instead of Degrassi: Mental Illness Edition. Extensively revised the description.</p>
<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">My name's Karl Parakenings. I'm a writer, graphic designer, narrative designer, and artist, currently on medical leave from an MA in English Literature. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I'm making an interactive graphic novel about living with an undiagnosed mental illness. Itâ€™s called ELEPHANT IN ABSENTIA.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">During my recent treatment, a big hurdle that I've had is trying to figure out how freaky I am: are there other people who think like me? Will I be looked at strangely because I mention my meds in conversation or ask not to go into a bar because I'll be overwhelmed to the point of panic?</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I want to help others with these diseases to feel like they fit in, like there are other people out there that have to deal with the elephant in the room. Most of all, I want to create resources that their friends and family can use to understand what everyday life is like for them. Itâ€™s not only children who are affected by ADHD; teenage and adult men and women are affected as well. It's not only teens who get depressed; 80% of North Americans will have a period of severe depression in their lives. It's incredibly common.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">But as it stands, mental illness is incredibly underrepresented in games and in mass media. For family and friends of sufferers of mental illness, and even for sufferers themselves, there are very, very few role models. If you have this illness, or if you know someone who has this illness, you're told to give them a suicide prevention hotline number.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">But what do you do when they're crying so hard that they're shaking? How do you get your support and empathy across the gulf of severe depression? There are few examples to follow, and none in the interactive medium of games.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I want to change that.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Along with my longtime friend and fellow ADHD sufferer D. McDowall, I'm creating an engaging and interactive graphic novel that features people who are mentally ill as people first, coping with everyday problems which are made more difficult by their disability, and those that care for and support them.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">A conservative estimate puts the number of adults with ADHD at seven million. Thatâ€™s just according to the current diagnostic criteria, which are slated to become wider in 2013. In other words, thatâ€™s just the amount of people who were diagnosed as children who continued to adulthood still fighting the disorder. People like me, who were diagnosed as adults, arenâ€™t factored into that.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Thereâ€™s a high chance of people with ADHD also having other disorders like anxiety and depression as well. Up to 37% of people with ADHD have depression or similar disorders. Those at risk for alcohol abuse climb to more than 50% in the population with ADHD. Think about how many moral panics you hear every year about teen substance abuse. In my case, I drank heavily because I wanted my brain to calm down. Iâ€™ve since stopped, but how many like me are out there right now?</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Iâ€™m reaching out to all these people and saying to them, â€œLook, there are people like you in the world. This is how you can cope. This is what you can tell your friends and family about this disease, and how they can best help.â€</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Iâ€™m going to make ELEPHANT IN ABSENTIA regardless of the funding we get through IndieGoGo. But you can help me make this happen, and you can help me get it to people who need to see it.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<h4>Funding Goals</h4>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">As it stands, if I make my goal, Iâ€™ll have enough money to make ELEPHANT IN ABSENTIA the way I want to. If I go any further than that, all additional resources will go towards making this game as fantastic as possible â€“ adding new characters and new storylines, a wider variety of locations, things like that.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">If the funding goes far enough over the mark, Iâ€™ll use the additional funds to secure development licenses and hardware that will allow me to port this game to iOS. </p>
<p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Iâ€™ll be honest â€“ Iâ€™m just scraping by with my freelance work. If you canâ€™t donate, I understand.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> But if you relate to this project at all, if youâ€™ve known people with mental illness and witnessed their struggle, or if you have it yourself, the best thing you can do is to share this project on Facebook, Google Plus, Twitter, or other social media using the tools above.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Point friends and family to ELEPHANT IN ABSENTIA, ask them to share it, and together weâ€™ll all make this interactive graphic novel a reality.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">If you want to find out more about attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder, please consult Mental Health Canada <a href=""http://www.mentalhealthcanada.com/ConditionsandDisordersDetail.asp?lang=e&amp;category=60"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title=""here"">here</a>, the Centre for ADHD Awareness at <a href=""http://www.caddac.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.caddac.ca</a>, or this informative series of slides about the economic cost of ADHD at <a href=""http://www.caddac.ca/cms/CADDAC_pdf/Weiss%20The%20Economic%20Costs%20of%20ADHD.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.caddac.ca/cms/CADDAC_pdf/Weiss%20The...</a></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">If you think that you have ADHD or depression, see a doctor as soon as you can. If they say you don't but it's getting in the way of your life, get a second opinion.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Thank you for reading.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Iâ€™m using Ren-Py, a Python-based visual novel creation kit, to create ELEPHANT IN ABSENTIA. Because of my varied background, excepting music, I could do the whole thing myself.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The problem is time.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">As a freelance graphic/web designer, most of my time has to go to business considerations first: finding clients, billing, invoicing, marketing my brand, networking, etc. Then I spend most of whatâ€™s left actually working. Thereâ€™s precious little time and no income left for side projects like ELEPHANT IN ABSENTIA.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Every dollar you donate to this project goes towards its development, both buying time for me to work on it and buying actual assets and resources used in its development.  If I donâ€™t make my goal, itâ€™s all going towards these parts of development. Iâ€™m making this graphic novel even if I have to eat ramen to do it.</p>
<h5>Art</h5>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Traditionally visual novels sprouted from Japanese anime and manga and, today, maintain the styles and conventions of that medium. I want to move beyond that. ELEPHANT IN ABSENTIA will feature a dynamic take on the visual novel genre, one that borrows liberally from the styles of artists like Daniel Clowes, Adrien Tomine, Rebecca Dart, Erika Moen, Jess Fink, and the video game developer Cing to create an independent, subversive take on the visual novel form.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In other words, I donâ€™t want to make a VN just like all the others out there. I want to make one that looks and feels unique.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Other amateur projects like Katawa Shoujo have taken years to amass an art team with the skills necessary to develop the game. Iâ€™ve already reached out to many artists with the skills and style needed to make ELEPHANT IN ABSENTIA a success. Help give me the ability to hire them and make this plan a reality.</p>
<h5>Music</h5>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">With sufficient funds, I can hire musicians through sites like <a href=""http://freelancemusiccomposers.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://freelancemusiccomposers.com/</a> and <a href=""http://www.youngcomposers.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youngcomposers.com/</a> and work with them to create a soundtrack to ELEPHANT IN ABSENTIA thatâ€™s both attractive and effective. If youâ€™ve ever seen a film like <em>Brick, Jurassic Park, Pulp Fiction, The Life Aquatic</em> or <em>The Third Man</em>, you know that music can make or break an emotional scene. Aside from everything else, I want ELEPHANT IN ABSENTIA to be a story that resonates with people emotionally â€“ and I need music for that.</p>
<h5>Advertising and Marketing</h5>
<div>If this gets any funding through IndieGoGo, it'll have some word-of-mouth exposure. But any game, especially one that has any hint of education or awareness behind it, needs advertising to survive and succeed. And advertising costs money. Not only that, but I'd like to actually print flyers and cards to promote the game at various industry events, and that needs money too.</div>

Our Story
 
My name's Karl Parakenings. I'm a writer, graphic designer, narrative designer, and artist, currently on medical leave from an MA in English Literature. 
 
I'm making an interactive graphic novel about living with an undiagnosed mental illness. Itâ€™s called ELEPHANT IN ABSENTIA.
 
 
During my recent treatment, a big hurdle that I've had is trying to figure out how freaky I am: are there other people who think like me? Will I be looked at strangely because I mention my meds in conversation or ask not to go into a bar because I'll be overwhelmed to the point of panic?

But as it stands, mental illness is incredibly underrepresented in games and in mass media. For family and friends of sufferers of mental illness, and even for sufferers themselves, there are very, very few role models. If you have this illness, or if you know someone who has this illness, you're told to give them a suicide prevention hotline number.
 
But what do you do when they're crying so hard that they're shaking? How do you get your support and empathy across the gulf of severe depression? There are few examples to follow, and none in the interactive medium of games.
 
I want to change that.
 
 
Along with my longtime friend and fellow ADHD sufferer D. McDowall, I'm creating an engaging and interactive graphic novel that features people who are mentally ill as people first, coping with everyday problems which are made more difficult by their disability, and those that care for and support them.
 
 
The Impact
 
A conservative estimate puts the number of adults with ADHD at seven million. Thatâ€™s just according to the current diagnostic criteria, which are slated to become wider in 2013. In other words, thatâ€™s just the amount of people who were diagnosed as children who continued to adulthood still fighting the disorder.

If I go any further than that, all additional resources will go towards making this game as fantastic as possible â€“ adding new characters and new storylines, a wider variety of locations, things like that.
 
If the funding goes far enough over the mark, Iâ€™ll use the additional funds to secure development licenses and hardware that will allow me to port this game to iOS. 
 
 
 
Other Ways You Can Help
 
Iâ€™ll be honest â€“ Iâ€™m just scraping by with my freelance work. If you canâ€™t donate, I understand.
 
 
 But if you relate to this project at all, if youâ€™ve known people with mental illness and witnessed their struggle, or if you have it yourself, the best thing you can do is to share this project on Facebook, Google Plus, Twitter, or other social media using the tools above.

Thank you for reading.
 
 
What We Need & What You Get
 
Iâ€™m using Ren-Py, a Python-based visual novel creation kit, to create ELEPHANT IN ABSENTIA. Because of my varied background, excepting music, I could do the whole thing myself.
 
The problem is time.
 
As a freelance graphic/web designer, most of my time has to go to business considerations first: finding clients, billing, invoicing, marketing my brand, networking, etc. Then I spend most of whatâ€™s left actually working. Thereâ€™s precious little time and no income left for side projects like ELEPHANT IN ABSENTIA.
 
Every dollar you donate to this project goes towards its development, both buying time for me to work on it and buying actual assets and resources used in its development.  If I donâ€™t make my goal, itâ€™s all going towards these parts of development. Iâ€™m making this graphic novel even if I have to eat ramen to do it.
Art
 
Traditionally visual novels sprouted from Japanese anime and manga and, today, maintain the styles and conventions of that medium. I want to move beyond that. ELEPHANT IN ABSENTIA will feature a dynamic take on the visual novel genre, one that borrows liberally from the styles of artists like Daniel Clowes, Adrien Tomine, Rebecca Dart, Erika Moen, Jess Fink, and the video game developer Cing to create an independent, subversive take on the visual novel form.
 
In other words, I donâ€™t want to make a VN just like all the others out there. I want to make one that looks and feels unique.
 
Other amateur projects like Katawa Shoujo have taken years to amass an art team with the skills necessary to develop the game. Iâ€™ve already reached out to many artists with the skills and style needed to make ELEPHANT IN ABSENTIA a success. Help give me the ability to hire them and make this plan a reality.
Music
 
With sufficient funds, I can hire musicians through sites like http://freelancemusiccomposers.com/ and http://www.youngcomposers.com/ and work with them to create a soundtrack to ELEPHANT IN ABSENTIA thatâ€™s both attractive and effective. If youâ€™ve ever seen a film like Brick, Jurassic Park, Pulp Fiction, The Life Aquatic or The Third Man, you know that music can make or break an emotional scene. Aside from everything else, I want ELEPHANT IN ABSENTIA to be a story that resonates with people emotionally â€“ and I need music for that.
Advertising and Marketing
If this gets any funding through IndieGoGo, it'll have some word-of-mouth exposure. But any game, especially one that has any hint of education or awareness behind it, needs advertising to survive and succeed. And advertising costs money. Not only that, but I'd like to actually print flyers and cards to promote the game at various industry events, and that needs money too.

<h3>We Always Aim High</h3>
<p>At GRMakers (<a href=""http://www.grmakers.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.grmakers.com</a>), we don't settle for the safe option.  GRMakers is a Grand Rapids area co-working space dedicated to providing its community with a collaborative environment with access to a workshop where they can manufacture almost anything.  We have watched art rise from our space, businesses find success, and our members grow both in skill and in confidence.  When we were approached by our artist, Denise Langeweg, to help create one of the largest robotic LED light sculptures ArtPrize has ever seen, we knew we had to be involved.  After many months of discussion on what would make this a successful project, we identified our goals:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Recycle LED Light assemblies donated by Tekton Tools.</li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Occupy the entire four story glass stairwell at the Urban Institute of Contemporary Arts (UICA) and fill it with light.</span></li>
<li>Utilize our talented community members to design, fabricate and promote this project.</li>
<li>Create a unique collaborative experience for the ArtPrize audience.</li>
</ul>
<div>""Exposed"" is an interactive art installation that is built like a chandelier.  It hangs from the ceiling and begins as a <b>30 ft tall</b><b></b> spiral structure brilliantly lit with approximately <b>30,000 LED lights</b>.  What makes this sculpture unique is that audience interaction causes the top and bottom spirals to part in the middle and expose a sculpture hidden in the center.  Imagine a giant, tapered, brightly lit slinky opening on its own and you have a small idea of how amazing this is going to be.</div>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/807391/files/20140823160049-Exposed_Assm_UICA_Picture_resized.jpg?1408834849"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>

<br/>
</div>
<h3>This is going to be expensive...</h3> <p>Almost everything about this project is costly.  What we need:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Materials (metal, motors)</li>
<li>Machine time (waterjet)</li>
<li>Custom electronic controller boards and related wiring/hardware</li>
<li>Custom programming of controller</li>
<li>Insurance</li>
</ul>
<div><h3>Why this, why now?</h3></div>
<div>Being artists, tinkerers, technologists, fabricators, and designers, we know we work best when we team up.  Collaboration is the focus of our community, GRMakers, and the the ArtPrize theme of our venue, the UICA.  We knew we had to be involved in a big way so we set our goals very high..., four stories high.</div>
<div>Why:</div>
</div><div><ul>
<li>We want to show the ArtPrize community and its audience that art is accessible to everyone, not only by experiencing it, but also having the ability to create it.</li>
<li><span>We've had a number of our members create individual ArtPrize pieces before and have collaborated on others.  Last year, we were happy to collaborate on Gon Kirin (<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/gonkirin"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.facebook.com/gonkirin</a>) and help them be successful.<br/></span></li>
<li>ArtPrize is the perfect opportunity to communicate this idealistic concept of participation in art and build our community of friends dedicated to an open, collaborative spirit.</li> </ul></div> <div> <h3>What we face...</h3> <p>We have a thousand hours of work ahead of us before the opening of ArtPrize in September.  We always have the worry in the back of our minds, and hearts, of how we are going to afford each next step of the project.  More funding would help us to focus only on the process of creating a very ambitious project.</p>
<p>Our artist and our community of collaborators are talented, selfless individuals who are very excited about being part of this project.  They are intent on doing a world class job creating something that will be memorable to everyone who sees it, touches it, and interacts with it.</p>
<p></p>

</div></div>","We Always Aim High
At GRMakers (http://www.grmakers.com), we don't settle for the safe option.  GRMakers is a Grand Rapids area co-working space dedicated to providing its community with a collaborative environment with access to a workshop where they can manufacture almost anything.  We have watched art rise from our space, businesses find success, and our members grow both in skill and in confidence.  When we were approached by our artist, Denise Langeweg, to help create one of the largest robotic LED light sculptures ArtPrize has ever seen, we knew we had to be involved.  After many months of discussion on what would make this a successful project, we identified our goals:


Recycle LED Light assemblies donated by Tekton Tools.
Occupy the entire four story glass stairwell at the Urban Institute of Contemporary Arts (UICA) and fill it with light.
Utilize our talented community members to design, fabricate and promote this project.
Create a unique collaborative experience for the ArtPrize audience.

""Exposed"" is an interactive art installation that is built like a chandelier.  It hangs from the ceiling and begins as a 30 ft tall spiral structure brilliantly lit with approximately 30,000 LED lights.  What makes this sculpture unique is that audience interaction causes the top and bottom spirals to part in the middle and expose a sculpture hidden in the center.  Imagine a giant, tapered, brightly lit slinky opening on its own and you have a small idea of how amazing this is going to be.






This is going to be expensive... Almost everything about this project is costly.  What we need:


Materials (metal, motors)
Machine time (waterjet)
Custom electronic controller boards and related wiring/hardware
Custom programming of controller
Insurance

Why this, why now?
Being artists, tinkerers, technologists, fabricators, and designers, we know we work best when we team up.  Collaboration is the focus of our community, GRMakers, and the the ArtPrize theme of our venue, the UICA.  We knew we had to be involved in a big way so we set our goals very high..., four stories high.
Why:

We want to show the ArtPrize community and its audience that art is accessible to everyone, not only by experiencing it, but also having the ability to create it.
We've had a number of our members create individual ArtPrize pieces before and have collaborated on others.  Last year, we were happy to collaborate on Gon Kirin (http://www.facebook.com/gonkirin) and help them be successful.
ArtPrize is the perfect opportunity to communicate this idealistic concept of participation in art and build our community of friends dedicated to an open, collaborative spirit.   What we face... We have a thousand hours of work ahead of us before the opening of ArtPrize in September.  We always have the worry in the back of our minds, and hearts, of how we are going to afford each next step of the project.  More funding would help us to focus only on the process of creating a very ambitious project.
Our artist and our community of collaborators are talented, selfless individuals who are very excited about being part of this project.  They are intent on doing a world class job creating something that will be memorable to everyone who sees it, touches it, and interacts with it.

<p>I’m going to Korea!  I’ve already bought the tickets, booked a residence &amp; shipped the art!</p>
<h4>Who am I?</h4>
<p>Hi!  My name is Sara, and I’m a fractal artist!  What’s a fractal? 
 Fractals are essentially infinitely repeating mathematical patterns.  
And I am totally obsessed with them!  They are everywhere in nature- the branching structure of trees, for example, is a type of fractal pattern.  Self-similarity is the key feature of any fractal:  simple patterns &amp; forms that are repeated at all scales.  What you get is a structure of infinite complexity, 
derived from a very simple set of rules.</p>
<h4>An artist who likes math?</h4>
<p>Yep.  I’ve always loved science &amp; nature, so I couldn’t pass up 
the chance to go to the local Science &amp; Technology magnet high 
school.  But I also grew up in a home that fostered creativity and a 
love of art.  So when I decided to go to the Maryland Institute College 
of Art, I knew that I needed to find a way to bring my two loves 
together!  Fractals are the perfect marriage of science, mathematics 
&amp; art.  So much beauty can be derived from these amazing 
mathematical patterns!  And I want to show them to the world!</p>
<h4>So why Korea?</h4>
<p>I’ve recently been presented with a FANTASTIC opportunity: To show my
 work at the Annual Bridges Art &amp; Mathematics Conference!  This 
week-long conference is dedicated to “bridging” the gap between math 
&amp; art.  Just like I am!  And it will be filled with amazing artists,
 professors, mathematicians and other talented &amp; creative folks with
 the same passion as me!  And *I* get to share my work with them!  This 
year the conference is being held in Seoul, South Korea.  (Woah)  But I 
couldn’t pass up the opportunity to travel to a new, exotic place &amp; 
meet all of these amazing like-minded people.  </p><div align=""center"">

<h3>Tarot of Cyclicity - life is rhythm</h3>
<p>The traditional depiction of the cards is explicit and static. The scenes represent situations while the solutions are at the discretion of the interpreter. Everything follows according to predefined scenarios. When someone saw a lying man face down on the ground and stabbed in his back with ten oversised swords, there is none or very little room left for interpretation.</p>
<p>The Waite-Smith’s Ten of Swords is arbitrary, definitive and irreversible. It speaks about the violent end and an inevitable tragic outcome.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549255161/j6kku3ogdwaohnh6n7cw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>However, life is not a series of snapshots, but it is a flowing movie. Life means motion because nothing is static in the universe. Situations are changeable, and humans can make their own choices and determine their own fates. Life is rhythm.</p>
<p>The Ten of Swords of the Tarot of Cyclicity leave someone’s options open. Ten possible escape paths penetrate the circles of the blades.</p>
<p>With the Tarot of Cyclicity you can choose and you can write your own scenarios. You have the possibility to change the rhythm and make your life better. </p>
<h3>A little bit of philosophy</h3>
<p>Life on Earth is cyclical and our lives may feel sometimes like we are running in the same circle all over again. It is in your power to break the circle. </p>
<p>In theory, the average life expectancy is 84 years - although currently, it is of only 71 years. The 84 years can be divided into 12 'slices' of 7 years each.  Each slice represents one Zodiac sign. These 12 slices can be further divided into three. These are the 36 decans of the Zodiac represented by the 36 numerals of the Tarot deck. Each Zodiac sign has three decans and one decan is approximatively 2 years and 4 months. We traverse these decans one by one from the day we were born till the day we will die. We live our lives exposed to all these external, human and astral influences unknowingly, unconsciously. Our life is a long string of 'accidents' and unpredictable happenings where we are only passive participants. Life is happening to us. However, by conscious effort, learning and spiritual development, we have the power to change that and transform the circle of life into an upward spiral of evolution. The Tarot is the map of the universe and the guide to the path of enlightenment. </p>
<p>The cards of the Tarot of Cyclicity are like mirrors. You can only see yourself and the things you know. More you will learn, more you will be able to see and understand.</p>

<h3>Tarot &amp; therapy - know thyself</h3>
<p>The Tarot is not only an advanced instrument for making predictions - educated guesses, but it is also an instrument of self-observation, self-remembering, self-study and therapy. Know yourself and you will understand others; study others and you will learn about yourself.</p>
<p>Combining both teachings of Gurdjieff and Jung, the Tarot can be an important part of the healing and developing processes. </p>
<p>Someone can lay out the cards face up and chose a couple of cards or ask another person to draw some cards. Studying these cards may shred a new light upon someone's current state of mind and soul.</p>
<p>And this is just one of the countless possibilities. The Tarot of Cyclicity is a flexible tool and everyone can find and develop the method of using it which way suits her or him the best.  The only limits are those that someone imposes on themselves. The round shape of the cards suggests the infinite nature of the universe and of our possibilities. For individual or group therapy, the Tarot of Cyclicity opens up new paths of exploration and study. </p>
<p>Focusing on the cards you will embark on a fantastic journey.  </p>

<h3>The three cards reading</h3>
<p>With these <strong>three cards promotional reading</strong>, we will dive into the relationship of conscious, subconscious and unconscious. <br/>No matter what is on your mind, what is the issue that most concerns you right now, you should take into consideration these three aspects.</p>
<p>The seventy-eight cards of the Tarot deck are dividable into three. These three categories represent what in Astrology we call Cardinal, Fixed and Mutable Qualities.</p>
<p><br/>The 1st card represents the Fixed quality, respectively the conscious.<br/>The 2nd card represents the Cardinal quality, respectively the subconscious.<br/>The 3rd card represents the Mutable quality, respectively the unconscious.</p>
<p>You will receive the three cards I have drawn specially for you and the written interpretation by mail. </p>
<h3>Tarot Renewal, the book</h3>
<p>No more digital booklets - sorry! I am concerned about the constant process of dematerialisation, which, paradoxically is parallel with the constant loss of spirituality versus consumerism and materialism. A book is a book, it is worth something spiritually and it has weight physically.  A book should be something special, something truly Magick!</p>
<p>Although not integrated part of this ongoing campaign, the book is an important component of this project. Later this year, a large accompanying printed book entitled <strong>""Tarot Renewal""</strong> will be published and it will be available separately on Lulu, a print-on-demand platform. However, please keep in mind that the price of the Tarot decks does not include the printed book. </p>
<p>The book is a complete theoretical and practical guide. It includes a brief history and analyses of the evolution of the esoteric Tarot and the use of the deck for game playing across Europe. </p>
<p>The book will introduce basic notions of Astrology, Numerology and Alchemy and how they are fully integrated into the Tarot. It will also feature both traditional and modern interpretation of the cards as a foundation for your own further development.  Not at least, will present technics of reading the cards, respectively use the cards for self-development and therapeutical purposes. </p>

<h3>Accessories and clothes</h3>
<p>A large collection of clothes and accessories based on the design of the Major Arcana cards, including t-shirts, tanks, sweatshirts, pullover hoody, zip-up hoody, fine art prints, stretched canvas, mounted aluminum prints, mounted acrylic prints, blankets, duvets, shower curtains, rugs, tapestries, throw pillows, bath mats and many accessories including stickers, phone cases, mugs, water bottles, bags, notebooks, zip pouches and beach towels are available exclusively on <a href=""https://www.threadless.com/discover/s/tarotator/collection/tarot-of-cyclicity-major-arcana"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>threadless.com</strong></a>. It's time to renew your wardrobe with a little bit of Magick!</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div>
<p>This is my third rodeo on IndieGoGo, and I like to believe that there will be no surprises. The two previous decks were published and safely delivered. However, this doesn't mean we won't be facing challenges.  Sometimes getting the funds transferred takes longer than normally should. There is always something going not according to plan when printing. International shipping is always complicated.  I added extra time in the planning just to be sure.</p>
<p>The <strong>flexible goal</strong> means that if only one person will contribute, she or he will be the only one who will get the deck at the 10% off discount price. It is simple like that!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you can not contribute maybe you know other people who might be interested. Please get the word out and make some noise about this project. Any help is highly appreciated! </li>
<li>Please use the Indiegogo share tools!</li>

<p>Thank you very much!</p>

I am concerned about the constant process of dematerialisation, which, paradoxically is parallel with the constant loss of spirituality versus consumerism and materialism. A book is a book, it is worth something spiritually and it has weight physically.  A book should be something special, something truly Magick!
Although not integrated part of this ongoing campaign, the book is an important component of this project. Later this year, a large accompanying printed book entitled ""Tarot Renewal"" will be published and it will be available separately on Lulu, a print-on-demand platform. However, please keep in mind that the price of the Tarot decks does not include the printed book. 
The book is a complete theoretical and practical guide. It includes a brief history and analyses of the evolution of the esoteric Tarot and the use of the deck for game playing across Europe. 
The book will introduce basic notions of Astrology, Numerology and Alchemy and how they are fully integrated into the Tarot. It will also feature both traditional and modern interpretation of the cards as a foundation for your own further development.  Not at least, will present technics of reading the cards, respectively use the cards for self-development and therapeutical purposes. 

Accessories and clothes
A large collection of clothes and accessories based on the design of the Major Arcana cards, including t-shirts, tanks, sweatshirts, pullover hoody, zip-up hoody, fine art prints, stretched canvas, mounted aluminum prints, mounted acrylic prints, blankets, duvets, shower curtains, rugs, tapestries, throw pillows, bath mats and many accessories including stickers, phone cases, mugs, water bottles, bags, notebooks, zip pouches and beach towels are available exclusively on threadless.com. It's time to renew your wardrobe with a little bit of Magick!
Risks & Challenges

This is my third rodeo on IndieGoGo, and I like to believe that there will be no surprises. The two previous decks were published and safely delivered. However, this doesn't mean we won't be facing challenges.  Sometimes getting the funds transferred takes longer than normally should. There is always something going not according to plan when printing. International shipping is always complicated.  I added extra time in the planning just to be sure.
The flexible goal means that if only one person will contribute, she or he will be the only one who will get the deck at the 10% off discount price. It is simple like that!

Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:

If you can not contribute maybe you know other people who might be interested. Please get the word out and make some noise about this project. Any help is highly appreciated! 
Please use the Indiegogo share tools!

<h3><strong>Story</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I’m Ladan Tofighi, an Iranian artist living and working in Milan, Italy.</p>
<p>Working as an artist has been a challenge my entire life, from working as a female artist in my home country, Iran, to being an immigrant who works as an Iranian artist internationally.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Besides that, over the past year, COVID-19 has rapidly changed our lives. As an illustrator and painter, I have been trying to tackle the challenge of selling my works. Most events and exhibitions got cancelled, so finding different ways of sharing my artworks and connecting to the world has been vital for progress.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the exhibitions and events are beginning to show signs of reopening. In recent months I have participated in many international open calls to reconnect with live audience, which mostly required paying participation fees. In addition, if your artworks are accepted, you are burdened with the cost of renting the space and shipping the artworks. Due to these high costs, I had to withdraw from many exhibitions. This is why I decided to launch a campaign to raise funds that will allow me to participate in exhibitions and start making money as an artist again.</p>
<p>To see my paintings hop over to my website:</p>
<p><a href=""https://ladantofighi.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://ladantofighi.com/</a></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>What the money raised is being applied to:</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I am using this campaign to pay for the cost of the participation of my latest project _a series of oil paintings on canvas_ in the calls and exhibitions, rent of space, shipping of paintings, and travel expenses.</p>
<p>Putting on a show has a lot of expense. The largest is of course the rental fee, so that takes a large share of the funding. Additionally there is the cost of transportation of  large paintings on canvas  ( 120.100 cm, 2 70.100 cm, 50.70 cm) and travel expenses. </p>
<p>Open calls and exhibitions which I’m participating</p>
<p> Art Fair Frankfurt</p>
<p>Itsliquid</p>
<p>Focus art fair</p>
<p>Artkeys prize</p>
<p>Innovate grant</p>
<p>Innovative Grant</p>
<p>Hopper prize</p>
<p>Air Gallery, United Kingdom</p>
<p>Haze Gallery, Berlin  </p>
<p>mazemagazine</p>
<p>With your help, I will be able to use  4,000 euros to sell my artworks and make up for a low financial period. I cherish your love and support; every euro counts!</p>

<h3><strong>ARTIST STATEMENT</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>These paintings belong to my latest series “Another world”. I switched back to canvas and oil colors after some years of working with ink and watercolor to realize the multi-color ideas and dreams which I experienced in the past few months; the world in which the sea is wavy and the mountains are ready to explode. They are colorful and dreamy and convey the world in which you can bloom on the tree or just relax under its shade; through imagination the choice is yours! All the characters are some part of me which appear on canvas honestly.</p>
<p>This project is still in progress.</p>

<h3><br/></h3><h3>What Is Aural Borealis?</h3><p></p><p><span>Stepping into Aural Borealis will be a mind expanding auditory and sensory experience. Imagine 27 floating archways, extending over 80 feet hovering above you displaying a dazzling array of multicolor LED patterns. The light show produced by the archways are both interactive and audio responsive, meaning you can control the coordinated light patterns of Aural Borealis while it listens to the surrounding auditory environment or stand under the arches and be mesmerized by the colors dancing above your head. Powered by the visual development platform Touch Designer, Aural Borealis has three forms of input; </span></p><p><span>1) Maschine midi control (to set your own patterns and alter preformed light sequences), <br/>2) 3D Kinect motion sensors to detect dancing, hand motions, or however your soul would like to express itself, and <br/>3) Audio input, which will dance to the surrounding music. </span></p><p><span>Aural Borealis will enable you to express yourself through LED light and animation like nothing else you have seen.<br/></span></p><p>Further, through development of this project and in combination with 3D

Hi guys! Thank you for checking out our project!
A Little About Me (Susan Coffey)I have been modeling and putting together a body of 
work for over 5 years. I have worked with over 100 photographers and 
have reached goals in my modeling career that I never thought would 
happen. I am grateful for the immense support that I have received and 
hope to produce some unique projects/products for my fans.

Just like last time, printing isn’t cheap so I need your help! If we reach our goal, we’ll 
be able to produce the next LIMITED EDITION poster for my awesome supporters.

<p>As an artist and photographer, I have been engaged in the Life Imitates
Art series (based on a concept by Oscar Wilde) for over three decades. In this
ongoing series of photographs, I juxtapose images of contemporary people with
their likenesses in works from art history. I find my subjects either by “recognizing”
a person I know in a work of art at a museum or in an image in a book, or by
seeing someone in everyday life who reminds me of a person or character in a
painting from the past. I then approach these individuals, explain my project,
and ask if they are willing to collaborate with me in exchange for a finished
photograph. I then do the research to find the specific painting or
drawing I need, and set up a photo session to create a portrait that replicates
the painting in a new way.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The resulting diptychs, each consisting of a photograph of the
living person juxtaposed with the work of art, have been reproduced in
magazines worldwide, including the </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Sunday

editor and widely published writer on photography, and toward the production of
the book itself. </p>
<p>I received my MFA in painting from Mills College, Oakland, CA and used these skills in color printing, adjusting skin tones for compatibility with the painting.

<h3>Sucker Punched 2</h3>
<p>Welcome to Sucker Punched 2! The first iteration of Sucker Punched was so well received, we're bringing it back for more! </p>
<p>For those of you who are back, welcome! Thanks for joining us for another go 'round! </p>
<p>To those of you who are new to us, come on in! We are <a href=""http://www.fightguyphotography.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FightGuy Photography</a> - a photography studio based in Northern Virginia, specializing in portraits and events. Sucker Punched is one of our babies. </p>
<p>Sucker Punched was primarily inspired by the Zack Snyder film, <i>Sucker Punch</i>. We started doing a few shoots, trying to match the tone and style. From there, the project grew and took on a sense of empowerment and agency. We had a lot of models interested in doing a shoot of this style and a lot of fans interested in seeing more. With great power came great responsibility, so we launched last year's campaign to make a full series of these shoots and connected with <a href=""http://www.rainn.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">RAINN</a> (The Rape Abuse and Incest National Network) to make sure we did some good with this project. Sucker Punched was a great success and we all walked away feeling great about it. Well, we're doing it again. More models, new characters and another year of promoting strong, feminine images.</p>
<p>Our goal with Sucker Punched is to present original characters, created in the style of powerful archetypes. We've got designs drawn from the best of fiction, local and regional models who will knock it out of the park, and fine photographic skills to bring it all together. The models involved are presented as a celebration of powerful women, dangerous and strong. This is no ""bikini babe"" project here, quite the opposite really.</p>
<p>(If you'd like to read a much longer-winded version of what we're all about, check out last year's campaign <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/sucker-punched-a-photo-project/x/2593569"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>)</p>

<li>Additionally, a large number of our purchases will be made from small, independent artisans, to help support local businesses and artists. </li>

This year we are upping the ante to 12 characters (With our stretch goal of 14 if we beat our goal!). We've got big dreams and we want you to be in on them!</div><div>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>What is this project all about? Well, first, it's a heck of a lot of fun. Moreover, it's a project that creates and promotes a positive message. These characters are feminine and powerful. They have full agency over who they are and what they're doing.

In addition to sail power, the boat uses a diesel engine to motor in and out of ports and difficult areas.

Despite the inexpensive cost of the boat in its current condition, the timing and work needed to prepare the boat have made a drastic impact on their plans. Hurricane Sandy hit a couple days after acquiring the new vessel Vacilanda, destroying their home in <a href=""http://gothamist.com/2012/11/05/photos_rockaway_beach_parking_lot_l.php#photo-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Rockaway"">Rockaway</a>, and leaving the marina with a pile of boats stacked in the parking lot. The crew postponed their plans to leave and began working daily in their neighborhood of Rockaway bringing generators and pumps to houses with water-filled basements and distribution centers in need of power. Additionally, two other potential members of the original crew planning to sail the distance to Panama chose to remain in Rockaway over the winter where they were greatly needed. Herreshoff, Peter, and Victoria have now taken on the life-changing task of outfitting their new sailing home to begin the long, initial trip from New York City to Bocas del Toro, Panama.

Reinforcements are being made to parts of the hull, deck, and rigging. The crew is doing all of the work on their own to remain within their budget with help only from knowledgable local friends. In preparation for the trip, the Vacilanda crew has been compiling lists of contacts and suggestions, where the wealth of knowledge is mostly found. The three of them plan to catalog their findings, route, ports, destinations, and difficulties along the way, opening up the possibility for others to access valuable information for personal interest of for the purpose of making the same trip.

<p></p>
<h3> Vision</h3>
<p>Paper is EVERYWHERE. It's so prevalent in our daily lives it becomes static in many people's minds.  When I tell people that I make paper, the most common assumption is that I make origami, or cards, or some other art using ready-made commercial papers.  I have to explain first that, yes I make cards and books, but first, before anything else, I have to create the sheets of paper I am going to use.  <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Many people see paper as a medium on which to make art, not a medium out of which art can be made.  I like to challenge that notion by focusing on the paper itself when making my art.  I want to reduce wasted paper and cardboard, give new life to old materials, make human connections through my work, and give back to the communities that have made White Dragon Paper what it is today.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Through White Dragon Paper I try to share this perspective with as many people as I can.  Exposing young kids to this idea early puts the idea into their head to question materials and art, and inspires them to use old materials in new ways.  Art fosters creativity, confidence, and curiosity.  I often talk to people who say they made paper in scouts or at school using dryer lint, or are familiar with paper mache.  Through White Dragon Paper, I want to follow up on these initial, basic exposures and teach people to look at paper that they were going to throw away, and think ""Who can use this?  Can I do something more with it?""</span></p>
<p>These expansions and collaborations have allowed me to do wonderful things, including expending my business products lines and giving back to the community. In the summer of 2014 I volunteered to teach paper-making to a camp full of kids who have or have had cancer, for a full week (and I'm excited to have been invited back this summer).  This year I've been contacted by some local libraries to teach recycled paper arts to their teens.</p>
<p>So why have I started this campaign?</p>
<p>I am currently renting the use of a Reina paper beater from one of my studio roommates.  The Reina paper beater is a particular brand of Hollander beater, a machine that churns recycled office paper, cardboard, or plant fibers up into a mush that can then be used to make sheets of new paper.  New, these machines cost upwards of $9000 depending on the model and size.  Some sell for $16k.  Finding these machines used is like finding a blue lobster.  It happens, but people tend to hang on to their paper beaters as long as they can because there aren't many of them made, they're expensive, and they're easier to repair than replace if they break down.  When a used beater does pop up for sale, the seller has their pick of offers.</p>
<p>An opportunity to purchase a Valley paper beater (the little brother to the Reina beater) fell into our lap.  I won't always be located in Columbus where I am able to share equipment with the artist I currently rent usage from.  My girlfriend is in the last years of her Masters program for Library and Information Science.  She may get a job out of state after she graduates, and I'll go with her with our two rescued dogs, rabbit, and fish in tow.  When we move, I will need to have a paper beater to go with me so I can continue my paper-making.  Fundraising $9000-$16000 to purchase a paper beater new is a much steeper goal than the $3000 this artist is asking for his used Valley model.  The additional $1000 of this campaign's goal is going to be used to cover materials and shipping for perks, as well as to make sure we end up with a lump sum of $3000 to hand the artist as payment for the Valley beater after all the fees and taxes are taken out (approximately 10%) of the money raised.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We need $4000 to cover the complete cost of this goal.  $3000 will go directly to the artist we are purchasing the Valley Beater from.  We expect 10% of the raised funds to go toward fees and taxes, and the remaining $600 is going to cover materials and shipping for all of the great perks we're offering to those who help!</p>

<p></p>
<p>What will we do if we raise more than $4000?  Well, first of all that would be AWESOME.  What we would do with the extra money would depend on how MUCH more we raise.  A few dollars?  We'll send it toward the summer camp to help cover supplies for our week in 2015.  $1-500?  We'll reach out to the Columbus, Ohio community to sponsor as many free workshops for local kids and teens as we can afford with it.  A thousand extra?  We'll sponsor local workshops, and purchase a pop up tent for the studio to use on bright sunny days for festivals, workshops, and community projects.  Thousands more?  We'll sponsor several workshops for the local community, buy the tent, and put the remainder of the funds toward purchasing a small, used pickup truck to transport all the equipment we use for workshops and festivals.</p>

</div><div> <p>Paper-making is my passion.  I got so hooked with those first few sheets of paper that I made in 2007 that I never stopped.  I didn't worry about how big this could get or how I would affect so many people.  I just made the paper and rode the waves that came from the ripples I created.</p>
<p>By contributing to this project, you will be fueling my passion.  You'll be helping me keep boxes upon boxes of used paper out of the landfills.  Your impact will be with me as I pulverize each batch of paper and pull each sheet.  You will have helped each sheet and each book or each child's project come into being and go on to impact someone else's life when they use it to record their poetry or send invitations to their wedding.  Not only will you be supporting a small business that is dedicated to giving back to small communities, you'll be supporting one that also is very conscious of its impact on the global community.  We work to find ways to reduce the largest category of waste produced by Americans each year, and in doing so also foster creativity, exploration, curiosity, and out-of-the-box thinking in the young kids who will be decision-making adults in a few years time.</p>
<p>White Dragon Paper, LLC started very small, but has continued to see steady annual growth in both annual revenue and community involvement.  I want to continue this trend, and having a Valley Paper Beater of my own would mean that no matter where I go in the future, I'll have what I need to continue the work of White Dragon Paper, and continue spreading the word about how wonderful recycled paper is.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks and the Game Plan</h3> <p>Our biggest risk is not meeting our goal.  Unfortunately you can't buy just a piece of this machine. In order to be able to take advantage of this unique bit of fortune, we need to raise all of the funds.  In order to meet our full goal, I am setting up this campaign as a ""home base"" at which donors and interested parties can track our progress.  Beyond the web though, I will be approaching individuals and groups that have been supportive or expressed interest in my work over the years, and talking to as many new people as will listen.  I will be utilizing social media such as Facebook (White Dragon Paper, LLC) and Twitter (@WhiteDragonPapr) to spread the word and reach more potential donors.  I try to think of it this way: At most, we need 4000 people to donate $1.  But if we can get everyone to donate $100, we only need 40.  So we need to get somewhere between 40 and 4000 people to contribute.  We can do that right?  I think so!</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> </div> <p>I understand if you just can't donate right now, but you can still be a crucial, massively helpful part of this campaign by using IndieGoGo's share tools to spread the word, and sharing my posts on Twitter (@WhiteDragonPapr) and Facebook (White Dragon Paper, LLC) as we move through this campaign.  Any support is welcomed.</p></div>","Back Story I'm Rocky, the owner of White Dragon Paper, LLC.    White Dragon Paper is a small business that started in 2007 when I got bored over the summer between semesters at my community college.  I started with about $20 worth of supplies from the thrift store and some internet tutorials.  Over the past 8 years I've gone from working out of a plastic tub in my basement to collaborating with other handmade paper artists, sharing studio space and equipment, and expanding my products to include hand bound books and stationary.  It's become a part time job that allows me to do the work I love and still get my bills paid.

 Vision
Paper is EVERYWHERE. It's so prevalent in our daily lives it becomes static in many people's minds.  When I tell people that I make paper, the most common assumption is that I make origami, or cards, or some other art using ready-made commercial papers.  I have to explain first that, yes I make cards and books, but first, before anything else, I have to create the sheets of paper I am going to use.  Many people see paper as a medium on which to make art, not a medium out of which art can be made.  I like to challenge that notion by focusing on the paper itself when making my art.  I want to reduce wasted paper and cardboard, give new life to old materials, make human connections through my work, and give back to the communities that have made White Dragon Paper what it is today.
Through White Dragon Paper I try to share this perspective with as many people as I can.  Exposing young kids to this idea early puts the idea into their head to question materials and art, and inspires them to use old materials in new ways.  Art fosters creativity, confidence, and curiosity.  I often talk to people who say they made paper in scouts or at school using dryer lint, or are familiar with paper mache.  Through White Dragon Paper, I want to follow up on these initial, basic exposures and teach people to look at paper that they were going to throw away, and think ""Who can use this?  Can I do something more with it?""
These expansions and collaborations have allowed me to do wonderful things, including expending my business products lines and giving back to the community. In the summer of 2014 I volunteered to teach paper-making to a camp full of kids who have or have had cancer, for a full week (and I'm excited to have been invited back this summer).  This year I've been contacted by some local libraries to teach recycled paper arts to their teens.
So why have I started this campaign?
I am currently renting the use of a Reina paper beater from one of my studio roommates.  The Reina paper beater is a particular brand of Hollander beater, a machine that churns recycled office paper, cardboard, or plant fibers up into a mush that can then be used to make sheets of new paper.  New, these machines cost upwards of $9000 depending on the model and size.  Some sell for $16k.  Finding these machines used is like finding a blue lobster.  It happens, but people tend to hang on to their paper beaters as long as they can because there aren't many of them made, they're expensive, and they're easier to repair than replace if they break down.  When a used beater does pop up for sale, the seller has their pick of offers.

All of our perks will put in your hands something that embodies the core principles of White Dragon Paper, LLC.  They will include paper hand made by me from 100% recycled materials and books made with recycled, upcycled, and scrap materials.
Perks include a hand written thank you card, book key chains, a personal journal/sketchbook, and gift packs of various handmade papers, books, and recycled paper items.
Of course, there is the risk that we won't meet our funding goal.  Should we fall vastly short and only raise a few hundred dollars, we will used the accrued funds to purchase more materials to donate toward our volunteer service at the camp this summer.  We already volunteer a week of our time, as well as certain equipment, but the camp organizers purchase all the consumable materials we need for the week such as fiber, wood, and dye.  If we make it half way or should we fall just a few hundred dollars shy of our goal, we will look into additional sources of donations to cover the gap after the IndieGoGo campaign has ended.

<p>This collection focuses on childhood favorites from the first two generations of the Poke mon games. I named the collection ""Ace Trainer"" because I chose Pokemon that you would encounter from Ace Trainers (NPC's that you battle) in the game - mostly in or on your way to Victory Road. These are fully evolved and more commonly used 'mons for battle. I wanted to make them look fierce and powerful but still cute at the same time. I also made sure to choose one mon of each type! ♥</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The art of gigposter design is a genre in and of itself; however, its merits are often denied. It's a blind task, illustrating a show that has yet to be seen, to fit a tone that hasn't been set. What was once an incentive for fans to leave a concert, now causes those fans to swarm the merch table after; it's a diverse art form melding music and imagery. A solid poster not only encapsulates the experience of a fantastic show, but solidifies the memory. </p>
<p>We rarely get such a solid exhibition of East coast gigposter designers in our area, and it's such a shame, seeing that New York and the East coast in general have so much talent to offer.  This gallery will highlight some of that amazing talent, showing beautiful posters created for incredibly talented bands by amazing artists; the artists we chose to highlight will showcase various different styles of poster design from several different genres of music.</p>
<p>In keeping with the DIY spirit of gigposter design, this exhibition will be held at a local print studio in Gowanus Brooklyn.  If inspiration should strike you, you'll have the opportunity to take classes teaching you the basics of screen-printing!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why Donate?</h3>
<p>Donating funds keeps this show free to the public; we want to get as many people in the doors as possible so they can witness this exciting and vast (although often overlooked) genre of artwork.</p>
<p>All funds will go to renting out the space for the gallery, hanging the work, refreshments, and any relevant shipping costs.  Poster sales go to the artist.</p>
<p>Poster shows are not entirely common in New York, and it's important that we establish a presence in this community as well as show the general public that the art of gigposter design is an exciting and broad genre!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Times are tough, if you can't contribute please spread the word and help us reach our goal!  And, of course, come on out to the show on June 22nd 2012!</p>

<p><a href=""http://creationsforcharity.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Creations for Charity</a> is an annual fundraising event to give new and official Lego sets to underprivileged children during the holidays.</p>
<p>We have a unique way of doing this. We raise money by selling custom Lego creations made by Lego builders from all over the world. Since 2009, we raised about $17,000 and donated over 1,100 brand new Lego sets to organizations like Toys for Tots, Make-A-Wish, and childrens hospitals across multiple cities in the US.</p>
<p>This year we are expanding our donations to two countries outside the US: Chile and Croatia, and we need a lot more funds to buy enough Lego to make this happen. This is why we launched this campaign.</p>
<h2>
<br/>What we need and what you get:</h2>
<p>When you make a donation or <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/store.asp?p=C4C"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">purchase a custom Lego creation</a>, you will help us buy new and official Lego sets for the children. If the feeling of knowing that you have brightened the holidays of a child in need isn't enough, then check out these incentives:</p>

<h2>Where does the money go?</h2>
<p>A small portion of our funds goes towards making these awesome thank-you gifts you just saw, and the rest is used to buy Lego for the kids. We have distribution coordinators in our donation areas who will be scouting out the biggest sales on Lego so we get the most bricks for our buck. We typically buy Lego sets at more than 40% off!</p>
<p>We donate the Lego sets to organizations that specialize in distributing toys to children in need. They include Toys for Tots, Make-A-Wish, childrens hospitals, and orphanages. This year, we will be donating in Chicago, Dallas, Grand Rapids, Los Angeles, Chile, and Croatia.</p>
<h2>Why is this important?</h2>
<p>It's hard to find a kid who doesn't like Lego, but some have never owned a Lego set or much of other toys. When we give Lego, we give a toy that sparks the imagination and provides endless possibilities of play. You may have fond memories of yourself growing up playing with Lego, and if so, be thankful. We would like to see more children growing up with these memories.</p>

<p>     Fitchburg Artistree started as a simple idea and grew into something bigger in only 8 months. Created by artists, we just wanted a place to create and display our art and interact with one another. As time grew on we realized we weren’t the only ones who felt this way. We planted the seed, started to branch out, and began to realize what kind of impact we could truly have on this wonderful city of ours. We are a group of students, recent college graduates and community members, and where we don't collectively have a lot of money to pursue this mission of ours, we ask you simply for your help.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>     Fitchburg, MA was once a booming city with a busy downtown. Like many other cities in New England, Fitchburg has seen much better days. There are several empty storefronts along our 2-mile downtown area, and a pretty rough reputation. The dilapidation is not a fitting image for a community like ours. We have countless talented artists and musicians as well as dedicated, culturally diverse community members who love Fitchburg. It is our goal to use this money not only to sustain ourselves as Fitchburg Artistree, for our artists and our community, but also to help the economic recovery of our city and potentially be deemed a cultural district of Massachusetts. </p>
<div> </div>
<p>     Funding is extremely important to reaching our full potential. <span>Because we have been sustainable solely on small donations/admission at the door during our shows, we needed to have a fundraiser to go beyond just being able to pay for rent, utilities, insurance and compensating bands based on what we make during a show. We have a lot of improvements and a few small things that need fixing around the space, and where we're fortunately paying less for rent than what the space is supposedly worth, our landlord won't be putting any extra expenses into it. It's all on us. We also strive to purchase and install proper gallery lighting, paint a few murals in the space, and get a legitimate sign for out front. One of our most important things we're fundraising for is a house PA system. <span>They can be pretty pricy, but as a part music venue it's imperative we purchase one in the near future so we no longer have to borrow equipment from musicians that we know.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>     Aside from these essentials, we'd love to go above and beyond. We want to begin community mural projects throughout the city. We've talked with Cleghorn Neighborhood Center about designing and creating a mural with their youth center in their neighborhood with local artists. We believe this pop of color and meaningful depictions of our city and community would bring a great deal of positive energy. We would also use funding for planning and implementing community festivals in our parks, which would include live music from local musicians, live art demos, activities for all ages, and participation from local businesses and restaurants.</span></span></p>
<p>    We just want to be able to remain sustainable, providing art and music for the community. Everyone that puts this together is strictly volunteering. None of us ever get paid, but that's okay. We're not doing it for money. We do this because we enjoy it and we believe in our mission. We look at Artistree as a great opportunity in all aspects for many people; an outlet for creative expression, cultural exploration, building experience and a resume in the field of business, art, communication, and so many more fields. </p>

<p>In celebration of the 5th anniversary of the Black Rock French Quarter, we are creating something unique. We want to bring back the spirit of earlier Burning Man, when the richest experiences were found not at some established location on the Esplanade or the big audio wings, but out in the <i><b>deep playa</b></i>.</p>
<p>Our new project is a <i><b>miniature village</b></i>, surrounded by a <i><b>night market</b></i>, complete with coffee house, bakery, jazz, bar, and other amenities, that roams the deep playa, location always unknown. The experience is completely immersive, featuring performers in costume, as well as a look and sound unlike anything else at Burning Man. At the core of the village is a vehicle designed to deploy this experience for brief visits at different points around the city, and then pack it up and move it someplace else under cover of darkness. Our roving village and night market can be found through decoding <i><b>secret messages</b></i> broadcast on the radio, through special tracking devices that react when we are near, or through blind luck.<br/></p>
<h3>Story</h3>
<p>The year is 1799. The War of Independence concluded 16 years ago. 
Napoleon is marching through Egypt. The War of 1812 looms 13 years in 
the future. The new republic stands proud, but the future is uncertain, 
as the mighty nations of Europe battle across the four corners of the 
globe.</p>
<p>Radical voices are heard in the parlors and bars of New Orleans. The 
Earth is nothing more than a bloody chessboard for kings, emperors, and 
sultans, to whom the lives and freedoms of the common man mean nothing. 
If the liberty of the American states is to be preserved, it must find 
refuge beyond the reach of warring empires.</p>

</p><h3>Vehicle</h3>
<p>Our vehicle is an auspicious (and oddly Masonic) 33 feet long, cobbled together from pieces of a fanciful French Quarter of the year 1799. Its engines are powered by a reaction of absinthe and champagne, and it is carried through space by an array of <i><b>whirligigs</b></i> operating on principles long since forgotten. Amid the jumble of mismatched wrought iron balconies and shuttered windows, fly the banners and signs of the citizens and businesses that took flight from this Earth in search of freedom. As visitors stroll the top deck, admiring the view of the open night above our village, they are serenaded by a <i><b>vintage player piano</b></i> in full view. On the front of the vehicle, the first thing one sees as it approaches through the dusty dark, is a beautiful face, looking towards our destiny, with her eyes always closed.</p><p></p><p></p>

<h2>What is an artist residency?</h2>
<p>
It is a place an artist can go for an extended period (1 month or more) to work on a project or body of work without distraction.

Help us build an artist retreat center in The Bahamas.

It will be the first of its kind in The Bahamas, providing resources to:


Visiting artists
Local Bahamian artists
Local school students

To build the first bungalow with studio! 
One bungalow will allow us to launch an artist residency program at the end of 2014.
$50,000 = 1 single story bungalow that can house 2 artists or 2 couples during a stay. 1 artist's stay is 30 days. 10 stays in one year = 20 artists or couples. 
What are stretch goals?
Our project has several phases. Our first goal of $50k buys just 1 artist bungalow. Stretch goals can grow Exnihilo Art Center to have the greatest impact on the community. More bungalows, workshop space, and a Gathering House with a Public Gallery. 
Each stretch goal that is reached will allow us to increase the number of artist's residencies we can award. PLUS it allows us to unlock more PERKS like A STAY  in the bungalow. We must reach the first stretch goal before being able to offer a stay on the island.
Here is a breakdown of what each stretch goal buys and who is impacted...
$100,000 = 2 story bungalow that can house 4 artists or 4 couples.


$150,000 = 2 story bungalow that can house 4 artists or 4 couples. Plus a teaching workshop that will bring art to the local school students.
$250,000 = 2-2 story bungalows that can house 8 artists or 8 couples. Plus a teaching workshop that will bring art to the local school students.

$500,000 = 2-2 story bungalows that can house 8 artists or 8 couples. Plus The Gathering House with teaching workshops, gallery, recording studio & public dining.

We already have artists from around the world on a WAITING LIST. Your support will get this thing built and will help those artists.

We also have local artists and schools on the island waiting with great anticipation for all the creative opportunities Exnihilo will bring. Your support will bring art to those schools.
Clean up the island. One of the first programs Exnihilo will launch is JUNK-A-NEW. A recycling program that takes old rusty and abandoned vehicles that litter the island and resources them for sculptors to create art. Your support will clean up the island while making art.

What is an artist residency?

It is a place an artist can go for an extended period (1 month or more) to work on a project or body of work without distraction. Many major works through history have been produced in these locations. Learn more…

We are Blair & Bryan, professional artists with a desire to empower other artists. We feel a little shy about tooting our own horn, but Indiegogo says we should, so you can learn more about all the stuff we have done here.


We are fortunate to have some very talented advisors on our development team. All at the top of their game, they are artists, musicians, writers, even an oceanography expert! You can meet them here.
You are the most important part of the next phase of this project. You are a friend, colleague or family member who have watched us diligently work away at this project from its beginning.
You are someone who we encouraged in your development or even introduced you to your art form. You are someone we nurtured and mentored. You are someone who’s life we have impacted in some way. 
You are that special person who just happened upon this campaign and is inspired to make the dream of art a reality for island schoolchildren.
 We have taken this as far as we can without help. The next part is up to you.

Whether or not you contribute to this campaign, a BIG way you can help us is to SHARE THIS LINK:http://igg.me/at/exnihilo/x/2116915

Post it to your Facebook wall, tweet about it, email your friends, send messengers on horseback, whatever your thing is. The more networks we can reach, the better we do!

By helping build Exnihilo you are accomplishing something that will help hundreds of artists for years to come, as well as bringing art education to an underserved generation of students.
Perks include some great handmade art and up to a one week stay on the island.
Your contribution is tax deductible.


""Perks"" are what you get for your contribution. (if you choose to support the project but do not want a ""perk"" we have those options for you.) Because Exnihilo is an art center, we have some unique and handmade gifts as well as some island exclusives. (Upper right of page) Here is what they look like...

Minister of Education, 2012To access our detailed proposal go to the ""Gallery"" tab on this campaignWe are Alexa and Patrick, partners in life and partners in art. Together we travel the world making art and painting huge outdoor walls, and after many art projects in the arctic, Nunavut and Nunavik by far continue to be the most inspiring places for us. Past successful projects in the North can be found here:http://www.flickr.com/photos/patrickevoke/sets/72157640390721495/ We are very humbled to have been invited to Cape Dorset, Nunavut to paint a large outdoor mural on the hamlet's co-op building and collaborate with local artists. We will spend two months in town hosting art workshops for youth and creating the mural. 

a series of youth workshops led by
     Thompson and Hatanaka: techniques, brainstorming/ concept development,
     mural basics, intro to contemporary mural art practices
a series of youth workshops that will culminate in ten youth painting eight wildlife-proof garbage bins located around town
Northern News:http://www.nnsl.com/frames/newspapers/2012-07/jul23_12art.htmlWe will arrive in Cape Dorset on April 16th and wrap up the mural by the of June.Cape Dorset is an Inuit hamlet located on Dorset Island near Foxe Peninsula at the southern tip of Baffin Island. Sculptures have been carved in the arctic for thousands of years, but Cape Dorset and specifically Kinngait Studio, has been the centre of contemporary art in the arctic since the 1950s, producing world renowned original prints, carvings and drawings. The history of contemporary art in Cape Dorset: ://www.cbc.ca/player/Digital+Archives/Arts+and+Entertainment/Visual+Arts/ID/2412768717/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq6yq_SCyOIhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Dorsethttp://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/nunavut/part-3-cape-dorset/article651262/

It is cold and dark for many months of the year, colour and
imagination brings warmth to a frequented space in town.

Public art is a significant part of creating healthy cities
worldwide including Canada in a big way: why not in Cape Dorset, a place that
gives so much creatively to Canada and the world? 
Artistic exchange amongst Canadian artists

We have done many previous precedent setting murals in the
arctic that continue to be appreciated in their respective communities


Connect with young artists, contribute to inspiring the next generation of Cape Dorset artists which is currently a challenge: 

http://www.cbc.ca/thecurrent/episode/2011/08/24/etched-in-stone-documentary/


We have support from the Ontario
Arts Council and First Air for flights and a portion of our cargo                                                  


Alexa: I am volunteering to do this project as
an aside to fulfilling a Chalmer’s Fellowship (my visit to Cape Dorset is
supported by the Ontario Arts Council to experience the town and inform my
career’s trajectory) 
We are the humble guests of the Kinngait Lithography studio apartment (accommodation is a major piece, many thanks)              

We are donating our original prints as perks for your support!           


Your support is needed to cover materials, cargo
shipment, dangerous goods packaging (required to put paint on a plane), and
artist honorariums for Patrick and two local artists                   

Our campaign represents a modest budget for such
a project to ensure we meet our goal, surplus funding will go towards higher
artist honorariums and supplementing the high cost of food, and potentially painting additional walls (update we have already exceeded our estimated materials and shipping budget!)

<p></p></div>","About Us:
Chutzpah is an art gallery and coffee shop that encourages people to look at art, coffee, and life in general from a different perspective. We are dedicated to promoting artists and other creative professionals who have a passion for their work, while educating the public about all forms of art, music and coffee culture.
Chutzpah is run by Ian Morris and K Mikael Schnyder. Ian has run Homemade Genius, a successful music and arts nonprofit organization in upstate South Carolina, for the last 8 years.  Homemade Genius will continue to operate alongside Chutzpah to bring progressive music and art to Charleston. Mikael is a Southeast Regional Barista competitor with 12 years of coffee management experience, 2 years of coffee roasting experience and 6 years of coffee retailer experience. Together, they are teaming up to bring Charleston a new and exciting place to view and create art and music while enjoying a delicious cup of coffee in an inviting, relaxing atmosphere.
We know there is a need in the Charleston art scene for something different. In our gallery we will work hard to create a space that incorporates street art, outsider art and modern contemporary art, alongside progressive realism. We want to establish a true community of artists and art lovers alike. In our gallery, we will show a variety of progressive, modern artwork, by both promising up-and-coming artists and established artists. By taking only a 25% commission on all sales, we want to truly encourage and support the artists. 
 
Mission Statement: Chutzpah is defined as shameless audacity and fearlessness. To be a creative professional in today’s world, one must possess these traits. At Chutzpah, we are committed to supporting and promoting the hard-working, passionate artists in Charleston and beyond. With our art gallery and coffee shop, we provide the community with a place to create, learn about and appreciate progressive art, coffee, music and more. 
 

What We Need & What You Get
We've got the chutzpah to follow our dreams and the knowledge and experience to make it happen, but what we need now is funding. That's where you fine people come in.
We are aiming to raise $10,000, in order to help us secure a lease, build our coffee bar, purchase coffee shop and gallery equipment, and begin providing Charleston with a unique art gallery and cafe.
For your donation, you will get a variety of perks depending on the amount your donate.

<p>RAPID PULSE International Performance Art Festival presents a vast range of styles and forms of time-based work. Produced by Defibrillator Gallery in the Noble Square neighborhood of Chicago, Rapid Pulse will exhibit live performances by 24 international, national, and local artists who were invited by the curatorial committee or selected from an international call for proposals. Rapid Pulse also includes public interventions, a video series, social events, artist talks, and panel discussions. Spilling over to other venues in the neighborhood, the festival embraces the local and the global simultaneously. We aim to invigorate Chicago by bringing to the city artists of exceptional calibre from around the world. Dynamic programming, decidedly fearless and unique, aims to provoke thought and stimulate discourse surrounding performance art. </p>
<p>Visit <a href=""http://www.rapidpulse.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>www.RAPIDPULSE.org</span></a> for more information </p>
<p>Your contributions will go toward housing and feeding 26 local, national, and international artists. Often visiting artists go to great expense in order to participate in a festival - paying for their own airfare and missing out on employment. The least we can do is make sure they are comfortable and well-fed while they are here. Your help is invaluable. </p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Hi, I’m Andy, an artist living in Edinburgh, Scotland. I loved painting from an early age and studied fine art and graphic design at Edinburgh College of Art. Now, as Kurt Schwitters said, I nail my pictures together! I use recycled scrap metal and experiment with other materials like concrete and plastic to create unique mounted assemblage pieces. My work has been accepted into major Scottish exhibitions by the <a href=""http://www.s-s-a.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SSA</a> and <a href=""http://www.royalscottishacademy.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">RSA</a>.</span><br/></p>
<p>I’ve been invited to exhibit my work in a showcase in Taipei, Taiwan by the artist and gallery director, Yosifu. It will be my first major international exhibition, so it’s hugely important for my career. It will be the second time I have exhibited alongside Yosifu, whose work is celebrated in Taiwan. It will build on my collaboration with <a href=""http://www.qmu.ac.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Queen Margaret University</a> whose cultural management students (from Taiwan) have really opened up a dialogue about my art with an Asian audience for the first time. And, finally, it will complete the fantastic creative journey I have had with filmmaker Michal Korzonek who has spent many months filming the making of my work for a documentary.<br/></p>

<h3>Our Mission</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>Dispoze is a creative collaboration of Chicago’s newest and freshest artists. Our passionate staff aims to deliver a snapshot of urban lifestyle to our readers....and Dispoze is that lifestyle. </p>
<p>Heavily focused on music, fashion and art, our quarterly magazine aims to be not only Chicago’s premier art &amp; culture magazine, but also to be ranked nationally. Because Dispoze is our passion, our first focus will always remain on our invigorating brand and captivating content. </p>
<p>We have a staff of almost 30 dedicated and passionate young artists. From writers to photographers to designers, we have every inch of our vision covered and we know exactly what we need to get there.</p>
<p>Some of our short-term (within this next year) goals include: </p> <ul>
<li>Hosting events throughout the year, including our launch party, a quarterly weekend-long pop up shop, concerts, film festivals, local events, brand releases, and more.</li>
<li>Hitting an online circulation of 50,000 and a print circulation of 5,000 by the release of Issue 3.</li> <li>Developing our merchandise line into products our generation will love, helping to spread our brand and vision.</li>
<li>Developing an online presence in the blogosphere, ranging from interview videos to event coverage.</li>
<li>Getting Dispoze on the shelves of local businesses we support, and developing partnerships with businesses - particularly clothing brands, record labels and event venues.</li> </ul>
<div>
<p>Some of our long-term goals include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Opening up our own office, with a creative environment and plenty of space to throw events.</li>
<li>Hitting an online circulation of 150,000 and a print circulation of 15,000 by the release of Issue 6. </li>
<li>Seeing Dispoze on the shelves of major retailers.</li>
<li>Developing and cultivating a devoted fan base. </li>
<li>Build upon our existing staff with the addition of new, creative artists -- and hopefully, paying them!</li>
<li>Opening up our own storefront in downtown Chicago, then branching out to other top markets.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>We are already well on our way to achieve each and every one of these goals, and after just a few weeks, we've already managed to lock interviews with big names such as RCA Record's G-Eazy, who recently opened up for the Drake vs. Lil Wayne tour and hit #3 on Billboard charts with his summer album. His massive following will help fuel our e-zine sales and increase our circulation. We are networking more than ever before, and establishing personal relationships and connections with some of Chicago's finest. </p>

</div></div>","Our Mission 

Dispoze is a creative collaboration of Chicago’s newest and freshest artists. Our passionate staff aims to deliver a snapshot of urban lifestyle to our readers....and Dispoze is that lifestyle. 
Heavily focused on music, fashion and art, our quarterly magazine aims to be not only Chicago’s premier art & culture magazine, but also to be ranked nationally. Because Dispoze is our passion, our first focus will always remain on our invigorating brand and captivating content. 
We have a staff of almost 30 dedicated and passionate young artists. From writers to photographers to designers, we have every inch of our vision covered and we know exactly what we need to get there.
Some of our short-term (within this next year) goals include:  
Hosting events throughout the year, including our launch party, a quarterly weekend-long pop up shop, concerts, film festivals, local events, brand releases, and more.
Hitting an online circulation of 50,000 and a print circulation of 5,000 by the release of Issue 3. Developing our merchandise line into products our generation will love, helping to spread our brand and vision.
Developing an online presence in the blogosphere, ranging from interview videos to event coverage.
Getting Dispoze on the shelves of local businesses we support, and developing partnerships with businesses - particularly clothing brands, record labels and event venues. 

Some of our long-term goals include: 

Opening up our own office, with a creative environment and plenty of space to throw events.
Hitting an online circulation of 150,000 and a print circulation of 15,000 by the release of Issue 6. 
Seeing Dispoze on the shelves of major retailers.
Developing and cultivating a devoted fan base. 
Build upon our existing staff with the addition of new, creative artists -- and hopefully, paying them!
Opening up our own storefront in downtown Chicago, then branching out to other top markets.


We are already well on our way to achieve each and every one of these goals, and after just a few weeks, we've already managed to lock interviews with big names such as RCA Record's G-Eazy, who recently opened up for the Drake vs. Lil Wayne tour and hit #3 on Billboard charts with his summer album. His massive following will help fuel our e-zine sales and increase our circulation. We are networking more than ever before, and establishing personal relationships and connections with some of Chicago's finest. 


The Specifics
Print: A 9x12, 96 page magazine with 100# offset cover and 60# offset pages, done in full color and with perfect binding, plus gold foil accents for the cover. This gives the magazine a beautiful, ""coffee table"" look. E-Zine: Launched through Issuu.com, we will be able to provide the same content to thousands of readers around the world. Issuu.com tracks statistics and page views, so we'll be able to take the data to future advertisers.


Our Launch

We've already locked several performers, including Chicago's St. Millie along with Columbia College's own, Cae Jones. We've also locked a DJ. We'd like to blow up some of our photography and hang it, as well as sell our merchandise. We'd also like to be able to give away promotional items, such as stickers and lighters. The venue would be near downtown Chicago.

The official date for the launch party is December 4th, 2014.
   What We Need
Our first issue publishes on December 1, 2014. Most of the funding for business expenses and printing costs is coming from advertisers, but we need your help for that final push to help make Dispoze everything we want it to be. We are asking for $8,500, and here's why: 
Most advertising budgets are slim in the final quarter of the year, as they've already exhausted most of their funds. $8,500 will cover all of the costs to print, giving us a beautiful product to take to businesses at the start of the new calendar year.  Although we are still actively searching for advertisers, and have secured a few, we want to market and focus on our brand identity, which involves developing and distributing merchandise before we even release our first issue.
Excess funds will go towards web hosting fees, new equipment, and our launch party. We've already almost exhausted our personal funds -- and the first rule of business is that it takes money to make money! 

  Your Impact Your contribution will ensure that Dispoze becomes a reality. Here are some of the spots in our budget that we'd love to spend more on: 
Print quality.
Marketing - adding stickers, posters and advertisements in other medias. Maintaining our website and adding more interaction between the site and the viewer.
External hard drives. Staff - we've got almost 30 people working for free as of right now, and one of our ultimate goals is to make money doing what we love! 


  Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help: 
Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about Dispoze!

<h3>Who am I and what is this campaign all about?</h3>
<p>My name is Gina Santi and I am a photographer, anthropologist, and educator. I am producing a 2014 wall calendar for CASA -the Center for Adolescents in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico- to be sold as a fundraiser for the organization. I am providing my images and design skills free of charge but am in need of contributions to cover printing costs.</p>
<p>CASA is a 30-year-old grassroots, youth-driven organization that proudly serves 80,000 people a year all over Mexico through its community and education advocacy efforts: maternity hospital and family clinic, professional midwifery school, day care programs, libraries, theater group, and violence prevention programs. I encourage you to see the attached video in its entirety to better visualize the scope of activities that your contribution will reach.</p>
<h3>What do I need?</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>The cost of printing one calendar is US$18.00 and this campaign is based on 100 calendars. I need a total of US$1,800. They will be 12-month 2014 wall calendars, printed on heavy archival quality stock, individually signed by the artist, and in limited edition. The retail price of the calendar will be US$35.00 and it will be sold among CASA's constituency during other fundraising events in the Fall of 2013.</p>
<p>If this campaign is fully funded, CASA will receive US$3,500 that will go towards its many community programs :-)</p>
<p>100 calendars x US$35 = US$3,500</p>
<p>Any donation amount is greatly appreciated!! Of course, if we receive more of your generous donations we will be able to print more calendars and therefore more money will go toward's CASA programs.</p>
<p>Regardless of how much money is raised for this campaign, 100% of the donations will go to CASA. Gina Santi Photography is not keeping even one cent!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please help us spread out the word!! Post this campaign on your facebook wall, tell your family and friends, and please reach into your pockets and contribute to this worthy cause. You can help make the lives of those less fortunate a little easier.</p>

<h3>Empower Others Through Art</h3>
<p>Picasso believed that we are all born artists, and 21inc's 21Leader Vanessa Paesani agrees.  She will be working with the clients (artists) of the Restigouche Hospital Centre in Campbellton in February 2013; clients will create art to make creative, client-generated hallways spaces.</p>
<p>This project arises from the belief that everyone is an artist and the process of making, and subsequently displaying, art is an empowering process.  Read more about 21inc's 21Leaders here: <a href=""http://www.21inc.ca/2012-21leaders-nb.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.21inc.ca/2012-21leaders-nb.html</a>.</p>

<p>
</p><p>In 2013 bookdummypress, an independent bookstore &amp; a publisher in New York and Reminders Photography Stronghold, a gallery in Tokyo joined forces to launch an international photography publication award to celebrate the newsprint’s contribution to the evolving creativity of self-publishing. </p><p>Newsprint is not only an economical medium that allow a range of experimentation, but also has the potential of reaching a diverse audience wider and faster.

<p>There were many interesting works, beautiful works and works that made me curious. I saw new talents from upcoming photographers. However, one question that came up in my mind is, how many of them actually thought about the final presentation format? Each work could be interesting and beautiful, or each image could be striking. But newsprint is the medium for this award. All the elements such as layout, image size and image quality would be very different from making a photobook. Simply you cannot rely on the print quality. When you apply to an award like this, it has to be more than taking pictures and uploading the files. You have to consider what kind of format you work with and try to output your idea accordingly. I feel like there were many potential applicants if they had been thought through and worked on it a bit further. </p>

In 2013 bookdummypress, an independent bookstore & a publisher in New York and Reminders Photography Stronghold, a gallery in Tokyo joined forces to launch an international photography publication award to celebrate the newsprint’s contribution to the evolving creativity of self-publishing. Newsprint is not only an economical medium that allow a range of experimentation, but also has the potential of reaching a diverse audience wider and faster. Keeping this award open to photographers / artists without any entry fee, it is intended to stimulate to take a renew approach towards this format and to introduce photographers to a way to self-publish and self-distribute their work. 2013年にニューヨークで出版社とブックストアを運営するbookdummypressと、東京でギャラリーと写真総合施設を運営するReminders Photography Strongholdが設立した国際写真賞です。賞を設立した目的は、ニュースプリントによって個人出版物の可能性を高める事です。  ニュースプリントは、実験的なことを試す事ができる経済的な媒体だけではなく、より広く、そしてより早く様々な人々に届ける事ができる可能性を持っています。  この賞は、写真家とアーティストたちへ開かれています。申し込み料金はかかりません。ニュースプリントというフォーマットへの新しいアプローチの方法、そして写真家達の作品の拡散を目的としています。Why do we ask for your support? / なぜ私達はサポートが必要なのか？:

2014 Winning Project / 2014年度受賞作品:
The 2014 winner, Noi Satirat Damampai (Thailand) portray the struggles of Karen ethnic group which is considered as the longest civil war in the world, in her award winning project “The War Within”. Unlike any other conflict the project is comprised of musing portraits and desolate landscape that show how intense but stale those lives have been through during the 60 years of fighting and fearing.
2014年度受賞者は、タイのフォトグラファーNoi Satirat Damampai。彼女は今回の受賞作”The War Within”で、世界で最も長く闘い続けるカレン族の姿を描写しています。他の内戦のプロジェクトと違い、この作品は瞑想的なポートレイトと荒涼とした風景写真で成り立っており、60年以上も続くこの争いがいかに過酷で生気がないものかを表している。 2014 Finalists:
“No Mans Land” by Norbert Goertz
“I’m Lost in the World” by Mito

A scientist and intrepid explorer is nothing without the tools of their trade to prove their theories.</p><p>I will be exploring light, sound and movement in the natural world which will require things such as prisms, motors, mirrors, light sensors and of course some recording equipment (both audio and visual).

A scientist and intrepid explorer is nothing without the tools of their trade to prove their theories.I will be exploring light, sound and movement in the natural world which will require things such as prisms, motors, mirrors, light sensors and of course some recording equipment (both audio and visual). I work in both digital and more traditional media so things such as photographic paper (for pinhole photography) also need accounting for.Above - The beautiful refractory patterns coming from the solid crystal, commemorative, Fire and Ice Expedition 'Ice Cube' which can be yours when you become my Quarter Master.All my work has been leading up to this artistic expedition so it seems fitting that I should offer some of my research in exchange for your support. So for instance, I offer you a signed limited edition print of one of my 'magnetic' drawings in exchange for the pledge of £45 and the privileged title of 'Lava Dodger'. If you just can't settle for anything less than an original drawing then a £200 pledge will get that in the bag as my 'Nordic Navigator'. Above - Work in progress of one of the large scale 'Magnetic Landscape' drawings on offer when you sign up for the 'Prince of Whales' perk.Take a look at the drawings available on either the gallery section of the campaign or on my flickr page here. Drawings on flickr New drawings are being added regularly so do keep your eyes peeled and when making a pledge make sure to specify the drawing you're after.Metal incarnation of one of my drawings from the 'magnetic' series, yours when you sign up to be my 'Top Geyser'.Magnetic DrawingsBecome a 'Quarter Master' and carry out your own experiments on light as we do in the field. A crystal 'Ice Cube' is yours for the taking...I also have limited edition porcelain and glass 'Ice Cubes', black and white C-type ice photography, studio visits and sacred geometry lessons, not forgetting abook of drawings to peruse at your leisure.C-type 'Ice' print.Limited Edition Porcelain and Glass 'Ice Cube'There are perks for everyone, from a postcard or Polaroid thank you, all the way up to a unique sculpture depicting the atomic structure of ice using porcelain and glass.'Ice' sculpture depicting the atomic structure of ice in porcelain and glass.The initial three months of my time in Iceland will be focused on exploring the landscape and researching possible sculptures, installations and artworks. So even if I'm unable to raise all of the funds necessary to execute all of the expansive ideas I have bubbling away, the money raised will at least help me to get to the stage of having the initial research to allow me to put together more detailed proposals and funding applications to organisations, institutions, galleries and funding bodies. This is the first step towards increasing the sustainability of my practice, allowing it to grow.The ImpactYour contribution to my expedition will allow me to share the awe inspiring natural phenomena the world has to offer. My practice blends art and science and it is my intention to make scientific notions more accessible to the general public. I will be collaborating with specialists in their field and through workshops, exhibitions and events I will not only teach but inspire people to ask questions, explore and encourage cross disciplinary collaboration.Above: Visuals from Gwyneth Herbert's Sea CabinetIn a recent project I made the move into time based, interactive work as a result of working with singer, composer, writer and producer Gwyneth
Herbert. This irrevocably developed my work in ways I could
never have imagined. It is this search into the unknown which I not only find spectacularly exciting but essential for progress in both art and science.Other Ways That You Can HelpIf you aren't able to make a donation never fear, you can still help. I ask you to share this project with as many people as possible. The more people who join the expedition the more discoveries we can make together. So please use the indiegogo share tools so we can make this expedition one to be proud of.",11.0,4,"3 Campaigns

From audience-curated programming to micro funding and sponsorships, the look and success of <span class=""caps"">SIFC</span> and our endeavors depends on the support and engagement of the creative community in and around Chicago.<br/>
_<br/>
We at Sixty Inches From Center are not trying to reinvent the wheel. We are looking for ways to strengthen the arts programs, artist collaboratives and creative practices or spaces that already exist and bring together the many different underground organizations, artists and collectives that are doing amazing things.  Our goal is to create new bridges and act as facilitators of collaboration in Chicago’s art scene.</p>

The Money Situation:  The truth of the matter is that if we want <span class=""caps"">SIFC</span> to function and be up and running in the best possible way, we need about $10,000.  We are asking for $3,600 because it is the minimal amount that it will take to launch <span class=""caps"">SIFC</span>.  Therefore, any way you can help would be very beneficial!<br/>

Our Team:  Our current team consists of 15 art historians, artists, writers, editors, filmmakers, web designers and graphic designers all working and living in the Chicagoland area. Our advisory board was chosen based on a combination of their investment in the Chicago art community, their own areas of art expertise and their unwavering support of our vision. They are educators, artists, directors of non-profit organizations, writers, art historians and filmmakers in new media.  <br/>
_<br/>
Why We Do What We Do and Why We Need You:  Our archiving project and launch campaign are our primary focuses when approaching IndieGoGo for funds.  While IndieGoGo offers an answer to the questions of where funds will come from to make these innovative projects happen, Sixty Inches From Center asks, “What happens to these events, artists and projects when they’re done?”  Many of the vanguard art practices happening locally, nationally and internationally are lost due to lack of proper documentation.   Many of the artists and movements missing from the top-used textbooks are absent from the art historical dialogue because that information wasn’t properly recorded.  Once the archive compiles a substantial amount of content, it will be serve as an educational tool locally and nationally, able to be studied and referenced.<br/>
_<br/>
Carrying Out Our Mission: With proper documentation also comes the need for the most cutting-edge and efficient technology.  Our team needs top-quality equipment that can easily tag along as we go to art events and artist studios, and then be uploaded to the website in a timely manner.  We don’t want our presence to be a big production at these events, or to overshadow the event or art itself.  Therefore, we need things such as Sanyo <span class=""caps"">VPC</span>-CG20 Dual HD 10MP Camcorders, <span class=""caps"">DSLR</span> <span class=""caps"">NEX</span>-5 cameras and Olympus WS 400S 1 GB Digital voice recorders for our team.  In order for these items to function correctly, we need other things such as memory cards, external hard drives and memory card readers. This will also allow each person on the team to cover video, audio and photography with only two very small and compact tools. <br/>
_<br/>
To address our concern with community engagement we are also raising funds for two other initiatives: the <span class=""caps"">SIFC</span> truck and <span class=""caps"">SIFC</span> traveling photo booth. <br/>
_<br/><span class=""caps"">SIFC</span> will purchase a vehicle to travel around Chicago creating temporary and explosive art events throughout the city.  The idea behind this is to 1) be a constant promotional tool for <span class=""caps"">SIFC</span>, 2) travel throughout the city and engage as many different communities as possible, and 3) offer constant collaborative art experiences with Chicago’s communities.  Instead of trying to get people to come to us, we will come to them in addition to partnering with art spaces around the city.  Also, artists will be encouraged to propose ideas around this mobile curatorial tool.<br/>
_<br/>
The <span class=""caps"">SIFC</span> Photo Booth will also be a traveling initiative.  This hand-crafted booth will  travel along with us and be set up at different locations in an attempt to capture the faces behind Chicago’s art community.

<h3 class=""p1"">TIFF 2012 is the second edition of a new photography festival in Poland created by young people with energy and passion for photography. TIFF is meant to change it's formula every year in order to discover new possibilities of presenting photography. In 2012 edition invited artists will create an exhibition by working together in one place and at one time. This event will be transmitted online via our website and it's results will be shown during the festival's main weekend on November 8th to 11th. </h3>
<h3 class=""p1"">We created our program basing on what we believe is lacking in other similar events which is diversity and creativity. This festival is not only directed to people with extensive knowledge in photography, but also to people who had never participated in such events and who share a desire to see more and know more.</h3>
<h3 class=""p1"">We are aware that organizing TIFF 2012 with it's complex and eventful program is not an easy task but we believe that with your help we can do it. Contributing to this campaign you will not only help us make our dream come true, but you will also support young emerging artists who wait for a chance to present their work to the wider audience. Be a part of TIFF!</h3>
<p> </p>
<h2 class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong><strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.9329500936437398""></strong>Who Are We?</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><strong>""BLIK"" Foundation</strong> is a young non goverment organization, focused on visual education, that realises its purposes trough photography. Few of our projects were officially selected for the program of European Capital of Culture 2016 in Wroclaw.<strong> TIFF International Photography Festival</strong> is one of them. </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""> </span></p>
<h2 class=""p3""><span class=""s1""><strong>More about TIFF International Photography Festival</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">An idea of a TIFF has arrived with a dynamic growth of Wroclaw's culture. It seems like there is still not enough attention for the art of photography. In 2011, during the pilot edition of TIFF, this extremely daring desire to renew the influence of Wroclaw's artistic circles on Polish photography arose inside of us. With the birth of this festival we try to connect with a traditional photography output of Wroclaw which towards years affected the whole country, as well as neighbouring countries. We would like to resume this trend and become the catalyst for evolution of photography through various innovatory, fresh, and inspiring activities around photography and related arts, offered to local, artistic and academical circles.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><strong>Two major ways of 2012 edition are cooperation of Visegrad Group countries and ""Process in construction""</strong>. First subject is a trial of a battle with a lack of thought exchange between Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary, which we have noticed lately. ""Process in construction"" is an idea inspired by the dynamic of modern world. We have decided that this years form is going to be focused on construction, bottom-up actions, establishing new standards and ownerships. Moreover, in a response to the modern issue of existence between the virtual and real world, we would like to report the wide part of festival actions in the real time, simultaneously on the Internet. That way we could give tools for active participation in these actions to the virtual receiver.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""> </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">This year <strong>TIFF</strong> consists of three major section: <strong>Main Program</strong>, where invited guests would work on common exhibition searching for new ways in artistic photography; <strong>Theoretical Section</strong>, based on media-lab form, by which theoretics from different countries would exchange directions of searching and development of theoretical thought around photography; <strong>Section of Publications</strong>, which would sum up and spread bottom-up actions, showing primary need of creation and express not only through the work, but also through the form of presentation. Additionally, under the TIFF wings we are planning to organize the review of the artistic Schools of Photography, Debut’s Presentation, and also Accompanying Exhibitions. All of it in November 2012.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
<h2 class=""p5""><span class=""s1""><strong>What Do We Need?</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p6""> </p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">The total budget of TIFF Festival is 83 000$. In this sum are:</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">cost of artist fees - 12 000$</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">costs of travel and accommodation 21 000$</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">production of exhibitions and preparing festival’s space 23 000$</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">promotion and publications 17 000$</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">translations 6 000$</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">cost of administration 4 000$</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""> </span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><strong>We hope to raise the campaign up to 50,000$. Revenues from tickets and gadgets are expected in a sum around 15 000$. We are still looking for private sponsors in Poland for another part of the amount. Please, partake in helping us! Even if you don't have money, you can help. Please share the link to this campaign on your Facebook or Twitter account or inform your friends in other ways :)</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""> </span></p>
<h2 class=""p5""><span class=""s1""><strong>The Impact</strong></span></h2>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">The attendance of the 1</span><span class=""s2""><sup>st</sup></span><span class=""s1""> Polish-German edition that approached 4000 viewers has proved a demand for a photo festival in Wroclaw. The program comprised 35h of workshops, 11 artist slide shows, 11 exhibitions, 2 concerts,3 debates, festival cinema: 4 film screenings and an all-Polish debut open call with 5 winners. All took place in 5 galleries in Wroclaw such as <span>WrocÅ‚aw Contemporary Museum</span>.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">The festival was under 10 official media auspices and appeared in all accessible media including dozens of articles, 3 TV broadcasts and 5 radio broadcasts. We have been granted a sponsorship by Goethe Institute and Council of Lower Silesia's Governor office.</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">TIFF is the 1</span><span class=""s2""><sup>st</sup></span><span class=""s1""> photography festival in Wroclaw and a rarity in Poland.  A month-long festival (Oct, 26th- Nov, 30</span><span class=""s2""><sup>th</sup></span><span class=""s1"">) will constitute 39 events, 1,000 publications, gather 70 artists from 7 countries and thousands of viewers. We are going to promote young, talented photographers, and give them opportunity to meet professional, hot name, photographers. <strong>We are propagating the idea of photography as an important way of contact with art. Due to this fact, we offer the festival to a very wide range of audience and the ticket are believed to cost approximately 7,25$ and will include entrance to all of the events, workshops and lectures.  </strong></span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><strong>We have many positive opinions from experts and potential viewers and that is why we are very excited about this year program. Here are some of them:</strong></span></p>
<div><strong><br/></strong></div>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><em>„[...]The level of photography and its presentation was very high and all exhibition openings were noticeable events in cultural calendar of Wroclaw. Each of three exhibitions had different curator’s idea which made the formula of it more interesting and also as a series of events gave an image of what are young photographers looking for in modern art (...). Having in mind great cooperation with creators of TIFF, and appreciating their work for reviving the photographic circles in Wroclaw (...), we would like to cooperate with festival during the next edition in november 2012 (...).”</em></span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><em>Dorota Monkiewicz, Director of <span>WrocÅ‚aw Contemporary Museum</span> (from the official support letter)</em></span></p>
<p class=""p7""> </p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><em>„To be one of </em>five winners of TIFF competition for young photographers „Debuts 2011” and the possibility to present my work to the wide audience, was my personal success. Being part of the festival gave me the possibility to promote my artistic work, but also to meet with public what was a big development for me and was very inspiring. Giving the opportunity to the young, active and talented, but still not promoted artists is a very good idea. I hope that thanks to such and other activities of TIFF Festival, work of less known photographers will be noticed and appreciated for the people not connected with photographic circles, and will help young artists in their careers in Poland and abroad.”</span></p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Joanna Ziajka, photographer <em>(from the official support letter)</em></span></p>
<p class=""p6""> </p>
<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><em>„BLIK is a dynamic and active foundation from Wroclaw, which we started to work with during the application for the European Capital of Culture.

TIFF 2012 is the second edition of a new photography festival in Poland created by young people with energy and passion for photography. TIFF is meant to change it's formula every year in order to discover new possibilities of presenting photography. In 2012 edition invited artists will create an exhibition by working together in one place and at one time. This event will be transmitted online via our website and it's results will be shown during the festival's main weekend on November 8th to 11th. 
We created our program basing on what we believe is lacking in other similar events which is diversity and creativity. This festival is not only directed to people with extensive knowledge in photography, but also to people who had never participated in such events and who share a desire to see more and know more.
We are aware that organizing TIFF 2012 with it's complex and eventful program is not an easy task but we believe that with your help we can do it. Contributing to this campaign you will not only help us make our dream come true, but you will also support young emerging artists who wait for a chance to present their work to the wider audience. Be a part of TIFF!
 
Who Are We?
""BLIK"" Foundation is a young non goverment organization, focused on visual education, that realises its purposes trough photography. Few of our projects were officially selected for the program of European Capital of Culture 2016 in Wroclaw. TIFF International Photography Festival is one of them. 
 
More about TIFF International Photography Festival
An idea of a TIFF has arrived with a dynamic growth of Wroclaw's culture. It seems like there is still not enough attention for the art of photography. In 2011, during the pilot edition of TIFF, this extremely daring desire to renew the influence of Wroclaw's artistic circles on Polish photography arose inside of us. With the birth of this festival we try to connect with a traditional photography output of Wroclaw which towards years affected the whole country, as well as neighbouring countries. We would like to resume this trend and become the catalyst for evolution of photography through various innovatory, fresh, and inspiring activities around photography and related arts, offered to local, artistic and academical circles.
Two major ways of 2012 edition are cooperation of Visegrad Group countries and ""Process in construction"". First subject is a trial of a battle with a lack of thought exchange between Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary, which we have noticed lately. ""Process in construction"" is an idea inspired by the dynamic of modern world. We have decided that this years form is going to be focused on construction, bottom-up actions, establishing new standards and ownerships. Moreover, in a response to the modern issue of existence between the virtual and real world, we would like to report the wide part of festival actions in the real time, simultaneously on the Internet. That way we could give tools for active participation in these actions to the virtual receiver.
 
This year TIFF consists of three major section: Main Program, where invited guests would work on common exhibition searching for new ways in artistic photography; Theoretical Section, based on media-lab form, by which theoretics from different countries would exchange directions of searching and development of theoretical thought around photography; Section of Publications, which would sum up and spread bottom-up actions, showing primary need of creation and express not only through the work, but also through the form of presentation. Additionally, under the TIFF wings we are planning to organize the review of the artistic Schools of Photography, Debut’s Presentation, and also Accompanying Exhibitions. All of it in November 2012.
 
What Do We Need?
 
The total budget of TIFF Festival is 83 000$. In this sum are:
cost of artist fees - 12 000$
costs of travel and accommodation 21 000$
production of exhibitions and preparing festival’s space 23 000$
promotion and publications 17 000$
translations 6 000$
cost of administration 4 000$
 
We hope to raise the campaign up to 50,000$. Revenues from tickets and gadgets are expected in a sum around 15 000$. We are still looking for private sponsors in Poland for another part of the amount. Please, partake in helping us! Even if you don't have money, you can help. Please share the link to this campaign on your Facebook or Twitter account or inform your friends in other ways :)
 
The Impact
The attendance of the 1st Polish-German edition that approached 4000 viewers has proved a demand for a photo festival in Wroclaw. The program comprised 35h of workshops, 11 artist slide shows, 11 exhibitions, 2 concerts,3 debates, festival cinema: 4 film screenings and an all-Polish debut open call with 5 winners. All took place in 5 galleries in Wroclaw such as WrocÅ‚aw Contemporary Museum.
The festival was under 10 official media auspices and appeared in all accessible media including dozens of articles, 3 TV broadcasts and 5 radio broadcasts. We have been granted a sponsorship by Goethe Institute and Council of Lower Silesia's Governor office.
TIFF is the 1st photography festival in Wroclaw and a rarity in Poland.  A month-long festival (Oct, 26th- Nov, 30th) will constitute 39 events, 1,000 publications, gather 70 artists from 7 countries and thousands of viewers. We are going to promote young, talented photographers, and give them opportunity to meet professional, hot name, photographers. We are propagating the idea of photography as an important way of contact with art. Due to this fact, we offer the festival to a very wide range of audience and the ticket are believed to cost approximately 7,25$ and will include entrance to all of the events, workshops and lectures.  
We have many positive opinions from experts and potential viewers and that is why we are very excited about this year program. Here are some of them:

„[...]The level of photography and its presentation was very high and all exhibition openings were noticeable events in cultural calendar of Wroclaw. Each of three exhibitions had different curator’s idea which made the formula of it more interesting and also as a series of events gave an image of what are young photographers looking for in modern art (...). Having in mind great cooperation with creators of TIFF, and appreciating their work for reviving the photographic circles in Wroclaw (...), we would like to cooperate with festival during the next edition in november 2012 (...).”
Dorota Monkiewicz, Director of WrocÅ‚aw Contemporary Museum (from the official support letter)
 
„To be one of five winners of TIFF competition for young photographers „Debuts 2011” and the possibility to present my work to the wide audience, was my personal success. Being part of the festival gave me the possibility to promote my artistic work, but also to meet with public what was a big development for me and was very inspiring. Giving the opportunity to the young, active and talented, but still not promoted artists is a very good idea. I hope that thanks to such and other activities of TIFF Festival, work of less known photographers will be noticed and appreciated for the people not connected with photographic circles, and will help young artists in their careers in Poland and abroad.”
Joanna Ziajka, photographer (from the official support letter)
 
„BLIK is a dynamic and active foundation from Wroclaw, which we started to work with during the application for the European Capital of Culture. From the beginning we met with big engagement from their site, which was proved by applying with many ambitious cultural projects, and also by active work on promoting wroclaw’s candidature.”

<p><strong><em>Our Existing Business is Great - but we want more and this is what we are going to do about it....</em></strong></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Boston Body Art Studio &amp; Gallery</h2>
<h4 style=""text-align: center;"">A Hybrid Body Art Modification Studio &amp; Commission-Free Art Gallery for the City's Art Students' in the Center of Boston.  </h4>
<p align=""left"">The Body Art Studio will employ only the best in their craft offering tattoos, body piercing and eventually permanent makeup.  The Gallery will gather it's artwork from local art students &amp; artists looking to get into, or advancing in, the Art Community.  The space is so large, we couldn't not put one in and will still have room for retail.  <em><strong>Unlike other galleries though we will already have a fully functioning business to cover the overhead, so 100% of the money from art sales will go directly into the (student) Artist's pocket.</strong></em>  We feel it will be the perfect hybrid, continually drawing inspiration from one another.    </p>
<p align=""left"">     But our Campaign's success is dependent on the community, who will decide if this is something they want for their community.  No matter if this Campaign is successful or not the shop will still open, but we are hoping this works (hint, hint.....)</p>

 You're Probably Asking Yourself-</h3>
<h3 align=""center""><em>""Why The Hell Would They Give Away Free Time on Tattoos?""</em></h3>
<p>Well that's simple.  Sure we can (and may still have to, LOL) go to a bank and pay a ton of interest to a bunch of faceless suits (no offense to any bankers who may be reading this) and open like every other business does.....  or we can try something different.</p>
<p align=""left""><strong>We would rather give away some serious discounts, for a limited time, and ""Pay it Forward"" to Our Clients, Rather than a Bank.</strong>  <br/>The people we wouldn't already have had a business for the past four years without..... and will now hopefully earn some new Clients along the way.</p>

<p>This space has been sitting vacant for a very long time and requires a complete gut and renovation.  Which means it will be absolutely pristine when we are finished but getting to that point is going to cost some serious cash and a little bit of time and labor.  Also- Licensing, Permitting, Materials, Advertising, Employees, Taxes, Merchandise, Furniture, Body Art Equipment &amp; Supplies, Insurance, Gallery Set Up.... It all adds up very quickly.  <br/>     We decided to let everyone get involved and thank them generously in return.  We've come up with some great Perks and hope you wont miss your chance to take advantage of them while they last, because once this campaign is over there will never be pricing like this again at either shop.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help.  If you are tight on cash but still want to help us succeed then loosen up those lips and start talking, to everyone!  And even better, if you are on Facebook, Twitter, or whatever, you can post this campaign to your page to share with everyone you know.  IndieGoGo has made it so simple.  <strong>Just look for the share tools on this page.</strong></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><p> </p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","$100,000 seems like a lot but either way you get your Perk.  Boston will open with or without the success of this campaign, even still we already have a functioning shop!
Thank you for coming to our campaign page. 
If this is your first time here, or would like to learn more about what we are trying to accomplish and why, please scroll down and read on.  
If you are already familiar with our campaign and have already decided to contribute, please direct your attention to the column on your right.  
___________________________________________________________________
 
Our Existing Business is Great - but we want more and this is what we are going to do about it....
Boston Body Art Studio & Gallery
A Hybrid Body Art Modification Studio & Commission-Free Art Gallery for the City's Art Students' in the Center of Boston.  
The Body Art Studio will employ only the best in their craft offering tattoos, body piercing and eventually permanent makeup.  The Gallery will gather it's artwork from local art students & artists looking to get into, or advancing in, the Art Community.  The space is so large, we couldn't not put one in and will still have room for retail.  Unlike other galleries though we will already have a fully functioning business to cover the overhead, so 100% of the money from art sales will go directly into the (student) Artist's pocket.  We feel it will be the perfect hybrid, continually drawing inspiration from one another.    
     But our Campaign's success is dependent on the community, who will decide if this is something they want for their community.  No matter if this Campaign is successful or not the shop will still open, but we are hoping this works (hint, hint.....)
 ___________________________________________________________________

 You're Probably Asking Yourself-
""Why The Hell Would They Give Away Free Time on Tattoos?""
Well that's simple.  Sure we can (and may still have to, LOL) go to a bank and pay a ton of interest to a bunch of faceless suits (no offense to any bankers who may be reading this) and open like every other business does.....  or we can try something different.
We would rather give away some serious discounts, for a limited time, and ""Pay it Forward"" to Our Clients, Rather than a Bank.  The people we wouldn't already have had a business for the past four years without..... and will now hopefully earn some new Clients along the way.
  ___________________________________________________________________


Why We Need Funds-
This space has been sitting vacant for a very long time and requires a complete gut and renovation.  Which means it will be absolutely pristine when we are finished but getting to that point is going to cost some serious cash and a little bit of time and labor.  Also- Licensing, Permitting, Materials, Advertising, Employees, Taxes, Merchandise, Furniture, Body Art Equipment & Supplies, Insurance, Gallery Set Up.... It all adds up very quickly.       We decided to let everyone get involved and thank them generously in return.  We've come up with some great Perks and hope you wont miss your chance to take advantage of them while they last, because once this campaign is over there will never be pricing like this again at either shop.

 
Get Perks!  Perks!  Perks!  Perks!  Perks!  Perks!  Perks!  Perks!
If you are generous enough to contribute pick from any of these Perks below.  Prices are suggestions but you can contribute any amount you want for any Perk as long as you meet the minimum requirement.  
___________________________________________________________________
  
$1+ for an eShout Out 
Every little bit counts.  If you would like to help us reach our goal please keep in mind every dollar counts.  If enough people get together and each do a small thing, combined it becomes a great big thing.  We realize that & will appreciate every contribution towards making our dream a reality.  If you choose this perk you can contribute any amount from $1 to $10,000 or more (lol, we wish).  Even if it’s only a few dollars, we still want to express our gratitude, and will do so by giving you a shout out on our website.  Every Funder will be listed here unless they want to remain anonymous.
___________________________________________________________________

$10 for a Decal
Want a wicked badass sticker of your very own?  Slap it on your laptop, fridge, bumper, the annoying roommate asleep in the next room, wherever.  The only way to get one of these badass decal stickers is to become a Funder on this Campaign so don't miss your chance.  We will ship it anywhere in the Continental US.And get your name on our website's Thank You List.
___________________________________________________________________                        
 
$20+ for the Great Wall of Funder
Help out our cause and you will be forever in our hearts, on our website, and on our walls too.  Each Funder of $20 or more will get their name etched onto a little metal Funder Plate that we will mount permanently onto a wall in the studio for all to see.  Once we are open for business, stop by for a picture with your plate, then post it online so everyone knows what a wonderful and generous person you are, as if they don't know already.  And get your name on our website's Thank You List.

<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Who are we?</b><br/></p>
<p>We are four Industrial Design Engineering
students of The Hague University of Applied Science, passionately working on a project focussed on
developing a shoe concept that takes the advantage of 3D printing and 3D scanning technologies. The
aim of our project is to use and test these technologies and to find the best
possible bridge between orthopedic shoes and fashionable, but uncomfortable
shoes. A combination of a 3D printed ""inner-shoe"" and a traditionally
manufactured ""outer-shoe"" is the result of 5 months of hard work, but now it is time to take it to the next level,  the production. With the right funds, we can complete the prototyping and
testing process and fully develop the best ways to implement these technologies
in the shoe market. The step towards full utilization of 3D printing
technologies for the shoe industry can only be realized with the right
prototypes and this requires funding. That is why we ask you to support us in
reaching our goal of producing final prototypes of both the inner and the outer
shoe. </p>
<p><b>Konzept:</b></p>
<p>Despite
the natural biomechanics of the feet, ready-to-wear shoes nowadays are
still standardized, contributing to potential feet disease and injuries. Konzept is designed for young people, who need to prevent such cases. This piece introduce a long-term solution that aims to offer the
market one of the most individual pair of shoes, fully customizable,
combining 3D printing technology with traditional manufacturing processes.
Using 3D scanning technology to complete a scan of each individual foot, allows
a 3D printer to build a flexible but sturdy ""sock-like"" inner shoe, delivering
a unique fit for the user. This inner shoe is made of flexible material and is
very durable, but most importantly can be used in several outer shoes to fit
different contexts. This way, comfort can be taken anywhere you want.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457688879/ydpqmfjjr6ajw2o80znd.jpg"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">As shown, the shoe exists out of two parts. The inner part is a 3D-printed sock-like wearable, printed to fit the exact shape of your feet. 3D scanning technology is used to create a model of the negative of one's individual feet. Experts convert this negative to create a model around it and add further corrections, which will help the user to gain a high level of comfort. Together with the expertise of official Orthopedic shoe-makers, we will adjust the support of the shoe according to personal needs. Using flexible filament (Ninjaflex/Filaflex) on an FDM printer, the inner shoe is then printed. </span></p>
<div>The outer part of the shoe is traditionally manufactured and can be customized to personal preferences. For the start up of this project, we will focus on one basic model, a shoe that would fit casual occasions such as several types of work environments, study surroundings and recreational ones. The range of models will be further expanded in the future, as we proceed working on the development of Konzept. </div>
<div>Why two parts? During our research, we realized that current 3D printed shoes are often too extreme and artistic for the users. By using two parts, it is not only possible to transport comfort into several shoes, it also allows the user to keep within acceptable looks for a 3D printed product. It is basically bridging the gap between extreme artistic shoes and the normal shoes we know. Also, by having two parts, we can continue developing different models for the outer shoe, possibly exploring more specific fields. </div>
<div>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457694012/bjk14fntfykuxgoojy0e.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">The thought behind the Konzept shoe is based on the unmet need for having ultimate and long-lasting comfort while being able to walk around in style. The current shoe market aims at mass production, surpassing the need for personal attention. Basic shoe models cause problems for those who have slightly different feet, such as blisters, injury and possible back problems. The thought of getting a pair of custom orthopedic shoes is still often associated with unpleasantly looking, often large shoes, and if there are no significant problems yet, then why bother? </span><br/>
</div>
<div>3D printing and scanning technologies are opening up new possibilities for a future of widely implementing customized products. The possibilities are there, but we are not that accessible yet to the average user. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Konzept uses the opportunities to adres not only prevention of  health related problems, it also allows the user to optimally benefit from the value it delivers. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Our solution is personal and innovative, so perfect for those who face problems with standard sizes of shoes and happen to have an interest for design and technology! </span>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">In order to development a proper production plan, we need to test the functioning of the inner and outer shoe, and their behavior together. We will make real-sized prototypes, in order to test comfort, fit and behavior in different climates.  The university don't own the correctly sized printers we need, so we have to involve an outside company to support us with printing the shoe models. This is more expensive but necessary for proper results that we can use to conduct tests. Costs per shoe: 150€. </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The outer shoe will be produced in collaboration with an orthopedic shoe company in The Hague, but the expenses are for us. We plan to make 2 pairs of shoes to test size, behavior and different materials in combination with the inner shoe. Total costs: 300€.</span></p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal of 1000€, we will still use the money for our prototypes but we will be limited in the amount of prototypes and testing we can do. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Final implementation of this project needs a lot of development because of the costs involved. We might have to invest in our own printer in order to start production at a bigger scale. </p>
<p>Entering in a new market is always risky, as there are likely obstacles that we are not fully aware of. However, our research led us to believe that we can take this risk, and we are confident that we can pass these obstacles. </p>

developing a shoe concept that takes the advantage of 3D printing and 3D scanning technologies. The
aim of our project is to use and test these technologies and to find the best
possible bridge between orthopedic shoes and fashionable, but uncomfortable
shoes. A combination of a 3D printed ""inner-shoe"" and a traditionally
manufactured ""outer-shoe"" is the result of 5 months of hard work, but now it is time to take it to the next level,  the production. With the right funds, we can complete the prototyping and
testing process and fully develop the best ways to implement these technologies
in the shoe market. The step towards full utilization of 3D printing
technologies for the shoe industry can only be realized with the right
prototypes and this requires funding. That is why we ask you to support us in
reaching our goal of producing final prototypes of both the inner and the outer
shoe. 
Konzept:
Despite
the natural biomechanics of the feet, ready-to-wear shoes nowadays are
still standardized, contributing to potential feet disease and injuries. Konzept is designed for young people, who need to prevent such cases. This piece introduce a long-term solution that aims to offer the
market one of the most individual pair of shoes, fully customizable,
combining 3D printing technology with traditional manufacturing processes.
Using 3D scanning technology to complete a scan of each individual foot, allows
a 3D printer to build a flexible but sturdy ""sock-like"" inner shoe, delivering
a unique fit for the user. This inner shoe is made of flexible material and is
very durable, but most importantly can be used in several outer shoes to fit
different contexts. This way, comfort can be taken anywhere you want.As shown, the shoe exists out of two parts. The inner part is a 3D-printed sock-like wearable, printed to fit the exact shape of your feet. 3D scanning technology is used to create a model of the negative of one's individual feet. Experts convert this negative to create a model around it and add further corrections, which will help the user to gain a high level of comfort. Together with the expertise of official Orthopedic shoe-makers, we will adjust the support of the shoe according to personal needs. Using flexible filament (Ninjaflex/Filaflex) on an FDM printer, the inner shoe is then printed. 
The outer part of the shoe is traditionally manufactured and can be customized to personal preferences. For the start up of this project, we will focus on one basic model, a shoe that would fit casual occasions such as several types of work environments, study surroundings and recreational ones. The range of models will be further expanded in the future, as we proceed working on the development of Konzept. 
Why two parts? During our research, we realized that current 3D printed shoes are often too extreme and artistic for the users. By using two parts, it is not only possible to transport comfort into several shoes, it also allows the user to keep within acceptable looks for a 3D printed product. It is basically bridging the gap between extreme artistic shoes and the normal shoes we know. Also, by having two parts, we can continue developing different models for the outer shoe, possibly exploring more specific fields. 





The thought behind the Konzept shoe is based on the unmet need for having ultimate and long-lasting comfort while being able to walk around in style. The current shoe market aims at mass production, surpassing the need for personal attention. Basic shoe models cause problems for those who have slightly different feet, such as blisters, injury and possible back problems. The thought of getting a pair of custom orthopedic shoes is still often associated with unpleasantly looking, often large shoes, and if there are no significant problems yet, then why bother? 

3D printing and scanning technologies are opening up new possibilities for a future of widely implementing customized products. The possibilities are there, but we are not that accessible yet to the average user. Konzept uses the opportunities to adres not only prevention of  health related problems, it also allows the user to optimally benefit from the value it delivers. Our solution is personal and innovative, so perfect for those who face problems with standard sizes of shoes and happen to have an interest for design and technology! 


What We Need & What You Get
In order to development a proper production plan, we need to test the functioning of the inner and outer shoe, and their behavior together. We will make real-sized prototypes, in order to test comfort, fit and behavior in different climates.  The university don't own the correctly sized printers we need, so we have to involve an outside company to support us with printing the shoe models. This is more expensive but necessary for proper results that we can use to conduct tests. Costs per shoe: 150€. 
The outer shoe will be produced in collaboration with an orthopedic shoe company in The Hague, but the expenses are for us. We plan to make 2 pairs of shoes to test size, behavior and different materials in combination with the inner shoe. Total costs: 300€.
If we don't reach our goal of 1000€, we will still use the money for our prototypes but we will be limited in the amount of prototypes and testing we can do. 

By funding our project, you will become a part of the actualization of this step into the future! 


    
Risks & Challenges Final implementation of this project needs a lot of development because of the costs involved. We might have to invest in our own printer in order to start production at a bigger scale. 
Entering in a new market is always risky, as there are likely obstacles that we are not fully aware of. However, our research led us to believe that we can take this risk, and we are confident that we can pass these obstacles.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign
