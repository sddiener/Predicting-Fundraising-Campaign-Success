<p>The ""Whole Access"" project will make Central MN Farmer's Markets, Food Coops, and CSA Farms accessible to low-income families who have SNAP benefits (formerly known as Food Stamps). This ambitious new project is being led by the Central Minnesota Sustainability Project, a regionally-based community organization that connects people with land and with each other.</p>
<p>At the Central Minnesota Sustainability Project (CMSP), we seek to make sustainable living in harmony with the planet a practice we can all share. We do this by intentionally building cross-racial, cross-cultural alliances, with healthy fresh food access as the common denominator. Our transformational community work has resulted in multicultural community garden spaces, innovative food entrepreneurship programs, and Story Circle events where diverse families from immigrant, refugee, and other marginalized backgrounds come together to discuss land dis/reconnection, food sovereignty, and finding a sense of place.</p>
<p>The ""Whole Access"" Project is focused on making sure that all members of our community can access and purchase healthy fresh food, by walking area markets through the complicated process of becoming FNS-certified and accepting EBT as a form of payment. In a parallel process, we are also developing an open-source, community training about accessing affordable healthy foods while maintaining our cultural and religious food traditions.</p>

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>One in 10 families in Central Minnesota are food insecure. These are working families, men, women, &amp; children who are struggling to make ends meet, who have to decide between paying the water bill and buying enough food for the week. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The families we work with face significant economic and
accessibility barriers to consuming healthy fresh food: affordability, lack of available transportation to and from
markets, lack of time to shop and time to prepare meals, and lack of education
about how to cook healthfully using local foods. These barriers have a
huge impact on the low-income families from immigrant backgrounds who are
dealing with the additional obstacle of having unique cultural food needs that
are not met by many fresh food markets. </p>
<p>On the other side of this dynamic
is the farmer who is running a small farm operation, sustainable and organic.
These businesses struggle to be profitable, and while the most recent Farm Bill
has made some strides in supporting small farms, the decks remain stacked
against these farmers who have not traditionally had access to subsidies, federal loans and the many other ways our government has supported industrial
agriculture. We see an opportunity to bring two areas of need together. EBT
(Electronic Benefit Transfer) is the payment option for families participating
in SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), previously known as the
Food Stamp Program. One in seven Americans participates in SNAP annually. Every
year, roughly $75 billion in SNAP funds are allocated to families. What better
way to use these supplemental funds than to provide access for low-income
families to use their food assistance benefits to purchase healthy, fresh food
from their local farmers?   </p>
<p>If we are successful, we will see a 50% increase in Central Minnesota fresh food markets accepting EBT payments. This evolution in our markets not only makes fresh food more accessible for low-income families - it also creates a new income stream for small sustainable farmers who struggle to run profitable businesses. Through this work, we make our local food movement more diverse and accessible - we change who gets a seat at the Local Foods Table. </p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>This work will not be easy. The primary challenge we face in helping markets become EBT-accessible is that it takes a lot of time and effort, and most farmer's markets do not have dedicated staff. We believe that with the incredible skills of our Americorps VISTA, we can make the process easier for market managers. But we know that in the end, market managers and their boards have to be 100% committed to accessibility and diversity in their customer base in order to sustain this work over the long-term.</p>
<p>We are uniquely qualified to lead this work. Our track record of building successful and sustainable partnerships in the community has resulted in hundreds of low-income families growing healthy, fresh food for themselves with significant economic value. Our education program has raised the consciousness of our whole community about the importance of this work, and the possibility of its impact on our region's economic and social prosperity. </p>
<p>Change happens through relationships, and we will make change one market and farm at a time, allowing the domino effect of business owners seeing the success of this model in their community, and in their business bank accounts, to lead the way forward.</p>

It is the same old story year after year and seems to be getting worse. I began to wonder what it would take to make a considerable difference and began seriously thinking about this issue. I talked to several people at that time and their response was ""it happens every spring and it gets better in early summer, not much you can do."" While I do understand the reasoning behind these statements, I also couldn't help but wonder, if it never gets cleaned up, the problem has to be compounding with each passing year. The solution to a significant reduction is a continuous, year round effort to remove what is there. This is exactly the point that people began to think I had lost my mind. ""You do know how big the Lake is, right?"" was the most common comment, followed by ""and there are tons upon tons of logs and sticks that hold all the plastic bottles and trash, you can't do anything with that."" So maybe I was crazy, I kept thinking about it.</p><p>I'm gonna try to make a long story as short as possible. I found some commercially produced equipment that works very well on floating debris. I have posted some video of these boats in action and they are very impressive. They are also very expensive, with a sticker price of about $500,000 bucks. While these boats are awesome, I could also see how they would be limited as to what they could do and I began to think about how to build something better. I had a pretty good idea of the design and a rough estimate of what it would cost to have it built, so I went deeper into the numbers. It quickly became clear that this was going to cost alot of money, and while I was pretty confident that we could figure out a way to raise the money needed, the idea faded into everything else that was going on at the time and the issue found its way to the bottom of my to do list.</p><p>Like clockwork, spring came and again, the debris was awful, but it was a little different this year. Many long time boaters, some several decades, were talking about never seeing anything even close to the amount of garbage in the lake, so here I go again. Picking up where I left off, the cost had to be nailed down and the funding had to be seriously looked at to see if this was a possibility. So this is where we are and if the numbers look concerning, you have to continue reading to see how it makes sense. I will briefly go into more detail about the equipment and operations in a moment, but first, let's look at some numbers. The first year operating cost is estimated at about 1.2 million dollars which includes building the boat, buying the accessory equipment, four full time employees, and the operating cost. The obvious question at this point is how could we possibly think seriously about this with the cost being so high? The answer is in the numbers.</p><p>Setting an annual membership fee at $50, it would take 20,000 members to raise a million dollars. While researching the number of visitors to Lake Cumberland, I consistently found the estimated number at 4.7 million people per year. I have no clue how these numbers were generated, but assuming they are close to accurate, the idea of getting a mere 20,000 no longer seemed impossible. Feeling a little more comfortable about the question of funding, I moved on to what turned out to be the most difficult problem to solve which was what to do with the seemingly endless amount of floating debris and given the size of the lake, could it be done? I have to admit, on more than one occasion, I felt there was no good answer but I finally put it all together and I will briefly explain the plan.</p><p>First, we would locate several locations that would be suitable as holding areas. These holding areas would be small coves where we could temporarily contain the debris using containment bouys secured as far back into the cove as possible. The “boat” is really a floating conveyor belt with a 12’x40’x3’ hold which will carry a large amount of debris. The conveyor will quickly remove everything floating on the surface and load it into the hold, it will be transported to the nearby containment area, and a conveyor will quickly offload the boat into this area. Basically, we are picking it up and moving it to an area that it will be contained. Once the distance from the debris field that we are working on becomes too great, we set up another containment area and continue the process. As the lake levels begin to fall, the debris in these containment areas will be on dry land. At that point, we return to these areas and separate the trash for proper disposal, and remove the natural debris in a number of ways including chipping, hauling and burning. This is a full time year around operation and all of the debris that will be removed will be that much less to contend with when the higher water levels return the following spring. This would be clean up on a massive scale and unlike anything that has previously been done in an attempt to address this problem. The boat will be capable of picking up everything from Styrofoam cups to large logs and will swallow huge debris fields very quickly.</p><p>So, with the two seemingly impossible questions having viable answers, the ultimate question is will we get the support to make this happen. While nearly everyone that I talk to concerning this idea thinks that it is much needed and are very encouraging, will people, in large numbers, actually get out their debit card and support getting this started. That is what we are doing now with a fund raising campaign that will set this plan in motion. With enough support, we can begin the process of setting up the infrastructure needed to complete this project. First we have to legally become a non-profit organization, then set up bank accounts, get a website up and running and begin getting quotes on the various equipment needed. I am also convinced that we can get the cooperation of businesses, local governments and other organizations with similar interest and the potential for grants or other government funding needs to be explored. This is a big idea with a lot of work yet to do, however, working together, I think this could easily become a reality and Lake Cumberland will be a cleaner and safer place to spend our leisure time.</p><p>Thanks you for taking the time to look at this idea, thanks for your support, and please share with family and friends that love the lake.</p><p>By donating here to get this idea headed toward a reality, you will not only get your first year of membership, but with your $50 dollar pledge you will be known as a Founding Member of the Association and receive two window stickers that signify you as a founding member.  If you love the idea of being a member, your $100 pledge will also include a commemorative coin that you can display in your boat, home or office that signifies you as a founding member.  </p><p>I am more than excited about seeing this become a large group of Lake Cumberland boaters working together to not only make our lake more enjoyable, but also working on other worthwhile projects as a group.

Food
Security is one of the most pressing issues of our time and must be tackled to
stem global hunger.  Food Security is a
little understood topic and rarely felt issue in the developed world, including
the United States.  Nevertheless, the
lack of Food Security is a pestilent and global health problem causing
undernourishment and malnutrition in the most impoverished regions of the
world.  
 
According
to the United Nations FAO (2010), Asia and the Pacific region is currently the
most food insecure region in the world where approximately 578 million people
(nearly two times the population of the U.S.) experience malnutrition and lack
the recommended daily caloric intake.  
One of the most food insecure countries in this region is Cambodia.  The country is still recovering since 1979
from the effects of a brutal genocide by the Khmer Rouge, where an attempt at
agrarian/agricultural reform led to widespread famine and death.  Today, approximately 22% of the population remains
undernourished and approximately 31% remain under the poverty line.  In addition, nearly 1 in 2 Cambodian children
under the age of five are malnourished (Cambodia Food Security and Nutrition
government website, 2011).  Food security and nutrition are at the forefront
of discussions worldwide via the United Nations as well as Cambodian
policy-makers. As part of a national strategy to combat hunger in impoverished
rural areas, food security has been identified as a paramount issue to progress
the country.
 
Our Story
My
 name
is Brian Reyes and I am a recently departed environmental services 
professional, whom is looking to utilize my education, skills and 
talents
to make a more magnanimous impact on the world.  I have recently been
offered a fellowship with a San Francisco non-profit NGO which has 
conducted
unique, positive and sustainable international community development 
work for the
past 16 years in Cambodia, Tanzania and Thailand.
 
My
vital work, on behalf of Global Service Corps (GSC), a San Francisco based
501(c)(3) non-profit NGO, will take me to the impoverished rural areas (Takeo
Province) of Cambodia.  To battle the
adverse impacts of malnutrition, a Sustainable Agriculture and Food Security
Community Development Pilot Project will be established via building a community
educational garden and compost center.
 

The
goal of this project is to stabilize food supply in one of the most
impoverished rural areas in Cambodia through community development, partnership
formation, education and training.  GSC
and I will build this educational and training center at an existing Orphanage
Facility in Takeo province, which houses 60 children and 25 adults – many of
whom are HIV/AIDS infected.  Not only
will these children and adults, but, also community leaders, nearby schools,
local teachers/educators, and families can gather here to learn about
subsistence farming, crop diversification, feasible post-harvest (food
preservation, food drying), and sustainable agriculture techniques such as
bio-intensive agriculture (BIA) methods.  The training does not require
any complicated machinery.  All methods and techniques are easily
replicated and focuses on small-scale or mini-farming for subsistence; NOT
large scale farming.  This is Sustainable Agriculture training and
education at the Community Grass Roots Level, which empowers individuals
and families to achieve their own food security. 
GSC and
I will educate and inspire current and future community leaders to educate
their own community, which will ideally perpetuate the basic understanding and
necessity of Sustainable Agriculture and post-harvest techniques to achieve
Food Security.  
 
The
following objectives and benchmarks are to be accomplished to meet this goal: 


Prior to project start date,
     develop existing partners and identify potential partners (accomplished)

Perform a needs assessment of
     the region
Establish a sustainable
     community garden (currently under construction) at the well-known and
     existing GSC orphanage facility in Takeo Province
Utilize the garden to
     educate, feed and meet the caloric demands of over 60 children and 25
     adults currently living in the orphanage – many of whom are HIV/AIDS
     infected
Develop and coordinate with
     existing and potential partners currently working in nearby
     villages/communities
Engage adjacent
     villages/communities and build relationships with community leaders/farmers
Utilize the garden to
     conduct educational and training modules for orphanage families and
     children and community leaders/local farmers, which will be held
     year-round 
Increase attendance and
     extend the coverage of the educational and training center throughout the
     region
Send service-learning
     volunteers monthly to aid staff in the training and education of orphaned
     children, families and community leaders/local farmers
 
This
project is not without precedence.  GSC
has successfully scaled up a Sustainable Agriculture and Food Security Program
in Tanzania, which has now received over 1,000 service-learning volunteers
since inception and employs 37 in-country staff.  GSC and I will draw from its 16 years experience
in East Africa and transfer its successful community development model, Best
Management Practices and techniques in Sustainable Agriculture and Food
Security to Cambodia.
 
Sustainable
Agriculture & Food Security Techniques
The
following are brief descriptions of successful techniques GSC has been
utilizing for the past 16 years in East Africa and could be deployed in
Cambodia.
Bio-intensive agriculture (BIA) 
Bio-intensive
agriculture (BIA) is a method of small-scale organic farming that involves
using double-dug beds, composting, intensive planting, and companion planting.  GSC has been using this method for over 10
years in Tanzania.   Made popular by John
Jeavons of the GROW BIOINTENSIVE Mini-Farming Program for Ecology Action, BIA
focuses on building reusable and healthy soil and increasing the efficiency of
the land used to increase crop yields for subsistence and community farmers
(for more information about BIA and GROW BIOINTENSIVE Mini-Farming, visit www.growbiointensive.org).Post-Harvest Techniques: Food
Drying and Improved Grain Storage
Typical
on-farm losses from field to table exceed 50% due to the lack of food
preservation knowledge and methods.  GSC
trainings include alternative low-cost drying structures, education about
appropriate drying methods, and information sessions on how to reconstitute the
dried foods for preparation and use in cooking.
 
 GSCs
grain storage training helps rural communities alter their traditional grain
stores and reduce their current average food losses, which exceeds 40% from
field to table. Training the local community on improved grain storage
techniques and tools allows them to reduce field-to-table losses.
  
 
Rainwater Catchments
In
Tanzania, they are called Hafirs.  In
many areas of Tanzania, water shortage is a serious problem.  It is impossible to grow home gardens and
keep livestock alive without water. Building a hafir, a 12 cubic meters water
storage trench lined with plastic or clay, can collect enough rain water to maintain
a garden or sustain livestock through the dry season.  This may be a useful feasible technology in
Cambodia, which experiences monsoonal downpours during the rainy season (June –
October), but experiences a largely rainless and dry season during the winter
(November – June).Other Methods/Techniques
Other
methods and techniques may have to be developed on the ground based on a needs
assessment and distinct geographic, climatic, soil, dietary and cultural
make-up of the community and region.  
 
For example,
Newcastle Disease kills 70% of the chicken population in Tanzania, which has an
especially significant impact on poor households that rely on chickens for food
and income generation.   GSC has provided
and disseminated vaccination of poultry against this life threatening
disease.  Chickens have lived longer,
thereby, being able to produce more eggs and grow larger for eating. 
Another
example is a Sack Garden.  In Tanzania,
GSC has trained families with limited space and resources on how to build sack
gardens, which provides them with a sustainable means of growing local vegetables
and improving their diets.  Sack gardens
are popular in urban and limited space gardens. 
They are typically made by enclosing a growth medium (soil/compost)
mixed with seeds in a burlap and woven plastic bag.
 
The
Impact of This Community Development Pilot Project
First
and foremost, I will lead in planning and building the community garden, which
will meet the daily caloric needs of the HIV/AIDS impacted children and adults
currently housed at the Orphanage facility in Takeo Province.    Then, I will build relationships with
nearby community leaders and/or members; encouraging them to visit the newly
built Community Educational Garden and Compost Center at the Orphanage.  Since the Orphanage is a well known way point
in the region, GSC and I will utilize the newly built garden to train and
educate community leaders and educators in the sustainable agricultural methods
and food security techniques discussed above. 
The newly acquired knowledge by community leaders and educators will then be
shared with other community stakeholders.  GSCs model has been
successfully deployed in Tanzania.  It is
expected to yield similar results in attaining long-term Food Security for
rural populations as well as building local capacity.If I do not raise the money, I
will not go.  We expect malnutrition and food insecurity to
continue to be a pestilent problem for this underserved rural population of
Cambodia if GSC and I do not successfully launch and establish this crucial
project.  Nevertheless, we fully expect
to succeed because of GSCs track record in Tanzania and my educational (B.S.
Soil Science, M.S. Environmental Management) and professional skills (Associate
Professional Soil Scientist, Environmental Planner, Sustainable
Agriculture).  
 
What We Need & What You Get

I will need to fundraise upwards
of $6,800 to cover my room and board, food, a visa, travelers insurance, air
fare, vaccinations and regional transportation expenses over a 6-month
span.  Materials such as basic farming
expenses (spade, pitch fork, shovels, seeds, etc.) will be provided by GSC.  In addition, resources such as GSCs
in-country program assistant, office in Phnom Penh, administrative supplies,
and the Orphanage Facility’s land, water, and other labor to build this
agricultural plot will be provided by GSC.
 
100% of the money donated will go
towards my basic needs and transportation costs regionally and possibly
cross-country to develop partnerships with community stakeholders and
like-minded partner organizations.  It
sounds a bit fishy right?  But, I
guarantee you that my time there, the use of my talents and skills, and GSCs model
and track record will translate into getting the Community Development Project
properly built so that it will feed the adjacent community and educate the
region in utilizing simple and effective Sustainable Agriculture and Food

· We believe that the purpose of the original Open Space zoning was to protect Holly Creek.  Shoe-horning houses or apartments between Patapsco Rd and B & A was never the intention of the original zoning plan.  There was no “mistake” by the zoning planners.

Archaeology for 27 years, and I specialise in ancient agriculture. I am halfway
through writing my book, entitled, ‘How Archaeology can Save the Planet:
Sustainability out of the past’; I have a publisher, but my
workload is such that I have no time to finish it. I am looking to raise $15,000, which would enable me to take time out to

to create a television series based on the book, with the help of a filmmaker

<p>The plan for my book is as
follows: </p>
<p>There have been many books
written about what we can learn from the failures of the past, but I want to
take a more optimistic view, focussing on what we have to learn from past
successes. This book will be about sustainable agriculture in the past, and the
engineering works that supported it, but it also looks to the future. Ancient
technologies are what engineers define as ‘intermediate’, which means that they
are simple, low in cost and they depend on local materials. Significantly, they
don’t require fossil fuels. There is now broad agreement among many
governments, non-government organisations, engineers and agronomists, as well
as the United Nations, that intermediate technologies are often the most
appropriate way forward in developing countries. The New Green Revolution is
looking to traditional knowledge, rather than to technology, to solve problems
of decreasing yields and environmental impoverishment.</p>
<p>This subject is controversial and
I have been accused of suggesting ‘pie in the sky’ ideas, but the
re-introductions I’m suggesting are already being carried out in countries all
over the world. Water harvesting and other dryland systems are being re-introduced
in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan,
Libya, Morocco, Pakistan,
Syria, Tunisia, Yemen, Afghanistan
and Oman.
Other early technologies are being put back to work in Peru, Bolivia,
India, Bangladesh, Niger,
Burkina Faso
and many more. I would like to raise awareness of the fact that we already have
the technology to make sweeping changes to the way that we grow food and manage
the environment; we could be producing more food per hectare, and we could be
doing it more sustainably. </p>
<p>As the climate changes, it is
imperative that we come up with new ways of managing our environment. Deserts
are spreading, wetlands will increase as the sea level rises, and we need to
find ways to cope with an increasing population. There is a lot that we in the
West can learn from the past and from developing countries where people still
practice traditional agriculture. I am not advocating a wholesale return to
past technologies, nor am I suggesting the adoption of early technology in
place of modern engineering and agriculture. What I am suggesting is that we
combine some aspects of early technology with new systems and inventions, to
create a healthier, more sustainable and environmentally richer planet. </p>

<h2>Pick A Piece Of Rubbish</h2>
<h3>Although I do not like eating Plastic Soup, I love to pick the little pieces of plastic, iron, glass, polystyrine etc. <em>out of nature</em>, before they are eaten by animals, or just buried in the stoney beaches.</h3>
<p><strong>And: I like to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vatphNTkb7k"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Categorizing at Ruskenpatruljen Headquarter "">categorize</a> what I find and make <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1LL9FgCO6o"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Building the exhibition Message in a Bottle"">art</a> out of it!</strong></p>
<div>Plastic Soup, or a garbage patch, is a catchy word for the incredible amount of marine debris in our planets oceans. The longer plastic is in the water, the smaller it becomes. And in the end it's called microplastic: mostly it is said that the pieces are smaller than 5mm.</div>
<div>Many animals (birds, fish) often mistake these pieces for plankton.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I could write pages of information about details, but this place is not meant for that. More information you can find on our facebook page PickAPieceOfRubbish.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Plastic Soup is a global problem but local challenge: in the Pacific, but also in the fjord of Oslo, Norway. Big garbage, like bottles or fishing nets are easy to remove. But for little pieces, just before they become microplast, you need to get down on your knees. And that is exactly what I like!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div>I enjoy working in almost all weather conditions. I enjoy working hard and I enjoy making art out of the debris that I find.</div>
<div> </div>
<p><strong>I will work on 2 beaches in Oslo's fjord:</strong></p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Bygdøyness is a tiny beach (behind Kontiki Museum) where many tourists take a break from visiting museums. Here I as often as possible talk with and inform people from all corners of the world. Because of the incoming tides there is always a lot of small marine debris.</li>
<li>Nakkholmen, several beaches on the island. Here are not many tourists, but lot's of birds and a lot (!) of garbage.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>So I want to be <em>on my knees</em> this coming summer, but I also want to support my family. So I am asking for your help: <em>not on my knees</em>, but as someone who loves nature and strongly believes that trash is not nature's responsibility but ours!</div>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>My ultimate dream</strong> is that I work all year through on different beaches in the world, picking up marine debris and raising awareness prefarably with a hundred people joining me on their knees.</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>My Goal at Indiegogo</h2>
<div> </div>
<div>To have this ultimate dream is important for me, but here at Indiegogo I am aiming for<strong> <em>a month on the beach</em></strong> to clean. So I took the average month salary of a cleaner in Norway: </div>
<div>
<br/><em><strong>Cleaners in Norway</strong></em> -  Their salary varies depending on whether they are working privately or in the community, but in the municipality about 130 NOK per hour, ie 25,350 (€ <strong>3,363.84</strong>) per month.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I decided that <strong>€ 3,333 (</strong>25,126.62 NOK) was a better sound bite.</div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div>This includes tax (they love that here in Norway) and expenses like travelling, gloves, cleaning tools etc., marketing, administration, fees at Indiegogo and making the art works.</div>
<div>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Ways To Support</strong></h2>
<p>First of all I think it is necessary to realize our global challenge with marine debris. Plastic that is not disposed in a correct way will often find a way to water. Through the sewage system and storm drains, creeks and rivers, it finds its way to our seas and oceans.</p>
<p>Birds, fishes, shrimps and even polar bears have often our rubbish in their bodies.</p>
<p>So the <em>first</em> way of support is to take care of your trash and pick up a piece of rubbish every now and then.</p>
<p>A <em>second</em> way is to take some hours to clean a beach or a river side. Or even a storm drain.</p>
<p><em>And you can support me!</em></p>
<p>On the right side of this page you see the perks.</p>
<p>Basically there are 2 categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>I send you an image or a movie (digitally) or a physical artwork (by mail) as a thank you</li>
<li>You make an amount of time on the beach possible, without a physical artwork. Gratitude is your reward!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Finally, I would really, really appreciate it if you spread the word through facebook, twitter and to all of your email contacts.</p>
<p>I can work more than one month!</p>
<p><br/>Thank you kindly...</p>

</div></div>","Our Story
Julie and I first heard about this rally at a community event. It instantly sparked something in us, our sense of adventure and the challenge of no GPS. As we found out more, we discovered it lined up with our passions with The Heart of the Gazelles. We desire to make a difference, and want to inspire others to do the same. That is the driving force behind us. We are ordinary women with extraordinary dreams.  Together we are determined to make this happen and to be an example to every woman that anything is truly possible if you put your mind to it.

The Impact
This is the only rally where women from all over the world can come to compete through the Moroccan desert. They only navigate via map and compass for 9 days. Thereâ€™s also a medical caravan that goes along Morocco to provide medical, education, and housing for those less fortunate. During this years rally, they will be building a school.  This rally is truly an amazing opportunity to help the benefactor of this event, The Heart of Gazelles.  Your donation does not just go to help us race, it is improving life for those in Morocco. Heart of Gazelles works in collaboration with the Moroccan Government on projects whose importance has been evaluated and analysed. 

Heart of Gazelles projects for the last 3 years:Medical: The Medical Caravan, sponsored by TOTAL- 20,000 consultations (General Medicine, Paediatrics, Gynaecology and Optometry),- 3 births,- 31 Trachoma operations,- 3 mammograms submitted for follow-up,- 92 doctors have provided their services, - 1,900 people have received corrective eyeglasses, - 37 handicapped people have been referred to appropriate care facilities, - 4 metric tons of medical equipment have been given to local hospitals (wheelchairs, consultation tables...).
We are only the 4th American team in this years event.  This event needs more recognition in America and helping us get there will further promote this cause.


What We Need & What You Get

In order to make this race happen, we need you!  This is a great opportunity for you or your company to have a chance for some world wide coverage and marketing.  We can showcase your gear, logo, website, and anything, within reason, your company wants to promote.  This mediatisation is international, and includes Radio-Canada, TF1, Eurosport, TV5 Monde, 2M in Morocco, Elle magazine, L'express, the Journal de MontrÃ©al, ChÃ©rie FM... Recounting the passion and the sporting exploits of all these women.  


Keep it mind that all company donations are a taxable marketing expense since we will be showcasing your company or product on our website, vehicle, and gear.

Any personal donation will get personal recognition and a big thank you on our site as well as all social media.
We are also currently in the middle of starting our own non-profit, 501 c3 to further help this cause.  We will have this accomplished within this tax year of 2012.
As of now, we have raised 13K but still need another 15K to make this happen.

</div>","We have reached our minimum goal of $35,000!! THANK YOU.

Our hearts are full of deep appreciation for each and every one of you who made this possible. 

We would now like to raise our goal to $45,000 for the next two days of the campaign! Making this goal would allow us to be able to provide more materials, resources, classes, plant more trees, gardens and implement more projects that would leave a big impact in each city. Any additional donations you can give to this initiative would greatly enhance the experience we can offer at each Action Day and leave a bigger positive trace. 

DEEP GRATITUDE from the Permaculture Action Team

The Polish Ambassador's fall Permaculture Action Tour is bringing together permaculture educators and community organizers to inspire and educate people about how we can make a shift towards a more sustainable and regenerative way of living, and channel this energy into local project builds in each of the cities we visit--getting people to take action to build the world they want to see. 

www.PermacultureAction.org

What We Need 

We need to raise at least $35,000 to support the permaculture educators and community organizers to travel alongside the Polish Ambassador and provide tools, resources and experiential learning opportunities outside the shows. Your donations will keep the permaculture action tour moving across the country and the educators and organizers fed and healthy, print educational materials, provide materials for local projects, and help us document and publish everything we do so everyone can benefit.  

The funds will be distributed to these areas:



Materials for Project Days at urban farms, gardens, and community centers



Food Costs



Van Rental



Fuel Costs



Teaching Materials



Organizer Fees



Educator Fees



Reward Fulfillment



Documenting the Tour, Editing Video, and Creating Media 



General Administrative Costs (Website, Media, etc)


$35,000 will enable us to actually make this tour happen at its most basic level.  Raising beyond $35,000 will allow us to provide more materials to the local sites where we build gardens, permaculture systems, and other community projects in the cities we visit.  Funds raised beyond the goal will also allow us to put more energy towards documenting this process in a way that will inspire other artists to follow suit, and spread this message further through learning materials, publications, and artistic mediums.  Your donations expand the network of transformative work that is already being done. 

Anything raised above $50,000 will go toward the further development of Jumpsuit Farms Impact Center. Over the past 8 years as an electronic music composer, The Polish Ambassador has saved up enough money to purchase a small, but vibrant 10 acre parcel in the foothills of the Sierra Mountains of Northern California. The intention of the project is to establish Jumpsuit Farms, an artist residency and permaculture impact center that supports musicians, farmers, and the local community.

A note from David Sulgalski aka The Polish Ambassador...

“For the past 5 years I have been touring as an electronic music composer and performer. It has been a joy, an honor, and an evolution to share my music with an audience that seems to put progressive ideas and community at the forefront of it's collective consciousness. I'm fully aware that without the support and participation of YOU GUYS this project would cease to exist. It's for that reason I feel indebted to the supporters of this project to use TPA as a platform to facilitate positive impact. 

In speaking with so many of you guys at shows, festivals, and random encounters in the street, it has become clear that this music scene is ripe for some change. It's also clear that you guys want to be a part of it. In fact, the type of change that we are calling for will only work if you guys ARE involved. It's a collective movement that can be accelerated through artists, but ultimately comes down to the people--YOU.

People are attending concerts and festivals by the tens of thousands yet it is rare to see this energy mobilizing for a greater cause, a cause that directly affects the local community that is hosting the event. Yep, I'm with you. The party, the celebration is awesome. Shaking booty with your friends is heaps of fun. I've been doing it for the past 4 years. I know. But now, I'm longing for something more. Are you?

Can impact and celebration co-exist in the same environment? Can community work parties and projects culminate in ecstatic dance party celebrations? Can we remember that festival culture all began with harvests where people busted their ass for a week(s), all of it culminating in a community celebration known as a festival?

I'm curious. My gut tells me that this is the evolution that we are moving toward within our music scene. Realizing within ourselves that in giving, we are actually receiving. Understanding that it can feel so, so good to build with people to create something greater than our independent selves before or after we celebrate. Remembering that before anything else comes reverence for the earth, for without the earth we would not be. Simple truths.

I've decided to dedicate this Fall tour to these ideas. Perhaps we can consider this a seed that is being planted to inspire other artists to do something similar. Maybe it's an experiment. We have a question and this experiment might be the beginning of an answer.

We're embarking on a 30 city tour and we've linked up with a team of permaculture teachers, urban farmers,  community organizers, and network weavers to add to the already growing team of musicians, lyricists, and visual artists that make up Jumpsuit Records and The Polish Ambassador experience.  We’ll be teaching permaculture at shows through spoken word, video, and resources for people to take home; bringing local groups and organizations out to put a focus on the change they’re making in each city; and hosting impact days to build community projects.  Pushing Through the Pavement is taking action to transform the places where we live.  

The money you donate to this campaign will allow us to do all of this - to bring the teachers and organizers on the road, to provide materials for audiences and local project days, to document the process and publish it online, and to keep everyone healthy and taken care of along the way - to be a first step in bringing about this transformation.

In closing, I ask that if you share and support one thing from TPA this year, let it be this campaign. Every show I've ever played, every song I've ever produced, every fan I've ever connected with, it's really all led up to this. This project has become something greater than the music that's come through it, not because of me or you, but because of an open invitation to co-create together. It's my intention to extend that invitation even further. Will you create transformational party 2.0 with us?”-David Sugalski AKA The Polish Ambassador



Summary

This October, The Polish Ambassador partners with a team of permaculture educators and community organizers to bring Pushing Through the Pavement: A Permaculture Action Tour to venues in major cities across the United States. The tour will provide educational presentations and workshops at Polish Ambassador shows and community spaces, facilitate project builds at urban sites, and empower people with tools for bringing about a sustainable and regenerative way of life. 

The tour will be connecting a network of local organizations, permaculture groups, sustainability educators, and food growers that can put the principles of permaculture into action through on-the-ground projects and re-skilling.  Audience members will be encouraged to join “Impact Days” on urban sites following each show that will be immersions focused on sustainability, food justice, ecological education, and regenerative living practices.  Along with hard skills like growing food, collecting rainwater, and building structures, the tour will introduce the equally important aspects of social permaculture: how to work in collaborative groups and organize locally, make decisions, and communicate effectively.


			 

Tour Objectives



To teach audiences about permaculture, regenerative land practices, organic food growing, natural building, rainwater catchment, and living in community. 




To organize impact projects on urban sites in between shows that focus on sustainability, food justice, ecological education, and regenerative living


practices; and get peoples' hands moving to build and plant together. 



To connect people with groups and organizations doing this work in the cities they live in, so that together people can transform the urban landscape, solve local problems, and build community.  




To introduce and weave people into Project Nuevo Mundo’s social network that will keep people connected and allow them continue to engage with innovative permaculture projects, transformational experiences and educational programs around the world through www.ProjectNuevoMundo.org


What is Permaculture? 


Permaculture is the practice of living in a balanced way on the earth; of designing relationships of mutual support between people and the ecosystems we inhabit.  Through the collection of skills and practices that permaculture teaches, people can learn to once again live in a way that fosters healthy human communities and cultivates ecologically diverse and productive habitats for all beings.  


Permaculture practices we will be sharing:




Regenerative Land Care




Organic Food Growing




Food Forests and Perennial Polycultures




Natural Building




Rainwater Catchment and Greywater Recycling




Compost and Soil Building




Appropriate Technology




Neighborhood Placemaking




Transforming the Urban Landscape




Living in Community






The Goal


The goal of the Permaculture Action Tour is to inspire and empower people with the tools and know how of co-creating a sustainable and regenerative world.  Through bridging live music with earth-based practices and collective action, we will bring a new sense of awareness, community, and personal potential to each audience member who attends The Polish Ambassador shows–offering a way to make an impact towards positive change where they live while having fun.  This tour will be one step of many in making our cities greener, healthier, and happier places to live through the action of community.


The Need 


The problems we face today have surpassed controversy and uncertainty. We are seeing the effects of over-consumption and resource exploitation in land degradation and the endangerment of wildlife, ancient cultures, and soil everywhere we look.  These imbalances reverberate out into our human communities as well where we witness poverty, hunger, and disconnection in our cities every day.  It is time that everyone become part of the solution and make small changes within their local communities and it’s time for those with a microphone in hand to empower their listeners to become part of the solution. The Polish Ambassador has stepped up to the plate to be that voice and collaborate with leaders in the permaculture movement to spark CHANGE.


The Impact

The impact that this tour will have is infinite and will continue beyond the tour itself. Each individual has an immense power to change world around them.  If each audience member is empowered to lead or take on a project of their own, another entire group of people will benefit, and soon an entire city. This tour has the potential to create millions of ripples of action towards healing the planet.  We, the people, are the power behind making our cities greener, happier, and healthier places as we improve relationships between each other and the earth. Our team is ecstatic to see the immense impact this tour will have on thousands of people and the permaculture movement it will accelerate.

</center></div>","Green is Good. Green is Vital. Green is Now.Gasoline is already the fuel of the past. The search is on, but
what will the fuel of the future be?  Zero Pollution Motors, LLC predicts compressed air



That's right! Air. Zero Pollution Motors (ZPM) is poised to produce cars powered by compressed air by the second half of 2015. 
As the first U.S. licensee for Luxembourg-based MDI (www.mdi.lu), developer of
the AIRPod, ZPM has attained the rights to build a production plant in the
United States.The AIRPod is the solution to urban pollution and urban
mobility. With its small size, a tiny price, zero pollution, and a fun
and futuristic design, AIRPod marks a turning point in the landscape of urban
transportation. It is a real breath of fresh air in cities and the
prelude to travel without pollution. A car that runs on air eliminates the
air pollution of internal combustion engines. Air is a more
sustainable option than electric because of the absence of large toxic
batteries, which are expensive to produce and end up in landfills. A compressed air tank can be refilled in the same amount of time as a gas tank,
as opposed to 8-10 hours of charging required for electric cars. Air can be compressed by solar, wind or hydroelectric power, virtually eliminating
any carbon footprint in the operation of the AIRPod.


Zero Pollution Motors, LLC is launching in the United States the
urban car of the future, now.
 
Technology

How can compressed air fuel a car?  The laws of physics
dictate that uncontained gases will fill any given space. The easiest way to
see this in action is to inflate a balloon. The elastic skin of the balloon
holds the air tightly inside, but the moment you use a pin to create a hole in
the balloon's surface, the air expands outward turning the potential energy of
the compressed air inside the balloon into a burst of useable kinetic
energy. This may sound dangerous, but the AIRPod is entirely safe.  The tanks are made of carbon fibre.  In the event of a crash the tanks will split, releasing the air in a controlled and safe manner, with zero chance of an explosion of any kind. Compressing a gas into a small space is a way to store energy. When the
gas expands again, that energy is released to do work. This principle is the
basis behind what makes an air car run. 

Business Strategy








Zero Pollution Motors, LLC will be following the MDI “Dealer – Manufacturer – Partner” concept by creating turnkey micro production factories to manufacture their vehicles locally in regions throughout the United States. Unlike the huge classic assembly factories, these plants will sell 80% of the vehicles in the same geographic location they are produced. In the MDI production concept, the suppliers are chosen in a way to reduce costs, logistics and freight.  All the purchases are managed at the MDI central purchasing unit, to benefit from the advantages of bulk buying.
Hawaii is the anticipated location for the initial production plant. Hawaii is the most fossil fuel dependent state in the nation and importing oil to meet the demand is not sustainable. The Hawaii Clean Energy Initiative (HCEI), a federal-state-private partnership, is charting a new course toward energy independence. This environment is perfect for introducing compressed air technology to the US. Following are the benefits derived from using micro production factories and the ""Dealer - Manufacturer - Partner"" concept compared to conventional production system: 








Ecological Benefits



Only one third of
the ground surface is necessary


Better distribution of the energy used for production


No
pollution due to the transport of the finished products



Economic Benefits



The currency
remains in the country


Creation of local employment


Customers buy cars
that are produced locally (especially public services)


Reduction of import duties/taxes (very high in some countries)


Logistics expenses are drastically reduced

No cost associated with storage of spare parts


Traction


Successful prototypes have been developed.

 Tata Motors Limited, the india based multinational automotive manufacturing company has completed proof of the technical concept in their compressed air vehicles in May, 2012.


The AIRPod was well received when tested at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport

Our website has had tens of thousands of visitors. We even registered more than 3,400 interested parties in one day during a special event!
The AIRPod has received formal interest from the NY Taxi and limousine commission, USPS, Club Car and various other delivery operators.
Actor Rocky Carroll (NCIS, Chicago Hope, Roc) is our official sponsors.

Wildlife in Africa is under severe threat. Many animals are on the verge of extinction while others enjoy little attention or protection.   In South Africa, hundreds  of thousands of small and large wild animals die every year as a result of lethal methods used to keep predators off farming lands.    
Few alternatives  are available to farmers who strive to secure their livelihoods amidst a widespread conflict affecting the business of meat production.  It is estimated that predators attacking livestock  costs farmers $125 million every year and farmers are desperate to find a win-win solution in addressing this human- wildlife conflict .  Our farmers are as eager as we are to find a way to protect livestock from
predators.   With your support we can make a difference.

What We Are DoingWe are working with scientists, veterinarians, farmers and our partner, the Cape Leopard Trust to find a scientifically tested solution for farmers to live in harmony with predators and produce red meat in a truly WILDLIFE FRIENDLY manner.  To do this we are gathering scientific data
and testing the effectiveness of Anatolian guard dogs and a combination of dogs and shephards to protect livestock from danger.  Our Anatolian guard dogs are bred on the grounds of Namaqua National Park  in South Africa’s Northern Cape.  When they are old enough to be separated from their mothers we place the puppies on farms. They have strong protective instincts and they quickly bond with the livestock they grow up with.This bond never dwindles but gets stronger and stronger as they mature. Anatolian guard dogs never tire of their duties, checking up on their flocks throughout the night and walking amidst their flock to safeguard them from predators. The
dogs patrol where their flock graze and mark the area with scat and urine to

While we are learning and monitoring how effective Anatolian dog guarding is - so too are we researching the behavior of predators in an effort to understand and plan for their reactions.  To do this, a team of scientists that includes staff, partners and volunteers, monitor carefully placed camera’s that take photos triggered by movement.  This has allowed us
to estimate predator and prey abundance and diversity. We also capture, GPS collar

<p>Exciting news from the Heart of the World - La Sierra Nevada de Santa
Marta in Colombia:</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/430985/files/20140313092917-John_Writing_-50k.jpg?1394728157"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> What started two years ago as a simple project to research and write a
book with the indigenous Elders of Colombia's Sierra Nevada has, not
surprisingly, taken many turns. It has now evolved into a multi-faceted project
that includes the writing of a novel that will share the environmental and
spiritual message of the Elders, plus a feature-length motion picture
adaptation of the book, and now a significant opportunity to help return sacred
lands to the indigenous peoples of the mountain.</p>
<p> The writing of the book continues and now includes adapting it to form
the basis of a major motion picture that will greatly expand the audience for
the spiritual and environmental message of the Elders.</p>
<p> I originally intended to live with the indigenous peoples and learn
from them in their villages. That has happened, but now I actually have a group
of indigenous boys - designated future Elders - living with me in my village!
They are attending the local public school to learn more of the world beyond
their world and to learn English so that they can participate in spreading
their spiritual and environmental message.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/430991/files/20140313093042-Los_Tres_Amigos_Original.JPG?1394728242"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<h2>It Takes a Village</h2>
<p> Recently I had the opportunity of spending some time living with them
in their village - a 'new' village, built in the traditional manner in just the
past few years. The Kogi, Arhuaco and Wiwa peoples are thriving, in spite of
all the pressure to encroach upon their sacred lands and damage our Earth
Mother - la madre tierra.</p>
<p> Much of their sacred land has been occupied over the years by squatters
- <i>campesinos</i> - farmers who simply moved in and fenced off a part of the sacred
lands and began slash-and-burn deforestation and the planting of commercial
crops.</p>
<p> While the new tenants have no legal right to the indigenous land they
now occupy, removing them and restoring the land to the indigenous peoples is
not easy.<br/></p>
<p> I have recently been offered an exceptional opportunity to just that. A
compaseno couple who the indigenous people of the area respect has offered to
turn his land over to the Arhuaco and depart, providing the indigenous with an
opportunity to expand their village and farm the very fertile valley.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/431035/files/20140313095418-_-Huts_in_the_valley.jpg?1394729658"" src="""" style=""width: 568px; height: 426px;""/></p>
<p> For only the equivalent of four thousand US dollars I can, in effect,
'buy' this entire valley back and return it to its rightful owners, the
indigenous peoples of la Sierra. The purchase price is a small payment for the
extensive improvements that have been made to the property and will ensure that
the property is vacated and returned to the indigenous peoples as a home for
their growing traditional community.</p>
<p> I am inviting you to participate in this exciting opportunity to right
at least a few of the wrongs that have been vested on the indigenous community
over the past five hundred years. And I promise that I will keep you informed
on all the progress as a new village takes form. In fact, I invite you to come
to Colombia one day and be welcomed into the village yourself, to spend a few
days experiencing the community you have helped create.</p>
<p> Your small contribution will be used to buy back the land and improvements
and to begin replacing the buildings with new traditional huts and establishing
new traditional farms and gardens.</p>
<p> Below is an updated version of the original IndieGoGo.com funding
campaign and description. The project has grown significantly since this was
first launched two years ago, but it still gives you an idea of what the
indigenous community and I are hoping to accomplish together.</p>

And now it will also be a major motion picture! Christian Castagno is a teenager living in New York when his mother dies of cancer. She leaves behind an illustrated handwritten letter, written when he was conceived, describing the life adventures that await him. Chris tells the story of being led by a talking butterfly, in a series of what may or may not have been dreams, to a mystical mountain in South America where he meets a wise teacher, the elder of a lost tribe of indigenous peoples who fled the coast at the time of Columbus - a people who believe themselves to be the Heart of the World.

Exciting news from the Heart of the World - La Sierra Nevada de Santa
Marta in Colombia:


 What started two years ago as a simple project to research and write a
book with the indigenous Elders of Colombia's Sierra Nevada has, not
surprisingly, taken many turns. It has now evolved into a multi-faceted project
that includes the writing of a novel that will share the environmental and
spiritual message of the Elders, plus a feature-length motion picture
adaptation of the book, and now a significant opportunity to help return sacred
lands to the indigenous peoples of the mountain.
 The writing of the book continues and now includes adapting it to form
the basis of a major motion picture that will greatly expand the audience for
the spiritual and environmental message of the Elders.
 I originally intended to live with the indigenous peoples and learn
from them in their villages. That has happened, but now I actually have a group
of indigenous boys - designated future Elders - living with me in my village!
They are attending the local public school to learn more of the world beyond
their world and to learn English so that they can participate in spreading
their spiritual and environmental message.



It Takes a Village
 Recently I had the opportunity of spending some time living with them
in their village - a 'new' village, built in the traditional manner in just the
past few years. The Kogi, Arhuaco and Wiwa peoples are thriving, in spite of
all the pressure to encroach upon their sacred lands and damage our Earth
Mother - la madre tierra.
 Much of their sacred land has been occupied over the years by squatters
- campesinos - farmers who simply moved in and fenced off a part of the sacred
lands and began slash-and-burn deforestation and the planting of commercial
crops.
 While the new tenants have no legal right to the indigenous land they
now occupy, removing them and restoring the land to the indigenous peoples is
not easy.
 I have recently been offered an exceptional opportunity to just that. A
compaseno couple who the indigenous people of the area respect has offered to
turn his land over to the Arhuaco and depart, providing the indigenous with an
opportunity to expand their village and farm the very fertile valley.




 For only the equivalent of four thousand US dollars I can, in effect,
'buy' this entire valley back and return it to its rightful owners, the
indigenous peoples of la Sierra. The purchase price is a small payment for the
extensive improvements that have been made to the property and will ensure that
the property is vacated and returned to the indigenous peoples as a home for
their growing traditional community.
 I am inviting you to participate in this exciting opportunity to right
at least a few of the wrongs that have been vested on the indigenous community
over the past five hundred years. And I promise that I will keep you informed
on all the progress as a new village takes form. In fact, I invite you to come
to Colombia one day and be welcomed into the village yourself, to spend a few
days experiencing the community you have helped create.
 Your small contribution will be used to buy back the land and improvements
and to begin replacing the buildings with new traditional huts and establishing
new traditional farms and gardens.
 Below is an updated version of the original IndieGoGo.com funding
campaign and description. The project has grown significantly since this was
first launched two years ago, but it still gives you an idea of what the
indigenous community and I are hoping to accomplish together.
Do You Believe a Book - and a Movie - Can Change the World? I do.Do you remember reading a special book when you were younger - one that changed your life. I do. If you believe in the power of a book, as I do, I invite you to participate in changing the life of a young reader, maybe thousands of young readers - and in saving the planet - by supporting this very special book - and movie - project.JOURNEY TO THE HEART OF THE WORLD will be an engaging young adult fantasy novel based on a true story. And now it will also be a major motion picture! Christian Castagno is a teenager living in New York when his mother dies of cancer. She leaves behind an illustrated handwritten letter, written when he was conceived, describing the life adventures that await him. Chris tells the story of being led by a talking butterfly, in a series of what may or may not have been dreams, to a mystical mountain in South America where he meets a wise teacher, the elder of a lost tribe of indigenous peoples who fled the coast at the time of Columbus - a people who believe themselves to be the Heart of the World. The spiritual and environmental teachings of the shamanic elder trigger several dream-like heroic adventures through Chris’s past and future lives, including being present as the Spanish conquistadors land on the Colombian coast and participating in conversations between Thomas Edison  and Henry Ford. In the end, the hero comes to understand the true purpose of life and the prescription for saving the life of his endangered Earth Mother.ABOUT THE AUTHOR – JOHN LUNDIN - AND AN UPDATE FROM THE FIELDJohn Lundin with the Mamos of La Sierra Nevada I am the author of THE NEW MANDALA - Eastern Wisdom for Western Living, written in collaboration with His Holiness the Dalai Lama, a book that presented the message of the Buddha to western readers. I have recently been invited by the elders - the Mamos - of the indigenous descendants of the Tairona of the Sierra Nevada in Colombia - people who fled the Spanish invasion in the 1500s and whose culture has remain largely unchanged for five hundred years - to live with them and to learn from them and to write a book that will share their urgent message, the message that our Earth Mother is in trouble and that we are the only ones who can save her. I have chosen to write a young adult fantasy novel, not unlike Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings or The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, one that will appeal to young adult readers since they are the planet's only hope for the future. It will not be a ""preachy"" book, but it will be an engaging fantasy adventure story with a serious message, one that young people will want to read and one that parents and teachers will encourage them to read.


Update from the field, March 2014: A production company has been formed and is already working on assembling a team to bring the book to the wide screen. The research continues, the teachings from the elders are more intense, and the actual writing of the book is well underway. Several chapters have already been written, and Chapter One of JOURNEY TO THE HEART OF THE WORLD can now be previewed in its entirety at my website, www.JohnLundin.com




JOURNEY TO THE HEART OF THE WORLD - When a teenager from the Catskills is led by a talking butterfly to the mountain home of a lost tribe in the jungles of South America, the elders’ sacred teachings initiate dream-like adventures through his past and future lives, revealing the secrets of their spiritual and environmental message – and the purpose of life.

<h3>AU SUJET DE CE PROJET (ABOUT THIS PROJECT)</h3>
<p>*ENGLISH VERSION BELOW*</p>
<ul><li><u><strong>POURQUOI</strong></u></li></ul>
<p><strong>La Chatterie Anglaise</strong> est la plus grande chatterie, des 8 chatteries de la SPA Vauclusienne (Isle Sur La Sorgue, France). Environ<strong> 120 chats s'y côtoient</strong> actuellement, de 1 an à 15 ans, avec des profils différents, des pathologies (ou non) diverses, des histoires plus ou moins particulières, et  cela nécessite donc des <strong>BESOINS DIFFERENTS et APPROPRIES</strong> pour chacun.</p>
<p>Faute de moyens, la Chatterie Anglaise est devenue un peu <strong>le 'fourre-tout' des chatteries</strong>, et accueille donc en majorité des<strong> profils particuliers </strong>tels que des chats craintifs, très timides, bagarreurs, ou avec une pathologie particulière, ou même des groupes de chats errants que le Refuge a sorti de la rue ou de la maltraitance, et qui ont très peu connus le contact humain.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Des chats donc, qui ont<strong> besoin d'attentions particulières et qui demandent un travail particulier.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hors la structure de la chatterie ne me permet pas d'apporter tout ce que je souhaiterai apporter à mes loulous.</p>
<p>C'est une grande chatterie certes ; il y a de l'espace, un grand extérieur avec des arbres et des intérieurs, mais justement un ""trop"" d'espace unique pour une multitudes de profils différents qui n'ont pas à être mélangés ensembles.</p>
<p>* A savoir que dans une petite chatterie, un chat très timide, voire craintif, demanderait quelques mois de<strong> sociabilisation </strong>; à la Chatterie Anglaise, cela me demande pour certains 1 année, voire 2, voire des chats qui ne progressent pratiquement pas et restent méfiants de l'être humain. Et cela me frustre énormément car mon but et mon souhait, pour chacun, est qu'ils trouvent une famille et un foyer chaleureux.</p>
<p>* Autre problème rencontré par ce grand espace non structuré, et également une autre frustration, c'est<strong> lorsqu'un chat doit être soigné </strong>et qu'il fait partie de ces chats craintifs et ne se laisse donc pas attraper. S'entame alors une course folle dans le terrain, pendant parfois 20 minutes ou sur plusieurs jours si échecs, engendrant du stress au pauvre loulou.</p>
<p>* Au niveau de <strong>certaines pathologies,</strong> la chatterie compte quelques loulous qui ont besoin de pâté en plus des croquettes. N'ayant pas d'autres moyens, je fonctionne donc avec le SAS d'entrée de la chatterie pour les mettre à part et pouvoir leur donner tranquillement, mais cela demande toute une organisation, non pratique, qui fait perdre beaucoup de temps, et qui frustrent les autres pauvres loulous qui assistent à la scène et sont également en demande de pâté.</p>
<p>* Le fait, enfin, qu'il s'agisse d'une grande structure avec autant de chats, <strong>freine le peu d'éventuelles d'adoptions </strong>que nous pouvons déjà y espérer. Combien de fois ai-je entendu : ""Il y a trop de chats, je ne sais plus où donner de la tête/ je ne sais pas lequel choisir !"", les personnes repartant pour la plupart sans avoir choisi de compagnon.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><u><b>DES SOLUTIONS</b></u></li></ul>
<p>J'aimerai donc, grâce à votre aide, <strong>restructurer la Chatterie en diverses espaces, afin de répondre au mieux aux besoins des loulous</strong>, et ainsi de leur donner de réelles chances d'adoption :</p>
<p>* <strong>1 ESPACE SOCIABILISATION/VISITEURS/MISE EN AVANT</strong>, qui sera édifié afin d'y accueillir les visiteurs dans un espace plus restreint. Un espace où se côtoieraient des chats sociabilisés ou en cours de sociabilisation (très timides, craintifs, etc..) et permettant ainsi aux plus timides qui ne font jamais la démarche d'aller vers les gens, d'être sociabilisés, de leur redonner confiance en l'être humain, d'êtres vus et mis en avant, et de faire craquer des coeurs par leur douceur et leur gentillesse ..</p>
<p>*<strong> 1 ESPACE ""BESOINS PARTICULIERS""</strong> (Seniors, gingivites etc..), qui sera élaboré afin que nos loulous en besoin d'un régime particulier (pâté, alimentation adaptée..) puissent avoir accès librement et tout le long de la journée (contrairement à actuellement une fois par jour) à une alimentation humide adaptée. Cet espace me permettra également de pouvoir essayer quelques traitements homéopathiques ou phytothérapiques pour le confort de certaines pathologies, et ainsi les stabiliser ; chose que je ne peux absolument pas mettre en place dans les conditions actuelles.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>COMMENT</u></strong></p>
<p>Pour la création de ces espaces, il nous faudra donc acheter 1 ou 2 chalets de jardin pour que les chats soient à l'abri, de quoi isoler le(s) chalet(s), de quoi faire une (des) dalle(s) en béton pour y mettre le(s) chalet(s), des portes/ construction de SAS, des arrangements intérieurs/extérieurs (ils auront une partie chalet et une partie terrain), des plaques de recouvrements pour abriter les parties terrains..</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Si notre but est atteint et même dépassé, l'argent récolté en plus sera utilisé pour tous les autres aménagements/réparations nécessaires dans la chatterie (humidité, besoins en matériels..) ainsi que dans le Refuge .. et il y en a !!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>COMMENT INDIEGOGO FONCTIONNE</strong></u><strong> : </strong></p>
<p>Vous décidez combien vous souhaitez contribuer, et choisissez sur votre droite, une Contrepartie associée.</p>
<p>Une fois la campagne terminée, Indiegogo retire 5% de Frais sur la somme atteinte. Si le but n'est pas atteint, les frais s'élèvent alors à environ 9% ! Ce qui est énorme et motive donc grandement à faire un maximum pour y parvenir.</p>
<p>S'ajoutent à ces frais, 3% de frais de traitement pour les cartes de Crédit + 30 cents par transaction, et enfin, 25 dollars de frais de virement (+ ou - selon les banques).</p>
<p><br/><strong><u>D'AUTRES FACONS D'AIDER</u> :</strong></p>
<p>Vous auriez souhaité nous donner un petit coup de pattes mais ne pouvez pas participer financièrement ? Ne vous en faites pas, il y a toujours un moyen d'aider ! ;)</p>

<p><u><strong>WHY THIS PROJECT</strong></u><strong> :</strong></p>
<p><strong>L'Anglaise</strong> is the biggest cattery, from the 8 catteries of the animal shelter SPA Vauclusienne (Isle Sur La Sorgue, France). About<strong> 120 cats</strong> currently live there, from 1 year to 15 years old, <strong>with different profiles</strong>, various pathologies (or not), more or less specific stories, and this therefore <strong>requires different and appropriate needs for everyone.</strong></p>
<p>Due to a lack of resources, the English Cattery has become a bit of a <strong>cattery 'catch-all'</strong>, and therefore mostly hosts <strong>particular profiles</strong> such as fearful cats, very shy, brawlers, or with a particular pathology, or even groups of stray cats that the animal shelter has taken out of the street or abuse, and have very little known human contact.</p>
<p><strong>Cats therefore, who need special attention and who ask for a particular job.</strong></p>
<p>And the structure of the cattery does not allow me to bring all that I wish to bring to my kitties.</p>
<p>It is a great cattery certainly; there is space, a large exterior with trees and interiors, but precisely a ""too"" unique space for a multitude of different profiles that do not have to be mixed together.</p>
<p>* To know that in a small cattery, a very shy cat, even fearful, would require a few months of <strong>socialization</strong>; at the cattery L'Anglaise, it requires me for some 1 year, or even 2, even cats that hardly progress and remain suspicious of the human being. And it frustrates me a lot because my goal and wish for everyone is to find a family and a warm home.</p>
<p>* Another problem with this large unstructured space, and also another frustration, is when a cat <strong>needs to be cured</strong> and is one of those cautious cats and therefore does not get caught. Then begins a crazy race in the field, sometimes for 20 minutes or several days if failures, causing stress to the poor kitty.</p>
<p>* At the level of <strong>certain pathologies</strong>, the cattery counts some cats which need wet food in addition to dry food. Having no other means, I therefore work with the ""SAS"" entrance of the cattery to set them apart and be able to give them quietly, but it requires a whole organization, not practical, which is wasting a lot of time, and who frustrate the other poor kitties who attend the scene and are also in demand for pie.</p>
<p>* The fact, finally, that it is a large structure with so many cats, <strong>slows down the few possible adoptions that we can already hope for</strong>. How many times have I heard: ""There are too many cats, I do not know where to turn my head / I do not know which one to choose!"", The people leaving for the most part without having chosen a companion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>THE SOLUTIONS</strong></u><strong> :</strong></p>
<p><br/>I would like, thanks to your help, to <strong>restructure the Cattery in various spaces</strong>, in order to best meet the needs of the cats, and thus to give them real chances of adoption:</p>
<p><strong>* 1 SOCIABILIZATION / VISITORS / ADVANCED AREA</strong>, which will be built to welcome visitors in a smaller space. A space where sociabilized or socializing cats (very shy, fearful, etc ..) would rub shoulders and thus allowing the shy ones who never make the approach to go to people, to be sociabilized, to give them back confidence in the human being, beings seen and put forward, and to crack hearts by their sweetness and kindness ..</p>
<p><strong>* 1 ""PARTICULAR NEEDS"" AREA</strong> (Seniors, gingivitis etc ..), which will be developed so that our kitties in need of a particular diet (wet food, adapted food ..) can have free access and all the day long ( unlike at present once a day) to a suitable wet diet. This space will also allow me to try some homeopathic or phytotherapic treatments for the comfort of certain pathologies, and thus stabilize them; something that I absolutely can not put in place under the current conditions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>HOW</strong></u><strong> :</strong></p>
<p>For the creation of these spaces, we will have to buy 1 or 2 garden cottages so that the cats are safe, what to isolate the (s) cottage (s), what to do a (the) slab (s) ) in concrete to put the (s) cottage (s), doors / construction of SAS, interior / exterior arrangements (they will have part cottage and part ground), plates of coverings to shelter the parts ground ..</p>

*ENGLISH VERSION BELOW*
POURQUOI
La Chatterie Anglaise est la plus grande chatterie, des 8 chatteries de la SPA Vauclusienne (Isle Sur La Sorgue, France). Environ 120 chats s'y côtoient actuellement, de 1 an à 15 ans, avec des profils différents, des pathologies (ou non) diverses, des histoires plus ou moins particulières, et  cela nécessite donc des BESOINS DIFFERENTS et APPROPRIES pour chacun.
Faute de moyens, la Chatterie Anglaise est devenue un peu le 'fourre-tout' des chatteries, et accueille donc en majorité des profils particuliers tels que des chats craintifs, très timides, bagarreurs, ou avec une pathologie particulière, ou même des groupes de chats errants que le Refuge a sorti de la rue ou de la maltraitance, et qui ont très peu connus le contact humain.
 
Des chats donc, qui ont besoin d'attentions particulières et qui demandent un travail particulier.
 
Hors la structure de la chatterie ne me permet pas d'apporter tout ce que je souhaiterai apporter à mes loulous.
C'est une grande chatterie certes ; il y a de l'espace, un grand extérieur avec des arbres et des intérieurs, mais justement un ""trop"" d'espace unique pour une multitudes de profils différents qui n'ont pas à être mélangés ensembles.
* A savoir que dans une petite chatterie, un chat très timide, voire craintif, demanderait quelques mois de sociabilisation ; à la Chatterie Anglaise, cela me demande pour certains 1 année, voire 2, voire des chats qui ne progressent pratiquement pas et restent méfiants de l'être humain. Et cela me frustre énormément car mon but et mon souhait, pour chacun, est qu'ils trouvent une famille et un foyer chaleureux.
* Autre problème rencontré par ce grand espace non structuré, et également une autre frustration, c'est lorsqu'un chat doit être soigné et qu'il fait partie de ces chats craintifs et ne se laisse donc pas attraper. S'entame alors une course folle dans le terrain, pendant parfois 20 minutes ou sur plusieurs jours si échecs, engendrant du stress au pauvre loulou.
* Au niveau de certaines pathologies, la chatterie compte quelques loulous qui ont besoin de pâté en plus des croquettes. N'ayant pas d'autres moyens, je fonctionne donc avec le SAS d'entrée de la chatterie pour les mettre à part et pouvoir leur donner tranquillement, mais cela demande toute une organisation, non pratique, qui fait perdre beaucoup de temps, et qui frustrent les autres pauvres loulous qui assistent à la scène et sont également en demande de pâté.
* Le fait, enfin, qu'il s'agisse d'une grande structure avec autant de chats, freine le peu d'éventuelles d'adoptions que nous pouvons déjà y espérer. Combien de fois ai-je entendu : ""Il y a trop de chats, je ne sais plus où donner de la tête/ je ne sais pas lequel choisir !"", les personnes repartant pour la plupart sans avoir choisi de compagnon.
 
DES SOLUTIONS
J'aimerai donc, grâce à votre aide, restructurer la Chatterie en diverses espaces, afin de répondre au mieux aux besoins des loulous, et ainsi de leur donner de réelles chances d'adoption :
* 1 ESPACE SOCIABILISATION/VISITEURS/MISE EN AVANT, qui sera édifié afin d'y accueillir les visiteurs dans un espace plus restreint. Un espace où se côtoieraient des chats sociabilisés ou en cours de sociabilisation (très timides, craintifs, etc..) et permettant ainsi aux plus timides qui ne font jamais la démarche d'aller vers les gens, d'être sociabilisés, de leur redonner confiance en l'être humain, d'êtres vus et mis en avant, et de faire craquer des coeurs par leur douceur et leur gentillesse ..
* 1 ESPACE ""BESOINS PARTICULIERS"" (Seniors, gingivites etc..), qui sera élaboré afin que nos loulous en besoin d'un régime particulier (pâté, alimentation adaptée..) puissent avoir accès librement et tout le long de la journée (contrairement à actuellement une fois par jour) à une alimentation humide adaptée. Cet espace me permettra également de pouvoir essayer quelques traitements homéopathiques ou phytothérapiques pour le confort de certaines pathologies, et ainsi les stabiliser ; chose que je ne peux absolument pas mettre en place dans les conditions actuelles.
 
COMMENT
Pour la création de ces espaces, il nous faudra donc acheter 1 ou 2 chalets de jardin pour que les chats soient à l'abri, de quoi isoler le(s) chalet(s), de quoi faire une (des) dalle(s) en béton pour y mettre le(s) chalet(s), des portes/ construction de SAS, des arrangements intérieurs/extérieurs (ils auront une partie chalet et une partie terrain), des plaques de recouvrements pour abriter les parties terrains..
 
Si notre but est atteint et même dépassé, l'argent récolté en plus sera utilisé pour tous les autres aménagements/réparations nécessaires dans la chatterie (humidité, besoins en matériels..) ainsi que dans le Refuge .. et il y en a !!
 
COMMENT INDIEGOGO FONCTIONNE : 
Vous décidez combien vous souhaitez contribuer, et choisissez sur votre droite, une Contrepartie associée.
Une fois la campagne terminée, Indiegogo retire 5% de Frais sur la somme atteinte. Si le but n'est pas atteint, les frais s'élèvent alors à environ 9% ! Ce qui est énorme et motive donc grandement à faire un maximum pour y parvenir.
S'ajoutent à ces frais, 3% de frais de traitement pour les cartes de Crédit + 30 cents par transaction, et enfin, 25 dollars de frais de virement (+ ou - selon les banques).
D'AUTRES FACONS D'AIDER :
Vous auriez souhaité nous donner un petit coup de pattes mais ne pouvez pas participer financièrement ? Ne vous en faites pas, il y a toujours un moyen d'aider ! ;)


PARTAGEZ un MAX environ une fois par semaine si cela vous est possible (le projet sera alimenté chaque semaine ou presque, avec de nouvelles vidéos, informations etc..) ; vous pouvez utiliser les outils de partage ou copier-coller l'adresse internet du Projet, et les envoyer par E-mail à votre entourage, et partager sur les réseaux sociaux, etc..,

<h3>What is an Angel Tree?</h3>
<p>Angel Trees begin to appear during the winter holidays. They inspire hope. They give gifts to children who are less fortunate, who may not have a single present under the tree on Christmas morning. They simply allow you to become Santa for a child in need. </p>
<p>These trees are dressed in paper ornaments in the shapes of bells or stars and most commonly, angels. They list a child's name, age, and what they are asking Santa for Christmas. Some ask for toys and some ask for clothes. </p>
<p>Each ornament is designed to be picked up by people like you and I who go out and buy the desired present and turn it in ""From Santa"" for the child to receive on Christmas morning.</p>
<h3>Holiday Angel Tree</h3>
<p>Every year, I remove at least one, sometimes two, angels from the Angel Tree. As much as I feel good to be providing two children with presents from santa on Christmas morning, I also feel sad for all the angels left over. All the names with wishes that are left unfufilled. All the smiles that will never happen because they weren't picked. This year, I want to empty as many angel trees as I can.</p>
<div>
<h3>Give the Gift of Giving</h3>
<p>The current goal is set at $500.00. Any and all contributions are helpful. Every penny will go to the presents for the Angels.</p>
<p>The difference a small donation can make is more than one can imagine. Figure, the amount spent on a gift, $10-20, could leave an everlasting impression on a child. That 10 or 20 dollars will bring joy, happiness, hope, faith, to that child's life. Seeing their present under the tree on Christmas morning will bring a bright smile that is worth more than money can buy. A sense of pride. When you think about it, a small amount of money can change someone's life.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>If Not Here, Where?</h3>
<p>If you decide not to donate to this fundraiser, you can always find an Angel Tree in your hometown and pick out a present yourself. However, I know that some people don't have time to run these extra errands, so why not let me? </p>
<h3>The Perfect Christmas Present</h3>
<p>This is something that brings joy to my heart. I have no problem going out and buying the gifts myself. In fact, personally, it would be the best Christmas present I could ever receive.</p>
<h3>$25 Gift Card Contest</h3>
<p>Upon donating, you will be entered into a contest to win a $25 gift card to any store of your choosing. The winner will be chosen in December, right before Christmas. This is my Christmas present to you :) Thank you for your donations!</p>

</div>","We are focusing our efforts to
creatively inspire those who can have the greatest immediate impact - the men and women who
enforce the laws, and can put illegal shark fishermen behind bars. Before
making the film, Hugo, our producer from Sea Shepherd said, ""If we can't bring
these environmental lawyers to Galapagos and take them diving, then we must
make them a film, and bring the sharks to their offices.""We hope you can share the good news - that the spanish film has already premiered at an international congress to 130 public prosecutors and environmental lawyers representing more than 16 countries. We also gave them 900 copies to have and share, and everyone was pleased. This means the largest body of environmental lawyers in Latin America now knows why sharks are worth a lot more alive than dead.
After 2 years of shooting in 7 countries, the films are ready.
This approach has never been done before. While most films are intended to A,
make money and B, educate consumers, neither of these will have an immediate
effect of sending more illegal fishermen to jail. Instead, we have partnered with the
Network of Environmental Lawyers of Latin America, and the president of the
organization shares our excitement in our innovative approach to focus on environmental law.Today, our funding goal is required to truly put the film to work, and distribute the film to environmental law firms, environmental law schools, and film festivals. We hope to inspire a stewardship among environmental lawyers to award illegal fishermen prison sentences for ocean related crimes.For the last 3 years, Sea
Shepherd Conservation Society and I have been working on this collaborative
film project.Here you can see my recent TEDx Talk titled ""Becoming the Voice of Shark Conservation."" http://youtu.be/xLC8DxkLL8c    
Sharks are truly amazing
creatures, yet many species like Hammerhead Sharks are on the brink of
extinction because of one expensive soup ingredient – shark fins. A cold reality now
faces us head on – we have already fished out 90% of many species of sharks on planet
earth, and we might have as little as a decade before many shark populations go
extinct.
This scarcity is now putting
huge pressure on the Marine Protected Areas around the planet like the
Galapagos Marine Reserve, Cocos Island National Park, Malpelo Nature Reserve,
and many others. These areas are designed as a sanctuary for sharks and
hundreds of other marine species, yet their peaceful waters are rushed with illegal
shark fishermen every day across Latin America and the rest of the world. 
The decline of sharks will
affect us all because many sharks are a keystone species in their ecosystem,
which has been proven in Hawaii. Furthermore, dolphins are being slaughtered to
be used as shark bait. Shark conservation not only helps the ocean
ecologically, and us economically, but also for the sake of humanity.
We have been able to postpone
funding until now to have a good estimate of the remaining costs to
successfully finish the project within the next 6 months. This includes final
post production, printing DVDs to be distributed among environmental lawyers
and judicial authorities, and the cost to continue sharing both english and
spanish versions across the Americas.
Risks and Challenges
 
Filming a topic as huge as the
slaughter of sharks is serious and difficult.  Speaking with some shark
fishermen can be fun, but on occasion the film crew was warned their lives were
in serious danger. When you have someone gesturing to you by dragging his
closed fist(as if with a knife) across his throat, it makes you feel much safer
around the sharks than the fishermen.
A good lesson learned is that
the fishermen are not all bad—they are merely players in a very bad industry.
By using the law to enforce sustainable management practices, far more people
benefit from a living ocean than a dead one. The shark fin industry will be
stopped within 30 years, it is simply with or without the mass extinction of
sharks.
The best part of the film has
been the collaboration among non-profit organizations, government agencies,
judicial authorities, National Park personnel, tourism companies, and countless
amazingly passionate individuals.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

 ""What we should take care of... take care of the Planet""

My name is Fernando Esteban Martinez and with the support of my team  for audio and  video, I want to contribute with my grain of sand with the time that was given to me.

The best way is to keep it simple!

Project definition:
It is an
international project, more specifically of an European project.There will be made ​​recordings for the movie in 15 different European countries.

With future expectations for achieving another project in the USA.
It consists in
making the largest, artistic and innovative movie in the world, by mixing
rhythm, lyrics, music and videos.With
the main theme: ""Taking care of our
Planet"". And as a secondary theme: ""Let´s  take care of ourselves in order
to be able to understand that we must
protect our planet.""

What
image is promoted?

""The cultural
union, by demonstrating how beautiful is the world where we live in and what should we take care of. Knowing
ourselves, more internally, in order to
achieve in life, more that what we intend, through struggle,  controlled patience and perseverance"". ""How in
reality. we all are one and we remain at the same me, but in different
""universes"".




Why this project?
To make the world a
better place.
We will try by  using a Documentary, at an international
level. We want to continue bringing awareness of the importance of taking care
of the environment and for people to be conscious of this matter, communication
is needed as a fundamental basis.
What we need and

""La comunicación para la concienciación es algo fundamental""

Qué debemos cuidar... Cuida el Planeta.

¿La mejor forma? Mostraros el qué, de forma simple!

Mi nombre es Fernando Esteban Martínez y con el soporte de mi equipo,  video y audio, quiero aportar mi grano de arena, con el tiempo que se me ha dado.

Definición del proyecto:

Se trata de un proyecto internacional, mas  en concreto de un
proyecto europeo.
Se realizarán grabaciones
para el largometraje en 15 países Europeos distintos.





Con vistas al futuro de la realización de otro proyecto en Estados
Unidos.
Consiste
en la realización del largometraje
mas largo, artístico e innovador
existente en el mundo, mediante la mezcla el verso rítmico, la música y la
filmografía.
Con el tema principal ""Cuidemos nuestro Planeta"". Y como
tema secundario ""Cuidémonos a nosotros mismos para poder entender que debemos cuidar nuestro
Planeta"".


¿Qúe imagen se imparte?

""La
unión cultural, mediante la
demostración de lo bello que es el
mundo en que vivimos y, lo que debemos cuidar. El conocerse mas internamente
para conseguir en la vida lo que uno se propone, mediante la lucha, la
constancia y la paciencia controlada.""
“El cómo en realidad todos
somos uno y, permanecemos a un mismo yo, pero en distintos
""universos"".




¿Por qué este proyecto?



Hacer del mundo un lugar mejor.
Nosotros
lo intentaremos mediante un Documental de manera internacional. Queremos seguir
haciendo consciencia de lo importante que es cuidar el medio ambiente y, para
que la gente haga consciencia de ello se necesita comunicación, como base.

""Comunicarea pentru gradul
de conștientizare este fundamentală""

""Având grijă de planeta noastră""

Vă arătăm lucurile simplu!

Numele meu este Fernando Esteban Martinez și cu sprijinul echipei mele pentru audio și video, vreau să contribui cu grăuntele  meu de nisip în timpul în care mi-a fost dat.

Definiție proiect:

Acesta este un proiect internațional,
mai precis un proiect european.
Vor fi făcute înregistrări pentru film în 15 de țări europene diferite.





Cu perspective de viitor în realizarea altor proiecte in Statele Unite.
Acesta constă în a face cel mai
mare, artistic și inovator lungmetraj  din lume,  prin combinarea ritmului, versurilor,  muzicii și clipurilor video.
Cu tema principală ""Având
grijă de planeta noastră"". Și, ca temă secundară ""Să avem grijă de
noi înșine, în scopul de a fi în măsură să înțelegem că trebuie să protejăm
planeta noastră.""


Ce imagine este promovată?

""Uniunea Culturală,
demonstrând cât de frumoasă este lumea în care trăim și de ceea ce ar trebui să
avem grijă. Cunoscându-ne pe noi înșine mai mult pe plan intern, în scopul de a
obține mai mult de la viață decât ceea ce ne-am propus, prin luptă, răbdare
controlată și perseverență"".
Cum în realitate, noi toți sunt
unul și rămânem la același eu, dar în diferite"" universuri "".




De ce acest proiect?

Pentru a face lumea un loc mai
bun.
Vom încerca cu ajutorul unui
documentar, la un nivel internațional. Vrem  în continuare să atragem atenția asupra gradului
de conștientizare a importanței de a avea grijă de mediul înconjurător și
pentru ca oamenii să fie conștienți de această problemă, este nevoie de comunicare
ca o bază fundamentală.

Ceea ce avem nevoie și ceea ce veți obține:

Avem nevoie de sprijin financiar pentru călătoriile noastre,
cazare și masă. Noi vă vom oferi dorința, arta, cunoștințe, lupta și mesajul.

Back in October 2011 I watch Vanishing of the Bees and was shocked... It dawned on me in the last 6 years that I lived in Japan I had maybe seen 2 bee! I wondered how the little fuzzy fellows been affected? I was even more shocked to learn that experts think up to 50% of Japan Bees may have died. Wow! 

Because of the Tsunami this did not get much media play. I decided to start-up Beekeeping Japan startup and bought the best hive and kit with the little money the HelpJapanco Venture Fund had raised and set out to find bees... It took me a week and was shocked again that the one place I found had a 5 year waiting period!

Her name was Katherine Routledge and she travelled from England to Rapa Nui (called Easter Island by early Europeans).</p><p>Routledge’s trip, the 1914 Mana Expedition to Easter Island, was a far-reaching success in terms of human endeavour and scientific research. The team negotiated the 12,000 mile marine journey to Rapa Nui and once there completed a year of ground breaking anthropological field work that when published (<i>The Mystery of Easter Island, Katherine Routledge</i>) introduced the rest of the world to the enchanting Easter Island’s anthropological mysteries. The enigma of the islanders and their Moai statues continue to captivate scientists today.</p><p><i>“Such is Easter Island… All portions of it are accessible; from every part is the wind of heaven; around and above all are boundless sea and sky, infinite space and a great silence. The dweller there is ever listening for he knows not what, feeling unconsciously that he is in the antechamber to something yet more vast which is just beyond his ken.”</i></p><p>Katherine Routledge, The Mystery of Easter Island.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/338764/files/20140130093621-TravellingMoai.jpg?1391103381"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>I discovered Katherine’s extraordinary story when I travelled to Rapa Nui in 2005 to volunteer with a youth involvement programme: <a href=""http://www.terevaka.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">'A Po</a>.

Then I will visit a number of places and ports the Mana called into in South America, and will join the dots by cycling from east to west, from Buenos Aires to Santiago. I plan to finish the expedition by visiting Rapa Nui, and completing the island's marathon in June, completing my journey and reconnecting the places that were introduced so many years ago.</p><p>In addition to retracing the original expedition my mission is to raise awareness of an urgent subject: contamination of the island’s freshwater aquifer. Partnering with <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Pacific.Aid.Australia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pacific Aid Australia </a>I’ll be working to raise funds to purchase and install infrastructure to help the island’s environment: a <a href=""http://www.biomax.com.au/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">BioMax</a> unit.</p><p>While the journey itself will enable me to connect with many people on the ground to fund raise, the delivery of the BioMax unit to Rapa Nui is only the beginning of the story. </p><p>As the expedition follows the path of Katherine Routledge &amp; the Mana, I plan to connect with as many different communities as I can, visit places the Mana Expedition explored and note changes as compared to the world in 1914 - especially the environment. I will use photography and film, and other media to record changes and document as many places and people as I travel. The long term plan is to create a body of work that will contribute to a exhibition - simple named 'Retracing Routledge', that will include works from a range of artists and travel between Darlington and Rapa Nui. </p><p>Katherine Routledge's book, <i>“The Mystery of Easter Island” </i>will act as the point of reference for the main questions of the expedition:</p><p>1. <i>How has the environment changed in the 100 years since the 1914 Mana Expedition?</i></p><p>2. <i>What are the main environmental issues facing the modern day Rapa Nui population?</i></p><p>The Mana Expedition set out to answer some of the big anthropological questions of the time – mainly, who were the Rapa Nui people and why did they create giant stone statues? The new goal is to ask environmentally focused questions related to this time, our time – and the hope to provide an insight to 21st century life as compared to that which the Mana team experienced in 1914. As Katherine and her team travelled they couldn’t just pop into an Internet café and send an email update to their loved ones. Instead it took weeks and months for bundles of letters to arrive by boat. </p><p><i>“Easter Island affords no good anchorage, and our plan was that the yacht, after disembarking the scientific members and waiting awhile off the coast, should return to Talcahuano… to collect letters and goods and then come out again to the island.”</i></p><p>Katherine Routledge, The Mystery of Easter Island.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/338785/files/20140130094955-Tongariki.jpg?1391104195"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p><b>The 2014 Route:</b></p><p>The <i>Running after Routledge</i> plan has been updated and will now take place over three main stages.</p><p><b>1. </b><b>February 2014. Darlington to Southampton, UK – <i>overland on foot</i>.</b></p><p>Starting from Hummersknott Academy in Darlington, my former school, I will run this section of the route as a form of personal tribute to the work of Katherine Routledge. To complete this stage I will have to run at least a marathon every day, which will be no easy task in the winter. But I'm looking forward to following the B-roads of England, winding through villages, towns &amp; the countryside towards Southampton. The run will end in Bursledon, on the Hamble River, close to where Katherine and William Scoresby Routledge lived whilst the Mana was being constructed. The full run route can be seen online by clicking <b><a href=""http://www.longrunergy.com/running/running-after-routledge/leg-1-uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">HERE</a></b>.</p><p><b>2.  April/ May 2014. </b><b>Buenos Aires to Santiago, Chile – <i>overland by bike</i>.</b></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">This is where it gets really challenging!

The team negotiated the 12,000 mile marine journey to Rapa Nui and once there completed a year of ground breaking anthropological field work that when published (The Mystery of Easter Island, Katherine Routledge) introduced the rest of the world to the enchanting Easter Island’s anthropological mysteries. The enigma of the islanders and their Moai statues continue to captivate scientists today.“Such is Easter Island… All portions of it are accessible; from every part is the wind of heaven; around and above all are boundless sea and sky, infinite space and a great silence. The dweller there is ever listening for he knows not what, feeling unconsciously that he is in the antechamber to something yet more vast which is just beyond his ken.”Katherine Routledge, The Mystery of Easter Island.I discovered Katherine’s extraordinary story when I travelled to Rapa Nui in 2005 to volunteer with a youth involvement programme: 'A Po. I was inspired by and fascinated that a lady from my home town, had the vision, drive and belief to undertake such an expedition to this place, half a world away studying culture so alien to her own.A century has now passed since the Mana Expedition struck out from England. In the eight years since I first visited Rapa Nui, I have seen how important such an intrepid journey was for both Darlington and Rapa Nui. Yet these remarkable connections will untie without remembrance and celebration.In 2014, a century after the historic expedition I will retrace the voyage of the Mana and in doing so celebrate the expedition’s achievements and trans-world ties whilst returning benefit to the people of Rapa Nui. But, without a custom built boat I have decided to do something else. The 2014 Expedition: ""Running after Routledge""Starting from Darlington on 14th February 2014, I will run from the north to the south of England, to Southampton - starting place of the Mana Expedition. Then I will visit a number of places and ports the Mana called into in South America, and will join the dots by cycling from east to west, from Buenos Aires to Santiago. I plan to finish the expedition by visiting Rapa Nui, and completing the island's marathon in June, completing my journey and reconnecting the places that were introduced so many years ago.In addition to retracing the original expedition my mission is to raise awareness of an urgent subject: contamination of the island’s freshwater aquifer. Partnering with Pacific Aid Australia I’ll be working to raise funds to purchase and install infrastructure to help the island’s environment: a BioMax unit.While the journey itself will enable me to connect with many people on the ground to fund raise, the delivery of the BioMax unit to Rapa Nui is only the beginning of the story. As the expedition follows the path of Katherine Routledge & the Mana, I plan to connect with as many different communities as I can, visit places the Mana Expedition explored and note changes as compared to the world in 1914 - especially the environment. I will use photography and film, and other media to record changes and document as many places and people as I travel. The long term plan is to create a body of work that will contribute to a exhibition - simple named 'Retracing Routledge', that will include works from a range of artists and travel between Darlington and Rapa Nui. Katherine Routledge's book, “The Mystery of Easter Island” will act as the point of reference for the main questions of the expedition:1. How has the environment changed in the 100 years since the 1914 Mana Expedition?2. What are the main environmental issues facing the modern day Rapa Nui population?The Mana Expedition set out to answer some of the big anthropological questions of the time – mainly, who were the Rapa Nui people and why did they create giant stone statues? The new goal is to ask environmentally focused questions related to this time, our time – and the hope to provide an insight to 21st century life as compared to that which the Mana team experienced in 1914. As Katherine and her team travelled they couldn’t just pop into an Internet café and send an email update to their loved ones. Instead it took weeks and months for bundles of letters to arrive by boat. “Easter Island affords no good anchorage, and our plan was that the yacht, after disembarking the scientific members and waiting awhile off the coast, should return to Talcahuano… to collect letters and goods and then come out again to the island.”Katherine Routledge, The Mystery of Easter Island.The 2014 Route:The Running after Routledge plan has been updated and will now take place over three main stages.1. February 2014. Darlington to Southampton, UK – overland on foot.Starting from Hummersknott Academy in Darlington, my former school, I will run this section of the route as a form of personal tribute to the work of Katherine Routledge. To complete this stage I will have to run at least a marathon every day, which will be no easy task in the winter. But I'm looking forward to following the B-roads of England, winding through villages, towns & the countryside towards Southampton. The run will end in Bursledon, on the Hamble River, close to where Katherine and William Scoresby Routledge lived whilst the Mana was being constructed. The full run route can be seen online by clicking HERE.2.  April/ May 2014. Buenos Aires to Santiago, Chile – overland by bike.This is where it gets really challenging! With 1500km/ 932miles to cover in roughly one month this section will be the most demanding. In order to reach Rapa Nui in time for the marathon on June 1st at least 30miles will have to be logged every day, in addition to research tasks and marathon training. This will require the utmost in preparation and planning. And then there is the small task of crossing those Andes!3. June 2014. Rapa Nui.The finale of the expedition on Rapa Nui will be in two parts. First, a free public presentation will be held to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the 1914 Mana Expedition - showing photos and film clips from along the route of the 'retracing' journey. This is also when an announcement will be made, with Pacific Aid Australia & BioMax, about the delivery of the sewage-digesting unit to the island. And finally... to end the fundraising challenge I will take part in the Rapa Nui Marathon on June 1st.Thank you! Thank you for reading about the new plans for Running after Routlegde!

pristine agricultural valley, the Avon Valley, is water catchment for critical
Western Australia water supplies. Now it is set to become a huge metropolitan
waste dump! At considerable cost we have proven that the proposed York landfill
site will pollute both the Mundaring catchment and the Swan River. For the next
40 plus years this tip will leak dangerous toxins such as mercury,
cyanide, lead,  arsenic and cadmium into the
Avon Valley’s ground water and into the State’s water supply. 
OUT OF
SIGHT IS NOT OUT OF MIND! 
Landfill sites on Perth’s coastal plain are now polluting Perth’s ground water
so the Government has handed the problem over to the private sector. The
multinational corporation SITA has proposed the Avon valley, as the next long
term landfill site for Perth. For our Politicians out of sight is out of mind and
the approval processes are moving unchecked through the bureaucracy. But York
Shire Council has voted unanimously to reject this proposal and the local
regional planning authority (JDAP ) has also rejected this prime farmland and
water catchment area as a site for  polluting landfill.

<p><b>Rabib:</b> I am a senior at the University of Mary Washington. I joined VSEC after attending the 2014 Virginia Power Shift, where I was inspired to see hundreds of active youth who were putting their beliefs into action. As a member of my university's divestment campaign, DivestUMW, I've seen the power of a grassroots movement in action and the empowering effects that it can have.

</div> <div> <h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Strategy</h3> <p></p>
<p><span>Dominion’s influence seems overwhelming, but in reality it only has the power granted to it by the people, politicians, and institutions in our state. We can build a social movement to build up our own power — the power of young people — and weaken Dominion’s by forcing students and the public at large out of passivity through escalating tactics around four critical pillars of support:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>News media</b> — <i>Demand accountability from major outlets who report on Dominion and state energy policy.</i></p></li>
<li><p><b>Public relations and advertising</b> — <i>Counter Dominion’s misinformation about its support for renewable energy and the environmental efficacy of natural gas.</i></p></li>
<li><p><b>Universities</b> — <i>Expose the ties of Dominion executives to Virginia universities and leverage our schools to remove the company’s social license.</i></p></li>
<li><p><b>Politicians</b> — <i>Make Dominion a toxic political ally in the lead-up to the 2015 elections by naming and shaming the politicians who accept the most campaign contributions from the company and have the worst environmental records. Register student voters to build a climate constituency that will serve as a powerful alternative to accepting support from Dominion.</i></p></li>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Where Your Money Is Going</h3> <p> </p>
<p><span>This strategy is moving forward whether we have the funds or not, but in order to really make a splash when school starts back up in the fall, we need organizers who can dedicate themselves fully to research, development of specific tactics and timelines, raising awareness, and planning for our big August retreat to launch the campaign with hundreds of students before the start of the academic year.</span></p>
<p>Here is our minimal budget for two Future Power Virginia Fellows to work over the summer in Richmond, VA with support from U.S. Climate Plan in Washington, DC:</p>

Queremos crear ciudades más sostenibles y habitables a través del uso de motocicletas eléctricas alimentadas con energía renovable y que además, gracias al uso de las baterías extraibles, nos permite realizar cambios rápidos sin tener que esperar durante las recargas. Nuestro objetivo es que empresas con grandes demandas de
movilidad en el entorno urbano (paquetería, reparto a domicilio,
etc.) cambien sus actuales vehículos de combustión por otros
eléctricos, más respetuosos con el medio ambiente y con las personas que viven en las ciudades.Nuestro servicio ofrece un renting de nueva generación. Ponemos a disposición del cliente todo lo que incluye un renting convencional (mantenimiento, seguros, etc.) y le entregamos una motocicleta eléctrica a coste cero. El usuario paga una cuota mensual por el uso de la motocicleta que además incluye toda la energía que precise a lo largo del mes. Seleccionamos y personalizamos motocicletas eléctricas para adaptarlas a las necesidades de nuestro cliente y le brindamos un servicio de recogida y entrega de baterías siempre cargadas con energía 100% renovable y sin esperas.

<p>We concerned about marine biodiversity conservation in Indonesia, and we commit to do so much thing for ocean sustainability. We did a project named Reef Covery, for monitoring fishes and reefs in some spot in Indonesia, like in Baluran marine park, and Peucang Island in Ujung Kulon marine park. We did this project since 2003. Not only that, we also do reef transplantation in those marine park.</p>

Unit Selam UGM is one of college student organization whose focus in  marine conservation in Gadjah Mada University, Indonesia.
We concerned about marine biodiversity conservation in Indonesia, and we commit to do so much thing for ocean sustainability. We did a project named Reef Covery, for monitoring fishes and reefs in some spot in Indonesia, like in Baluran marine park, and Peucang Island in Ujung Kulon marine park. We did this project since 2003. Not only that, we also do reef transplantation in those marine park.
                                  
                                  
                                  

Beside that thing, Unit Selam UGM also has other divisions, like underwater photography and videography, search and rescue, and the last athlete for fin swimming.
We consist of so much  youth member from so many background in university, like from fisheries major, social humanities major, engineering major, biological and science, and many others. So we hope this differences majors can help us to think and manage this campaign globally.
Actually this organization founded since 1987, and now is 27 anniversary of this organization.



Indonesia Archipelago
- Indonesia is one of the world largest archipelago in the world, who has 17,508 - 18,306 islands. and 8,844 that have been named according to estimates made by the Government of Indonesia, with 922 of those permanently inhabited.

- According to The New York Times scientist at works, Indonesia is located in coral triangle, that means we have the most marine biodiversity habitat, who has 590 species of reef-building coral and 4000 species of tropical fishes.

- Beside that amazing fact, as the world’s most diverse marine environment, the Coral Triangle supports the livelihoods of more than 340 million people.

- Indonesia as the largest coral reef area in Southeast Asia. Estimates of the extent of these coral reefs vary, but they likely total about 51,000 km². Indonesia’s coral reefs are among the most biologically rich in the world. 


- Depends on, STATE OF THE CORAL TRIANGLE: Indonesia book, surveys of coral reefs in Indonesia have improved slightly over the last decade. At the end of 2008, about 5% of the reefs were in excellent condition, 25% in good condition, 37% in moderate condition, and 32% in bad condition.


Banda Neira
- Banda Neira is one of few islands in the world that can proudly boast a beautiful landscape filled with rare and exotic wildlife, spectacular dive spots, coloured with exquisite corals and alive with all manner of sea creatures, and centuries of incredible history. A history both tremendous and tragic. A history of wealth and war. And the remnants remain to tell the story.




- Two of the biggest islands, Banda Besar and Naira, are covered with nutmeg trees. The third island, Gunung Api or ‘peak of fire’, is an active volcano that emerges from the deep in a perfect cone, and is entirely rugged and highly volcanic. In the waters surrounding these islands you’ll find some of the world’s most spectacular marine gardens, with bright corals and colorful fish, bustling through the crystal-clear waters, making it suitable for diving, snorkeling or even simply sightseeing.

The Plan
1. Openning ceremony in Yogyakarta, in December 2014
2. Reef and fishes monitoring with Line Intercept Transect method, in the end of January 2015
3. Reef Transplantation, in the end of January 2015

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p><strong>SantElm66 </strong>is both a site and an experience. The stunning new construction is near completion and will be open to anyone who is passionate about the environmental issues facing our world, regardless of technical knowledge or qualifications. Here participants will engage together and meet inspiring innovators and artists, as well as have time to relax and enjoy nature, healthy living, and local cuisine.  </p>
<p>Together we will look for answers to the questions: <strong>What choices and actions should we take to improve our living environment now and for the future? How can good and thoughtful design, art and architecture contribute to better living and a healthier planet? How can we best share our living spaces and benefit from exchanges with creators and each other? </strong></p>

<p>Conceived by Charles Poisay, environmentally committed architect, and Louise Brody, curator and designer, <strong>SantElm66</strong> began as a dream some years ago and that dream is now becoming a reality.</p>
<p>Multi-disciplinary sessions - group discussions, conferences, workshops, site visits, exhibitions and hands-on activities - as well as artists' residencies will provide the opportunty to collaborate and learn from one other. Join us for the space of a long weekend or a 6-day residence and benefit from these sessions that will empower you to build your own circles of influence.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558551631/xvpduqxojzxa7mcsweu7.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Together for a Better Future</h3>
<p><i><strong>The future is not what will happen, but what we are going to do.</strong> </i>Henri Bergson</p>
<p><strong>6-DAY RESIDENCES</strong> include encounters and discussions each morning, led by a specialist. Themes offered are:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>1. Architecture and landscaping:</strong> Environmental architecture and landscaping, and their implications in our lives.  </li>
<li>
<strong>2. Design: </strong>New modes of production and how we consume objects and everyday products.  </li>
<li>
<strong>3. New perspectives on artistic practices:</strong> Photographers, painters, and writers discuss how art influences our perceptions and can help us gain new perspectives.  </li>
</ul>
<p>During the 6-day sessions <strong>SantElm66</strong> can accommodate up to six people (three bedrooms), with half board included.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558551882/m5iemlcu0zmjqb1yvk6x.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>2-DAY MINI-RESIDENCES </strong>center around local resources and include at least one visit to a related site nearby. Themes offered are:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Organic produce and wine, regional markets and cooking  </li>
<li>2. Local artisanal and contemporary production (cork, ceramics, home construction and furnishings from recycled materials)</li>
</ul>
<p>During the 2-day sessions <strong>SantElm66</strong> can accommodate up to six people (three bedrooms), with half board included.</p>
<p><strong>Dinner-conferences</strong> with a specialist or noted expert will be organized for small groups.</p>
<p>Activities and workshops at <strong>SantElm66</strong> will be held during the months of June and July.<br/>Further details of the workshop programs and location can be found on the website <a href=""http://www.santelm66.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">santelm66</a>. Names of workshop leaders will be provided later. A wide range of lodgings is available in town.</p>
<p> Activities will be trilingual: English / Spanish / French as needed.</p>

<h3>The Location</h3>
<p><strong>SantElm66</strong> is named after the Sant Elm hermitage close by, which has one of the most breathtaking views of the Mediterranean coastline. <strong>SantElm66</strong> is at 66 meters altitude, between sea and forest. </p>
<p>The site is less than 5 minutes walking distance from the town center. An hour from <strong>Barcelona</strong> and 30 minutes from <strong>Girona</strong>, it is easily accessible by public transport. The region, known as “<strong>Emporda</strong>”, is particularly eco-sensitive, and produces some of Spain’s finest olive oils and wines. It boasts many forests and natural reserves with great hiking trails as well as organic farms and vineyards which workshop participants will be invited to visit.</p>
<p>Sant Feliu de Guixols is a historic town which grew from the settlement around a Benedictine monastery built in the  10th century. By the 18th century it had developed into an important trading center thanks to its fishing port, boat-building expertise and cork production. </p>
<p>Today Sant Feliu is a captivating town that functions all year round, and has preserved its authenticity - there are no fast-food chains or brand-name boutiques. Small shops and local commerce thrive. The daily market bursts with locally-grown and organic produce.</p>

<h3>What the funds will be used for</h3>
<p>The project is well underway and we are now seeking additional funds to complete the site for  <strong>SantElm66</strong>. </p>

<h3>Our Story &amp; Inspiration</h3>
<p>George Langworthy and Rob McFarland of <a href=""http://www.HoneyLove.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""http://www.HoneyLove.org/"">HoneyLove.org</a> are joining forces to save a Million Bees in the spring of 2013. And we're putting forward this fundraising campaign as a vital first step to our efforts.</p>
<p>We've both been out saving bees that would otherwise face extermination and relocating the hives at Bee Sanctuaries. But the time involved and cost of equipment has been holding us back from going out and rescuing as many hives as are out there in need of our help.</p>
<p><img alt=""ladderrescue"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i127.photobucket.com/albums/p159/hipfuel/DSCN3362.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></p>
<h3>Rescuing a Million Honeybees</h3>
<p>Our plan is to rescue 50 bee colonies in Southern California. With 20,000 bees per hive – this makes for a million bees! It’s a big job and your support is crucial. By helping with donations to this fundraising drive you are literally saving the lives of honeybees – and you can choose from a host of sweet rewards. Of course the biggest reward is knowing you have done something that will truly help bees and our environment.</p>
<p>The use of the funds raised is very simple. The money goes to purchase equipment, pay for gas, and afford the significant time it takes to rescue bee colonies and relocate them. Our funding drive allocates $350 for every hive that we save.</p>
<p>Many companies charge upwards of $500 to remove bees without killing the colony. And since homeowners and other friends of the bees often can’t afford this – we'll be coming in to help and save the bees. Our beekeeping practices are strictly organic, holistic, and in keeping with the natural order of the hive. And we’ll be ensuring a healthy life for the rescued colonies by placing them on Organic Farms, at Bee Sanctuaries, and in Organic Gardens. Your support is what makes it possible for us to get out there and save bees.</p>
<p>With our respective track records, you can rest assured that we'll find success in our efforts and can see a fun bee rescue in our campaign video.

<h3>Helping Bees Every Day</h3>
<p>It's easy to help bees in your every day life with simple actions that promote your own health as well as the health of our environment.</p>
<p>1 – Vote With Your Fork.</p>
<p>Buying organic produce helps nurture the food systems that take care of bees and the environment.</p>
<p>2 – Stop Home Pesticide Use.</p>
<p>Natural pest remedies are safer, more effective, and less expensive than toxic chemicals. Get rid of the pesticides in your cabinets, garages, and lawns.</p>
<p>3 – Plant A Garden.</p>
<p>Grow yummy food, delicious herbs, and beautiful flowers. It improves your health and helps the bees. Even people in apartments can grow food in planters or raise a window garden!</p>

</div></div>","Our Story & Inspiration
George Langworthy and Rob McFarland of HoneyLove.org are joining forces to save a Million Bees in the spring of 2013. And we're putting forward this fundraising campaign as a vital first step to our efforts.
We've both been out saving bees that would otherwise face extermination and relocating the hives at Bee Sanctuaries. But the time involved and cost of equipment has been holding us back from going out and rescuing as many hives as are out there in need of our help.

Rescuing a Million Honeybees
Our plan is to rescue 50 bee colonies in Southern California. With 20,000 bees per hive – this makes for a million bees! It’s a big job and your support is crucial. By helping with donations to this fundraising drive you are literally saving the lives of honeybees – and you can choose from a host of sweet rewards. Of course the biggest reward is knowing you have done something that will truly help bees and our environment.
The use of the funds raised is very simple. The money goes to purchase equipment, pay for gas, and afford the significant time it takes to rescue bee colonies and relocate them. Our funding drive allocates $350 for every hive that we save.
Many companies charge upwards of $500 to remove bees without killing the colony. And since homeowners and other friends of the bees often can’t afford this – we'll be coming in to help and save the bees. Our beekeeping practices are strictly organic, holistic, and in keeping with the natural order of the hive. And we’ll be ensuring a healthy life for the rescued colonies by placing them on Organic Farms, at Bee Sanctuaries, and in Organic Gardens. Your support is what makes it possible for us to get out there and save bees.
With our respective track records, you can rest assured that we'll find success in our efforts and can see a fun bee rescue in our campaign video. Visit the HoneyLove.org website to find out more about Rob's non-profit organization. Or go to www.vanishingbees.com to learn about George’s documentary on the health crisis facing bees today and what we can do about it.



Helping Bees Every Day
It's easy to help bees in your every day life with simple actions that promote your own health as well as the health of our environment.
1 – Vote With Your Fork.
Buying organic produce helps nurture the food systems that take care of bees and the environment.
2 – Stop Home Pesticide Use.
Natural pest remedies are safer, more effective, and less expensive than toxic chemicals. Get rid of the pesticides in your cabinets, garages, and lawns.
3 – Plant A Garden.
Grow yummy food, delicious herbs, and beautiful flowers. It improves your health and helps the bees. Even people in apartments can grow food in planters or raise a window garden!
4 – Raise Awareness.
The first step to activate change is education. Let people know about the bee crisis and what they can do to help.",6.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Whether by our own choice, gypsying about to new vistas, or by the will of the
planet itself, we see the world through this movement.  We lived in
Manitou Springs during the Waldo Canyon Fire, were in the process of moving to
Middlebury, Vermont during the floods of Hurricane Irene, and had just
finalized deals to move into a cabin in Pinewood Springs, Colorado this last
fall (the night before the floods that cut the town off from the outside
world).<br/><br/>
Needless to say, we're ready for a little stability in our lives, but our
relationship with Mother Nature is one of constant flux and change.  We
love her, but we live on her and respect her wishes when she says MOVE. 
So after a year of deliberation, we decided a mobile home of sorts was the
choice that resonated with us the most.</p>
<p>We weighed options ranging from yurts to airstream trailers,
but the burgeoning trend of tiny houses caught our attention after seeing a Tiny
House documentary at the Crested Butte Film Festival.<span>  Tiny homes reflected all the rustic appeal of
a cabin with the mobile flexibility of a trailer.  It would allow us to build something that had
significant cultural and ecological impact, while still allowing us freedom to
be creative and expressive in the building process.</span></p>

<p><b>The
Fun(d) in Fundraiser</b></p>
<p>To build this home as we intend, we
require materials.  Much of the philosophy behind this house is in regard
to consumption, sustainability, and thriftiness.  While we can idealize
that we could build an entire home from found and free scrap, we know that we
are going to have to at some point dole out some cash-money to get material.
 <br/><br/>
For example: to buy a new load bearing trailer for the home we are building,
most estimates range from a $3,500 to $4,000 investment.  Certainly, this is
the foundation of the structure itself (especially during transportation), but
still a bit on the pricey side.<span>  And
while a cheap (or free!) trailer would be wonderful, in all likelihood, it
would not be up to the weight potential of a home, so more money and time
go to parts and labor to make it load bearing.   <br/><br/>
Thus, in most of our estimates for cost, we took the middle route between
buying used for cheap and new for cost. We
think this is the safest and most logical way to lay out our expenses
beforehand.  </span></p>
<p>And labor?  Well that's all
us.  We are dedicated to building this from the ground up, minute by
minute, hour by hour.  This is the ultimate labor of love, building a
little baby abode we can call our own.</p>

<p></p></div>","A
Tiny IntroductionWe are (and always have been) a family in movement.  
Whether by our own choice, gypsying about to new vistas, or by the will of the
planet itself, we see the world through this movement.  We lived in
Manitou Springs during the Waldo Canyon Fire, were in the process of moving to
Middlebury, Vermont during the floods of Hurricane Irene, and had just
finalized deals to move into a cabin in Pinewood Springs, Colorado this last
fall (the night before the floods that cut the town off from the outside
world).
Needless to say, we're ready for a little stability in our lives, but our
relationship with Mother Nature is one of constant flux and change.  We
love her, but we live on her and respect her wishes when she says MOVE. 
So after a year of deliberation, we decided a mobile home of sorts was the
choice that resonated with us the most.
We weighed options ranging from yurts to airstream trailers,
but the burgeoning trend of tiny houses caught our attention after seeing a Tiny
House documentary at the Crested Butte Film Festival.  Tiny homes reflected all the rustic appeal of
a cabin with the mobile flexibility of a trailer.  It would allow us to build something that had
significant cultural and ecological impact, while still allowing us freedom to
be creative and expressive in the building process.
While we were initially at a loss as to how we could save
nearly $20,000 to build this tiny home, a growing awareness of the success of
many internet fundraising campaigns gave us an idea.  We could use the internet and local outreach
to bring to light the beauty of the tiny home, while simultaneously raising
money by offering incentives that reflect what responsible living means to us. This Indiegogo campaign, is the product of our
efforts.

Small
House, Big Impact
In a world of shrinking resources, our ingenuity doesn’t
have to shrink as well.  The tiny house
reflects an effort to focus more on responsible living and reciprocity with the
land.  
In the building process of the home, we plan on sourcing as
much of the material in the form of scrap as possible.  Much of the interior fixtures, plumbing,
cabinetry, wood paneling, and flooring is going to be repurposed from the wide
world of waste that surrounds the Denver Metro area.  Further, we plan on using pine beetle kill
wood for the paneling and siding to further lessen the environmental impact of
building a WOOD HOME.
The lack of a sewage line encourages the reclamation of more
traditional means of dealing with waste. 
Much of our waste water (grey water) will be put to use in our
garden.  And instead of allowing solid waste
to fester, promoting bacteria in clean drinking water, our composting toilet
will neutralize the acidity and create fertilizer especially conducive to the
growth of many of Colorado's native plant species.

many possibilities of over consumption in the first place.  While we already live quite frugal lives, we

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Brad Spanbauer and I am a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin - Oshkosh. I am studying tropical ecology and am working towards my M.S. in Biology. I am deeply passionate about conservation and sustainability. My thesis research is focused on savannah elephants as dispersers of key tree species in East Africa and their role in naturally contributing to tree recruitment. This area of research, particularly for this area of the tropics has not been studied extensively, and is extremely important in the global realm of ecosystem services provided by animals to help maintain the environment. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funds contributed to this project will go towards travel to and from where I stay in Tanzania to my field site, Tarangire National Park, a four hour drive. A day trip to the park on average costs $300 USD, and I will need to go several times to check my experiments in the field. This is one of the most expensive parts of my trip. If you contribute $20 or more you will receive a fantastic photograph from one of my previous trips to Tanzania for free! (Photographs will be viewable in an album labeled 'Contributor Photos') Let's see if we can exceed my goal!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is very important to me. I had always dreamed of going to Africa and now it is becoming a part of my career. What this project means for the planet is a better understanding of how animals interact with plants in their immediate environment and how their coexistence contrinbutes to a healthier planet for everyone. If the elephants are around to consume seeds, and replant them naturally, this gives a better conservation status for the elephants and the trees - swinging the natural order of the Earth back in balance.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you cannot help with a donation, one of the best things you can do is tell people. Share the link to my campaign and help spread the word to your friends. Thank you in advance.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>This fundraising campaign is to help raise money for year three of my long distance solo ride on horseback. This year's ride will take me from SW Alberta along the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains north towards the Yukon Territory. Money raised will go towards new equipment (camping and horse related) and supplies (mostly food) while on the journey which will last 5 months. My rides become the inspiration for my art work and also make clear that there is great importance in teling the story of my travels, of the people and of the possibilities of finding another way to exist on the earth.</p>
<p>Equipment to be purchased include: hoof boots, tent replacement, rainwear, cooking stuff, picket ropes, maps, cel phone coverage, emergency (spot) rescue device coverage &amp; some other items.</p>
<p>The amount that I am trying to raise is what I believe to be the minimum needed to get the ride going. Funds raised beyond my goal will be put towards a weatherproof video/still camera to help with better documentation and some equipment that though not essential would make life on the trail a little easier. Any donations beyond that will go towards suporting creating writing, music and other art work inspired by the ride that I will start in the autumn of 2013.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The spring of 2013 will find me travelling from south-west Alberta following the eastern edges of the Rocky Mountains north through Alberta, into BC following foothills, grasslands and mountains north towards the Yukon Territory.  I will be starting a little earlier this year and I expect this ride to last five months. May through September. </p>
<p>During the summers of 2011 and 2012, after much preparation over a number of years, I embarked on a solo long distance ride on horseback through southern Saskatchewan and Alberta on the plains of western Canada. Though my total distance was over 1700 km, the journey was about so much more than clocked distance. My goals were to find, bear witness and document remote and rare open native grass rangeland, to live as close to and simply with the land as I could; to experience this land and experience the kind of relationship with two beautiful horses that the slow mode of travel on horseback allows. These were an incredible, life changing journeys, taking me through weeks of stunning open native grass rangeland (the old growth forest of the prairies!) to seemingly endless, massive, heavily sprayed, mono crop fields. I lived through some wild weather. Massive tent flattening thunderstorms and plough winds, extreme heat, frosts early on in the ride and then again already in mid-August. I also witnessed the slow march of towering cloud formations, the calm stillness so common in the early evening, (such a welcome break from relentless prairie winds) or after a great thunderous storm had passed by, and dark sky preserves where there was no light pollution to mar the millions of stars twinkling above at me (us!) night.</p>
<p>I travelled, lived lightly, gathered much of my food from the land, greens mostly. Prior to the beginning of my journeys, I dry strips of meat in the sun. Some of that jerky i keep as is and some I mix with rendered fat and dried berries to make into nutrient packed pemmican. I also purchase food along the way in the occasional small town that I come across.</p>
<p>My relationship with my horses throughout the two summers, continued to build with each day and suddenly it became clear that we were a true team, a true herd of three. There was so much that came to that I was hoping would happen and of course much that was so very different than expected. The ride became settled in the moment, the necessary. Time changed. I can't say that it stood still exactly. Perhaps I could say that I became deeply aware of the way that time could be a flexible entity, shifting, changing, altering. Perceptions of vastness and the very intimate merge and pull apart. </p>
<p>I met many people living in this sparsely populated region. Generosity of spirit and openness was the norm and oftentimes I didn't even need to say why I was on this ride. They knew, they understood.</p>
<p>My name is Catherine Thompson. I am in my mid 50s, a Canadian writer, composer, musician, instrument maker, songwriter and artist. My work and life seeks to find a path back to our wild, natural selves; to find a way to leave behind the destructiveness of modern industrial civilisation; to increase awareness of our place on the land and the dire situation that we find ourselves in. Ecologically, socially, spiritually. </p>

<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, I cannot offer much in the way of perks for this fundraising effort as there is not much produced at this stage other than experience and inspiration.

<h3>The Great American Adaptation Road Trip</h3>
<p>As Americans, we pride ourselves on our resourcefulness and creativity in response to daunting societal problems. Climate change is one of our generation's most urgent challenges. Its effects are already being felt, from rising tides and more intense storms along our coasts to scorching droughts and water scarcity in our fields to melting glaciers on our tallest mountains. An unstable climate has and will create many problems, but it also creates opportunities—opportunities to develop new energy technologies, to produce less waste, to create new business models, to forge new partnerships, and to come together in our communities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are aiming to share stories about the way Americans are using technology to adapt to the felt impacts of climate change. We define technology as the tools and mechanisms through which people minimize the harmful consequences and exploit the opportunities posed by changes in climate. Technology can be a physical tool that functions on its own, such as permeable pavement or drought-resistance crops or coastal protection structures. But it can also be more of a social process, like training community members as environmental leaders or rethinking land use.</p>
<p>We plan to spend three months traveling the country to uncover stories about people and places adapting to climate change. We'll visit towns, small cities, rural areas, and national parks and meet with all sorts of people--city planners, natural resources managers, business owners, farmers, fisherman, foresters, insurance agents, and community leaders. Our storytelling will be multimedia, including short pieces of writing, photographs, video, and audio. By the end of the trip, we hope to have answered the question, <em>What does climate adaptation look like? </em>We imagine that it will look as diverse as the country we live in.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact </h3>
<p>Many towns and cities across the United States are already planning for a new climate reality, and some are sharing their efforts in the form of city plans or in the news. However, much of the innovation that's going on is not documented or not accessible. Our road trip aims to use stories to bridge the gap between existing research on climate change adaptation planning, and the often-overlooked, practical adaptive technologies already being used by people all over the country. Closing this gap has implications for technology transfers that could increase both national and international adaptive capacity in concert with global efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<h3>Funding</h3>
<p>We estimate that we will need about $12,000 to complete our three-month road trip, including gas, equipment, food, and lodging (we plan to camp or stay with friends for much of the trip). We have already raised about $8,000 through grants and support from the School of Natural Resources and Environment at the University of Michigan, where we just completed our master's degrees. We need about $4,000 more to make it all the way around the country collecting stories.</p>
<p>Support our trip and we'll send you a postcard (or 10!) from the road, a photograph of your choice—landscape or portrait—from our journey, or a GAART (Great American Adaptation Road Trip) T-shirt.</p>

<div>In December, the Alliance for Global Justice, an international solidarity organization, will be hosted by the <i>Forum Solidaridad Peru</i> (Peru Solidarity Forum) on a delegation where activists from around the world discuss real solutions to the ecological crisis.  At the last UN climate change summit in New York, governments made very slow head-way on this process of implementing a sustainable development agenda.  One example was the <a href=""http://www.commondreams.org/news/2014/10/03/flimsy-un-agreement-means-there-may-be-not-much-forest-left-save-2030"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">New York Declaration on Forests</a>, which is hardly a courageous step toward progress.  The <a href=""http://unfccc.int/meetings/lima_dec_2014/meeting/8141.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">next summit</a> will be held in Lima, Peru, and we won't be quiet there, either.  <br/>
</div>
<div>Aside from the rallies surrounding the UN gathering, we will be traveling north to the city of Cajamarca, and the villages surrounding it, to bear witness to the destructive impact of what is currently the world's most productive gold mine.  Many with claims to the land in the area have faced repression as a result of the mining company's rapacious appetite for more land, more water, and more stolen profits, barely investing a margin into local development.  The Conga Mine (Minas Conga) is a massive project owned mostly by Newmont, a corporation based in Denver, CO, and Buenaventura, based in Peru, and is partially financed by the International Monetary Fund.  </div>

<h3>Trees for Zambia Explained</h3>
<p>Based in South Africa, Greenpop is a social enterprise dedicated to urban greening, reforestation, and spreading eco-consciousness in Southern Africa. <b>Our aim is to inspire a fun an accessible green movement; the Treevolution.</b> <b>In July this year, we are kick-starting a reforestation and eco-education project in Zambia, the country with the second-highest deforestation in the world.</b> In the initial 3-week campaign, we will plant 5000 (or more!) trees in national parks, forest concessions, at schools, and on subsistence farms in and around Livingstone. Our aims are as follows: </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Start a reforestation process and encourage a tree-planting culture<br/>

<h3>Sustainability of the Project </h3>
<p>In order to make this project sustainable, it is essential to have the local community involved in and benefiting from our efforts. The main way of ensuring this is through education. We are working with education experts to develop the most suitable and fun educational material for both school children en subsistence farmers.

Based in South Africa, Greenpop is a social enterprise dedicated to urban greening, reforestation, and spreading eco-consciousness in Southern Africa. Our aim is to inspire a fun an accessible green movement; the Treevolution. In July this year, we are kick-starting a reforestation and eco-education project in Zambia, the country with the second-highest deforestation in the world. In the initial 3-week campaign, we will plant 5000 (or more!) trees in national parks, forest concessions, at schools, and on subsistence farms in and around Livingstone. Our aims are as follows: 


Start a reforestation process and encourage a tree-planting culture

Educate children on their natural environment and improve their food security by planting fruit trees at schools
Promote conservation farming methods in the local communities that will stop erosion and soil degradation, and create most cost-efficient farms at the same time
Start a micro-nursery enterprise with local subsistence farmers, which will provide them with an additional source of income (and they can use the trees as natural fertilizer on their land!)

you read about my campaign and you think it has a possibility of

and life style</u></b></p>
<p>I think Sir Richard Branson came closer to it than
anyone else when he said words to the effect that renewable energy would never
replace conventional fossil fuel generated energy, until it was able to offer
at least something that was as good as the energy security that the grid
offered OR better. Green Initiative offers the same energy security as the
grid, it offers the same plug and play environment that the grid does. This
means that if you decide it is too hot this summer and you need an
air-conditioner, all you have to do is buy it and plug it in. ‘Home Grid’ can
handle the load.<span>  ‘Home Grid’ offers the
way for an improved life style, it is a step away from exploitation and towards
nurturing. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Twenty first Century Technology :
Why not use it ? </b></p>
<p>Solar cells can theoretically run
for 9 hours a day continuously,  although the output will vary with the
amount of sun available, wind can run for even longer periods continuously,
ranging from hours to weeks. It is therefore only a matter of time before a
renewable energy source is found that can run 24 x 7, putting out a good
density of energy regardless of climate, weather, time of day, or location,
finally putting an end to the bane of intermittency.  This is what we at
GREEN INITIATIVE have accomplished and we did it by fusing some of the
fantastic technology and materials available in the twenty first century with
naturally occurring forces of nature. </p>
<p><b>Eureka Moment !</b></p>
<p>The eureka moment for Green
Initiative came when we realised that some of the first machines to be
successfully invented, built and used, such as the Newcomen Atmospheric engine,
were so simple and elementary in their design that they could be fitted with
modern technology so that they needed no external input !  Yes, everyone
says that it is impossible and that a device like that will contravene the
second law of the conservation of energy.  Read on and decide for
yourselves. How the ‘Home Grid’ system works: We have a thoroughly proven proof
of concept model, we need to build a working model.  Look at this link <a href=""http://www.vacuumelevators.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://www.vacuumelevators.com/</span></a>
it says a lot about the materials used and the working of our system. The only
real difference is that we use the kinetic energy of a descending counterweight
to create a vacuum, this vacuum is then shared by two to three systems to
operate cyclically and generate useful electrical output. We at GREEN
INITIATIVE believe that we have the most practical and workable sustainable
renewable energy solution found to date. It produces an amazing 10 KW (or more
if needed) output of electricity 24 x7. This works out to 240 KWh a day.
 This is the renewable energy solution that everybody has been waiting
for, it is not intermittent in fact it offers the same kind of energy security
that the grid does.  The working of the system is very similar to
the working of the Newcomen Atmospheric Engine. </p>
<p><b> The Newcomen engines</b> were formidable, the largest ones  were used to pump upto  7 million gallons of water from the river Thames each day to supply drinking
water to London. These engines could lift a counterweight weighing 35 tons
using just atmospheric pressure and a vacuum. See animation: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcomen_atmospheric_engine"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcomen_atmospheric_engine</span></a>
. The system that we have designed works in exactly a similar manner except
that a pulley and cable is used to connect the counterweight and the piston.
RIGHT ! you say, that won’t work !  But I think it will. The first steam
engines produced by Thomas Savery used wooden barrels for the cylinder, and the
first models of the Newcomen engine used crudely cast cylinders that were ovoid
at best in shape, yet the engine worked!  The pistons were ‘sealed' by
wrapping them with oil or grease soaked rags! </p>
<p><b>Twenty-first Century Technology:</b></p>
<p>Look at the fantastic technology
that we have developed since then for instance PTFE a form of teflon has a
co-efficient of friction that at 0.05 that is almost as low as ice sliding on
ice! Teflon is extremely hard wearing and can  be used as a coating. Again
the jet engines on a Boeing can suck in and expel 1000 cubic metres of air in
one second, the ‘Home Grid’ system has to expel only about 2 cubic metres of
air in one second. There are many vacuum pumps that can do this, one such pump
uses just 2.2 KW,  has a pumping capacity of 600 cubic metres/hour and can
produce a vacuum of 10^^-3 Torr, which is about ten thousand times greater than
the vacuum that is needed for the ‘Home Grid’ system. So yes, I think it can be
done, and done quite easily.  Further I am thinking of using multi-stage
turbines, since they will do the job and will run for ever with little or no
maintenance.  To complete the Newcomen engine story, of course when James
Watt demonstrated that super heated steam could produce pressures of several
hundreds of atmospheres, interest in the Newcomen engine disappeared almost
instantly, the new engines, were more compact and many magnitudes of times more
powerful. </p>
<p><b>Check out the physical linkage and
see if you can find a fault: </b></p>
<p>The beauty of this ‘Home Grid’
system is that it is based on hard physical facts that can be checked out
theoretically, it is not for instance like the over-unity  Bidini engine
which claims to produce more energy than is used to run it or the numerous
perpetual motion machines that can be found on the net.  By contrast,
everything about the ‘Home Grid’ system can easily be verified: </p>
<ol>
<li> Kinetic Energy of descending counterweight </li>
<li> Energy needed to turn generator </li>
<li> Energy needed to produce vacuum </li>
<li> energy needed to raise counterweight back to
     original position. </li>
</ol><p>As can be seen it is a chain of
physical events that can be easily verified. If that chain of events is broken
at any point then you know that the system will not work, which is not the case
here.  Here is a chain of events of proven physical phenomena that take
place when the system is working: </p>
<ol>
<li>  Taking a counterweight that weighs
     approximately  150 Kg situated at a height of 10m, its kinetic energy
     will be 150 Kg x 10m x  9.8m/sec^^2 = 14.7 KJ. </li>
<li>  Energy needed to run generator = 5 KW, energy
     available from descending counterweight = 14 KW approx.  <a href=""http://www.aurasystems.com/pages/prod_exploded.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://www.aurasystems.com/pages/prod_exploded.html</span></a> 
      (P.S  the descending counterweight turns a  pulley just as
     in the case of a car alternator.)  In case you have not noticed
     enough energy and to spare is available for turning of the generator! </li>
<li>  The multi stage vacuum turbine needs 3KW ,
     power available  =  5KW.</li>
<li>  Lastly the open ended shuttles are sealed
     converting them into pistons and atmospheric pressure acting on them is
     enough to raise the counterweight to its original position. For instance
     if diameter of shuttle/piston is 30 cms, then its surface area is 706 cms
     and pressure available if a vacuum of 100 torrs is created beneath the
     sealed shuttle/piston is equal to 565 Kgs approx, more than enough energy
     to lift the counterweight back to its original height. </li>
<li> The shuttle is then unsealed and gravity pulls the
     counterweight down resulting in a continuous cycle with the counterweights
     going up and down creating 10 KW ( more if needed) electrical output. </li>
</ol><p>If it can be proved that this
causative chain of physical events is possible it means that there is a 90%
chance that the system will work, if on the other hand a fault is found
somewhere in this chain of physical events, then there is a high probability
that the system won’t work. Please donate money to build a working model, we
need about $100,000.  More updates to follow.     </p>

renewable energy source is found that can run 24 x 7, putting out a good
density of energy regardless of climate, weather, time of day, or location,
finally putting an end to the bane of intermittency.  This is what we at
GREEN INITIATIVE have accomplished and we did it by fusing some of the
fantastic technology and materials available in the twenty first century with
naturally occurring forces of nature. 
Eureka Moment !
The eureka moment for Green
Initiative came when we realised that some of the first machines to be
successfully invented, built and used, such as the Newcomen Atmospheric engine,
were so simple and elementary in their design that they could be fitted with
modern technology so that they needed no external input !  Yes, everyone
says that it is impossible and that a device like that will contravene the
second law of the conservation of energy.  Read on and decide for
yourselves. How the ‘Home Grid’ system works: We have a thoroughly proven proof
of concept model, we need to build a working model.  Look at this link http://www.vacuumelevators.com/
it says a lot about the materials used and the working of our system. The only
real difference is that we use the kinetic energy of a descending counterweight
to create a vacuum, this vacuum is then shared by two to three systems to
operate cyclically and generate useful electrical output. We at GREEN
INITIATIVE believe that we have the most practical and workable sustainable
renewable energy solution found to date. It produces an amazing 10 KW (or more
if needed) output of electricity 24 x7. This works out to 240 KWh a day.
 This is the renewable energy solution that everybody has been waiting
for, it is not intermittent in fact it offers the same kind of energy security
that the grid does.  The working of the system is very similar to
the working of the Newcomen Atmospheric Engine. 
 The Newcomen engines were formidable, the largest ones  were used to pump upto  7 million gallons of water from the river Thames each day to supply drinking
water to London. These engines could lift a counterweight weighing 35 tons
using just atmospheric pressure and a vacuum. See animation: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcomen_atmospheric_engine
. The system that we have designed works in exactly a similar manner except
that a pulley and cable is used to connect the counterweight and the piston.
RIGHT ! you say, that won’t work !  But I think it will. The first steam
engines produced by Thomas Savery used wooden barrels for the cylinder, and the
first models of the Newcomen engine used crudely cast cylinders that were ovoid
at best in shape, yet the engine worked!  The pistons were ‘sealed' by
wrapping them with oil or grease soaked rags! 
Twenty-first Century Technology:
Look at the fantastic technology
that we have developed since then for instance PTFE a form of teflon has a
co-efficient of friction that at 0.05 that is almost as low as ice sliding on
ice! Teflon is extremely hard wearing and can  be used as a coating. Again
the jet engines on a Boeing can suck in and expel 1000 cubic metres of air in
one second, the ‘Home Grid’ system has to expel only about 2 cubic metres of
air in one second. There are many vacuum pumps that can do this, one such pump
uses just 2.2 KW,  has a pumping capacity of 600 cubic metres/hour and can
produce a vacuum of 10^^-3 Torr, which is about ten thousand times greater than
the vacuum that is needed for the ‘Home Grid’ system. So yes, I think it can be
done, and done quite easily.  Further I am thinking of using multi-stage
turbines, since they will do the job and will run for ever with little or no
maintenance.  To complete the Newcomen engine story, of course when James
Watt demonstrated that super heated steam could produce pressures of several
hundreds of atmospheres, interest in the Newcomen engine disappeared almost
instantly, the new engines, were more compact and many magnitudes of times more
powerful. 
Check out the physical linkage and
see if you can find a fault: 
The beauty of this ‘Home Grid’
system is that it is based on hard physical facts that can be checked out
theoretically, it is not for instance like the over-unity  Bidini engine
which claims to produce more energy than is used to run it or the numerous
perpetual motion machines that can be found on the net.  By contrast,
everything about the ‘Home Grid’ system can easily be verified: 

 Kinetic Energy of descending counterweight 
 Energy needed to turn generator 
 Energy needed to produce vacuum 
 energy needed to raise counterweight back to
     original position. 
As can be seen it is a chain of
physical events that can be easily verified. If that chain of events is broken
at any point then you know that the system will not work, which is not the case
here.  Here is a chain of events of proven physical phenomena that take
place when the system is working: 

  Taking a counterweight that weighs
     approximately  150 Kg situated at a height of 10m, its kinetic energy
     will be 150 Kg x 10m x  9.8m/sec^^2 = 14.7 KJ. 
  Energy needed to run generator = 5 KW, energy
     available from descending counterweight = 14 KW approx.  http://www.aurasystems.com/pages/prod_exploded.html 
      (P.S  the descending counterweight turns a  pulley just as
     in the case of a car alternator.)  In case you have not noticed
     enough energy and to spare is available for turning of the generator! 
  The multi stage vacuum turbine needs 3KW ,
     power available  =  5KW.
  Lastly the open ended shuttles are sealed
     converting them into pistons and atmospheric pressure acting on them is
     enough to raise the counterweight to its original position. For instance
     if diameter of shuttle/piston is 30 cms, then its surface area is 706 cms
     and pressure available if a vacuum of 100 torrs is created beneath the
     sealed shuttle/piston is equal to 565 Kgs approx, more than enough energy
     to lift the counterweight back to its original height. 
 The shuttle is then unsealed and gravity pulls the
     counterweight down resulting in a continuous cycle with the counterweights
     going up and down creating 10 KW ( more if needed) electrical output. 
If it can be proved that this
causative chain of physical events is possible it means that there is a 90%
chance that the system will work, if on the other hand a fault is found
somewhere in this chain of physical events, then there is a high probability
that the system won’t work. Please donate money to build a working model, we
need about $100,000.  More updates to follow.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Program</h3>
<p>ISV is a U.S. based non-profit organization. ISV deals with volunteer projects in the countries of Australia, Costa Rica, South Africa, Thailand, Dominican Republic, New Zealand, and Ecuador. Volunteer projects deal mainly with community development and wildlife conservation.</p>
<p>For myself, after carefully looking at program for each country, I have decided that South Africa speaks to me. I've always loved animals. Ever since I could remember, I've always had some sort of pet, whether it be kittens, chickens, rabbits or fish! For me, this is a chance of a lifetime! Lions just so happen to be my all time favorite animals, and to be able to be in the same country that they are native to, just makes my heart race.</p>
<p>In South Africa, more land is protected through private reserves than as part of National Parks. ISV works with a number of local organizations on selected environmental management / scientific research programs.  As a volunteer you will help professional researchers to collect important data on specific flora and fauna. In reality what this means is that you will receive specialized training in data collection, why it is critical to conservation management, and in the process you will learn an incredible amount about African wildlife, conservation and scientific research. </p>
<p>Non-profit, non-governmental wildlife rescue and rehabilitation centers require a lot of help to run and maintain. Buildings and fences need repairs, trees need planting, weeds need removing, grass needs slashing, animals need feeding, and enclosures need painting and “enriching” to minimize stress in animals. Eventually, those that can be rehabilitated need to be returned to the wild. For this reason, direct interaction with animals is avoided or minimized as the desire is to help them stay ‘wild’. Part of the greater goals for these centers is to educate farmers, tourists, school children and others. This too takes time, money and passionate and dedicated individuals.</p>
<p>Volunteers are part of the heart and soul of wildlife rehabilitation centers. Not only that, this is an incredible opportunity for you to learn about wildlife issues from inspirational conservationists, be part of the daily activities of a wildlife rehabilitation center and of course, see incredible African animals up close. Hear cheetahs purring at close quarters, chat to the resident meerkat family, listen to the unusual sounds of the African wild dog and learn more about the challenges that these incredible animals face in wild. While it is not located in the wilds it is a great opportunity to learn more about what it takes to help threatened species come back from the brink of extinction.</p>
<p>It is immensely rewarding to know that as a volunteer, your activities have helped critically endangered and threatened animals live out their lives in comfort or be ready to be released back into their natural environment.</p>
<p>Days normally start at 8am and finish around 5pm.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>ISV volunteers have contributed over 3,500 person hours towards assisting with animal care at the rehabilitation centers. This includes involvement in daily cleaning rounds (cleaning feeding trays, enclosures etc.), feeding rounds (feeding animals like African Wild Dogs, cheetahs, vultures, brown hyenas and more), ambassador care (helping with cheetahs that are used to educate children and adults alike to the plight of the cheetahs and other threatened species) and cheetah runs (exercising cheetahs). Without a large number of person hours dedicated solely to the care and maintenance of these animals they would be unable to survive.</p>
<p>Wild cheetahs are rescued from farms where they threaten the livelihood of many farmers and thus endanger their own lives. Cheetahs require comfortable and safe enclosures to spend time from being rescued to being re-released into the wild. The same is also true for the permanent residents of wildlife rescue centers. ISV volunteers have worked hard, spending over 15,000 person hours working on enclosure maintenance. This work involves manual tasks including rust removal, painting, alien vegetation removal, and cutting back vegetation. This is probably one of the single most important contributions ISV has made to wildlife care and rehabilitation centers.</p>

<p>There's a catch, though.  Those who would like to earn their LEED Green Associate designation need to pass a two hour examination.  It will require a ton of studying for me to pass the exam and the study materials and course that I will use to prepare are pretty expensive.  The course and study materials combine for $200 and it costs another $200 to take the exam.  I would really appreciate your help to get me to $400 so that I can take the course, study the material and sit for the exam.</p>

<p><b>Help Us Get to London for the Conference</b></p>
<p>Hello! We are Jon and Catrina Huynh-Weiss, high school sweethearts who like to dream big.  In 2011, after a master’s degree program on global politics and climate change at The London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), Jon started Lake Climate Group (Lake) -- a climate finance and policy organization aiming simultaneously to address the global climate change and inequality crisis by creating incentivized socio-economic opportunities between developed and developing countries.  Phew!  Jon’s professional background is in-and-around the US Federal government (Congress and Treasury Dept.) and higher education as Director of Strategic Initiatives for Government, Community and Public Affairs for Johns Hopkins Institutions (JHU/JHM). Alongside, Catrina's experience as a television producer <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">for PBS, C-SPAN, Travel Channel and Discovery </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">and as a community development practitioner, she works with Jon to help advance Lake’s mission. </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Our shared dreams for enabling needed and radical change to create a thriving Earth embodies Lake -- an emergent Minneapolis based organization named after our son, Sander Lake.  Lake's model promotes demand driven opportunities to help jointly address the global climate and inequality crisis.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>
<p></p>
<p>On Monday, September 30th the abstract Jon submitted to Tyndall Center for Climate Change Research and the Royal Society's <a href=""http://www.tyndall.ac.uk/radical-emission-reduction-conference"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">UK Radical Emission Reduction Conference</a> was accepted for a presentation!  The Royal Society (The National Academy of Science in the UK) is a prestigious 351 year-young scientific organization. We are grateful to be selected to present at this two-day conference from December 10-11, 2013!</p>
<p>Why is funding difficult for our family of three to travel to London? And why are we all going? Our Lake Climate Group, which includes colleagues from around the world, has been focused on establishing itself and therefore has <i>not</i> generated revenue. We work together as a team, bringing different skills, and want to seize this amazing collaborative opportunity with experts from around the world to build increased momentum and garner  exposure and support to make this model a reality. Importantly, we also want our son to experience this unmatched learning opportunity. As passionate climate entrepreneurs we know “doing your dreams” requires having fun, along with very hard work!  <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">And, while we’re optimistic about recent great successes your support of our ability to attend this conference will help us build upon progress. This is an enormous opportunity to advance our locally replicable and globally scalable climate finance model</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Your financial support will also facilitate our connecting and collaborating with other conference participants -- academics, practitioners, engineers, economists, policy-makers, and civil society experts -- all aiming to share evidenced-based opportunities for delivering urgent and deep reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases. Ultimately, you’ll also be helping us model to our son what perseverance, collaboration and hope can achieve. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Do your dreams!</span></p>
<p><b>What We Need ... And Some Perks For You Too!</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Our funding campaign request is $3000 (fingers crossed). To travel from Minneapolis to London we will need to purchase airfare for three people and pay for the conference registration for Catrina and Jon. We hope to arrange free lodging with dear friends and take public transportation wherever we go, thanks to the amazing London Tube (Mind the Gap!) and accessible bus routes.</p>
<p>It will cost nearly $2000 to fly to London for the three of us and almost $1000 to register for the conference.  Jon’s mother worked for the airlines and thankfully we can access stand-by airfare prices at discounted rates as a way to reduce airfare costs from $3500 to $1667 for the three of us. Jon says, “Thanks, Mom!” </p>
<p>The two-day conference registration costs £300, which is approximately $480 x 2, totaling $960. The remainder will go to pay for public transportation costs and food. Our conservative estimates are that we’ll need to spend $30/person/day for food and transportation for 4 days, totaling $360.  </p>
<p>Your contribution matters to us because we want to make this a reality for our family, and hopefully the planet.</p>
<p>Donations can be made through Pay Pal (even without a Pay Pal account set-up) or by credit card. </p>
<p>If we don’t reach our entire goal of $3000 (gulp), we will explore alternative ways to raise the money needed for this opportunity in London.  </p>
<p>Now, if you choose to donate, you won't leave empty-handed!  We’ve designed five special perk packages just for our supporters, and if you support us at or above the levels we've arranged, you'll receive unique perks from us truly!</p>
<p>If you contribute <b>$10 </b>you will receive Our Eternal Gratitude.  This is a highly coveted prize: Gratitude goes a long ways and it will never die.  It will never fade nor will not wear out.  And it's only $10.  Good kharma makes the perfect gift for any occasion!</p>
<p>If you contribute <b>$25 </b>you'll receive a Postcard from England (though mailed from the US to reduce our carbon footprint!).  We'll ship it right to your door, with a personal note from us.  <i>Our</i> <i>Eternal Gratitude included.</i></p>
<p>If you contribute <b>$50</b>, you'll get a personalized Video Thank-You from us.  We’ll record it on our iPhone (maybe from London) and send it to you via email.  You'll be able to see the tears of gratitude in our eyes for yourself.  And we mean that seriously.  You're the best.  <i>Also includes Postcard from England (carbon-consciously mailed from the US) and Our Eternal Gratitude.</i></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>If you contribute <b>$100</b>, Sander says he’ll be happy to send you a London-inspired artwork made and signed by him.  Hey, I'd donate $100 just for that!  <i>You'll also get a Video Thank-You, a Postcard from England (carbon a-hem...), and Our Eternal Gratitude. </i></p>

<p>The ""Talk Radio Industry"" has been almost completely dominated by those angry loud voices who adamantly deny climate change, ranging from attacking the science itself, the scientists, the scientific consensus, and my favorite; the ""global hoax"" theory.  These talk radio hosts read from the same script written by ""Think Tanks"" funded by Big Oil which launched a massive Media and PR campaign to ""confuse the American public"" on the science two decades ago. They succeeded and ""talk radio"" played a key role in their success (see the smoking gun memos in the Extra's section).</p>

<p>Here's the problem: until the American Public understands
how high the stakes are, how small the window is, and that the solutions are
""here and now"" too, we are headed toward a future that is not fit for
survival as we know it. It's late, <i>but it's not too late. More extremes are on the way but we can avoid  the nightmare scenerio!</i></p>

<p>On September 21st, the People's Climate March organized the largest
climate march in history with 400,000 people in Manhattan and 2600 events
held globally. The people marched and so did the UN General Secretary, Al Gore,
CEO's like Ikea's CEO <span>Peter
Agnefjäll  and their CSO (Chief Sustainability Officer), Steve
Howard, and Patagonia's CEO Rose Marcario, celebrities like Leonardo
DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo. As the bus captain from Detroit, I was one
small part of that. Something felt different, something changed - a tipping
point was near. We all pledged to do our part to breach that tipping point, like the Berlin (or Climate) Wall. As a veteran talk radio host who has spent 21 years
working on climate change, I now know my part to help breach the wall.  So here we go. We're
launching Climate Talk Radio!</span></p>

<h2><b>So What is Climate Talk Radio? </b></h2>
<p></p>
<p>A radio talk show hosted by veteran radio host Nancy Skinner with live callers from 4-6 PM Eastern daily which features those on the leading edge of the climate movement from all sectors: top climate scientists, entrepreneurs, market innovators and leading companies, and we will take live callers from across the country.</p>
<ul><li>As a long-time radio and TV personality, my style is, uh, a little different. It's smart, witty, compassionate, tough (climate deniers go down in the first round) and very human (this is a bloody serious time in history - so we will cry when disasters strike, laugh when stupidity strikes, and ultimately triumph together). It's compelling mainstream talk radio for listeners who we need to be engaged, asking their leaders to lead (how novel) on the issue - which quite frankly is, well, necessary for our survival. </li></ul>

This after rebuilding flooded communities as models of sustainability, helping launch the Chicago Climate Exchange, and using her Business Degree from the Univeristy of Michigan, she determined that public opinion was the frontline of this ""war on the science"". She was a host for 8 years on WLS Radio in Chicago, a nationally syndicated co-host on 465 stations, and her own show on 81 stations. She was a regular substitute on stations like Boston's WRKO, New York's WOR and Chicago's WGN, where her ""Climate Change Believer"" status was a rare minority. Nancy just became a Member of Climate Reality's Leadership Corps, trained by Al Gore in Rio November. </span></h3>

<p><b>Climate Talk Radio (CTR) is not your typical NPR “preach
to the choir” show. The choir was in the streets of Manhattan. They get it -
we've got about ten years to get this right, and we can do it! Renewable energy
costs have plummeted, crazy technology breakthroughs are happening every day. <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/05/business/energy-environment/large-companies-prepared-to-pay-price-on-carbon.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Major companies are taking the lead </a>down the carbon-neutral
path and CEO's of some of the largest companies were marching right alongside us in
Manhattan. People are beginning to connect the dots on freakishly extreme
weather, and we will make it even more clear (something the mainstream media has flunked on frankly). When 400,000 people from all 50 states take to the streets with, 2600 global events, and the national media coverage <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/22/peoples-climate-march-media-coverage_n_5860502.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">was a collective shrug</a>, then we need to keep the megaphone turned on!</b></p>
<p>The multi-media show (Streaming Net, the Mobile and
Tablet Apps, and streaming HD Video, then more terrestrial radio stations
and satellite radio as we grow) will be live and cover real ""Breaking
News"" and a myriad of topics with top name guests: top scientists,
entrepreneurs, CEO's and CSO's (Chief Sustainability Officer's) of companies
reducing their carbon footprint, student leaders, and organizations on the front
lines. CTR will be going to places all over the globe to really see the
wreckage climate change is already causing and the human toll, noting which nations
are kicking butts and taking names on renewable energy and where the ""smart
money"" is going on Wall Street (hint it's not into coal plants). </p>
<h3>BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS YOU - THE LIVE CALLERS FROM ALL 50 STATES!</h3>
<p>The key ingrediant is that CTR will take live callers. You need to speak your peace, ask questions, deniers will have their shot (but good luck with that) and although I like podcasts (and will have them), ultimately, it will take interaction with ordinary Americans to truly bring them up to speed on the science, the urgency, and make Climate Talk Radio rise above the noise the deniers have been putting out for 20 years!</p>

California is in a 500-yr. drought, Michigan broke all snowfall records last winter and has had sustained extreme downpours and flooding this summer.  Hurricanes and tropical storms on both coasts and massive storm systems putting 40 million people in its path this summer.

<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Media has a major impact on public opinion (which affects policymakers) and national media has continued to focus on political food fights, celebrity nonsense, and crisises like Ebola and ISIS, which are real,  but will affect far fewer people than the hundreds of millions that will be affected and displaced by sea level rise, weather extremes, and the extraordinary costs to our nation's economy. They continue to act like the ""jury is out"" or there are two sides that carry equal weight and stage ""faux debates"", when that nonsense should have ended many many years ago. It's time our voices are heard so Americans can choose to continue down a ""business as usual"" path (which pretty much means game over), or choose to embrace the innovation, ingenuity and fortitude of the American spirit and ""bend history"". </span><br/>

FROM OUR FLAGSHIP STATION WPWC 1480 AM IN WASHINGTON DC 



(where this Congress needs to hear it!)
4-6 PM Eastern DAILY!
TO THE WORLD ONLINE (AND IF THIS CAMPAIGN DOES REALLY WELL, ON  XM SIRIUS RADIO) FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICANS TO HEAR!



The ""Talk Radio Industry"" has been almost completely dominated by those angry loud voices who adamantly deny climate change, ranging from attacking the science itself, the scientists, the scientific consensus, and my favorite; the ""global hoax"" theory.  These talk radio hosts read from the same script written by ""Think Tanks"" funded by Big Oil which launched a massive Media and PR campaign to ""confuse the American public"" on the science two decades ago. They succeeded and ""talk radio"" played a key role in their success (see the smoking gun memos in the Extra's section).


BUT 20 YEARS LATER TIME IS RUNNING OUT!

Now
the Pentagon, the White House, the US National Academy of Sciences, NASA, NOAA,
and hundreds of professional organizations like the American Medical
Association (AMA), the American Meteorological Society (AMS) are calling for ""urgent action"" because...

AND WE REALLY NEED THESE GUYS ON RADIO - THE REAL SCIENTISTS, ENTREPRENEURS,COMPANIES AND ACTIVISTS THAT ARE TELLING THE TRUTH AND SOLVING THE CRISIS!

Michael Mann, PhD                                 Jason Box, PhD              Bill McKibben 



Peter Sinclair                   Richard Sandor                 Joe Romm



Climate Change is ""Here and Now"".



Here's the problem: until the American Public understands
how high the stakes are, how small the window is, and that the solutions are
""here and now"" too, we are headed toward a future that is not fit for
survival as we know it. It's late, but it's not too late. More extremes are on the way but we can avoid  the nightmare scenerio!


With the 53 million Americans who
listen to talk radio, we need to get the truth out and the solutions
started. 


On September 21st, the People's Climate March organized the largest
climate march in history with 400,000 people in Manhattan and 2600 events
held globally. The people marched and so did the UN General Secretary, Al Gore,
CEO's like Ikea's CEO Peter
Agnefjäll  and their CSO (Chief Sustainability Officer), Steve
Howard, and Patagonia's CEO Rose Marcario, celebrities like Leonardo
DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo. As the bus captain from Detroit, I was one
small part of that. Something felt different, something changed - a tipping
point was near. We all pledged to do our part to breach that tipping point, like the Berlin (or Climate) Wall. As a veteran talk radio host who has spent 21 years
working on climate change, I now know my part to help breach the wall.  So here we go. We're
launching Climate Talk Radio!




So What is Climate Talk Radio? 

A radio talk show hosted by veteran radio host Nancy Skinner with live callers from 4-6 PM Eastern daily which features those on the leading edge of the climate movement from all sectors: top climate scientists, entrepreneurs, market innovators and leading companies, and we will take live callers from across the country.
As a long-time radio and TV personality, my style is, uh, a little different. It's smart, witty, compassionate, tough (climate deniers go down in the first round) and very human (this is a bloody serious time in history - so we will cry when disasters strike, laugh when stupidity strikes, and ultimately triumph together). It's compelling mainstream talk radio for listeners who we need to be engaged, asking their leaders to lead (how novel) on the issue - which quite frankly is, well, necessary for our survival. 

ABOUT THE HOST - NANCY SKINNER
Nancy Skinner decided to get into talk radio and set the truth straight on global warming way back in 1997. This after rebuilding flooded communities as models of sustainability, helping launch the Chicago Climate Exchange, and using her Business Degree from the Univeristy of Michigan, she determined that public opinion was the frontline of this ""war on the science"". She was a host for 8 years on WLS Radio in Chicago, a nationally syndicated co-host on 465 stations, and her own show on 81 stations. She was a regular substitute on stations like Boston's WRKO, New York's WOR and Chicago's WGN, where her ""Climate Change Believer"" status was a rare minority. Nancy just became a Member of Climate Reality's Leadership Corps, trained by Al Gore in Rio November. 




Featuring the Best Production and Contributors on Climate Change in the World!
Peter Sinclair 



Joining me in the production is veteran Videographer and Climate Denier De-bunker, Peter Sinclair, who runs the website www.climatecrocks.com and is the Media Director on the International Dark Snow project, where he just returned from his second expedition to the Greenland Ice Sheets. 


The show already has contributors signed up from the world's leading scientists (and we will let them talk without cutting them off after 4 seconds). 
SHOW CONTRIBUTORS - FROM REAL CLIMATE SCIENTISTS, TO TECHNOLOGY AND MARKET GURUS TO CELEBRITIES AND POLITICIANS
Michael E. Mann, PhD
Distinguished Professor of Meteorology and Director of Earth Systems Science Center at Penn State University. Dr. Michael E. Mann received his undergraduate degrees in Physics and Applied Math from the University of California at Berkeley, an M.S. degree in Physics from Yale University, and a Ph.D. in Geology & Geophysics from Yale University. He contributed, with other IPCC authors, to the award of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize.  
Michael authored “The Hockey
Stick Chart and Climate Wars” and was at the center of the so-called bogus “Climate-Gate”. 
Jason Eric Box, PhD



Professor in glaciology at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland. He was for 10 years (2002-2012) at Byrd Polar Research Center at Ohio State University, eventually a tenured physical climatology and geography associate professor in the department of geography. He is also one of the members of the team doing field work for the Extreme Ice Survey and has led the Dark Snow Project, the first Internet crowd-funded Arctic expedition. 
He played a lead role in the  work for the Emmy-nominated
“Chasing Ice” documentary and was recently featured on Real Time with Bill Maher. 

Bill McKibben - Founder 350.org



The Boston Globe called him
""probably America's most important environmentalist."" Bill McKibben
is an author and environmentalist, whose 1989 book, The End of Nature. is
regarded as the first book for a general audience about climate change, and has
appeared in 24 languages. He is founder of 350.org, the first
planet-wide, grassroots climate change movement, including a driving force
behind the People’s Climate March in NYC. The Schumann Distinguished Scholar in
Environmental Studies at Middlebury College and a fellow of the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences, he was the 2013 winner of the Gandhi Prize and
the Thomas Merton Prize, and holds honorary degrees from 18 colleges and
universities; Foreign Policy named him to their inaugural list
of the world's 100 most important global thinkers. Rolling Stones
Magazine published his article, Global Warming’s Terrifying New Math in
2012, renewed the urgency of the Climate Crisis. 

Joe Romm, PhD - Founder, Climate Progress Blog





Joe Romm is a Fellow at American Progress and is the Founding Editor
of Climate Progress, which New
York Times columnist
Tom Friedman called ""the indispensable blog"" and Time magazine named
one of the 25 ""Best Blogs of 2010."" In 2009,Rolling Stones put Romm #88 on its list of 100
""people who are reinventing America.""Time named him a ""Hero of the
Environment″ and “The Web’s most influential climate-change blogger."" Romm
was acting assistant secretary of energy for energy efficiency and renewable
energy in 1997, where he oversaw $1 billion in R&D, demonstration, and
deployment of low-carbon technology. He is a Senior Fellow at American Progress
and holds a Ph.D. in physics from MIT.

""Climate Talk Radio"" might sound like a narrow topic, but in reality, it touches almost every aspect of our lives from A to Z (and more). 





Climate Talk Radio (CTR) is not your typical NPR “preach
to the choir” show. The choir was in the streets of Manhattan. They get it -
we've got about ten years to get this right, and we can do it! Renewable energy
costs have plummeted, crazy technology breakthroughs are happening every day. Major companies are taking the lead down the carbon-neutral
path and CEO's of some of the largest companies were marching right alongside us in
Manhattan. People are beginning to connect the dots on freakishly extreme
weather, and we will make it even more clear (something the mainstream media has flunked on frankly). When 400,000 people from all 50 states take to the streets with, 2600 global events, and the national media coverage was a collective shrug, then we need to keep the megaphone turned on!
The multi-media show (Streaming Net, the Mobile and
Tablet Apps, and streaming HD Video, then more terrestrial radio stations
and satellite radio as we grow) will be live and cover real ""Breaking
News"" and a myriad of topics with top name guests: top scientists,
entrepreneurs, CEO's and CSO's (Chief Sustainability Officer's) of companies
reducing their carbon footprint, student leaders, and organizations on the front
lines. CTR will be going to places all over the globe to really see the
wreckage climate change is already causing and the human toll, noting which nations
are kicking butts and taking names on renewable energy and where the ""smart
money"" is going on Wall Street (hint it's not into coal plants). 
BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS YOU - THE LIVE CALLERS FROM ALL 50 STATES!
The key ingrediant is that CTR will take live callers. You need to speak your peace, ask questions, deniers will have their shot (but good luck with that) and although I like podcasts (and will have them), ultimately, it will take interaction with ordinary Americans to truly bring them up to speed on the science, the urgency, and make Climate Talk Radio rise above the noise the deniers have been putting out for 20 years!

So what does Climate Talk Radio sound like? Is it boring?
(No Way!!)
CLIMATE TALK RADIO DEMO (# 1- Midterms brings the Big Climate Change Questions to the Big Debates and the Answers were uh...Interesting)

CLIMATE TALK RADIO DEMO (# 2- A caller defends
comical reporting by a Weather Channel ""Weathercaster"" on how 21 degrees
above normal in October is something everyone loves - ""who doesn't?"" And how does that work out in July for ya?)


UPDATE: Since this denier used John Coleman, Co-founder of the Weather Channel as his defense of the big climate hoax, the Weather Channel released a powerful statement rebuking him. 
Read all about it in Peter Sinclair's (our Climate Media Director at Climate Talk Radio) latest post. 
Weather Channel Humiliates Climate Denier John Coleman (Again) from www.ClimateCrocks.com.

think I'm afraid to speak truth to power...I was on Fox News defending the

What We Need & What You Get
 
But it all starts with a simple radio show. We need the basic radio equipment to broadcast and stream remotely, from wherever I am, and to produce, broadcast and air the show at our Flagship Station, 1480 AM in Washington DC from 4-6 PM daily in the nation's capital Washington. 
Imagine every cab driver in DC with Climate Talk Radio on their radio!

Since it is multi-media and interactive show and uses social media to support climate-friendly companies (and save money doing so) and to influence mainstream media and politicians, we will need the funds to build and run an awesome website (really a webtool) and a phone and tablet app. 
Members of Congress will be blasted on radio with something refreshing about climate change: THE TRUTH!




Look out Antiques Road Show , The Climate Road Show will unearth more hidden treasures, find the truth, and separate it from the 'junk radio"" that has been crying ""junk science"" for far too long. 
First stop. Rio De Janeiro. 
I've was accepted into Climate Reality's Leadership Corps. and attended the training, led by Al Gore himself and other experts in Rio November 4th-6th. After reading Al Gore's book in fact, Earth in the Balance I decided to use my Business Degree from the University of Michigan to get into this brand new field called ""sustainable development""? So I am now a Member of the Climate Reality Leadership Corps and available to present his famous slide presentation. 
I also interviewed a Brazilian legend who helped organize the famous Rio Summit, Dr. Israel Klabin, while in Rio, and now runs the Brazilian Institute for Sustainable Development and is playing a major role in upcoming UN negotiations.

Pitch in for a Poster - Get a print to frame for your office, or for your favorite climate denier. They will love it! Posters come with (or without) autographs. 



 

Take it with you everywhere - CTR the App. on your phone or tablet.





  The app that helps you support climate friendly companies and save money with ""Climate Coupons"" when you do! 

You can always listen live to CTR, get archived shows and
podcasts on your smartphone or tablet, but with your CTR app, you get last
minute deals from companies when you are signed up to Climate Coupons on your
app. There are growing numbers of companies that are moving down the carbon
neutral path and help speed the transition as sustainable enterprises. They
need our consumer support and we save money by creating volume. This will help
other companies to wake up and smell the carbon!
AND OUR STRETCH CAMPAIGNS ONLY BUILD ON THE RADIO SHOW AND EXPAND OUR MEDIA REACH ACROSS THE GLOBE.



From the first radio station in DC, to XM Sirius, to additional terrestrial radio stations and
then onto HD Video Coverage of the show. With new mobile video
production equipment, Climate Talk Radio will be a TV show as polished as any network
show online or ready for a national TV network. Everything is possible after we
get up and running our basic radio show on one key radio station, your phone
and tablet.

The Impact of Climate Talk Radio 

We are indeed at a tipping point in public opinion. People can see climate extremes with their own eyes, from Atlanta's ice storms, to Alaska's balmy 60 degree winter, to Australia's blazing 125 degree summers. California is in a 500-yr. drought, Michigan broke all snowfall records last winter and has had sustained extreme downpours and flooding this summer.  Hurricanes and tropical storms on both coasts and massive storm systems putting 40 million people in its path this summer. This ain't normal friends. 


Media has a major impact on public opinion (which affects policymakers) and national media has continued to focus on political food fights, celebrity nonsense, and crisises like Ebola and ISIS, which are real,  but will affect far fewer people than the hundreds of millions that will be affected and displaced by sea level rise, weather extremes, and the extraordinary costs to our nation's economy. They continue to act like the ""jury is out"" or there are two sides that carry equal weight and stage ""faux debates"", when that nonsense should have ended many many years ago. It's time our voices are heard so Americans can choose to continue down a ""business as usual"" path (which pretty much means game over), or choose to embrace the innovation, ingenuity and fortitude of the American spirit and ""bend history"". 



Risks & Challenges

Make no mistake, the fossil fuel interests like the Koch Brothers, will not like Climate Talk Radio because they have poured millions into media and the political system to keep the public confused, the politicians paralyzed, and zero action on climate change. 


The People's Climate March changed everything. People will fund Climate Talk Radio. CEO's of companies who marched alongside us on September 21st are companies well on their way to being carbon neutral will help us grow. Confused Americans will be Informed Americans demanding that their policymakers take action and embrace clean renewable energy technologies. Climate Talk Radio listeners will make clear to companies that they expect ""sustainability"" to be as important as next quarters profits (and will find that in fact it improves the bottom line). 


IT'S A GOOD THING I'M A WAR-TESTED VETERAN IN THE MEDIA WARS BECAUSE THE MEDIA NEEDS TO GROW SOME OVARIES ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND CALL IT LIKE IT IS!

And if you think I'm afraid to speak truth to power...I was on Fox News defending the Climate Scientist's being smeared by the fake ""Climategate Email Scandal"". Evoking shock because I ""insulted"" Rush Limbaugh's gross mischaractures, Calling out a shill for the climate denial industry, priceless. (See the video in the Extra's Video Gallery). 



IT WAS NOT NPR, IT WAS NOT THE CHOIR, IT WAS ""TALK RADIO"" 
I've been working on Climate Change for 21 years now from about every platform available: Presidential Award winning Activist who spearheaded the rebuilding of two flooded towns as models of sustainability in 1993, to helping launch the Chicago Climate Exchange (yes - cap and trade model), to pioneering progressive radio back in 1997 because Climate Denying hosts like Rush Limbaugh and all his clones spread the well-funded disinformation campaign to ""confuse the public"" on the science and consensus on climate change, to running three times for congress on the issue of Climate Change (and boy were they colorful)...
Nancy Skinner, the Politician 
First Race: Lost to POTUS (then a little-known state senator named Barack Obama) in the Illinois US Senate Primary in 2004. He ran on healthcare. I ran on climate change. Barack Obama (yes - I lost to POTUS, but what a cool honor that was and he ""heartily endorsed me"" during my 2006 race. 



Second Race: Nearly upset a 14 yr. incumbent in 2006. Robert Kennedy Jr. did my TV Endorsement Ads. 


Third Race: Narrowly lost in a three-way primary August 5th of this year. Once again, I ran on climate change.

<p></p></div>","Short Summary
Juan Carlos an I (Gabriel) are the co-founding partners of Siempre Verde. We are two brothers that are both passionate about the environment and share a love of trees. We try to spend time outdoors at every chance we get!

Faced with the facts:
· Mexico currently has the 7th largest annual net loss of forest area (FAO 2010)
· The population of Mexico consumes 2 million Christmas trees annually (USDA Foreign Agricultural Service, GAIN Report, 2012)
So we decided to start Siempre Verde!
Siempre Verde runs an environmental program that aims to substitute the consumption of cut-down Christmas trees with a more sustainable alternative. We offer customers a living Christmas tree with it's roots inside of a pot. We deliver the trees to each home and then return after the holidays to pick-up the living tree. We reforest all re-collected trees to reduce unnecessary logging and generate a large-scale reforestation program.
What We Need & What You Get



Siempre Verde was recently
selected form a large number of applicants to participate in Agora Partnerships' 2014 Accelerator Program. Agora's mission is to accelerate the success of early stage entrepreneurs committed to building businesses that create shared value and address critical and social challenges. The Agora Accelerator is an intensive program designed to give Entrepreneurs access to the knowledge, networks, and capital they need to succeed.
We need US$7,000 (seven thousand dollars) to pay the tuition fees and travel expenses associated with the Agora program. This acceleration program is very important
to Siempre Verde because it will provide us with the individual business consulting we need to grow our business. In particular, the program will help us build a tool-kit that will enable us to
develop a system of metrics that we can use to track, measure, increase and
communicate Siempre Verde’s environmental and social impact.



We really need your help
to participate in this amazing program. In case you need
an additional incentive, please look at the great perks that we are offering in return for your very generous donations.

us closer to participate in the program.Our Impact So Far


Siempre Verde has three main objectives:
Environmental impact
        - Avoid unnecessary loss of forest area        - Engage society in the construction of forests one tree at a time        - Preserve forests as chief carbon sinks and important home to wildlifeSocial development       - Generate more, higher-paid jobs year-round
       - Train Mexican Christmas trees farmers in the production of higher quality, more resilient Christmas trees & more accurate unearthing techniquesEconomic sustainability
       - Capture 5% of Mexico's total Christmas tree market share by 2018
       - Continue converting cut down Christmas tree customers to live Christmas tree customersSiempre Verde tested out the concept in 2010 and sold 2,000 living Christmas trees in three days. Once we had proven the concept, we sold 4,000 living Christmas trees in 2011 and 4,500 living Christmas trees in 2012. The trees from 2010 and 2011 have been reforested in a natural protected area in Puebla, Pue., Mexico and have a survival rate higher than 80%. The trees from 2012 were reforested in collaboration with the local Ministry of Environment (""SEDEMA"") and the Mexico City Administration (""GDF"") during the 2013 rainy season (survival rates will be gathered in 2014).THE CHRISTMAS TREE INDUSTRY: PLENTY OF ROOM FOR SIEMPRE VERDE TO CREATE IMPACT

Annual worldwide Christmas tree consumption is close to 100 million (breakdown
below). 

Mexico - 2 million (USDA Foreign Agricultural Service, GAIN Report,
     2012)
USA – 33 million (USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service,
     2012)
Canada – 6 million (Census of Agriculture Statistics Canada, 2012)
Europe – 50 million (Chastagner, Gary A. and Benson, D. Michael.
     The Christmas Tree: Traditions, Production and Diseases, Plant Management
     Network International, October 13, 2001)

We believe that our proposed solution has the potential to create enormous impact worldwide. If we were able to standardize both unearthing
techniques and tree survival rates at 85%, there would be an annual 85,000 ha of new
reforested areas. That is equal to the daily oxygen requirement of 3,780,702
people.


The US Christmas
tree industry employs 100,000 people (USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service, 2012) and the US market represents one third of total Christmas tree consumption.  Unearthing a tree is more
labor intensive than cutting it down, therefore 150,000 additional jobs could be
created if all Christmas tree markets used the Siempre Verde method.

<p class=""p2"">Regardless of the evidence showing both the significant loss of koala populations and the economic value of the koala to Australian tourism, governments at every level over a number of decades, have failed to act to save this harmless, defenceless, beautiful animal.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Milions of dollars have been raised by lobbying groups, but this has failed to save the koala.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Today, there are localised extinctions; where small populations remain, they cling to life in over-developed urban environments, or pockets of forest now isolated by highways, cleared farm land and housing estates, their narrow gene pool further exacerbating risks to their viability. </p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>Extinction in my lifetime is a real possibility. The answers to three simple questions are critical to reversing this trend:</strong> </p>
<ol class=""ol1"">
<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1""> How many are left?</span></li>
<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1""> Where do they live?</span></li>
<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1""> In what condition, with what issues?</span></li>
</ol><p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">But not a single government agency, lobbying or conservation group could answer any one of those questions. Location information, </span>health and points of impact is critical to public infrastructure decisions, development, risk mitigation and koala conservation.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Yet to-date, every single one of the koala habitat maps used for public policy and public debate have been determined by pixel color on satellite images. </p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>However accurate the technology - and there is much evidence to question the accuracy - these maps are not about the location of koalas. They are about the location of trees. </strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">The koala was finally listed as vulnerable under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act on April 30th, 2012,  in the states of Queensland, New South Wales, and Australian Capital Territory only.</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>Listing was assessed and rejected in 1996 and again in 2006. The Threatened Species Scientific Committee recommended against it again last year. </strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">The reason? Despite the marked decline in populations, the “body of data on koala populations is patchy, often sparse and not nationally comprehensive or coordinated.” (QWeekend, April 14-15, 2012)</p>

<h2>Crowdsourcing Koala Location Intelligence</h2>
<p class=""p2""><strong>I self-funded the creation of a national crowdsourced koala map: <span class=""s2""><a href=""http://www.koalatracker.com.au"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.koalatracker.com.au</a>, launched in February, 2010</span>.  </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">KoalaTracker.com.au is Australia’s national crowdsourced koala map, recording location intelligence of koala populations in (for the most part) the urban wild, actual points of impact, and causes of death and injury for the public record, as submitted by concerned citizens. Anyone can access this map, the database, the photos.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Membership to the site is free, the database searchable, the database, map and photos free to use for non-commercial purposes. </strong></p>
<p>We bulldoze the life out of vast tracts of koala forest for endless housing developments, oblivious to the fact remnant populations of koalas remain. It might not appear to be koala habitat from space, it certainly may not be high value habitat, but this is where koalas live. And die. </p>
<p><strong>See the photo gallery on this campaign for photos of the map and impacts.</strong></p>
<p>KoalaTracker shows the impacts are cars, dogs and disease. Clearing and fragmenting habitat (where the koalas live) and forcing koalas on the ground to traverse roads and yards to find more food or mates; putting koala populations under extreme stress, causing malnutrition and susceptibility to disease; isolating populations, weakening the gene pool and immune system.</p>
<p>All of these risks can be mitigated, if we know where the koalas live, and where these impacts are ocurring. </p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>What we needed was a map to show where koalas were living in the wild; a map that showed us what was decimating the population, and whereabouts. </strong></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>What the <em>koala needed</em> was community engagement. <strong>It needed someone to tell the stories, to give koalas a voice in the decision making.</strong></strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">KoalaTracker puts that and more, on the public record. Bob Irwin, lifelong wildlife advocate and father of Steve Irwin, Crocodile Hunter, describes it as exceptional.</p>
<p class=""p2"">KoalaTracker proves the government maps are wrong. It engages the community in koala conservation; it inspires them to report sightings, to call rescue groups when they see an injured koala, and to act on the koala's behalf in their own neighbourhoods. </p>
<p class=""p2"">It provides visual evidence of the movement of koalas across major roads seeking food; it shows the details of domestic dog attacks; the incidence of disease in distinct population groupings. All of this is invaluable not just to a handful of researchers or government officers - but to all of us. </p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>It delivers unexpected information too, such as historical sightings data, and most exciting, uncommon, if not unknown information...such as koalas drinking water, swimming (in the sea and in rivers), eating flowers and bark, eating non-eucalypt leaves such as paperbark, macadamia and camphor laurel leaves, and termite dirt. And did I mention, spectacular photography of koalas in the wild?</strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">It may be citizen science, but it shows how little we really know about this smart, adaptable and simply adorable animal. KoalaTracker is accurate, it is national, it is comprehensive, and it is free.</p>
<p><strong>Mapping the location of alive, dead and injured koalas, with causes, dates and details, empowers the community in advocacy for specific areas; it enables effective risk mitigation by local government in terms of signage, fencing, lighting, speed zones and more; it provides the necessary foundation of facts for informed public policy and infrastructure planning at every level of government; it ensures informed corporate and community decisions, and empowers communities to watch, and watch out for their resident koalas.</strong></p>

<p class=""p2"">A war over energy is being fought in backyards across the country as millions of Americans are being impacted. The era of cheap and easy energy is over. Now, the price is higher and so are the stakes.</p>
<p class=""p2"">I've talked to people all across the country who have seen their neighborhoods turned into industrial zones because of extreme extraction and they are scared. It not only locks us into a future of catastrophic climate change, but is already endangering our health, our communities, our food, precious resources like water, and the safety of workers in virtually every state in the country.</p>
<p class=""p1"">If we are going to have any hope of breaking the political divide that stymies progress on environmental issues, we are going to have to understand the personal aspect of our energy decisions. I decided to launch Hitting Home to chronicle the growing number of moving personal stories that can shift the debate on energy. </p>
<h3 class=""p1"">The Nitty Gritty</h3>
<p class=""p1"">I plan to spend three months traveling with Meghan Nesbit who has worked for over a decade helping to empower communities and social change movements. We'll be journeying across the country documenting the reality of extreme extraction -- meeting people in their homes and on their land -- to truly convey the gravity of what we stand to lose. We will also chronicle the growing public movement fighting against dirty energy and their powerful backers. </p>
<p class=""p2"">As we know, frightening statistics from scientific studies hasn't ignited enough action -- we need a deeper societal shift that can move the political mountains. It will take a kind of compassion for our fellow humans (and fellow creatures) that I believe can be spurred by personal stories.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Our journey is a project of the nonprofit news organization AlterNet where I have worked for the last six years as a senior editor and writer, heading up AlterNet’s coverage of environmental issues. We'll be documenting our experiences with updates from the road, including a travel blog, video profiles of the people we meet, photo essays, and in depth-feature stories. The end of the trip will culminate in a multi-media e-book that shows the human face of our energy decisions, the power structures that keep fossil fuels afloat, and the rising movement that is taking action and creating alternatives. </p>
<p class=""p1"">This trip is simultaneously about diving deep into the personal, listening to people talk about their experiences, hopes, and fears. But it's also a big picture look at how our energy decisions are playing out right now and what will happen if we do not change course. </p>
<p class=""p1"">I believe the stories from this project will have a broad reach. They will be published on AlterNet which has more than 2.5 million unique monthly visitors and we will be partnering with print, online, and broadcast partners to reach as many people as possible.</p>
<h3 class=""p1"">What We Need</h3>
<p class=""p1"">We already have a generous donor to help with our vehicle, an amazing Cricket trailer, and support from AlterNet to pay my salary while I’m on the road. But we still need to raise money for trip expenses and production quality photography and video equipment, even though we’ll be doing this as cheaply as we can (hello, campgrounds!). We’re grateful for anyone who can contribute financially — big or small. Your donation is tax-deductible and will go entirely to trip expenses and publishing.</p>

The end of the trip will culminate in a multi-media e-book that shows the human face of our energy decisions, the power structures that keep fossil fuels afloat, and the rising movement that is taking action and creating alternatives. 
This trip is simultaneously about diving deep into the personal, listening to people talk about their experiences, hopes, and fears. But it's also a big picture look at how our energy decisions are playing out right now and what will happen if we do not change course. 
I believe the stories from this project will have a broad reach. They will be published on AlterNet which has more than 2.5 million unique monthly visitors and we will be partnering with print, online, and broadcast partners to reach as many people as possible.
What We Need
We already have a generous donor to help with our vehicle, an amazing Cricket trailer, and support from AlterNet to pay my salary while I’m on the road. But we still need to raise money for trip expenses and production quality photography and video equipment, even though we’ll be doing this as cheaply as we can (hello, campgrounds!). We’re grateful for anyone who can contribute financially — big or small. Your donation is tax-deductible and will go entirely to trip expenses and publishing.
If you can’t give but want to support the project, please help spread the word in whatever way possible — share with family, friends, movers and shakers.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Our first documentary film, produced in 2011 and shown at the Vientianale Film Festival, targeted an adult audience with messages on the environmental and health reasons for reducing plastic bag use and recycling plastic materials.</p>
<p>The second video we are producing, tentatively titled “Lao Youth Battle Plastic Waste Invasion,” will target a younger audience, from ages 6 to 16.</p>
<p>The dissemination of plastic bags (PB) in Vientiane continues unabated. In 2008, SERCASIA began to study the PB invasion in Vientiane and now sees the problem has spread all over the country. In short, too many people, Lao citizens and foreigners, are not conscious or not informed about the extent of the problem. In a previous paper we have estimated that 144 million PB were used per year in Vientiane Province alone. The problem is increasing rapidly to the rest of the country along with commercial and industrial  development. Plastic waste is growing at the same rate as the cash economy. </p>
<p>Our short film is intended to help persuade young audiences to restrain using PB, and other plastic products such as plastic cups, Styrofoam containers, etc. This video would like to show and reward the good behaviour of people who REFUSE to use PB and other plastics… Plastic’s not cool!!</p>
<p>SERCASIA is planning to shoot the video, place it on YouTube, and distribute it in schools, colleges, the Lao youth movement, and commercial places where young people gather.</p>
<p>The projected budget for production and distribution is US$5.000. To raise this amount, we are seeking socially concerned donors who can contribute partial funding. </p>
<p>The number of sponsors behind the project is as important as the total sum collected. The main objective is to show the campaign is being supported by many donors/ funders. Their support for the effort to reduce the amount of plastic waste in the capital city of Lao PDR will be seen and appreciated by many.</p>
<p>The creative content of the video may consist of one or more vignettes and these may be acted in mime for visual, attention-grabbing effect and for universal understanding.</p>
<p>Among the “story-board” concepts being considered for the video are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two adult clowns are “playing” with PB and tossing other plastic around and inadvertently recover a child clown</li>
<li>A man or woman who buys food and other items comes back with goods wrapped in PB… and the PB keeps piling up on a table,  while his/her twin goes to market with a recycled bag and does not have to deal  with piles of PB</li>
<li>Supplies of food are delivered to a restaurant where food in PB, until the entire kitchen is covered in and littered with PB. The waiters end  up selling plastic bags instead of food</li>
<li>A toddler is given a plastic bag to play with, and we see the toddler growing and the same PB following the growing character. The PB does not disappear even when the character is 100 years old</li>

<h4>                                             LOOSE ENDS</h4>
<p>Hi Mark, </p>
<p>This message is just to tidy up some loose ends. Perhaps, the most
important aspect of your perception of my plan <i>(<b>not surprisingly</b> - seeing as
you have obviously spent very little time investigating the information I have </i><span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span><i style=""background-color: initial;"">provided )  </i><span style=""background-color: initial;"">is your overall picture of </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">The Perfect Escape - </b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">which I plan to
provide our guests</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Let me stress that everything, in this message, has already been covered on many of my web pages. I would also like to point out that I do not think you will find any guest more </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">“picky”</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">and harder to please</b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">
than </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">ME</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> - in regard to </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">marine tours</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> of any kind.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I have spent my entire life </span><i style=""background-color: initial;"">(from an early age)</i><span style=""background-color: initial;""> in a wide
variety of </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">”Tropical Paradises”</b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">
– and I am obviously </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">spoiled rotten</b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">
- in this regard. Consequently, you would have to </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">PAY ME</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">–</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> somewhere in
the vicinity of</span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">,</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">the price of any tour</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> - to get me
to go on it. I guess this would also apply to a tour </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">on </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">your yacht</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> – although, I might give you a </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">50% discount</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> on my price – seeing as you are a good friend. Don’t
get me wrong - I am quite sure I would be very comfortable. </span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">However, my main problem is </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">a very low threshold of boredom</b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">. I think that  more </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">adventurous <i>(purpose driven)</i> activities</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> will be required - than you are equipped for - or accustomed to
providing - in order to keep me from </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">being</span><b style=""background-color: initial;""> bored out of my skull</b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">. At the other end of the spectrum, I would likely demand a payment of
</span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">3 times the price</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> to join
an </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">extreme adventure tour</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> of any
kind. As to </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">cruise ships</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> - in my
opinion, they combine <b>the worst of all possible worlds</b>.</span><br/></p>
<p>So what sort of a tour <b>WOULD</b> provide <b>The Perfect
Escape</b> for me and hopefully a very wide range of others - including <b>my children</b>-and
<b>their children</b> – <b>AND</b>, I would like to think, <b>you and Sue and Tashi.</b>  One thing for sure, it would not involve <b>""floating around in the middle of the ocean - mindlessly fishing for a straight week"". </b></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Where on earth do you get these ideas from – you must

<h3>Risks</h3>
<p>No doubt, there are <b>many risks </b>we may have to deal with, in relocating our <b>""non-operation""</b>. However,<b> THE ONLY MAJOR RISK</b> is <b>whether or not</b> we can <b>FIND</b> <b>SUFFICIENT RATIONAL people - or CONVERT SUFFICIENT people to RATIONALITY </b><i>(or any combination of the above)</i> to provide <b>SUFFICIENT </b><b>funding</b> to deal with these other risks. </p>
<p><b>From </b><b>my perspective,</b> it seems unlikely<b>. However,</b> there <b>HAS to be</b>  a <b>BUNCH</b> of <b>rational</b> people hiding somewhere - to create all this <b>amazing ""stuff"". </b>I suspect <b>many </b>may be hiding in <b>Silicon Valley</b>, However, I have no clue how to contact them.  Perhaps you have an idea or two. </p>
<p>I hope to soon ""welcome you aboard"" - <b>figuratively</b> - and later<b> literally - </b>and that<b>, unlike most, </b>you <b>UNDERSTAND </b>the difference between the two. If you should choose to make a <b>contribution.</b> I hope you  also <b>UNDERSTAND</b> that the future value of your <b>$25 U.S contribution </b>and my <b>$250,000 U.S. investment </b>are <b>both entirely</b> <b>dependant on our success</b> - in helping a few others to <b>UNDERSTAND our project. </b></p>

Highly rational, LITERATE individuals are required to fill this role as they need to be capable of  CLEARLY understanding -   WHY (in light of the multitude of inherent substantial advantages this operation will enjoy) the totally outrageous numbers above and below are, in fact, rational, reasonable and fairly accurate. THIS PARAGRAPH IS THE KEY TO THE SUCCESS OF THIS CAMPAIGN AND THIS PROJECT

Not being  capable of understanding the above is a direct result of a desperate, unshakeable, clinging to wilful, lazy, collective INSANE STUPIDITY which, unfortunately, according to Einstein (and I have been sadly forced to endorse) is apparently extremely common. 



Clearly, individuals of the former description are few and far between - and difficult to find - on planet earth . No doubt, Mars might provide better pickings. However, that option may be a bit problematic at the moment. 
All I can do then is continues to hope for a few individuals to turn up - who are willing to battle the tide of collective insane stupidity - which threatens to sweep everyone along with it - and focus on finding THE TRUTH  - wherever it happens to be hidden.

      It could be that the totally outrageous numbers above                              may merit a little further investigation                                                          perhaps, starting here                                                    A few functioning brain cells and a little focus may be required  -                                 along with a basic grasp of readin, ritin & rithmetic.                                                                Rocket science is not a requisite.

                north coast - Trinidad - our ""playground""   

                                   we can hang out here  

                          or maybe do a little peaceful fishing                                                                 here          here        here 
         FISHING FOR FOOD AND FOR FUN
We make no claims to be a ""SPORT - FISHING"" operation and we will be trying to avoid that label - and all its connotations. We will be spending a lot of time FISHING for FOOD - and having a lot of FUN doing it - as our species has been doing for millenniums, However, torturing fish in the name of ""SPORT"" is not ""our thing"". 
If we are fortunate enough to catch more than we need, we will be selling the surplus to help cover expenses. That being said (for novice and expert alike) we will be providing a UNIQUE fishing experience of incredible variety, and non stop action - unlike anything they have ever experienced. With us, you will never here those often used words ""That's why they call it FISHING - and not CATCHING"",  


There will be a few peaceful occasions on our fishing trips (from time to time) and, of course, unlimited supplies of the finest freshest seafood you will ever eat. To go along with the latter, there will be a wide selection of exciting Caribbean dishes and  exotic tropical fruit.

In regard to ""peace and serenity"", there will be plenty to be had - during the evenings at our wonderful rustic Island home - and during our alternative non fishing days - when you may peacefully laze about ""down d islands"" (accompanied, you can be sure, by a few ""Trinis"")  to you heart's content.

The latter assumes you can resist the allure of our 24 ft. ""Mini Illusions"" - which will be ready to take you off on your own personal ""Magic Carpet Ride"" of exploration, discovery and adventure ""down d islands"". Mind you, they can also be used to transport you to your own private oasis of ""peace and serenity"".

These ""Mini Illusions"" will also be towed out with us to our offshore fishing area - to serve as fishing tenders - thereby, enabling the pursuit and capture of very large fish - WITHOUT creating total chaos with all the other fishing systems - operating simultaneously from Grand Illusion. 


In addition to providing another UNIQUE exciting activity for our guests,  LARGE mature individual fish (such as tuna, swordfish and grouper) make for some of the finest eating. All in all, after a week with us, experiencing the entire spectrum  - from action and adventure to peace and serenity, it will likely be a difficult task - dragging yourself back to boring, stressful reality. 
                            
                        IMMEDIATE GOAL
I am out of time in MY NOVICE EFFORT to secure funding for the completion of my project to relocate our 76 ft. sail assisted, power catamaran Grand Illusion to Trinidad and start up my planned operation there - and I am starting this new campaign - limited to funding the first step in that project - namely, preparations for and the staging of sea trials- here in Margarita, Venezuela - with our current team. 90% of the components for the  sailing rig and the high speed trolling systems (required for these runs)  are already on hand and just need installation. Getting Grand Illusion back in top shape and installing the (dry assembled) top deck completes the list of preparations required.
Sea trials will provide  concrete, irrefutable evidence that my planned Trinidad operation will be extraordinarily successful. This evidence will consist of videos, written records and first hand experience - regarding the performance of Grand Illusion in brisk, open ocean ocean, trade wind conditions - and the productivity of our high speed trolling systems.

The latter will provide very accurate projections for the purely commercial  high speed trolling operation which will be the first aspect of our Trinidad operation and will continue to provide substantial  revenues - as other aspects of the operation come on line. In the meantime, despite radically lower fish prices in Venezuela,  sea trials will  provide significant revenues, through fish sales here in Margarita.

MOST IMPORTANTLY however, the results of these sea trials will provide us with the CREDIBILITY and  VISIBILITY to, FIRST and FOREMOST, put together THE best possible Trinidad Team to - 1. help with raising AMPLE capital  - to ensure a smooth, rapid successful  relocation to Trinidad - and 2. to set up and run the planned Trinidad operation (under my direction) with an extremely high level of efficiency,  effectiveness, productivity and profitability.

Obviously, our ""perks"" are of no use UNTIL Grand Illusion is FULLY operational in Trinidad. However from successful trial runs in Margarita to successful BASIC operations in Trinidad is just a matter of a 120 mile day trip. From BASIC operation to FULL operation in Trinidad is just a matter of making suitable arrangements for the use of THE RIGHT ""down d islands"" House - and setting up our offshore Fish. Aggregating. Device. system.  
         MORE ABOUT OUR AMAZING PERKS
In an overabundance of caution the start date for the delivery of our perks has been  set at June 2017. However, we have every reason to believe that our actual start up of full operations in Trinidad and our ability to deliver on our perks will be way before that date.

Except for the  current featured perk  (a ""NO BRAINER"" MEMBERSHIP) we only provide 1 type of perk- namely, a membership in The Perfect Escape. The only things that change, as time goes on, are - the name - the number available - and the size of the contribution required to claim this perk. Please be sure to claim your perk(s) -  if and when you choose to contribute.



Let us assume you were an early $25 U.S. Contributor and  claimed 1 ""NO BRAINER"" MEMBERSHIP. Further assuming that you  claimed 4 ""BONUS"" MEMBERSHIPS, would leave you with a total of 5 memberships. This would entitle you to 10 places on any Perfect Escape tour - on a reserved basis - or on a standby basis - or any combination of the two.
Let us stipulate a 1 week, all inclusive, tour price of $1,500 U.S. per person (as par for the course) and an average NET commission to you of 15 % - or $225 U.S. per person. Assuming you were able to sell (per annum - to friends and acquaintances)  anywhere from 1 place on 30 tours to 10 places on 3 tours, this  would result in 30 sales - for a total of $6,750 U.S. - in commissions. 

Naturally, the number of trips per annum, one chooses to participate in, would have no effect on the above numbers. As such, if one chooses to no longer have any contact with The Perfect Escape, one would have a fairly valuable asset to sell -  namely, 1 ""NO BRAINER"" MEMBERSHIP (which cost $25 U.S.)  along with 4 ""BONUS"" MEMBERSHIPS  - which were  FREE.
As to what someone might be willing to pay for a small, zero overhead,  zero operating costs ""business"" which generated net annual revenues of $6,750 U.S.  - plus providing personal holiday discounts - who can say? However, (using a conservative price / earnings multiple of 10 ) - would put a value right at  $67,500 U.S.  - not bad for a $25 U.S. ""contribution""
So - let us say we have been 10 times too optimistic - and instead of making   30 sales a year we only make 3 sales a year. As a result, instead of making $67,500 U.S. in capital gains on our $25 U.S. contribution (after a couple of years of operation) we only make $6,750 U.S. It seems that it would be  insanely stupid - to expect this news to send most of our early contributors running to the nearest windows and leaping to their deaths.

Which is why they are named ""NO BRAINER""  MEMBERSHIPS. If every thing goes well, some version of the the above range of scenarios will apply to you. If everything goes horribly wrong you lose $25 U,S. (not your home or your business or your farm or your first born child or a pound of flesh) $25 U.S. 


The classic definition of  ""NO BRAINER"" is that a decision  is so obviously the right one - that it does not require the use of one's brain - hence the name. Some might claim that my rather advanced age and consequent propensity for dropping dead of a heart attack might constitute a valid rational reason for NOT assuming the enormous, scary, stressful risk of a $25 U.S. contribution 
However, considering the relatively short time frame between assuming  this risk and our operation being totally viable - under ANY reasonably capable management, one may as well assert that the risk of a younger founder being killed by a cement truck was a valid reason for not investing in his project.  
NOTWITHSTANDING all of the above, there is NO QUESTION that if 40 individuals should claim these perks - and make NO further efforts  whatsoever towards securing further contributors (in the short term) and guests (in the longer term)  NO ONE will likely ever see a single reward for their contribution or investment.


                                      TRINIDAD OPERATION

The FULL Trinidad operation is described at length and in detail on the web page THE PERFECT ESCAPE - PART 2.  A brief synopsis follows (in the form of a letter to and old friend and owner/operator of a large luxury yacht) which may provide you with an insight into The Perfect Escape  - from a deeper perspective.

                                                 
                                             LOOSE ENDS
Hi Mark, 
This message is just to tidy up some loose ends. Perhaps, the most
important aspect of your perception of my plan (not surprisingly - seeing as
you have obviously spent very little time investigating the information I have  provided )  is your overall picture of The Perfect Escape - which I plan to
provide our guests
Let me stress that everything, in this message, has already been covered on many of my web pages. I would also like to point out that I do not think you will find any guest more “picky” and harder to please
than ME - in regard to marine tours of any kind.
I have spent my entire life (from an early age) in a wide
variety of ”Tropical Paradises”
– and I am obviously spoiled rotten
- in this regard. Consequently, you would have to PAY ME – somewhere in
the vicinity of, the price of any tour - to get me
to go on it. I guess this would also apply to a tour on your yacht – although, I might give you a 50% discount on my price – seeing as you are a good friend. Don’t
get me wrong - I am quite sure I would be very comfortable. 
However, my main problem is a very low threshold of boredom. I think that  more adventurous (purpose driven) activities will be required - than you are equipped for - or accustomed to
providing - in order to keep me from being bored out of my skull. At the other end of the spectrum, I would likely demand a payment of
3 times the price to join
an extreme adventure tour of any
kind. As to cruise ships - in my
opinion, they combine the worst of all possible worlds.
So what sort of a tour WOULD provide The Perfect
Escape for me and hopefully a very wide range of others - including my children-and
their children – AND, I would like to think, you and Sue and Tashi.  One thing for sure, it would not involve ""floating around in the middle of the ocean - mindlessly fishing for a straight week"". 
Where on earth do you get these ideas from – you must
think I am crazy. Oh  - I
forgot - you do - along with many others. First of all, you
need to take into account where we are
at this time geographically and otherwise  My plan (since I have been here on Isla Margarita, Venezuela) was to operate 1 week ""glam
camping"" tours on Isla Blanquilla – about 50
miles north of Margarita. However, that dream has gone down the drain– along with the
dreams of most Venezuelans.
Trinidad (120 miles away) has
no Isla Blanquilla, but I am a Trinidad citizen and it does
have “down d islands” -15 minute from
the excellent marine and general
facilities on the mainland - at Chaguaramas , As such, a large island house (augmented by glam- camping facilities) will make a wonderful rustic but very comfortable “base camp” for
our 1 week tours – built  around 3 very comfortable
exciting and productive open ocean fishing day trips - for the whole family.
These trips would be similar to our trips to the Autec buoy off Nassau in The Bahamas on Little Trick. However, obviously with our 76 ft. Grand Illusion there will be - much more comfort - variety
- excitement - exhilaration - and production. These trips will specifically NOT
be focused on emulating your typical SPORT- FISHING trip - but rather on providing a modern version of artisanal / recreational hook and line
fishing - which has been providing family
groups with food and fun for millenniums.
It should also be kept in mind that half the time on these trips will be spent in fast, exhilarating  motor sailing (specifically designed to emulate a pure sailing experience) to and from our extensive F.A.D. fishing system - with the added excitement and exhilaration provided by our UNIQUE, innovative, commercial, high speed trolling system which will thrill ALL our guests and which the more adventurous  may choose to participate in. 
While ""FOOD & FUN FISHING"" will be the ostensible purpose for these trips. Our extensive, innovative,  open ocean  F.A.D. (Fish Aggregating Device) system will provide a ""WONDER - FULL"", UNIQUE, rich, exhilarating - yet peaceful environment which (with our huge variety of gear ) our guests will be able to take FULL advantage of - in a myriad of ways.
On
Sundays we plan an
inshore trip to Cyril bay - a
wonderful hidden paradise nestled in
the rain forest on the rugged north coast of Trinidad - where I happen to have
spent a few great childhood years. The other 2 days of our tour will be spent just “messing about - down d islands” – as Trinidad families have been doing for many
generations. 
While there is a variety of night life available, a short boat
ride away, at Chaguaramas, I would expect that, (after a super exhilarating day at sea on Grand Illusion or ""simply messing about - down d islands"") on most evenings, our guests will opt for
simple activities - at our charming rustic island home. Mind you, a few of the younger
fishing fanatics may be into a little night fishing from Grand Illusion - anchored a hundred yards or so away.

All in all we will be providing a UNIQUE, innovative, exciting version of
an “AUTHENTIC Trinidad experience”– and a far cry, it would seem, from the very negative image you have been carrying around in your head. For god's sake Mark - don't  be an ""old fuddy duddy"" - thinking that the generations of today want exactly the same boring contrived product which luxury charter yachts have been serving up for them - for the last century.
There is an AUTHENTIC Goldilocks zone (between the CONTRIVED decadence offered by luxury yacht and cruise ships on the one hand and the equally CONTRIVED extreme adventure tours on the other hand) which I have been very familiar with all my life and find very pleasing - as does virtually everyone - WHEN AND IF, they  are fortunate to experience it, We intend that The Perfect Escape will fit right into that Goldilocks zone and consequently keep our guests and their friends coming back for more. 




                  TESTIMONIAL


Robby,
 I am in the process of garnering statements from Gardner Young about LITTLE TRICK, he was taken to Georgetown 160 miles South of Nassau for the Regatta on board Little Trick. 
Being an Off Shore Power Boat Racer he was bemused by the tiny outboard motor - but very quickly, crossing the banks in the teeth of a 20 knot SE wind, he soon realized that this was a boat from another dimension. First of all it was incredibly stable and dry which is to say that he had no problem mixing and drinking the cocktails that celebrated this magic carpet. 

Averaging 20 knots with a single 100 h.p. outboard, they made the passage to Georgetown in 8 hours of stable running, most likely consuming more gin then gas!. Gardner, who was critical of the design and low horsepower was won over.
The design remains unique. However, like so many brilliant and forward thinking designs in every discipline it will languish away until sometime in the not too distant future will 'discover' it and with the proper financing and publicity make a fortune.You are a Marine Visionary Robby and I just wish to hell those who reject your ideas could see this and profit, financially and spiritually, from them.All the best, KrovThe Rt. Hon Krov Menuhineco - credentials - Spirit of The Bahamas

Risks
No doubt, there are many risks we may have to deal with, in relocating our ""non-operation"". However, THE ONLY MAJOR RISK is whether or not we can FIND SUFFICIENT RATIONAL people - or CONVERT SUFFICIENT people to RATIONALITY (or any combination of the above) to provide SUFFICIENT funding to deal with these other risks. 
From my perspective, it seems unlikely. However, there HAS to be  a BUNCH of rational people hiding somewhere - to create all this amazing ""stuff"". I suspect many may be hiding in Silicon Valley, However, I have no clue how to contact them.  Perhaps you have an idea or two. 
I hope to soon ""welcome you aboard"" - figuratively - and later literally - and that, unlike most, you UNDERSTAND the difference between the two. If you should choose to make a contribution. I hope you  also UNDERSTAND that the future value of your $25 U.S contribution and my $250,000 U.S. investment are both entirely dependant on our success - in helping a few others to UNDERSTAND our project.

<p>The proposed research activities will generate three distinct data sets, which will be disseminated by publishing a series of three journal articles in relevant academic journals and will also be presented at relevant academic and water management conferences. This study will use interview and archival methods and discourse analysis to accomplish three research objectives: (1) to investigate the actions of the actors and institutions behind the failure to resolve the longest water conflict in U.S. history; (2) to investigate the extent to which metropolitan Atlanta’s growth machine of urban and suburban development is contingent upon the production and distribution of massive quantities of freshwater from the ACF Basin; and (3) to explore how the dominant discursive production of the “water crisis,” emphasizing the <em>natural-ness</em> of water scarcity, has allowed powerful economic and political interests to further capital-intensive economic development in Atlanta and state-building in Georgia. In this context, the study will examine the extent to which these interests have pressured the principal federal water management agency, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), to adopt neoliberal governance practices that favor greater water concessions for metropolitan Atlanta, at the expense of the States of Florida and Alabama.</p>
<p>This inquiry will be conducted using a variety of qualitative research methods. Structured and semi-structured interviews with water regulators, state and federal policymakers, and major industrial representatives will determine the trends in freshwater consumption among the various stakeholders to the ACF water conflict, including the sources and competing uses of water among the conflicting states. This data will generate a grounded theory demonstrating the stakeholders’ attitudes toward the conflict and toward one another, the unique and contingent obstacles facing each stakeholder at various points during the conflict’s history, and each stakeholder’s goals and strategies used to overcome the water conflict.</p>
<p>Textual and discursive analytical techniques will then be used to critically evaluate the competing claims to power over the waters of the ACF River Basin. Press articles, public pronouncements, public and corporate documents, and media campaign documents will be collected and dramaturgically coded to produce a detailed chronological genealogy of the conflict. The focus here will be on the language employed to argue and propagate selected positions on the water “crisis.” This study offers the hypothesis that Georgia’s stakeholders have used a discourse of water scarcity to construct a self-serving interpretation of the water conflict, which differs greatly from the interpretations by stakeholders in Alabama, Florida, and USACE and that this constructed discourse claims that water scarcity results from drought conditions rather than ineffective resource management. By constructing a discourse of natural water scarcity, Georgia’s water regulators have been able to delay conflict resolution for almost two decades, thus sustaining metropolitan Atlanta’s economic growth and maintaining the region’s comparative advantages in order to further attract water-intensive industrial development.</p>
<p><strong>Intellectual Merits</strong></p>
<p>The intellectual merit of this study is that this will be the first study to empirically examine the role of combined and uneven development in the resolution of the growing crisis over limited freshwater among the States of Alabama, Florida, and Georgia.

<h3><strong>About me</strong></h3>
<p>Hi there! I was born in Paris in 1985. Through a love of the outdoors and fortuitous hiking, I came to develop a fascination with glaciers and all things polar. I studied Physical Geography at the Paris VII University, sharing time between Paris and the Alps. After completing my Master degree, I moved to Alaska to work on a Fulbright-funded project aiming to better understand the dynamics of frozen ground. Later on, I focused on the study of Arctic glaciers with satellite images at the University of Alberta in Canada. I also pursue lattes with vigor.</p>
<h3><strong>What is Chasing Ice in Alaska?</strong></h3>
<p>The plan is to travel to southeast Alaska to be part of an expedition that will travel across the Juneau icefield with scientific purposes from June 23d to August 18th 2013. The expedition is organized by the Juneau Icefield Research Program (JIRP), the longest continuous research study of a glacial system in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>The Juneau icefield is the fifth largest in the Western Hemisphere, covers approximately 4,400 square km (1,700 square miles) and feeds 35 large glaciers. We'll hike, cross rivers and mosquito forests and ski during 2 months over 200 km (125 miles), camp and check the glacier's vitals.</p>
<p>The main mission is to contribute to understand the dynamics of glacier systems as they relate to climate by collecting data on the icefield. Central to this understanding is the monitoring of glacier velocities and surface elevation changes. Through time, tracking these changes will provide key insights into climate change.</p>
<h3>Why it matters</h3>
<p>First, by contributing to this project you are a part of the effort aiming at better understanding glaciers/climate relations and you'll be in a sweet spot to hear a little about the story of one of the great frozen places on earth.</p>
<p>Second, this is the opportunity of a lifetime for a young glaciologist! With fellow scientists I'll gain crucial and intense fieldwork experience, learn and practice new skills (crevasse rescue...), manipulate scientific equipment, use new gear, get finally well acquainted with a terrain I have been studying for years via satellite images. This expedition will provide me with great stories to share. All this is exciting, brilliant for my career, and will give me a headstart for my doctoral program.</p>

Now I'm combining the desire to help people, my medical doctor's spirit, with my real estate experience, to reach homeowners in danger of losing their homes to short sales or foreclosures, and to reach lenders with my new HELPPR (""helper"") plan that saves homes for the owners, and prevents loan losses for the lenders. We have real estate attorney and CPA approval of the plan, and it has worked!</p>
<p class=""p2"">There are millions of Americans threatened with the loss of their homes. Your contributions will help us get the publicity to let everyone know about the HELPPR plan, especially the executives who run the companies that service the loans and arrange for loan modifications. This new plan will make them really want to modify loans to help borrowers keep their homes, because the plan prevents lender loan losses too.</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">We are trying to raise $5,000 to pay for publicity and press releases, and for mailings to lenders and their loan processing executives.

Now I'm combining the desire to help people, my medical doctor's spirit, with my real estate experience, to reach homeowners in danger of losing their homes to short sales or foreclosures, and to reach lenders with my new HELPPR (""helper"") plan that saves homes for the owners, and prevents loan losses for the lenders. We have real estate attorney and CPA approval of the plan, and it has worked!
There are millions of Americans threatened with the loss of their homes. Your contributions will help us get the publicity to let everyone know about the HELPPR plan, especially the executives who run the companies that service the loans and arrange for loan modifications. This new plan will make them really want to modify loans to help borrowers keep their homes, because the plan prevents lender loan losses too.

<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<p><strong>Challenges we need help with;</strong><strong><br/></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Capacity Building-build a bigger workshop, train more technicians</strong></li>
<li>M<strong>ass produce</strong> the eco stoves &amp; branding</li>
<li>
<strong>Mechanise our production</strong> for capacity &amp; quality</li>
<li>Establish <strong>agreement with solar suppliers better still Make solar assembling at our workshop. </strong>this will cut-out the middle man which will reduce on the over all cost of an Eco stove making it much more affordable</li>
<li>Build relationship with our suppliers for other materials to benefit from credit facilities.</li>
<li>Hold workshops, awareness and training session to <strong>change behaviour</strong> -Make Eco stove a household product</li>
<li>Establish <strong>more branches</strong> to east, west, northern parts of Uganda.</li>
<li>E<strong>xtract more reusable stones</strong> so people can easily adopt the stove with more confidence of their availability.</li>
<li>Teach briquette making skills. Briquettes are currently a secondary source of fuel. the residues are used as fire starters and the skill gained will also earn them an income especially for women and unemployed youth.</li>
<li>More <strong>Research and Development</strong><strong> </strong>to <strong>perfect</strong> Eco stove.<strong> </strong>we need to do more research into the product so that we do not need to use the briquette as fire starters which will make it more user friendly.</li>
<li>Sustainability. we have a product, we have come this far, with the additional support, we will be able to be self sustaining in 1yr</li>
</ol>
<p>Through our exhibitions, road demos and extensive market research since 2010, we established that the need for the Eco stove is huge, the demand is high, our production capacity is very low. With the pilot Eco stoves project since 2011. the feedback has been exciting and encouraging. Adoptation was swift and Participating families have saved on average over 90% on their cooking fuel cost, we need to spread the same effect/benefit across Uganda, One family at a time. then to the Sub-sahara Africa.</p>
<p>The added benefits have encouraged regular use of the Eco stove thus achieving our core goals and objective, in the process, doing our bit to reduce on environmental degradation, climate change and Global warming.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>A bit about Uganda;</strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>Uganda has a Population of 35.6 million (UN, 2012) its Capital is Kampala, it seats on Area: 241,038 sq km (93,072 sq miles), Major languages: English (official), Swahili (official), Luganda, various Bantu and Nilotic languages, Major religions: Christianity, Islam, Life expectancy: 54 years (men), 55 years (women) (UN). It is a land locked country but was once rich and can still have food security if good practices are adopted. It is surrounded by lakes and rivers. we have national parks, the source of River Nile, rivers which are excellent for rafting, Dames, the Equator crosses Uganda, mountains such as Mt Rwenzori which has 4 seasons. Major tourist attractions, some, we will be happy to show our supporters once they visit. we have had a lot of media support and companies who are not able to financially support our cause but have offered us such perks as we offer them to you.</em><br/></strong></p>

<h2><strong>Why Is Eco stove right for the people??</strong></h2>
<p>Through our market research and pilot Eco stoves since 2011, the participating household appreciated the Eco stove innovation and its added benefits.</p>
<p>The innovation is smoke free for the benefit of a cooking child or woman, zips the ever increasing charcoal cost, adds value tot he entire family and reduce on the environmental degradation.</p>
<p>The benefits of an Eco stove compared to any other stoves on the market in the Uganda today.  in brief these are; <em><strong>environmental, social, economic, health and technological benefits; With An Eco stove,</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Environmental aspects;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced rate of deforestation,-90% 0f Ugandans depend on charcoal or firewood as their only source of cooking fuel, 10% can afford the recurring cost of gas or electricity monthly bill and only 1% use bio-gas</li>
<li>Reduced soil Erosion and its effects-mad slides due to deforestation for charcoal market</li>
<li>Reduce Drought and growing food shortage due to dry and infertile land</li>
<li>Reduce landfill/waste management by making briquettes used as fire starters</li>
<li>Reduce CO2 emissions/greenhouse gasses</li>
<li>Reduce wood consumption-due to the reusable stone</li>
<li>Save hectares of Wood land trees</li>
<li>Challenge fire Risks in glass thatched houses </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Social aspects;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>women spending time with family due to Less time spent cooking</li>
<li>No more child missed classes in search for firewood/for a quick buck</li>
<li>Gender balance- stones are readily avalable and easily accessed by special interest groups (Women headed homes, disabled and the old)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Health Aspect;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No hospital bills due to indoor smoke (IAP) greatest most killer in africa-No more smoke inhalation for cooking women &amp; children</li>

<li>Ergonomics &amp; safe to the touch</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Your support.</strong></p>
<p>WE need your support - financial support so as to continue in our Research and Development to make the Eco stove A household clean cook stove in Uganda, Africa and beyond where charcoal and firewood is predominantly the main source of cooking fuel. we need to mechanise our production to achieve the desired impact. we need to be able to own a solar assembling workshop or buy solar in bulk in order to benefit from bulk purchase discounts which will reduce the over all cost of the Eco stove. The need to train trainers who will teach local people the  briquette making skills so that they can learn to process their household waste into briquettes instead of contributing to land-fill which is used as fire starters for Eco stoves. We also need expert advise and support in this firld. Please <em>Stand with us, help us take this innovation to the people of Uganda, help us make it accessible &amp; affordable to the people who will greatly benefit from it, in the process, they will stop cutting down trees to cook which will positively impact on climate change.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Even when you cannot financially support us, you can network for us, spread the word for us. We are creating an Eco stove system, which is not yet fully accurate and yet to go on the Global market. Hence this is not our final clean cook stove. Through this campaign, you may contribute  any way possible and your input will affect the final design and characteristics of this cooking revolution for most</strong></em>.

Mass produce the eco stoves & branding

Mechanise our production for capacity & quality
Establish agreement with solar suppliers better still Make solar assembling at our workshop. this will cut-out the middle man which will reduce on the over all cost of an Eco stove making it much more affordable
Build relationship with our suppliers for other materials to benefit from credit facilities.
Hold workshops, awareness and training session to change behaviour -Make Eco stove a household product
Establish more branches to east, west, northern parts of Uganda.
Extract more reusable stones so people can easily adopt the stove with more confidence of their availability.
Teach briquette making skills. Briquettes are currently a secondary source of fuel. the residues are used as fire starters and the skill gained will also earn them an income especially for women and unemployed youth.
More Research and Development to perfect Eco stove. we need to do more research into the product so that we do not need to use the briquette as fire starters which will make it more user friendly.
Sustainability. we have a product, we have come this far, with the additional support, we will be able to be self sustaining in 1yr

Through our exhibitions, road demos and extensive market research since 2010, we established that the need for the Eco stove is huge, the demand is high, our production capacity is very low. With the pilot Eco stoves project since 2011. the feedback has been exciting and encouraging. Adoptation was swift and Participating families have saved on average over 90% on their cooking fuel cost, we need to spread the same effect/benefit across Uganda, One family at a time. then to the Sub-sahara Africa.
The added benefits have encouraged regular use of the Eco stove thus achieving our core goals and objective, in the process, doing our bit to reduce on environmental degradation, climate change and Global warming.
 
A bit about Uganda;
Uganda has a Population of 35.6 million (UN, 2012) its Capital is Kampala, it seats on Area: 241,038 sq km (93,072 sq miles), Major languages: English (official), Swahili (official), Luganda, various Bantu and Nilotic languages, Major religions: Christianity, Islam, Life expectancy: 54 years (men), 55 years (women) (UN). It is a land locked country but was once rich and can still have food security if good practices are adopted. It is surrounded by lakes and rivers. we have national parks, the source of River Nile, rivers which are excellent for rafting, Dames, the Equator crosses Uganda, mountains such as Mt Rwenzori which has 4 seasons. Major tourist attractions, some, we will be happy to show our supporters once they visit. we have had a lot of media support and companies who are not able to financially support our cause but have offered us such perks as we offer them to you.

 

Why Is Eco stove right for the people??
Through our market research and pilot Eco stoves since 2011, the participating household appreciated the Eco stove innovation and its added benefits.
The innovation is smoke free for the benefit of a cooking child or woman, zips the ever increasing charcoal cost, adds value tot he entire family and reduce on the environmental degradation.
The benefits of an Eco stove compared to any other stoves on the market in the Uganda today.  in brief these are; environmental, social, economic, health and technological benefits; With An Eco stove,
Environmental aspects;

Reduced rate of deforestation,-90% 0f Ugandans depend on charcoal or firewood as their only source of cooking fuel, 10% can afford the recurring cost of gas or electricity monthly bill and only 1% use bio-gas
Reduced soil Erosion and its effects-mad slides due to deforestation for charcoal market
Reduce Drought and growing food shortage due to dry and infertile land
Reduce landfill/waste management by making briquettes used as fire starters
Reduce CO2 emissions/greenhouse gasses
Reduce wood consumption-due to the reusable stone
Save hectares of Wood land trees
Challenge fire Risks in glass thatched houses 

Social aspects;

women spending time with family due to Less time spent cooking
No more child missed classes in search for firewood/for a quick buck
Gender balance- stones are readily avalable and easily accessed by special interest groups (Women headed homes, disabled and the old)

Health Aspect;

No hospital bills due to indoor smoke (IAP) greatest most killer in africa-No more smoke inhalation for cooking women & children
Minimum fire accidents (due to safe insulation) tasted and certified by Uganda bureau of standards
Safe, Neat, Durable, Portable and meets all health and safety laws
Can be operated/used and handled by anyone and everyone

 
Economic aspects;

2 years re-usable heat retention stones-saves loads of cooking fuel Money=$17-$35 -per week to cook, in a year, the cost of cooking fuel is above $800. an improved lifestyles for the entire family who will save this money by using an Eco stove
Employment and Apprenticeship opportunities; skilled/unskilled frofor production-supply-maintainance, in all parts of the country for easy access
Entrepreneurship opportunities-through training (Agents, maintenance/repair centres and monitoring of the eco stoves across the country)
Training and skills development opportunities-(stove manufacturing, distribution, solar assembling, briquette making)
No more firewood shortage/ hunting/collection challenges

 
Technology aspect;

With a Modern Look/accessories, state- of -the Art in the cooking technology, it will encourage every owner to actually use it regularly.
With 2 bulb light-enables rural school children extra reading time who would otherwise not afford over night kerosene bills- providing them improved grades and a brighter future
With 2 phone charging previsions = saves travel and charging fees to the trading centres where electricity can be found.
Cooks efficiently and consistently and half the time- its acceptable and functional and easy to operate by anyone
Ergonomics & safe to the touch

Your support.
WE need your support - financial support so as to continue in our Research and Development to make the Eco stove A household clean cook stove in Uganda, Africa and beyond where charcoal and firewood is predominantly the main source of cooking fuel. we need to mechanise our production to achieve the desired impact. we need to be able to own a solar assembling workshop or buy solar in bulk in order to benefit from bulk purchase discounts which will reduce the over all cost of the Eco stove. The need to train trainers who will teach local people the  briquette making skills so that they can learn to process their household waste into briquettes instead of contributing to land-fill which is used as fire starters for Eco stoves. We also need expert advise and support in this firld. Please Stand with us, help us take this innovation to the people of Uganda, help us make it accessible & affordable to the people who will greatly benefit from it, in the process, they will stop cutting down trees to cook which will positively impact on climate change.
Even when you cannot financially support us, you can network for us, spread the word for us. We are creating an Eco stove system, which is not yet fully accurate and yet to go on the Global market. Hence this is not our final clean cook stove. Through this campaign, you may contribute  any way possible and your input will affect the final design and characteristics of this cooking revolution for most. THANK YOU",16.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>It’s not rocket science. People need to understand the risks and

their resource base, their access to financial capital, and policies that
support this self-sufficiency. </p>

How can we address the threats of climate change? 
How can we help the people who are most vulnerable to changing weather
patterns, an increase in intense and disastrous storms, and threatened
food/water security? 
By helping people help
themselves. 
Many of us have rallied to help people in need after disaster
strikes. Remember Haiti? What about helping people beforehand, so that when disaster happens the results won’t be so destructive? Let’s help before so many lives are lost, before people are left helpless.
The Solution
It’s not rocket science. People need to understand the risks and

What does this have to
do with you? 

You can make this
possible. Whether you are in California, Colorado, New York, Australia, Oregon,
Mexico, Vermont, Spain, Florida or anywhere in between, a little support from
you can help thousands of people. 
We have to start somewhere.

<p>My name is Samantha Bankston, and with your help my collaborators and I will be able to 
purchase a few acres of land in the Colorado Rockies in order to make available to the public a space to live deliberately, sustainably and in accordance with the virtues of 
simplicity, creativity and slow time in order to construct an off-the-grid  artist/philosopher/writer/architect/construction/designer/etc. collective summer retreat.<br/></p>
<p>While I am the public face of this vision, there are many others who have dedicated themselves to accomplishing it--visual and graphic artists, academics, open source programmers, and educators all with the same mission: to create a learning-and-living environment that runs counter to the current, broken educational model of specialization, competition, emphasis on assessment, bureaucracy, and the preference of profit seeking over knowledge.  Instead, we wish to create a series of collaborative summer workshops, involving experts in a variety of fields who will teach each other while literally constructing the retreat. Rather than repeat the antagonistic, unequal, hierarchical model of administrators versus faculty versus students, our summer 'retreat' is project oriented, and every student is a teacher and vice versa.  The collective of permanent, core organizers will all participate in the functioning and orientation of the summer workshops.  What this means is: no hierarchy, no bureaucracy or administration, and no bosses, but collective organization of shared tasks.<br/></p>
<p>For instance, one summer session (of varying lengths, depending on participant interest and rotation) may be themed around the construction of a greenhouse.  Our educational 'school', run similarly to the <i>La Borde </i>clinic in France, will have an emphasis on absolute sustainability, outdoor labor, and the study of theory and artistic activism.  A typical day would involve 
varied tasks (e.g. an hour gardening; two hours working on a 
designated project outdoors, such as installing 
solar panels for the greenhouse; two hours learning critical theory, with the rest of the 
day free to work on creative projects and to collaborate with the other 
attendees).  The accomplishment of this vision is still a few years off,
 which is why the current focus is in the initial phase of acquiring the land.</p>
<p>It might initially seem contradictory to acquire land, private property, to alleviate the very ills that landed property has created, but buying the land enables us to reclaim it for the public, or in philosophical terms, ""deterritorialize"" the land for the sake of the common good, including creating an alternative educational experience (fundamentally structured like the ""Rolling Jubilee"" campaign).<br/></p>
<p>While it would be too daunting to try to fund the entire project at once, we've decided to incrementally fund our vision in stages, rather than over-commit with money we do not yet have.</p>
<p>These are the stages set for our ultimate goal of running a summer series of collaborative, non-hierarchical workshops:</p>
<p><b>Stage 1. Purchase at least $10,000 worth of land in the Colorado Rockies</b></p>
<p>Much of the land we are looking to purchase has either been tracked as rural residential land, cut into subdivisions (this is where most small acreage occurs), or land afflicted by recent forest fires (where we may replant and rehabilitate the land with trees native to the area), patented mining claims, or land designated as ""hunting grounds,"" which would be converted to non-hunting grounds.  <br/></p>
<p>During this phase, individuals are encouraged to write to us and request time to spend on the undeveloped land, camping, writing, and creating.<br/></p>
<p>After the acquisition of the land, the collaborators will live and work on the land during the summers, both saving money for the construction of facilities and building said facilities.  Even if Stage 1 is the only successfully funded stage, the land will, at the very least, be used to facilitate creative individuals with a vision for fully sustainable living and learning.<br/></p>
<p><b>Stage 2. Construction of living quarters and lodge: off-the-grid, fully sustainable ""tiny"" houses and/or cabins, and a central building.<br/></b></p>
<p>This step is multi-tiered and depends upon future campaigns and saving funds, working in the summer when we are not teaching, and depending on our resources could take around five years to accomplish.  The speed at which this phase is completed depends upon financial means, which is why it's crucial for us to begin spending our summers, unburdened by rent and utilities, on the land while saving money and simultaneously constructing buildings step by step.  <br/></p>
<p>During this phase, a limited number of those with ""tiny"" houses, tent campers, and self-sustainable vehicles may come enjoy the land while contributing to Stage 2.</p>
<p><b>Stage 3.  Construction, philosophical study, artistic live-and-work summer residency <br/></b></p>
<p>After the completion of initial structures, such as a couple of cabins and/or ""tiny"" houses, then we can truly begin our ongoing vision of building a sustainable community in rotation with workshop/seminar style learning, focusing on philosophy (engagement with the root of societal problems, and creating imaginative solutions), as well as getting virtually ""off-the-grid"", with workshops on open source alternatives to proprietary software and intellectual property.</p>
<p>This stage is truly the processural phase where our vision comes to life, where rotating tasks are completed in concert with collegium style studies conducted by teachers-as-students and students-as-teachers.  During Stage 3 we aim to construct a greenhouse, another cabin, canoes, full solar power, and an art studio.</p>
<p><b>Stage 4. Continued education in the outdoors and accomplishment of vision</b></p>
<p>The vision is that of rotating tasks and enjoying ""slow time"": gardening, building and learning, studying high theory, and other interconnected areas of knowledge, supplemented with individual or collective interdisciplinary free time for creative projects.  This step will include themed project series throughout the summer with flexible residencies for participants.  <br/></p>
<p>As it is important to rescue education from the traps of debt peonage, costs to residents will be minimal (to help run a 'retreat' that will already be 100% self-sustainable, without a mortgage, without utilities, and with the use of participant labor).</p>
<p>This final step is a perpetual renewal of the vision in an immersive, integrative educational experience.</p>
<p><b>*The current focus is the funding of Stage 1, the acquisition of the land*</b><br/></p>
<p>During the first stage, my collaborators and I will live on this land during the
 summers in a self-sufficient converted school bus while working on the land and writing books for publication.  We welcome participants at this time to contribute to our vision with their time, share the land, and 
slow down: to create, to finish a dissertation, to write, etc., while simply communing with nature.  This land is <i>our </i>land, as Woody Guthrie sings, and what is mine is yours.<br/></p>

<br/>
<p></p>While I am only one piece of this campaign puzzle, I am the primary organizer of the campaign. There are many others who have pledged their time and effort to this endeavor.

<p>I was born and raised in Boulder, Colorado where I cultivated a deep love for the Rocky Mountains.  For the past 10 or so years I have been outside of Colorado, living in New York City, where I earned a Master's degree in philosophy at The New School for Social Research, and then I moved to Indiana to complete a joint Ph.D. in philosophy and literature at Purdue University.  Since then I have lived and worked in France, Denmark, and currently, Lake Tahoe, California.  </p>
<p>I, like many Ph.D. graduates of my generation, have accrued the cost of 
an education in exchange for a deliberative life of creativity and 
connection to the land.  It is important that we not allow financial 
indebtedness to amount to an 
indebted existence, toiling away for survival for the rest of our 
lives.  This campaign seeks to construct a life as a work of art, of 
simple means that will
 afford people time...time to write, create, and reconnect with
 the sublime beauty of the land.  By helping one another, we are able to
 carve alternative, unique paths of freedom.<br/></p>
<p>As many of you probably know, academia and the humanities are in peril.  While I am fortunate enough to have a job as a professor at a small liberal arts college, my small salary only covers subsistence, and I thus live paycheck to paycheck.  The elevated cost of living in Lake Tahoe, where I teach, is part of the reason I am dedicated to providing a space for others to live simply, and spend summers learning, working with the land, and forming relational bonds in the Rockies of Colorado.</p>
<p>Professionally, I publish essays and books in the area of European philosophy.  Currently, I am writing a book on the French philosopher Gilles Deleuze for Bloomsbury Publications entitled <i>Deleuze and Becoming(s)</i>.  I've also published essays and translations in a variety of anthologies, and I translated the book, <i>Deleuze and Art</i>, by Anne Sauvagnargues from the original French for Bloomsbury/Continuum in 2013.  Unfortunately, academic publication does not pay and is a labor of love.  Yet, research and writing offers its own reward--sharing ideas with the rest of the world--and I wish to do so during my summers in Colorado.  For a more comprehensive professional bio, please see: <a href=""http://www.sierranevada.edu/academics/humanities-social-sciences/faculty/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.sierranevada.edu/academics/humanities-social-sciences/faculty/</a> </p>
<p>Personally, I care deeply for the state of the world, social and environmental justice, and animal rights.  I love the mountains most of all; art (in all its forms) fascinates and moves me; the majority of my days are filled with philosophy, analyzing theory and imagining new modes of thought and expression.  There is a sense of urgency in this one life we have to lead, and the more time passes, the more I have felt beholden to a prefabricated existence that identifies money with success, thus the greater the urgency has become for me to unplug to focus on creative ideas that offer an alternative through writing and living. For those elements of society we find unacceptable, harmful, and stultifying, we must resist and advocate a healthier path; this is why I have decided to approach you all, and the crowd-funding platform: to create the means toward a freer, more deliberative life.  I am only a part of a collaborative team of artists, professors, graphic designers, sustainability experts, sustainable gardening specialists, and open source computer programmers. <br/></p>
</div> <div>
<ul><li><b>The funding needed is at least $10,000 to purchase the land</b></li></ul>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/941360/files/20141018214513-beautiful-mountain-hiking-trail-aspen-trees-vail-colorado-summer-tree-grove-ski-resort-35016671.jpg?1413693913"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>As mentioned, the first stage, and the current campaign, is to simply acquire the land.  While, say, 5 acres of land go for $30,000+ in the mountains of Boulder County, or 10 acres of off-grid land go for $20,000 in Gunnison County, there are 1-4 acre parcels of land (in a variety of counties in the Rockies) that can be purchased with $10,000; fire stricken land may be substantially cheaper.  We thought it better to start lower in hopes of meeting our goal.</p>
<p>The only risk in not meeting the goal is insufficient funding, and if this is the case, any money received will go toward the purchase of a smaller parcel of land, and I will contribute all of my birthday/holiday money that I have saved over that last several years (~$7,000) to ensure that the goal is accomplished.  As stated above, at the very least, this land will be used as a respite for others who share our vision.<br/></p>
<ul><li><b>The significance of this campaign</b></li></ul>
<p>This campaign extends globally.  If successful, it proves that we can all band together under one goal, which is often made materially impossible by student debt, and forge deliberative lives in communion with the land.  We can show that despite our relative positions of poverty, while supporting one another, even in small ways, we can create a sea change in the organization and values of society.  <br/></p>
<p>Furthermore, this land provides the space for individuals who could not otherwise afford it--space to slow down, unplug, and work on all the creative projects they've set aside while struggling to make ends meet.  This campaign takes a hammer and smashes Sisyphus' rock!</p>
<p>And while the immediate, first goal is to acquire land for sustainable living and writing, the ultimate goal is to revolutionize education, replacing it with the aforementioned model--a residential school that focuses on a well-rounded, outdoor education, creativity, philosophical theory and critical engagement with the greatest problems our world faces.  This educational vision is one where those with expertise lead various workshops, and the line between student and teacher converges.  </p>
<p><i>Our core values include:</i><br/></p>
<p>*100% sustainable, solar powered living</p>
<p>* Pursuing knowledge for its own sake<br/></p>
<p>* Defining success by communal action, relations, and creative production</p>
<p>* Offering a high level of education without recourse to student debt</p>
<p>*A holistic approach to creative education that involves diverse activities, from tending the land, to learning philosophical and political theory, to performing acts of art</p>
<p>* Empowering the people<br/></p>
<p>* Absolute equality for all living systems</p>
<p>* Respecting others' skills and eliminating hierarchical forms of organization and their subsequent, unequal power structures</p>
<p>* Physically grounded, face-to-face educational experience</p>
<p>*Recognizing the global ecological and labor crises and finding an alternative to the socioeconomic system that deadens us, exploits others, and exploits the biosphere</p>
<p>*Collaboration with like-minded individuals and other groups<br/></p>
<p>* Creating a revolutionary educational experience that is light, that dances</p>

 which is why the current focus is in the initial phase of acquiring the land.
It might initially seem contradictory to acquire land, private property, to alleviate the very ills that landed property has created, but buying the land enables us to reclaim it for the public, or in philosophical terms, ""deterritorialize"" the land for the sake of the common good, including creating an alternative educational experience (fundamentally structured like the ""Rolling Jubilee"" campaign).
While it would be too daunting to try to fund the entire project at once, we've decided to incrementally fund our vision in stages, rather than over-commit with money we do not yet have.
These are the stages set for our ultimate goal of running a summer series of collaborative, non-hierarchical workshops:
Stage 1. Purchase at least $10,000 worth of land in the Colorado Rockies
Much of the land we are looking to purchase has either been tracked as rural residential land, cut into subdivisions (this is where most small acreage occurs), or land afflicted by recent forest fires (where we may replant and rehabilitate the land with trees native to the area), patented mining claims, or land designated as ""hunting grounds,"" which would be converted to non-hunting grounds.  
During this phase, individuals are encouraged to write to us and request time to spend on the undeveloped land, camping, writing, and creating.
After the acquisition of the land, the collaborators will live and work on the land during the summers, both saving money for the construction of facilities and building said facilities.  Even if Stage 1 is the only successfully funded stage, the land will, at the very least, be used to facilitate creative individuals with a vision for fully sustainable living and learning.
Stage 2. Construction of living quarters and lodge: off-the-grid, fully sustainable ""tiny"" houses and/or cabins, and a central building.
This step is multi-tiered and depends upon future campaigns and saving funds, working in the summer when we are not teaching, and depending on our resources could take around five years to accomplish.  The speed at which this phase is completed depends upon financial means, which is why it's crucial for us to begin spending our summers, unburdened by rent and utilities, on the land while saving money and simultaneously constructing buildings step by step.  
During this phase, a limited number of those with ""tiny"" houses, tent campers, and self-sustainable vehicles may come enjoy the land while contributing to Stage 2.
Stage 3.  Construction, philosophical study, artistic live-and-work summer residency 
After the completion of initial structures, such as a couple of cabins and/or ""tiny"" houses, then we can truly begin our ongoing vision of building a sustainable community in rotation with workshop/seminar style learning, focusing on philosophy (engagement with the root of societal problems, and creating imaginative solutions), as well as getting virtually ""off-the-grid"", with workshops on open source alternatives to proprietary software and intellectual property.
This stage is truly the processural phase where our vision comes to life, where rotating tasks are completed in concert with collegium style studies conducted by teachers-as-students and students-as-teachers.  During Stage 3 we aim to construct a greenhouse, another cabin, canoes, full solar power, and an art studio.
Stage 4. Continued education in the outdoors and accomplishment of vision
The vision is that of rotating tasks and enjoying ""slow time"": gardening, building and learning, studying high theory, and other interconnected areas of knowledge, supplemented with individual or collective interdisciplinary free time for creative projects.  This step will include themed project series throughout the summer with flexible residencies for participants.  
As it is important to rescue education from the traps of debt peonage, costs to residents will be minimal (to help run a 'retreat' that will already be 100% self-sustainable, without a mortgage, without utilities, and with the use of participant labor).
This final step is a perpetual renewal of the vision in an immersive, integrative educational experience.
*The current focus is the funding of Stage 1, the acquisition of the land*
During the first stage, my collaborators and I will live on this land during the
 summers in a self-sufficient converted school bus while working on the land and writing books for publication.  We welcome participants at this time to contribute to our vision with their time, share the land, and 
slow down: to create, to finish a dissertation, to write, etc., while simply communing with nature.  This land is our land, as Woody Guthrie sings, and what is mine is yours.
A little bit about myself...



While I am only one piece of this campaign puzzle, I am the primary organizer of the campaign. There are many others who have pledged their time and effort to this endeavor.

I was born and raised in Boulder, Colorado where I cultivated a deep love for the Rocky Mountains.  For the past 10 or so years I have been outside of Colorado, living in New York City, where I earned a Master's degree in philosophy at The New School for Social Research, and then I moved to Indiana to complete a joint Ph.D. in philosophy and literature at Purdue University.  Since then I have lived and worked in France, Denmark, and currently, Lake Tahoe, California.  
I, like many Ph.D. graduates of my generation, have accrued the cost of 
an education in exchange for a deliberative life of creativity and 
connection to the land.  It is important that we not allow financial 
indebtedness to amount to an 
indebted existence, toiling away for survival for the rest of our 
lives.  This campaign seeks to construct a life as a work of art, of 
simple means that will
 afford people time...time to write, create, and reconnect with
 the sublime beauty of the land.  By helping one another, we are able to
 carve alternative, unique paths of freedom.
As many of you probably know, academia and the humanities are in peril.  While I am fortunate enough to have a job as a professor at a small liberal arts college, my small salary only covers subsistence, and I thus live paycheck to paycheck.  The elevated cost of living in Lake Tahoe, where I teach, is part of the reason I am dedicated to providing a space for others to live simply, and spend summers learning, working with the land, and forming relational bonds in the Rockies of Colorado.
Professionally, I publish essays and books in the area of European philosophy.  Currently, I am writing a book on the French philosopher Gilles Deleuze for Bloomsbury Publications entitled Deleuze and Becoming(s).  I've also published essays and translations in a variety of anthologies, and I translated the book, Deleuze and Art, by Anne Sauvagnargues from the original French for Bloomsbury/Continuum in 2013.  Unfortunately, academic publication does not pay and is a labor of love.  Yet, research and writing offers its own reward--sharing ideas with the rest of the world--and I wish to do so during my summers in Colorado.  For a more comprehensive professional bio, please see: http://www.sierranevada.edu/academics/humanities-social-sciences/faculty/ 
Personally, I care deeply for the state of the world, social and environmental justice, and animal rights.  I love the mountains most of all; art (in all its forms) fascinates and moves me; the majority of my days are filled with philosophy, analyzing theory and imagining new modes of thought and expression.  There is a sense of urgency in this one life we have to lead, and the more time passes, the more I have felt beholden to a prefabricated existence that identifies money with success, thus the greater the urgency has become for me to unplug to focus on creative ideas that offer an alternative through writing and living. For those elements of society we find unacceptable, harmful, and stultifying, we must resist and advocate a healthier path; this is why I have decided to approach you all, and the crowd-funding platform: to create the means toward a freer, more deliberative life.  I am only a part of a collaborative team of artists, professors, graphic designers, sustainability experts, sustainable gardening specialists, and open source computer programmers. 
 
The funding needed is at least $10,000 to purchase the land


As mentioned, the first stage, and the current campaign, is to simply acquire the land.  While, say, 5 acres of land go for $30,000+ in the mountains of Boulder County, or 10 acres of off-grid land go for $20,000 in Gunnison County, there are 1-4 acre parcels of land (in a variety of counties in the Rockies) that can be purchased with $10,000; fire stricken land may be substantially cheaper.  We thought it better to start lower in hopes of meeting our goal.
The only risk in not meeting the goal is insufficient funding, and if this is the case, any money received will go toward the purchase of a smaller parcel of land, and I will contribute all of my birthday/holiday money that I have saved over that last several years (~$7,000) to ensure that the goal is accomplished.  As stated above, at the very least, this land will be used as a respite for others who share our vision.
The significance of this campaign
This campaign extends globally.  If successful, it proves that we can all band together under one goal, which is often made materially impossible by student debt, and forge deliberative lives in communion with the land.  We can show that despite our relative positions of poverty, while supporting one another, even in small ways, we can create a sea change in the organization and values of society.  
Furthermore, this land provides the space for individuals who could not otherwise afford it--space to slow down, unplug, and work on all the creative projects they've set aside while struggling to make ends meet.  This campaign takes a hammer and smashes Sisyphus' rock!
And while the immediate, first goal is to acquire land for sustainable living and writing, the ultimate goal is to revolutionize education, replacing it with the aforementioned model--a residential school that focuses on a well-rounded, outdoor education, creativity, philosophical theory and critical engagement with the greatest problems our world faces.  This educational vision is one where those with expertise lead various workshops, and the line between student and teacher converges.  
Our core values include:
*100% sustainable, solar powered living
* Pursuing knowledge for its own sake
* Defining success by communal action, relations, and creative production
* Offering a high level of education without recourse to student debt
*A holistic approach to creative education that involves diverse activities, from tending the land, to learning philosophical and political theory, to performing acts of art
* Empowering the people
* Absolute equality for all living systems
* Respecting others' skills and eliminating hierarchical forms of organization and their subsequent, unequal power structures
* Physically grounded, face-to-face educational experience
*Recognizing the global ecological and labor crises and finding an alternative to the socioeconomic system that deadens us, exploits others, and exploits the biosphere
*Collaboration with like-minded individuals and other groups
* Creating a revolutionary educational experience that is light, that dances



Ways you can help!Thank you for reading this far.  The best way to help is, of course, to donate money.  I understand that many of us cannot donate large sums of money, but it is the number of individuals who donate that counts.  ""Liking"" our campaign on Facebook is a great start, and taking a moment to donate only a few dollars truly helps build the campaign's momentum.  https://www.facebook.com/coloradocollectiveretr...Even if you can only afford a $5 donation, forgoing a cup of coffee or glass of wine for the day, I urge you to please do so.  There's no donation too small, and every penny is met with profound gratitude.Please spread the word--email, share the campaign on social media, talk to your friends.  Again, thank you.Indiegogo has sharing tools to enable you to share the campaign with ease. Thank you in advance for helping us realize our dream for a just education, and for helping us all live a more deliberative and contemplative life.  Love,Samantha and TeamP.S. All ""perks"" (postcards, polaroids, etc.) will be sent out immediately after our campaign ends :)",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

Following the success of past endeavors in support of rhino protection, this year’s trek will see students team up with conservationists to hike up to Everest Base Camp in branded full-bodied rhino costumes. As global awareness of rhino poaching has increased, we are happy to be joined by interested parties and conservation scientists. This diverse group hopes to stand at the base of the World’s highest mountain, making a bold statement against rhino poaching.
Everest Base Camp via Gokyo lakes and the three high passes is no ordinary hike. The group will have to ascend three passes over 5 000m, with the final destination being 5 545m above sea-level. This is a challenge to any hiker as one is confronted with the ever-changing weather conditions and high altitude.








The Impacts:

Most of the world has become aware of the dangers the rhino species is facing. Rhinos are being driven to the edge of extinction and we want to make a difference!
Our goal this year is for Climbing4Rhino to raise over R100 000 for rhino related projects under the wing of the Lawrence Anthony Earth Organization. One of their key projects is the Fundimvelo Thula Thula Rhino orphanage, which is the only such facility in KwaZulu Natal. This state of the art facility sees to the rescue, rehabilitation and release of orphaned rhino.

SUPPORT NEPAL! After the devastating earthquake that struck Nepal and surrounding regions this year the people of Nepal are in desperate need of support. Since their main source of income come from tourists it is crucial that we get as many as possible hikers on this years trek. The Rhino Trekkers are personally responsible for covering all costs relating to their trip and the funding needed for a trip of this magnitude is quite a lot. YOU CAN HELP MAKE THIS HAPPEN!

We hope to achieve all this through the climb participants as well as fundraising events held in the build-up to the climb.
So where is the money going?
The funding goal for this campaign is to raise funds for rhino projects. In addition we also want to help sponsor hikers who can not completely afford the funding of the trip.

    Other Ways You Can Help!  Spread the word about our campaign and help raise awareness for rhinos. Tell everybody that you can! 
If you have any other ideas we could use for raising funds let us know in the comments.",1.0,0,"2 Campaigns

In Calgary 1 out of 12 jobs are in the fossil fuel industry. Not surprisingly Calgary is seen as the Cowboy oil and gas centre of Canada. But, did you know that:

The C-Train system is wind powered? 


Since 2009 city-wide recycling grew 71%?                       That's 208 Million Kgs less in the landfill!


There are 2,000 community gardens in the City?

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Patrick Clark, I am 17 years old and I am a Boy Scout in Troop 180. I am currently the rank of Life Scout, and to become the rank of Eagle Scout I need to complete an Eagle Scout Project. An Eagle Scout Project is usually a community service project that is planned and organized by the scout. The project that I have planned will be the reconstruction of a class garden at a local elementary school. This campaign is to raise the funds so that I can complete my project and become an Eagle Scout.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>For my project we will need around $500. The funding goes to project materials, such as the PVC we will be laying down, the planters we will be adding, the hoses we will be replacing, and other materials of that nature. Some of the funding will also go to food and water for everyone that will be helping me do the project, since it is expected to take most of the weekend.</p>
<p>After the project is finished, there will be some sort of commemorative sign or plaque put on site, to recognize everyone who helped. Everyone who donates will be recognized.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project will not only help me but it will help the community as well. Since the garden is located at a school, the students will be able to learn about gardening, the plants and the environment. </p>

<h1><strong>Dog Talkie – Our Story</strong></h1>

<p><br/><strong>Dog Talkie</strong> is an iPad and iPhone app that allows dogs to communicate their wants and desires with their human companions.  Dogs ""nose touch"" the pictures on the iPad screen with the activity they are interested in, and Dog Talkie will do the rest.  You and your dog will then hear in English and other languages what the dog has communicated.  It will even send you a <strong>doggie text message</strong> to your iPhone (very nice when your dog absolutely has to go outside right now!)  Imagine fussing around in the kitchen or in the garage, when you get a text on your iPhone that your dog is requesting a walk.  Wow!</p>
<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/427862/pictures/full/20120906221327-Cell.jpg?1346994834"" src="""" style=""""/><h1><strong>How we came up with Dog Talkie</strong></h1>
<p>My name is David Kahan, founder of <a href=""http://www.azymous.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Azymous Interactive</a>, husband, father, and imperial servant to two little dachshunds named Ashley and Willow.  We also care for Molly, my parents rescue dachshund. </p>
<p>One thing one learns very quickly with having dogs in the family is just how extraordinarily intelligent they are. Many of you may have heard that recent studies have shown some dogs can understand vocabularies of several hundred words, and have intelligence comparable to a 2 year old human child.</p>

<p>One evening, while surfing the internet on the iPad, little Willow sauntered over to say hello, and touched the iPad screen with her nose, triggering the web browser to play a video.  Light bulbs went off…<strong><em>Hey, if dogs can touch their nose on the iPad and trigger events, why not design an app to help them communicate with us?</em></strong> </p>
<p>Thinking further on this, I remembered many years ago seeing a tv show about <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiWDKXRzSmU"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lana the Chimpanzee</a>, who in the 1970’s communicated with people via Emory Universities' symbolic language <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerkish"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Yerkish</a>. To communicate, Lana would touch pictures of the appropriate Yerkish symbol on what was then a modern computer screen. Well, if Lana the chimp can communicate by touching pictures, I bet our dogs can as well!  And so Azymous Interactive set out to engineer a tablet based app that would facilitate canine to human communications.</p>
<h1>Dog Vision</h1>
<p>Dogs do not see the same as we do, and it would not do any good for Dog Talkie to display graphics for dogs if they could not see them clearly. Dogs do in fact see colors, but differently then we do, with less detail and muted clarity.  One wonderful tool we found was on <a href=""http://www.dog-vision.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Andras Peter’s Dog Vision website</a>, which is very helpful for looking at graphics from a dogs point of view. </p>
<p>For example, the <em><strong>human view</strong></em> of our prototype screen for Dog Talkie looks as follows…</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/427859/pictures/full/20120906221258-HumanView.jpg?1346994782"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><strong><em>                  While most dogs will see the screen as follows…</em></strong></p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/427858/pictures/full/20120906221238-DogView.png?1346994780"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>The <strong><em>""Treat""</em></strong>, <em><strong>""Outside""</strong></em>, and <em>""<strong>Affection""</strong></em> graphics provide reasonable contrast, while the <em><strong>""Play""</strong></em> graphic in the top right corner could use improvement.  We will be working on providing as clear as possible graphics from the canine point of view for the released product.</p>
<h1><strong><em>OK, what happens when a dog’s nose touches a Dog Talkie graphic?</em></strong></h1>
<p>First a voice file is played, clearly stating what the touched graphic symbolizes, such as <strong><em>“Let's Play”</em></strong> or <strong><em>“Go Outside”</em></strong>. Playing the voice response is very important, as it both reinforces for the dog what has been selected and lets nearby humans know as well.</p>
<p>After playing the voice file, Dog Talkie, depending upon its configuration, will send a doggie text message their companions iPhone, such as <em>“<strong>I need to go outside!” </strong></em>or<em><strong> ""I'm lonely, let's play!""</strong></em> </p>
<p>When we first tested the prototype, some dogs would ""nose touch"" the graphics two or three times in a row, causing repetitive responses.  We subsequently reprogrammed the graphics code to ignore additional touches for few seconds, preventing these inadvertent ""multi-nose"" touches.</p>
<h1><strong>The most important things...</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Dog Talkie</strong> is a lot of fun for both you and your dog. A little patience and interaction will give your dogs a wonderful experience and an enhanced ability to communicate with their human companions.</p>
<p><em>Azymous Interactive will be donating 10% of <strong>all</strong> proceeds from Dog Talkie sales to <strong>Franklin's Friends</strong>, a wonderful animal welfare group that benefits the <strong>SPCA of Central Florida</strong>. Every single copy of Dog Talkie sold will benefit homeless dogs and other animals, and that really motivates us</em>!</p>

</div></div>","Dog Talkie – Our Story

Dog Talkie is an iPad and iPhone app that allows dogs to communicate their wants and desires with their human companions.  Dogs ""nose touch"" the pictures on the iPad screen with the activity they are interested in, and Dog Talkie will do the rest.  You and your dog will then hear in English and other languages what the dog has communicated.  It will even send you a doggie text message to your iPhone (very nice when your dog absolutely has to go outside right now!)  Imagine fussing around in the kitchen or in the garage, when you get a text on your iPhone that your dog is requesting a walk.  Wow!
How we came up with Dog Talkie
My name is David Kahan, founder of Azymous Interactive, husband, father, and imperial servant to two little dachshunds named Ashley and Willow.  We also care for Molly, my parents rescue dachshund. 
One thing one learns very quickly with having dogs in the family is just how extraordinarily intelligent they are. Many of you may have heard that recent studies have shown some dogs can understand vocabularies of several hundred words, and have intelligence comparable to a 2 year old human child.

One evening, while surfing the internet on the iPad, little Willow sauntered over to say hello, and touched the iPad screen with her nose, triggering the web browser to play a video.  Light bulbs went off…Hey, if dogs can touch their nose on the iPad and trigger events, why not design an app to help them communicate with us? 
Thinking further on this, I remembered many years ago seeing a tv show about Lana the Chimpanzee, who in the 1970’s communicated with people via Emory Universities' symbolic language Yerkish. To communicate, Lana would touch pictures of the appropriate Yerkish symbol on what was then a modern computer screen. Well, if Lana the chimp can communicate by touching pictures, I bet our dogs can as well!  And so Azymous Interactive set out to engineer a tablet based app that would facilitate canine to human communications.
Dog Vision
Dogs do not see the same as we do, and it would not do any good for Dog Talkie to display graphics for dogs if they could not see them clearly. Dogs do in fact see colors, but differently then we do, with less detail and muted clarity.  One wonderful tool we found was on Andras Peter’s Dog Vision website, which is very helpful for looking at graphics from a dogs point of view. 
For example, the human view of our prototype screen for Dog Talkie looks as follows…

                  While most dogs will see the screen as follows…

The ""Treat"", ""Outside"", and ""Affection"" graphics provide reasonable contrast, while the ""Play"" graphic in the top right corner could use improvement.  We will be working on providing as clear as possible graphics from the canine point of view for the released product.
OK, what happens when a dog’s nose touches a Dog Talkie graphic?
First a voice file is played, clearly stating what the touched graphic symbolizes, such as “Let's Play” or “Go Outside”. Playing the voice response is very important, as it both reinforces for the dog what has been selected and lets nearby humans know as well.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My close and personal friend, Mike, and I began hiking in the <span class=""yshortcuts"" id=""lw_1298597217_4"">Brooks Range</span> in 2007 when we both landed seasonal work in Coldfoot, AK.  Coldfoot is a small truck stop North of the Arctic Circle on the lifeline between <span class=""yshortcuts"" id=""lw_1298597217_5"">Fairbanks</span> and Prudhoe Bay, the <span class=""yshortcuts"" id=""lw_1298597217_6"">Dalton Highway</span>. A summer full of short three- and four-day trips culminated with a 12-day trip into the <span class=""yshortcuts"" id=""lw_1298597217_7"">Gates of the Arctic National Park</span>. We finished during the first week of October, and had not seen a temperature above freezing the entire time. As the ice formed and the season ended we were made aware of the immense respect this indomitable land required of its visitors. We returned the next spring, in early 2008, <br/></p>
<p>My close and personal friend, Hyme, and I thus began our annual summer backpack hikes through the Brooks Range.  We chose to start from the West, where the Brooks Range first emerges out of the ocean.    Summer 2008 began on a 50ft strip of hard ground between Iliad Lagoon and the Chuckse Sea 70 miles above the arctic circle.  We walked, swam and crawled east for 40 days and about 200 miles.  Northwest of the village of Ambler a rock smashed Hyme's middle-left toe, our hike ended and amended my hiking partner's name to Hyme-9 Toes.  Summer 2009 we flew into Ambler and hiked approximately 100 miles to the Reed River. Summer 2010, we parked the support vehchle at Galbraith Lake and hiked to the Sagavanirktok River headwaters east  of the Dalton Highway along the western edge of America's largest wildlife refuge.  ANWR.<br/></p>
<p>As the miles beneath our boots accumulated through the Brooks Range, our most commonly shared sentiment was respect.  A deep and serious respect for perpetual time and the truely wild. <br/></p>

<p>Transportation in the remote Brooks Range, especially ANWR, is costly and our backpacks in the past have weighed a crippling 87lbs.  We need funds for an Alaskan Bush pilot to drop us off near the Alaska/Yukon Border and make two food drops between the International Border and the Dalton.  </p>
<p>Dehydrated foods, energy bars and peanut butter are costly.  Even though funds raised for this journey are for transportation, we must give a shout-out to CORE Foods.  <span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: times, serif; font-size: 16px;""><span class=""yshortcuts"" id=""lw_1306681573_1"">CORE products will be in the backpacks.  We are impressed with the quality of ingredients and the essential nutritional value CORE bars provide.  A big healthy ""Thanks!"" to the team at CORE for their support!  </span> </span>     </p>
<br/>The only electronic devices we carry are two Spots and two cameras.  The Spot is a small orange box, about the size of a deck of cards, with four buttons and a little blinking light.  When activated, the Spot emails our current coordinate location to receivers. The Spot can also be used as an emergency beacon.  It has never failed us. We would be honored if you were a receiver of our Spot messages, enabling you to track our progress on a map at home.  Allow yourself, friends and family to experience a real life- real time- slice of adventure, adventure into the wild.    <br/><div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""border-collapse: separate; font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 16px;""> </span></div>

</div></div>","Our Story
My close and personal friend, Mike, and I began hiking in the Brooks Range in 2007 when we both landed seasonal work in Coldfoot, AK.  Coldfoot is a small truck stop North of the Arctic Circle on the lifeline between Fairbanks and Prudhoe Bay, the Dalton Highway. A summer full of short three- and four-day trips culminated with a 12-day trip into the Gates of the Arctic National Park. We finished during the first week of October, and had not seen a temperature above freezing the entire time. As the ice formed and the season ended we were made aware of the immense respect this indomitable land required of its visitors. We returned the next spring, in early 2008, 
My close and personal friend, Hyme, and I thus began our annual summer backpack hikes through the Brooks Range.  We chose to start from the West, where the Brooks Range first emerges out of the ocean.    Summer 2008 began on a 50ft strip of hard ground between Iliad Lagoon and the Chuckse Sea 70 miles above the arctic circle.  We walked, swam and crawled east for 40 days and about 200 miles.  Northwest of the village of Ambler a rock smashed Hyme's middle-left toe, our hike ended and amended my hiking partner's name to Hyme-9 Toes.  Summer 2009 we flew into Ambler and hiked approximately 100 miles to the Reed River. Summer 2010, we parked the support vehchle at Galbraith Lake and hiked to the Sagavanirktok River headwaters east  of the Dalton Highway along the western edge of America's largest wildlife refuge.  ANWR.
As the miles beneath our boots accumulated through the Brooks Range, our most commonly shared sentiment was respect.  A deep and serious respect for perpetual time and the truely wild. 


We are walking across ANWR to confirm why ANWR should always remain a quiet place without human control.  We believe humans should be visitors and guardians of ANWR for our benefit and enjoyment and a bequest to the future generations.  
 
      
Mike

Mike is a North American tour guide (guide name is Shaggy) and is currently guiding small groups on cross-country camping/lodging tours across the United States and trekking Zion, Big Bend, Grand Canyon, Bryce, Joshua Tree National parks  He shows travelers the magnificense of the North American landscape as well as the great diversity of North American cities.  Mike can be found somewhere between Manhattan, NY, and Venice Beach, CA.

Hyme-9 Toes
Hyme-9 is currently volunteering for his second conservation corps, this time in Nevada. He maintains and beautifies public lands.  His first stint with the conservation corps was 2006 in the Pacific Northwestern region of the United States maintaining King County trails and eradicating (battling) feral blackberry thickets.  Hyme-9 is working in the deserts of the American Southwest and can be found within 500 miles of Winnimuca, Nevada.
Both men are high ranking members of the Ancient and Honorable Order of E. Clampus Vitus.
Journey Well Hobos!

We are working hard for this journey.  Every dollar earned is going to this expedition.    It will happen- ANWR or Bust.  We practice excellent hiking ethics and honor the earth.


What We Need & What You Get



Transportation in the remote Brooks Range, especially ANWR, is costly and our backpacks in the past have weighed a crippling 87lbs.  We need funds for an Alaskan Bush pilot to drop us off near the Alaska/Yukon Border and make two food drops between the International Border and the Dalton.  
Dehydrated foods, energy bars and peanut butter are costly.  Even though funds raised for this journey are for transportation, we must give a shout-out to CORE Foods.  CORE products will be in the backpacks.  We are impressed with the quality of ingredients and the essential nutritional value CORE bars provide.  A big healthy ""Thanks!"" to the team at CORE for their support!        
The only electronic devices we carry are two Spots and two cameras.  The Spot is a small orange box, about the size of a deck of cards, with four buttons and a little blinking light.  When activated, the Spot emails our current coordinate location to receivers. The Spot can also be used as an emergency beacon.  It has never failed us. We would be honored if you were a receiver of our Spot messages, enabling you to track our progress on a map at home.  Allow yourself, friends and family to experience a real life- real time- slice of adventure, adventure into the wild.     
The Impact

A dream of ours is to see Arctic National Wildlife Refuge evolve into Arctic National Park.  National Park status would place even stricter restrictions on the future development of this pristine environment.  First, we must make the uniqueness of ANWR known.  ANWR is the last truely wild area protected by law.   As guests walking across this last remaining wilderness, a true passion the wild and all that entails is paramount to a successful journey.  ANWR should not spoil due to the tempoary needs of a tempory generation.  Through video, photographs and eye witness accounts we will offer a multi-media testimony to the power of wilderness and evidence for it's preservation.

<h3>Hi Friends</h3>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">   I</span><span style="""">'m Aron D, many of you  already know me but for those who don't, I'm worthy of this good cause. Yes, this is a first world problem, my budget, my accountant and my girlfriend all cannot justify the cost of the car I have a crush on, and already own a perfectly reliable 2005 Toyota Camry.... BUT I believe dreams can come true, and I'm sure many of you have dreamt of that car you would love to own and will help buy mine. </span><br/></p>
<p>   All I need is $100 from 690 people, I have 500 friends on Facebook, besides birthday greetings once a year on my Facebook wall, how about $100 just this once! :D </p>
<p>For those people visiting from the FJ Cruiser Forums, $100 is less than the cost of a tank of petrol but 690 people donating this could allow me to be a member of this esteemed forum which I have been checking out since July 2011 back when Australia had a 6 month wait for supply of a FJ Cruiser. (I went to place an order but finance knocked me back!)</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So why do I need $69000 for a car that car that sells for $45,990? Accessories, my friends, accessories! </p>
<p>For those who have been to a new car dealer, we all know that those accessories  can add up pretty quick. And this is a 4wd I'm talking about. You can't have a 4wd without roof racks for the petrol jerry cans, floor mats for those muddy camping trips, rock rails, well rock rails are self explanatory but for those who don't know, they help protect the underbody of the car. And that's just the beginning of the accessories list, tow bar, nudge bar also known as the roo bar down under in Australia.. Snorkel to help the Fj cruise tread deeper water, 2"" lift and shocks for better ground clearance and the list goes on!</p>
<p><span style="""">As I'm not looking for a free ride, that's what your donation will buy you, a free ride in my  4wd. Donations under $50 will earn a quick ride in my car, donations of $50-$100 will  allow you to test drive my car, anything over $100 will allow you to go off-roading with me. Donate $1000 or more for a full off roading weekend getaway including have a turn driving on the 4wd trails. </span></p>
<p><span style="""">If I don’t reach my entire goal, I will simply use the raised funds as a deposit for the car and finance the remainder of my balance.....  oh and  also flowers and an 'I love you' card for one upset girlfriend who says my hard earned money shouldn't be spent on financing a  sixty thousand dollar car (with accessories) but should be spent on my son, even though I know he would much prefer going camping and fishing in one cool Tonka Truck, just look at that picture, this is one sexy car!</span></p>

<h3>Land Energy Clearing</h3>
<p>I am a Wellingtonian, born and bred. I love this city, especially the energy our ""windy"" weather brings. One of the great things about Wellington is that negative energy doesn't stick around. It's not only that the wind won't let it. The people here are not destined to be stuck in one place either. <br/></p>
<p>During the earthquakes in Wellington, July 2013, it was not only the physical structure that took a hit. The land energy started to shed its negativity. In a behavior that looked very similar to liquefaction, the land poured out a black energy of past pains. <br/></p>
<p>It is the belief of many that this land was once part of Lemuria. The downfall of Lemuria was energetically vicious. Many of those we work with have past life memories of this time. The consciousness of the civilization was infected with the intention to lower self worth and increase destructive behavior. <br/></p>
<p>This is what we started to see exhibiting in the behavior of Wellingtonians post earthquake. <br/></p>
<p>We have been asked by those we work with to clear the land on a deeper level than the normal meditation that most practitioners do each day. </p>
<p>What we feel will help most is to clear quartz crystals and program them to lift and clear the land and group consciousness of the greater Wellington region. <br/></p>
<p>We will start this with 70 crystals in high density areas. <br/></p>
<p>Each crystal will be highly charged and Programed. We will then send energy to them each day. We will also be hold regular groups to send energy to them and clear the energy of Wellington over the next year. <br/></p>
<p>Our time will be gifted in service to the process and to Wellington, however we are unable to cover the cost of the crystals.<br/></p>If you can financially support, even a small amount, please give what you can. If you want to join us in the meditations, please add me on Facebook or visit Wisdomtrader.co.nz for details. <br/><p></p>

<p>The Foundation for IT Sustainability (FFITS.ORG) is a global, non-profit organisation established in 2008 whose mission is to engage with, and educate individuals, government and corporations on the environmental footprint of technology, as well as promote the sustainable use of technology to help solve environmental problems.</p>
<p>Our largest awareness campaign was launched in 2010 and has fast become the world’s largest Virtual Green IT event: International Green IT Awareness Week (IGITAW) in 2010.</p>
<p>IGITAW (<a href=""http://www.greenitweek.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.greenitweek.org</a>) runs from the 1 - 7 June each year and brings together the global network of Green IT professionals, including thousands of tech journalists, CIOs, CTOs, IT Managers, sustainability professionals, carbon managers and more under one virtual roof. IGITAW comprises of over 30 live and pre-recorded tactical and practical learning sessions, international keynotes, Q&amp;A panels and more.</p>
<p>During this week our panel of leading international speakers will present a series of engaging, pragmatic and thought-provoking conference-style presentations. The aim of the presentations will be to equip attendees with a range of skills and the knowledge necessary to take action on Green IT, however big or small.</p>
<p>As a 24 hour global virtual conference, attendees of IGITAW can learn from the world’s leading Green IT experts, network, chat directly with other attendees, speakers and sponsors in the comfort of their own home or office.</p>
<p>The week of education and action was developed to encourage individuals and organisations to demand more from themselves and their partners, holding each other to account for our impact on the environment. The initiative also aims to encourage those individuals and organisations to bring together their CIO, IT Directors along with their business managers, CFO and COE’s to start the discussion around what their organisation can do to green their IT infrastructure.</p>
<h2><strong>What We Need</strong></h2>
<p>To assist with building the awareness of IGITAW we need your financial support to help us reach more individuals and organisations across the globe through the development of educational and motivational multimedia campaigns (similar to ‘Our Vision’ video above), social media initiatives, advertidsing campaigns and global press engagement. <br/><br/> FFITS.ORG relies on generous financial supporters to continue our important work in building awareness of Green IT issues, and with your help we can continue to spread the message across the globe and to remain the largest Green IT conference in the world!</p>
<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p>The production of empowering and inspirational multimedia is a proven method of building rapid global awareness on an issue. Mobile marketing, live casting and podcasting, and sharing of photos and videos, can spread the word about our campaign and help us build awareness in very unique and powerful ways. Our particular type of social media marketing will also provide us with the potential to go viral quickly.</p>

<p> </p></div>","Short Summary
The Foundation for IT Sustainability (FFITS.ORG) is a global, non-profit organisation established in 2008 whose mission is to engage with, and educate individuals, government and corporations on the environmental footprint of technology, as well as promote the sustainable use of technology to help solve environmental problems.
Our largest awareness campaign was launched in 2010 and has fast become the world’s largest Virtual Green IT event: International Green IT Awareness Week (IGITAW) in 2010.
IGITAW (www.greenitweek.org) runs from the 1 - 7 June each year and brings together the global network of Green IT professionals, including thousands of tech journalists, CIOs, CTOs, IT Managers, sustainability professionals, carbon managers and more under one virtual roof. IGITAW comprises of over 30 live and pre-recorded tactical and practical learning sessions, international keynotes, Q&A panels and more.
During this week our panel of leading international speakers will present a series of engaging, pragmatic and thought-provoking conference-style presentations. The aim of the presentations will be to equip attendees with a range of skills and the knowledge necessary to take action on Green IT, however big or small.
As a 24 hour global virtual conference, attendees of IGITAW can learn from the world’s leading Green IT experts, network, chat directly with other attendees, speakers and sponsors in the comfort of their own home or office.
The week of education and action was developed to encourage individuals and organisations to demand more from themselves and their partners, holding each other to account for our impact on the environment. The initiative also aims to encourage those individuals and organisations to bring together their CIO, IT Directors along with their business managers, CFO and COE’s to start the discussion around what their organisation can do to green their IT infrastructure.

<h3>Welcome!</h3>
<p>Thank you for stopping by, and for taking an interest in our dream!  This project is the brainchild of wayward explorers, passionate educators, writers, and photographers who have traveled 15,000 kilometers by human-power across three continents, and now need your help to put the last and largest piece of an around-the-world journey into place.</p>
<p>Take a look around, head over to the website, and, if you can, take a minute to offer your support.</p>
<p>Please, whether or not you can spare a few dollars to help us make it to the Pacific, share this page on Facebook, Twitter, and by e-mail.  Text your friends.  E-mail your dentist.  Tell... everybody.  Spread the fire, and you can help make our dream a reality!</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>Our route begins in central Mongolia, on the edge of the vast endorheic basin of Central Asia, where rivers disappear into deserts and dying seas. We will travel by canoe through the canyons of the Chuluut into the rushing waters of the Ider, to the major flow of the Selenge, to Baikal, the biggest lake by volume on Earth. From there, we will move into the Amur watershed, moving east towards the Sea of Okhotsk. Human-powered expedition travel is our means, canoes are our craft, and our goal is to move across the land in the best style possible, gathering stories as we go to share with those unable to visit this last, best place, and perhaps inspire them to further river conservation there and at home.</p>
<p>We will travel by canoe through a landscape of superlatives: towering peaks, endless steppe, the largest forest and largest lake on Earth, through whitewater canyons and past peaceful wooden villages set on crumbling riverbanks.  It'll take four months of constant human-powered travel to make the route, but that is just the start of our journey.</p>
<p><strong>The Bigger Picture</strong></p>
<p>We want to tell stories.  We want to tell the story of this journey to lend an inspiring voice to conservation and education efforts, and we want to tell it in as many different forms as possible.  Young people need stories to inspire them to think about natural resources, and to move from in front of the screen to the out-of-doors.  The world's rivers - ""...the chords that bind the world together."" - are in danger today as never before.  Energy exploration, climate change, hydroelectic development, antiquated management practices, and population growth all threaten these key resources; we know in our hearts that an untamed and undeveloped river flowing through wilderness holds incredible power, and is worth exploring, and worth protecting.</p>
<p>The distant watersheds this expedition will traverse and the high style this team plans to  use helps set this journey apart.  While the Asia River Expedition stands alone, it does continue a theme first set out four years ago when Zand Martin set off from Portland, OR to paddle across North America.  Since then, he has moved east 15,000 kilometers across three continents, and if successful, this project will bring him back to where he began: the Pacific Ocean.  </p>

<h2>CHANGE OF PERKS: TO SHOW MY GRATITUDE <em>EVERY DONOR</em> WILL GET THEIR NAME ON THE TUK TUK! </h2>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2>
<strong>An exploration of the environmental and cultural  impacts of a global world on</strong><strong> Central and South America, </strong><strong>in a tuk tuk.</strong>
</h2>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>The Idea<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i848.photobucket.com/albums/ab50/MrMarris/P1010601_zps3e5a3be8.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin: 5px; float: right;""/></strong></h3>
<p>In terms of both cultural and biological diversity, Central and South America are at the top of the list.  However, these amazing people and the beautiful places are under threat.  We've all seen the headlines - deforestation for cattle, indigenous communities threatened, rivers polluted and running dry.   But we never get to see the full stories.  </p>
<p>I want to tell the 'what happened nexts?' and the stories of the people, communities and projects seeking to protect and improve the natural environment.  I will be capturing images and creating short documentaries to tell these tales. </p>
<p>I have been volunteering in Guatemala working with rural farmers for the last three months, learning about their lives, hardships and opportunities.  I want to continue hearing these stories and telling them to the world to raise awareness, and hope!</p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>The Vehicle</strong></h3>
<p>It would be very easy to travel in a four-wheeled, air conditioned bubble, a nice reliable, weather proof vehicle.  One with space for luggage and maybe even a bed.  But this bubble wouldn’t leave much opportunity for interaction with the landscape and their people. </p>
<p>I am forgoing the comfort of the aforementioned bubble in favor of something a bit more open.  I am trading in one of the wheels and the luggage room for space for a couple of passengers.   I am swapping the weather-proofness and security of doors and a solid roof in favor of the chance to connect with more people.  And I am swapping the air conditioning and powerful engine for a 8.5 bhp 0.17 l engine. I will be travelling by tuk tuk, a slow and ridiculous vehicle.  </p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>The Driver/Story Teller<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i848.photobucket.com/albums/ab50/MrMarris/IMG_2887_zpsd67160dc.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></strong></h3>
<p><br/>That'll be me (the one with glasses in the photo).  I am Matthew Harris.  I am a conservationist and soil scientist by training and photographer and videographer by passion.  I have a keen interest in environmental sustainability and the part food production plays in this.  I am currently based in Guatemala volunteering with <a href=""http://www.semillanueva.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Semilla Nueva</a>, a sustainable agriculture NGO.  You can check out some of my work about their work <a href=""http://vimeo.com/64926328"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, <a href=""http://vimeo.com/64088847"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a> and <a href=""http://vimeo.com/63852822"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. </p>
<p>Working with Semila Nueva has given me a glimpse of some of the issues that are felt by small scale-farmers in Guatemala and no doubt echoed around the world.  I am eager to find out more about where food comes from, and explore what farming and the environment mean to different people. </p>
</div>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>The Route<br/></strong></h3>
<p>I want to keep this project focused on the journey rather than the destination so my route is not going to be set in stone.  I know that I want to go South(ish), and I will stay of the Pan American Highway as much as possible.  Inevitable, I am going to get lost and I am going to be detouring all over the place in order to tell interesting and inspiring stories of people making a difference to farming and the environment. </p>
<p>If you're considering choosing someone for me to serenade from my tuk tuk, or suggesting a place to visit, please stick to Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicoragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Paraguy, Chilie or Argentina as these are coutries I'll feasably (or maybe infeasably, considering the vehicle) be able to get to.  </p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">The Impact</h3>
<p>Central and South America are among the most cultural and environmentally places on the planet.  However, it is under threat on a range of fronts - Global warming threatens both the crops of small farmer well as the balance of unique ecosystems.  Unfair land distribution endangers the lively hoods of local people and leads to previously untouched areas to be turned over to agriculture, the list continues.</p>
<p>However, there are also infinite untold positive stories of environmental protection and stewardship.  It is <em>so</em> important for these stories to be told.  For the people involved, knowing that people are interested, that people care about their plight is such an important thing and will help people carry on the good they are doing.  Add to this the awareness that will be raised back where you guys are from, the potential for exerting political and social pressure to bring positive changes is real and enormous too.  </p>
<h2 style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>How Your Money Will be Spent:<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i848.photobucket.com/albums/ab50/MrMarris/mods_zps29555108.png"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 3px;""/><br/></strong></h2>
<p>First off, I'm going to need <strong>a tuk tuk</strong></p>
<p>The tuk tuk will need <strong>a few modifications. </strong> I’m going to add a roof rack and some extra storage so I have room for passengers along the way.  </p>
<p>I will also add a <strong>sound system</strong> (a little more reserved than that illustration suggests however!) to keep me bopping/along the way.  </p>
<p>As fuel efficient as tuk tuks are, they still need <strong>fuel.</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest obstacle on this route will be <strong>getting round the Darien Gap.  </strong>This is the 70 mile stretch between Panama and Columbia where there’s no road.  Instead, there’s thick jungle, guerrilla fighters and drug runners!   The tuk tuk and I will need to get on a boat and sail from to South America.</p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">What<strong> you get in return</strong> </h3>
<p>I will be creating a series of photo stories and short videos telling the tales of the people I meet along the way and the places I visit.  So in addition to the perks, you will get to watch and learn about the lives of all sorts of folk in Central and South America. </p>
<p>I am turning to the crowd sourcing community for help funding this project as I would much rather have a tuk tuk adorned with your motifs and messages rather than those of corporate sponsors.  Although, if there are any like minded businesses that are interested in supporting me I would love to hear from you.</p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Another way of thinking about your donations:</h3>
<p>A tuk tuk does about 60 mpg (or 25 km per l or 100 km per gallon or 4 l per 100 km) at about 20 mph.  So, with the price of petrol at about $5 a gallon in Central and South America.  Every $10 donation will see me fuelled for nearly 7 hours of driving! And even going 25 mph in my tuk tuk, that’ll still get me 175 miles! </p>
<p>That’s like, from New York to Baltimore.  Or Los Angeles to Mexico. Or Bristol to Snowdonia.  Or from the Caribbean Sea to the Pacific Ocean in Costa Rica.  For $10!  Now that’s value for generosity! </p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Perks</h3>
<p>My goal is to have a tuk tuk covered in all of your lovely names rather than the stickers of a couple of big sponsers so everyone who donates $25 (thats a mere £16.50 for my british <span>compatriots</span>) or more will have their name painted on the tuk tuk.  And whenever your name is in a picture on facebook, I'll do my best to tag you.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>I've put the delivery date as the very latest date they could posibly be, you can expect your perks much sooner, I just don't want to dissapoint!</em></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em> </em></p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t want to donate with money I’d love it if you could <strong>donate nice words</strong> on the comments up the top and with <strong>like/shares</strong> on/of the <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/tuktuktales"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">facebook page</a>.  The more popular Indiegogo think we are, the more likely we’ll make the front page and cool things like that. </p>
<p>If you're a music maker, I'd love to here from you - every good story needs good music!</p>

In terms of both cultural and biological diversity, Central and South America are at the top of the list.  However, these amazing people and the beautiful places are under threat.  We've all seen the headlines - deforestation for cattle, indigenous communities threatened, rivers polluted and running dry.   But we never get to see the full stories.  
I want to tell the 'what happened nexts?' and the stories of the people, communities and projects seeking to protect and improve the natural environment.  I will be capturing images and creating short documentaries to tell these tales. 
I have been volunteering in Guatemala working with rural farmers for the last three months, learning about their lives, hardships and opportunities.  I want to continue hearing these stories and telling them to the world to raise awareness, and hope!
The Vehicle
It would be very easy to travel in a four-wheeled, air conditioned bubble, a nice reliable, weather proof vehicle.  One with space for luggage and maybe even a bed.  But this bubble wouldn’t leave much opportunity for interaction with the landscape and their people. 
I am forgoing the comfort of the aforementioned bubble in favor of something a bit more open.  I am trading in one of the wheels and the luggage room for space for a couple of passengers.   I am swapping the weather-proofness and security of doors and a solid roof in favor of the chance to connect with more people.  And I am swapping the air conditioning and powerful engine for a 8.5 bhp 0.17 l engine. I will be travelling by tuk tuk, a slow and ridiculous vehicle.  
The Driver/Story Teller
That'll be me (the one with glasses in the photo).  I am Matthew Harris.  I am a conservationist and soil scientist by training and photographer and videographer by passion.  I have a keen interest in environmental sustainability and the part food production plays in this.  I am currently based in Guatemala volunteering with Semilla Nueva, a sustainable agriculture NGO.  You can check out some of my work about their work here, here and here. 
Working with Semila Nueva has given me a glimpse of some of the issues that are felt by small scale-farmers in Guatemala and no doubt echoed around the world.  I am eager to find out more about where food comes from, and explore what farming and the environment mean to different people. 

The Route
I want to keep this project focused on the journey rather than the destination so my route is not going to be set in stone.  I know that I want to go South(ish), and I will stay of the Pan American Highway as much as possible.  Inevitable, I am going to get lost and I am going to be detouring all over the place in order to tell interesting and inspiring stories of people making a difference to farming and the environment. 
If you're considering choosing someone for me to serenade from my tuk tuk, or suggesting a place to visit, please stick to Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicoragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Paraguy, Chilie or Argentina as these are coutries I'll feasably (or maybe infeasably, considering the vehicle) be able to get to.  
The Impact
Central and South America are among the most cultural and environmentally places on the planet.  However, it is under threat on a range of fronts - Global warming threatens both the crops of small farmer well as the balance of unique ecosystems.  Unfair land distribution endangers the lively hoods of local people and leads to previously untouched areas to be turned over to agriculture, the list continues.
However, there are also infinite untold positive stories of environmental protection and stewardship.  It is so important for these stories to be told.  For the people involved, knowing that people are interested, that people care about their plight is such an important thing and will help people carry on the good they are doing.  Add to this the awareness that will be raised back where you guys are from, the potential for exerting political and social pressure to bring positive changes is real and enormous too.  
How Your Money Will be Spent:
First off, I'm going to need a tuk tuk
The tuk tuk will need a few modifications.  I’m going to add a roof rack and some extra storage so I have room for passengers along the way.  
I will also add a sound system (a little more reserved than that illustration suggests however!) to keep me bopping/along the way.  
As fuel efficient as tuk tuks are, they still need fuel.
Perhaps the biggest obstacle on this route will be getting round the Darien Gap.  This is the 70 mile stretch between Panama and Columbia where there’s no road.  Instead, there’s thick jungle, guerrilla fighters and drug runners!   The tuk tuk and I will need to get on a boat and sail from to South America.
What you get in return 
I will be creating a series of photo stories and short videos telling the tales of the people I meet along the way and the places I visit.  So in addition to the perks, you will get to watch and learn about the lives of all sorts of folk in Central and South America. 
I am turning to the crowd sourcing community for help funding this project as I would much rather have a tuk tuk adorned with your motifs and messages rather than those of corporate sponsors.  Although, if there are any like minded businesses that are interested in supporting me I would love to hear from you.
Another way of thinking about your donations:
A tuk tuk does about 60 mpg (or 25 km per l or 100 km per gallon or 4 l per 100 km) at about 20 mph.  So, with the price of petrol at about $5 a gallon in Central and South America.  Every $10 donation will see me fuelled for nearly 7 hours of driving! And even going 25 mph in my tuk tuk, that’ll still get me 175 miles! 
That’s like, from New York to Baltimore.  Or Los Angeles to Mexico. Or Bristol to Snowdonia.  Or from the Caribbean Sea to the Pacific Ocean in Costa Rica.  For $10!  Now that’s value for generosity! 
Perks
My goal is to have a tuk tuk covered in all of your lovely names rather than the stickers of a couple of big sponsers so everyone who donates $25 (thats a mere £16.50 for my british compatriots) or more will have their name painted on the tuk tuk.  And whenever your name is in a picture on facebook, I'll do my best to tag you.  
 
I've put the delivery date as the very latest date they could posibly be, you can expect your perks much sooner, I just don't want to dissapoint!
 
Other Ways You Can Help
If you don’t want to donate with money I’d love it if you could donate nice words on the comments up the top and with like/shares on/of the facebook page.  The more popular Indiegogo think we are, the more likely we’ll make the front page and cool things like that. 
If you're a music maker, I'd love to here from you - every good story needs good music!

</div></div>","We Did It!  The Localize This! Great Lakes Basin Action Camp was a huge success, and...  WE DID NOT TURN ANYONE AWAY FOR LACK OF FUNDS - AND - we assisted with travel.  The result of that is that Backbone Campaign is short $6,000 for this effort and we need your help to make sure we can keep providing these movement building opportunities in the future.Camp was AMAZING!  We replicated our Pacific NW Localize This! Action Camp model and 
produced an extremely successful week long training camp in the Great 
Lakes Basin.  Sixty activists, organizers and trainers worked intensely 
together to share skills, develop common practices, and evolve a shared 
lexicon for harmonizing the work of change agents working in many 
environmental and economic justice movements. These front line activists took time away from work, family, and the causes that they work on passionately to deepen their capacity and broaden their alliances. We closed with a strategic and timely action at the Michigan Capitol in Lansing to expose a corporate sponsored trojan horse bill to redefine industrial waste (including petroleum coke from tar sands oil) as a renewable energy! But these camps do not NOT pay for themselves.  We need YOU to pitch in to make sure Backbone Campaign & Circle Pines Center can do this again next year.   THANK YOU!

<p>Fuel and toll costs to cover the circa 6.000 km roundtrip from Faro to Gerlos (crossing Spain, France and Switzerland until Austria) and the exploratory travels throughout Tirol in 3 months that can sum 1.000 km will amount to 800€.</p>
<p><i>The riding and exploration</i></p>
<p>The pass for mechanical lifts to access the Tirolean summits and slopes costs 737€. A standard insurance for mountain sports for the duration of the trip costs 160€. Avalanche transceiver, probe, shovel and other general snow safety gear will amount to 400€</p>

<p>Green Feet is a mobile bicycle garden that is designed to educate and engage.  It will be built and operated in Chicago (for now!).  Green Feet will be ridden across town to schools and local community events in order to educate kids and communities on the benefits and ease of organic gardening, as well as on the complexities and importance of ecosystems.</p>

</div></div>","What Is That? 
Green Feet is a mobile bicycle garden that is designed to educate and engage.  It will be built and operated in Chicago (for now!).  Green Feet will be ridden across town to schools and local community events in order to educate kids and communities on the benefits and ease of organic gardening, as well as on the complexities and importance of ecosystems.
Green Feet is going to be built on the back of a bicycle and will include a small compost bin, organic edibles, and an aquaponic set up [aquaponics is a type of gardening that incorporates the mutually beneficial relationships (or symbiotic relationships) that are present between fish and plants.]  Green Feet will be a fully functional garden and interactive classroom.  It will provide a place where kids can get their hands dirty learning about ecosystems from the plant life cycle to the living organisms that make soil.  Green Feet will also function as a community platform where we can host seed giveaways and bring-your-own-compost parties.  It is designed to be interactive and educational, with the operating mission of getting more people educated about the environment that surrounds us.
What Does Your Money Do?
100% of donations will go toward buying the materials needed for building this mobile garden.  Green Feet will be a top to bottom eco-friendly project, (or as much as I can make it).  Which means that I will primarily try to reuse / repurpose materials and buy Eco-friendly products.  I will also take great efforts to transport materials using only bike, public transportation, or another environmentally sound means of movement.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p> My name is Stephen Granger and I am trying to transform the way people commute!  Introducing the one-person commuter vehicle, CV1.  The Granger Motor Sports CV1 is uniquely designed to eliminate the wasted space and expense of a conventional commuter car or SUV.  This technologically advanced, environmentally friendly vehicle will dramatically limit damaging emissions and traffic congestion! And best of all…reduce the overall costs of commuter transportation!  I am trying to get the prototype build to unveil at the Austin Auto in May of 2012.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> My dream began several years ago.  I was driving home from work…the same 10 mile route I took every day…and noticed that every car on the road around me only had 1 person in it!  There had to be a better way!  We are all doing this every day!  We lug an empty car with us to and from work.  What a waste…not to mention what this is doing to our environment!  


The CV1 Is designed to reduce congestion and be environmentally conscious!


I have talked with lots of venture capitalists and angel investors.  Everyone says the same thing; “Brilliant idea…BUT I need to see a prototype!” This is where you can help!  This effort is to raise the $30,000 needed to build and promote a prototype. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> This money will go to complete the CV1 prototype.  The following is the break down of where that $30,000 will be going:

*Motor Cycle                                                                                 $4,000

*Company that Builds Race Cars to build Vehicle Components     $20,000

*Wheels / Tires                                                                              $500

*Paint / Body Work                                                                        $2,000

*Interior                                                                                          $2,000

*Misc.(cost over runs)                                                 $1,500

<p>Are you aware that the world's wildlife populations are half what they were 40 years ago, and within the next 40 years in the U.S. alone it's been projected that future development will result in a loss of 38 million acres (an area the size of Florida) of forest habitat alone?  Are you concerned about our natural world and looking for a way to help fight back these losses and prevent further listing of threatened and endangered species? If so, I urge you to make a donation to The Habitat Institute a nonprofit team of environmentalists, conservationists and scientists dedicated to helping organizations take into consideration all species—not just one or two—potentially affected by development or habitat restoration plans.   </p>
<p>I am Thomas O’Neill, Founder and Director of The Habitat Institute and my life’s work has been devoted to developing a patented process that takes into consideration and quantifies all wildlife so that their needs are represented and valued in aquatic and land acquisition and restoration projects.  The Habitat Institute is a (501(c) (3)) scientific and education  organization that believes promoting biodiversity is key to the sustainability of our lives and planet.  The Institute is unique in its approach in that many land-use planners use 25+ years old methodology that evaluates habitats for only a few animals.  Our approach has been through several independent scientific reviews including a National Academy of Sciences review process.</p>
<p>Previous successes include: </p>
<p>* Our multi-species approach involving 251 species and our alternative assessment  technique    was used to address sea-level-rise in the San Francisco South Bay;</p>
<p>* Our multi-species approach was the only method capable of assessing the downtown 9 miles stretch of the Los Angeles River.  Our analyses led the Los Angeles City Council to vote unanimously to raise $1 billion for restoration, which would be the largest civil restoration project in U.S. history; and</p>
<p>* Our multi-species approach was used by the state of Oregon to obtain a $150 million settlement to mitigate for 25-year-old wildlife habitat losses caused by construction and operation of federal dams; and</p>
<p>* Our single species approach helped delist the first endangered &amp; threatened fish species in U.S.</p>
<p>Based on the success of these and other projects over the past 18 years, The Habitat Institute is ready to move forward to expand its reach to help other public agencies, tribes, companies and organizations take into account the impact of their land planning on native species populations and their habitat.   We need your financial support to help increase awareness that we live in a multi-species world and each species counts.   Your support can make an immediate and real difference!  </p>
<p>With your donation, we can together focus on significant issues that ultimately can create jobs and a better quality of life for everyone.  Our approach also has the ability to start a whole new industry of appraisals to value nature, help develop and support new markets for carbon and biodiversity trading, and expand our approach to a national system for habitat valuations to be as wide-ranging and complete as possible. </p>
<p>If you have any questions or would like to discuss this further or want more information, please let us know by contacting <a href=""mailto:habitat@thehabitatinstitute.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">habitat@thehabitatinstitute.org</a>.  I hope to hear from you soon, and thank you in advance for your consideration and generosity.</p>

marina </strong>dell<em>'Istituto per l’Ambiente e l’Educazione Scholé Futuro
onlus </em>di Torino,
 selezionato dalla <em>Fondazione Tender to Nave Italia</em>di Genova per l’edizione
2014. </p>
<p>L'Istituto
vuole offrire un'esperienza unica di <strong>turismo sostenibile, studio, partecipazione</strong>,
scambio e divertimento a contatto con la natura e con educatori e formatori
esperti nel settore acquatico e socio-educativo. </p>
<p>Con Water Crew
Scholé promuove una cultura marinara consapevole stimolando l’interesse di un <strong>gruppo
di 12-14 ragazzi (normodotati e disabili) </strong>che verranno riuniti per cinque
giorni a bordo di Nave Italia per condividere un’<strong>esperienza di navigazione e formativa eccezionale</strong>,
tramite l’attivazione di un approccio educativo originale (<em>Edutainement</em>) che comprende attività
acquatiche, interazioni audio visive con i fondali marini, laboratori creativi
(es. a storia evolutiva e biogeografica del mar mediterraneo, interazioni con
organismi marini per analisi comportamentali, cambiamenti climatici e
sensibilizzazione al consumo consapevole, tecniche marinaresche).</p>
<p>Water Crew
rientra in un processo formativo ben piú ampio, inziato nel 2003 con la nascita
di <em>Pianeta Azzurro</em>, un progetto integrato che si propone di
diffondere l’educazione ambientale alla risorsa acqua nelle scuole, tra gli
studiosi, gli sportivi e gli appassionati, in Italia e nel Mondo, attarverso
attività ed iniziative, anche multimediali, tra cui il progetto “Sport e
Natura”.</p>
<p><strong>Crediamo
in forme di apprendimento alternativo, </strong>capaci di incoraggiare i ragazzi ad interagire, a far
parte di un progetto, ad aprirsi verso il nuovo e contribuire allo sviluppo
sostenibile delle proprie azioni quotidiane e come cittadini.</p>
<p>Il progetto è
strutturato in tre fasi che prevedono l'alternanza di momenti di analisi,
riflessione con momenti di navigazione e sport acquatici orientati alla
responsabilizzazione di ognuno nel suo rapporto con l’ambiente.</p>
<p>Ad esempio l'<strong>utilizzo dello snorkeling come pratica inclusiva </strong>e aperta a tutti è la risposta
appropriata ad esigenze di movimento, di benessere psicofisico. Immersi in
acqua i diversamente abili non solo facilitano il passaggio di flussi emotivi
ma riscoprono anche una differente attività motoria poiché la deambulazione è
agevolata dalla possibilità di muoversi con una forte riduzione del proprio
peso.</p>
<p>L’Istituto
vede come prioritaria la presa di coscienza della necessità di <strong>modificare
la relazione uomo-natura</strong>, processo per cui il ruolo
dell’educazione ambientale diventa fondamentale, poiché veicolo per <strong>promuovere
il valore della diversità</strong>sia
essa biologica, culturale, sociale o disabilità.</p>
<p>L’azione
proposta mira a sviluppare competenze e attività che consentano l’<strong>interazione tra i partecipanti e la valorizzazione
dei disabili</strong>, soprattutto come persone e in relazione al
contesto naturale che li circonda.</p>
<p>E’ sempre più
evidente la necessità di una crescita della consapevolezza nelle nuove
generazioni sull’uso sostenibile delle risorse e su un riorientamento degli
attuali stili di vita e di apprendimento. Questo è ancora più vero per persone
affette da deficit motorio, psichico o sensoriale, spesso escluse da quei
processi di crescita che favoriscono la percezione, l’analisi e la comprensione
dei cambiamenti, al fine di <strong>diventare cittadini consapevoli e responsabili </strong>nei confronti di sé, dell’ambiente e
della comunità, intesa non solo come società di appartenenza, ma anche come
pianeta.</p>
<p>La<strong>navigazione rappresenta un momento di rottura con la quotidianità </strong>e consente di mettere in
pratica un programma pedagogico volto allo sviluppo dell'autonomia e della
consapevolezza delle proprie capacità.</p>
<p>Siamo alla
ricerca di finanziamenti che ci aiutino a realizzare il progetto e che diano la
possiblità ai ragazzi di vivere un'esperienza indimenticabile dal punto di

Water Crew
rientra in un processo formativo ben piú ampio, inziato nel 2003 con la nascita
di Pianeta Azzurro, un progetto integrato che si propone di
diffondere l’educazione ambientale alla risorsa acqua nelle scuole, tra gli
studiosi, gli sportivi e gli appassionati, in Italia e nel Mondo, attarverso
attività ed iniziative, anche multimediali, tra cui il progetto “Sport e
Natura”.
Crediamo
in forme di apprendimento alternativo, capaci di incoraggiare i ragazzi ad interagire, a far
parte di un progetto, ad aprirsi verso il nuovo e contribuire allo sviluppo
sostenibile delle proprie azioni quotidiane e come cittadini.
Il progetto è
strutturato in tre fasi che prevedono l'alternanza di momenti di analisi,
riflessione con momenti di navigazione e sport acquatici orientati alla
responsabilizzazione di ognuno nel suo rapporto con l’ambiente.
Ad esempio l'utilizzo dello snorkeling come pratica inclusiva e aperta a tutti è la risposta
appropriata ad esigenze di movimento, di benessere psicofisico. Immersi in
acqua i diversamente abili non solo facilitano il passaggio di flussi emotivi
ma riscoprono anche una differente attività motoria poiché la deambulazione è

L’Istituto
vede come prioritaria la presa di coscienza della necessità di modificare
la relazione uomo-natura, processo per cui il ruolo
dell’educazione ambientale diventa fondamentale, poiché veicolo per promuovere
il valore della diversitàsia
essa biologica, culturale, sociale o disabilità.
L’azione
proposta mira a sviluppare competenze e attività che consentano l’interazione tra i partecipanti e la valorizzazione
dei disabili, soprattutto come persone e in relazione al
contesto naturale che li circonda.
E’ sempre più
evidente la necessità di una crescita della consapevolezza nelle nuove
generazioni sull’uso sostenibile delle risorse e su un riorientamento degli
attuali stili di vita e di apprendimento. Questo è ancora più vero per persone
affette da deficit motorio, psichico o sensoriale, spesso escluse da quei
processi di crescita che favoriscono la percezione, l’analisi e la comprensione
dei cambiamenti, al fine di diventare cittadini consapevoli e responsabili nei confronti di sé, dell’ambiente e
della comunità, intesa non solo come società di appartenenza, ma anche come
pianeta.
Lanavigazione rappresenta un momento di rottura con la quotidianità e consente di mettere in
pratica un programma pedagogico volto allo sviluppo dell'autonomia e della
consapevolezza delle proprie capacità.
Siamo alla
ricerca di finanziamenti che ci aiutino a realizzare il progetto e che diano la
possiblità ai ragazzi di vivere un'esperienza indimenticabile dal punto di
vista formativo e personale.
L'imbarco é previsto per il 13 maggio a Genovae lo sbarco il 17 maggio a Livorno. 
Invitiamo i nostri soci, lettori, amici, cittadini attivi nel
settore educativo e/o ambientale e tutti coloro che credono nell'educazione non
formale e nello sviluppo sociale a supportare il nostro sforzo e a fare una donazione.

Plus besoin de convaincre, le monde entier sait que nous vivrons d’importants changements climatiques – et tout ce qui s’y rattache – si nous ne changeons pas nos habitudes de consommations. Ceci incluant évidemment la façon dont nous nous procurons notre nourriture. L’utilisation de serres 4 saisons devient une alternative intéressante puisqu'en plus de nous procurer de la nourriture complètement biologique, elle réduit l’impact environnemental créé par les distances phénoménales que notre nourriture doit parcourrir avant de se retrouver dans notre assiette.
Pour ces raisons, l’Université de Moncton (Campus de Moncton) a comme ambition de construire une serre pour les étudiants. 
 But primaire 
Tout d’abord, les étudiants auront l’opportunité de développer des habiletés de jardinage, tout en étant sensibilisés aux bénéfices d’un mode de vie autosuffisant et d’une alimentation saine. Il y aura différentes activités organisées, comme des ateliers de jardinage ouverts à tous les étudiants et membres de la communauté. 
 But secondaire
La serre pourra être utilisée à des fins pédagogiques et permettra de bâtir des liens entre les étudiants et la communauté. Par exemple, les étudiants en nutrition pourront entretenir une partie du jardin dans le but d’y faire pousser des aliments utiles à leurs laboratoires. De plus, nous avons l'intention d'ouvrir une partie du jardin à la communauté. Il serait en effet possible de mettre sur pied un projet de récréation thérapeutique avec les étudiants en récréologie pour les personnes à besoins spéciaux. Des opportunités de bénévolat seraient ainsi créées pour les étudiants voulant s'impliquer. 
 But tertiaire 
Enfin, la serre sera un projet écologique exemplaire qui utilisera un minimum d’énergie et d’argent pour son fonctionnement; elle sera approximativement dix fois moins coûteuse à entretenir qu’une serre typique. Elle sera principalement chauffée par l’énergie solaire et utilisera une technologie innovatrice spécialement conçue pour les températures extrêmes du Canada. Des serres semblables ont été implantées au Yukon, en Ontario et en Angleterre et elles ont toutes démontré une grande efficacité. Étant donné que ce sera la première serre de ce genre construite au Nouveau-Brunswick, elle suscitera certainement l’intérêt des membres de la communauté et des entreprises environnantes. Par cette initiative, l’Université de Moncton pourra augmenter sa visibilité tout en démontrant son leadership au niveau écologique.
 
 
Voici un tableau présentant les dépenses nécessaires à la construction de la serre:

Dépenses prévues                                                                 Coût ($)
 
Plan détaillé de la serre                                                                  300      
2 cadres et 2 vitrages                                                                   5 000    
2 générateurs de mousse commerciale                                        6 000    
Pompe, réservoir et contrôles                                                      2 000    
Câblage, plomberie et préparation du site                                   3 000    
Murs (en avant et en arrière, avec porte)                                     2 000    
5 litres de solution de bulles (isolation)                                          250     
Outils de jardinage                                                                          200      
Dépenses diverses (clés pour la serre, etc.)                                    100      
Main-d'oeuvre professionnelle                                                    5 000    
Énergie par année pour alimenter la serre                                      150     
Total                                                                                         24 000
 
Pour les entreprises désirant avoir leur logo affiché à l’intérieur de la serre, nous allons procéder par categories de commanditaire:
BRONZE : 500 $
ARGENT : 1 000 $
OR : 2 000 $
Aidez-nous à bâtir pour l’avenir!
